  "<p>Europe should consider sharing vast amounts of intelligence and information on its citizens with the US to establish a \"Euro-Atlantic area of cooperation\" to combat terrorism, according to a high-level confidential report on future security.</p> <p>The 27 members of the EU should also pool intelligence on terrorism, develop joint video-surveillance and unmanned drone aircraft, start networks of anti-terrorism centres, and boost the role and powers of an intelligence-coordinating body in Brussels, said senior officials.</p> <p>The 53-page report drafted by the Future Group of interior and justice ministers from six EU member states - Germany, France, Sweden, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic -argues Europe will need to integrate much of its policing, intelligence-gathering, and policy-making if it is to tackle terrorism, organised crime, and legal and illegal immigration.</p> <p>The report, seen by the Guardian, was submitted to EU governments last month following 18 months of work. The group, which also includes senior officials from the European Commission, was established by Germany last year and charged with drafting a blueprint for security and justice policy over the next five years.</p> <p>Baroness Scotland, the UK attorney general, had observer status with the group to assess the implications for Britain, whose legal system, unlike continental Europe, is based on the common law.</p> <p>The group's controversial proposals are certain to trigger major disputes, not least its calls for Europe to create an expeditionary corps of armed gendarmerie for paramilitary intervention overseas.</p> <p>The report said the EU would fail to beat terrorism unless it developed a full partnership with Washington, a process currently pushing ahead in fits and starts.</p> <p>\"The EU should make up its mind with regard to the political objective of achieving a Euro-Atlantic area of cooperation with the United States in the field of freedom, security and justice,\" it said.</p> <p>Such a pact, which should be finalised by 2014 at the latest, would entail the transfer of vast volumes of information on European citizens and travellers to the US authorities. Negotiations have long been under way to agree such a pact, but have been bedevilled by divergences in privacy law and data protection regimes.</p> <p>The US is already demanding that EU countries sign up for a battery of security measures on transatlantic flights and the supply of personal information on passengers if they are to enjoy visa-free travel to the US. Under one such accord struck in March between Washington and Berlin, the Germans are to make DNA and biometric information on travellers available.</p> <p>The European Commission and the US homeland security department are also trying to iron out discrepancies in privacy laws to allow the wholesale exchange of data. The aim is to reach a binding international agreement this year or next.</p> <p>Last month the American Civil Liberties Union wrote to MEPs pressing Brussels to reject US pressure because the US is \"a country that, in privacy terms, is all but lawless ... US privacy laws are weak. They offer little protection to citizens and virtually none to non-citizens.\"</p> <p>While urging a comprehensive transatlantic electronic pact, the Future Group focuses mainly on boosting police cooperation and integration between EU states, policies which would reinforce the powers of European agencies and institutions bearing acronyms such as Europol, Eurojust, Frontex, and Sitcen and perhaps see new agencies established to deal with security and intelligence operations.</p> <p>Several member states, not least Britain, will have deep qualms about the proposals, with the British likely to balk at automatic pooling of national intelligence.</p> <p>Anti-terrorist campaigns can only be effective if \"maximum information flow between [EU] member states is guaranteed,\" the report said. \"Relevant security-related information should be available to all security authorities in the member states.\" It said \"networks of anti-terrorist centres\" was a possible solution.</p> <p>While cooperation between national police forces in the EU was advancing, the report conceded that the sharing of espionage and intelligence material was a \"considerable challenge\" as it clashed with the \"principle of confidentiality\" that is the basis for successful exchanges.</p> <p>The report calls for a bigger role for \"Sitcen\" in coordinating intelligence sharing. Sitcen, or the Joint Situation Centre, is a shadowy intelligence body based in Brussels which started as a foreign policy tool supplying analysis on international crises to Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, but which now focuses on counter-terrorism and internal security policy.</p> <h2>Key points</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> National police forces to cooperate and integrate</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Improve European-level crisis management</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Need to harness the talents of \"different actors\" in fighting terrorism</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> National security services and intelligence agencies need to collaborate much more closely</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> New EU internet-based propaganda campaign to defeat radicalisation and terrorist recruitment</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Create \"European Gendarmerie Force\" for deployment and intervention abroad.

  "<p>In 1969, during the cold war, Nicol Peacock, who has died of cancer aged 77, led a team of five British scientists to the Kurchatov Nuclear Fusion Institute in Moscow to probe a controversial Soviet claim. Intricate dealings and manoeuvres had preceded this mission. Soviet assertions about the high performance of their nuclear fusion experiments, which used the \"tokamak\" concept, had been presented at an international conference in Novosibirsk in 1968 - and had been treated with scepticism by western scientists. Control of this process is of utmost importance, as it promises endless amounts of energy without the release of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>The tokamak uses a toroidal-shaped magnetic chamber in which a hot plasma is confined, to produce fusion energy. The term originated with a Russian acronym for a \"toroidal chamber with magnetic coils\". The concept replicates the fusion of hydrogen atoms, which releases the energy that powers the sun and stars. </p> <p>Peacock and his team confirmed the Soviet claims by measuring the plasma temperature with a laser beam, using novel techniques. The news had an astonishing impact on the scientific community in the west and represented the biggest advance yet in fusion research. The tokamak was soon adopted as the main line of research, as it continues to be today.</p> <p>For Peacock, the Moscow mission was the high point in his career, as upon his return to Britain he was invited to present the results to an astonished audience at the American Physical Society Conference in Los Angeles in November 1969. He went on to confirm his international reputation as a nuclear fusion scientist. With his death Britain has lost one of its leading figures in the science of measurement techniques in fusion energy research.</p> <p>Peacock was born in the small town of Darvel, east of Kilmarnock, the son of a marine-engine fitter and a lace weaver. He was educated at the local Mair's school, Darvel junior secondary school and Kilmarnock academy. He obtained his first degree in physics at Glasgow University, his tutor being Sir Sam Curran, who later became chief scientist at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) laboratory at Aldermaston, Berkshire. Peacock obtained his PhD from Liverpool University and was subsequently awarded a DEng degree.</p> <p>In 1956 Peacock was hired by Curran to work at Aldermaston, where a nuclear-fusion research programme had recently started. Peacock entered this programme full of enthusiasm and developed measurement techniques in ultraviolet and x-ray spectroscopy. </p> <p>In 1964 Peacock was awarded a Robert Blair fellowship, which enabled him to spend the next two years at what is now the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. There he worked with Jim Tuck, a member of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project, who had remained at Los Alamos and had become interested in thermonuclear fusion.</p> <p>In 1965 Peacock returned to work at the newly established Culham Laboratory in Oxfordshire, dedicated to thermonuclear fusion research. At Culham, Peacock established a large group within one of the two experimental divisions. His ability to attack any physics problem and get to the bottom of it paid off: the laboratory directors gave him an unparalleled degree of freedom to work on diverse, but relevant, problems in fusion research. During the ensuing years, measurement techniques were developed with the assistance of colleagues and British PhD students.</p> <p>Among the projects Peacock worked on at Culham was the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak, the largest in the world. In France the large ITER international tokamak - the successor to JET - is currently being built. Although it will not generate energy on to the grid, it should prove that fusion can work. It has a power output of 500 megawatts, as opposed to JET's 16 megawatts, and will hopefully be followed by the first commercial fusion power plant.</p> <p>During the years from the 1970s until his retirement in 1996, Peacock published more than 100 scientific papers with colleagues and PhD students as co-authors. Several awards followed: the Civil Service merit appointment (1974); a research fellowship in the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (1985); an honorary professorship at Queen's University Belfast (1994); and the chairmanship of the International Subcommittee on Atomic and Molecular Data for Fusion. </p> <p>After retiring, Peacock remained passionate about his work and was a frequent visitor to Culham. He will be remembered not only for that famous mission to Moscow, but also for his achievements at Aldermaston and Culham. </p> <p>Peacock leaves his wife Maureen and two daughters, Fiona and Lindsay. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nicol Jamieson Peacock, scientist, born February 7 1931; died July 19 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday August 15 2008.

  "<p>This weekend, eager astronomers will be scanning the night skies in expectation of a dazzling celestial light show. The Perseid meteor shower, so-called because meteors appear to be radiating from the constellation of Perseus, is an annual event that has been observed for more than 2,000 years. </p> <p>\"The meteors are formed when the Earth passes through the orbit of the Swift-Tuttle comet,\" explains Professor Ian Morison, astronomer at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. \"Essentially, a comet is a dirty snowball and, when it passes the sun, the ice turns to gas and releases dust particles. If the Earth passes through a comet's orbit, those particles are swept up into our atmosphere. As they are moving at about 20,000 miles an hour, they have a lot of energy and it makes them glow.\"</p> <p>While many people (including Morison) headed to China for an optimum view of the recent solar eclipse, the prime location for Perseid spotting is closer to home: your back garden. \"There's no ideal geographical point to see the Perseids, but there are optimum conditions to see as many shooting stars as possible,\" says Morison. \"First, find somewhere dark, away from street lights if possible. If you're in a city, then head to the east side so you're not looking over the city's lights. Then you want to look towards the constellation of Perseus in the east of a clear night sky after midnight.\" It could start anytime from tomorrow and go on until August 14.</p> <p>Jodrell Bank is hosting a sold-out Perseid Meteor Shower party this Saturday, featuring a barbecue, some skilled pointing towards the sky and, if things go well, lots of oohing. \"My personal best with the Perseids is 75 in an hour, but given the right conditions, you could see hundreds - possibly thousands - of shooting stars if it develops into a meteor storm,\" says Morison. So come midnight, go into your back garden and brace yourself for a hot-dust spectacular.</p>",
  "<p>Texas was accused yesterday of putting Americans abroad at risk by defying the international court of justice and the government of Mexico to carry out the execution of a Mexican national.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn was put to death by lethal injection on Tuesday night at a prison north of Houston. His lawyers said that the execution breached America's treaty obligations, which give foreign nationals such as Medell\u00edn the right to consult consular officials. </p> <p>\"With this action, our nation has broken a commitment willingly made by our president and our Senate when we agreed to this treaty,\" said Donald Francis Donovan. \"We must now hope that other nations stand stronger in their promises than we do, lest our own citizens be placed at risk elsewhere.\"</p> <p>The Mexican government had filed a letter of protest about the case, and the ICJ had demanded a judicial review for Medell\u00edn. President George Bush had also asked Texas to review the case but was overruled by the supreme court.</p> <p>Lawyers for Medell\u00edn, who was convicted of rape and murder, then sought a last-minute delay in his execution date, hoping to give Congress time to enact legislation that would bring America into line with an international treaty giving foreign citizens accused of crimes the right to consult consular officials.</p> <p>The Texas authorities and the supreme court both rejected the appeals.<br>Medell\u00edn was the first of 51 Mexican citizens on death row similarly denied access to their diplomats.</p> <p>After spending virtually all of his adult life in prison, Medell\u00edn, 33, used his final moments to apologise to the parents of his two teenage victims. The parents watched his execution. \"I'm sorry my actions caused you pain,\" Medell\u00edn told them. \"I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbour hate.\" </p> <p>The Mexican government has now sent a note of protest to the US state department, expressing \"its concern for the precedent that [the execution] may create for the rights of Mexican nationals\".</p> <p>Medell\u00edn and five other teenage boys took part in the rape and murder of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14, in 1993.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers are to fight a European Union move which could block Britain's use of advanced airline passenger lists to combat illegal immigration, the Home Office said yesterday. The EU is proposing that passenger lists for flights into and out of Europe should to be shared between security authorities in all member states before take-off, but only for combating terrorism or organised crime.</p> <p>The passenger data includes name and address, and up to 19 pieces of information including travel itinerary, frequent flyer history and billing details. Airlines have to provide the information up to 48 hours in advance so it can be used for checks against security databases.</p> <p>Sensitive personal data such as ethnic origin, religious beliefs or political opinions are excluded. Airlines must retain the passenger records for 13 years.</p> <p>The Home Office already collects this data on flights in and out of Britain and under its e-Borders programme has details for 50 million passenger movements which it uses to operate \"no-fly\" lists against immigration offenders. The programme has been at the centre of the government's attempts to reassure public opinion over immigration by holding out the promise of electronically keeping track of everybody who enters and leaves Britain.</p> <p>\"As currently drafted there is a real risk that the EU passenger name record [PNR]proposal would degrade e-Borders by prohibiting the use of PNR data for combating immigration offences. We will therefore lobby strongly for the framework decision not to preclude the use of PNR for this purpose,\" said a Home Office response yesterday. </p> <p>The House of Lords EU scrutiny committee warned ministers that an attempt to extend the use of PNR data beyond what was acceptable to other EU states would force Britain into opting out of the European agreement.</p> <p>But the Home Office is determined to press ahead. A spokesman said that the e-Borders programme had already led to 25,000 alerts and 2,100 arrests for offences ranging from murder and possession of firearms to tobacco-smuggling.</p>",
  "<p>Tim Brabants calls for me at the railway station. It is hard not to spot him. Black Golf with silver vinyl lettering screaming \"Tim Brabants, sprint canoeing world champion, 2007.\" He's wearing a pair of flash shades and a vest that shows off his gladiatorial biceps.</p> <p>I'm expecting a man who revs loudly and is a little bit in love with himself. But he doesn't and isn't. He looks embarrassed when I mention the car. \"I do feel self-conscious in it. I do. It does seem rather pretentious having my name and world champion on it.\" At the same time, he knows the car is a measure of how far he has come. Despite the fact that he had won kayaking medals at every level and is a medical doctor, until recently he was driving his mother's old Fiat Punto. You don't get rich quick in the paddling business.</p> <p>Brabants, 31, is one of the British favourites for a gold medal - in the 1,000m (his best event) and 500m sprints. Canoeing has long been overshadowed by its more celebrated sporting cousin, rowing - partly because rowing is associated with public schools and the class system, partly because of Britain's incredible success at the sport over the past 20 years. When he tells people what he does, they tend to ask if he knows Sir Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. Canoeing has probably received more attention in recent months than ever before because of the disappearing trick of \"Canoe Man\" John Darwin. Actually, he says, canoeing has always had an identity crisis. Canoeing and kayaking are different sports, despite the fact that a kayak is a type of canoe. Brabants explains the difference: kayakers sit in a closed cockpit, use a rudder and a double-ended paddle; canoeists race kneeling on one knee in an open cockpit with a single ended paddle and they are rudderless. Of course, he was always going to be a kayaker, he says, as if it's a no-brainer.</p> <p>It's 9.30am, a silent, golden day in Teddington, south-west London. At the Royal Canoe Club, the view is wonderful - trees galore, boats galore, swans drifting imperiously on the Thames. Brabants loves it here. \"This morning we had a nature lesson - two grebes courting on the river, doing their ritual dance where they copy one another. Eric Farrell, my coach, pointed it all out to me - I think he's got a secret phone line to Bill Oddie.\"</p> <p>It wasn't so calm an hour ago, he says, when he was training. \"We had a nylon windsock on a rope, tied it round the cockpit and hung it out of the boat. It slows you down so even when you're going flat out you can't go faster than walking pace. It's like when runners run dragging a tyre.\" Exhausting, he says.</p> <p>Today is typical for Brabants in his build-up to the Olympics - breakfast at 6.30am (muesli and fruit), training on the river for an hour and a half, a second breakfast in Teddington (scrambled eggs or beans on toast), another morning training session; lunch (high carbs and protein - baked potato and tuna and a bit of fruit), afternoon sleep for an hour, another 90-minute training session, supper (steak, new potatoes, veg and salad) and an early night.</p> <p>His mother first took him kayaking when he was 10 years old at the Elmbridge canoe club in Weybridge. He had not been a particularly sporting boy but he loved it from the off - the water, the nature, the intensity, the competition. \"I didn't have a very competitive edge before but all of a sudden I'm like, I wanna win this, I'm gonna win this, I wanna get faster.\"</p> <p>Brabants came from an academic family and, like the legendary canoeist Mike Jones, he went on to become a doctor. When most students were out indulging themselves, he retreated to bed for early nights so he could be up training before medical school. \"Nearly all my life has been socialising with paddlers. Because in the evening you're just too tired to go out and do anything.\" He studied at Nottingham because it was the only city that had both a medical school and water facilities close by.</p> <p>Although it is a life of denial, he says it is also one of supreme selfishness - pursuing his own interest to extremes. Do you have to be obsessive to live such a regimented life? \"It's not so much obsessive, it's motivated and having a passion. When you get the results it makes all the hard times when you're out on the river in winter and you've got ice forming on your boat and your hands are freezing, it makes it all worthwhile.\"</p> <p>His eyes are sea green, his skin tanned from the outdoor life. We are in the clubhouse and Brabants is making coffee. He says he is so lucky - he shows me the fruit bars and trainers and tops he gets for free from sponsors. He qualified as a doctor in 2002 but has spent little time practising. \"I feel a bit of a fraud when I'm described as a doctor.\" He worked for 18 months in hospitals in Nottingham and Jersey after the 2004 Olympics but since February 2006 he has been training full time.</p> <p>After this summer he will return to medicine for a couple of years, hopefully to a job in accident and emergency before focusing on 2012. There are times when he wonders if he has made the correct decision, particularly when he sees fellow students getting on and making themselves financially secure, while he gets by on his lottery funding and odd bits of sponsorship. \"It's just about enough to pay my mortgage and extortionate food bill. I'm not putting anything away. I've not got any savings. In that respect, I'm 31 now and I've got nothing to show for my name because everything's gone into sport.\"</p> <p>But then his friends tell him he's the lucky one and he knows they are right. Again, he mentions the privileges - the free fruit bars, the three Olympics, the visits to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen. His heroes come from his own sport: the paddlers at his first club who went on to the Olympics and became role models. Lewis Hamilton is another role model - young, brave, honest. But there are so many anti-role models in sport, he says, particularly football. The trouble is they can get away with virtually anything. He cites the example of Joey Barton. \"If I was imprisoned for assault I wouldn't get lottery funding, I probably wouldn't be allowed to use lottery-funded coaches and facilities and I wouldn't be able to work as a doctor.\"</p> <p>In 2000 at his first Olympics he came from nowhere to secure a bronze medal. The feeling was unbeatable. \"We raced in the same place as the rowers so we watched them go on the podium and winning medals and you're like, wow that's amazing. I just knew I had to step it up a gear to win a medal in the final and that's what happened. In the last 150m I came from fifth through to third. Then it was me going on the podium.\" It still seems to send a shiver through him.</p> <p>At the 2004 Games in Athens came his greatest sporting disappointment. He broke the world record in his 1,000m heat (a record that still stands) and then slumped to fifth in the final. \"I felt I'd let a lot of people down. Family, friends, my coach, the support staff.\"</p> <p>Is it this failure what has kept him going since? \"Yes, I had unfinished business after Athens.\" I tell him he sounds like a contract killer. He laughs. \"Yeah! That's what it felt like. Well, I don't know what it feels like to be a contract killer. I toyed with the idea of finishing after Athens if it had gone well but it didn't, so I knew when I came back I was going to try and nail it this time.\"</p> <p>He's in the form of his life. He came second by a fraction at the 2006 world championships and last year he won the 1,000m and was second in the 500m. But this is the big one. He's having his photo taken, the picture of calm. \"I'll be in a really bad mood if I don't win a medal,\" he says suddenly, and with feeling. How long for? \"Four years - minimum.\"</p> <h2>Tomorrow's interview</h2> <p>In the final part of our series on Britain's best hopes for gold in Beijing, Kelly Sotherton talks about being the mouthiest member of Team GB, her mysterious kidney illness and mad love for Arsenal</p>",
  "<p>Irvine Robbins started with a single ice-cream parlour in Glendale, Calfornia, and with his brother-in-law, Burton Baskin, turned it into Baskin-Robbins, the world's biggest ice-cream chain. Robbins, who has died aged 90, was an innovator in both business and ice-cream - part of Baskins-Robbins' success was due to their being among the first franchised retailers. Robbins claimed his franchising model inspired Ray Kroc, to whom he passed it on while supplying milkshake blenders to Kroc's hamburger stands, called McDonald's. </p> <p>But Robbins' real genius lay in the marketing of ice-cream itself. More than just a food, ice-cream is the great comforter of American life, and Robbins helped turn it into a great indulgence. The explosion of Baskin-Robbins' 31 exotic flavours killed postwar America's traditional preoccupation with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry once and for all. Robbins' idea was to surprise customers with new flavours, and the idea grew into commemorative tastes, such as Baseball Nut, to celebrate the Brooklyn Dodgers moving to Los Angeles (it came complete with a strawberry - slang for a derisory cheer - for the umpires), Cocoa A Go Go to celebrate the twist, Beatle Nut, when the Fab Four arrived in New York in 1964, and Lunar Cheesecake, to commemorate the moon landings. He also concocted such staples as Rocky Road, pink bubblegum and, his personal favourite, Jamoca almond fudge.</p> <p>Robbins was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to parents who had emigrated from eastern Europe. His father moved the family to Tacoma, Washington, and went into the dairy business with his brother. Irvine began working in the retail store attached to the dairy. A naturally exuberant person who became a cheerleader at his new high school by jumping off a balcony while leading the school yell, Robbins was taken with the pleasure that scoops of ice-cream brought his customers, and quickly realised a little exuberance could help sales. The standard banana split became a \"Super Banana Treat\", and bright signs marked each sundae on offer.</p> <p>He graduated with a degree in political science from the University of Washington in 1939, returned to the family business and married Irma Gevurtz. He served in the army during the second world war and, after his discharge, cashed in an insurance policy he had received for his bar mitzvah, moved to Glendale and opened the Snowbird ice-cream store. Baskin, who had married Robbins' sister, had run a clothing store in Chicago before the war, but after his discharge from the navy, followed Robbins, and opened his Burton's Ice Cream in nearby Pasadena. Robbins' father had advised against the brothers-in-law going into business together, lest they inhibit each other's ideas.</p> <p>But by 1948 there were five Snowbird stores, and three Burton's, and the brothers-in-law decided to merge. With the merger came their 31st flavour, chocolate mint, which gave them one for every day of the month (vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry were never counted among the 31). It would also be three more than Howard Johnson's, who famously offered 28. Within a year they were up to 43 stores, growing quickly after deciding to sell each store to its manager, what would come to be known as \"franchising\". They renamed the company, with a coin-toss deciding that Baskin's name would come first.</p> <p>Soon they were out of the managing business, producing ice-cream at a factory in Burbank, concentrating on the standardised look of the stores and a constant churning of the flavours they sold. Overall, more than 1,000 flavours have filled the scoops of Baskin-Robbins stores, and employees have always been allowed to eat as much as they like, because, as Robbins said, \"I don't want my employees stealing.\"</p> <p>In 1967, the partners sold their business, by then some 500 stores, to United Fruit for $12m. The premium ice-cream business took off as baby-boomers reached adulthood. Within six months, Baskin had died, aged 54, of a heart attack. Robbins worked for the company until retiring in 1978. It is now owned by Dunkin' Donuts, and boasts some 5,500 stores worldwide. Robbins was an ardent anglophile, and an unlikely supporter of Newcastle United, but his Grape Britain ice cream, perhaps fortunately, never left the laboratory.</p> <p>Robbins retired to Rancho Mirage, his house equipped with a six-seat soda fountain, where he ate three or four scoops daily, frequently adding banana ice cream to his breakfast cereal. </p> <p>He is survived by Irma, daughters Marsha and Erin, and son John, who rejected the family business, became a vegan, and is the author of Diet for a New America.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Irvine Robbins, businessman, born December 6 1917; died May 5 2008</p>",

While the Bahamas, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica built billion-dollar tourist industries, Haiti languished as a regional basket case best known for boat-people, gang warfare, kidnappings and Somalia-levels of poverty.</p> <p>\"This seafront used to be full of foreigners and restaurants but nobody comes now because of the insecurity,\" lamented Nicola Sivieux, 41, a fisherman in the port of Cap-Haitian. </p> <p>Earlier this year there was hope of a revival. President R\u00e9ne Pr\u00e9val restored political stability and a 9,000-strong UN peacekeeping force imposed some order in the slums. The Organisation of American States, a pan-regional body, promised to fund training for hotel and restaurant workers and the government was due to pitch donors a $270m (\u00a3138.5m) plan to rebuild the industry. </p> <p>Then, in April, food riots erupted in the capital, Port-au-Prince, images of mayhem returned to TV screens and the prime minister and tourism minister resigned. \"Whatever happens in Port-au-Prince has an immediate impact on the image of Haiti as a vacation destination,\" the ex-minister, Patrick Delatour, told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Until Haiti becomes more stable and safe, talk of mass tourism is a fantasy, said Camille Charlmers, a development consultant and former government adviser. \"We have a terrible reputation. What we could do, however, is promote a niche of eco and heritage tourism.\"</p> <p>Meantime the industry had just one asset, Labadee. The resort's tactic of marketing Haiti as Hispaniola was not ideal but at least it brought tourists, said Charlmers. \"Even if not all of them realise they are in Haiti.\"</p> <p>Royal Caribbean's brochures recently started referring to Haiti as well as Hispaniola. The biggest player in a shrivelled industry, the company ferries hundreds of thousands of visitors ashore - albeit for only a few hours - and pays the government S$6 (\u00a33) per head. In addition to employing 300 locals the company says it allows 200 traders to sell artisan wares inside the resort. </p> <p>In the same waters where slave ships once sailed come vessels such as the Liberty of the Seas, a 17-storey, 160,000-tonne behemoth which stretches more than 300 metres (1,000ft) and boasts shopping arcades, cinemas, a climbing wall and an ice rink.</p> <p>Passengers are lured ashore with offers of paragliding, jet-skiing, snorkelling and zip-lining, where they are harnessed to a cable and hurtled from a hilltop down to the ocean. The ride lasts 45 seconds and costs $80 (\u00a341), more than Haiti's average monthly salary.</p> <p>From his stall outside the resort's walls, Daniel Vital, 52, a local, watched the tourists zipping overhead. He lacked permission to enter Labadee and no tourist had dared leave the razor wire to visit the little market. \"I've sold nothing today,\" he sighed. \"I'm used to that.\"</p> <p>Four teenage boys, who also lacked permits to enter, hiked around the perimeter hoping to encounter a stray tourist and sell a traditional wooden face mask for $10 (\u00a35). \"There are no jobs, this is the only thing we can do,\" said Gabriel Degavian, 19, the eldest.</p> <p>This form of garrison tourism gets a mixed response from website travel reviews. \"I felt like I was on a movie set. The water is crystal blue and the vegetation is so green and lush. Just beautiful!\" said a writer from Indiana. \"But I noticed the fence and quickly realized the tourist beach was nothing like the area where the locals live. It made me feel like a snotty, selfish tourist. I was enjoying complimentary drinks and food while the people who called the place home were struggling to survive.\"</p> <p>Another reviewer, from Pennsylvania, was more concerned about being ripped off by people selling their wares. \"If we paid what they were asking, everything would have cost $85. Instead we paid $16! One guy fell on the ground and said 'You're killing me, boss lady.' My wife said 'I don't want to kill you, I'm just not paying that price!' It was great!\"</p>",

She read classics, she writes beautifully and this doesn't sound at all like her style, quite apart from her sentiments. I would imagine it's been done today. Students for a Free Tibet have in the past had tampering with their own internal emails.\" </p> <p>The blog juxtaposes severe criticism of what Fairbrother saw in Tibet with awkward words of approval. \"We could feel the atmosphere of oppression just walking through the streets and monasteries - our guide was hushed by a monk when he uttered '14th Dalai Lama', and guiltily giggled as he mentioned the official 11th Panchen Lama (the 2nd most important leader in Tibet before China) who is a Chinese replacement for the 'real' Panchen Lama, who has been in prison since his recognition at the age of 6. </p> <p>\"Even so, monks are not being tortured on the streets, as the impression is given, and in fact just seem to get on with their business within their monasteries, or walk around the streets, seemingly unbothered. The Chinese maintains [sic] an impressive presence, and there is still a large amount of Han immigration, which is sad, but nothing to the extent that is advertised at home.\" </p> <p>Lhadon Tethong, the executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, said she assumed the blog had been altered after the detentions. \"It is something that we are pretty used to. I am just surprised that they didn't take it down instead of trying to misrepresent her views.\" </p> <p>She confirmed further protests are likely during the games. \"There will certainly be people of conscience who will try to speak out in peaceful ways while the world spotlight is on China.\"</p> <p>Online demonstrations against what some Chinese people see as Western propaganda have been increasing in recent months, focusing on a variety of news outlets, advocacy groups and human rights organisations. Websites belonging to SaveTibet and Free Tibet campaigns were targeted by hackers, while the website of CNN was hit in April when Chinese protesters became angry about the TV news channel's reporting on Tibet.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Thom, SFT's national coordinator, told the Observer his members planned to hold protests in Beijing and post blogs as events unfold, but security prevented him from giving more details. He added that the SFT's site had fallen victim to sophisticated cyber attack.</p> <p>In a phone call from his 15 metre-high protest point yesterday, Thom told supporters: \"We have done this action today to highlight the Chinese government's use of the Beijing Olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights.\" The state news agency, Xinhua, said police had ended the protest after 12 minutes, but SFT said activists had been there for an hour before security officers led them away peacefully. </p> <p>\"As far as we know, foreigners gathered illegally, and we express our strong opposition to that,\" said Sun Weide, for the Beijing organising committee. \"We will resist all attempts to politicise the Olympics. We have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of China.\"</p> <p>The news of the protesters' release came hours after the text was released of a speech President George Bush is to make in Thailand today, criticising China's human rights record. He will say: \"America stands in firm opposition to China's detention of political dissidents, human rights advocates and religious activists. We speak out ... not to antagonise China's leaders, but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for China to develop its full potential.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Case aborted after jury plans own investigation</h2> <p>The trial of a man charged with murdering a Sydney model in 1995 was aborted yesterday after the judge said there was evidence some jurors had planned to hold an independent investigation into the case. Justice Graham Barr said one juror told a journalist last week that some jurors were planning to hold a private inspection of the site where Caroline Byrne died, a cliff face near Sydney Harbour . A 1998 inquest into her death said that she may have jumped, fallen or been pushed to her death. But a 2005 investigation recommended that Byrne's ex-boyfriend, Gordon Wood, be charged with her murder. <br><strong>Associated Press in Sydney</strong></p> <h2>'Human eye' camera breakthrough for robots</h2> <p>Scientists in the US have produced a prototype \"human eye\" camera like the watchful computer in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey that could revolutionise photography and possibly robot technology. The device, the size and shape of an eye, has a light-sensitive curved \"retina\", capable of sharper images and a wider field of view than current flat surface photo-detectors used in digital cameras. The journal Nature reported yesterday that the electronics were built on to a stretched out elastic membrane which was then allowed to spring back to its original curved shape. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>10-month-old boy killed in drive-by shooting</h2> <p>A 10-month-old baby was shot dead in his car seat during a drive-by shooting in Puerto Rico, police said yesterday.

Lieutenant Miguel Vel\u00e1zquez said police were investigating a possible dispute between the father, Yamil de J\u00e9sus, who has been detained several times on weapons charges, and local criminals linked to drug trafficking. He said Yabucoa, where the shooting occurred, was a \"hot spot\": \"There's complete savagery.

Confortala, 37, was taken into the military hospital there in a wheelchair. He had been stranded on K2 after an avalanche of ice blocked climbers descending the summit on Friday. The dead came from South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, France, Ireland, Serbia and Norway. <br><strong>Associated Press in Islamabad</strong></p>",
  "<p>In the past five years bomb attacks claimed by Islamist groups have killed hundreds across the Indian cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. An Indian Muslim was even involved in the failed assault on Glasgow airport in July last year. Yet George Bush reportedly introduced Manmohan Singh to his wife, Laura, as \"the prime minister of India, a democracy which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims\". </p> <p>To be fair to Bush, he was only repeating a cliche deployed by Indian politicians and American pundits such as Thomas Friedman to promote India as a squeaky-clean ally of the United States. However, Fareed Zakaria, the Indian-born Muslim editor of Newsweek International, ought to know better. In his new book, The Post-American World, he describes India as a \"powerful package\" and claims it has been \"peaceful, stable, and prosperous\" since 1997 - a decade in which India and Pakistan came close to nuclear war, tens of thousands of Indian farmers took their own lives, Maoist insurgencies erupted across large parts of the country,<strong> </strong>and Hindu nationalists in Gujarat murdered more than 2,000 Muslims.</p> <p>Apparently, no inconvenient truths are allowed to mar what Foreign Affairs, the foreign policy journal of America's elite, has declared a \"roaring capitalist success story\". Add Bollywood's singing and dancing stars, beauty queens and Booker prize-winning writers to the Tatas, the Mittals and the IT tycoons, and the picture of Indian confidence, vigour and felicity is complete. </p> <p>The passive consumer of this image, already puzzled by recurring reports of explosions in Indian cities, may be startled to learn from the National Counterterrorism Centre (NCTC) in Washington that the death toll from terrorist attacks in India between January 2004 and March 2007 was 3,674, second only to that in Iraq. (In the same period, 1,000 died as a result of such attacks in Pakistan, the \"most dangerous place on earth\" according to the Economist, Newsweek and other vendors of geopolitical insight.) </p> <p>To put it in plain language - which the NCTC is unlikely to use - India is host to some of the fiercest conflicts in the world. Since 1989 more than 80,000 have died in insurgencies in Kashmir and the northeastern<strong> </strong>states. </p> <p>Manmohan Singh himself has called the Maoist insurgency centred on the state of Chhattisgarh the biggest internal security threat to India since independence. The Maoists, however, are confined to rural areas; their bold tactics haven't rattled Indian middle-class confidence in recent years as much as the bomb attacks in major cities have. </p> <p>Politicians and the media routinely blame Pakistan for terrorist violence in India. It is likely that the ISI, Pakistan's intelligence agency, was involved in the bombings two weeks ago in Ahmedabad and Bangalore, which killed 46 people. But their scale and audacity also hints that the perpetrators have support networks within India. </p> <p>The Indian elite's obsession with the \"foreign hand\" obscures the fact that the roots of some of the violence lie in the previous two decades of traumatic political and economic change, particularly the rise of Hindu nationalism, and the related growth of ruthlessness towards those left behind by India's expanding economy. </p> <p>In 2006 a commission appointed by the government revealed that Muslims in India are worse educated and less likely to find employment than low-caste Hindus. Muslim isolation and despair is compounded by what B Raman, a hawkish security analyst, was moved after the most recent attacks to describe as the \"inherent unfairness of the Indian criminal justice system\". </p> <p>To take one example, the names of the politicians, businessmen, officials and policemen who colluded in the anti-Muslim pogrom in Gujarat in 2002 are widely known. Some of them were caught on video, in a sting carried out last year by the weekly magazine Tehelka, proudly recalling how they murdered and raped Muslims. But, as Amnesty International pointed out in a recent report, justice continues to evade most victims and survivors of the violence. Tens of thousands still languish in refugee camps, too afraid to return to their homes.</p> <p>In an article I wrote for the New York Times in 2003 I underlined the likely perils if the depressed and alienated minority of Muslims were to abandon their much-tested faith in the Indian political and legal system. Predictably Hindu nationalists, most of them resident in the UK and US, inundated my email inbox, accusing me of showing India in a bad light.</p> <p>It is now clear that a tiny but militantly disaffected minority of Indian Muslims has begun to heed the international pied pipers of jihad. Furthermore, there is no effective defence against their malevolence. Conventional counter-terrorism strategies - increased police presence or greater surveillance - don't work in India's large, densely populated cities. Nor do draconian laws such as the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act, which allowed police to hold suspects without charge for six months and was repealed in 2004. </p> <p>Gung-ho members of the middle class clamour for Israeli-style retaliation against jihadi training camps in Pakistan. But India can \"do a Lebanon\" only by risking nuclear war with its neighbour; and Indian intelligence agencies are too inept to imitate Mossad's policy of targeted killings, which have reaped for Israel an endless supply of dedicated and resourceful enemies. </p> <p>As we now know, the promoters of pre-emptive strikes and rendition have proved to be the most effective recruiting agents for jihad. In that sense the Indian government's inability to raise the ante, to pursue an endless war on terror or to order 150 million of its poorest citizens to reform their religion is a good thing. For it helps to maintain a necessary focus on terrorism as another symptom of a wider crisis that will be alleviated not so much by better policing, intelligence gathering or consultation with mullahs as by confronting socioeconomic frustrations and political grievances. </p> <p>The absence of \"tough\" retaliation also leaves the jihadi terrorists incapable of dealing more than a few glancing blows to the Indian state. Certainly, a hysterical response of the kind that followed the 7/7 attacks in London - a crackdown on civil liberties and demonisation of Islam - would in India only have accelerated the radicalisation of the Muslim minority. </p> <p>It is true that nihilist terrorism has no greater adversary than people who refuse to be terrorised or provoked. There have been remarkably few instances of retaliation against Muslims in the wake of terror attacks. In Mumbai, where nearly 200 people were killed by bomb explosions on commuter trains in 2006, normal life resumed even more quickly than in London in July 2005. </p> <p>But the resilience of India's poor, who have no option but to get on with their lives, should not be taken for granted, or used to peddle India as a stable, business-friendly country. For their stoicism in the face of terror also expresses the bitter wisdom of the weak: that violence is far from being an aberration in the inequitable world our political and business elites have made.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Pankaj Mishra is the author of Temptations of the West: How to Be Modern in India, Pakistan and Beyond <br><a href=\"mailto:kannauj@gmail.com\">kannauj@gmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Just like blades, phrases can be blunted by overuse. Talk of avoiding \"catastrophic climate change\" is so familiar, the words no longer instantly stir up apocalyptic images. But in the light of remarks from Defra's chief scientific adviser, it is worth recalling what would be involved. As the Guardian reports today, Professor Bob Watson says Britain must prepare for an increase in temperatures of 4C - a rise deep in catastrophe territory. Even at 3C between a fifth and a half of all species would face extinction. At 4C some human populations could be heading the same way. Swaths of Africa and the Mediterranean would be parched of water and see food production decimated. Over the decades, melting polar ice sheets would increase sea levels to the point where whole island nations - not to mention parts of Britain - would be smothered. The release of CO2 could spiral beyond human control if the heat stopped natural forest fires from burning themselves out. In the darkest scenario, civilisation would be on the slipway to oblivion.</p> <p>Mercifully, that is far from certain - but with warming in excess of 2C very little is. Is Prof Watson encouraging fatalistic acceptance of it? Emphatically not. His responsibilities include advising not just on climate policy, but also flood defences. And the only responsible way to plan coastal barriers is on the basis of an honest appraisal of what the future could bring - however depressing that may be. In line with the Stern report and the IPCC, Prof Watson believes all governments should seek to contain global warming to 2C. He merely acknowledges that the chance that this target will not be met is too real to be ignored.</p> <p>That is putting it mildly. Even if global emissions could be stabilised at current levels, a rise in excess of 2C would be a substantial possibility. Indeed it might become a probability if China and India follow the west and clean up their industry to tackle acid rain. (The sulphurous gases which cause that problem also offset global warming by reflecting sunlight.) Instead of stabilising, however, emissions continue to rise, and the political obstacles on turning the tide remain formidable. The passing of George W Bush next year will remove only one of several. The US is now so far above Kyoto baselines, that even when a more constructive president takes over - as either candidate would prove - they may demand a deal that takes account of this catastrophic starting point. But other countries who have been working to cut emissions might resist this as a reward for failure. There will be other sticking points, too. China is now the world's biggest emitter, so no meaningful deal can exclude it. But there is scope for argument about whether galloping emissions from the workshop of the world are the responsibility of the Chinese producers or the western consumers they serve. A recent report by the Stockholm Environment Institute has underlined this point.</p> <p>The Stern report established that - from the point of view of the global economy - prevention is cheaper than cure. For individual countries, however, who consider the calculus in isolation, the balance will often be reversed. After all, even with a sizable economy such as Britain, whatever sacrifices are made to cut emissions the direct effect on the global emissions - and thus the climate - will be marginal, and self-interest starts to dictate a strategy of mitigating catastrophe instead. </p> <p>Prof Watson acknowledges this miserable - yet hard - logic by suggesting preparations be set in train for a rise of up to 4C. But he rightly argues that rich countries can still recast the logic through coordinated action. A joint agreement to find a way of making carbon capture work, and to fund it, would be a first step. Every country could argue that the vast funds involved are unaffordable. Each, however, is one part of the same planet - and it can no longer afford delay.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese authorities last night came under fire from the United States government for their lack of tolerance after an American gold medallist was banned from visiting Beijing for the Olympic Games, which open tomorrow.</p> <p>The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said the US would complain after Joey Cheek, a speedskater who won gold in Salt Lake City in 2002, was informed yesterday morning that his visa had been revoked, hours before he was due to travel. Cheek is a co-founder of Team Darfur, which has encouraged 73 athletes to use the platform provided by the Olympics to protest at China's support for the Sudanese government, which is accused of sponsoring genocide in the region.</p> <p>\"I didn't see it coming,\" said Cheek. \"I figured once they gave me a visa, I wouldn't imagine they wouldn't allow me to come in later. That was a big shock. I wasn't expecting to get a call the evening before I was leaving for Beijing. I don't begrudge them the Olympics, I think they'll do well with them, but there are so many of their government's policies that I find repulsive, especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else.\"</p> <p>The decision by a host city to stop an Olympic champion attending the Games is highly unusual, but the International Olympic Committee notably failed to censure China or offer any support for Cheek yesterday. Giselle Davies, the IOC's spokeswoman, said: \"The Olympic Games are about the athletes, the active athletes that are competing. Joey Cheek had no formal role and is not accredited in any capacity, so in that sense he is a normal citizen who requires a visa like any other. As such this is really a matter for the Chinese government to respond to, not the IOC.\" </p> <p>Earlier in the day four US cyclists apologised to the Beijing organising committee after arriving in the city on Tuesday wearing masks. The athletes' statement was acutely embarrassing to the Chinese as they have been at pains all week to stress the absence of any threat to public health from pollution.</p> <p>The US Olympic Committee's chief executive, Jim Scherr, said the four cyclists had been \"overly cautious\", but confirmed that the masks had been issued by his officials to around a third of the team.</p> <p>President Bush angered Beijing by hosting five Chinese dissidents at the White House last week and his presence here this weekend is hugely sensitive. Bush, who criticised China's human rights record yesterday, is planning to cycle on the mountain bike course tomorrow before attending the opening ceremony.</p> <p>The Beijing organising committee attempted to divert attention from the controversies by revealing its plans for the launch of the Games at the Bird's Nest stadium. More than 15,000 performers, 5,000 of them drawn from the military, will take part in a three-and-a-half hour ceremony that organisers promise will steer clear of references to recent Chinese history and focus instead on \"the best of modern China\" and cultural aspects of the country. Among the performers will be the British singer Sarah Brightman, who will sing the official Beijing anthem for the first time.</p> <p>The 313-strong British team will be led into the stadium by the swimmer Mark Foster, who is competing in his fifth Games. Foster, the first swimmer since Anita Lonsborough to carry the flag, was selected for the honour by his fellow athletes, who for the first time voted for who they would like to head the team.</p>",
  "<p>Salim Ahmed Hamdan was born in Wadi Hadhramaut, a fertile oasis in the mountainous desert of south-eastern Yemen, in around 1970. </p> <p>The son of a Bedouin farmer and shopkeeper, he received little formal education after being orphaned at a young age. </p> <p>Forced to depend on the charity of his relatives, he moved to the port city of Mukalla, where he did odd jobs. </p> <p>Following Yemen's unification in 1990, Hamdan moved north to Sana'a to seek his fortune, but fell on hard times. </p> <p>The prospects for someone with only a limited education were poor, but he found his way to the Martyrs' mosque, where he picked up work as a driver. </p> <p>It was there that he mixed with jihadis. Six years later, with the offer of a regular salary and free passage, he joined a group to oust the Russian-backed government in Tajikistan. </p> <p>With access to Tajikistan impossible, the men assembled in Afghanistan and asked for the help of Osama bin Laden, who had recently arrived after being expelled from Sudan.</p> <p>Hamdan was employed by Bin Laden as a mechanic and driver for his car pool. With pay guaranteed, he followed the advice of his boss when he married a Yemeni girl and started a family.</p> <p>His wife's sister was married to Nasser al-Bahri, one of Bin Laden's bodyguards, who was arrested in 2000 on suspicion of terrorism after the bombing of the USS Cole. </p> <p>Despite his brother-in-law's incarceration, Hamdan continued to work as Bin Laden's driver because, he said, he needed to support his family. </p> <p>In late November 2001, with the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan well under way, he was picked up near the border of Pakistan by a group of Afghan warlords and handed over to the US, who transferred him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>Hamdan made headlines last year with a court challenge that led the supreme court to declare the first military commissions authorised by the US president, George Bush, unlawful. </p> <p>Congress subsequently passed legislation authorising a new system of tribunals.</p> <p>Lawyers for Hamdan argued at the time that Bush had violated basic military protections with his November 2001 executive order setting up the tribunals.</p> <p>They said suspects brought before the tribunals did not have the right to a lawyer of their choice or to see the evidence against them. </p> <p>Even if they were acquitted and freed, the verdict could be reversed by the defence secretary.</p> <p>The lawyers argued that this framework made the tribunals unconstitutional because it allowed the president to define the crime and select the prosecutor and judges who acted as jury.</p> <p>Hamdan alleged that he was beaten, forced into painful positions, subjected to extreme cold temperatures and threatened with death in 2001 and early 2002.</p> <p>He also described being kept in such extreme isolation after being transferred to Guant\u00e1namo that he once considered \"pleading guilty in order to get out of here\".</p> <p>After Hamdan won his landmark ruling against the first military commissions, he was again charged under the new system of tribunals.</p> <p>After seven years in detention, he was tried by a military court and convicted of supporting terrorism but acquitted of the more serious charge of conspiring with al-Qaida.</p>",
  "<p>A month ago, at the G8 summit in Tokyo, developed nations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/11/g8\">showed</a> how out of touch they were with the changing reality of the world. With last week's breakdown of the Doha round of global trade talks in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/business/worldbusiness/31trade.html?em&amp;ex=1217649600&amp;en=ab0166a68ef58dd0&amp;ei=5087%0A\">Geneva</a>, the rising economic powers are making their voices heard.</p> <p>Those who relish the relative decline of the west can only cheer. The era when it could dictate trade terms through the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its predecessors certainly belongs to history. But the new dawn may not turn out to have quite the rosy glow that the declinists detect.</p> <p>First, the big developing economies are far from forming a solid grouping with identical interests. Brazil, in particular, has taken a different position this summer to India, China or African countries. As a country that has the natural resources and food that others want, it is in a position of independence that dictates its approach to trade. China and India are all for opening up the markets of others for their exports, but followed lines at Geneva that would have limited the degree of reciprocation, which, in turn, would have worked against the poorer agricultural producers. As for the fourth member of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\">Bric</a> group, Russia's energy riches put it in a category of its own \u2013 and the G8 showed it trying to have one foot in the developed camp and the other with its Bric colleagues. </p> <p>Add in the specific concerns of the other major source of new wealth, the Gulf states, which are usually conveniently omitted from such discussions despite their financial muscle, plus the differences within Latin America and Africa, and you are left with a rich variety of interests subject to wide variations. Not to mention resource-rich Australia, or South Korea or virtually indefinable Indonesia.</p> <p>I suppose it might be argued that there is no need for overall order in world trade, and that country-to-country deals represent the future. But a broad-based system with clear rules and procedures is calculated to encourage both general exchanges and bilateral trade as the example of China since it joined the WTO demonstrates.</p> <p>Global trade anarchy, on the other hand, would encourage commercial wars, preferential arrangements and competitive devaluations. The post-1929 example provides sufficient evidence of that. The financial crisis that is brewing around us would be hugely aggravated if it were accompanied by the kind of me-first policies that characterised the 1930s. Global financial flows are out of control; the last thing that is needed is a breakdown of the global trading system which, for all its exploitation, has brought more people into a materially upwardly-mobile system than ever before in human history.</p> <p>Some may not like any of this, but they have never made a convincing case as far as I can see. Coastal China may have a plethora of sweatshops and western companies may pad their profits by moving production there; but why do 100 million migrant workers move from the inland to the coast to work in them? Because they offer a way to material betterment for them and for those who stayed back on the farm and get their remittances. That may be unpalatable to western liberals, but it represents a choice that must be respected. The People's Republic chose this path 30 years ago, and its people have voted overwhelmingly with their feet to follow it.</p> <p>Nor should the anti-western argument be allowed to fool anybody that China, India and other developing countries were acting at Geneva in anything but their own direct self-interest. There is nothing surprising or reprehensible about that, but nor is there anything exemplary. Being poor may mean you should be helped, but it does not mean you are right. </p> <p>For all its travails, the achievement of the WTO and its predecessors has been to provide a forum which could produce solutions of general interest from negotiation and mutual concessions, based on self-interest that went beyond the most basic of calculations. This was, naturally, less dramatic than the <a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Seattle.asp\">Seattle demonstrations</a> or the breakdown in Geneva. Global structures and systems find it hard to get a good press, particularly in an age where many see them as the exploitative emanation of the evil west and overlook the fact that the WTO is too democratic for its own good. <a href=\"http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/24926.html\">Winston Churchill</a>'s remark about democracy might be trotted out here.</p> <p>For all its faults, the Doha round is the best way of organising world trade we have. Those who glory in its crisis as vindication of their crusade against the US-led policies that have underpinned globalisation might answer a simple question: what would they put in its place, who would they install in the driving seat, and how would they ensure continued growth for the poorer nations that know how trade can lift their people out of poverty?</p>",

And as with yesterday's Sugar Mouse by Oh, Atoms, Red Light Company's song Meccano is a meditation on childhood, the titular toy a symbol of, or metaphor for, growing old and apart. As mainman Frenneaux says: \"It's based around an imaginary conversation between two old friends and the distance growing between them as their lives go on. It's about the regret of a passing friendship.\" It's a good deal less twee and winsome (compliments, by the way) than Sugar Mouse. Meccano is surging, dynamic, built by indie boys for arenas, the sort of anthemic fist-waver gloom-rock bands go for when they want to convey triumph-over-adversity or majestic sorrow. It's powerful yet hook-laden, and the more we play it, the more we can't believe they went on tour as support to Editors, not because they didn't deserve to, but because they threaten to eclipse them \u2013 and White Lies for that matter - as Britain's premier new exponents of elegiac pop-metal. <br> And they only formed last year, which makes Meccano and other tracks such as With Lights Out, about the suicide of one of Frenneaux's childhood friends, all the more impressive. And if they sound accomplished and cohesive as a unit after such a short amount of time together, bear in mind that they come from, if not all four, then several corners of the globe. Richard Frenneaux was born in England and spent his formative years in Australia and New Zealand. Shawn Day is from Wyoming, the least populated state in America, but was born in Osaka, Japan. James Griffiths is from Bridgend in Wales, Paul Mellon is from Motherwell in Scotland and Chris Edmonds is from Maidenhead. And yet they sound like we imagine all bands want to sound: like old mates, childhood friends even, who have been performing together for years. </p> <p>They almost didn't get together at all. Frenneaux and Day met on the internet after Day saw an advert posted by Frenneaux. This was Tuesday afternoon; the band had a gig in London on the Friday. So Day played a song Frenneaux had written called Scheme Eugene and immediately emailed him to say, \"I want to play my bass in London. I don't fuck around\". Indeed, he doesn't: he packed, went to the airport, bought a ticket, maybe even a magazine and some Juicy Fruit, and flew across the Atlantic. Problem was, on arrival at Gatwick he was unable to provide proof of sufficient funds for his stay in the UK and was detained for six hours. The immigration officer finally agreed for the band to meet with Day while insisting that he had to catch the first flight back to America the following morning. So Day jumped in the band's van and had an unplugged audition on the spot. He was in, with one proviso: no guitar solos. Within a month Day had sold up in the States, he was living in Blighty, and before they knew it Red Light Company were being written about in glowing terms in the Guardian's excellent New Band of the Day column.<br> <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Red Light Company storm into contention with an Arcade Fire-like blast of intense emotion.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It's like White Lies never happened \u2013 and, with RLC around, they might not get the chance. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Build a career with such ease it will be like they're playing with a toy construction kit. Or something.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Write a song about Duplo. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The single Meccano is released by LaVolta on Monday. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> White Lies, Editors, U2, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/redlightcompany\">www.myspace.com/redlightcompany</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Das Wanderlust.</p>",
  "<p>If you want the conservative blogosphere's take on John McCain, look no further than <a href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/redstate\">RedState's online store</a>. The conservative group-blog is hawking the usual right-wing guff: Obama: The Antichrist mugs and wistful Bush-Cheney '08 bumper stickers. But as of last week, they've extended their line. Now, they're also offering T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan: \"The enemy of my enemy is \u2026 McCain\".</p> <p>That's a pretty underwhelming endorsement, but at this point McCain will be grateful for anything he can get. The Arizona senator has faced an up-hill struggle to win over the GOP base. Few conservative bloggers have forgiven him his stand on campaign finance reform or his views on immigration, let alone his longstanding love affair with the liberal media. \"McCain has built his political fortune on kicking people right of centre in the teeth,\" <a href=\"http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=10908\">sighed</a> Karl at Protein Wisdom - so his backers shouldn't \"be surprised when conservatives, libertarians and classic liberals fail to swoon at McCain's success to date.\" Last year, when McCain's campaign was floundering, many right-wing bloggers cheered or jeered from the sidelines. As the senator staged a comeback, some bloggers did their best to disrupt his efforts. <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/flashnyt.htm\">Matt Drudge</a>, the dean of right-wing cyberspace, even helped thwart McCain's efforts to kill off a New York Times story suggesting that the presidential hopeful had given \"special treatment\" - nudge, nudge - to a female lobbyist.</p> <p>Since winning the nomination, McCain has sought to charm the GOP's cyberchattering classes. So far, though, he's had little success. Conference calls with prominent bloggers fell flat when it emerged that progressive netizens had also been invited to join the calls. Other right-wingers cried foul when the McCain campaign asked supporters to <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/ActionCenter/BlogInteract/BlogInteract.aspx\">copy and paste approved talking points</a> in the comment sections of high-profile blogs in exchange for \"points\" which could be exchanged for McCain-branded swag. Arch-conservative bloggress <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/06/24/what-the-mccain-campaign-needs/\">Michelle Malkin</a>, who continues to savage the Arizona senator for his \"flip-flop-flipping\" on immigration and offshore oil drilling, mocked McCain's attempts to repackage himself for the Republican base: \"It's not fundamentally flawed messaging, it's a fundamentally flawed candidate,\" she wrote. \"The sooner Republicans reconcile themselves to that, the better.\"</p> <p>But while right-wing bloggers remain in no rush to embrace McCain qua McCain, most seem to be gradually coming around to the idea that he is, at least, not Barack Obama. That's led to an uneasy truce. While some die-hard conservatives are still kicking away at the GOP candidate - the online equivalent of voting for Bob Barr - the majority now seem happy to more or less ignore McCain and instead devote their time and energy to roughing up his Democratic opponent. Their shift in focus has been made easier, of course, by McCain's newfound relish for negative attacks, particularly in recent ads portraying Obama as a cross between Paris Hilton and Moses. \"Those were clearly the most effective commercials the McCain campaign has put out \u2014 ever,\" <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjQ0M2VmNDRkZWIwMDlhZWQzMzBiMDY5YTk5MDJmOWI=\">writes Lisa Schiffren</a> at National Review's blog, the Corner. \"The celebrity one made a clever point. The 'The One' ad was brilliant ... As Richard Nixon, who thought a lot about these things, always said, politicians can recover from almost anything but being laughed at.\" </p> <p>Right-wing bloggers have also relished the task of rebutting suggestions in the liberal media that McCain's recent attacks were racially charged - and trumpeting the McCain camp's counter-claims that it was Obama himself who first played the race card. \"Needless to say, the Times defends Obama's 'dollar bills' line, which was the first injection of race into the campaign, on the risible ground that he was merely 'the victim' of a 'racial attack,'\" <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2008/08/021156.php\">writes John at the PowerLine blog</a>. \"In the Times' world, you simply cannot criticise an African-American candidate, or you are a racist. Unless, of course, the African-American is a Republican.\"</p> <p>The upshot is that as you click through conservative cyberspace these days, you'll find that on many sites there's little more than a cursory mention of the GOP nominee. Instead, bloggers are spewing forth page after bile-spattered page of attacks on \"the One\". That's good news for McCain, who in his own right would struggle to earn more than a slow hand clap from the right-wing punditocracy. By defining the election as a referendum on Obama, he's been able to distract attention from his own record and keep the right-wing echo chamber focused on amplifying his attacks. </p> <p>The issue now is how far McCain can ride his \"enemy of my enemy\" shtick. Some bloggers have suggested that by helping McCain regain momentum, the conservative blogosphere could be paving the way for a new rift. \"Pretty soon the press will be turning against his trendy opponent and endorsing <em>him</em>. Then McCain will really be in trouble,\" <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2008/08/01/is-mccain-peaking-too-early/\">speculates PajamasMedia blogger Roger Simon</a>. \"If the New York Times backs him, he's sunk.\" That's not likely to happen anytime soon, of course, but there's a grain of truth to Simon's argument. McCain's tenuous truce with right-wing bloggers is likely to last only as long as the GOP nominee trails in the polls. The more confident conservatives are that McCain is heading for victory, the more willing they'll be to rock the boat along the way.</p>",
  "<p>Texas today was accused of putting Americans abroad at risk for defying the International Court of Justice and the government of Mexico to carry out the execution of a Mexican national.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn was put to death by lethal injection last night at a prison north of Houston. His lawyers said the execution breached America's treaty obligations which give foreign nationals such as Medell\u00edn the right to talk with consular officials.</p> <p>\"With this action, our nation has broken a commitment willingly made by our president and our Senate when we agreed to this treaty,\" said Donald Francis Donovan.</p> <p>\"We must now hope that other nations stand stronger in their promises than we do, lest our own citizens be placed at risk elsewhere.\"</p> <p>The Mexican government had filed a letter of protest about the case, and the ICJ had demanded a judicial review for Medell\u00edn.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mcdonalds\">McDonald's</a>, one of Britain's largest low wage employers, is creating 4,000 new jobs in Britain to cope with increased demand for its keenly priced Big Macs, McNuggets and McFlurry ice creams. </p> <p>While upmarket US healthfoods supermarket chain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/06/supermarkets.useconomy\">Whole Foods</a> may pull out of the UK altogether, McDonald's appears to be thriving in the economic downturn. </p> <p>Its recruitment drive comes two weeks after McDonald's operations in the UK and France generated some of the strongest growth for the world's largest fast food chain. European comparable sales for the three months to June 30 rose 7.4%, with the UK and France slightly ahead of this figure. </p> <p>The group's 1,200 owned and franchised outlets in the UK have seen a rise in the number of customers of two million a month. </p> <p>The chain, which will open 10 new sites this year, is confident it is taking market share from fast food competitors and from diners trading down to McDonald's value offering. </p> <p>About 60% of McDonald's staff are aged under 22, the age at which they are entitled to claim the adult minimum wage of \u00a35.52 an hour. For staff under 18, McDonalds pays a starting rate of \u00a34.25 an hour \u2013 the statutory minimum is \u00a33.40 \u2013 although this rate may be lower at some of the group's franchised restaurants. A McDonald's restaurant manager's package is about \u00a345,000, the company said. </p> <p>The average time spent in a McDonald's job is 2.5 years, which is at an all-time high for the chain. </p> <p>The UK and Ireland chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, says relations with staff are strong, helped by its provision of access to literacy and numeracy educational programmes. </p> <p>Easterbrook launched a campaign last year to change perceptions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/16/fooddrinks.mcdonalds\">jobs in McDonalds</a>, calling for the dictionary definition of McJob \u2014 \"an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, especially one created by the expansion of the service sector\" \u2014 to be changed. </p> <p>The campaign won the support of more than two-thirds of customers in an in-store survey, but was not supported by unions experienced in campaigning for rights among low paid workers. </p> <p>Relations between the fast food chain and organised labour have frequently been strained. </p> <p>Eleven years ago, a judge in the famous McLibel court case described McDonald's in his judgement as \"strongly antipathetic\" to union activity. </p> <p>Easterbrook has since said \"That was a long time ago\". He says unionisation \"has never been an issue to our staff, as far as I am aware\". </p> <p>Its latest recruitment drive \u2014 adding to the 67,000 staff working for McDonald's and its franchisees \u2014 attempts to make a virtue of the McJob tag. </p> <p>\"We feel the time is now right to take another step forward and start celebrating the 'McJobs' we offer,\" said David Fairhurst, the company's chief people officer. \"This campaign is an important milestone in the evolution of McDonald's recruitment advertising \u2013 signalling a more confident and assertive attitude towards the 'McJob' term.\" </p> <p>McDonald's points out it is listed in the Financial Times' Top 50 Great Places to Work; is one of the top 50 companies in the Where Women Want to Work index; and has been in the Times' top 100 graduate employer league table for the last eight years. </p> <p>Last year, it rolled out free wi-fi access across its UK restaurants in an attempt to attract more mobile workers and laptop users.</p>",
  "<p>Once again, immigration takes centre stage on the Danish political scene. Denmark has one of tightest immigration policies in the European Union and this time it is a ruling by the European court of justice that has kick-started the row. The court <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7525472.stm\">ruled last week</a> that the Irish government should not prevent spouses of EU citizens who are not themselves EU citizens from living in the Republic of Ireland. The court found that the 2006 regulation introduced by the Irish government <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0725/breaking40.html?via=mr\">is in breach of a 2004 directive</a> on freedom of movement for EU citizens, a core principle of EU citizenship. The verdict means that non-approved asylum seekers will have the right to settle in any given EU country if they are married to an EU citizen, and \"all\" it takes to get married to a non-EU citizen is to go to another EU country, stay there for a few weeks and then return.</p> <p>While Denmark is far from being the only country affected by the verdict, the political and media reactions in Denmark <a href=\"http://euobserver.com/843/26557\">far outweigh</a> those of other member states \u2013 immigration issues have been front-page stuff all summer. Denmark is not alone in disagreeing with the court: the UK and nine other EU countries agree in principle with the Danish government. In response to a query on the issue, the <a href=\"http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk\">Home Office</a> said: </p> <blockquote> <p>The decision goes against the spirit of the directive which is about free movement for EU nationals and we were one of 10 member states supporting the Irish position. All member states will be carefully considering the judgment and its implications. </p> </blockquote> <p>It would appear, however, that there is precious little time for careful consideration in Denmark. The Danish integration minister, Birthe Roenn Hornbech, is in the eye of a political storm that encompasses the whole centre-right government. The ruling party is under pressure from its political backer, the Danish People's party (DPP), to take the court's decision to the EU demanding exceptions from the ruling for Denmark. Pia Kjaersgaard, the leader of the DPP, is demanding that Denmark retain the power to dictate who is to get a residence permit, not the EU: \"our party is demanding an influence on EU matters. We should tell the EU and the court that we and only we control matters of immigration in Denmark\", <a href=\"http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2008/08/03/194140.htm\">Kjaersgaard said</a>. According to a recent poll, more than half of Danes agree with her. Centrist politicians are busy trying not to loose ground to the ever more popular rightwing nationalists and both the government and the social democratic opposition have issued warnings to the EU and in particular the EU court of justice, which is claimed to be far too politically active. </p> <p>Immigration and in particular the integration of Muslims remains high on the political agenda in Denmark and there are votes to be lost by not adopting a hard line on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/04/denmarklosestolerance\">foreigners and immigration</a>. The nationalistic political climate has let to a situation where Denmark's immigration service has (probably) knowingly differed from EU directives. Although the integration minister admitted this week that the government had been caught napping, there are likely to be serious political consequences both domestically and on the European scene.</p> <p>As European law takes precedence over national legislation in such matters, the member states have to follow the court's ruling in applying national immigration policy and in Denmark this may prove tricky indeed. The government has been relying on the support of the DPP since 2001; the rightwingers have to a large extent been dictating immigration policy and are in no mood to let the government apply EU directives to the letter. This leaves the prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen with an unenviable choice: confront the EU (and sacrifice a planned top job in Europe), or oppose his political backers on the domestic scene.</p> <p>The heated debate in Denmark speaks loudly about the Danes' continuing unease with immigration and its multi-ethnic society, but it also throws up a potentially wider European problem of sovereignty on delicate matters such as immigration and the active integrationalist role of the European court of justice.</p>",
  "<p>This election was effectively over this July 4 \u2013 Independence Day, our national celebration of Not Being British. The backyard barbecue is the traditional rite performed this time of year, complete with watermelon, homemade ice cream, fresh corn on the cob and somebody's aunt's icebox cake. And hotdogs.</p> <p>All of those things were safely intact this Independence Day, but there were two indicators that the American public has already made up its mind about who will occupy the White House for the next four years. The first was the sheer number of such celebrations. Rocketing petrol prices have made casual trips to the beach or the lake less preferable to staying home and enjoying the backyard. Folks are having a hard time just budgeting out enough to get back and forth to work, much less weekend and holiday excursions.</p> <p>The second important indicator was <a href=\"http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008807020363\">what's on the grill</a>. Two years ago it was steaks and salmon, high-end cuts of meat that were well within the reach of the middle class. This year? Chicken, hamburgers and hotdogs. <em>Lots</em> of hotdogs.</p> <p>That's a warning sign. Now, I'm not running down hotdogs. Everyone likes a hotdog, from the basic ketchup-and-mustard to exotic regional variations (in the South, it's usually mustard, chili and slaw, for the record). American kids can live indefinitely off of hotdogs. But the number of them in your life is usually tied more to your income level than your culinary preference. They are the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/28/sales-of-spam-rise-as-con_n_103995.html\">meat-of-last-resort</a> to most families. When you can buy a pack of them along with buns, throw in a can of chili, and <em>still</em> pay less than a gallon of petrol, that tweaks the American psyche painfully.</p> <p>While hamburgers and hotdogs are as American as they can be (despite their Germanic roots), they are also the food of the working class \u2013 and the middle class, when times are hard. This year a lot of folks were choking down their third hotdog and dreaming of the T-bone steaks of yesteryear. To be eating a hotdog on July 4 \u2013 when you aren't a kid \u2013 is a sign of trouble. </p> <p>Thanks to a convenient calendar this year I attended four local barbecues within cheap driving distance and <em>everyone</em> had hotdogs ... and harsh criticism for the Republican party. </p> <p>I didn't indulge exclusively in liberal barbecues \u2013 my GI tract just can't take that much hummus. The Republican barbecues tend to have better beer and better meat, as well as traditional, easy-to-identify food with no lofty pretensions of vegetarianism. Even the vegetable dishes have meat in them. When it comes to politics and food, my head leans left but my stomach definitely leans right. But this year: hotdogs and cheap beer all over.</p> <p>Conversation topics at these affairs (after work, sport and gossip) ran steadily from the pump price of petrol to the war, the economy, the other war, the mortgage loan crisis and the election. I met only three people that weekend who were whole-heartedly supportive of John McCain. The rest of these southern white conservatives, once the backbone of the GOP's southern machine, were either reluctantly considering Barack Obama, thinking about backing the hopeless Libertarian party bid of former congressman Bob Barr in protest or opting out of politics this year altogether. </p> <p>It was a fascinating study \u2013 the subtle racism (and the not-so-subtle sort), the fear of a funny name, the \"inexperience\" meme were all a factor, but when it came down to it these once-proud foot soldiers of the Republican party were disgusted, defeated and disaffected by their own side. Once they canvassed neighbourhoods and raised money for the GOP. Now they were unconvinced that McCain shared their values and bitter about the mess the Bush administration has made of things. </p> <p>The evangelicals were disgusted with his lukewarm position on abortion (not to mention furious that in eight years, with a friendly legislature for most of them, Bush had not yet overturned Roe v Wade or stopped gay marriage). The fiscal conservatives were furious at the ruinous state of the economy and our massive foreign debt (though most had profited handily from the last several years), and while they favoured McCain on paper, they were unconvinced his nebulous economic policies were the right pill for the time. The more hawkish conservatives were pleased with McCain's support for the various wars, but were disgusted by his <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=4652517\">failure to back the new GI Bill</a>. Ideological conservatives \u2013 the darn-close-to-Libertarian crowd \u2013 had long ago jumped ship from the Republicans after the Fisa and Patriot Act issues.</p> <p>While grumbling, griping and complaining bitterly as they grilled their hotdogs, hamburgers and chicken, it seemed as if the final nail in the coffin of their dream of a permanent Republican majority had been set: news that arch-conservative <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/07/usa\">Jesse Helms</a>, longtime senator from North Carolina internationally famous for his right-wing principals, friendships with fascist dictators and his unapologetic resistance to Civil Rights laws, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/04/usa\">finally died</a>. Helms was iconic to North Carolinians, a testament to stubborn adherence to tradition and values. You may have hated him or loved him, but when Helms died, an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/08/usa.race\">era ended for Republicans</a> in this state. </p> <p>For some, it heralded the coming tsunami of left-wing politics about to overwhelm them. For some, it meant that it might be OK \u2013 finally \u2013 to support a black man for elective office. And for some, it was just another reason to hate their own party and what it has become. Helms was a champion of the right wing, an adept politician who not only espoused conservative principals, but passed bills that had brought real prosperity back to his home state. He had dominated politics here for three decades. He was a true God-fearing conservative, no \"neo\" about him. Compared to Helms, McCain looks like Hillary Clinton. Helms's reign represented the high-water mark for conservatives in the south. Under Helms, the GOP was eating steak at the beach. Now they're grilling hotdogs at home.</p>",

No one had been able to contact the activists by this evening. The British embassy has requested immediate consular access.</p> <p>In a separate incident, a European activist arranged the screening of a film about Tibetan views of the Olympics in Beijing. The event was halted when his hotel asked reporters to leave, but public security officials waiting at the venue did not intervene directly.</p> <p>The Tibet issue has dogged the Olympics since March's violent riots in Lhasa and wider protests across Tibetan areas led to a security clampdown. Activists responded with demonstrations along the international leg of the torch relay, in turn sparking anger among the Chinese. </p> <p>Other protests today included a demonstration by three Americans who loudly denounced China's population control policies in Tiananmen Square after the torch had passed through. Police allowed them to leave the area after questioning them briefly.</p> <p>Journalists also received messages summoning them to two hotel rooms in Beijing containing dummies splattered with red paint. The walls had been defaced with slogans, including: \"One World, Our Nightmare\" - a play on the Olympic \"One World, One Dream\" message - and a list of jailed dissidents. It was not clear who had carried out the protest.</p> <p>The US swimmer Amanda Beard, an Athens 2004 gold medallist, unveiled an anti-fur advert outside the Olympic village after the authorities prevented her from staging a news conference in a hotel for \"safety\" reasons.</p> <p>The government has designated zones for protest in parks around the city, but human rights campaigners warn that Chinese citizens will be deterred from taking part by the fear of reprisals, and several groups have already been denied permits.</p> <p>Other activists have been unable to enter the country. Team Darfur, a coalition of athletes seeking to draw attention to the conflict in Sudan, said that Beijing yesterday revoked the visa of its co-founder, the Olympic gold medallist Joey Cheek.</p> <p>Emmanuelle Moreau, an International Olympic Committee spokeswoman, said organisers should expect people to use the platform of the Olympics to draw attention to their causes.</p> <p>She said: \"The IOC are confident Beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding.\"</p>",
  "<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.ips.gov.uk/passport/press-2006-07-24.asp\">Identity and Passport Service</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are determined that the British passport will remain one of the most secure in the world, and a document that can be relied on by British travellers wherever they go.</p> </blockquote> <p>How can we reconcile that with the story in the Times today with the headline <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4467106.ece\">\"Fakeproof\" e-passport is cloned in minutes</a>? Or with other reports when NO2ID demonstrated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/idcards/story/0,,1950226,00.html\">with the Guardian</a> that scanners built in hours from cheap components bought off the internet can pick up, translate and copy the contents of an e-passport and, for <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=440069&amp;in_page_id=1770\">the Daily Mail</a>, how the encryption can be cracked and the data read from an e-passport \u2013 without even opening the envelope in which it leaves the Passport Office? </p> <p>Why does anyone still maintain the things are secure? Why should we want our identities verified by them, or the same techniques embodied in the Home Office's beloved ID cards?</p> <p>It depends what you mean by \"secure\". The IPS's concept of security is net security of the state. Its concept of identity is that it knows who you are and can tell its friends. The document should be separate from the person. But the Home Office model of personal identity is that the infallible file determines the person, and the official document is a magic fragment of the file.</p> <p>The e-passport standard was pushed through the International Civil Aviation Organisation in the first part of this decade. It was largely devised by the US and UK authorities. New passports of all participating countries are designed to do what they have just been demonstrated to do. The whole point is for the chips to be programmable and that they cough up, on proper-seeming demand, everything about you that's on the passport. It isn't a bug; it's a feature. That information is intended to be captured, copied, stored, transmitted and collated. In e-borders schemes it will be automatically compared with ticket data, no-fly-lists, suspect lists and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/06/theairlineindustry.politics\">other official lists</a> \u2013 in order to, as the UK Border Agency so comfortingly puts it: \"keep a comprehensive record of everyone who crosses our border\". The same motivation is at work as with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/23/uksecurity.terrorismandtravel\">passenger name record data-sharing</a>.</p> <p>A biometric passport designed with the security of the document and the holder uppermost in mind would use the same technology but in a very different way. A digital signature can verify the document without any requirement to take data from it. If there's a biometric template encoded on the document, then in principle it can be verified at the point of checking as matching the person and their passport or visa \u2013 without the information being recorded or passed elsewhere. Just as the human immigration officer doesn't need to copy your passport photo in order to check it looks enough like you, neither does an electronic one matching your fingerprints. Doing it that way would be cheaper, much more private from the traveller's point of view, and less easy to cheat than a combination of massive databases of travel movements and personal details squirted everywhere. It doesn't even need the IPS to have a database of passport holders \u2013 though one for lost passports would be unexceptionable.</p> <p>If you must have a watchlist then that can work the same way. Does this name/picture on the separately verified document match the list? If no, do nothing \u2013 no information need be kept \u2013 if yes, perform more checks.</p> <p>The trouble is not technology. It is not expense. It is that world officialdom would much rather track us all around, so that if the detail of our movements might be useful to someone in authority one day, it will have been secured.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 2004, it wasn't just presidential platforms that voters were buzzing about. A sweeping number of conservative ballot initiatives that Karl Rovians hoped would draw conservative and evangelical voters to the polls also had pundits and pollsters chattering. You might remember the \"values voters\". They were the mythical independent voters wooed by those who hoped that values might be defined as discriminating against gay men and lesbians, immigrants and equal opportunity. And the Democrats <a href=\"http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=weddingbell_blues\">fell down</a> on these ballot initiatives, panicked about pointing out the obvious discriminatory nature of the measures, hoping they would go away on their own.</p> <p>In the first flush of recriminations after the elections, values voters were blamed for John Kerry's loss. Democrats wrung their hands about gay marriage in Massachusetts having had a negative impact on their Election Day results, when what was really needed was a hard, introspective look at what these ballot initiatives meant for the Democratic party, and for America.</p> <p>Lately there's been little talk about these values, those voters and that kind of conservative election tactic. But the ballot initiatives? <a href=\"http://www.ballot.org/vertical/Sites/%7B26C6ABED-7A22-4B17-A84A-CB72F7D15E3F%7D/uploads/%7B7975768F-3116-4FBA-A32F-00D85059253E%7D.PDF\">They fester on</a> (pdf). Across the country, states are circulating petitions \u2013 and in some cases have already ensured the place of \u2013 a series of \u00fcber-conservative ballot questions that range from restricting abortion access to taking away rights from non-married (read: aimed at gay) couples to affirmative action.</p> <p>Start in Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee John McCain's own state. Last week McCain reversed his earlier position on an anti-affirmative action ballot initiative \u2013 wolf-in-sheep's clothing like called the \"Arizona Civil Rights Initiative\" \u2013 telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/07/mccain-reverses.html\">\"I support it\"</a>, even though just a few years ago he rejected a similarly worded measure as \"divisive\".</p> <p>Voters will be asked to agree with McCain on the following statement: \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, colour, ethnicity or national origin, in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting.\" (Bankrolled by Ward Connelly, a similarly worded initiative will appear in Nebraska and Missouri).</p> <p>Arizona has some other fun ones currently circulating, including one that would ban the issuance of <a href=\"http://www.law.arizona.edu/news/Press/Silverman120707.pdf\">birth certificates</a> (pdf) to children born to undocumented workers. In that same vein, Oregon and Missouri have put English-only measures up for a vote. Oregon would ban the teaching of foreign languages in ESL courses for the next two years (meaning a forced English immersion to foreign students - a tactic that hasn't worked elsewhere). <a href=\"http://www.proenglish.org/states/missouri.htm\">Missouri</a> would ensure that no language other than English was spoken at public meetings regarding public legal issues.</p> <p>Harkening back to the battles of 2004, Arizona also has a Defence of Marriage Act (Doma) referred to the ballot. That anti-gay measure joins California's Doma, Florida's so-called \"super Doma\" and Arkansas' effort to prevent any non-married persons from adopting children. Each of these so-called marriage protecting amendments \u2013 sweeping measures structured by homophobia and the hopes of undermining the rights of gay men and lesbians \u2013 should be a concern to <em>all</em> Americans. If the mere discriminatory nature of these efforts \u2013 to strip domestic partnership benefits, adoption rights and other simple legal pleasures enjoyed by heterosexual partnerships \u2013 aren't enough to galvanise the general population to action, there are plenty of reasons unmarried heterosexuals might want to take notice as well.</p> <p>Ultimately, in their aggressive march to undermine the rights of fellow Americans, these measures end up discriminating against all unmarried people. When Ohio passed its anti-gay marriage amendment in 2004, the state inadvertently undermined the ability of unmarried individuals to sue for domestic abuse violations. If you weren't married, you weren't being battered. Surely that lesson alone should be enough to shake even those voters apathetic about gay rights. </p> <p>The perennial conservative effort to restrict abortion access continues through ballot initiatives as well. South Dakota - the state known for multiple attempts to single-handedly overturn Roe v Wade, including a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/19/AR2008071901586.html\">measure</a> that went into effect in mid July that requires doctors to tell prospective abortion candidates that the procedure \"will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique living human being\" - will be voting on a ballot initiative that would ban all abortions except in cases of rape or incest. California has proposed a controversial <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PIMA.pdf\">parental notification law</a> (pdf) even though <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/06/national/06abortion.html\">studies</a> have shown that such laws have not measurably lowered abortion rates. (In fact, a 2006 New York Times study found that, counter-intuitively, sometimes it was parents that pushed for the abortion).</p> <p>Finally Colorado has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/12/AR2008071201615.html\">\"definition of personhood\"</a> proposal on the ballot that would declare \"fertilisation\" as the moment that life begins. That means fertilised eggs will have the same rights as people \u2013 a definition that carries complications far beyond the abortion debate. The fertility industry, for one, often if not always, fertilises many more eggs than an infertile couple will implant in the hopes of childbearing. If Colorado has its way, those zygotes will have the same rights as people. The proposed law would also have an impact on the use of IUDs and the morning after pill (which prevent implantation rather than fertilisation), as well as some birth control pills. And it will potentially implicate a woman who miscarries or engages in any behaviour that might be deemed harmful (smoking or drinking or using drugs) while pregnant, an issue that has already become a hot issue <a href=\"http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org\">in other states</a>.</p> <p>The big question for conservatives and liberals alike is what impact these initiatives will have on the race for the White House. Affirmative action, abortion and anti-gay measures can serve as <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/07/30/whats-coming-your-ballot-this-fall\">wedge issues</a>, painting a candidate in one direction or another, and thus woo a crucial several thousand votes. In 2006, stem cells did exactly that, in the tight Senate race between <a href=\"http://www.stateline.org/live/details/story?contentId=146780\">Claire McCaskill and Jim Talent in Missouri</a>, giving the margin of error to McCaskill, the Democrat. But all too often progressives are on the losing side the ballot initiative gamble.</p> <p>Currently, the conventional wisdom is the blowback from this year's ballot initiatives will be <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/no_20080725_2366.php\"> minimal</a> - but that dismissal comes with caveats. Engaging in debate sparked by these ideologically slanted ticket-fillers is a losing proposition for any candidate, embroiling them in dirty, overly specific, no-win battles fiercely defended by highly partisan splinter groups that can only damage the general reputation of the politician.</p> <p>For those ballot initiatives that are already set for November in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Colorado, the hope is that the sticky space will be <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-ballot29-2008jul29,0,845120.story\">shared by McCain</a> who will have to take politically impossible positions (the \"personhood\" measure, for one, has divided conservatives, and flip-flopping on affirmative action only hurts). But for those measures still in the petition stage, Democrats should work while they can to keep them from ever hitting the ballot, fighting them on their dubious constitutionality and their distasteful, and anti-American, discriminatory messages.</p>",

The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains by Owen Wister </h2> <p>In the 1880s a weedy Easterner named Owen Wister had something like a nervous breakdown. Wyoming, with its wide-open spaces and healthy pursuits, was prescribed as a cure. Wister was immediately smitten by the taciturn cowboys and the rules imposed upon them by the cattle barons. Collecting his notes he produced the novel that is the western's sine qua non. It was Gary Cooper, I think, who first spoke the immortal line on camera: \"When you call me that, smile!\" Researching for my own book I came upon the Occidental Hotel in Buffalo, Wyoming, where I was shown the very room in which Wister composed a part of his masterpiece. Some claim it was the very room whither the Virginian repaired to claim his Molly after his climactic shoot-out with Trampas. A good corrective to Wister's world view - in which the cattle barons (the \"quality\") were born justified - is Michael Cimino's unfairly vilified Heaven's Gate. </p> <h2>2. The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald</h2> <p>Although set on the eastern seaboard the story it tells, as its narrator himself observes, is really about the West. But that admission is not the primary reason for Scott Fitzgerald's novel to be invited into the Western Hall of Fame; no, it has more to do with the metamorphosis of Jimmy Gatz into Jay Gatsby. The process begins in childhood (evidenced by a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy, into which Gatsby-to-be had inscribed a strict daily timetable, and a list of general resolves), and concludes when he meets a mentor surnamed Cody. The name of course is a signal. It broadcasts that Jay Gatsby reborn is a part of that line of self-made westerners that begins with the scout whose exploits reenacted thrilled the Crowned Heads of Europe; none other than Buffalo Bill Cody. On top of all that is the fact that the book concludes with the necessary shoot-out. </p> <h2>3. The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones by Charles Neider </h2> <p>The title is a variation upon the one devised by Pat Garrett to tell the story of his dance of death with Billy the Kid. As well as changing the name of the protagonist, Neider altered the location from New Mexico to California. Hendry's tale is narrated by an old compadre named Doc Baker, whose laconic voice persuades the reader that his descriptions of deed and landscape are indeed as authentic as promised. To add conviction, Neider rode for days on end through the canyons of California, wore a Colt .45 on his hip, and practised drawing the gun until his fingers bled. Marlon Brando wasn't quite so bothered when he purchased the movie rights, changed the title to One-Eyed Jacks, and sacked Doc Baker. He took to wearing his pistol in a cummerbund. \"What's your opinion of that?\" Neider was asked. \"First time he'd draw that gun he'd blow his balls off,\" he replied. Sam Peckinpah was the original screenwriter on the project. He called Neider \"Master\" and picked his brains. If you ask me, his subsequent version of the story owes a lot to Neider the Master.</p> <h2>4. True Grit by Charles Portis </h2> <p>One-eyed Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn is the role that finally delivered John Wayne his Oscar. But this is where the character began. Young Mattie Ross (aged 14), a girl blessed with precocious and ferocious pedantry, leaves her farm in Arkansas to avenge the murder of her father at the hands of a man named Chaney (a prescient touch that), and en route meets his one-eyed nemesis. But Portis spares neither Chaney nor Cogburn. Instead of riding off into the sunset, only to reappear in a sequel, Cogburn suffers a miserable decline (which includes taking the wrong side in the Johnson County War, provoked by Wister's impeccable cattlemen), and finally dies while employed as an actor in a Wild West show run by Cole Younger and Frank James, who have matured from murderous outlaws into old hams.</p> <h2>5. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford by Ron Hansen</h2> <p>Frank James reappears in this novel, of course, but his younger brother is its guiding light. Hansen tells a familiar story, but uses prose which is vibrant and original, which constantly magicks nouns and adjectives into verbs, into words of action, as if its hero had some direct line to the logos. This religious undercurrent finds further expression in the relationship between Jesse James and his killer, which echoes that between Christ and his red-headed betrayer. Equally scintillating is Hansen's companion volume Desperadoes, which tells the story of those lesser Kansas outlaws, the Dalton Gang.</p> <h2>6. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy</h2> <p>McCarthy's prose in Blood Meridian comes blazing from the Book of Revelation. Told through the eyes of a young runaway this blood-soaked and blood-crazed novel details the death, destruction and disease doled out by four dozen horsemen of the apocalypse as they traverse America's southern borderline. Their leader, the Judge. is Manifest Destiny personified, in all its compulsive and repulsive glory. An altogether cooler and less febrile version of America's Westward expansion may be found in Blood and Thunder, a popular history by Hampton Sides.</p> <h2>7. Close Range &amp; Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 1 &amp; 2 by Annie Proulx </h2> <p>First, there were the dinosaurs whose bones sleep in Wyoming's bedrock. Next came the mammals: the elk, the moose, the bison and the wolf. Co-existing with them (though not necessarily with each other) were the Cheyenne, the Crow, and the Sioux. Then came the ranchers and the oilmen, And finally came Annie Proulx, who describes the sorry state to which all have fallen with prose that is beady-eyed, lyrical. cold-blooded, and with a hell of a bite.</p> <h2>8. Stories from Mesa Country by Jane Candia Coleman</h2> <p>As Annie Proulx is to Wyoming, so is Jane Candia Coleman to Arizona. Her prose is as pared down as the land she inhabits. But there is stark beauty in it too. Mesa Country, as described by Coleman, is a merciless place, but amid the death and disappointment are rare moments of compassion and conjuncture, as when an outlaw on the run finds strange (though brief) comfort in the home of a lonely woman. Coleman's book is divided between Then &amp; Now: Then being the 1880s, when Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday made a fearsome duo in Tombstone. It is no coincidence that Coleman is married to the historian Glenn G Boyer, whose expertise on Earp et al is beyond compare.</p> <h2>9. Snow Mountain Passage by James D Houston</h2> <p>For a couple of years James D Houston was my near-neighbour in Santa Cruz. The house in which he lived had once belonged to Patty Reed, who as a young girl had been a member of the infamous Donner Party, that band of unfortunate emigrants who had been trapped by winter in the Sierras. Beginning in 1920, with Patty Reed (by then 82) sitting on her porch and contemplating the Pacific's eternal ebb and flow, Houston's novel goes on to recount the Donner Party's ghastly journey from her point of view. Somehow Houston manages to make real not only the stoical calm of an old woman looking back, but also the untested sensibility of an eight-year-old, open to wild adventure and incredible privation (that ended in cannibalism). </p> <h2>10. Crazy Horse by Larry McMurtry</h2> <p>Perhaps I should have picked Lonesome Dove or even The Last Picture Show, but I felt there should be at least one book about the Sioux or the Apache on this list. And since so little is known about Crazy Horse this biography is of necessity speculation if not actual fiction. Nevertheless, McMurtry presents a convincing and sympathetic portrait of one of the most enigmatic figures of the Wild West: never photographed or drawn, never quoted verbatim, and now resting in an unknown grave, Crazy Horse flits through history like a ghost, forever an absent presence, like all our pasts.</p>",
  "<p>A woman from Morocco, has lived in France for eight years with a French husband, has three French children and speaks fluent French, was refused citizenship recently on grounds of being insufficiently assimilated. The <a href=\"http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0820.shtml\">conseil d'etat said</a> Faiza Silmi's way of life does not reflect \"French values\", particularly the goal of gender equality. The judgment claims she lives in \"total submission\" to the men in her life because she wears the niqab, which covers all of the face except the eyes. The decision was approved by commentators from right, left and centre. Fadela Amara, the urban affairs minister, called Silmi's clothing a \"prison\" and a \"straitjacket\". Predictable debates about fundamentalism unfolded in the media, with Silmi appearing as a strange, distant object.</p> <p>What does Silmi herself say? The website <a href=\"http://www.jeuneafrique.com/\">Jeuneafrique.com</a> has just published her first interview with the French press, corroborating another in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/19/world/europe/19france.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=66a2d7d1e26a3089&amp;ex=1216612800&amp;exprod=myyahoo&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">New York Times</a>. Silmi's voice emerges clearly:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am not submissive to the men in my family nor do I lead the life of a recluse and I go out when I want. When I drive my car, I wear my niqab. I alone decided to wear it, after reading some books. I respect the law and my husband respects my decisions.</p> </blockquote> <p>While she talked, her husband served tea.</p> <p>There is no universally accepted definition of gender equality. <a href=\"http://www.niputesnisoumises.com/actualite.php?numactu=196\">For some</a>, the simple act of wearing a veil proves Silmi is oppressed. Others see her as having made choices, adapted, evolved. Silmi does not proselytise about religion or gender, but she does not like men staring at her in the street. While some observers interpret her adoption of more traditional clothes than she wore in Morocco as a sign of regression, Silmi demonstrates a typical migrant desire to validate the past while finding her way in a new life. This is a process and she may well change her style again in years to come. </p> <p>Candidates on dating sites like <a href=\"http://www.muslima.com/French/default.cfm\">Muslima.com</a> reveal an array of headgear. Some describe themselves as modest, long considered a positive trait. Are we now meant to believe that bare arms, face, calves, midriffs and cleavage are not simply fashion but a progressive state of dress? Societies teem with differing ideas about what kinds of clothing denotes modesty, liberation, oppression, equality, sexiness and beauty. One wonders whether the social workers and judges in Silmi's case believe no one influences their own clothing choices.</p> <p>Western societies like to think they are at the forefront of a cultural timeline that applies in the same way to all cultures. A neocolonialist predisposition to see migrant women as oppressed and backward becomes inevitable but, logically, if Silmi is insufficiently evolved then many women born in Europe also do not deserve their citizenship: those who stay with violent partners, perhaps, or who fail to work outside the home. </p> <p>Many countries require longtime foreign residents to pass language and culture tests before being allowed to naturalise. It would be nice to avoid judgments based on the most superficial and cliched of markers: how women look. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_53.htm\">Manhattan Institute</a> has produced an assimilation index comparing the census data of different migrant groups with the established US population. The measures are economic (jobs, education, home ownership), cultural (language, marriage, childbearing) and civic (naturalisation, military service). Most groups do better by one measure than others. In this scheme, Silmi's desire \u2013 and two attempts \u2013 to become French would count as indicating more assimilation. </p> <p>Instead, she and her husband feel alienated and rejected. What exactly did France gain with that result?</p>",
  "<p>California's legislators have been <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D61531F93AA25754C0A964958260\">bickering over a budget</a> for months now. The budget was supposed to be signed in July. As happens almost every year, come August there is <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/04/BA2212523E.DTL&amp;tsp=1\">still no budget</a>.</p> <p>Partly that's because Democrats and Republicans in the statehouse can't agree on whether to raise taxes or cut services, and at times it appears the party leaders are <a href=\"http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/Schwarzenegger_Sinks_to_New_Low_5937.html\">more interested in embarrassing their opponents</a> than in hashing out coherent financial decisions. California is one of only a few states that insist a budget be passed by a two-thirds vote by legislators in both houses, thus allowing a small group of legislators to exercise veto power of the budget. Partly it's to do with the fact that the state's finances are chronically out of whack, with legislators hobbled by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)\">series of ballot initiatives</a> passed over the previous 30 years that have had the effect of limiting local and state tax bases. In essence, California's voters want services, but they are notoriously reluctant to release the tax dollars that make these services possible.</p> <p>This year, however, the impasse has been made more urgent by the dire condition of the national economy and the trickle-down effect this has had on state government. A few months ago, California's analysts believed the state was looking at a deficit of a few billion dollars, a manageable, if unpleasant, phenomenon for a state with an annual budget of over $100bn. But as the economy has hit the skids, the problems have grown exponentially worse. Now that deficit is thought to be nearer $15bn, with some predicting it could rise to $20bn.</p> <p>Put simply, it means that about one in every five dollars spent by the state is now money it doesn't have. Given California is already spending about 7% of its budget servicing its existing debt - a legacy of the above-mentioned reluctance to countenance adequate tax levels - that's more than merely a nuisance. If governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is to be believed, it threatens to utterly derail state finances. A numbers of reports have labelled this California's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Now, clearly a $15bn hole is a large problem. Yet it's hardly unique. Over the past year, the financial meltdown precipitated by the sub-prime mortgage crisis has led to \"writedowns\" in the private sector at least equal in size to California's budget-gap. Merrill Lynch, Citibank, Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2026 the list of financial companies that have had to eat multibillion-dollar losses goes on. In the broader economy, Detroit's auto giants have also absorbed staggering losses. </p> <p>Moreover, in its increasingly desperate attempts to stop the wheels coming off the whole system, over the past year the federal government has eaten hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, bailing out Bear Stearns, stepping in to shore up Fannie Mae, releasing $100bn in emergency tax cuts to individuals, guaranteeing the money owed to customers in failed banks such as the recently-deceased IndyMac. Recently, Congress passed the biggest housing bill in decades, committing the feds to bail out hundreds of thousands of homeowners at risk of seeing their homes go into foreclosure. At a state government level, New York is also facing a multibillion-dollar revenue shortfall, albeit one considerably smaller than that of California's.</p> <p>This can be interpreted in one of two ways. Either California's crisis is not quite as bad as the governor and others have portrayed it, since everybody and their uncle is now rolling around in losses that involve numbers ending in 10 or 11 zeroes. Or the banking and government crisis is really, really bad, with private banks, mortgage companies and investment firms taking hits that are big enough to knock the largest and wealthiest state in America off stride - and with local, state and federal governments sliding into levels of indebtedness that will likely prove utterly ruinous over the long run.</p> <p>Pessimist that I am, I increasingly tend toward the latter interpretation. After all, California isn't play-acting at being in trouble. It really is in a miserable situation. The $15bn deficit has led to t<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/the_state_worker/\">ens of thousands of state employees being laid off</a> (initial estimates were that over 20,000 would lose their jobs, but that number was subsequently reduced to slightly over 10,000), the paring down of government services, Schwarzenegger's order last week to place <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-budget24-2008jul24,0,2620443.story\">200,000 state employees on the federal minimum wage</a> come September should legislators not swallow their differences and negotiate a budget, escalating costs of borrowing on the bond market, the decimation of state-funded medical and social services for the poor and elderly and a massive contraction of state aid to already-overstretched local governments.</p> <p>The risk is that a downward spiral has started, one that comes complete with its own feedback loops. As house values slide, a declining property tax base is leading to cuts in local services. These cuts push regional economies further into recession, thus magnifying conditions triggered by the national slowdown. This, in turn, lowers the state's ability to raise money through taxes, which leads to further reductions in jobs and services, which leads to less money flowing through the whole system and a gradual erosion of private-sector purchasing power.</p> <p>In the same way as global warming begets more warming \u2013 liquid water absorbs heat, for example, while ice caps reflect it; hotter climates lead to more use of air conditioning units, which pushes yet more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere \u2013 so the current recession, anchored as it is by high energy prices, increased competition for scarce natural resources and declining liquidity in global credit markets risks begetting more recession. Private sector slowdowns cascade into government crises, and the faltering government expenditures then spill back over into the private sector. </p> <p>The conditions are in place for a great unravelling of the borrowing-based mass consumption culture. It's tempting to engage in a bit of schadenfreude, an \"I told you so\" gloating about how a culture that wants everything yet isn't willing to tax itself adequately in order to pay for it is simply getting its comeuppance. The problem is the people getting hammered by this unravelling are the poorest and most vulnerable populations. </p> <p>There's nothing remotely satisfying in seeing California close community health clinics, reduce library hours or put hundreds of thousands of workers onto minimum wage. Yet it is, I fear, a harbinger of years of hard times still to come.</p>",
  "<p>The race to carve up the Arctic for its oil, gas and mineral reserves has been charted for the first time in an attempt to alert international policy makers to serious territorial disputes that could result.</p> <p> A <a href=\"http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/arctic.pdf\">new map (pdf)</a> is designed to illustrate historical, ongoing and potential arguments about ownership in the competition to control areas rich in natural resources. </p> <p>Its publication by Durham University researchers comes as a growing number of states including the UK cast their eyes towards polar regions and big slices of the ocean floors. </p> <p>Countries must establish sovereignty over disputed territories if they are to exploit their undiscovered, technologically recoverable energy reserves. </p> <p>The attempts to assert such rights have already alarmed conservationists who want better international protection for the poles as climate change melts the ice and opens up more land and seabeds for exploration.</p> <p>Last year, a Russian submarine planted a flag on the seabed below the North Pole to highlight its claim to a big chunk of the Arctic. Other disputes could involve Canada, US , Denmark (through Greenland), Iceland and Norway.</p> <p>The Arctic map has been prepared by Durham's International Boundaries Research Unit. </p> <p>Its director, Martin Pratt, said a survey by the US Geological Survey estimated that a fifth of the so-far undiscovered but recoverable resources lay within the Arctic Circle. \"We are talking 90 million barrels of oil, nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet. I cannot even imagine how much that is, but it is a lot. I suppose for any state, control is significant as other resources dwindle.\"</p> <p>Pratt said the map was an attempt \"to collate information and predict the way in which the Arctic region may eventually be divided up. The freezing land and seas of the Arctic are likely to be getting hotter in terms of geopolitics.\" There was likely to be increasing concern over damage to the \"unique environment\" of the Arctic. </p> <p>\"It is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity.\"<br> Russia first made a submission about the areas to the UN over the area in 2001. Claims are made under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Coastal states can extend their rights beyond the 200-mile limit from their shoreline if there is a continental shelf. </p> <p>Russia claims its continental shelf extends along a mountain chain under the Arctic called the Lomonosov Ridge. Its flag-waving last year was part of its determination to provide more weight to the claim, which have to be verified by geological and sub-sea surveys.<br>The US has yet to even sign up to the UN convention</p>",
  "<p>A Mexican man at the centre of an international legal dispute has been executed in Texas for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in 1993.</p> <p>While protestors both for and against the death penalty demonstrated outside the Huntsville Unit near Houston last night, Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn, 33, died after being given a lethal injection. </p> <p>The execution came just before 10pm shortly after the US supreme court denied a last request for a reprieve. </p> <p>Pleas for a stay came from Washington, Mexico and the international court of justice (ICJ). </p> <p>They had all urged Texas not to execute Medell\u00edn until a hearing had been held to determine whether or not his original trial was sound.</p> <p>The state's Republican governor, Rick Perry, rebutted attempts to delay off the execution arguing that the state's courts were not bound by the rulings of the ICJ. </p> <p>The ICJ in the Hague had ordered Medell\u00edn's case and those of 50 other Mexicans on death row be reviewed because none had been informed of their right to consular assistance.</p> <p>The US state department said it was powerless to delay the execution, noting that the country's supreme court had ruled in March that president Bush did not have the authority to intervene in the case. </p> <p>The Mexican government has now sent a note of protest to the US state department, expressing \"its concern for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.\" <br> Medell\u00edn and five other teenage boys in his Houston street gang took part in the rape and murder of two girls, Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14, in 1993. </p> <p>Medell\u00edn, who was born in Mexico but moved to the US as a child, was convicted of Pena's murder and has never contested the conviction. <br>Two other members of the gang were also sentenced to die. Two had their sentences commuted to life in prison. The sixth, Medell\u00edn's brother, Vernacio, is serving a 40-year sentence. </p> <p>Medell\u00edn's case has become the focal point of the dispute between Mexico, which does not have the death penalty, and the US over whether or not some Mexicans on death row were denied fair trials because of the lack of consular access.</p> <p>The 1963 Vienna Convention, which both Mexico and the US signed, requires foreigners accused of crimes to be given that opportunity. </p> <p>Over the last five days, Medell\u00edn's lawyers tried to stop the execution by arguing to the Supreme Court that it should be put off until Congress had a chance to pass pending legislation that would require a review of similar cases. </p> <p>They argued that Medell\u00edn would be deprived of life without due process if he died before Congress acted.<br> But the court decided 5-4 that the possibility of congressional action was too remote to justify a stay. </p> <p>One member of the supreme court, justice Stephen Breyer wrote however, that to permit the execution would place the US \"irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises.\" </p> <p>Mexico, which opposes the death penalty, has used the Vienna convention on consular relations to try to block the executions of Medell\u00edn and 50 other Mexicans in the US. </p> <p>Twice in the last five years, the ICJ has said hearings should be held to determine if the 51 trials were fair. </p>",
  "<p><br> Nowhere to hide ... Abi Roberts and Lisa Marks on stage after the screening of Beached</p> <p>I don't think I've ever been so nervous as I was at precisely 6.55pm last Saturday evening. Abi and I were huddled behind the projectionist's door of the screening room at the <a href=\"http://www.afi.com/default.aspx\">American Film Institute</a> in <a href=\"http://z.about.com/d/golosangeles/1/5/1/E/-/-/KMD99LA1-22HollywoodSignClosex.jpg\">Hollywood,</a> watching the 75-seater auditorium we'd hired filling up with people we barely knew.</p> <p>Apart from my boyfriend and a couple of friends, I knew precisely none of the 45-strong audience, who were all there to see <a href=\"http://www.beachedthemovie.com/\">Beached</a>. It was a perfect day in California (the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-la-quake30-2008jul30,0,6284507.story\">5.4 earthquake</a> already a distant memory), most sane people were out sunning themselves and yet - and yet - we had somehow conjured up an audience. I was amazed. We were amazed.</p> <p>Who were these people? How did they find us? In a moment of lucidity we'd printed out an attendance sheet for people to sign, which I'm looking at now. It seems that we were joined by Bafta and AFI members, actors, writers, directors, set PAs, sound editors and a couple of journalists. Plus of course, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/film/2008/03/la_diary_being_bette_midler_in_vegas_baby.html\">our faithful crew</a>.</p> <p>A friend of Abi's, an actor called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1467856/\">Barber Ali</a>, a Brit (of course), who's now working over here (most recently in the TV show Numbers), acted as host. He shepherded people in and did a little comedy intro to the film, which he accidentally called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094715/\">Beaches</a>. Oh, the mirth. It broke the ice and got people into the right mindset for a comedy.</p> <p>Abi and I meanwhile were sitting in the back row clutching each other's hands, and checking each other's makeup for the Q&amp;A afterwards. My stomach was tighter than <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104257/\">a script by Aaron Sorkin</a>. A million crazy thoughts swirl around your mind at that point. Mostly, \"Suppose nobody laughs?\" Really, it's quite the most horrible feeling in the world.</p> <p>Fortunately, and without boring you with the minutiae of precisely where everybody laughed, and how loud (yes, it was all noted), the audience fell about for the first eight minutes, and laughed at the rest of the film but the pacing slowed, showing that the latter half needs some further tightening in edit. On the big screen, there is nowhere to hide.</p> <p>Abi and I have already discussed the snips which our editor Justin and I will work on over the next month or so. I'm my worst critic so I can sit here and go on about everything that was wrong (I did the same after watching <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1092015/\">Maconie's List</a> for the first time with an audience) but there was a lot of good stuff - and more importantly, people laughed. They laughed a lot, and right to the end. We'd also cut a minute-long blooper reel for added value, which was a good move.</p> <p>After the film ended Barber introduced Abi (\"Please welcome the cast!\") and myself on to stage. The Beached logo behind us (created from the sign for the Gold Coast casino in Vegas), we took questions from the audience. They asked about music rights, the budget and what was next for the film. And we didn't even prompt them.</p> <p>We then moved on to a bar in Santa Monica where I drank a couple of cheeky vodkas, tried not to think about the edit changes I wanted to make and mingled with the strangers, a couple of who might just become friends.</p> <p>It was a really lovely way to say thank you to everyone who's done so much work on the movie, and in a great setting too (the AFI is an amazing building in landscaped gardens).</p> <p>And we made <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2007/08/10/laugh460.jpg\">people laugh</a>.

  "<p>With two days to go to the opening ceremony, air quality is becoming an issue in the Olympics.

  "<p>The last survivor of a climbing tragedy on K2 that claimed the lives of 11 people was airlifted off the mountain today.</p> <p>Pakistani officials said Marco Confortola was flown by helicopter from base camp and was on his way to a nearby town. </p> <p>The 37-year-old Italian had been stranded on the world's second-highest peak for nearly five days after a devastating avalanche. Falling ice had blocked the path of climbers descending from the 8,600-metre summit. </p> <p>Among the dead were three Koreans, two Nepalis, two Pakistanis, French, Serbian, and Norwegian climbers and an Irishman earlier listed as missing.</p> <p>Confortola was the last survivor to reach safety. He limped into base camp with frostbitten feet yesterday, but thick clouds forced him to stay an extra night on the mountain.</p> <p>\"I am happy to be alive,\" Confortola told Everest-K2-CNR, an Italy-based high-altitude scientific research group, during a phone call from the mountain's advanced base camp on the Pakistani side.</p> <p>The group's spokeswoman, Francesca Steffanoni, said the mountaineer was examined by an American doctor and reported to be in good condition, despite his blackened toes. </p> <p>\"I am fine, luckily I'm made of stern stuff,\" Confortola said. \"The only problem is that my feet hurt. I spent seven days on that mountain. It was hard. It was terrible.\" </p> <p>He said he would return to Italy \"as soon as possible\" to see a doctor he trusted to treat his feet and lower limbs.</p> <p>Confortola echoed criticism of the expedition voiced by a Dutch climber who was rescued on Monday. The Italian said the expedition was undermined by inexperience and low-quality equipment, including ropes and spikes that easily broke. </p> <p>He revealed the feeling of helplessness he had felt when he and others made a futile attempt to rescue the three Koreans dangling from a rope. He said he had been too weak and had to give up.<br> \"I couldn't take it any more,\" Confortola said. \"The descent was devastating, especially the last part.\"</p> <p>His plight has been front-page news for days in Italy, with constant updates on his progress broadcast on TV. He was escorted part of the way down the mountain by three other climbers. </p> <p>Government officials in Islamabad have promised to investigate the tragedy. Fatal accidents are common on the treacherous peaks that attract top mountaineers to Pakistan each summer, but this is the deadliest single incident in memory, surpassing the deaths of seven climbers on K2 during a fierce storm in 1995.</p> <p>The mountain, which straddles Pakistan and China in the Karakoram range, is regarded by mountaineers as far more challenging than Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. About 280 people have reached the top of K2's since 1954, when it was first summited by Italians Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedell.</p>",

Their protest took place just outside the Bird's Nest, where the opening ceremony will take place on Friday. </p> <p>\"We've done this action today to highlight the Chinese government's use of the Beijing Olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights mobile phone conversation posted on the internet,\" said Iain Thom, one of the protesters, in a recorded mobile phone conversation posted on the internet.</p> <p>The state news agency Xinhua said police ended the protest in 12 minutes, while Students for a Free Tibet said they were there for an hour before security officers led them away peacefully. The group said Thom, 24, was from Scotland while another protester, Lucy Marion, 23, was from England.</p> <p>\"As far as we know foreigners gathered illegally and we express<br>our strong opposition to that. We will resist all attempts to politicise the<br>Olympics,\" said Sun Weide, a spokesman for the Beijing organising committee. \"We have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations, and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of China.\"</p> <p>Sun said the demonstrators had not been arrested or taken to a police station. No one had been able to contact the activists by this afternoon<br>because their phones were off. A British embassy spokesman said it was requesting immediate consular access.</p> <p>In a separate incident, a European activist arranged the screening of a<br>film about Tibetan views of the Olympics in Beijing. It was halted when his hotel asked reporters to leave, but public security officials waiting at the venue did not intervene directly or approach the man when he left the building.</p> <p>The video began with an introduction by Dechen Pemba, a Briton of Tibetan descent deported from the capital last month for \"splittist activities\". At the time, she said she had been in China solely in a private capacity and was not involved in any organisations.</p> <p>The Tibet issue has dogged the Olympics since March's violent riots in<br>Lhasa and wider protests across Tibetan areas led to a security clampdown. Activists responded with demonstrations along the international leg of the torch relay, in turn sparking anger among the Chinese and making them all the keener to focus on celebrations as the flame returned to the capital.</p> <p>Other protests today included a low-key demonstration by three<br>Americans who stood in Tiananmen Square - well after the torch had passed through - to shout a denunciation of China's population control policies. Police allowed them to leave the area after questioning them briefly.</p> <p>Journalists received messages summoning them to two hotel rooms in Beijing containing dummies splattered with red paint. The walls had been defaced with slogans including: \"One World, Our Nightmare\" - a play on the Olympic \"One World, One Dream\" message - and a list of jailed dissidents. It was not clear who carried out the protest.</p> <p>The US swimmer Amanda Beard, an Athens 2004 gold medallist, unveiled an anti-fur advert outside the Olympic village after the authorities prevented her from her staging a news conference in a hotel for \"safety\" reasons.</p> <p>The government has designated zones for protest in parks around the city, but human rights campaigners warn that Chinese citizens will be deterred from taking part by the fear of reprisals and several groups have already been denied permits.</p> <p>Other activists have been unable to enter the country. Team Darfur, a coalition of athletes seeking to draw attention to the conflict in Sudan, said that Beijing yesterday revoked the visa of its co-founder and Olympic gold medallist Joey Cheek.</p> <p>He called the decision \"part of a systemic effort by the Chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of Darfur\".</p> <p>Activists argue China has the greatest leverage of any nation over Khartoum because of its oil purchases from and arms sales to the government. Emmanuelle Moreau, an International Olympic Committee spokeswoman, said organisers should expect people to use the platform of the Olympics to draw attention to their causes.</p> <p>She said: \"The IOC are confident Beijing city authorities will assess the<br>situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ever since Ehud Olmert announced his resignation, there has been speculation about what his status as an outgoing leader will mean for the peace process. Not very much, I suspect, as this lame duck prime minister has done little more than engage in politically expedient dead duck initiatives. </p> <p>Olmert \u2013 who can best be described as a scavenging hawk with a dovish song \u2013 lacks the vision, courage and ideological inclination to take the steps necessary to reach a workable resolution, despite the Annapolis platitudes and its 12-month deadline. </p> <p>At the time, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/19/acivilsolution\">saw the gathering</a> as an \"elaborate way of reiterating the current status quo\". And so it is hardly surprising that some nine months on from Annapolis, the status quo remains unchanged. </p> <p>The only glimmer of hope is on the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article4449488.ece\">Syrian front</a>, where both Olmert and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are making strong peace overtures, but this could easily be derailed by the next elections, especially if <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2393677.stm\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> takes over, or Syria fails to distance itself sufficiently from Tehran.</p> <p>In fact, the fractured and divided nature of the Israeli political landscape is one of the main obstacles to peace because it prevents the government taking the bold steps needed to achieve peace, and enables the hawks to take the doves hostage. </p> <p>Perhaps the most striking example of this uneven contest was the clash in perceptions between Israel's first and second prime ministers David Ben-Gurion (Israel's \"founding father\"), and Moshe Sharett. Although both were committed Zionists, Sharett was in favour of diplomacy and a negotiated settlement with the Arabs.</p> <p>Unlike Ben-Gurion, who knew little about Arab society and culture and distrusted Arabs intensely, Sharett was an accomplished Arabist and had many Arab friends. At a <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/Mapai.html\">Mapai party</a> meeting, he once declared: \"There is a wall between us and [the Arabs] \u2026 If this wall can be prevented from getting taller, it is a sacred duty to do so.\"</p> <p>Sharett's most spectacular attempt to dismantle the \"wall\" was the secret talks he initiated with the new Egyptian regime led by the revolutionary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Officers_Movement\">Free Officers' Movement</a>. Despite his later anti-Israel reputation, Gamal Abdel Nasser saw, at the time, that compromise and accommodation were the only way to resolve the conflict.</p> <p>Before he became president, but as de facto leader of the revolution, Nasser assured Sharett, in a secret correspondence in May 1953, that Egypt harboured no belligerent feeling towards Israel and signalled his willingness to build bridges. </p> <p>Even the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair\">Lavon Affair</a> in 1954 did not weaken his resolve. Nasser decided not to blame Sharett \u2013 who was in fact not aware of the plot \u2013 and agreed to resume the clandestine contacts. Between October 1954 and January 1955, the two men discussed indirectly Israeli-Egyptian relations, border issues, solutions to the Palestinian refugee crisis, Israeli shipping rights and avenues for economic co-operation.</p> <p>Nasser even agreed to high-level secret talks between Egyptian and Israeli diplomats, but Sharett got cold feet due to domestic anger surrounding the trial of the Israeli spies behind the Lavon terror campaign. </p> <p>Alarmed at Sharett's dovish overtures, Ben-Gurion came out of retirement and replaced him as prime minister again in 1955. Almost at once, Ben-Gurion launched a major raid on Gaza, sparking a downward spiral to war and effectively burying prospects for peace for almost a quarter of a century. </p> <p>Had Sharett succeeded and managed to translate his backroom talks into an actual peace that covered all the aspects he and Nasser discussed, the Middle East today could have been a very different place. But he lacked the popular appeal and charisma to counter the populism of his opponents.</p> <p>Militants getting the upper hand over moderates is not just an Israeli malaise. The Palestinians have also suffered their fair share of that. A Palestinian parallel of the Sharett-Ben-Gurion standoff was the confrontation between the mufti and mayor of Jerusalem.</p> <p>Haj Amin el-Husseini, the notorious mufti of Jerusalem, was a complete rejectionist of the Zionist presence in Palestine. While the Palestinians had the right to feel irked that the British had promised their land to another people without consulting them, a realist and humanist would've tried to find an accommodation that would allow Palestinians to realise their national aspirations and enable Jews to flee persecution, either by agreeing to a bi-national state or partition \u2013 both of which were on the cards. In fact, just before the outbreak of the second world war, the British offered the Palestinians a state with an Arab majority within a decade. He rejected that, too. </p> <p>Raghib el-Nashashibi, who was mayor Jerusalem between 1920 and 1934, opposed the unbending and uncompromising stance of Haj Amin. Nashashibi was in favour of a negotiated settlement with the British and the Zionists and, as head of the National Defence Party, he was willing to accept partition so long as the Palestinians got sufficient land and could merge with Transjordan to form a viable political entity.</p> <p>But the mufti, a master populist, managed both to get the upper hand against Nashashibi and other moderates, setting back the Palestinian quest for nationhood, and to tarnish the Palestinian struggle by moving to Europe and collaborating with the Nazis.</p> <p>Again, one cannot help but speculate how different reality would have been had moderates like Nashashibi gained the advantage during the British mandate and managed to find moderate Zionists with whom to reach an accommodation.</p> <p>In order to avoid total despair, it is important to realise that moderates may lose many battles, but they can eventually win the war. After all, a quarter of a century after the Sharett-Nasser talks, Egypt and Israel made peace.</p> <p>Likewise, trailblazers such as Israel's veteran peacenik Uri Avnery and moderate PLO members, such as the late Issam Sartawi, met together in the Israel-Palestine Peace Council in the mid-1970s to discuss a two-state resolution to the conflict. Said Hammami (whose name means pigeon or dove in Arabic), the PLO's London representative, was a vocal advocate of a two-state solution which, he believed, would eventually merge into a single, democratic, multi-ethnic state. Both Sartawi and Hammami paid for their convictions with their lives.</p> <p>Today, hope for the future does not lie with the mainstream players, but with the brave, principled and sensible advocates currently on the political fringe. On the Palestinian side, a strong candidate is Mustafa Barghouti, the founder of the Palestinian National Initiative and the runner-up in the last presidential election. On the Israeli side, there is Adam Keller, the spokesman of the peace group Gush Shalom. More in the mainstream, there are Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabo, two Oslo negotiators who went on to forge the informal <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/geneva03.htm\">Geneva Accord</a>.</p>",

Bowing to the financial and logistic inevitable - that most decent productions are going to be doing the rounds of other UK theatres sooner or later - Mills seems to have no trouble programming material that will also be appearing in other venues.</p> <p>It's certainly evident in the dance programme this year. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jun/12/dance.culture\">Matthew Bourne's Dorian Gray, which is probably the headlining event of 2008</a>, not only has its preview run in Plymouth just the week before Edinburgh but afterwards goes straight on to a two-week run at Sadler's Wells. <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/event/steve-reich-evening.html\">Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker's Steve Reich Evening</a> also comes to the Wells, after just a five-week gap.</p> <p>Batsheva is at the Wells and Riverside Studio during Dance Umbrella (albeit with different material) while Chunky Move were at the Brighton Festival back in May (again, with a different production). Put together, that means that all the main dance events at this year's festival, apart from State Ballet of Georgia and the Whirling Dervishes, will also be having a life south of the border.</p> <p>This is certainly good news for non-Scottish dance fans. Brian McMaster, in his early years at Edinburgh, pulled off some stellar initiatives in his dance programming, presenting seasons from the Martha Graham Company, New York City Ballet and Mark Morris that were not exclusive to the festival but in the case of the first two companies represented their first and only visit to the UK in years. What was great for Edinburgh, however, proved to be very expensive for all those who had to travel hundreds of miles to catch such events.</p> <p>It also meant that some of this \"exclusive\" material wasn't being seen in ideal conditions. One of the reasons why dance has never become a central plank of the EIF - despite McMaster's and Mills's efforts - is that the majority of productions, whatever their scale or style, all get put into the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghplayhouse.org.uk/index.asp?VenueID=93\">grimly cavernous Playhouse</a>, where no other sensible art form would go. This barn of a theatre is a horrible place for viewing dance, swallowing up even the largest spectacles in its gloomy stage and making any event that's less than fully sold out feel like a wet Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>Of course there are the lucky few shows that get elevated to the Festival Theatre (when it's not being used for opera), while the <a href=\"http://www.list.co.uk/article/5971-dance-base-dance-house/\">recently built Dancebase</a> represents an improving of dance venues on the Fringe. But still the Playhouse casts a long shadow. For me, however lively the festival buzz, it's never really done the business. It's not just issues of convenience that make me far happier to see Dorian Gray, Batsheva, de Keersmaeker in a theatre like Sadler's Wells - which is actually designed for dance.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh\">Click here for all our Edinburgh festival 2008 coverage</a></strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>\"When Ian Ashbee takes the armband for Hull City this season, he will have captained the club through all four divisions,\"</strong> writes Sean Cavany. <strong>\"Has any other player achieved this, in England or abroad?\"</strong></p> <p>We've had several suggestions ranging from deepest Wales to the rolling hills of Tuscany. But first to Northampton, where John Briggs highlights a Cobblers icon. \"I believe the late Joe Kiernan captained Northampton Town in all four divisions way back in the 60s,\" writes John. \"I think he captained them in the second and then the first division. Then they were relegated right down year after year into the fourth division with Joe still in charge.\"</p> <p>The Cobblers were in the Fourth Division in 1960-61, the top-flight by 1965-66, and back in the basement by 1969-70. But although Kiernan was at the club between 1963 and 1972, the club historian Frank Grand tells us that he only captained the side for a short time. The full-back Theo Foley spent more time with the armband, captaining the side from the Third Division to the First, but he left the club in 1967 before their descent was complete.</p> <p>Stuart Malcolm writes to suggest \"the captain of the Swansea side who won promotion to the First Division in the early 1980s\" who \"may have also played in the Fourth Division in the 1970s or after their subsequent relegation back down to the basement\". The only player to play for the Swans in both their rise from the Fourth to the First and in their equally rapid return was Nigel Stevenson. The club confirmed that he captained the side during that time, but weren't sure if he did so in each division.</p> <p>The only other contender we can come up with is Dave Beasant, who played for Wimbledon in all four divisions and was memorably captain for their FA Cup success in 1988. But despite captaining the club for <a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2002/11/30680.htm\">four or five years</a>, Gary Peters wore the armband for their 1982-83 promotion season.</p> <p>So Ashbee appears to be a unique case, and even the best of the continent can't match him. Michael Cox points out the case of Fiorentina's Angelo di Livio. \"When Fiorentina were declared bankrupt in 2002, Di Livio was the only player to remain with the club (or join the new club, if you prefer) when they were entered for Serie C2/B,\" writes Michael. \"Fiorentina won the league by a country mile, and were promoted. With a slight reorganisation of the league system in Italy in 2003, a controversial decision placed Fiorentina in Serie B, where they were also promoted at the first opportunity, again with Di Livio as captain. He remained in this role for his final season as a professional, 2004-05, in Serie A. Therefore, Di Livio captained Fiorentina in the fourth, second and first divisions of Italian football.\"</p> <p><strong>PROS IN PUB TEAMS (2)</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/30/1\">Last week</a> we looked at some professional players who turned out for Sunday league sides, and you've been filling the Knowledge inbox with plenty more.</p> <p>Five years after playing his final game for Tottenham, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann turned out for Orange County Blue Star in California in 2003, scoring five goals in eight games, along with three assists, to take his side into the American Premier Development League play-offs. But opposition players were largely unaware they were contending with a World Cup winner: Klinsmann was registered under the pseudonym Jay Goppingen, named after the town of G\u00f6ppingen where he was born. Eventually rumbled by the local press, Klinsmann was asked how his game was holding up. ''It's slower,'' he replied. Thanks to Tyler Green for spotting that one.</p> <p>Staying in the US, but going back two decades, the former Southampton goalkeeper Eric Martin and Manchester United striker Denis Violet played for Swansfield in the Soccer Association of Columbia Men's League. Paul Rivera, formerly of the Long Reach Bumblebees, writes: ''Both had to play out of position. My back is still sore from the free-kick Martin rebounded off me in 1976.''</p> <p>From the US to sunny Sydney, where Ashley Bennett informs us of his twice-a-season battles with former Crystal Palace and Portsmouth midfielder Craig Foster, who now plays for Waverley Old Boys in the Eastern Suburbs Premier League.</p> <p><strong>FAN-TACHE-TIC</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Who was the last player to score for England sporting a proper moustache?\"</strong> asked Derek Corney last week. <strong>\"I think it was Viv Anderson, but a friend of mine is convinced it was Kenny Sansom.\"</strong></p> <p>Well, if there's money riding on it Derek, you're the one in profit. <a href=\"http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_04/Sansom2TMOS_468x708.jpg\">Sansom</a>'s only goal for England came against Finland in October 1984 in a qualifying match for the 1986 World Cup, while <a href=\" http://www.furd.org/pictures/web/Viv%20Anderson/348.jpg\">Anderson</a> scored his second and last England goal against Yugoslavia on November 12 1986. The two are in fact split by another moustachioed scorer, <a href=\" http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40100000/jpg/_40100521_wallace270.jpg\">Danny Wallace</a>, who netted in January 1986. More recently David Beckham, Darius Vassell and Ledley King have hit the target for England while sporting facial furniture, but theirs are more beard-'tache combos, and certainly not what you'd call \"a proper moustache\".</p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"I recall one episode of Jim'll Fix It, where a young lad asked Jim to fix it for him to become a football referee,\"</strong> wrote David Voss in 2004. <strong>\"I can't remember the sides involved, I suspect they were two Sunday league sides. The plucky young fellow had some link with one of the sides, which showed in his refereeing as he sent all of the other side off.\"</strong></p> <p>I'm not sure Oxford United and Arsenal will thank you for referring to them as Sunday league sides, David. We reckon the game in question took place some time after the end of the 1985-86 season. If memory serves correctly, the lad was an Arsenal fan, who had been enraged by his side's 3-0 defeat the old Manor Ground on the last day of the season - a result which ensured Oxford's First Division survival.</p> <p>Oxford were on a bit of a high at the time. They had won the Milk Cup a few weeks earlier, beating QPR 3-0 in the final, and their side in those days contained the likes of Ray Houghton, John Aldridge and the Northern Ireland striker Billy Hamilton. All three were on the scoresheet in that win over Arsenal, who included eight then-current or future internationals.</p> <p>But the young lad retaliated by sending off virtually the entire Oxford team for a series of petty infringements. \"I remember four players forming a wall being sent off for not being 10 yards away from the free-kick,\" he recalls, \"which, naturally, had been awarded for a red-card offence.\"</p> <p>For many more sepia-tinged questions and answers, why not visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can you help?</strong></p> <p>\"In the Gothenburg v Malm\u00f6 game this Saturday, home defender Ragnar Sigurdsson accidentally headbutted Malm\u00f6 goalie Jonas Sandqvist.
