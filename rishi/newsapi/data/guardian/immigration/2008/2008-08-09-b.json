  "<p>Philip Roth and John Updike are the greatest American novelists of their generation, moral chroniclers of their times and still producing distinguished work in their mid-70s. Both are fascinated by the cinema, and they've had many, possibly most, of their books optioned by Hollywood. Few, however, have reached the screen. In Updike's case there's just a long-forgotten version of his first Rabbit Angstrom novel, Rabbit, Run; a TV film bringing together 17 stories about the marriage of a New England family, Too Far to Go (a theatrical version was shown at Cannes but never released here); and The Witches of Eastwick, torn from its historic context and turned into a vehicle for Jack Nicholson.</p> <p>Roth has been slightly better served. Roger Corman made Battle of Blood Island, an hour-length version of an obscure Roth story, in 1960. In the same year another uncollected tale was filmed in the TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents starring a young Sydney Pollack. But basically his filmography consists of a crudely effective adaptation of his satirical novella Goodbye, Columbus (1969), followed in 1972 by a crudely ineffective version of his biggest success, Portnoy's Complaint, both starring Richard Benjamin; a fairly decent TV treatment (on which Roth himself collaborated) of The Ghost Writer (1984); and a serious but disappointing adaptation of his late masterpiece The Human Stain (2003). Now we have a film of his acute 2001 novella, The Dying Animal, directed by the Spanish movie-maker Isabel Coixet from a screenplay by Nicholas Meyer (adaptor of The Human Stain), and its single act of infidelity is to change the title to Elegy.</p> <p>The central character of Elegy is David Kepesh (Ben Kingsley), a professor of literature in his late sixties, living alone in Manhattan, teaching a course on Practical Criticism, and enjoying a certain late local fame for his appearances on public service radio and TV. Kepesh is one of Roth's alter egos (he turns up in several earlier books), and we know him to be a man of strong sexual appetites, measured judgments and subtle tastes. His conduct has been tempered by political correctness and so, warned by the prominent position given to the sexual harassment hotline on the noticeboard outside his university office, he never propositions a beautiful student until the end-of-year party he throws for his class. At that point everyone has their grades and he's no longer in loco parentis. His latest conquest, to whom he becomes lover and mentor, is Consuela (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), the gorgeous daughter of wealthy Cuban exiles living in New Jersey, and their affair is idyllic. Cruz is not quite the voluptuous Latin beauty Roth has in mind, but she's extraordinarily attractive, and Kepesh's fascination with her breasts is for Roth's readers a little joke. In the 1973 Kafkaesque allegory The Breast, Kepesh actually turns into a breast, and at David's end of term party Consuela is particularly drawn to him when she discovers that he owns a letter sent from Kafka to his mistress, Milena. </p> <p>But this isn't a conventional romance between an ageing man and a woman more than 30 years his junior, though its narrative does turn on those customary elements of jealousy, envy and suspicion. Like all Roth's recent work it's about social change in a troubled America; ageing, disease and physical decay; the desire that exceeds the possibilities of sexual performance; and the imminence of death. Consuela's own mortality eventually becomes a crucial, defining issue. Meanwhile David has three sounding boards in his compartmentalised life - his one close male friend, the celebrated womanising poet George O'Hearn (Dennis Hopper); his former pupil and lover of many years, the successful businesswoman Carolyn (Patricia Clarkson); and his 40-year-old son, Kenny (Peter Sarsgaard), a fine arts consultant with his own company in the book, less interestingly a doctor in the film. </p> <p>Though he himself is now imprisoned in a loveless marriage, Kenny regards his father as an egotistical traitor who deserted him and his mother in the mid-Sixties. But David Kepesh, like O'Hearn and Carolyn, is a creature of the Sixties revolution (as are indeed John Updike and Philip Roth), and he's dedicated to defending the liberation that made possible the freedom he has since enjoyed. Halfway through the novella Kepesh provides the reader with what he calls a 'sidelight', an account of Merry Mount, a trading post in early 17th-century New England where anything went by way of sexual licence, miscegenation and devil worship. It was run by Thomas Morton, an English hedonist, and it was a challenge and affront to the nearby Puritans, who tried to close it down and deport Morton. To Kepesh this was the alternative America that the rebels of the Sixties sought to recover. Rather cleverly the screenwriter, Nicholas Meyer, uses this discursive passage to open the movie as a sort of epigraph. He puts a shortened version into a fervent Kepesh's mouth during a TV interview. In the same interview Kepesh also mentions that this image of Merry Mount is what brought him to America, which is by way of explaining Kingsley's English accent.</p> <p>Despite the initial identification with Gandhi, the shaven-headed Kingsley has always carried more than a hint of menace, and this has been fully exploited when he's played gangsters, psychopaths and hitmen. One wonders what this picture would have been like with an actor less coiled and potentially explosive. But Kingsley conveys very well Kepesh's air of intellectual superiority and slightly smug intelligence, while remaining sufficiently sad and human to retain our sympathy. There's real tenderness in the erotic scenes with Cruz, and the interludes with Clarkson are beautifully handled. Those with Hopper are perfunctory, though the film's highlights include Hopper's deathbed sequence. So this is an enjoyable, often moving and generally well-considered film, though (as with Updike) the novelist's precise tone inevitably eludes the film-maker.</p>",

  "<p>The Lazarus Project is a remarkable book in its own right but one fact about its author keeps rushing from the background to take centre stage - that 15 years ago Aleksandar Hemon had only basic English. To have acquired as an adult the mastery required to publish literary fiction puts him in the same boat as Joseph Conrad, but oh how he rows it! With Conrad there's always the sense of someone inching warily over his own prose, anxious about whether it will hold his weight, while Hemon steps out fearlessly. He feels free to invent or extend words ('he unsmiled'), so that the narrator sees 'clouds and cloudettes' bunching up over a distant hill, and describes the armpits of his neighbour on a bus as 'onionesque'. Sometimes he seems to be working through all the possibilities of a relatively unusual Latin root - 'calenture', 'incalescent' - but his ear doesn't let him down. </p> <p>The few mistakes ('what rents it asunder', 'through the door ajar') are almost worth having, as a reminder of the distance travelled. Vocabulary and grammar are only two of the elements involved anyway, and it's as a phrase-maker and shaper of cadence that Hemon really shines. Take a sentence like this: 'The girlfriend was a comely young woman in a short, glittery skirt utterly unbefitting the idyllic catastrophe of the village.' The slightly old-fashioned choice of words seems risky all the way to 'idyllic catastrophe', incompatible strangers put hand in hand by a matchmaker who knows how to make verbal marriages work. Nabokov (whose own English dated from early childhood) would hardly have sneered. </p> <p>Hemon's narrator, Vladimir Brik, is (like the author) a Bosnian who arrived in Chicago in 1992, thereby missing the national trauma of the war and the siege of his home city, Sarajevo. Brik undertakes to write a book about the case of Lazarus Averbuch, a young Jewish immigrant from what is now Moldova, who called at the house of Chicago's chief of police in 1908 and was shot dead. Hemon interleaves polyphonic historical reconstruction - slipping, for instance, into newspaperese as well as the minds of historical characters - with an account of Brik's research trip to the places of Averbuch's origin (and, later, his own past), accompanied by his photographer friend Rora. The effect is rarely confusing, even when Hemon alternates paragraphs from the different levels of the book. </p> <p>Photographs, some from the Chicago Historical Society and some taken by Velibor Bozovic, reproduced against a black background, seem to converge stylistically in a way that destabilises the separateness of past and present. There's a similar artificial seepage at work in the prose, so that, for instance, the name of the assistant chief of police in 1908, Schuettler, is given to the Chicago philanthropist who funds Brik's research (real-life funding for the book was provided by the more august names of Guggenheim and MacArthur). This is normally a postmodernist tactic, but it's just as likely that Hemon enjoys undermining the solidity of his own fiction, just to show how robust it is, even so. The book contains plenty of formal self-unravelling of a more serious sort. There is no shortage of objections to any project of historical fiction - in his acknowledgements Hemon credits one source for 'more than the basic facts of the Lazarus affair', before adding 'to the extent that there are any facts in a work of fiction'. A historical novel is a story, and what do we expect from a story? In Brik's experience, Bosnians want brio above everything, while Americans want the truth, or think they do until they've heard it. Hemon obliges on both levels.</p> <p>The gentile Brik, researching a Jewish past, can hardly expect to connect with it: 'The two of us who could never have experienced the pogrom went to the Chisinau Jewish Community Center to find someone who had never experienced it and would tell us about it.' It's possible to be haunted by other people's ghosts as well as your own, but presumably Aleksandar Hemon, having planned the book to appear in the centenary year of Averbuch's death, is pleased to have it coincide also with the arrest of Radovan Karadzic.</p> <p>Any recreation of the past is a sort of Lazarus project, but what about the original one? What were the motives of 'Mr Christ' in that case? In Hemon's take on the world, the resurrected man is a special kind of immigrant.</p> <p>Immigration is his deepest subject and brings out his most brilliant writing. But the immigrant can't really go back, even if Brik, having had the experience of his own Bosnian-ness melting into everyone else's, can't imagine leaving Sarajevo again. This is an oddly forced end point for a remarkably unforced book. Why? Because an acquired language isn't a home, exactly, but (inhabited at this depth) it's something like one. The man who can describe someone as having 'no front teeth apart from a pair of incisor goalposts', in a language he mastered late in life, has knitted himself a new umbilical cord and a new belonging.</p>",
  "<p>Flared high-waisted trousers, white or navy 13/6... Arts Laboratory, Shouts and Murmurs, Osborne and Tynan...' These words represent some of the cultural signs of the times strewn on a kitchen table in a cramped top-floor flat in Hampstead, north London, in the summer of 1968.</p> <p>They were accompanied by 'Owl, guerrilla poets magazine... Rabbit food... Boat trip to France organised by the British Council for Peace in Vietnam...

The title was Time Out</p> <p>Chronicler of London living, bible of what's on where and originator of a worldwide publishing empire, Time Out turns 40 this week. During that time it has championed fringe theatre, radical politics and fashion; nurtured the careers of Julie Burchill, John Diamond, Ian Hislop, and Ian McEwan; broken hard news stories, been raided by Special Branch, gained recognition from Sydney to Buenos Aires and built a pantheon of interviewees including George Best, David Bowie, Robert De Niro, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Madonna, Harold Pinter and Andy Warhol.</p> <p>The milestone will be celebrated by two books and two exhibitions, including a display opening this week at the Museum of London which tells the recent history of the capital through the eyes of Time Out. It also represents a personal triumph for Tony Elliott, who was a 21-year-old student when he moved to London and set about 'trying to list anything and everything that produced good, interesting work'. Now the chairman of a multi-million pound company, Elliott predicts even more change in the next 40 years and the demise of Time Out in print as listings move on to the web.</p> <p>To read issue number one, published on 12 August 1968, is to peer inside a time capsule from the Swinging Sixties and re-imagine a year which saw political and cultural upheaval around the world. In March, London witnessed the Battle of Grosvenor Square when a 200,000-strong demonstration against the Vietnam war turned violent outside the American embassy. But August, according to Time Out's 'Marches/Meet the fuzz' section, would be less dramatic: 'Nothing much on this month,' it said. However, it did note the release of The Green Berets, starring John Wayne, with a warning: 'This is the first Vietnam glorification film, let it be the last!' It also listed a boat trip to France to protest against the war: 'Folkestone to Boulogne in boat carrying 1,000 people. Meeting there with representatives of the North Vietnamese delegation in Paris.'</p> <p>From Carnaby Street to the Roundhouse in Camden, London's counterculture was flowering. Readers of the first Time Out could go to Joe Cocker or Jethro Tull gigs at the Marquee on Wardour Street, catch a poetry reading on Petticoat Lane, dine on kidneys in red wine for 4/6d at Stockpot on Hogarth Place, watch a production of Euripedes's The Trojan Women set in Vietnam at Studio 68, listen to jazz at Ronnie Scott's or take in 'BLUEish' films at the Compton Cine Club on Old Compton Street.</p> <p>And so it went on, measured out in Time Out covers as the decades passed through punk and clubbing, 'loadsamoney' and Ken Livingstone, New Labour, Princess Diana and Facebook. Gay liberation in the Seventies was marked by a giant pink triangle on the front page and the headline: 'A mark of oppression becomes a badge of pride.' Toyah Willcox, red hair spiking out in all directions, was hailed as one of 'pop's new mini moguls' in 1982. Arnold Schwarzenegger, muscles rippling, stared out from the cover 20 years ago in August 1988. The face of Kate Moss dominated the London Fashion Week special of 2001. The Valentine's special of 2003, published on the eve of the invasion of Iraq, urged: 'Make love not war'.</p> <p>It had started with Elliott, student editor of an arts magazine at Keele University, visiting London and finding the cultural guides provided by the Evening Standard and so-called underground press far from definitive. He believed he could do better and recruited colleagues including Robert Harris, who would become better known as 'Whispering' Bob Harris, presenter of The Old Grey Whistle Test and now a host on Radio 2.</p> <p>Four days before going to press, they were advised to ditch their working title, Where It's At. Elliott came up with Time Out. He said last week: 'We didn't have to but it was the right decision. I knew it was classic, long-term, slightly abstract but actually had a specific meaning.'</p> <p>Sustained by toasted cheese sandwiches through the night, a team of four pulled the first issue together at Harris's small flat in Hampstead. The information was set with an IBM Golfball typewriter and, aided by \u00a370 from Elliott's aunt, taken to the London Caledonian Press, owned by the Communist party, for a print run of 5,000. These were distributed on the King's Road, Chelsea, at free concerts and in the bookshops and 'alternative' hangouts in the city.</p> <p>But 40 years later, there is dispute over who did what. The first issue's editorial puts Harris's name above that of Elliott, while referring to 'Elliott-Harris Publications'. On his personal website, Harris states that he 'co-founded' Time Out. But Elliott, 61, said: 'Bob drifted away very quickly; frankly, I threw him out after nine months because he disappeared. </p> <p>'I was running the business, organising all the distribution, doing all the design and layout. On a score of one to a hundred, Bob's role in my life has a number of about two.'</p> <p>Today Time Out, now edited by Gordon Thomson, has a weekly circulation of 87,000 and a website that chalks up 1.75 million unique users a month.

  "<p>Ice at the North Pole melted at an unprecedented rate last week, with leading scientists warning that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer by 2013.</p> <p>Satellite images show that ice caps started to disintegrate dramatically several days ago as storms over Alaska's Beaufort Sea began sucking streams of warm air into the Arctic.</p> <p>As a result, scientists say that the disappearance of sea ice at the North Pole could exceed last year's record loss. More than a million square kilometres melted over the summer of 2007 as global warming tightened its grip on the Arctic. But such destruction could now be matched, or even topped, this year.</p> <p>'It is a neck-and-neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss,' said Mark Serreze, of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado. 'We thought Arctic ice cover might recover after last year's unprecedented melting - and indeed the picture didn't look too bad last month. Cover was significantly below normal, but at least it was up on last year.</p> <p>'But the Beaufort Sea storms triggered steep ice losses and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the Arctic. We will only find out when the cover reaches its minimum in mid-September.'</p> <p>This startling loss of Arctic sea ice has major meteorological, environmental and ecological implications. The region acts like a giant refrigerator that has a strong effect on the northern hemisphere's meteorology. Without its cooling influence, weather patterns will be badly disrupted, including storms set to sweep over Britain.</p> <p>At the same time, creatures such as polar bears and seals - which use sea ice for hunting and resting - face major threats. Similarly, coastlines will no longer be insulated by ice from wave damage and will suffer erosion, as is already happening in Alaska.</p> <p>Other environmental changes are likely to follow. Without sea ice to bolster them, land ice - including glaciers - could topple into the ocean and raise global sea levels, threatening many low-lying areas, including Bangladesh and scores of Pacific islands. In addition, the disappearance of reflective ice over the Arctic means that solar radiation would no longer be bounced back into space, thus heating the planet even further.</p> <p>On top of these issues, there are fears that water released by the melting caps will disrupt the Gulf Stream, while an ice-free Arctic in summer offers new opportunities for oil and gas drilling there - and for political disputes over territorial rights.</p> <p>What really unsettles scientists, however, is their inability to forecast precisely what is happening in the Arctic, the part of the world most vulnerable to the effects of global warming. 'When we did the first climate change computer models, we thought the Arctic's summer ice cover would last until around 2070,' said Professor Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University. 'It is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become - for Arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates. Every few years we have to revise our estimates downwards. Now the most detailed computer models suggest the Arctic's summer ice is going to last for only a few more years - and given what we have seen happen last week, I think they are probably correct.'</p> <p>The most important of these computer studies of ice cover was carried out a few months ago by Professor Wieslaw Maslowski of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Using US navy supercomputers, his team produced a forecast which indicated that by 2013 there will be no ice in the Arctic - other than a few outcrops on islands near Greenland and Canada - between mid-July and mid-September. </p> <p>'It does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for Arctic ice,' Maslowski said. 'The crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap, you get a very clear indication that the Arctic is going to be ice-free in summer in five years. And when that happens, there will be consequences.'</p> <p>This point was backed by Serreze. 'The trouble is that sea ice is now disappearing from the Arctic faster than our ability to develop new computer models and to understand what is happening there. We always knew it would be the first region on Earth to feel the impact of climate change, but not at anything like this speed. What is happening now indicates that global warming is occurring far earlier than any of us expected.'</p>",
  "<p>I almost always remember where I was when reading a particular book. I read Henry Miller's Sexus and lots of PG Wodehouse in India, Clare Tomalin's biography of Pepys by a pool in Khartoum, all of Thomas Mann and much of Evelyn Waugh in Manchester and Frederick Forsyth's The Day of the Jackal working on a building site. The book and the place are forever joined in my memory, even if am at home.</p> <p>When I opened the booklet, which I think had a blue cover, containing the 6,000 words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Nobel acceptance speech, I was an 18-year-old sitting on Oxford station, perhaps a little pleased with myself at having bought it at WH Smith.</p> <p>It was as important a moment for me as reading Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon. I have always remembered roughly the paragraph that influenced me. Here is what he said:</p> <p>'To reach this chair from which the Nobel lecture is delivered, I have mounted not three or four temporary steps but hundreds or even thousands, fixed, steep, covered with ice, out of the dark and the cold where I was fated to survive, but others, perhaps more talented, stronger than I, perished. I myself met but few of them in the Gulag Archipelago... Of some I only heard; and of others I only guessed. Those with a name in literature who vanished into that abyss are, at least, known; but how many were unrecognised, never once publicly mentioned?... A whole national literature is there, buried without a coffin, without even underwear, naked, a number tagged on its toe.'</p> <p>He never climbed the Nobel podium in Stockholm because he rightly feared he would be not allowed to return to Russia. Oddly, his absence gave the words much more force - we were straining to hear a crackly radio broadcast from the heart of one of the darkest regimes in history. Today, it is almost impossible to capture what Solzhenitsyn meant and why young students like me read The First Circle, Cancer Ward and, later, the Gulag Archipelago, and felt awe at his achievement. </p> <p>Born in 1918, at the beginning of the Revolution, Solzhenitsyn survived imprisonment in the Gulag, went into disobliging exile in Vermont, where he never warmed to Americans - or they to him - and lived to see the collapse of communism. He returned to Russia in the Nineties and took a two-month train journey with his family from Vladivostok through his country, peering from the carriage windows at his briefly free, dishevelled homeland, and, after making 17 breaks in the journey, declared Russia to be 'tortured, stunned, altered beyond recognition'.</p> <p>He was no good at endearing himself or making concessions and, like many a Russian moralist, was often found wanting in his personal relations. Even so, the obituaries last week seemed strangely cool, sometimes even hostile. The implication was that he was a bore, unconcerned with style and too rebarbative and earnest for the West's literary salon. One writer said: 'Being outraged, and being right, and being a brave witness are not the same things as being a good writer, and Solzhenitsyn's writing fails to outlive its subject.'</p> <p>What I suspect this writer is saying is that Solzhenitsyn had served a purpose in the Cold War but had long since outlived his usefulness to the liberal West, which, now that the Gulag had been exposed and dismantled, could quietly forget any notion of his literary genius. Anyone who has read The First Circle - my favourite of his novels - or One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich will see that the literary powers of a 19th-century novelist - 'our living classic', as Yevgeny Yevtushenko put it - were brought to bear on the crime and tragedy of the 20th century.</p> <p>Solzhenitsyn was a great writer as the result of the collision of a particular personality and an awesome subject matter - one thinks of Wilfred Owen and the First World War, Primo Levi and Auschwitz - and it is absurd to try to separate him from the Gulag in order to suggest that in other respects - humanity, style and intelligence perhaps -he does not cut the mustard as a writer; that he would not have made it but for his subject.</p> <p>In his Nobel speech, Solzhenitsyn paid tribute to the greater talents who did not survive the Gulag. This - not literary egotism or stylistic dash - was plainly one of the propulsive forces of his output. He was not just a witness to the Gulag, as Levi was to the camps, he was somehow the representative of the writers who were 'never once publicly mentioned' - a heavy responsibility that few writers in the West can possibly imagine.</p> <p>Certainly Levi did. He and his subject will be linked as long as his books are read and the camps are remembered. So it seems odd that Solzhenitsyn did not receive the same sort of tributes as Levi after his suicide, even though he is bound in exactly the same way to the Gulag. One possible reason is that Solzhenitsyn - unlike Levi - was the willing instrument of great political forces, and that once the Cold War was over we forgot what he had been saying. His political success - few writers have had such an influence on their times - overwhelmed his message. </p> <p>Another more troubling possibility is that the Gulag, into which Solzhenitsyn estimated 60 million people vanished, is by some odd accord fading from the memory. In the Western consciousness, it has never occupied anything like the same place as the Holocaust. Even in Russia, the Gulag is being omitted from the school curriculum and is less and less mentioned by the members of the intelligentsia, who once stood by Solzhenitsyn but have now reached a grudging accommodation with their government. If anything, the worry must be not that Solzhenistyn's 'writing fails to outlive his subject', but that both are dead. </p> <p>'What can literature do against the pitiless onslaught of naked violence?' he asked in the Nobel speech. 'Let us not forget that violence cannot flourish by itself; it is inevitably intertwined with lying.'</p> <p>And forgetfulness.</p>",
  "<p><strong>On the idea that things must have a beginning being due to the poverty of our thoughts</strong></p> <p>Eleven endings to a piece of writing about the musician, realist and fantasist Damon Albarn and his creative sidekick and fellow conspirator, the graphic artist Jamie Hewlett.</p> <p>1. It's a glorious summer day in late July. Damon and Jamie finish their fags and beers on a roof terrace five floors above street level at the plush, gleaming Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. In 90 minutes or so the curtain will rise for the final performance of a four-day run of their Buddhist acrobatic meta-musical Monkey: Journey to the West. London stretches all around their perch at the heart of the establishment - the London Eye, Nelson's Column, the Houses of Parliament, Battersea Power Station. They are perhaps on top of the world, although the tousled, bleary-eyed, black-clad pair look as though they've just popped to their local for a gossip and a giggle. In one universe we can imagine that, as hot-shot entertainment producers with an uncanny, unlikely understanding of how to give the public what they want, with a daring twist, they are smoking cigars and drinking champagne. On the other hand, here are two close pals with the same contagious sense of humour and furtive relish for rearranging reality, both just turned 40, who can't believe they've just got away with what they've just got away with. They're already planning what, with luck, hard work and a good idea, they might get away with next. What language, century and country this project might be based in, what elusive, even invisible, name it will go by, how specialist and arcane the collaborators will be, is anyone's guess. Jamie takes a puff on his imaginary cigar. 'Anything is possible,' he grins. Damon cackles into his imaginary champagne. An airship gracefully floats past across the sky. For a second it appears that it has Monkey: Journey to the West emblazoned on it.</p> <p>2. Anything is possible.</p> <p>3. 'I kept having to look at the tickets,' says Damon, who's a bit more of a daredevil than his playmate, 'Just to check that we really were at the Royal Opera House. I mean, what an honour.'</p> <p>4. 'When it was first suggested we play the Royal Opera House,' marvels Jamie, the more mischievous of the two, 'I thought, brilliant, let's go for it. I didn't think through what it really meant to the purists, the idea of two scruffy oiks waltzing in through the door.'</p> <p>5. Damon: 'One of my mates turned up on opening night in flip-flops and shorts!'</p> <p>6. Jamie: 'I went to a cocktail party the other day with all the really posh opera types, and I turned up in my baseball hat with a hangover. I was talking to a famous ex-ballerina who is now one of the directors and she said to me, \"I think that people are rather freaked out by your hat.\" I didn't know what she meant, and at that point I made a gesture and knocked a tray of avocado canap\u00e9s all over her dress, thus confirming the general expectation of our loutish behaviour.'</p> <p>7. 'To be honest with you,' admits Damon, who's been working on Monkey for three years, 'when it comes to September, that's it. I'm doing something entirely different.'</p> <p>8. On the roof terrace of their west London headquarters a few months before Monkey plays at the Opera House, Damon waves at a train heading out of London, hoping as always that a driver or passenger might wave back.</p> <p>9. Things are not what they appear nor are they otherwise.</p> <p>10. Damon and Jamie explain what may be happening next to Monkey: Journey To The West, their obliquely enchanting version of the 16th-century Chinese allegorical adventure story based on the obscenely curious, naughty Monkey best known in more recent times as a chaotically dubbed haywire TV series imported from Japan. When it was premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2007, Monkey seemed a charming, gloriously impractical and surely temporary hybrid of surreal slapstick, mutant pop, Mandarin words, mental grace, flying monks, plate spinning, fractured opera, Hewlett's vivid visuals and Albarn's own particular quest for musical beauty. Later this year they envisage setting up a large matt black tent by the 02 Arena in Greenwich. The Chinese character for Monkey will glow in neon. There will be no ugly sponsorship. </p> <p>'You will be in Monkey world with no distractions,' promises Damon. Chinese masseuses will massage your feet in warm water before you eat Chinese food and then watch the show. 'Beautiful Chinese girls in golden Adidas tracksuits crunching your toes and mending all your stress...' dreams Jamie. 'When you emerge you won't believe where you are. Back to earth with a bump.' Damon: 'We're trying to create a mass-market version of something that started out pretty left-field.' They talk as though this will all really happen - a serious musical alternative to panto that faithfully examines, via clowning, body contortion and somersaulting, spiritual insight and how the greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything. 'It's such a great fucking story,' says Jamie. 'So much better than The Lion King. We've shown when you do this kind of thing it doesn't have to be Chicago with Denise Van Outen.'</p> <p>11. Jamie admits that even after more than 20 performances around the world he still feels moved at the climax of Monkey. 'It's pretty special. It's paradise! Fifteen lotus maidens in pyramid formation, some doing the splits and all spinning plates in front of the all-knowing Buddha... it's bliss.' Damon butts in: 'I just get anxious that the whole thing is going to collapse.' </p> <p><strong>On the fact that we do not normally look at things but overlook them</strong></p> <p>It's an isolated hot day in early spring, the kind of sunny day people describe as a first day of summer, even though it will only lead to monotonous weeks of grey English days. Damon and Jamie have recently moved into a new studio headquarters in west London, where Damon can write and record music that will inspire Jamie to imagine and animate characters that will in turn inspire Damon's music to leap limitations. It's their dream factory, tucked away on a modest street near the BBC, Wormwood Scrubs prison and the concrete Westway of the Clash and JG Ballard. Damon, who can be rangy and compact at the same time, greets me in his studio where he is working on the record version of the Monkey stage show. We move to the terrace at the side of some railway lines where he can light up and happily stare at the deliriously blue sky. A plane soars across on its way to Heathrow. 'This sky is like a pilot's view of the sky... god, being a pilot is such a glamorous job. Here we are just chatting away and above us there are actually people flying planes. Extraordinary.'</p> <p>A train speeds past us. Damon waves and urges me to do the same. We wave at the train, and no one waves back.</p> <p><strong>On being the change you wish to see in the world</strong></p> <p>I make the mistake of opening the interview a little vaguely by asking Damon what the agenda is today. I can immediately sense the often garrulous and gleeful Damon withdrawing at the way I've formally signalled 'an interview'. His self-confidence drains away. Damon will talk about anything, and seems to be theorising about something or other or raising some point whenever he enters or leaves a room or comfortably has your attention - his wife's delicious Victoria sponge; his daughter's reaction to the museums of Florence; the poor state of the nation's bread compared to France; the tendency for the English to make life a bit murky; the allure of travelling; the narcotic nature of X Factor-type shows; the genius of Scott Walker; Jack London's 1905 London underworld book The People of the Abyss; the first barbecue of the year; Gustave Dor\u00e9's engravings of the strange and savage 19th century east London; jazz being of no interest to him after Sun Ra; Chinese politics and the speed at which China is flying into the future; meeting Tony Blair at the Houses of Parliament before he was Prime Minister and realising that it was all wrong and he would never do that again; the outrageous synth-opera of 1970s cabaret surrealist Klaus Nomi; table tennis; his obsession with history as a clue to our future/or the idea that the past is the future; the legal drug industry; the genres of music no one has ever heard held on ageing tape and vinyl in the EMI Hayes vault; the loss of EMI's traditional values; the loss of Ken Livingstone's London dreams; Boris Johnson and London's TV-fuelled desire 'for a new kind of press conference'; the painful decline of the British Empire; the unpredictable emotional consequences of the internet; how we can learn from Africa more than they can learn from us how to deal with the extreme conditions ahead... he craves knowledge, information, speculation.</p> <p>He's not so keen on talking when it comes to a fixed, probing examination of what it is he's up to and why he does it and what it means and why he's so restless. He likes conversation, but not really centred on himself, or at least not his private self. He likes swapping random ideas and miscellaneous thoughts about this, that and the other. He doesn't like the shifting randomness and fizzy miscellany of his mind being spoiled by the dried-up specifics of a magazine interview. Luckily for him, at times when we might be getting bogged down in some area of his biography, or searching a little too doggedly for commercial motive or artistic definition, a train will shoot past and we break from the talk for a wave. Perhaps we are taking a break to consider the idea that life is always moving, flowing and changing, and the less said about that the better.</p> <p>I mention the word 'agenda' because there is so much that Damon has been up to since he left the relatively conventional pop group confines of Blur and transformed into a more flexible musician, thinker and activist that we might today be talking about any number of things. The synergetic Africa Express; his Honest Jon's record label and the Honest Jon's Revue representing his wide-ranging and wonderfully eccentric musical enthusiasms; the ambient dub punk group with no name known by the title of their album, The Good, The Bad and the Queen; the glamorously moody virtual pop group Gorillaz who may or may not have now magically evolved into the virtual group Monkey, who have made an album that may or may not be directly connected to the psychology and sonic flamboyance of the Journey to the West opera; the trailers and title sequence Albarn and Hewlett have produced for the BBC coverage of the Beijing Olympics. The Monkey record which does not feature Damon singing and is a sort of ecstatic, melancholy electro-ghost of the opera.</p> <p>Damon fears it is me that has the agenda, that I am going to nag him about China's human rights record, which has somehow become their responsibility; that I might take the line that he's a slapdash, exploitative musical dabbler skimming surfaces and producing experimental novelties that will not endure; that I am going to drag up the Nineties celebrity nonsense that he has worked hard to bury; that I am going to question when people will be bored with the visibly invisible cerebral sensualist Damon, and wonder when it's all going to go horribly wrong. Or maybe I'm going to love him and the way he dons masks, sheds skins and discreetly reinvents himself, the way he lives for music, crosses and blurs musical borders with considerable respect, designs hybrids with great care, love him far too much. I might add more dubious sparkle to the rampaging Monkey hype, where in a way Albarn is the provocative, impertinent Monkey who has learnt to find his faults, feel deep regret, and correct his mistakes, to reform sincerely, practise kindness, concentrate the mind, sever selfishness, and awaken. (There are in fact three Monkeys in all this - the cuddlier cartoon BBC Monkey, the slightly more sinister rascally Monkey in the opera and the much more menacing Monkey of the record. Damon too can be sweet, brazen and wrathful.)</p> <p>Adulation ultimately worries Albarn more than the suspicion he feels has followed him all through his music career. Those that adore you can quickly be disappointed. Those that adore you expect more than you might want to give.</p> <p><strong>On making yourself into zero that you might become invincible</strong></p> <p>Albarn reluctantly toys with the word agenda, and finds his way to answer. He talks in a cultivated drawl that's casual and intense and sometimes verges on seeing the irony in everything and/or sounding wounded by the appalling injustices of life. 'Well, it's been a different way of making a record, and after spending over three years on Monkey I didn't want it to be just a straight theatrical recording of the stage performance. I now know a lot about the musical ideas I want to explore but not necessarily what form they should be in. It's with the form of a record where you set an agenda. I've been lucky so far that the form I've found for the records I've put out since Blur has worked. It remains to be seen whether an electro record in Mandarin is going too far, but I don't regret it because I've enjoyed the process. And if you worry about what people want, you start to give them what you think that is, and that's a tendency I've tried to resist. Not because I don't love people liking what I do - I need that as much as anyone - it's just... it has to be an adventure. When you make a new piece of music you want to go on an adventure.'</p> <p>A goods train thunders by. We wave. The driver looks at us. He does not wave. Damon shakes his head. 'I think if you wave long enough eventually someone will wave back and that will be... very nice.'</p> <p><strong>On understanding both sides</strong></p> <p>Jamie arrives at the operation HQ. He's in pain. Proving when drunk to some friends that he could still do high kicks even though he was approaching 40, he did one too many and slipped a disc. He's been lying on his side for three weeks listening to Radio 4 with a small easel next to him. He's come to listen to some music so that he can continue drawing characters and scenes for the Monkey record artwork.</p> <p>Damon and Jamie are extremely at ease in one other's company and have started to resemble each other even though they don't actually look alike. They bicker and banter like a comedy double act that's been together for years. 'He takes care of his side and I take care of my side,' says Jamie simply, with a shrug. 'We never tread on what the other does,' says Damon, as if all is revealed about their collaborations. Back in the Blur days Hewlett was more the friend of guitarist Graham Coxon, and Damon says at the time he felt excluded from some private joke they were both in on. Now Albarn and Hewlett are the jokers. They decide together on various far-fetched schemes and themes, and marvel as one or two of them actually come to life. Damon veers off into other projects, so does Jamie, but they never seem to feel insecure about their partner mixing with other schemers and dreamers.</p> <p>They followed up a debut Gorillaz album that seemed to have completed that particular mission with the deeper, darker time bomb pop of Demon Daze, where the challenge they set themselves was not to do something completely different but something the same but better. Monkey is Gorillaz in disguise, or Gorillaz without the disguise, or something completely different but the same, or more theories about life and death, joy and sadness, with an inventive, evocative, often deliciously apprehensive and edgily elegant Albarn soundtrack. It is written and produced by Albarn, although it is not as such an Albarn solo album, which would seem horribly prosaic. It's by Monkey, not as such the character in the opera, but a convenient name for this particular release, another of Damon's make-believe groups that both do and do not exist. For Damon, the name of a pop group is merely the foam on a wave, the shadow of a shadow.</p> <p><strong>On how when you realise how perfect everything is you will tilt your head back and laugh at the sky</strong></p> <p>Albarn: 'We had all the Malians come over to rehearse for the Honest Jon's Revue and we had them at the studio. It was a lovely day so we rehearsed on the roof by the railway lines. There were 30 Mali musicians playing very loud music and whenever a train came past we all waved! People must have thought, did I actually see that, or have I had a very long and tiring day. No one waved back, though.'</p> <p><strong>On how since everything is a reflection of our minds everything can be changed with our minds</strong></p> <p>Monkey began as an exploration of traditional Chinese culture in a dreamily symbolic setting and it has now gained a pressing contemporary edge with their official BBC collaboration and the risk to the safe commercial delivery of an Olympic tournament due to the Chinese persecution of Tibetan monks.</p> <p>Albarn: 'We didn't go into it without our eyes shut, not thinking that at some point there was going to be a lot of scrutiny of China and their human rights. The Chinese are totalitarian in the sense that they do not as a society tolerate deviation from what they think should be done. Within that they are a very liberal-minded society, and that dichotomy is very difficult to understand. Who knows what will happen in Beijing. It's a very volatile situation. But I do know that we have to understand and engage with China.'</p> <p>Hewlett: 'And do not take it for granted that the Chinese people agree with the actions of the Chinese government. If it does all blow up in our faces, I would still stand up for the fact that we did this. The level of understanding in the West of this vast country and its people is very low and if you get a chance why not do what you can to shine a light on its ways.'</p> <p><strong>On the fact that where there is light there is shadow</strong></p> <p>Albarn: 'Our experience while doing this project had made us appreciate that Chinese culture is brighter and stronger than American culture. They've a lot to answer to when it comes to human rights and they can be very belligerent but that's because there's one-and-a-half billion of them. Look, when we started Monkey we had something very strong that we wanted to say about China. It now has a political context. There's nothing we can do about that and usually when it comes to something like Tibet I would be in the camp of those who complain and protest. I now find myself in the strange position that while I agree with the stone-throwers I understand the other position. I understand the glass that is having the stones thrown at it even as I could be throwing the stones. I'm not agreeing at all with what China is doing but I think it is important that a dialogue with China keeps going or they'll disappear behind a wall for ever.'</p> <p>Hewlett: 'And then you'll never know what's going on there.'</p> <p>Will this be the Chinese century in the way that the 20th century was the American century ?</p> <p>Albarn: 'There are certain elements of Chinese culture that could be considered Utopian if it did happen. At the same time there is this dark shadow across all the positivity. It's a society that is mutating all the time and they could yet absorb the worst part of our culture and it will all be a complete mess. Yes, it is the Chinese century but what sort of China it will be I can't imagine.'</p> <p><strong>On all philosophies being mental fabrications</strong></p> <p>Albarn's writing studio is three floors up and is filled with musical scores that he likes to read for inspiration, old folk songs, hymns and choral pieces. There's an old solid metal typewriter he bought in Florence that he uses to write out his lyrics. It was made in Germany. He wonders if perhaps it's from the 1940s, and is therefore a Nazi typewriter. The thought perversely pleases him. There are some windows that give him views of the sky and some trees on the opposite side of the street. 'I'm writing my music looking out of a little window while planes go by.' He plays me some of the Monkey music, which blends the idealised sound of peaceful, ancient, remote China with the deafening honks, babble and urgency of modern China, and the trees opposite sway and rustle in time with the music. Damon dances to his music, unashamedly lost in the thoughts he's having about how three years of thoughts - about the history and future of China, about how to follow up Blur, Gorillaz, his Mali music, his film soundtracks, the decaying London of The Good, the Bad and the Queen, his own perfectionist craving for newness that honours oldness, for strangeness that emphasises romance - have turned into an electric music that is clearly by the musician responsible for the above, and yet by a new kind of musician. Listening to Monkey you can tell it's made by a musician who can cry when he hears a piece of music that moves him. </p> <p><strong>On how once all struggle is grasped, miracles are possible</strong></p> <p>Just before the final Monkey show at the Royal Opera House, Opera magazine host an informal discussion, exploring for a classical readership unfamiliar with Albarn's pop music the possibility that Journey to the West might actually not just be hyperbolically called an opera but might actually be an opera. (Albarn has never suggested one way or another that it is or isn't, knowing only perhaps that it is a melodramatic performance of an often baffling story without much speaking and a fair amount of passion, best seen in a theatre. For him, it is nothing but Monkey. He let's others - management, theatres, publicists, writers, critics - battle it out for the most helpful commercial, creative and/or critical definition, amused by the struggle.)</p> <p>A young classical music critic, Erica Jeal, sits with Damon and the production's musical director David Coulter, the adventurous Berlin-born conductor Andr\u00e9 de Ridder and the theatre and film director Chen Shi-Zheng, who directed the performances and trawled Chinese theatre schools for the large mobile cast. Hewlett cheerfully excuses himself from this duty. The proudly eclectic Albarn is in his element, a leader, but part of a team, the centre of attention, but just part of a group of articulate talkers and thinkers who are all experts in their world.</p> <p>The conversations chart the growth of Monkey from the early field recordings in old and new, peasant and city China to the orchestral production, and how Albarn resisted creating a dreaded fusion of rock and Chinese music by filtering his response to Chinese sounds and systems through his own rigorous compositional technique. For Shi-Zheng, Albarn has crafted an authentic, personal symbiosis of East and West and he admires how Albarn can express an idea musically in the most concise form, with the greatest simplicity of means, with freshness and life.</p> <p>Albarn didn't want to try to please both the pop audience and a classical audience and miss both targets. He talks about hearing noises wherever he is, the street, an airport, a farm, and how that can then become a piece of music. 'I sit in the studio and find some noises and then get stoned and see what happens,' he confesses. Erica worries whether Damon's publicist will be alarmed to hear him say that. Albarn snorts at the thought. His colleagues describe how Albarn's logical but instinctive approach to new music is so refreshing compared to the rigid and institutionalised classical music standard. Shi-Zheng explains how he wanted to do Monkey in English. It was Damon who insisted it should be in Mandarin.</p> <p>Composers are mentioned such as Bartok, for the field recordings and folksong appropriation, Monteverdi, 'because seeing L'Orfeo was a pivotal moment', the 12th century Perotin, for the power of voices, Satie, for the elysian simplicity, Michael Tippett for the harrowing emotion. 'In a way I am quite old fashioned, and love the romantic bigness, the stirring, quite nationalistic sound of Elgar and Vaughan Williams and those big emotional melodies always creep into what I do. But I also love Stockhausen.'</p> <p>At the end of the conversation, Erica asks Damon to sign the cover of Blur's Think Tank.</p> <p><strong>On people being like monkeys frantically grasping for the moon in the water</strong></p> <p>As we talk by the railway lines, Blur crops up, and I make a reference to 'the glory days'. 'These days if I'm on stage I like to be at the back playing the piano. It's strange because in the glory days, you couldn't stop me from being at the front. Now I'm the complete opposite. I suppose I now want to let the music do all the work. I love singing, and I will do more, but I feel it's difficult being a front man.'</p> <p>Was he any good at it ?</p> <p>'I suppose I must have been good at it and I definitely put my heart and soul into it. I did find it difficult and I did envy everyone else having an instrument. I suppose I overcompensated. It's just that now I really enjoy being in the background. I just didn't want to be confined to the cool rock image thing. I was always kind of belligerent with that and it perhaps came across as arrogant and cocksure. I'm not like that now. It's got something to do with growing up. '</p> <p>Since Blur, he has been negotiating different ways of being in the background without completely sacrificing star presence.</p> <p>'It's the key to maintaining a career as you get older. I do love performing, but if I had been at the centre of the Monkey performance on stage it would have done my head in. I mean, I've been successful being in the background because of the music. The music was good enough to allow me to be in the background without anyone missing me. It was such a nice sound, Gorillaz, and I've come back to it a lot on this Monkey record. There is some concern from various formal places about whether that makes it a Gorillaz record... or not... and I suppose knowing one way or another might help it in the marketplace. On the other hand, it's the same music whatever you call it, by the same people.'</p> <p>Does he play games with his persona as famous pop star ?</p> <p>'Not really. You cannot be unaware that an awful lot of people recognise you. I was looking at MTV's Cribs because I saw that Alex James was going to be on and as I hadn't been to his house I thought it would be a nice way to see the place. Not that he hasn't invited me, I hasten to say. But it was the 10 most richest Cribs that was on and it made me feel... better in a sense about myself, that this was how far out of control the conceits of pop stardom can take you. I was watching it as punter, in every sense of the word, and it was alarming to me. I don't think it's healthy to be famous unless you are very down to earth and even though I am moderately down to earth I have no desire to be famous. It did nearly get out of control for me in the Nineties obviously. Blur and Oasis connected the tabloids with pop music in a way that hadn't really happened before. It's not something to be necessarily proud of. I was greatly disorientated. I can draw a line from then to how they've gone after Amy Winehouse and Pete Doherty. It's absolutely not a world that musicians should be anywhere near. In the end, I hung on by a thread.'</p> <p>A passenger train races by and our yearning waves rescue him from dwelling too much on his gaudy, soapy Britpast, before he found Jamie, and musical groups that lacked conventional shape and fixed personnel, and China, and saw how the greatest wisdom comes from seeing through appearances.</p> <p><strong>On how your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts</strong></p> <p>Because of their Chinese experience, Albarn and Hewlett were asked by the BBC if they would talk about writing the music and creating the images for their Olympic coverage. Jamie recalls how when Damon heard of the BBC's interest he said, well, if they want to make music of a Chinese nature, they should be talking to us. 'We both agreed that we should have that job and not let any other idiot have it.'</p> <p>Damon rolls his eyes, fearing private enthusiasm has slipped out and might remind people of previous pomposity.</p> <p>Hewlett:: 'It's true! That's what you said.'</p> <p>Albarn : 'Yeah, right, if you say so.'</p> <p>Hewlett : 'If anyone is going to do Chinese music for the BBC, it's you.'</p> <p>Albarn : 'Well, that's not strictly true...'</p> <p>'Hewlett: 'OK then, how are you going to spin it ?'</p> <p>A train shoots by. Damon waves. Jamie and I join in.</p> <p>On how the rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between friends, each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other, always using friendly and sincere words</p> <p>Damon runs off to fetch coffee and bread-and-butter pudding at a deli. Jamie and I are alone by the railway lines, waving at the trains with a little less commitment than when we're with Damon. 'What I was trying to say before, when Damon pulled a funny face, the BBC were no doubt talking to other people and we just felt we were qualified to do this, because we've spent the last few years immersing ourselves in Chinese culture. And we'd want to do it really well in a way that not only suits the BBC and all the demographic boxes they must tick but which retains our sensibility. Who else were they going to get to do it?'</p> <p>Mike Batt?</p> <p>'Those are the kind of people they usually go to. Phil Collins. Elton John. Never in our wildest dreams did we think they would ask us, that we'd be in with the BBC. I wonder what kind of doors that might open? Then again, everyone will be sick of it by the end of the summer. That bloody song again and that bloody monkey.'</p> <p>Damon arrives carrying coffee and cake for three. 'That's not easy on a bicycle,' he boasts. A train hurtles past. We wave. Nothing in return. 'Damon's hoping that one day a ghostly face might wave back. He looks a bit like the boy from \"Duelling Banjos\" when he does it. No wonder no one waves back.'</p> <p>Albarn: 'It is a bit Forrest Gump, I suppose.'</p> <p>What if someone did wave back?</p> <p>'I'd get very self-conscious and never do it again, probably.'</p> <p><strong>On how your work is to discover your work and then with all your heart give yourself to it</strong></p> <p>Eleven beginnings to a piece of writing about the one or the two known as Monkey.</p> <p>1. It's a glorious summer day in late July. On a roof terrace of the Royal Opera House, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, who on this occasion are representing themselves singly as man who writes music and man who draws pictures and together as Monkey formerly known, possibly, as Gorillaz, who were flesh and blood cartoon characters. Damon Albarn has checked in on some rehearsals for the final Opera House performance of the Journey to the West opera, and he is not happy. The soundman has been sneaking reverb in - an unforgivable sin - and one or two of the musicians and singers are not concentrating enough. He's had to let his feelings be known about their slackness in front of his daughter, and it's made him uncomfortable.</p> <p>'You can have bad gigs and good gigs and just because this is a massive theatrical performance doesn't make it any different, but I got the feeling today that people were resting on their laurels just because there has been a brilliant commercial and critical reaction, and I do not like that. This is a very proud moment for us and no one should take it for granted. We may never get a chance like this again.</p> <p>'I have seen this kind of hype so many times before, and it's the worst thing that can happen in a way. Of course you want everyone to go nuts and go wild, but you have got to be really, really smart when that happens and be aware that it can turn your head and lead to self-destruction.'</p> <p>Is he watching himself by making sure things are in order?</p> <p>'I am checking myself, because none of them are going to get in the shit if it goes wrong, even if it is their fault. The reviews are great, therefore at every performance we have to make sure we are excellent and that we deserve those reviews.'</p> <p>2. 'Chen Shi-Zheng has taught us about the Buddhist principle that you must not mourn for the past, or worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but live in the present moment wisely and earnestly. That's why we call him Chairman Now.'</p> <p>3. As the current Albarn-Hewlett group project is called Monkey, it appears that their next abstract venture will be called something in Spanish (Carosella, maybe) and it will be something to do with a war machine, or a cavalry training mechanism - the source of modern merry-go-rounds - and it might be on ice, or refer to the carnival carousel in Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes where you grow older or younger depending on which way you ride. Musically, there will possibly be a reference to Albarn's passion for the kinetic tunes Bertolt Brecht lyrics would be fastened to. And some Human League. 'There's always some Human League. I remember the moment I became a little bit more political when I spliced on tape some of my Dad's Arabic recordings over the Human League's 'The Lebanon'. Heaven 17's Penthouse and Pavement was a favourite. And there's the Specials and the Combat Rock Clash and Big Audio Dynamite. But when I was a kid I had all this access to African and Asian and Indian music and spirituals, Paul Robeson. That was what I listened to growing up. That was what was played at home. Sufi music. I absorbed it all. I didn't arrive at this non-pop music in a Beatles-like revelation. It was always there. In a way, pop took me away from it for a while.'</p> <p>4. Anything is possible. You should hear their idea about what they want to do for the live broadcast when the Beijing Olympics hands over to the London Games. I don't want to give away the surprise, but it involves Buckingham Palace, Phil Daniels and a Chinese choir.</p> <p>5. Albarn: 'I do not understand bands that just go on and on and on and on and when they make a record they always end up in the same place. Pop groups can be very militant about their sound and retain it for ever. I suppose it's because they do not want to lose touch with their audience. They really love their audience. It's a friendship they don't want to threaten by changing.'</p> <p>6. Hewlett: 'We had fantastic lunches with Terry Gilliam about turning Journey to the West into a film. That's the closest we ever got to a Monkey film.' Albarn: 'We spend a lot of our life talking about a film.'</p> <p>7. 'Hewlett: 'Maybe China will be the first Empire to really conquer space.'</p> <p>And unlike America they won't take God with them.</p> <p>Albarn: 'That's the great thing about China. They don't have this insane idea that there's a man in a white beard sitting in the sky. They think about life more cosmically.'</p> <p>8. Albarn: 'I don't think Blur ever fulfilled their full potential. But it doesn't matter if they never do. Graham Coxon is happy doing what he's doing and I'm happy doing what I'm doing. So that's all right then.'</p> <p>9. Has Damon Albarn become a kind of David Bowie, shifting from musical space to musical space, pulling off conjuring trick after conjuring trick, like a shifty postmodern musical wizard? Or, after his flirtation with pop stardom, is he releasing increasingly obscure projects with increasingly confusing promotional attachments hoping that he can shake off the burden of an audience and live happily ever after left alone in his own splendid, peaceful musical universe?</p> <p>10. At the end of the Opera magazine discussion, Damon suddenly exclaims: 'This experience has changed my life! I will never be the same again!' Everyone looks at him. Is this a cue for everyone to burst into song and dance around the room? Damon is a bit shamefaced at this emotional outburst, worried that it's a sign he's believing his own publicity. He quickly reverts to slightly gloomier type and mooches off to scold some musicians.</p> <p>11. A packed passenger train roars past their west London headquarters.

  "<p>Sometimes you just wish you were a photographer. I simply do not have the words to describe the awesome majesty of Greenland's Kangia glacier, shedding massive icebergs the size of skyscrapers and slowly pushing them down the Ilulissat fjord until they crash into the ocean off the island's west coast. There, these natural ice sculptures float and bob around the glassy waters near here. You can sail between them in a fishing boat, listening to these white ice monsters crackle and break, heave and sigh, as if they were noisily protesting their fate.</p> <p>You are entirely alone here amid the giant icebergs, save for the solitary halibut fisherman who floats by. Our Greenlandic boat skipper sidles up to the tiny fishing craft, where my hosts buy a few halibut right out of his nets, slice open the tender cheeks and cut me the freshest halibut sushi I've ever tasted. 'Greenland fast food,' quips Kim Kielsen, Greenland's minister of the environment.</p> <p>We wash it down with Scotch cooled by a 5,000-year-old ice cube chipped off one of the floating glacier bits. Some countries have vintage whisky. Some have vintage wine. Greenland has vintage ice.</p> <p>Alas, though, I do not work for National Geographic. This is an opinion piece. And my trip with Denmark's minister of climate and energy, Connie Hedegaard, to see the effects of climate change on Greenland's ice sheet leaves me with a very strong opinion: our kids are going to be so angry with us one day. We've charged their future on our Visa cards. We've added so many greenhouse gases to the atmosphere for our generation's growth that our kids are likely going to spend a good part of their adulthood, maybe all of it, just dealing with the climate implications of our profligacy. And now our leaders are telling them the way out is 'offshore drilling' for more climate-changing fossil fuels. Madness. Sheer madness.</p> <p>Most people assume that the effects of climate change are going to be felt through another big disaster, like Hurricane Katrina. Not necessarily, says Minik Thorleif Rosing, a top geologist at Denmark's National History Museum and one of my travelling companions. 'Most people will actually feel climate change delivered to them by the postman,' he explains. It will come in the form of higher water bills, because of increased droughts in some areas; higher energy bills, because the use of fossil fuels becomes prohibitive; and higher insurance and mortgage rates, because of much more violently unpredictable weather. Remember: climate change means 'global weirding' not just global warming.</p> <p>Greenland is one of the best places to observe the effects of climate change. Because the world's biggest island has just 55,000 people and no industry, the condition of its huge ice sheet - as well as its temperature, precipitation and winds - is influenced by the global atmospheric and ocean currents that converge here. Whatever happens in China or Brazil is felt here. And because Greenlanders live close to nature, they are walking barometers of climate change. That's how I learnt a new language: Climate-Speak.</p> <p>It's easy to learn. There are only three phrases. The first is: 'Just a few years ago...' </p> <p>Just a few years ago you could dogsled in winter from Greenland, across a 40-mile ice bank, to Disko Island. But for the past few years, the rising winter temperatures in Greenland have melted that link. Now Disko is cut off. Put away the dogsled.</p> <p>The second phrase is: 'I've never seen that before...' It rained in December and January in Ilulissat. This is well above the Arctic Circle. It's not supposed to rain here in winter.</p> <p>Steffen said: 'Twenty years ago, if I had told the people of Ilulissat it would rain at Christmas 2007, they would have just laughed at me. Today it is a reality.'</p> <p>The third phrase is: 'Well usually... but now I don't know any more.' The river that was always there is now dry. The glacier that always covered that hill has disappeared. The reindeer that were always there when the hunting season opened on 1 August didn't show up. No wonder everyone here speaks climate now - your kids will, too, and sooner than they think.</p>",
  "<h2>Foreign languages should be fun</h2> <p>I am one of the language teachers whose services were no longer required when students learnt that they could drop languages at the end of year nine (Focus, last week). I thought your piece was excellent and would like to add that in my opinion 'fun', 'time' and 'relevance' need to be addressed.</p> <p>These days we are under such pressure to cover the National Curriculum and schemes of work that fun, drama, songs and games, which used to be a large and enjoyable part of my teaching, have gone out of the window.</p> <p>Most countries I know of devote far more time than we do to foreign languages. In my school, students had two hours a week of one language and then in year eight most of them had to take up a second one for just one hour a week, regardless of how they had got on with the first one. And we are surprised when languages are not taken seriously?</p> <p>If the fun has gone, you're getting two hours a week at the most and you are not encouraged to get immersed in the target culture. I cannot see how significant progress can be made.</p> <p><strong>Richard Smart</strong><br>Abingdon, Oxon</p> <p>I am an A-level languages student at a sixth-form college, previously educated at a state comprehensive. I was interested to read Liz Lightfoot's article, as somebody who has been severely let down by state school language provision.</p> <p>I began learning French at 10, when I gave up one lunchtime a week to learn a few basics. At GCSE I opted to take French and German, the only two languages offered. Language teaching was fragmented and confusing. Teachers were forced to focus on exam dates and coursework deadlines, instead of providing us with a basic framework of grammar and vocabulary. My reports said I had a 'natural aptitude' and was 'fluent' in the spoken word. It transpired that 'fluent' meant I could keep speaking without near-constant prompting from my teacher; I could not make myself understood to a native speaker. </p> <p>During five years of learning two languages at secondary school I was only once offered the opportunity to go abroad (the trip was subsequently cancelled). For my GCSE oral exams everyone was forced to learn their topics off by heart: this meant memorising 10 pages each of French and German, to be regurgitated in the exam. I left after my GCSEs with no knowledge of tenses and little knowledge of basic grammar. Despite this, I achieved an A* in German and an A in French. </p> <p>Lightfoot does not consider one key reason for students' disenchantment with languages - the arrogance of a country lucky enough to speak one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. When I was 14, and learning a modern language was compulsory, one girl shouted at our German teacher: 'Why do I have to learn this stupid language? I'll never go to Germany, and they all speak English anyway!'</p> <p><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <h2>Sloanes are OK, ya?</h2> <p>Carole Cadwalladr's spiky article 'The rebirth of posh' (Review, last week) was very interesting, but two points. Peter York was not the author of the original Sloane Ranger's Handbook, 1982; it was a communal book by 60 Harpers &amp; Queen contributors, woven together by me as features editor and deputy editor (and Sloane Ranger person). Peter York was the co-author, for his media skills. </p> <p>My other concern is confusing the Sloane Ranger with the super-rich. Sloane Rangers are not necessarily well-off or aristocrats, but a stratum of a bygone middle class, at least one rung down from David Cameron and friends. They work behind the scenes to help the community, but do not expect to lead it - and don't all vote Tory.</p> <p><strong>Ann Barr</strong><br>London W11</p> <h2>Modern man's identity crisis</h2> <p>Elizabeth Day's piece 'Depressed, repressed, objectified: are men the new women?' (Observer Woman, last week) raised some important issues.</p> <p>The significantly shorter lifespan of men is still the elephant in the room when it comes to arguing equality, and is generally discounted by those who seemingly see early death as some kind of male privilege, rather than a measure of how society values men, or how men are taught to value themselves.</p> <p>The examples of male status earned through self-sacrifice (soldiering and exploring) are horribly out of date. The idea that male status is dependent on a willingness to risk death is at the core of the modern male's identity crisis. Men need to radically change their view of what is required of them. However, I am not sure our society would be willing to give up the many benefits which arise from men's willingness to sacrifice their lives for the general good.</p> <p>The writings of Warren Farrell et al provide a long overdue counterbalance to the systematic traducement of men. These books are essential reading for anyone concerned with the problems that boys and men, raised in a society which holds them in contempt, now face.</p> <p><strong>Steve Wade</strong><br>Birmingham</p> <h2>Power struggle</h2> <p>In most cases over 10 years ago, I already did all the things you suggest in 'Home improvements that will cut your bills' (special report, last week).

I demand you print a knitting pattern for a house cosy!</p> <p><strong>Gill Heritage</strong><br>Stockport, Cheshire</p> <h2>Wise after the event</h2> <p>I ignored your editorial of two weeks ago in which you said Lillian Ladele should not have become a registrar if she felt unable to officiate at same-sex 'marriages' because of her religious convictions. Now Nick Cohen has repeated the view (Comment, last week), I must respond. Ladele has been a registrar for 17 years. Civil partnerships have only been legal since December 2005. Are you suggesting she should not have become a registrar in 1991 because she ought to have anticipated civil partnerships would be made legal in 2005? </p> <p><strong>Brian Baggott </strong><br>Oxford </p> <h2>End asylum seekers' suffering</h2> <p>Gaby Hinsliff writes: 'The Health Secretary, Alan Johnson, is said to be privately fighting the plans but is under pressure from the Home Office' ('GPs attack ban on asylum seekers', last week).

  "<p><strong>DOONE VALLEY, EXMOOR<br>SIR RANULPH FIENNES, EXPLORER</strong></p> <p>Doone Valley is best known as the setting for Lorna Doone, and as the location of the legendary Doones - brigands of a similar type to Robin Hood's men. Discussion still rages as to whether they truly existed, or were just the creation of RD Blackmore, author of the novel. </p> <p>The valley itself has beautiful woods and rhododendron trees and is the kind of place where you can go running on a bank holiday and not meet a soul. Most people who visit Exmoor stick to the coastal road between Porlock and Lynmouth and rarely venture far inland. It is their loss, but the gain of the valley, which has remained so unspoilt. There is a tranquillity to the place that is rarely found in England. The tiny village of Oare - just a church and a few houses - is where fact and fiction meet; there is a bullet hole in the window that mirrors the shot fired at the denouement of the novel. Of the visitors who make it to Oare, few explore beyond, but it is the lush landscapes that spread out from beyond the village that are truly worth discovering. </p> <p><strong>NORTH RONALDSAY<br>MARK COCKER, AUTHOR AND NATURALIST</strong></p> <p>On the map the most northerly island of the Orkney archipelago reminds me of a eagle's head staring out from the British Isles towards the Norwegian coast. This narrow island is just four miles long and at the house where my wife was brought up, family legend has it that the Atlantic runs up to the backyard. Yet from the front bedroom window one looks out towards the North Sea.</p> <p>Low, flat, windy and increasingly devoid of people (the school now has three children) North Ronaldsay is a place of flag-roofed crofts, grazing pasture and flower-rich meadows. You slowly realise that the magical atmosphere of this place resides in its three great modern absentees: a lack of artificial light, lack of mechanical noise and a lack of any need to know the time.</p> <p>Aside from the crofts of the 40 residents, the lighthouse, the church and the laird's traditional manse, North Ronaldsay is home to Orkney's largest human artefact: the 'sheep dike'. This stone wall encircles the entire shoreline and is there not to keep the livestock in, but to retain its unique semi-wild sheep upon the beach.</p> <p>Many of these tiny creatures have coats the colour of polished mahogany, and some of the kitten-sized lambs are pure black. The adults' salt-loaded fleeces can look like tramps' rags upon their backs. Yet the rams' horns have sumptuous curls and when they clamber up on the rocks to stare philosophically out towards an Atlantic horizon, they acquire a kind of dishevelled grandeur.</p> <p>Sitting among this Neolithic stock, listening to the seals singing from the breakers or watching porpoises across the bay is one of the finest ways I know to shed the worries of the world. I am Derbyshire born and bred but arriving on North Ronaldsay feels like a homecoming. Leaving is always tinged with sadness.</p> <p><strong>ST MARY'S WELL, LLYN PENINSULA<br>CHRISTOPHER SOMERVILLE, TRAVEL WRITER</strong></p> <p>The holy well of St Mary lies in a cleft of the cliffs opposite the island of Bardsey, an ancient focus for pilgrimages, out at the westernmost tip of the Llyn peninsula in north west Wales. The scramble to reach the well is an exciting and potentially dangerous one. The ancient catwalk along the rocks is slippery with weed, and only a few inches wide. The receding tide washes it every few seconds. Hand-holds in the rock face are few and far between. There's a chance of falling into the sea if you are not careful.</p> <p>For a medieval pilgrim, exhausted, starving and in a state of trembling excitement, reaching St Mary's Well was a hazardous venture. But it was a necessity - not simply physically (the well was the source of fresh drinking water at the end of the thirsty journey to the tip of Llyn), but also spiritually. The Blessed Virgin herself had ridden down to the well on her pony when she visited the church of St Mary on the cliffs above; there were the imprints of the pony's hooves, sunk in the rocks around the well for all to see. A sip of the water brought a blessing. Better still if you could hold a mouthful while you ran three times round the church, for then you would be granted your heart's desire.</p> <p>Green weed lines the rim of the cleft, and the sea intrudes into the well at high tide. But the water remains sweet and fresh, a cool and faintly mineral mouthful as you look out, like countless thousands before you, across the tide races of the sound to the green hump of Bardsey, Island of the Saints and Gate of Paradise. </p> <p><strong>- St Mary's Well features in Christopher Somerville's book 'Britain and Ireland's Best Wild Places', see below.</strong></p> <p><strong>KEURN BADENACH, THE CAIRNGORMS<br>NICHOLAS CRANE, EXPLORER, WRITER AND BROADCASTER</strong></p> <p>Some mountains were raised to catch the eye. In the Alps, it is the Matterhorn and Eiger that come to mind. In Wales, I think of that pyramid of rock, Tryfan, looming above the old road to Holyhead. On the pass of Glencoe, I always salute the great prow of Buachaille Etive Mor. Now I've found a new one. It's called 'Keurn Badenach', and it appears on an unpublished sketch map drawn in the late 1500s by the remarkable young Scottish cartographer Timothy Pont. Keurn Badenach is depicted by Pont as a beckoning, spiky finger, right on the edge of his map. Last month, I went with a BBC film crew, to find Keurn Badenach. It didn't take long. Rearing sheer to a mighty 1,000m above the ancient pass of Lairig Ghru, is a peak called 'The Devil's Point'. And on its western flank is the place name 'Buideanach of Cairntoul'. Pont's 'Badenach' is one of the most distinctive peaks in the Cairngorms. </p> <p>We climbed the stony path up from Lairig Ghru as the sun dipped beneath the western mountains. After two hours of huffing, puffing and repeated ascents for the camera, we skirted a great bank of old winter snow and crested the chilly shoulder of Cairn Toul at around 900m above sea level. Tents sprang up on the buffeted turf, and we settled into an evening of filming. It was one of those locations that you can't quite believe. </p> <p>The mountain crests were cast in a restless saffron light, and the enveloping quiet felt like an echo of the earliest days up here, before the first hunter-gatherers came exploring. In the morning, we climbed the stony ramp leading to the summit of The Devil's Point. The view was shockingly immense. </p> <p>In the giddy void below our boots, the silver threads of the Dee and Geusachan Burn writhed past countless lochans, and a golden eagle turned on the updraught. What more could you ask for, before breakfast on a Monday morning?</p> <p><strong> Nicholas Crane's BBC2 series on William Camden's 16th-century masterpiece, 'Britannia', will be broadcast this autumn. </strong></p> <p><strong>ARNSIDE KNOTT, SOUTH CUMBRIA<br>MATTHEW OATES, NATURE ADVISOR, NATIONAL TRUST</strong></p> <p>One of the many hidden utopias of our countryside is the Arnside and Silverdale district, on the Lancashire-Cumbria border. Here, low limestone hills, separated by peatland valleys growing cows or wildlife, lead down to the Morecambe Bay estuary. The region feels like an escaped part of paradise, yet it is bypassed by the hordes heading towards the fells and lakes to the north. Incredibly, Wordsworth never mused here; Silverdale is his unwritten masterpiece. Moreover, painting has yet to flourish here, though the grey rock provides a unique intensity of light. </p> <p>Ecologically, the district lies along the boundary where north and south meet, with plants and animals of the south occurring at the northern limit of their UK range, and vice-versa. The result is a naturalist's dream, though climate change will impact hugely here. The botany is renowned, including local specialists such as the dark red helleborine orchid. It is also a nationally important area for butterflies, notably for the rare high brown fritillary, which abounds here but is elsewhere disappearing, and other fritillary butterflies. </p> <p>The loveliest of these hills is Arnside Knott, a rugged humpback owned by the National Trust between Arnside and the elfin Silverdale. It offers shimmering vistas over the Lakes, while the sunsets across the silvered sands of the estuary are unrivalled. The Knott is an intimate mosaic of scrub, old coppice, rock, scree and the aptly named blue moor grass. It is approached and criss-crossed by footpaths, each of which has its own character though, collectively, they seem to be run by the Ministry of Magic. </p> <p>Once you've visited, part of your soul resides there, in part exchange. It is the still point of the turning world. </p> <p><strong>CHAPEL FELL, YORKSHIRE DALES<br>CAT KILNER, RANGER, DALES PARK AUTHORITY</strong></p> <p>My favourite area in the Dales is a place called Chapel Fell, up on Malham Moor above the village of Malham, in the south west of the National Park. It's an area of open-access land. It actually belongs to the National Trust, though it is tenanted; and although it's not a public area, it is still open to anyone to discover it. The truth is that few people do - you can walk for miles up there and not see another person.</p> <p>I tend to go up there at lunchtimes or after work and sit among the rocks; in spite of the fact that it's quite close to a road, once you are up there you can't see any roads at all and it feels like a million miles from anywhere. </p> <p>It's quite a steep climb up to an area of limestone craggy outcrops and rough pasture and it's actually rather bleak. But I love it because it feels almost primitive; in the winter it looks incredibly desolate, but you can nestle down and get out of the wind among the rocks and just revel in the absolute silence and the fantastic views across to Malham Tarn.</p> <p>It also looks over a nature reserve, so it's a great spot for birdwatching. There are often breeding birds to see - lapwings, oystercatchers and curlews - and occasionally you will see deer. </p> <p>For me, the best time on Chapel Fell is first thing on a winter's morning, against a crisp blue sky. It just looks breathtaking.</p> <h2>ESCAPE PLANS: TOP BOOKS ON AWAY-FROM-IT-ALL-BRITAIN</h2> <p><strong>BRITAIN AND IRELAND'S BEST WILD PLACES<br>by Christopher Somerville</strong><br>The subtitle to this book is '500 ways to discover the wild', and it does exactly what it says on the tin; Somerville has travelled to the most isolated, little-known and unspoilt corners of the British Isles and relates his findings with infectious enthusiasm (Allen Lane, \u00a325)</p> <p><strong>THE WILD PLACES<br>by Robert MacFarlane</strong><br>Intellectual as well as factual, MacFarlane's book sets out to unearth the last wild corners of our overcrowded little island - from bleak windswept moors to the more accessible corners of Dorset and Essex.

  "<p>ITV is facing a backlash from UTV, SMG and Channel Television, the three remaining independent parts of the ITV Network, over its plans to increase the amount it charges them to carry its content. </p> <p>ITV chairman Michael Grade said last week that the channel wanted to abolish a formula that determines the amount they can charge for shows including Coronation Street and Dancing on Ice. ITV argues it is effectively subsidising the smallest parts of the ITV network, because between them they keep 3 per cent of the advertising revenue generated from the shows, but pay only 2 per cent of their cost. It says scrapping the arrangement would save it \u00a325m a year. </p> <p>UTV wants to pay market rates for the programmes, and claims that the amount Ireland's TVE pays for ITV shows suggest their true value is close to \u00a310m.

  "<p>Two war-torn towns deep in the Caucasus yesterday presented mirror images of violence and retaliation. In the Georgian town of Gori, 50 miles from the capital, Tbilisi, buildings burned and scores of bodies lay in the street following a Russian bombardment. A trans-shipment point for Georgian soldiers heading to South Ossetia, by yesterday Gori was coming under sustained Russian aerial attack.</p> <p>As Georgian soldiers fled their base in the town for the fields and woods, it was the civilians who bore the brunt as a bomb hit a block of flats, leaving them to cradle their scores of dead.</p> <p>There are no such photographs yet from Tskhinvali, capital of the separatist enclave of South Ossetia. It was attacked on Friday by Georgia, an assault aimed at wresting back the region of fewer than 100,000 people from de facto independence.

Instead, it was yesterday left to witnesses to describe what had happened, even as Russian troops fought to consolidate their hold after driving the Georgians out of the northern suburbs.</p> <p>'The night before, a Georgian attack was finally repelled,' said Olga Kiriy, a reporter for Russian TV Channel 1 who spent Friday night sheltering with civilians in a basement during the Georgian assault. 'They have left burnt-out tanks. They were firing at us for a long time. The retreating Georgians left a sniper, but the Russian troops have knocked him out. Just now we were shelled again by Georgian Grad missiles.'</p> <p>But amid the chaos, one thing seemed clear - Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's extraordinary attempt to reconquer the separatist region of South Ossetia appeared to be unravelling, as Russian planes bombed ever deeper into Georgia and his troops were sucked into street-to-street fighting.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali - briefly occupied in its entirety by Georgia's US-trained troops - furious fighting was continuing between Russians in the city's north and Georgian forces in the south and centre.</p> <p>And as Georgia's attempt to capture South Ossetia ran into the sand, the country was plunged into chaos as Saakashvili called for a ceasefire, his government declared a state of war and the National Security Council said it might call for foreign military intervention.</p> <p>Meanwhile separatists from Georgia's Abkhazia region also entered the fray, announcing that they had started operations to force Georgian troops out of the disputed Kodori Gorge with aircraft and artillery fire.</p> <p>Georgia's worst nightmare has come true. Russian tanks and armoured cars, packed with soldiers, rolled over the border, through the Caucasus mountains, on to Georgian land, and Russian fighter jets were streaking across the skies.</p> <p>For most people in Georgia, this was a Russian invasion, regardless of the fact that Georgia had initiated the fighting. 'This is an overt, open attempt to destroy Georgia, to bring Georgia to its knees, to put an end to Georgia's independence,' said Saakashvili, in one of a series of televised speeches to his increasingly fearful people. 'Unless we stop Russia, unless the whole world stops it, Russian tanks will go to any European capital tomorrow,' Saakashvili warned. It was a note of desperation.</p> <p>Inevitably it has been civilians who have borne the brunt of the conflict, with both sides levelling accusation of atrocities and ethnic cleansing. </p> <p>What seems beyond doubt is that the Georgian assault that began on Friday - after two weeks of increasingly heavy skirmishes between separatists and Georgian forces - was massive and indiscriminate as volleys of Grad missiles rained down on Tskhinvali and neighbouring villages. </p> <p>Refugees also claimed that civilians were shot, kidnapped and burnt to death by rampaging soldiers in areas occupied by Georgian troops. Russian television has broadcast claims that Georgian troops 'executed' injured Russian peacekeepers based in Tskhinvali who were captured during the initial assault: 10 peacekeepers were killed and up to 150 injured during the rocket and air attack.</p> <p>Among those fleeing was Lusya Khoriyeva, 40, a housewife from Tsunari in South Ossetia, one of an estimated 4,000-5,000 refugees who have arrived in the Russian North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz, in the past two days. </p> <p>'I spent three days in our basement with two of my neighbours,' she said yesterday. 'The Georgians were bombing from the air and with Grad missiles. Then their tanks rolled into the village at 3am on Friday. People shouted, \"Run, run!\" We crawled out of the basement. Our Home Guard fighters were running too: their ammunition was finished. I saw one man hit by a rocket. It took off his head and splattered it against a wall.</p> <p>'We crawled to a field of wheat. A shell landed near me, but did not explode. Another fell in the wheat and set it on fire. My robe was burning. I could hear girls screaming: \"Don't kill me!\" The Georgians were rounding them up. We escaped beyond the field. I came here in a car with 15 people in it. My son, my husband and my daughter are there. I don't know what has happened to them.'</p> <p>Alisa Mamiyeva, 26, an English student from Znaur region, added: 'Georgian soldiers flung open the doors of our houses, marched in and destroyed everything. Women were hiding in barrels of salted cheese to avoid being taken.'</p> <p>Another woman from the same area said: 'They are going from door to door, killing. A few of us escaped in a car but my brother and my aunt and uncle are still there.'</p> <p>Zarema Kochieva, 45, the owner of a small shop in Tskhinvali, managed to flee with her two daughters to Vladikavkaz on Thursday. 'My husband stayed behind to fight,' she said. 'Our men have only automatic rifles against tanks. He told me he ran into our apartment. A Georgian tank saw him and fired at our apartment block, destroying half of it. There are constant firefights. I think my brother may be already dead.'</p> <p>Anatoly Kabisov may not have been the first victim of South Ossetia's dirty little war; it seems certain he will not be the last. But he is emblematic, at least, of how, in a few short days, it spiralled out of control. In a conflict where truth and blame have been hard to determine, how he died represents the complaints of South Ossetia's Russian-speaking separatist movement in the run-up to war. </p> <p>On the night of 1 August, they say, Kabisov, a separatist 'policeman' from the village of Mugat, was killed by Georgian fire from an outpost near the village of Dvani. As his comrades took his body to be buried, Georgians opened fire on the funeral procession as well.</p> <p>Georgia has its own stories to explain the collapse into violence on Friday as the world sat down to watch the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing. The day before Kabisov died, according to Saakashvili, separatists exploded a bomb next to a Georgian police car in the village of Eredvi, wounding six.</p> <p>But if one thing was certain in Tskhinvali before the outbreak of war, it was that separatist leaders and their people were united in one certainty - if Georgia attacked, they would not be deserted.</p> <p>'All we see is Georgia preparing for another war. But we won't be alone,' Boris Chochiev, the rebels' deputy foreign minister warned The Observer before the bombing in Eredvi. 'It would be a war of the Caucasian peoples against Georgia, and Russia would be obliged to protect its citizens. About 98 per cent of South Ossetians have Russian passports.' </p> <p>'Stalin divided Ossetia between the Russia and Georgia, but you cannot split one heart in two,' 76-year-old Lev Valiev said in what was once Tskhinvali's sleepy main square. 'We should be reunited, like Germany was, and that means joining Russia. And if we have to fight for that, it would be the Caucasus versus Georgia.'</p> <p>While the first statement has proved brutally true, the threat of the second is looming as across the Caucasus fighters have volunteered to join on the Russian side. In Chechnya, pro-Kremlin leader Ramzan Kadyrov offered his fighters as unlikely peacekeepers, despite their reputation for kidnap, torture and murder to quell a rebel insurgency. In Abkhazia and Dagestan, other volunteer units were forming, while Cossacks were also flocking to the cause.</p> <p>And it is precisely this that may now be Georgia's greatest problem - that it has unleashed a wave of violent hatred against it across the region.'</p> <p>'The West and Nato back the revanchist policies of Georgia. But in the Caucasus you can't arm one side to the hilt and expect the other side to take it,' Abkhaz foreign minister Sergei Shamba in the separatist capital of Sukhumi, warned before the outbreak of war.</p> <p>For its part, Tbilisi insists there can be no compromise over South Ossetia being part of Georgia. Historically, however, the Ossetians have always been more allied to Russia than those who resisted the expansion of the Russian empire into the area in the 18th and 19th centuries, with many fighting alongside the Russians against neighbours who had long been rivals. Ossetians also allied with the Bolshevik forces when they occupied Georgia in the early 1920s.</p> <p>As the Soviet Union disintegrated and Georgia declared independence, the South Ossetians and Georgians fought over Tskhinvali in a conflict that led to South Ossetia's de facto independence.</p> <p>Since then, a stalemate has persisted in a tiny region where two thirds of the population are separatists, many holding Russian passports, and a third consider themselves Georgians. </p> <p>In November 2006, separatists voted to secede while Georgians voted equally as emphatically to remain. While compromise seemed impossible, it was the arrival of Saakashvili on the political scene that changed the dynamic.</p> <p>One of Saakashvili's promises since becoming president had been to re-integrate South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Georgia. The separatists, he said, could enjoy almost unlimited autonomy - but not independence. It was not enough.</p> <p>'He seems to have flipped,' said James Nixey an expert on the Caucasus at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. 'He has walked into a great bear trap. It is not that he was unprovoked. But it seems he has, in 24 hours, scuppered all the hard work he had put into pursuing Nato and EU membership.'</p> <p>It is precisely this that has acted as the dangerous accelerant, pushing Russia and Georgia ever closer to war.</p> <p>Nixey sees in Saakashvili a man of contradictions. With his fluent English, he appears remarkably Western and cautious, but in his native 'Georgian speaking to other Georgians', Nixey observes, he sounds like a hardline nationalist. 'Even his friends,' he adds, 'see him as something of a loose cannon.' But if Saakashvili - perhaps prodded by advisers who had persuaded him that South Ossetia could be quickly retaken and the Russians fended off by the US - has made a historic mistake, Nixey does not absolve the Russians from responsibility for goading Georgia.</p> <p>'Russia has been waiting for this to happen. They had put enough of a mechanism in place that, if they needed to take over, they could do it very quickly. They have made that clear. They have been making bilateral deals with the \"government\" of Abkhazia, too, over exploration rights and cutting off Georgian exports such as wine and cutting flights.'</p> <p>That phoney war was been swept away by the fierce heat of the fighting as Tskhinvali has crumbled between the two sides. </p> <p>'There is a massive bombardment that has been going on between the city's north and south,' Mikhail Lebedev of Russia Today, told The Observer by telephone not far from Tskhinvali. </p> <p>'It has not been retaken. There are Georgian troops with tanks in the town's centre and Russian forces on their way to meet them. </p> <p>'We were in a village close to the town earlier and saw many civilian buildings destroyed. It looks like a Swiss cheese. The university and hospital have been destroyed. I just spoke to the Russian commander in the town and he says there have been very serious civilian casualties.</p> <p>'Where we are we can see more Georgian troops driving into town. Seven truckloads a few minutes ago. We are anticipating very serious fighting.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>I wouldn't say I showed early promise.</strong> When I was 2 my parents took me to view a flat in west London and I fell down the stairs. My mum picked me up and asked me what happened.

  "<p>The greater part of this box set documents a neglected period in UK rock story: those diffuse years between psychedelia and glam, a time of drift and discovery during which Kevin Ayers recorded four albums for EMI's 'head' imprint Harvest. Listening to the selections included on the first two discs of Songs For Insane Times you can trace an arc from 1967-style carefree innocence to the fundamentally melancholy hedonism of the early Seventies. </p> <p>The lighter side of Ayers is not so far from Donovan. He wrote a string of wistful ditties about faintly aristocratic, 'See Emily Play'-style dream girls ('The Lady Rachel', 'Eleanor's Cake', 'Girl on a Swing'), while the lovely 'May I' presents Ayers as a modern-day courtly lover entranced by a beauty in a cafe, happy just to look but not touch. 'Clarence in Wonderland' offers a LSD-era variation on the classic 'come up and see my etchings' come-on: 'Let's go/ To my chateau/ We can have a good time/ Drinking lots of sky wine.' </p> <p>But only a few years on, 1973's 'Oh! Wot a Dream' offered an elegy for the fading utopianism of Ayers's generation, disguised as a fond tribute to Syd Barrett. In rock bohemia, collective dreams of change were superseded by an ideal of 'decadence'. Which was the title Ayers chose for another paean to a rock icon friend of his, Nico. It's a loving, painfully empathetic portrait of an ice queen 'suffering from wear and tear,' who keeps slipping back into 'liquid night' despite the outstretched arms of her retinue of lovers. Built out of a radiantly rippling wall of tape-delayed guitar, 'Decadence' is one of the most transcendent pieces of rock of its era. Addressing the same topic but as a disturbing self-portrait, 'Song From the Bottom of a Well' combines a jolting noise-scape of guitar-squall with oblique lyrics about the dangers of self-medication and solipsism: this well is full of wine not water, with Ayers happy to drown because he sees 'all the universe as a comfortable bath'. </p> <p>Ayers's sound on the first four Harvest albums was too poppy to be prog but too proggy to really make it as pop, especially when his band was the Whole World: classical composer David Bedford on lava lamp squiggly keyboards, free improviser Lol Coxhill and his parping and tootling sax, frequently amazing guitar from a pre-Tubular Mike Oldfield. The result was marvellously wonky tunes like 'Stop this Train' and 'Shooting at the Moon'. Later, on, as Ayers worked with more straightforward musicians, the gold to lead ratio declines. For example, 'Caribbean Moon' is typically tropical tripe, horribly catchy cod calypso. </p> <p>Later there's just the odd twilight gem, like the punky 'Observations'. Overall, though, the template of chansonnier and backing band generates few sparks. Still, even treading water and going through jaded yet still debonair motions, Ayers never lost his charm. Like an English Lou Reed, he's not, strictly speaking, a good singer, but remains one of the great voices in British music.</p> <p><strong>Download:</strong> 'Decadence'; 'Stop This Train'; 'May I'; 'Shooting at the Moon'</p>",
  "<p>Well, the Chinese can certainly put on a do. At the Olympics opening ceremony, fireworks were blasting about, hither and thither, like some celestial Jean Michel Jarre concert. And did you see that bit where the Olympic logo was hoisted in the air like five giant shimmering Polo mints? Impressive stuff. And all the time. I was thinking: is it too late for us to get out of hosting this borathon in 2012?</p> <p>Is it my imagination or, with the Chinese Olympics barely begun, is everyone already either bored stiff or openly hostile? Every report is about the smog, heat, commercialisation, dope tests, blah. And that's not even starting on the human rights issues; so bad even President Bush feels entitled to have a go.</p> <p>Then there's the great unmentionable - the fact that, whoever the host nation is, the Olympics are always (whisper it) knuckle-chewingly tedious. I keep reading that, this year, there is an estimated global audience of three billion, but who are these people? I don't think I've ever met a person who genuinely cares. Nor can I recall popping around to someone's house, and being told: 'Ssh, damn you - the Olympics are on.'</p> <p>Indeed, no offence to 'Team GB', but does anyone care about discus throwing, swimming, or fencing? Leastways in the relationship-ending way they care when you start up the vacuum cleaner during a penalty shoot out. Though there are exceptions. When Frankie Gavin, the boxer came home in tears for failing to lose a few pounds to reach his target weight, there couldn't have been a woman in Britain who didn't feel his pain.</p> <p>The occasional Olympic event or personality might have caught the public imagination over the years (Daley, Kelly, the rowing champs, Eddie the Eagle). But on the whole, the Olympics are akin to a giant internationally sanctioned parents' race on school sports day, and who wants to watch that? Indeed, the Olympics has to be most boring, sprawling, least loved, most over-produced and expensive sporting tournament ever. And in 2012 it's all ours. It doesn't bode well. People are already complaining about the millions it cost to join the Chinese Olympics. Can you imagine the whingeing when we host the thing? By 2012, the Olympics will have been damned as a 'national folly', like the Millennium Dome, only with javelins. Everywhere, people will be moaning that they never wanted them in the first place. And while much has been made of the Chinese public being ordered to view their Olympics as the 'pivotal moment of their generation', I can't imagine them pulling that off here. Refuseniks and curmudgeons that we are, the British Olympics probably won't even rate as the pivotal moment of the fortnight.</p> <p>That's if we are even ready in time. In place of trillion-dollar opening night firework displays and giant shimmering hoops, one can just imagine the 2012 British version: officials charging around, tipping crisps into bowls at the last minute, giving foreign dignitaries sparklers to write their name in the air. Andy Burnham, or his equivalent, standing in the stadium, watched by billions around the world, red-faced, shouting: 'Someone must know where we put the catherine wheels!'</p> <p>And even if it isn't as bad as that, if our opening ceremony isn't like Abigail's Party with neon, if we do end up with bronze for curling, who can seriously be bothered? Rather than hosting the Olympics I'm sure, like me, the majority of Britons would prefer to do something more rewarding and enjoyable - such as feeding our arms into a giant meat grinder? Indeed, with only four years to go, we should start backing out now, using methods subtle and perhaps not so subtle.</p> <p>It could be like when you've had a couple too many in the pub and start agreeing to horrible hiking holidays with friends, and the next morning you have to ring and say: 'Oh sorry, I just checked the dates, and I can't make it after all. Shame that.'</p> <p>Alternatively, there is still time to offload it onto another country, the same way people in offices always try to get others to do boring tasks under the guise of: 'It's such a great opportunity, but I'm snowed under - do you want to do it? It will get you noticed by the people that matter.'</p> <p>But of course we won't do anything of the sort. The British Olympics of 2012 will happen, and we'll only have ourselves to blame for a daily helping of Sebastian Coe looking insufferably 'busy and important'. Just don't pretend you haven't been warned.</p> <h2>The latest speculation about Madeleine feels like exploitation to keep this sad story going</h2> <p>Dreadful though the thought is, is it time to hope that Madeleine McCann died the night she disappeared?</p> <p>Anything seems preferable to the explanation that she was abducted by a paedophile ring, and is perhaps still suffering. That it was always unlikely that some childless couple just fancied a little British girl, and all this time Madeleine has been enjoying ice cream and piano lessons. In their heart of hearts, the British public probably considered all this the moment Madeleine disappeared.</p> <p>Odd, then, that with the publishing of the case files, the 'paedo-ring' angle has been shoved in our faces as 'breaking news'. What's new about this news? Nothing of course. Just as there seems nothing particularly new about the sightings, some of which seem dubious to say the least. Surely anyone who'd have spotted Maddie, especially in those first feverish weeks, would have locked the door on her and her 'sinister' companions and screamed the place down.</p> <p>Who are these people who muse at their leisure on 'the strange sad blonde little girl' before calling the police? The real McCoy, or the usual attention-seeking nut-jobs - we'll never know. </p> <p>In the grand scheme of things, all this may seem harmless PR padding, but it isn't. The result is that 'Maddie-sightings' are going to end up having the same ring of authority as your bog-standard UFO, Elvis, or Lord Lucan spottings.</p> <p>By the same token, last week's sensational spin on what most of us guessed anyway, has given the case a dramatic unhelpful 'Maddie: the sequel' feel. A background hum of just wanting to keep the story going - to keep selling and exploiting as long as possible.</p> <p>None of which is remotely fair. In real terms the only new development is that the McCanns can feel vindicated at how shabbily the investigation was conducted - which is what they said all along. However, if the speculation turns out to be true, how hollow a victory is that?</p> <h2>Beyonc\u00e9 - irritatingly gorgeous in any light</h2> <p>Has Beyonc\u00e9 been 'white-washed', her skin tone digitally lightened, for those L'Or\u00e9al adverts? Her people and L'Or\u00e9al say not, and looking at the pictures, Beyonc\u00e9's skin doesn't seem so different to the (irritatingly gorgeous) shade I always thought it was. Still, let's face it, when Andie MacDowell was swishing her mane about for 'L'Or\u00e9al, yapping away about how she was 'worth it', you never got people musing that her skin had been made darker.</p> <p>It would be idiotic to claim there's no racism in advertising, that black faces weren't deemed a 'harder sell'. When Vogue Italia published its black model-only issue recently, it merely served to show how much virtually white-only editorial and advertising has been produced over the years.</p> <p>Saying that, I'm not sure this is Beyonc\u00e9's story. Nor for that matter L'Or\u00e9al's, who have a pretty good track record of using ethnic women in campaigns. Nor am I sure it's fair that black women can't opt for slightly lighter skin if they so wish. As things stand, a black female wanting lighter skin is deemed reductive and appalling. Meanwhile, white girls can go darker (with fake tans) any time they like. To clumsily paraphrase Orwell, it would seem that some forms of equality are still more 'equal' than others.</p>",
  "<p>China's winning start to the Olympics was overshadowed yesterday by the murder of a relative of the US men's volleyball coach.</p> <p>A knife-wielding Chinese man stabbed to death Todd Bachman, the father of former Olympian Elisabeth Bachman. He then attacked a Chinese tour guide before throwing himself from the 40 metre-high viewing platform of the Drum Tower, one of Beijing's most famous tourist spots. Mr Bachman's wife, Barbara, was also injured in the early afternoon attack. Elisabeth Bachman is married to US men's volleyball coach Hugh McCutcheon. </p> <p>Such a murderous assault is extremely rare in Beijing, which has a low crime rate compared to most cities of its size.</p> <p>State media identified the killer as Tang Yongming, a 47-year-old native of Hangzhou in the south-eastern province of Zhejiang. His motive is unknown, but local law authorities described him as a lone assailant.</p> <p>The crime put a damper on the festivities, which had come to life after Friday's spectacular opening ceremony and a strong start for the host nation, which won two golds on day one. 'They are deeply saddened and shocked,' the US Olympic Committee spokesman Darryl Seibel said of the volleyball team. He said the two Americans 'were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of the delegation or as Americans'.</p> <p>The crime scene was quickly cleared by police. By mid-afternoon the green gates of the Drum Tower - normally a popular site - were locked. Through the rails all that was visible was a sanded area on the grey tiled floor where bystanders said the police had previously covered a body with a blanket.</p> <p>'I heard a woman screaming and then people running in the direction where the screams came from. It sounded like the screams came from the top of the Drum Tower,' said a foreigner who was in the area.</p> <p>Chinese residents who lived and worked close to the scene of the crime appeared to be under orders not to discuss the incident. 'Why are you paying so much attention to this? Murders happen all the time. You should pay attention to the two gold medals that China won today,' said a middle-aged woman in a flower-patterned shirt.</p> <p>Last night, a series of blasts killed at least two people in China's north-western Xinjiang province, state media reported. It said that sporadic gunfire was heard shortly after the explosions and that two Muslim suspects had been detained. Earlier this week, 16 Chinese policemen were killed in an attack on a border post in the province.</p> <p>Beijing has drafted in an extra 100,000 police and paramilitaries to ensure security at the event, which China hopes to use to highlight its re-emergence as a global power. But sporadic, small-scale protests continue to deflect attention from the sporting spectacle.</p> <p>On the opening day, five pro-Tibet activists draped themselves in Tibetan flags and lay down on Tiananmen Square in protest at the Chinese government's heavy-handed rule in Tibet. They were dragged away by plainclothes police officers. </p> <p>At the start of the equestrian events in Hong Kong, police removed a student from the crowd after she tried to display a Tibetan flag that had been concealed beneath a Canadian banner.</p> <p>Following the precedent set by previous hosts, the organisers in Beijing have established three protest zones. But no one appears to have used them, and two groups of protesters who tried to do so were reportedly either forced to leave Beijing or detained by police.</p> <p>Concerns about human rights violations have been strengthened by the disappearance of activist Zeng Jinyan, who has not been seen since last Thursday when the Olympic torch passed close to her home. Since Zeng's husband, Hu Jia, was jailed earlier this year, she and their eight-month-old baby have been under constant watch by the authorities. </p> <p>In her last blog, Zeng said that she was under extra surveillance before the Games and asked friends to stay away. When The Observer tried to call, her phone was out of service.</p> <p>'All attempts to contact her have failed. It is feared that Zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated,' China Human Rights Defenders said. Another prominent activist, Maggie Hou, has also been out of touch for several days.</p> <p>Human rights disputes and security concerns have taken some of the shine off the lavish celebrations and warm welcome from local people. Before the Games, the organisers forecast that the spectacle would draw 500,000 foreign visitors, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for hotels, restaurants and taxi firms.</p> <p>But a tightening of visa regulations, security concerns and negative reports about pollution appear to have discouraged many people from attending.</p>",

The Kremlin said Medvedev told Bush the only way to end the conflict would be a withdrawal of Georgian forces.</p> <p>The UK's special representative to the South Caucuses, Sir Brian Fall, was this evening attending emergency talks in Georgia with other officials from the US, European Union, Nato and the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). </p> <p>Moscow supports South Ossetia, which has had de facto independence from Georgia since 1992 after a bloody war. Many people in the region have Russian citizenship. Georgia claims South Ossetia as part of its territory.</p> <p>Addressing a televised meeting today, Saakashvili described the conflict as open warfare. \"I have signed a decree on a state of war. Georgia is in a state of total military aggression,\" he said, while calling for \"an immediate ceasefire\".</p> <p>The decree allows for the mobilisation of reservists, among other measures. Georgia says it plans to remove its entire contingent of 2,000 troops from Iraq so they can assist in South Ossetia.</p> <p>Vladimir Boldyrev, the commander of Russian ground forces, was quoted by Tass as saying Russian troops had \"fully liberated Tskhinvali from the Georgian military\".</p> <p>Georgia, which said today it had downed 10 Russian aircraft and destroyed up to 30 tanks, maintains it is holding Tskhinvali. Witnesses in the city said they could only see Russian forces.</p> <p>Russia \u2013 which has confirmed the loss of two planes \u2013 says it first sent tanks and artillery to Tskhinvali to prevent Georgian forces attacking Russian peacekeepers and civilians.</p> <p>Aside from the regional impact, the fighting threatens to increase tensions between Russia and the US. Georgia is a close American ally and Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said the US must bear some of the blame for arming and training Georgian soldiers.</p> <p>Bush, speaking before heading to watch the US women's basketball team in Beijing, said he was \"deeply concerned about the situation\", notably Russia's bombing inside Georgia.</p> <p>\"The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia,\" he said. \"They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis.</p> <p>\"We call for an end to the Russian bombings.\"</p> <p>At the United Nations last night, Russian and Georgian envoys hurled accusations at each other as a divided security council failed to agree on language calling for an end to the fighting. Holding its second emergency meeting in under 12 hours, the council broke off in a stalemate late but was to reconvene today.</p> <p>There are fears of full-blown war in the region, which is a crucial energy transit route in which Russia and the west are vying for influence. </p> <p>In Abkhazia, which declared independence from Georgia but is still claimed by Tiblisi, Sergei Shamba, the region's foreign minister, said its forces intended to oust Georgian forces from the Kodori Gorge. The northern part of the gorge is the only area of Abkhazia that has remained under Georgian government control.</p>",
  "<p>China's winning start to the Olympics was partially overshadowed today by a murder-suicide involving a relative of the US men's volleyball coach.</p> <p>A knife-wielding Chinese man fatally stabbed an American man and his female Chinese tour guide before throwing himself off the 40m-high viewing platform of the Drum Tower, one of Beijing's most famous tourist spots.</p> <p>The dead man's wife was seriously injured in the early afternoon attack - an extremely unusual occurrence in Beijing, which has a low crime rate compared to most cities of its size.</p> <p>US officials identified the dead man as Todd Bachman. His wife, Barbara, was injured. They are the parents of former US Olympian Elisabeth Bachman, who represented the country at volleyball in 2004 and is married to the current US men's volleyball coach, Hugh McCutcheon.</p> <p>State-media named the killer as Tang Yongming, a 47-year-old native of Hangzhou in the south-eastern province of Zhejiang. His motive is unknown, but local law authorities described him as a lone assailant.</p> <p>The crime put a damper on the festivities, which came to life with yesterday's spectacular opening ceremony and a strong start for China today, winning two gold medals.</p> <p>\"They are deeply saddened and shocked,\" the US Olympic committee spokesman Darryl Seibel said of the volleyball team.</p> <p>He said the two Americans \"were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation\" or as Americans.</p> <p>The crime scene was quickly cleared by police. By mid afternoon, the green gates of the Drum Tower - normally a popular tourist site - were locked. Through the rails, all that was visible was a sanded area on the sloping, grey tiled floor where bystanders said the body had lain, covered by a police blanket. </p> <p>\"I heard a woman screaming and then people running in the direction where the screams came from. It sounded like the screams came from the top of the Drum Tower,' said a foreigner who was in the area.</p> <p>Chinese residents who live and work within a few seconds walk from the scene of the crime, appeared to be under orders not to discuss the incident.</p> <p>\"Why are you paying so much attention to this. Murders happen all the time. You should pay attention to the two gold medals that China won today,\" said a middle-aged woman in a floral-patterned shirt. Beijing has drafted in an extra 100,000 police and paramilitaries to ensure security at the Olympics, which China hopes to use to highlight its re-emergence as a global power.</p> <p>But sporadic, small-scale protests continue to deflect attention from the sporting spectacle.</p> <p>On the opening day, five pro-Tibet activists draped themselves in Tibetan flags and lay down on Tiananmen Square in protest at the Chinese government's heavy-handed rule. They were swiftly dragged away by plain-clothes police officers.</p> <p>At the start of the equestrian events in Hong Kong, police removed a student in the crowd after she tried to display a Tibetan flag that she had concealed beneath a Canadian banner.</p> <p>Following the precedent set by previous hosts, the organisers in Beijing have established three protest zones, but nobody appears to have used them. Two groups of those who tried to do so were reportedly either forced to leave Beijing or detained by police.</p> <p>Concerns about human rights violations have been strengthened by the disappearance of activist Zeng Jinyan, who has not been seen since Thursday, when the Olympic torch passed close to her home.</p> <p>Since Zeng's husband, Hu Jia, was jailed earlier this year, she and their eight-month-old baby have been under constant watch by the authorities. In her last blog post, Zeng said she was under extra surveillance ahead of the games and asked friends to stay away. </p> <p>\"All attempts to contact her have failed. It is feared that Zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated,\" China Human Rights Defenders said. Another prominent activist, Maggie Hou, has also been out of touch for several days.</p> <p>Human rights disputes and security concerns have taken some of the shine off the lavish celebration and warm welcome by local people. Ahead of the games, organisers forecast the lavish spectacle would draw 500,000 foreign visitors, generating hundreds of millions of dollars of business for hotels, restaurants and taxi firms.</p> <p>But a tightening of visa regulations, security concerns and negative reports about pollution appear to have discouraged many people from coming.</p> <p>\"It's as though we spent a long time preparing a big feast, and then nobody turned up to eat it,\" said a local taxi driver, as she surveyed the unusually empty roads and complained about the lack of customers.</p>",

  "<p>Given its 5000-year old lethal history, archery began gently in Beijing. Nobody was knocked-out, no hope was dashed, no surprise sprung. Instead, the 128 competitors - 64 per sex - fired 72 arrows each to establish a ranking order for the elimination events - good old head-to-head knock-out - that start tomorrow.</p> <p>Britain's Simon Terry, 16 years after winning team and individual bronze as a 19-year old in Barcelona, announced his return - he drifted out of archery into motor-bike racing and going out with his mates - with a 7th ranking for the men's individual.</p> <p>Alan Wills, 8th in the world order, started well but drifted down to 23rd, while Larry Godfrey, who finished fourth in the Athens individual, was 34th. As a team, Britain are ranked fifth. It's a bit of a numbers game, but nobody is out, just sifted. </p> <p>Alison Williamson, bronze medallist in the women's individual event in Athens, finished in seventh place with a total of 651, the same as Naomi Folkard, ranked 8th. They will face, respectively, Wei Pi-Hsiu of Chinese Taipei, and Soha Abed Elaal of Egypt in the first round of the individual competition on Tuesday.</p> <p>First, though, comes the women's team event, which begins and ends tomorrow. The British trio is completed by Charlotte Burgess, 40th yesterday with 623. Their combined total made them second seeds, with a bye into the last eight of the 10-team event.</p> <p>More important than the bye is what the seeding offers by way of avoidance. It keeps the women away from the Koreans, who underlined their domination - they have won every Olympic gold medal since 1984 - by filling the top three individual places.</p> <p>Park Sung-Hyun, gold medallist four years ago, shot a total of 673, nine points short of her own 72-arrow world record, but equalling the Olympic record of Ukraine's Lina Herasymenko, set in Atlanta.</p> <p>Yun Ok-Hee, world-ranked number one, finished six points behind Park here, with Joo Hyun-Jung three points behind her. Their collective, 216-arrow tally of 2004 broke by ten points their own Olympic record, set in Sydney.</p> <p>To say that Korea pay attention to the detail of archery may be an understatement. At their training camp in Taeneung back home, they rebuilt a perfect replica of Beijing's Court A, the 5000-seat archery stadium, so that their archers might accustom themselves to the proximity of the crowd and photographers.</p> <p>Compare that with the reaction of Alexandra Feeney (59th yesterday), one of Australia's two women archers here: \"I didn't realise there were going to be crowds that close ...\" she had said in the week.</p> <p>In recognition of Korea's pre-eminence, no fewer than 13 countries have coaches from that country, including the British men who have Suk Dong Eun, known as Peter Suk, as their guide. The Korean talent-pool also provides performers: Nami Hakayawa of Japan (ninth yesterday in the women's) and Sky Kim of Australia (14th in the men's) were both raised in Korea.</p> <p>Who might challenge the Korean colossi? Williamson and Folkard established themselves as serious contenders, with Folkard even prepared to sound disappointed with her top-ten ranking: \"I was disappointed with my last end (six arrows). I dropped a few places. My last three ends were bad. Every single arrow was hard work.\"</p> <p>Williamson dashed off her arrows as quickly as ever: \"You can't go for a walk with me,\" she said. \"It has to be a sprint. But when I'm focused and have rhythm, there's no need to wait.\" She's pleased that the team event comes before the individual. \"In Athens, by the time the team competition started, I didn't have much left to give.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere among the challengers, there is a certain Kwon Un Sil who comes from up the road and over the divide, in the People's Republic, which hardly eliminates the word 'Korea.' Kwon lies a lowly 62nd in the world, but finished yesterday ranked fourth, behind Georgia's Khatuna Naraminadze, who might have been forgiven had she had other things on her mind.</p> <p>Natalia Valeeva, who has been to the Olympics under three different flags - as a Moldovan she was selected for the Unified Team in 1992, then Moldova in 1996, before marrying archer Roberto Cocchi from Italy, the country she has represented since Sydney - was tipped to do well here. She won the individual world championship in Leipzig last year and won a World Cup stage this year in Santo Domingo, but could only manage 30th place in the ranking round. </p> <p>Finally from the women's round, a girl. Mariana Avitia is from Monterrey in Mexico and will turn 15 in September. She started archery because she was growing bored with her other sport, speed skating. Ranked 80th in the world she will begin the women's individual competition ranked 20th, with a first round tie on Tuesday against the second woman from the People's Republic of Korea, Son Hye Yong.</p> <p>Korea's men aren't quite as all-consuming as the women. Park Kyung-Mo was their highest-ranking archer yesterday, in fourth place. They win world championships for fun, but can't dominate at the Olympics. Nobody seems to know why.</p> <p>Juan Rene Serrano of Mexico, Mangal Singh Champia of India and the Ukraine's Viktor Ruban, bronze medallist in Athens, fill the top three ranks and give the top of the men's section a broader spread of nationalities.<br>Perhaps the driven Koreans should take a leaf from Terry's book: take a break, go out with your mates, thicken your girth and then start all over again. Nobody seemed to mention to him - nor to Wills, a carpenter, for that matter - that they might knock up a Beijing archery stadium in Grantham.</p>",
  "<p>The impact of the conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in the disputed region of South Ossetia was felt in the Beijing Olympic village yesterday as athletes from the two nations came to terms with news that their countries are effectively at war.</p> <p>As news of the conflict reached the two teams Russia's team leader<br>described the Georgian president as \"mentally ill\" and the IOC was pressed to defend the Olympic truce, broken so spectacularly just as the opening ceremony of the Beijing games took place last night.</p> <p>Russia and Georgia will meet in competition in the women's beach volleyball on Wednesday, but the IOC said that it had no plans to introduce special security measures for the game.</p> <p>Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin attended the opening ceremony in Beijing and met with IOC president Jacques Rogge, but IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said the conflict was not discussed.</p> <p>\"The meeting was very much focused on the sporting agenda, they discussed Sochi [the Russian city hosting the 2014 winter Olympics]. There was no discussion of any political or global incidents,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The sad reality is that out of the nations who were parading last night a number of them are in conflict and in an ideal world it's not something we would like to see. We can only bring the ideals of how sport can bring people together as friends.\"</p> <p>Russian Olympic Committee spokesman Gennady Shvets said that the team had been upset by reports of up to 1,500 deaths, and were following developments closely. He insisted that preparation would not be interrupted, but attacked the Georgian president.</p> <p>\"Our athletes are doing what they've prepared for years. There's no politics.\" Describing Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is backed by Washington, he said: \"He's stupid, a criminal, mentally ill, he should go to a clinic. Normally during the Olympics countries try to calm down any conflicts they have.\"</p> <p>The Georgia team's marketing consultant, Peter Tsanava, said there was no antagonism between the two teams. \"It is a terrible situation when you hear there is bombing going on in your country, and it is a tiny country. Georgians and Russians are both worried,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>\"I live in Moscow but my family is in Georgia right now and I am worried. I hope everything gets better quickly.\"</p> <p>The conflict could yet have implications for Sochi, which is a few hundred kilometres from Georgia's western border. The IOC warned Sochi this week, that it needed to improve several aspects of its preparations. Davies said it was still to early to assess any effect on the Sochi Games preparations.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>01.55am: Well here we are.</strong> We've cooed at the 35,000 fireworks. We've watched Li Ning run along a computer-generated unfolding scroll thing. We've admired the Bird's Nest stadium, kind of absorbed the fact that the No8 is lucky in the Chinese calendar and coughed at the pictures of the smog. And now the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955443/\">Zhang Yimou</a>-directed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china?picture=336347323\">opening ceremony </a> is over, let the Games begin.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>02.15am: This is the place to come </strong>for all the live coverage, blogs, comment and instant response to breaking news. You can also find a handy schedule of today's events (in Chinese time) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/09\">here</a>. No wonder <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/do_i_have_to_cry_at_the_olympi.html\">Barney Ronay</a> is welling up already.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>02.35 am. </strong>The eventing dressage is already under way and Daisy Dick, she drafted in because of injuries to Zara Phillips and Lucy Wiegersma's horses, has already trotted her way to a highly respectable 51.70. (For the equestrian relatively ignorant, the lower the score the better.) FACT: Daisy Dick went to school with our very own <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/like_it_or_not_china_will_play.html\"> Marina Hyde</a>.</p> <p>Later Britain's dressage star in the eventing team, and an individual medal hopeful in his own right, 39 year-old <a href=\"www.foxpitteventing.co.uk\">William Fox-Pitt</a>, who sounds like a character from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4CXY6TVBMc\"> Harry Enfield</a>, but won silver in Athens, has a chance to go one better. </p> <p>At the Beijing Olympics, even the dressage is political. Security officers in Hong Kong removed a university student, Christina Chan, who tried to display the Tibetan flag.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>02:45am: </strong>Equestrian dressage, women's shooting, women's volleyball, basketball and handball are already under way. Indeed, Australia lead Belarus 19-12 at the end of the first quarter in the opening women's basketball pool game. Coming up, we've got bouts of boxing that'll make the fighting in opening ceremony director Yimou's <em>Hero</em> look as menacing as Jimmy Carr. And we've balletically brilliant basketball, swimming, volleyball, fencing, beach volleyball, handball and football, that'll make <em>House of Flying Daggers</em> look like the Friday night lovelies falling out on to the Farringdon Road.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>02:58am: </strong> You do worry that all this week's political breast-beating about how Britain was due a massive medal haul will come back to bite us. It certainly left a bad taste, as <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/zaras_horse_sense_beats_allcon.html\">David Mitchell</a> so astutely pointed out, in the mouth. William Fox-Pitt scored 50.20 which puts him in at the medal unhopeful position, at this early stage, of 11th.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>03:05am:</strong> Seven golds are on offer today, indeed, we're not so far away from the first gold medal \u2013 the women's 10 meter air rifle. China's Du Li is reigning Olympic champion and the overwhelming favourite \u2013 it would mean so much to the Chinese for her to retain her title. IOC President Jacques Rogge is even due at the shooting range hall to present the medals. The whole nation is wanting and willing it... but at the moment she's running fourth but it's too close to call. </p> <p>Ironically, in Athens, the German favourite, Heiner Gabelmann, buckled under the strain of expectation. will the same happen to Du Li? You simply can't imagine the pressure.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>03:10am: </strong>Back to the women's basketball. Australia are beating Belarus 44-28 at half-time. The Athens silver medalists are on course for an easy victory. Next up in Group A will be Mali against New Zealand, you'd expect New Zealand to win that equally comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>03:18am: </strong>We don't have a medal yet, but we do have the first athlete to be sent home for failing a drugs test, Greek sprinter Anastasios Gousis, a 200m semi-finalist in Athens four years ago. The Greek Olympic team has already lost 13 members, with 11 weightlifters, a boxer and swimmer Yiannis Drymonakos withdrawn after positive tests in the past three months.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>03:34am: </strong>After the shooting, the second medal up for grabs is in the Women's 48kg weightlifting final - it's a mixture of snatch and clean &amp; jerk lifting methods, with the best total used to determine the final rankings and medal winners. The Turkish phenomenon that is Nurcan Taylan has just entered the competition, failing at 84KG. Astonishing considering that in Athens she set a then world record of 97.5KG. Next we have a strong Thai contingent, with the home favourite, Chen Xiexia, still to come.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>03:40am: </strong>There's a result in the women's beach volleyball. Norway have beaten Belgium 2-0. I'm struggling to picture beach volleyball in Norway, and in truth both nations count as minnows next to the likes of Cuba, Brazil and the United States. Though, of course, as ever in Beijing you can't discount the Chinese.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>03:54am:</strong> Before the shooting final really warms up, let's have a bit of a results and comment round up. In the women's basketball Australia beat Belarus 83-64. Irish fencer Siobhan Claire Byrne lost to Irena Wieckowska in the first round of the Women's Individual Sabre. Lastly, William Fox-Pitt has blamed his horses nerves, after a last minute judge's inspection on his stomach, for his underwhelming performance. \"I'm disappointed,\" said Fox-Pitt. \"He (Parkmore Ed) is capable of a lot better. He seemed very aware of where the exit was and it was hard to keep him concentrated.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>04:01am: Gold medal - women's 10m air rifle: Katerina Emmons (CZE) </strong></p> <p>There is disappointment for China in the shooting as Du Li has failed in her attempt to retain the women's 10m air rifle title, instead the competition was dominated by Katerina Emmons of the Czech Republic who equalled a world record score of 400 in the qualification round. Lioubov Galkina of Russia took Silver and Snjezana Pejcic of Croatia took Bronze. Du Li had to settle for fifth. Better news for China in the weightlifting though, as Chen Xiexia, is taking the opposition to the cleaners.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>04:12am: </strong>More Beijing beginnings, the men's cycling, featuring Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre of Spain, and runner-up Cadel Evans of Australia, are on their 148.5 mile way. In fact, the whole thing is something of a Tour de China, taking in some of the Great Wall of China, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>04:21am:</strong> Women's handball news. France survived a scare to beat Angola 32-31. I mention this partly because Britain is trying to kick start interest in the sport ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. You can find out more <a href=\"http://britishhandball.worldhandball.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?menuid=1086\">here</a>, just be aware that they want women 5ft 11in or taller and men 6ft 3in or taller. And when I say kick start interest (or whatever the handball equivalent is) I mean they want us to start winning, we're not at the Beijing Games.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>04:30am: </strong> The Olympics is unarguably the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet. For various technological, demographic and political reasons, The Beijing Olympics will probably be the biggest Games ever. Unless you're Sky Sports news, that is. They're focusing on cricket at the Oval (but it's hardly <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/08/theres_no_avoiding_the_pieters.html\">Vic Marks</a>), Arsenal's pre-season victory over Ajax and\u2026 Nottingham Forest V Reading. Presumably, because they don't have the rights, The Beijing Olympics have been erased as completely as Trotsky's name in later editions of John Reed's Ten Days that Shook the World. Strewth.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>04:35am: </strong>Later in the morning, we'll get our first glimpse of several more Brit hopefuls. Rightly-acclaimed poster boy, <a href=\"http://www.benainslie.com/default.asp\">Ben Ainslie</a>, goes for his third consecutive gold medal in the Heavy Weight Dinghy competition. Also worth following will be Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson, who are the criminally unheralded favourites in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/05/olympicssailing.olympicgames2008\">Keelboat </a>(Yngling) class.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>04:55am: </strong>Back to the weightlifting, where we're at the clean &amp; jerk stage. The weights have been disappointing so far - the event kicked off atypically early, around 10.30am Chinese time, and to be blunt you can't just role out of bed and lift one hundred and ten kilos. In the absence of the elephantine weights I was expecting, I've allowed myself to be distracted by the unexpected weightlifting beauty of <a href=\"http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=66114/bio/index.html\">Melanie Noel</a>. However, now Madamoiselle Noel is out, then the quality of competition is more than making up for the lack of World Record breaking activity. Chinese star Chen Xiexia looks in control but the other medal placings are between Korean Im Jyoung-Hwa, the impressive Taiwanese lifter Chen Wei Ling, the Thai Pensiri Laosirikul and rising Turkish talent Sibel \u00d6zkan.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>04:59am: </strong>More from the beach volleyball. Bad news for Swiss fans, the women's team lost 0-2 to China, while the men's team were beaten by the same score by the Netherlands. Hey, maybe Roger Federer will make it all right by routing Russia's Dmitry Tursunov later in the tennis.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>05:09am: Gold medal - women's 48 kg weightlifting: Chen Xiexia (CHN) </strong></p> <p>Chen Xiexia has taken the first Chinese gold of the Games, she made it look easy, and was a country mile ahead of the rest of the field. Second was Sibel \u00d6zkan from Turkey and third was Chen Wei Ling from Taiwan. Next China will get to add to what is certain to be a Midas-ly monstrous haul of golds in the Men's 10m air pistol final.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>05:30am: </strong>We've a grappling chance of a medal in the judo, where Black Country judoka Craig Fallon will be competing in the men's 60kg competition, which is just bouting off now. On paper Fallon looks a shoo in. Except that while he was crowned world champion in 2005, and then European champion in 2006, he crashed out in the second round in Athens. After his defeat at the hands of Revazi Zintiridis, his coach blamed the ref, \"you're not going to get any favours from the referees\" when you're \"in Greece fighting a Greek guy\". We'll see.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>05:41am:</strong> To the gymnasium, where the men's teams are locked in qualifying (team and individual) battle. Italian Enrico Pozzo is currently letting loose on the pole horse, people in the know say it was average, but to my eyes it was extraordinary. The Chinese athletes, of course, have always excelled in this area. Anyone else remember <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5YALP1BdEg\">this?</a></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>05:50am: </strong>In the second women's basketball match New Zealand are following the winning example of neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours Australia, they're leading Mali 42-33 at half-time.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>06:05am: </strong>One of the nicest stories from out of the leftfield of the Athens Olympics was the silver medal of photogenic badminton mixed doubles pair Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson. Well, the singles tournament is already underway. Pick of the games so far was Indonesian Maria Kristen Yulianti staging a late fightback to beat German hopeful Juliane Schenk in a superb three setter. The Chinese top seeds Lin Dan (male) and Xie Xingfang (female) play tomorrow. Athens quarter finalist Tracey Hallem and rising male hopeful and world no.20 Andrew Smith provide the home challenge. In Guardian land, I need to beat Phil Passey to stay in the Premier League on Tuesday.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>06:14am: </strong>If you're wondering quite why we haven't had that glimpse of Ben Ainslie going for his third gold in the sailing yet, or why I haven't given you more on Yngling favourites Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson, it's because the sailing events have been delayed. Meantime Team GB rower, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/counting_down_the_hours_till_r.html \">Richard Chambers</a> shares his experience of preparing for a big Olympic day on the water.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>06:18am:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympics2008.olympicsshooting1\">Lawrence Donegan</a> reflects on how Katerina Emmons upset the formbook and overcame a headache, and the will of a billion odd Chinese people, to beat local hero Du Li, to the first gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>06:20am: </strong>More on the lack of the scheduled sailing competition, it's apparently nothing more sinister than a lack of wind. It's just a postponement at Qingdao \"one of the most windless places on the planet\" and maybe not the first we'll see.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>06:30am:</strong> It's not that much of an exaggeration to say that Craig Fallon had no sooner begun his fight with Monaco's unfancied Hann Siccardi, than he beat him. Our Black Country boy is comfortably through to the second round. Good job.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>06:35am: </strong>More results and news for your delectation. In the women's beach volleyball the Australians beat the Russians 2-1, while New Zealand eventually closed out Mali in the women's basketball 76-72. Meanwhile, Qingdao is getting gusty and the sailing is starting up.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>06:47am: </strong>Back to the pommel horse. Huntingdon-based hopefuls Louis Smith and Daniel Keatings have finished their routines - both hope to make the individual final but the exciting 19 year-old Smith made several minor errors while teammate Keatings' spoiled a fine effort by losing his balance as he dismounted. Despite all the huff and puff about it being a learning experience for London in four years time, they'll be disappointed if they fail to make the final. Fingers crossed. Better news comes from the cycling, where 19 year-old Brit Johnny Bellis is handily placed as they approach the Great Wall of China.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>07:04am: </strong>Lack of wind or no, Ben Ainslie has made a storming start in the dingy and has cut his way through the fleet with only Croatia's Ivan Kljakovi\u0107 Ga\u0161pi\u0107 keeping in touch. Less good news in the Yngling, where the British team were trailing in last, and despite picking up, have it all to do in the downwind half of the first race.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>07:17am: </strong>James DeGale, the only Team GB boxer in action today, is going into the fourth round against Egypt's Mohamed Hikal in the opening round of the middleweight division. Sad to say, the Hammersmith boy is in bother. Frankie Gavin debacle aside, you gotta trust <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympicsboxing.olympics2008?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=sport\">John Rawling</a>, that things will turn around for the British boxing team.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>07:20am: </strong>Bored by the news that Katerina Emmons won the first Gold in Beijing? <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/after_32_minutes_beijing_2008s.html\">Andy Bull </a>follows the first loser, Australian badminton hopeful Erin Carroll, gone in 30 odd minutes.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>07:24am: </strong>He lost the first round or so, but boxer James DeGale triumphed 13-4 over Mohamed Hikal of Egypt in the end. Welcome good news.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>07:38am: </strong>The wind has dropped again in the sailing, and with it Ben Ainslie's command of the field in this first race. Charismatic Greek, Emilios Papathanassiou, has overhauled both Ben Ainslie and Ivan Kljakovi\u0107 Ga\u0161pi\u0107 to lead by a distance. In fact, a fair few have sailed past our man Ainslie including America, Brazil and Poland. He finished tenth, a dramatic collapse after the wind died.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>07:46am: </strong>It's second round misery again for Craig Fallon, he's lost his second round match against European champion Ludwig Paischer from Austria. And doubling the unhappy Athens deja vu, Fallon didn't have the rub of the green from the referee either. Bronze is now the best he can do.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>07:56am: </strong>The cycling is cracking on - with Stefan Schumacher, a two-stage winner in this year's Tour de France, currently setting the pace. Sadly, there's not going to be a fairy tale for the teenage Brit Johnny Bellis, who's fallen away. From young hopeful to grizzled veteran, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/longo_joins_elite_group_of_sev.html \">William Fotheringham </a>pays tribute to seven-time Olympian Jeannie Longo who rides in the women's race tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>08:08am: </strong>It's 8am, which means that it's time for Lutz, Tom Lutz. But before I handover, let me bring you up to date with some of the non-Brit action. In the women's handball Hungary beat Sweden 30-24. In the women's beach volleyball their have been wins for China and Italy. And lastly, but not leastly, China are up in their basketball game with Spain. Should be a close game, that. And now talking you through the last five medals of the first day it's Mr Lutz.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>8.15am: </strong>Oh, hello. A few zingers coming up later today. We've got a shooting medal to be decided in the next few minutes in the 10m air pistol final and the there'll be more slashing than in a horror movie double bill later as the women's sabre medals are decided.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>8.18am: </strong> Big news at the beach volleyball courts where George Bush has stopped by to ogl\u2026 support the US women's team as they practise ahead of their campaign.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>8.24am </strong> China's Pang Wei is destroying the competition in the men's 10m air pistol. He's going to have to shoot one of the judges, or George Bush on the beach volleyball court if he's going to stuff it up at this point. He looks disappointed as his first shot goes just wide of the centre, but it's good enough to secure the gold. <strong>Two golds for China then</strong>, only 563 more to go.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>8.28 am: </strong> Medals from 10m air pistol final: <br>Gold: Pang Wei (China)<br>Silver: Jin Jong-oh (South Korea)<br>Bronze Kim Jong-su (North Korea)</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>8.38am :</strong>You'll want to know about the men's road race, won't you? Kuschyinski from Belarus/NOT BRITAIN and Pidgornyy from Ukraine/NOT BRITAIN are about 90 seconds ahead of the peloton. There's still an hour and a half to go though, so plenty of time for them to be caught.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>8.40am - Sportsman you might have heard of watch: </strong>Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre is back in the peloton minding his own business, ready to make his move.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>8.47am: </strong>Britain's Alan Campbell wins his single sculls heat and is through to the quarters.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>8.54am: </strong>Sean Ingle has been wandering around Beijing inhaling huge lungfuls of not-as-polluted-as-it-once-was air and come to the conclusion that <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/humidity_is_the_athletes_enemy.html\">it's the humidity that will harm athletes</a>, not the pollution. The women's archery team is through to the final and, like Henry Kelly in his heyday, will be going for gold tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>9.02am: </strong>Our man Fallon battles it out for the chance of a bronze. His opponent is Morocco's Ahamdi. Fallon, by the way, sports a jaunty bandage round a cut over his left eye, which gives him a rather piratical air. All the judo kids will be wearing it come September, trust me. Gah! That cut has turned into a spurting geyser now and the doctor's on. Fallon is up 11-0 though.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>9.03am: </strong>And Fallon is through. He ground out the last seconds of the fight and his bronze dreams are still alive.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>9.12am: </strong> The NOT BRITISH breakaway pack are being hauled in by the peloton in the men's road race, their lead is now just over 40 seconds. The Olympic champion Paolo Bettini from NOT BRITAIN has dropped back after a puncture.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>9.17am: </strong>\"Who leads the cycling road race,\" asks Gary Naylor. \"I've always found it amusing watching how the trade team alliances (and potential contracts for next year) count for rather more than the Olympic ideal. But that's the deal with cycling - a rare sport that started not as an amateur pastime, but as a professional sport.\" It's Ukraine and Belarus out front, which is a kind of alliance, in that they're a quite close to each other \u2013 and better mates than say, ooh, Georgia and Russia.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>9.19am: </strong> Ben Ainslie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/15/smalltalk.sportinterviews\">who I once put some pretty tough questions about killer whales to</a>, has won his second race in the sailing.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>9.28am: </strong>Bettini is making a comeback in the cycling and is towards the front of the peloton. The Spaniards are packed together and looking ominous.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>9.31am: </strong>Craig Fallon is up against Kim in the judo. Two more victories and he's got the bronze. And the BBC feed disappears as they clash fort he first time. Fantastic.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>9.37am: </strong>Ah, good work. We're back on the judo and Fallon's stopped bleeding too. He's 100-0 up for a half-ippon, which is kind of like half knocking someone out.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>9.43am: </strong>Kim should just punch Fallon repeatedly in the eyebrows \u2013 Fallon's fatal flaw, along with Austrian judokas is his easily cut brows - if he wants to win, but he's an honourable opponent and Fallon scraps out the win. Two more victories and he'll have the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>9.46am: </strong>The NOT BRITISH leading pair have been enveloped by the NOT BRITISH chasing pack. The Spaniards are still sticking together and a NOT BRITISH Austrian cyclist has decided to go on a solo break.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>9.52am: </strong>Yep, the Austrian - Pffenberger - is starting to tire and the chasing pack closes in.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>9.56am: </strong>Bettini has fallen back into the pack with 21km to go. Cadel \"Fun\" Evans is frowning his way into a promising position, but the Spaniards are working together and that could be crucial.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>10.03am: </strong>\"Back in the days of Grandstand and Sportsnight, the BBC would occasionally further our education by covering minority sports and most welcome it was (except dressage),\" says Gary Naylor. \"Now, the BBC barely bothers with sport at all outside Wimbledon, The Open and set pieces like The Olympics and The World Cup. Sky and Eurosport do a decent job but people only buy Sky for the football and possibly the cricket. So - my question - is there anyone with terrestrial TV only who recognises any of the competitors or has seen any of these sports since the last Olympics?\" You obviously missed the Cash In The Attic Modern Pentathlon Special where they discovered the stuffed body of the horse used to win the 1912 Olympics, hidden in an attic in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>10.05am: </strong>In the cycling, Schleck attempts to get away from the pack, but he's reeled back in.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>10.12am: </strong>Our cheap gimmick of the Games, involves you, the reader, pitting your wits against a betting rat.

Rebellin, Sanchez and Schleck of Italy, Spain and the Netherlands respectively lead the road race by 15 seconds and if they work together should, <em>should</em> share the medals.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>10.19am: </strong>The leading pack's lead is down to eight seconds. Yikes!</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>10.21am: </strong>Switzerland's Cancelerra is storming towards the leading group and has caught them, Mick Rogers of Australia follows them.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>10.24: </strong> Rebellin, Sanchez, Schleck and Rogers are all together as they come towards the line, but Samuel Sanchez sprints ahead to secure gold for Spain.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>10.26amResults from the men's cycling road race: </strong><br>Gold: Samuel Sanchez (Spain)<br>Silver: Davide Rebellin (Italy)<br>Bronze: Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland)</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>10.34am: </strong>Britain's Matt Wells and Stephen Rowbotham are through to the semis in the men's rowing doubles. While the men's four have just got away in the heats. After 1.3 metres they're in a miserable fourth place. Pathetic.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>10.37am: </strong>Brilliant recovery, they're up into first after 1km.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>10.38m: </strong> Britain \u2013 sporting that trusty rowing combination of floppy hair, double-barreled names and good jaws \u2013 still lead after 1,500m ahead of the Italians.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>10.40am: </strong>Britain ease home in the men's four in first place. Top hair-flopping, boys.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>10.48am: </strong> Holland take the second heat, just ahead of the Kiwis whose hair is just not foppish enough for my liking. Ireland are up in heat three against Australia, who are pretty handy, by all accounts.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>10.52am: </strong>Horrific news from Beijing where a US tourist \u2013 a relative of one of America's volleyball coaches \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympics2008.china2\">has been killed by a Chinese man</a>, who then committed suicide.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>10.57am: </strong>With the inevitability we've come to know and love/read from the Aussies, they take heat three of the men's four, with the Germans and Ireland trailing in second and third.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>11.11am: </strong>The swimming will start at 11.30am, so I'm off to rummage through the Guardian's bins for something to eat. Will be back shortly with a mouldy pork pie and the start of Michael Phelps's world domination.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>11.24am: </strong>Fallon's back on against in the judo and has just scored his first point, then follows it up with a wizari (a half-knockout type thing). If he wins this he's fighting for bronze.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>11.25am: </strong>Yekutiel of Israel hits back with a wizari of is own, and then follows up with an ippon. Come in, Craig, <strong>your Olympics are over</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>11.32am: </strong> Now, no one's sorrier for young Craig than myself, apart from maybe his family, the people of the Black Country, his dog Pelforth, bandage manufacturers, the Britsh Olympic team and Craig himself, but it does mean that we can concentrate ont he swimming without having to flick over/guess when the judo's goig to come through on the web feed.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>11.35am: </strong>An email that's not from Gary Naylor, about Gary Naylor or referring to his Naylorship: \"Just as well as the Olympics are taking place in Beijing,\" says Karlo Thornbury, assuming I'm in Beijing rather than a bunker in Farringdon. \"If you were in Rome, your bin rummaging might land you in the slammer, courtesy of a new mayoral bye-law (See yesterday's Guardian).\" I don't read the Guardian Karlo, I'm more of a Daily Mail man.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>11.39am: </strong>Tom Haffield is up in the men's 400m individual medley. He's only racing the world champion, so should be a shoo-in.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>11.44am </strong>Haffield turns for the last leg (freestyle) in seventh and ends up in exactly that position. Don't expect him to be having a wee cry on the podium as they belt out God Save The Queen any time soon.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>11.49am: </strong>South Korea's women's basketball team have beaten Brazil in an overtime thriller 68-62.

Michael Phelps is up next.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>The Perils Of Opening Up Your One Party State To The Outside World Dept:</strong> low-quality trance booms round the water cube as Michael Phelps breezes through his heat.

Under 58 seconds and they're in with a chance of progressing. Halsall is third at the turn, with Lowe in fourth. They end up fourth (Lowe) and fifth (Halsall), that's good enough for Lowe to make the semis, Halsall will miss out.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>12.16pm: Results for the women's 48kg judo</strong><br>Gold: Alina Alexandra Dumitru (Romania) <br>Silver: Yanet Bermoy (Cuba)<br>Bronze: Ryoko Tani (Japan)</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>12.27pm: </strong>By the way, if you want to read about Britain's archers' success this morning, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympicsarchery.olympics2008\">click here</a>, for more on Craig Fallon's woe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympicsjudo.olympics20081\">click here</a> and for William Fotheringham's analysis of the cycling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympicscycling.olympics2008\">click here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>12.29pm: </strong>In the gymnastics, Britain's Louis Smith is fourth after two thirds of the pommel horse qualification, and Daniel Keatings is eighth. However, Keating's almost certain to drop out as the Romanians and Koreans have their crack at qualifying this evening. Better news for Keatings is that he's sixth in the all-round event, so could cling on for a place in the final there. If either Smith or Keatings reach the final, some grizzly old hack who looks like he knows a thing or two reckons it'll be the first time a British male has ever done so in Olympic gymnastics.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>12.33pm: </strong> Dean Milwain finishes down in seventh in the men's 400m freestyle.

Hackett's had a shoulder injury, and starts off well, but is reeled in by Vanderkaay of the US, before a late burst sees him edge out the American into second. Carry puts in a British record as he finishes fifth - it's not good enough for a place in the final, sadly.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>12.54pm: </strong>Keri-Anne Payne and Hannah Miley are competing for Britain in the women's 400m medley.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>1.06pm: </strong> Keri-Anne Payne goes in lane six in the third heat.

She may not make the final if the last heat is a fast one.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>1.17pm: </strong>Word-record holder Katie Hoff goes in the final heat against Hannah Miley, the other races have been pretty fast, so Miley will need to get in Hoff's slipstream if she's to have a chance.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>1.18pm: </strong>Miley is in second place at 150m...</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>1.19pm: </strong>... and at 200m.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>1.21pm: </strong>Hoff takes control at 300m and is a second in the lead ahead of Miley.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>1.22pm: </strong> Miley finishes in Hoff's wake, but it's good enough for her to record the eighth fastest time overall. We'll see her in tomorrow's final.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>1.25pm: Results for the women's sabre</strong><br>Gold: Mariel Zagunis (USA)<br>Silver: Sada Jacobson (USA)<br>Bronze: Becca Ward (USA)</p> <p>Conclusion: don't get into a sword fight in America.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: </strong>There's been some pretty pacy heats in the men's 100m breaststroke, so Britain's Chris Cook is going to have his work cut out. And he duly finishes in fourth, should be good enough to get into the semis.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>1.49pm: </strong>Kris Gilchrist is next up for Britain in the 100m breaststroke. Gilhrist's more of a 200m specialist, he finishes in seventh and won't make the semis. Cook, however, will. That was a ridiculously quick set of heats and Cook did very well to qualify 15th fastest.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>1.52pm: </strong>Last race of our kind-of-five-minute-delay coverage. Britain go in the women's 4x100m freestyle. Britain finish the first leg in first place.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>1.53pm: </strong>Britain are second after 250m...</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>1.55pm: </strong>... but they fade as the Chinese surge into first. Britain end in fourth place - they record a British record too - and will have to wait for the second semi-final to see if they come back again tomorrow.</p>"
