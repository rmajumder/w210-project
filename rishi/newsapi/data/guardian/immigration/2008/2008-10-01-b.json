  "<p>It's the last thing anyone would expect to find looming at the end of a cart track leading from a north Cumbrian village \u2013 a entire farm wrapped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/feb/01/art.usa\">Christo</a>-style in plastic sheeting and baler twine.</p> <p>The 18th-century Croft Farm, nestling under the fells in the Eden Valley, has been transformed into a black, glistening art-work called Wrapped Up as part of the cutting-edge environmental art festival, Fred, which has invaded 110 far-flung locations in Cumbria and parts of Lancashire, with work by 45 artists.</p> <p>The work of encasing the farm in plastic has been carried out by Edinburgh-based artist Ettie Spencer, whose parents used to farm the 120-acre hill farm. Now that her father has died and her mother is in a home in the south of England, Spencer sees the act of wrapping up of family business as not just the symbolic end of a personal era, but also a way of highlighting the plight of Cumbria's dwindling number of hill farms.</p> <p>\"Most of us live in urban areas,\" points out Spencer. \"Hill farming is no longer profitable and it could easily slip through our fingers without us noticing. The role of artists is to flag up issues and be assertive.\"</p> <p>This fifth \u2013 and last - annual art invasion of Cumbria by Fred contains another work highlighting the same issue. A few miles south in Kirkby Stephen, UK artist Christopher Collier has \"planted\" 100 pairs of upturned Wellington boots each representing a defunct hill farm.</p> <p>Fred is the inspiration of sculptor Steve Messam, who moved to a Pennine-top spot outside Kirkby Stephen eight years ago and decided to create a gallery without walls, as an alternative to the London-centric, gallery-based mainstream art world.</p> <p>This year, participating artists are from China, USA, Latvia and Germany, but most are from Cumbria or the north-west of England. One artists' collective has moved the Scottish border to a location two miles south of Carlisle via a sign visible from the M6, to symbolise the area's boundary disputes.</p> <p>Not all the work is political. A community-owned petrol station in Broughton-in-Furness has been transformed into a \"poetry station\" dispensing odes and stanzas at the pumps for customers.</p> <p>Many of the works are difficult to access, like Messam's own work in Scales Tarn, half-way up Blencathra mountain, to provide an intermittent ripple in the lonely mountain lake, visible only to those prepared to don their rucksacks and tackle the fells. At busy times on Sharp Edge above the tarn, 50 visitors an hour look onto Messam's work \u2013 good going for any city gallery.</p> <p>Messam admits to have to climb many hurdles with environmentalists, Health and Safety staff and even archaeologists to ensure the safe assembly and removal of some of the exhibits for the two-week duration of the festival, funded through the Northern Rock Foundation, South Lakeland district council, Arts Council England and the PRS Foundation.</p> <p>\"People have always used Cumbria as a way of developing new ideas, \" said Messam. \"You can get bogged down in the city. It's difficult to move yourself in original ways.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Fred is at 110 locations in Cumbria and Lancashire until October 12. Some exhibits will be at Scope International art fair at Lords Cricket Ground, London from October 16 to 19.

  "<h2>Tribute to bravery of banker killed in attack</h2> <p>A senior banking executive who was set upon after confronting a gang died from bleeding to the brain, police said yesterday. Taxi drivers at the rank in central Norwich near where father-of-two Frank McGarahan, 45, suffered fatal injuries in the early hours of Sunday left a bouquet at the scene paying tribute to his bravery. Last night a 21-year-old man was charged with assaulting McGarahan's cousin, who was with him on the night out before a family christening. Magistrates gave police extra time to question two other local men in connection with McGarahan's death.<br><strong>Rachel Williams</strong></p> <h2>Rare public viewing for Stonehenge warrior's gold</h2> <p>The gold treasure of a bronze age warrior made a rare return yesterday to the small museum which has owned it for 200 years - then went straight back to a bank vault. The Bush Barrow gold, from the richest bronze age grave excavated in Britain, a burial mound near Stonehenge, was last seen in public 24 years ago. It is too valuable for the Wiltshire Heritage museum to keep in its building in Devizes. On October 25 and 26, to mark the bicentenary of its discovery, the museum will show the gold with the rest of the finds for two days. It came out of the bank this week so curators could finalise the display.<br><strong>Maev Kennedy</strong></p> <h2>Biggest illegal trawler net seized off Devon</h2> <p>One of the largest illegal fishing nets ever found in the UK has been seized off Plymouth Hoe, Devon, by the Environment Agency. The plastic mesh net, stretching 900 metres (more than half a mile) and set about three metres under the sea's surface, was used for \"ghost fishing\" - once set by the trawlers, left to catch indiscriminately. \"They are very destructive, they trap all sea life including dolphins, seals and turtles,\" said Emma Snowden, of the Marine Conservation Society. Fish caught in the net, such as sea salmon and trout, would be destined for illegal markets, said the agency.<br><strong>Steven Morris</strong></p> <h2>BBC4 controller Hadlow to take over at BBC2</h2> <p>The BBC4 controller, Janice Hadlow, was named the new controller of BBC2 yesterday. Hadlow, who has built a reputation for intelligent and entertaining television on a tight budget at the digital channel in her four years at the helm, will take over from Roly Keating next month. \"Janice is an outstanding original thinker who has led BBC4 from strength to strength,\" said the director of BBC Vision, Jana Bennett. Keating, who is moving to a new role overseeing the corporation's drive to build a digital archive, was considered to have done a good job in reinvigorating BBC2.<br><strong> Owen Gibson</strong></p> <h2>Plan to publish level of animal pain in lab tests</h2> <p>More information about the level of pain and suffering animals endure during lab experiments should be made public, according to a group of scientists advising ministers on how to change regulations governing animal research. They say the change - which was cautiously welcomed by animal rights campaigners - will make animal research more transparent and improve experimental procedures to minimise suffering. The results will form part of annual statistics on the number of animals used in research. Last year 3.2m procedures were carried out, the majority (83%) on rodents.<br><strong>James Randerson</strong></p> <h2>Police appeal after crane is stolen from layby</h2> <p>A 14-metre (45ft) crane was stolen from a layby on the A10 near Harlow in Essex with the 18-metre trailer on which it was lying, police said yesterday. The crane and trailer were due to be picked up on September 25, when it was found to have been stolen. Police believe the yellow Broshuis trailer and blue JIB crane section were stolen between 8pm last Wednesday and 7am last Thursday. They have appealed for witnesses who may have seen it being driven on the A10 or M25. Scotland Yard said: \"The offenders may have taken the property on to the M25 due to its sheer size and weight.\"<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Former royal butler guilty of sexually abusing boys</h2> <p>A former royal butler is facing jail for sexually abusing boys, one of whom he brought to the Queen Mother's Christmas party at Clarence House. Paul Kidd, 55, of Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, admitted a series of charges from 1975 to 2006 at Manchester's Minshull Street crown court, including indecent assault and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was arrested when a victim saw a newspaper interview with him. Investigations led to the arrest of a second man, David Hobday, 56, from nearby Dukinfield, who pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a child. Sentencing is on November 20.<br><strong>Helen Carter</strong></p> <h2>Seven detainees escape through service duct</h2> <p>Police were last night hunting seven men who escaped from Oakington immigration detention centre in Longstanton, Cambridgeshire, by crawling through a metal service duct and cutting a fence. Four, believed to be Vietnamese, broke out on Thursday and Friday. They were being detained for possessing forged documents and offences related to the production of cannabis. Three others escaped on Sunday, a Home Office spokesperson said. They are not believed to be dangerous. The UK Border Agency said razor wire and patrol dogs have since been deployed at the former RAF base. <strong>Martin Hodgson</strong></p>",
  "<p>Europe's mission to replace Russian forces inside Georgia began modestly yesterday when the first EU armoured vehicles began patrolling inside the so-called buffer zone next to Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia.</p> <p>After negotiations with Russian troops, two EU vehicles slipped past their checkpoint at the village of Karaleti yesterday morning. They spent 90 minutes touring villages occupied by Russian forces before returning to Georgian-controlled territory. This symbolic outing by a handful of French military policemen, unarmed but wearing dark blue berets and EU armbands, marked the beginning of the EU's deployment in four regions of Georgia.<br><br>It was not clear whether the EU's arrival means Russia will now pull out. Under a revised agreement between France's President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev, Moscow has until October 10 to remove its military from generous buffer zones next to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Last night Medvedev indicated Russia would leave on time. \"Russian peace-keepers will be withdrawn from Georgia within the agreed dates,\" he said. Hansj\u00f6rg Haber, EU mission head, said: \"The process has begun. We are entering the adjacent areas. This is the beginning of the takeover.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, however, there was no evidence of a Russian withdrawal. Troops at Karaleti, 5km north of the city of Gori, in central Georgia, stopped and searched Georgian civilian vehicles. The Russian flag flew above a roadside camp.</p> <p>Residents in the buffer zone, most of whom fled during August's brief war between Russia and Georgia, said South Ossetian paramilitaries continued to rampage in the area. The militias burned down houses belonging to ethnic Georgians, kidnapped civilians and stole cattle, they said.</p> <p>\"The Russians are not doing anything to stop this. They are just standing around,\" Givi Goligashvili, 68, told the Guardian, riding his donkey cart to the buffer zone village of Garejvari. \"The Ossetians are taking all the cattle from the villages and making the Georgians leave. The Ossetians are now the rulers here.\" </p> <p>Giuli Kasradze, 53, from Ergneti, said: \"If the Europeans and the Georgian police are in position, we will go back.\" She showed photos on her mobile phone of her gutted two-storey home, saying Ossetian paramilitaries had burned it down, returning on Monday and setting fire to the last 12 houses in the nearby village of Disevi.</p> <p>Aid workers yesterday said the region's refugee problem would be largely solved if the Russians left. Some 12,000 displaced residents who fled the conflict are camping out in Gori - 2,200 of them in a well-organised tent city on a central sports field. Another 37,000 are staying in Tbilisi.</p> <p>\"Ninety per cent are from the buffer zone. As soon as the Russians withdraw we expect the vast majority to go back,\" said Stefano Berti, the UN refugee agency's head of field operations in Gori. He added: \"The mere presence of EU monitors helps. It gives the impression that the international community is here.\"</p> <p>The Kremlin has given ambiguous signals about possible restrictions on the movements of the 323-strong EU force, which includes monitors from the UK. On Tuesday Russian officials hinted that the EU would not be allowed into the buffer zone. Yesterday Russian soldiers at Karaleti said this was mere western mischief-making.</p> <p>\"As you can see, the EU came here, no problem,\" a Russian officer standing at the Karaleti checkpoint told the Guardian, as French and Polish monitors began an afternoon patrol. \"To suggest otherwise is to make a sensation.\" Asked when he intended to leave, he said: \"We'll do everything in accord with the agreement.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>On August 8, Georgia made an ill-fated attempt to recapture the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia responded by sending in tanks, defeating Georgia's army and occupying areas of Georgia beyond. Last month Russian president Dmitry Medvedev agreed to a French-brokered truce, under which Russia has to pull its forces out of the \"buffer zone\" adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a second breakaway province, by October 10. The zone has seen killing, looting and ethnic cleansing by South Ossetian militias.</p>",

Actually, don't bother answering that, it's quite simple. They had some singles, had some troubles, went away for a time are now back with a new single and album.</p> <p>I mean: What happened to them in the <em>meantime</em>? Do you think their new video will tell us? I don't know. Let us have a look.</p> <p>Well, from the looks of things, they seem to have been to the 80s - or, more specifically, travelled to what they thought the future would be like in the 1980s, perhaps even to the set of Duran Duran's Wild Boys video ...

  "<p>People who say that political parties are now all the same didn't spend the past three weeks at party conferences. Some of the components are reliably consistent - the warm lunchtime chardonnay, the crumpled fringe meeting leaflets, the bars that never seem to close. \"It's a bit like freshers' week, isn't it?\" laughed a TV executive in Manchester - and that's exactly what it feels like. \"Quite exciting, but quite stressful,\" he added. \"You keep thinking, am I having a good time? Or do I actually want to go home now? You never feel quite sure if people like you or not. And you keep wondering if you're missing something better going on somewhere else.\" </p> <p>Tony Benn said they seemed to be taking place without reference to politics - and in a way he was right too. \"They've managed to veto politics for about a month, haven't they?\" he smiled wistfully. \"They've just discussed Gordon Brown. Conference has become a ministerial press conference, in the middle of a trade fair.\" </p> <p>But for all the expensively choreographed stage management, and the corporate gloss, and for all the good intentions of the party faithful, the remarkable thing about each conference was how perfectly it told the truth. The season began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and closed with the collapse of the US bail-out bill, but even a crisis of global capitalism couldn't quite divert or disguise which way power and the parties are going. </p> <h2>Liberal Democrats, Sept 13-17</h2> <p>There was something unwittingly fitting about the Lib Dems' destination this year. The seaside had been abandoned by both other parties in favour of metropolitan heartlands, leaving the Lib Dems perched on the cliffs of the south coast - a cruelly peripheral metaphor. Under cloudless blue skies, delegates wearing backpacks ambled along the promenade in Bournemouth eating ice creams, indistinguishable from the late-summer surfers and holidaymakers of an English seaside town. </p> <p>Under normal circumstances, looking normal should be a good thing in politics. Looking young is usually another advantage, for one of the measures by which a party can be judged is the age of the members it attracts. I was in Bournemouth with the Tories in 1998, one year into their wilderness, and their conference looked like a daytrip for inpatients from a geriatric ward. Most of the delegates had wild staring eyes, the women with rouge daubed randomly all over their faces. Many looked uncertain about quite where - or who - they were. But the Lib Dems' conference in Bournemouth this year could have been mistaken for a geography students' field trip. </p> <p>The youthful faces crowding the terrace of the Highcliff hotel were unlined and wholesome, even blushed with pimples. But the impression this should have made of a party with a promising future was spoilt by the striking absence of a generation for any of them to aspire to. The classic bearded sixtysomething Liberals were there in modest numbers. But the generation in between that actually runs things was almost entirely missing - as if Lib Dems are uniquely vulnerable to a fatal mid-life disease. Which, in a way, they are.</p> <p>If you want to see what politics without any relationship to power looks like, there it was in Bournemouth. \"This is the friendliest conference by far,\" a youthful delegate beamed, and he wasn't wrong. All the unpleasant elements - secret plots, security checkpoints, media scrums, strutting - had been excised, but along with them any governing sense of jeopardy. I didn't even see a single policeman. \"We're like a family,\" someone said, and they certainly seemed immune to status anxiety. Everyone was apparently welcome to everything; at night there were no hot tickets to exclusive parties behind velvet ropes, and it was all very convivial. But it didn't feel like an event that had the slightest bearing on anything.</p> <p>As the global banking system began collapsing, a fringe meeting in a Georgian hotel suite was debating the esoteric distinction between social and liberal democracy. Across the entire fringe, incorrigible optimism bloomed, for at meeting after meeting all the talk was of overtaking Labour to become the chief challenger to the Tories. \"We-e ha-ave,\" a prospective parliamentary candidate warbled breathlessly, so young it wasn't clear if it was nerves or his voice breaking, \"a once-in-a-century opportunity to sideline one of the major parties!\"</p> <p>But the last time I spent much time around Lib Dems, at a byelection four years ago, they were also talking about a historic breakthrough - only then it was to overtake the Tories as challengers to Labour. I ran into the press officer from that campaign in one of the hotel lobbies. How could he still believe in power at the end of the rainbow, just over the next hill? \"Well, the Lib Dems have always been the most optimistic party,\" he said cheerfully. \"When I joined 20 years ago we were polling 6%, with 20 MPs. Now we've got 63 MPs and 18%. That's progress! There's a real sense now that Lib Dems can really get elected. I mean, there's a guy here who was deputy first minister of Scotland. There are Lib Dems who have been in government, and they're alive!\"</p> <p>Nothing seemed to bother them, not even a session with a man from Populus. \"When it comes down to it,\" he told a fringe meeting bluntly, \"two thirds of voters say it doesn't matter what the Lib Dems offer on policy, because they'll always only ever be a protest vote.\" Do your polls ever ask them if they'd vote for us if they thought we could win, someone asked. Er, yes, said the man from Populus. \"But your problem is, lots say they only vote for you because they know you can't.\" Everybody just chuckled.</p> <p>By day two, the trains back to London were filling up with journalists. No one felt like watching a friendly game of bowls, when there might be live naked cage fighting coming up next week.</p> <h2>Labour, Sept 20-24</h2> <p>At first I read the slightly eerie atmosphere in Manchester as suspense. Then it dawned on me that it wasn't that at all. It just felt spooky because there weren't enough people there. There were no queues, and the exhibition stands outside the hall that used to be a corporate forest had thinned to a public sector copse. Delegates too young to remember John Smith, or old enough to remember Hugh Gaitskell, were very thin on the ground. Almost everyone looked like a thirty- to fortysomething professional. </p> <p>When Tony and Cherie Blair emerged from the Radisson for his final leader's speech two years ago, the short walk had the drama of a scene from Reservoir Dogs on a catwalk. Labour party conference used to be the political equivalent of Morton's restaurant on Oscar night. You didn't even need to recognise the ministers by face; you could spot them from the flurry of entourage and cameras. </p> <p>The first sign this year that something strange had happened came when Alistair Darling crossed the concourse and climbed the steps without turning a single head. In the middle of a global economic crisis, the chancellor of the exchequer was attracting less attention than a blonde woman wandering about in a T-shirt that said Never Kissed A Tory. Senior ministers kept strolling by, alone or with just a solitary aide, drawing scarcely a glance, let alone a stampede. </p> <p>David Miliband was the only one swishing up and down, a middle-distance celebrity smile soldered to his face and a semi-circle of photographers stumbling backwards before him. But even that didn't last past his speech. When heads did turn, it was in the direction of men no longer in government: John Prescott, Charles Clarke, Peter Mandelson. But then - hold on - who was that over there? Suddenly, an excited, star-struck swarm burst on to the concourse, jostling as arms scrambled to hoist mobile phones overhead. Everyone craned their necks to see who could be at the centre of the scrum. Not an ex-party leader, or even an ex-minister, but an ex-civil servant - Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>\"It's pretty desperate, isn't it?\" an MP muttered gloomily. \"When the star of the show's a bloody former spin doctor.\" </p> <p>If there was a star of the fringe, it was Compass. The fresh energy and even excitement of the left-leaning group's meetings managed to revive many spirits - but for MPs facing losing their seats, the gloom couldn't lift. </p> <p>Another backbencher's constituency was only just down the road, but he had almost not bothered coming this year. \"I can't stand it,\" he shrugged. \"I can't see the point. People keep saying Brown's got to make himself more likable to voters. But frankly he could start by making himself more likable to his own MPs.\"</p> <p>Most did like his speech. Some were even tearful. As Brown and his wife toured the media parties in overheated suites later that night, a few delegates sprang forward to shake the leader's hand. But as the retinue passed by, the expression on most faces was chillingly blank. They simply stood and stared, distantly curious, like strangers watching a funeral cortege pass by.</p> <p>An anarchic, last days of Rome madness had set in, the hotel bars sodden with hard drinking long into the night. Strangely, no one ever seemed to get drunk - just heavier and darker and more desperate. Reporters huddled in toxic corners with cabinet members, trading the latest names to be called cunts by No10. \"What about me? What did they say about me?\" ashen ministers would gulp, and the paranoia was unnervingly contagious. If ministers weren't frightened of each other, they were frightened of looking like conspirators. When Miliband and James Purnell crossed paths outside the Radisson, an anxious aide murmured that they could be caught on camera together, and discreetly ushered the pair apart. </p> <p>At the New Statesman's final-night party in the gothic majesty of Manchester town hall, a left-leaning businessman tried to rationalise the breakdown as a cycle of abuse. \"I don't think they used to be like this,\" he reflected. \"But when the public start to hate them, they start to hate each other. It's hard to be in government, you know, and it's hard to make a difference. If you intimidate each other you feel as if you're being powerful. It just,\" he finished sadly, \"makes them feel powerful, when they've stopped being able to exercise real power.\" </p> <p>More than a cycle of abuse, it felt like the end of an era. What had begun back in 1994 was turning full circle, the ugly 3am briefing of Ruth Kelly's resignation in the Midland bar a last ghost of the old Red Lion days of Charlie Whelan. But the self-belief - or Faustian pact - that had once sustained the project had broken down into self-loathing. Forged by spin doctors, the party was still in love with Campbell, even as it dissolved into mutinous rage, spitting at the thugggery of his unlovely successor, \"that fucking Damian McBride\". </p> <h2>Conservatives, Sept 28-Oct 1</h2> <p>Fifteen years after the last Tory prime minister was raging at his cabinet \"bastards\", the two parties' parallel circles were almost complete. There were moments in Birmingham, in fact, when the symmetry seemed closer to the narrative of a novel than real life. \"I'm at the Tories,\" a startled reporter texted me before I arrived. \"There are THOUSANDS of them\" - and that was an understatement. In a vast conference centre, guarded by that latterday signifier of import, Group 4, there was scarcely room to move.</p> <p>From the angular, peachy-skinned young bankers and frosted trophy wives to the impeccably groomed elderly couples, the overwhelming first impression was of money. It felt a bit like being back in an 80s wine bar. \"Jeremy! Meet Christina!\" But the freak show of the past decade had been replaced by delegates who, individually at least, would not have been completely out of place at Labour's conference. It was only en masse that they looked identifiably Tory - largely, interestingly, because of the women. Some of the younger men did appear to have emerged from the womb wearing pin stripe, but it was the high heels, fur trim, pearls and pencil skirts that defined the conference aesthetic: Square Mile meets city lawyer, with only the faintest hint of hunt ball. Just two years ago, the elderly country contingent had still been conspicuous, dressed as if for market day, but now you had to look very hard for tweed. Although upper-middle-class, the party suddenly looked urban.</p> <p>The makeover was nothing compared with the new discipline, though, or seriousness of purpose. Lunchtime fringe meetings were packed out, with questions from the floor that were even actual questions, not the traditional rambles beginning \"Would you agree that . . .?\" Some in the finance sessions were so specific and sharply detailed, it bordered on Money Box Live. Whether by accident or design, the party had chosen a venue with only one small hotel bar, so there was nowhere for members to drink and plot even if they had wanted to. Everyone kept moving, eyes fixed firmly on the prize. </p> <p>If they thought it was in the bag, though, they weren't saying so. I asked everyone I spoke to if they thought they were going to win the next election, and not one broke the embargo on triumphalism. \"Ye- ,\" one woman did begin - then checked herself. \"Well, I hope so.\" Some were so tense with self-censorship, they wouldn't talk to the Guardian at all.</p> <p>There was still no hiding where their hearts lay. Two years ago, no matter how many times George Osborne repeated his mantra of \"sharing the proceeds of growth\", he couldn't soothe his party's impatience for tax cuts. Little had changed. Across the fringe, the demands kept coming: What about a flat-rate tax? Corporation tax is crippling small businesses! Why don't we copy Ireland? The discrepancy between the preoccupations of the leadership - \"Our biggest idea is social reform,\" insisted Oliver Letwin - and the rank and file's thirst for market forces was stark. When I asked delegates if they personally knew anyone suffering the sort of social disadvantage David Cameron talks so much about, they stared back at me blankly. </p> <p>\"You're not allowed to speak against the drug addicts on council estates now, are you?\" whispered a middle-aged delegate from Southend. \"It's become censored, hasn't it?\" She giggled naughtily. \"I don't know about a race relations board - you need a board to safeguard white working taxpayers, if you ask me.\" Wasn't she happy with the direction of the party under Cameron? \"Oh yes! Good heavens, yes.\"</p> <p>If anything, Labour's rank and file are more ideologically in tune with their leadership now than most Tories are with theirs. But like old Labour in the 90s, they are being brought to heel by the irresistible promise of power. There isn't the same cultural gap; the Tory frontbench is even richer and whiter than its rightwing followers. But there was a lot of distinctly Blairish goading of old hardliners by shadow ministers, with Michael Gove mocking Simon Heffer's insistence on cutting public spending as though it were as preposterous as renationalising the railways.</p> <p>And so just as in New Labour's early days, observers spent the week trying to work out whether or not the leadership meant what it was saying. I met a former No10 adviser emerging from a session with Letwin. \"Well,\" he said, looking confused, \"that was the most enjoyable hour I've ever spent at a Tory party conference. He was very thoughtful - very impressive.\" </p> <p>How would he feel if the Tories became the next government? There was a long, anguished sigh. \"When I think about it, I get a very strange feeling in my stomach. In a way, you sort of hope they mean what they're saying, because that would make it less destructive. But then you look around you, and you think ... you just think, they can't mean it, can they? Can they?\"</p> <p>Actually, probably not, judging by Cameron's closing speech - a surprisingly retro traditional Tory crowd pleaser, which began by praising the armed forces, the family and even, bizarrely, \"the union\", before romping through one tabloid b\u00eate noir after another - 'elf and safety, bad manners, sloppy spelling. If members had worried that they might be pushed even further out of their comfort zone by Cameron, they went home yesterday reassured. </p> <p>By then it was no longer even clear that it will matter what he really means. The same panic on the markets that was bringing down banks was being played out within both parties, where dramatic shifts in confidence looked in danger of becoming self-fulfilling. \"Being pessimistic,\" joked the shadow minister Paul Goodman, \"is a sackable offence in the Conservative party now.\" If voters do behave like stockbrokers, and the strength of the parties' policies matters less than their mood, then the Tories may be home and dry. </p> <p>Perhaps the more important unanswered question than whether they mean it is whether they are up to it. With a well-disposed press, and a Labour party busy eating itself, they are almost entirely untested. A local councillor, and member for more than 60 years, put it cautiously but anxiously. \"The only thing I'd be concerned about is there's this shadow cabinet, and half of them I've never heard of. I really don't know in my heart that they've got the right guys. If we win, it's going to be very uphill. And I'm just not sure . . . well, I'm just not sure about these chaps.\"</p> <p>In this sense, the political landscape is completely different from 1997. The most powerful lasting impression of conference season was the almost total absence of political giants. At the Lib Dems I had assumed this was just down to the party's insignificance, and at Labour to having been in power for so long that a generation had matured without the freedom of opposition in which to grow. But on stage in Birmingham yesterday, applauding Cameron's speech, where were the formidable faces? Even after 18 years out of power, the last government in waiting had boasted an embarrassment of big beasts: John Prescott, Clare Short, Jack Straw. Most voters would struggle to even name, let alone recognise, the cabinet they say they plan on voting for.</p> <p>Political life today is said to be all about personality and performance, yet it's hard to think of a time when it attracted fewer big personalities or performers. \"It's just,\" a veteran political editor lamented, \"so unbelievably grey, isn't it? Bloody hell, it's grey.\" </p> <p>Tony Benn liked to sit on his canvas folding chair in front of the Quakers' meeting house outside the conference zone in Manchester, eating sandwiches and smoking his pipe. A steady stream of passers-by would stop to pay their respects. A woman confessed she hadn't been on the Stop the War march this year, and started to cry. \"Don't give up!\" he told her gently. \"It's a struggle, but never give up.\" A man approached him hand in hand with two small children. \"I just wanted,\" he explained, \"my children to have met you.\" </p> <p>Giants always look big when you're young, and smaller as you grow older. But if you really wanted to change the world, I'm not sure you would have been at any of the conferences this month.</p> <p>\"It's very odd,\" Benn reflected. \"The TV news comes on, and they interview bankers as if they were politicians. And then the politicians come on afterwards, and they get interviewed as if they were pundits\"</p>",
  "<p>The cover of Nitin Sawhney's new album, London Undersound, shows a man emerging ghost-like from what looks like an underground tunnel. This is Antony Gormley's interpretation of the record's strongest track, Days of Fire, a first-hand account by the singer Natty of witnessing the July 2005 bombings in London. He was a few metres away from the number 30 bus when it exploded in Tavistock Square; a few weeks later, he was on the same tube train as Jean Charles de Menezes when he was shot dead by police. </p> <p>Get Sawhney on this subject and he grows angry, the words flowing thick and fast. London has been his adopted home since he dropped out of a law course at Liverpool University. The album is about the capital, he says, \"and what I feel about London, in the wake of 7/7. It's been a strange rollercoaster since 9/11, in terms of the atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Seeing the erosion of civil liberties, cameras on every street corner, and what we're willing to accept. Jean Charles de Menezes - a public execution, which no one was held accountable for.\" </p> <p>This anger comes through in London Undersound, Sawhney's eighth album in a career that has taken him from 2000's Mercury Music prize-nominated Beyond Skin to scores for more than 40 films and video games, as well as collaborations with Gormley and the choreographer Akram Khan (2005's Zero Degrees); and the theatre company Complicite (A Disappearing Number). There's a dub-flavoured track about feeling afraid to travel alone on the tube late at night; a powerful song asserting that \"we're in this together\" - recorded, Sawhney explains, according to \"a ritual\" that took him and the singer Imogen Heap to each of the four corners of the city, from east London's Billingsgate fish market to the western suburb of Southall. Sawhney says he feels frustrated when he hears people say that music and politics should never mix: \"The bands I admired when I was growing up ... challenged authority, whether it was Public Enemy, NWA, the South African jazz scene, and John Lennon. Music shouldn't be afraid.\" </p> <p>One of the people Sawhney approached as a potential collaborator on the album was Paul McCartney; the result is the saccharine ballad My Soul, the lyrics to which - \"I long to know all your secrets/ I want to walk through your fire\" - eulogise, some newspapers have suggested, McCartney's relationship with Heather Mills. Sawhney stops short of confirming this. \"Every day I was reading about Paul and the paparazzi,\" he says. \"So I thought, 'Why don't I just phone him up and say, do you want to write about how you feel about what's going on?' And he just said, 'Yeah, that would be wicked.' So he came over and just hung out at the house.\" Sawhney laughs, as if unable to believe his luck. </p> <p>Sawhney's last two albums, 2005's Philtre and 2003's Human, felt more personal than political, reflecting on his own family and upbringing. He was born in Rochester, Kent, in 1964; his father, a biochemist, and his mother, an Indian classical dancer, had come to England from the Punjab the year before, and Sawhney grew up one of three brothers, the only Asian boys in their comprehensive school. The themes of identity and immigration, war and peace, are rarely far from his music's heart. Beyond Skin opens with the Indian prime minister talking about nuclear tests in 1998, and ends with Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the nuclear bomb, quoting from the sacred Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita: \"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\"</p> <p>It's Sawhney's interest in what makes us human that makes him nervous around the labels \"fusion\" and \"world music\", both of which he thinks frustrate rather than promote understanding. \"Everything that we are, that we think, that we feel - comes from one,\" he says. \"So 'fusion' for me is a problem. It's the idea that we are all separate, and I have always thought of looking for commonality. That's what I get a kick out of.\" </p> <p>The next few months remain busy for Sawhney. He's working on scores for four films - among them a Portuguese-language film about de Menezes; and One Day On Earth, a documentary about climate change. There's a mooted collaboration with the London Symphony Orchestra; three hours of orchestration for another video game (Sawhney's last, Heavenly Sword for Sony PlayStation 3, proved a hit); a DJing session for the Singapore Grand Prix; and, last but not least, a European concert tour. No wonder that Sawhney's work ethic has seen him described in his website biography as a \"latter-day Renaissance man\". Is this how he sees himself?</p> <p>Sawhney is uncharacteristically lost for words. \"Erm ... I just see myself as trying to make music. I like working with lots of different art forms, as well as other musicians. But you know the Renaissance focused on humanism, and actually came from diversity, because of what happened in Florence, with the influx of people with new ideas. It was a re-awakening. So if somebody thinks I'm part of that way of thinking, that's a good thing\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>London Undersound</strong> is released on October 13 on Positiv-Id. Sawhney plays the Roundhouse, London (0844 482 8008), on October 24. Then touring.</p>",

  "<p>Dismal manufacturing activity, soaring job losses and a record slump in car sales added to pressure on Congress yesterday to reach a deal on the Bush administration's contentious $700bn emergency economic bail-out package.</p> <p>Gloomy economic news sent the Dow Jones industrial average down by more than 200 points at one stage during another volatile day on Wall Street, although the blue-chip index later recovered to close down 19 at 10,831.</p> <p>A key measure of US manufacturing output showed that activity has shrunk to its lowest level for seven years as orders dry up.

Carmakers are close behind with 94,918 redundancies according to employment consultants Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. The combination of erosion in both employment and manufacturing activity alarmed analysts. On the credit markets, a surge this week in the Libor rate at which banks borrow money from each other is causing particular concern, indicating that the flow of cash is freezing up. \"For the first time it's really starting to look like a recession,\" said Marc Pado, chief US market strategist at broker Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco.</p> <p>The price of oil dipped below $100 per barrel in New York to close at $98.53, a fall of $2.11, on evidence that Americans are driving less.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338188216\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1830712389_NewMexico-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Barack Obama's appeal was unusually direct. \"I want you to start voting your numbers,\" the Democratic presidential candidate urged the crowd of 10,000 gathered in the New Mexican town of Espa\u00f1ola. \"Start flexing your muscles.\"</p> <p>Obama's entreaties reflect a cause for optimism and concern in the Democratic camp in New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. All are targets for Obama, and all are states in which a large Hispanic population could make the difference. But turnout is the key. If the Democrats in New Mexico fail to get people out to vote, the party could see a repetition of recent history.</p> <p>In 2000 New Mexico voted for Al Gore by the tightest of margins: 366 votes. In 2004, George Bush and Karl Rove engineered a 6,000-vote Republican win. This time, polls show Obama with an 8-point lead over his Republican rival.</p> <p>Sitting in the Spic &amp; Span Bakery, a breakfast institution in the northern New Mexican Democratic stronghold of Las Vegas, local party chairman Martin Suazo has a theory. \"The reason we lost New Mexico in 2004 is because the Republicans had a better strategy,\" he says. \"They ignored strong Democratic counties. While we were getting 63% turnout among registered Democrats, they were in the 70s. We spent a lot of time trying to win over voters we didn't have. We ended up not motivating our voters. They outworked us.\"</p> <p>The lessons have been learned. The Obama campaign has spent $20m (\u00a310m) reaching out to Hispanic voters nationally, and has flooded states such as New Mexico with Spanish-language TV and radio ads. This time, as Obama let his crowd know, the stress is on getting the Democrats to the polls.</p> <p>At the Obama campaign office in the picturesque town plaza in Las Vegas, volunteers drift in and out, while voters call in to collect yard signs.</p> <p>\"Our goal is to knock on 2,000 doors,\" urges a sign. On one wall there is a list of 40 canvassers signed up for knocking on doors. \"Typically if this state swings towards a Republican state, it's because we didn't get out our vote,\" says estate agent and volunteer Yvette Arellanes.</p> <p>But there are problems for the youthful Team Obama, installed in the town since the summer. The town of 14,000 and the surrounding San Miguel county voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in the Democratic caucus. \"There were a lot of hurt feelings,\" says Suazo.</p> <p>Those feelings were not helped by the tactics of Team Obama, a clash of cultures that Suazo characterises as traditionalists versus progressives. The traditionalists would hold barbeques, hand out stickers and rely on speeches, the progressives prefer text messages, emails and debate watch parties.</p> <p>The new approach has alienated many older, more traditional Hispanic Democrats, the ones who can normally be relied on to vote. \"You've got families in the north who have been here since before this was a state,\" says Gabriel Sanchez, of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \"There is a patron-type system there, with a handful of old-style political families wielding power. Hispanics have had a lot of political representation. It's not a question of getting a place at the table. They've had that.\"</p> <p>During the primary campaign, as Hispanics overwhelmingly voted for Clinton, many questioned whether they would be ready to elect an African-American president. The question still holds. A local Republican chairman in northern New Mexico was forced to resign last month after telling a reporter from the BBC that: \"Hispanics came here as conquerors. African-Americans came here as slaves. Hispanics consider themselves above blacks. They won't vote for a black president.\"</p> <p>The remarks caused a storm, with Hispanic leaders rushing to deny the charge. \"The $1m question is whether it is race or the economy that is motivating Democratic Hispanics,\" says Sanchez. \"I would be shocked if race was the deciding factor, but you never know.\"</p> <p>Immigration is not a live issue for Hispanic voters in northern New Mexico. Ask them about immigration and they invariably pause before noting that they didn't migrate anywhere: the US border migrated south.</p> <p>Polling shows Hispanic voters across the nation preoccupied with the same list of priorities as white voters: the economy, healthcare, education. Immigration tends to rank around seventh place. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Republican party's disastrous handling of immigration reform may have served to alienate many voters, who considered that they were being criminalised for being Hispanic. </p> <p>And the perceived abandonment by John McCain of the moderate immigration reform he had sponsored as he sought his party's nomination has rankled with many Hispanics voters.</p> <p>\"There's been a real rebellion against the Republican party [on the issue],\" says Simon Rosenberg, director of NDN, a liberal thinktank that focuses on Latino issues. \"They've been vilified in the media for three years and they don't like it. McCain abdicated his position so instead of being seen as a champion he's a betrayer. It's been a sea change.\"</p> <p>But Hispanic Republicans do exist in Las Vegas. In the Hillcrest restaurant, Carlos Lovato stands out in the all-male clientele with his \"Dads for McCain\" cap. \"The Hispanic people are conservative,\" he says. \"John McCain's a solid guy. It's better to have your neighbour\" - McCain represents neighbouring Arizona - \"your friend, as the president.\"</p> <p>Obama has the state's governor, Bill Richardson, the only Hispanic governor in the nation, forcefully backing him.</p> <p>But something more is needed, says Suazo. \"The best way to get to the Hispanic Democratic voter is for them to be able to feel, hear, touch and see Obama,\" says Suazo. \"The Hispanic voter is a very emotional voter.\"</p>",

  "<p>The financial crisis may be dominating the US presidential campaign, but the season's most intriguing political battle is shaping up as a straightforward fight for survival between two old foes: Sarah Palin and the polar bear. When the US government decided to classify Ursus maritimus as an endangered species earlier in the year, Palin sued in attempt to overturn the ruling, fearing the label would deter oil and gas exploration in Alaska. The case of Palin v Polar bear will be heard in January. Here's how the contenders size up: <br><strong><br>Range</strong><br>Polar bear: Found across the Arctic regions of five countries; the US, Canada, Russia, Norway and Greenland. <br>Sarah Palin: Not quite as well travelled. Lives within sight of Russia, but has never ventured there, possibly because of diminishing sea ice. </p> <p><strong>Conservation status</strong><br>Polar bear: Vulnerable, largely due to climatic change and the resulting habitat loss. <br>Palin: Also vulnerable, because of a lack of experience and controversial stances on abortion, creationism, global warming, same-sex marriage and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Predatory armoury</strong><br>Polar bear: Possesses razor-sharp teeth, a powerful build and a sense of smell that can detect a seal a mile away under three feet of snow. Still unlikely to triumph in a direct confrontation with Palin however, unless the Alaska legislature suddenly decides to uphold the right to arm bears. <br>Palin: Licensed gun-owner, avid hunter and crack shot. Palin also supports a policy of shooting wolves from helicopters in order to increase the Alaskan moose population so that Alaskans can shoot more moose. Deadly. </p> <p><strong>Impact of climate change</strong><br>Polar bear: Length of hunting season has diminished, birth rates have fallen and it now has insufficient fat reserves. <br>Palin: None observed.</p> <p><strong>Biggest supporters</strong><br>Polar bear: Greenpeace, the US department of the interior, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey.<br>Palin: Hockey moms, the National Rifle Association, rightwing fundamentalist Christians, climate change deniers, the oil industry, God (endorsement unconfirmed). </p> <p><strong>Biggest threat to survival </strong><br>Polar bear: Sarah Palin. <br>Palin: Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, feminism, belated national reality check brought on by global economic crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Snow, who has died aged 81, had occupied a unique position in the cultural life of Britain since the second world war, as a painter, theatre designer, teacher and interventionist. He was also a larger-than-life character, flamboyantly bohemian, a keen biker, a lover of \"happenings\" - already by the 50s a true child of the 60s - and a much loved and influential head of theatre design at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1967 and 1992.</p> <p>He designed the British premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, directed by Peter Hall at the Arts Theatre in 1955. The blasted tree demanded by Beckett stood upstage, behind a grim scrim which parted to reveal the tramps in baggy, pinstriped trousers, battered bowlers and dinner jackets - Snow also designed the costumes - skewered by fate in a bleak terrain of stones, a wooden box and an upturned dustbin. </p> <p>Snow had been working in the theatre since 1951, when he designed Love's Labour's Lost for the Southwark Shakespeare Festival before joining Joan Littlewood, who remained a lifelong friend, at her Theatre Workshop in Stratford East. Two of his most admired designs for Littlewood in 1954 were for the first revival in 300 years of John Marston's The Dutch Courtesan, with Avis Bunnage and George A Cooper, and George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple with Harry H Corbett as the charismatic Dick Dudgeon.</p> <p>Other early theatre work included designs for Lennox Berkeley's one-act opera A Dinner Engagement at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1954, Frederick Ashton's ballet Variations on a Theme by Purcell at the Royal Opera House in 1955, and No\u00ebl Coward's South Sea Bubble, starring Vivien Leigh at the Lyric Theatre in 1956. </p> <p>His first solo show as a painter was at the Prospect Gallery in London in 1951, followed by an important exhibition at the Beaux Arts in 1957, and he would move from the gloomy, so-called \"kitchen sink\" school to a much more eclectic, colourful style over the years, a transition that was completed during a life-changing Churchill fellowship at the end of the 1960s.</p> <p>He stopped first in New York and was astonished by the vigour and excitement of the performance art and avant-garde theatre of that time, before moving on to Mexico to study ancient rituals, masks and the Day of the Dead. Out of this came some of his most vivid painting and two multi-media entertainments, Reflections. The first was held at Oval House in south London in 1971, the second at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1975, which combined elements of tantric sex, motorcycle gear with glam-rock accoutrements and a bevy of naked dancers, doves and magicians.</p> <p>Snow was an open-minded and adventure-seeking maverick who defied his sensible background in Catford, south London, where his father, Frederick, was a civil engineer (later knighted for his work on the Kingsway underpass at the Aldwych, central London, and Heathrow airport). In 1946, he studied briefly at Goldsmiths College and worked as a journalist on the South London Press before national service with the Royal Engineers in the Middle East.</p> <p>He began his association with the Slade with a scholarship there, studying until 1953 and joining the staff in 1957. He was head of theatre design, succeeding Robert Medley, whose key role in the pre-war period was an authenticating factor in Snow's own great success as a teacher. Teaching became his life's work.</p> <p>Students at the Slade included Derek Jarman, Yolanda Sonnabend and Philip Prowse, the last two forming, with Sally Jacobs, a formidable teaching triumvirate, with Prowse as professor. Snow was heartbroken when the theatre design department was discontinued after his retirement. </p> <p>Sonnabend recalled that Snow was both a fantasist and a gentleman, and averred that his paintings, particularly some of the murky, rainy ones that he did of the Kennington area of south London in which he lived, are seriously underrated. He was always witty and delightfully prone, after a drink or two, to say the wrong thing. He began a speech at a dinner to mark the retirement of an otherwise popular Slade director with the remark: \"We all know Bernard's a bit of a shit ...\"</p> <p>Prowse, who went on to be an inspirational director of the Glasgow Citizens Theatre in the 1970s, believed Snow to be much influenced by the Belgian painter James Ensor, a precursor of surrealism. He loved fairgrounds and carnivals, street lights reflected in puddles, all such signs of urban magic. He designed a famous Copp\u00e9lia at a time when the piece was seldom seen, and Prowse recalled with gratitude that he put his name forward for a significant Sleeping Beauty at the Dutch National Ballet. \"He was a very generous man, and he didn't begrudge his students being cleverer than him - which didn't happen very often anyway.\"</p> <p>Snow designed a BBC film about Rex Whistler in 1978 and continued to exhibit regularly at the Beaux Arts and, after it closed down, the Piccadilly and Albemarle galleries. His occasional portraits include studies of Joan Littlewood and Richard Eyre, the film and theatre directors, which hang in the National Portrait Gallery. </p> <p>In 1963 he married Maria Wirth, an Australian colour consultant and interior designer.

  "<p>Jonathan Lichtenstein's play originated at Clwyd Theatr Cymru, travelled to off-Broadway and arrives in Islington. And, even if it traverses familiar ground in its evocation of the horrors of 1930s Germany, it is grippingly directed by Terry Hands.</p> <p>Lichtenstein's point is that the Israelis, of all people, should allow memories of past persecution to influence present actions. Using the format of a play in rehearsal, he counterpoints two stories. He shows us Peter, son of a Kinderstransport refugee, visiting his grandmother, Eva, in Berlin in 1990 to force her to confront her buried memories of life under the Nazis and of the price she paid for survival. Interspersed are scenes from today showing an Israeli conscript confronting an elderly Palestinian whose home is to be bulldozed for the West Bank wall.</p> <p>The contrast between two aspects of Jewish experience is pointed and pungent. Lichtenstein's political argument is vitiated, however, by the fact he pays far more attention to historic Berlin than present-day Bethlehem. Eva's tragic story is compelling, whereas the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more cursorily handled.</p> <p> Even with this imbalance, there is much pleasure to be had from the staging and the acting. Vivien Parry is hugely impressive as Eva, and Oliver Ryan as her grandson and Simon Nehan and Daniel Hawksford as past wooers provide staunch support.</p>",
  "<p>Nervous investors are shunning banks in the current financial crisis, and putting their savings into one of history's most tangible representations of wealth: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/commodities\">gold bars and coins</a>. Demand is so high among the world's wealthy that suppliers are seeing their stocks dramatically depleted.</p> <p>\"It's notable that there has been an increase in interest in gold generally,\" according to Justin Oliver, senior investment manager at Collins Stewart, who advises worried investors about where to put their money. \"Gold is still viewed as a safe haven in times of crisis\".</p> <p>Just last week the US Mint, which has been responsible for ensuring an adequate supply of American coinage since 1792, was forced to halt sales of the \"American Buffalo\" solid 24 carat gold coins because it was running out of supplies. It had already needed to ration supplies of the 22 carat \"American Eagle\" alternative by starting an allocation programme which limits the number that can be sold at any given time.</p> <p>The price of both one ounce coins was also lower than the price of an ounce of gold on the open market at the time, making them incredibly tempting to investors looking to make a quick return. Having broken through the $1,000 (\u00a3562) barrier earlier in the year, the gold price has retreated and is now trading at around $880 an ounce. The 2007 American Eagle one ounce coin, however, was going for at $789.95 while the 2006 Buffalo coin cost $800. The prices of the current - 2008 - editions are $1,119.95 and $1,199.95.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the US Mint said sales of 24 ounce coins are up 34% this year, with 164,000 snapped up already.</p> <p>\"We are now working diligently to build up our inventories and hope to be able to re-sell the coins shortly,\" she added.</p> <p>In London, meanwhile, one of the UK's leading gold bar and coin merchants ATS Bullion has experienced unprecedented demand over the past few days at its shop next door to the Savoy Hotel.</p> <p>\"There has been enormous demand,\" according to managing director Sandra Conway. \"There are very few sellers of physical gold and we have had queues of people today.\"</p> <p>\"We have got gold in stock but there have been some shortages, especially of Krugerrands.\"</p> <p>Named after Paul Kruger, who headed up the Boer resistance to the British in the 19th century, Krugerrands were first minted in South Africa in 1967. Although it was illegal to import them into the UK during the 1970s and 1980s, because of apartheid, they are now one of the most widely circulated gold coins. As such the price of the one ounce coins tends to track the gold price to within a few percentage points, making them a perfect vehicle for investors. </p> <p>The World Gold Council, formed and funded by the world's leading gold mining companies, has seen a clamour for gold from across the world. Some refineries are believed to be having trouble keeping up with demand.</p> <p>\"We are seeing a large amount of buying in the retail sector, in the form of bars and coins,\" said a spokesman. \"But there is also heavy buying in gold-backed securities\".</p> <p>Gold is traded in the form of securities on stock exchanges in Australia, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK and US. Called exchange traded commodities or exchange traded funds (ETFs), they track the gold price almost perfectly and are actually backed with physical gold.</p> <p>They appeal to investors because they do not require the actual storage of gold by the buyer and ETFs are traded in a number of currencies while the gold price is set in dollars which can be an advantage, especially to European investors.</p> <p>The World Gold Council reckons such securities represent about 38% of all the world's investment in gold. There are now 1088 tonnes of gold invested in these markets with strong buying reported over the past few days.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's mission to replace Russian forces inside Georgia began modestly today when the first EU armoured vehicles began patrolling inside the so-called buffer zone next to Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia.</p> <p>After negotiations with Russian troops, two EU vehicles slipped past the Russian checkpoint at the village of Karaleti this morning. They spent an hour and half touring villages occupied by Russian forces before returning to Georgian-controlled territory.</p> <p>This small but symbolic outing by a handful of French military police officers - unarmed but wearing dark blue berets and EU armbands - marked the beginning of the EU's deployment in four regions of Georgia.</p> <p>But it was not clear whether the EU's arrival means Russia will now pull out. Under a revised agreement between France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Russia's president Dmitry Medvedev, Moscow has until October 10 to remove its military from generous buffer zones next to South Ossetia and Akbhazia.</p> <p>Last night Medvedev indicated Russia would leave on time. \"Russian peacekeepers will be withdrawn from Georgia within the agreed dates,\" he said. </p> <p>EU mission head, Hansj\u00f6rg Haber, said: \"The process has begun. We are entering the adjacent areas. This is the beginning of the takeover.\"</p> <p>Today, however, there was no evidence of a Russian withdrawal. Russian \"peacekeepers\" at Karaleti, three miles north of the city of Gori, in central Georgia, stopped and searched Georgian civilian vehicles. The Russian flag flew above a roadside camp, surrounded by razor wire.</p> <p>Residents in the buffer zone - most of whom fled during August's brief war between Russia and Georgia - said that South Ossetian paramilitaries continued to rampage in the area. The militias burned down houses belonging to ethnic Georgians, kidnapped civilians and stole cattle, they said.</p> <p>\"The Russians are not doing anything to stop this. They are just standing around,\" Givi Goligashvili, 68, told the Guardian, riding his donkey-drawn cart to the buffer zone village of Garejvari. He added: \"The Ossetians are taking all the cattle from the villages and making the Georgians leave. The Ossetians are now the rulers here.\" </p> <p>\"If the Europeans and the Georgian police are in position we will go back,\" Giuli Kasradze, 53, from Ergneti, said - showing off photos on her mobile phone of her gutted two-storey home. Kasradze said that Ossetian paramilitaries had burned down her property, returning on Monday and firing at the last 12 houses in the nearby village of Disevi.</p> <p>Aid workers today said the region's refugee problem would be largely solved if the Russians left. Some 12,000 displaced residents who fled the conflict are currently camping out in Gori \u2013 2,200 of them in a well-organised tent city on a central sports field. Another 37,000 are staying in Tbilisi.</p> <p>\"Ninety per cent are from the buffer zone. As soon as the Russians withdraw we expect the vast majority to go back,\" said Stefano Berti, UNHCR's head of field operations in Gori. He added: \"The mere presence of EU monitors helps. It gives the impression that the international community is here.\"</p> <p>The Kremlin has given ambiguous signals about possible restrictions on the movements of the 323-strong EU force, which includes monitors from the UK. On Tuesday Russian officials hinted the EU would not be allowed into the buffer zone. Today Russian soldiers at Karaleti said this was mere western mischief-making.</p> <p>\"As you can see the EU came here no problem,' a Russian officer standing at the Karaleti checkpoint told the Guardian, as French and Polish monitors began an afternoon patrol. \"To suggest otherwise is to make a sensation.\" Asked when he intended to leave Georgia, he said: \"We will do everything in accordance with the agreement.\"</p> <p>Russia has refused to allow the EU beyond the zone and into South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia's other breakaway region. It recognised both as independent in late August and has recently signed agreements allowing it to maintain a permanent military garrison of 7,600 troops. Medvedev earlier agreed to pull his forces back to their pre-conflict positions.</p> <p>British diplomats concede that persuading Russia to withdraw from Georgia's separatist regions is a long-term project. At the same time EU enthusiasm for sanctions against Russia appears to have evaporated, with the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly unlikely to agree on punishing Moscow during a debate on the conflict later tomorrow.<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>It's great to be here in the Symphony Hall. But it's even better to know that in this party, everyone: the Shadow Cabinet, the Members of Parliament, the council leaders and all our candidates and colleagues. Everyone is playing the same tune.</p> <p><strong>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS</strong></p> <p>Today the financial crisis means that all eyes are on the economy and the financial markets and that is absolutely right. As I said yesterday, on this issue, we must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure financial stability. I am pleased that our proposal to increase the protection for depositors to \u00a350,000 has been taken up. I'm pleased that the European regulators are looking at our proposal to bring stability to the banking system. I repeat: we will not allow what happened in America to happen here, we will work with the government in the short term in order to protect our economy. But as I also said yesterday, that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made. It is our political duty and if we had a written constitution I would say constitutional duty to hold the government to account, to explain where they went wrong, and how we would do things differently to rebuild our economy for the long-term.</p> <p>So we must not hold back from being critical of the decisions that over ten years have led us to this point. We need to learn the lessons, and to offer the British people a clear choice. It is our responsibility to make sense of this crisis for them, and to show them the right way out of it. We started to do that in Birmingham this week. We've had a good conference this week, an optimistic conference - but a sober one. We understand the gravity of the situation our country is in. And our response is measured, proportionate and responsible. The test of a political party is whether it can rise to the challenge of what the country requires and what the times demand. I believe we have passed that test this week and I want to thank George Osborne, William Hague, all my team in the Shadow Cabinet and all of you for making this conference a success. The reality of government is that difficulties come not in neat and predictable order, one by one and at regular intervals. Difficulties come at you from all sides, one on top of the other, and you've got to be able to handle them all. So amidst this financial crisis let us not forget that we are also a nation at war.</p> <p><strong>AFGHANISTAN</strong></p> <p>In Afghanistan today, our armed forces are defending our freedom and our way of life as surely and as bravely as any soldiers in our nation's history. Let us be clear about why they are there: if we fail in our mission, the Taliban will come back. And if the Taliban come back, the terrorist training camps come back. That would mean more terrorists, more bombs and more slaughter on our streets. That is why we back our troops' mission in Afghanistan one hundred per cent. I've been to visit them every year since I've been doing this job. Earlier this month, up the Helmand River in Sangin I met a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Ranger Blaine Miller. He'd just turned eighteen years old. He was the youngest soldier there. He's not much more than a boy and he's there in the forty-five degree heat, fighting a ferocious enemy on the other side of the world. I told him that what he was doing was exceptional. He told me he was just doing his job.</p> <p>Every politician says it's the first duty of government is to protect our country, and of course that's right. But today we are not protecting the people, like Blaine, who protect us - and that is wrong. In Afghanistan, the number of our troops has almost doubled but the number of helicopters has hardly increased at all. American soldiers start their rest and recuperation the day they arrive back home, our troops have to count the days they spend getting home. We've got troops' families living in sub-standard homes; we've got soldiers going into harm's way without the equipment they need we've got businesses in our country that instead of welcoming people in military uniform and honouring their service choose to turn them away and refuse them service. That is all wrong and we are going to put it right. We are going to stop sending young men to war without the equipment they need, we're going to stop treating our soldiers like second class citizens we will do all it takes to keep our country safe and we will do all it takes to protect the heroes who risk everything for us.</p> <p><strong>GURKHAS</strong></p> <p>And today there are a particular group of heroes that I have in mind. They fought for us in the slit trenches of Burma the jungles of Malaya and the freezing cold of the Falklands. Yesterday the courts ruled that Gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to. They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them. I say to the government: I know there are difficult questions about pensions and housing but let's find a way to make it work. Do not appeal this ruling.<br>Let's give those brave Gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country.</p> <p><strong>VALUES AND CHARACTER</strong></p> <p>These are times of great anxiety. The financial crisis. The economic downturn. The cost of living. Big social problems. I know how worried people are. They want to know whether our politics, and let's be frank, whether our politicians - are up to it. In the end, that's not really about your policies and your plans. Of course your plans are important but it's the unexpected and unpredicted events that can dominate a government. So people want to know what values you bring to big situations and big decisions that can crop up on your watch. And people want to know about your character: the way you make decisions; the way that you operate.</p> <p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p> <p>My values are Conservative values. Many people wrongly believe that the Conservative Party is all about freedom. Of course we care passionately about freedom from oppression and state control. That's why we stood up for Georgia and wasn't it great to have the Georgian Prime Minister with us here, speaking today? But freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want, regardless of the effect on others. That is libertarian, not Conservative - and it is certainly not me.</p> <p>For me, the most important word is responsibility. Personal responsibility. Professional responsibility. Civic responsibility. Corporate responsibility. Our responsibility to our family, to our neighbourhood, our country. Our responsibility to behave in a decent and civilised way. To help others. That is what this Party is all about. Every big decision; every big judgment I make: I ask myself some simple questions. Does this encourage responsibility and discourage irresponsibility? Does this make us a more or less responsible society? Social responsibility, not state control. Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.</p> <p><strong>CHARACTER</strong></p> <p>But when it comes to handling a crisis when it comes to really making a difference on the big issues it's not just about your values. There's something else people want to know. When people ask: \"will you make a difference?\" they're often asking will you \u2013 i.e. me \u2013 will you make a difference? You can't prove you're ready to be Prime Minister \u2013 and it would be arrogant to pretend you can. The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work; how you make decisions and then live with them.</p> <p>I'm a forty-one year old father of three who thinks that family is the most important thing there is. For me. For my country. I am deeply patriotic about this country and believe we have both a remarkable history and an incredible future. I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk. I have a simple view that public service is a good way to channel your energy and try to make a difference. I am not an ideologue. I know that my party can get things wrong, and that other parties sometimes get things right. I hold to some simple principles. That strong defence, the rule of law and sound money are the foundations of good government</p> <p>But I am also a child of my time. I want a clean environment as well as a safe one. I believe that quality of life matters as much as quantity of money. I recognise that we'll never be truly rich while so much of the world is so poor. I believe in building a strong team \u2013 and really trusting them. Their success is to be celebrated \u2013 not seen as some kind of threat. Thinking before deciding is good. Not deciding because you don't like the consequences of a decision is bad. Trust your principles, your judgment and your colleagues. Go with your conviction, not calculation. The popular thing may look good for a while. The right thing will be right all the time. Tony Blair used to justify endless short-term initiatives by saying \"we live in a 24 hour media world.\"</p> <p>But this is a country not a television station. A good government thinks for the long term. If we win we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess. We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term good of the country. I know that. I'm ready for that.</p> <p><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></p> <p>And there is a big argument I want to make \u2013 about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, yes but about the other issues facing the country too. It's an argument about experience. To do difficult things for the long-term or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term what matters more than experience is character and judgment, and what you really believe needs to happen to make things right. I believe that to rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change. To repair our broken society, it's not more of the same we need, but change.</p> <p>Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages. Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change. In 1979, James Callaghan had been Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor before he became Prime Minister. He had plenty of experience. But thank God we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Just think about it: if we listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government, ever. We'd have Gordon Brown as Prime Minister \u2013 for ever.</p> <p>Gordon Brown talks about his economic experience. The problem is, we have actually experienced his experience. We've experienced the massive increase in debt. We have experienced the huge rise in taxes. We experienced the folly of pretending that boom and bust could be ended. This is the argument we will make when the election comes. The risk is not in making a change. The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result. There is a simple truth for times like this. When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going. You change direction \u2013 and that is what we need to do. So let's look at how we got here \u2013 and how we're going to get out.</p> <p><strong>HOW WE GOT HERE</strong></p> <p>At the heart of the financial crisis is a simple fact. The tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long. The debts we built up were too high. Far too high. The authorities \u2013 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 thought it could go on for ever.</p> <p>They thought the days of low inflation and low interest rates could go on for ever. They thought the asset price bubble didn't matter. But it's not just the authorities who were at fault. Many bankers in the City were quite simply irresponsible. They paid themselves vast rewards when it was all going well and the minute it went wrong, they came running to us to bail them out. There will be a day of reckoning but today is not that day. Today we have to understand the long-term policy mistakes that were made.</p> <p>In this country, Gordon Brown made two big mistakes. His first big mistake \u2013 and his worst decision, sowing the seeds of the present financial crisis was actually contained within his best decision: to make the Bank of England independent.</p> <p>Let me explain. At the same time as giving the Bank of England the power to set interest rates he took away the Bank of England's power to regulate financial markets. And he took away the Bank of England's power to blow the whistle on the total amount of debt in the economy. He changed the rules of the game, but he took the referee off the pitch. Eddie George, who was the Bank of England Governor at the time, was only given a few hours notice of this massive decision. He feared it would end in tears \u2013 and it has.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's second big mistake was on government borrowing. After a prudent start, when he stuck for two years to Conservative spending totals, he turned into a spendaholic. His spending splurge left the government borrowing money in the good times when it should have been saving money. So now that the bad times have hit, there's no money to help. The cupboard is bare.</p> <p><strong>HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT</strong></p> <p>So the question is, how are we going to get through this crisis? How are we going to rebuild our economy for the long term? Now I've studied economics at a great university. I've worked in business alongside great entrepreneurs. And as Gordon Brown never stops reminding people, I've been inside the Treasury during a crisis. But when it comes to handling the situation we're in, none of that matters as much as some simple things I believe to be true.</p> <p><strong>SOUND MONEY</strong></p> <p>First of all, I believe that government's main economic duty is to ensure sound money and low taxes. Sound money means controlling inflation, keeping spending under control and getting debt down. So we will rein in private borrowing by correcting that big mistake made by Gordon Brown, and restoring the Bank of England's power to limit debt in the economy. That will help give our economy the financial responsibility it needs. But we need fiscal responsibility too.</p> <p>So we will rein in government borrowing. You know what that means. The country needs to know what that means. And it has a lot clearer idea now, thanks to that fantastic speech by George Osborne on Monday, one of the finest speeches made by any Shadow Chancellor. Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad. It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture it means clamping down on government waste and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.</p> <p>So I will be asking all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary, really justifiable in these new economic circumstances. But even that will not be enough.</p> <p>The really big savings will come from reforming inefficient public services, and dealing with the long-term social problems that cause government spending to rise. To help us stick to the right course, we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility. There will be no hiding place, no fiddling the figures \u2013 for all governments, forever. It's not experience that will bring about these long-term changes. Experience means you're implicated in the old system that's failed. You can't admit that change is needed, because that would mean admitting you'd got it wrong. We propose a major shake-up in the way the public finances are run and we have the character and the judgment to scrap the discredited fiscal rules and make this vital long-term change.</p> <p><strong>LOW TAXES</strong></p> <p>It's a change that will help us get taxes down. I believe in low taxes \u2013 and today, working people are crying out for relief. Like the young couple I met in York three weeks ago, who both work seven days a week and still struggle to make enough to pay the mortgage.</p> <p>But I am a fiscal conservative. So is George Osborne. We do not believe in tax cuts paid for by reckless borrowing. So let me say this to the call centre worker whose mortgage has gone up by four hundred quid a month but his salary's gone down. To the hairdresser who's a single mum doing another job on the side to try and make ends meet and pay for childcare. To the electrician whose fuel bill, rent bill and food bill have all gone up and he's trying to work out which one to pay when the tax bill's gone up too.</p> <p>I know it's your money. I know you want some of it back. And I want to give it to you. It's one of the reasons I'm doing this job. But we will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so once we've made government live within its means. The test of whether we're ready for government is not whether we can come up with exciting shadow budgets. It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve and say \"no\" - even in the teeth of hostility and protest. That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead.</p> <p><strong>ENTERPRISE</strong></p> <p>Sound money; low taxes. Simple beliefs with profound implications. And here's something else I believe about the economy. I believe that people create jobs, not governments. I understand enterprise. I admire entrepreneurs. I should do \u2013 I go to bed with one every night. And today, Labour's taxes and regulations are making life impossible for our entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Just this week, the exodus of business from Labour's Britain continued as WPP announced it was moving to Ireland. A man called Steven Ellis Cooper emailed me at the end of last month. You know him, this conference heard his story on Sunday. He's from Worcestershire \u2013 and with his wife and two daughters he's been running his business for nearly twenty years. He saw it grow into something he described as \"magical\", employing five people and contributing to the economy. And then along came Labour . Now he's down to his last employee and he says \"I am sat at my desk now in tears as I'm so sad that what I have spent such a long time trying to build up is being so systematically smashed into the floor and the Labour Government are to blame.\" What an outrageous way for a government to treat someone who's trying to do their best, trying to make a living for their family, trying to create opportunity for others. So here's what we're going to do. We'll start by dealing with the nightmare complexity of our business taxes. We'll get rid of those complex reliefs and allowances and use the savings to cut corporation tax by three pence.</p> <p><strong>BEYOND FINANCE</strong></p> <p>But I don't believe that the government's role in the economy is just about tax and spend and sound money and finance. I have never believed in just laissez-faire. I believe the government should play an active part in helping business and industry. So when our economy is overheating in the south east but still needs more investment in the north the right thing to do is not go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow but instead build a new high speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester, London, Leeds let's help rebalance Britain's economy.</p> <p>But the problems this country faces go far beyond financial crisis and economic downturn. In the end I want to be judged not just on how well we handle crises, but on two things how we improve the public institution in this country I care about most, the NHS and how we fulfil what will be the long-term mission of the next Conservative government: to repair our broken society.</p> <p><strong>NO TIME FOR MORE STATE CONTROL</strong></p> <p>Now there is a dangerous argument doing the rounds about how we do that. You may have heard it. I have to tell you, Labour are clutching at it as some sort of intellectual lifeline. It goes like this. In these times of difficulty, we need a bigger state. Not just in a financial and economic sense, but in a social sense too. A Labour minister said something really extraordinary last week. It revealed a huge amount about them. David Miliband said that \"unless government is on your side you end up on your own.\" \"On your own\" - without the government. I thought it was one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say.</p> <p>For Labour there is only the state and the individual, nothing in between. No family to rely on, no friend to depend on, no community to call on. No neighbourhood to grow in, no faith to share in, no charities to work in. No-one but the Minister, nowhere but Whitehall, no such thing as society - just them, and their laws, and their rules, and their arrogance. You cannot run our country like this.</p> <p>It is why, when we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader; it's Labour. They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency. This attitude, this whole health and safety, human rights act culture, has infected every part of our life. If you're a police officer you now cannot pursue an armed criminal without first filling out a risk assessment form. Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first aid officer. Even foreign exchanges for students\u2026you can't host a school exchange any more without parents going through an Enhanced Criminal Record Bureau Check.</p> <p>No, when times are tough, it's not a bigger state we need: it's better, more efficient government. But even more than that we need a stronger society. That means trusting people. And sharing responsibility.</p> <p><strong>NEW POLITICS</strong></p> <p>But no-one will ever take lectures from politicians about responsibility unless we put our own house in order. That means sorting out our broken politics. People are sick of it. Sick of the sleaze, sick of the cynicism. Copper-bottomed pensions. Plasma screen TVs on the taxpayer. Expenses and allowances that wouldn't stand for one second in the private sector.</p> <p>This isn't a Conservative problem, a Labour problem or a Liberal Democrat problem. It is a Westminster problem, and we've all got to sort it out. In the end, this is about the judgment to see how important this issue is for the credibility of politics and politicians. And it's about having the character to take on vested interests inside your own party.</p> <p>That's what I have done. The first to say: MPs voting on their pay, open-ended final salary pension schemes, the John Lewis list \u2013 they have all got to go. And it's no different in Europe. We've drawn up a hard-hitting code of conduct for our MEPs. With European elections next year, the message to them is simple: If you don't sign, you won't stand. And while we're on this subject, there's one other thing that destroys trust in politics. And that's parties putting things in their manifesto and then doing the complete opposite. Next year in those European elections we will campaign with all our energy for that referendum on the European constitution that Labour promised but never delivered. Taking responsibility is how we will mend our broken politics. And sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals is how we will improve our public services.</p> <p><strong>NHS</strong></p> <p>Let's be straight about what's happened to our NHS. Money has been poured in but maternity wards and A&amp;E departments are closing. Productivity is down. The nurses and doctors are disillusioned, frustrated, angry and demoralised. I know from personal experience just how brilliant and dedicated the people who work in the NHS are. But they have been terribly, terribly let down.</p> <p>Instead of a serious long-term reform plan for the NHS working out how we can deliver a free national health service in an age of rising expectations and rising healthcare costs, never mind the rocketing costs of social care, we've had eleven years of superficial, short-term tinkering. Top-down target after top-down target, with another thirty seven targets added last year. Endless bureaucratic re-organisations, some of them contradictory, others abandoned after just a few months. Labour have taken our most treasured national institution, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers.</p> <p>In August, I got a letter from one of my constituents, John Woods. His wife was taken to hospital. She caught MRSA and she died. Some of the incidents described are so dreadful, and so degrading, that I can't read you most of the letter. He says the treatment his wife received \"was like something out of a 17th century asylum not a 21st century \u00a390 billion health service.\" And then, as his wife's life was coming to end, he remembers her \"sitting on the edge of her bed in distress and saying 'I never thought it would be like this'.\" I sent the letter to Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary.</p> <p>This was his reply.<br>\"A complaints procedure has been established for the NHS to resolve concerns\u2026<br>\"Each hospital and Primary Care Trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service to support people who wish to make a complaint\u2026<br>\"There is also an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service\u2026<br>\"If, when Mr Woods has received a response, he remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to approach the Healthcare Commission and seek an independent review of his complaint and local organisation's response\u2026<br>\"Once the Health Care Commission has investigated the case he can approach the Health Service Ombudsman if he remains dissatisfied\u2026.\"</p> <p>A Healthcare Commission. A Health Service Ombudsman. A Patient Advice and Liaison Service. An Independent Complaints Advocacy Service. Four ways to make a complaint but not one way for my constituent's wife to die with dignity. We need to change all that.</p> <p>But here is the plain truth. We will not bring about long-term change if we think that all we have to do is stick with what Labour leave us and just pump some more money in. Instead of those targets and directives that interfere with clinical judgments we'll publish the information about what actually happens in the NHS. We'll give patients an informed choice about where to go for their care so doctors stop answering to Whitehall, and start answering to patients. This way, the health service can at last become exactly that: a service not a take it or leave it bureaucracy. I'm afraid Labour have had their chance to show they can be trusted with the NHS, and they have failed. We are the party of the NHS in Britain today and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL REFORM</strong></p> <p>But if you want to know what I really hope we will achieve in government. If you want to know where the change will be greatest from what has gone before. It is our plan for social reform. The central task I have set myself and this Party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform. That's how we plan to repair our broken society.</p> <p><strong>BROKEN SOCIETY</strong></p> <p>I know this is a controversial argument. Some say our society isn't broken. I wonder what world they live in. Leave aside that almost two million children are brought up in households where no one works. Or that there are housing estates in Britain where people have a lower life expectancy than in the Gaza Strip. Just consider the senseless, barbaric violence on our streets. Children killing children. Twenty-seven kids murdered on the streets of London this year. A gun crime every hour. A serious knife crime every half hour. A million victims from alcohol related-attacks.</p> <p>But it's not just the crime; not even the anti-social behaviour. It's the angry, harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us. When in one generation we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role - a responsibility - to uphold rules and order in the public realm not just for their own children but for other people's too.</p> <p>Helen Newlove spoke to us yesterday. I can't tell you how much I've been moved by working with Helen over the past year. This woman, whose husband Garry was brutally kicked to death on her own doorstep This woman, who had to explain to her beautiful children that their father was not coming home from the hospital, not ever, because he had dared to be a good, responsible citizen.</p> <p>Helen Newlove knows our society is broken. But she believes we can repair it \u2013 and so do I. The big question is how. And here is where we need some very plain speaking. There are those who say \u2013 and there are many in this hall \u2013 that what is required is tough punishment, longer sentences and more prison places. And to a degree, they're right. We'll never mend the broken society without a clear barrier between right and wrong, and harsh penalties when you cross the line.</p> <p>But let's recognise, once and for all, that such an approach only deals with the symptoms, picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before. Come with me to Wandsworth prison and meet the inmates. Yes you meet the mugger, the robber and the burglar. But you also meet the boy who can't read and never could. The teenager hooked on heroin. The young man who never knew the love of a father. The middle aged failure where no-one in the family has known what it's like to go out and work for two generations or maybe more. Miss the context, miss the cause, miss the background and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.</p> <p>There are those who say that all of this \u2013 mending the broken society - will require state action, state programmes and state money. And to a degree, they are right too. We are not an anti-state party. In the twentieth century, state-run social programmes had real success in fighting poverty and making our society stronger. Pensions, sickness benefits, state education: I honour those men and women of all parties and none who created these safety nets and springboards. But today, the returns from endless big state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing. That's because too often, state intervention deals with the symptoms of the problem. I want us to be different: to deal with the long-term causes. That will be the test of our character and judgment.</p> <p><strong>FAMILIES</strong></p> <p>First, families. If we sincerely care about children's futures, then all families, however organised, need our help and support. So I don't have some idealised, rose-tinted view of the family. I know families can be imperfect. I get the modern world.</p> <p>But I think that in our modern world, in these times of stress and anxiety the family is the best welfare system there is. That's why I want to scrap Labour's plans for a new army of untrained outreach workers so we can have over 4,000 extra health visitors and guarantees of family visits before and after your child is born. To those who say this is some sort of nanny state I say: nonsense.</p> <p>Remember what it was like the first few nights after your first child is born, the worry, the uncertainly, the questions. Health visitors are a lifeline \u2013 and I want more of them. It's because I want to strengthen families that I support flexible working. To those who say this is some intolerable burden on business, I say \"wrong\". Business pays the costs of family breakdown in taxes \u2013 and isn't it right that everyone, including business, should play their part in making Britain a more family-friendly country? Do you know what, if we don't change these antiquated business practices then women half the talent of the country are just put off from joining the workforce.</p> <p>We will also back marriage in the tax system. To those who say\u2026why pick out marriage why do you persist in aggravating people who for whatever reason choose not to get married I say I don't want to aggravate anyone, but I believe in commitment and many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me anymore, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times and that's something we should cherish as a society.</p> <p><strong>SCHOOLS</strong></p> <p>When families fail, school is the way we can give children a second chance. My passion about this is both political and personal. After the 2005 election, shadow education secretary was the job I asked for in the Shadow Cabinet and Michael Howard kindly let me have it. I'm not sure my reshuffles work quite like that, but there we are. He's a very kind man and was a great leader of our party. But it's personal because I'm the father of three young children \u2013 and I worry about finding good schools for them more than anything else.</p> <p>There's nothing quite like that feeling when you watch your children wandering across the playground, school bag in one hand, packed lunch in the other, knowing they're safe, they're happy, they've got a great teacher in a good school. But the straightforward truth is that there aren't enough good schools, particularly secondary schools, particularly in some of our bigger towns and cities. Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure. That's why Michael Gove has such radical plans to establish 1,000 New Academies, with real freedoms, like grant maintained schools used to have. And that's why, together, we will break open the state monopoly and allow new schools to be set up. And to those who say we cannot wait for structural reform and competition to raise standards I say - yes, you're right, and we will not wait.</p> <p>The election of a Conservative government will bring \u2013 and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the educational establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the \"all must win prizes\" philosophy and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.</p> <p>Listen to this. It's the President of the Spelling Society. He said, and I quote, \"people should be able to use whichever spelling they prefer.\" He's the President of the Spelling Society. Well, he's wrong. And by the way, that's spelt with a 'W.'</p> <p>And then there's the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. These are the people who are officially supposed to maintain standards in our school system. You pay their wages. And do you know what you get in return? They let a child get marks for writing \"F off\" as an answer in an exam. As Prime Minister I'd have my own two words for people like that, and yes, one of them does begin with an 'F'. You're fired.</p> <p><strong>WELFARE</strong></p> <p>If strengthening families is the first line of defence against social breakdown, and school reform is the second \u2013 then welfare reform is the full, pitched battle. This problem goes very deep \u2013 and dealing with it will be very tough. There are almost five million people in Britain of working age who are out of work and on benefits. That's bad for them. It's bad for our society. And it's bad for our economy. Decades ago, when we had a universal collective culture of respect for work, a system of unconditional benefits was good and right and effective. But if we're going to talk straight we've got to admit something.</p> <p>That culture doesn't exist any more. In fact, worse than that, the benefit system itself encourages a benefit culture, and sends some pretty perverse messages. It's not even that it's picking up the pieces and treating the symptoms, rather than providing a cure. Today, it is actively making the problem worse.</p> <p>So we will end the something for nothing culture. If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, you lose benefits. Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits. Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them. I spent some time recently sitting with a benefit officer in a Job Centre plus. In came a young couple. She was pregnant. He was the dad. They were out of work and trying to get somewhere to live. The benefit officer didn't really have much choice but to explain that they would be better off if she lived on her own. What on earth are we doing with a system like that? With the money we save by ending the something for nothing welfare culture we will say to that couple in that benefit office: Stay together, bring up your kid, build your family, we're on your side and we will end that couple penalty.</p> <p><strong>PROGRESSIVE ENDS, CONSERVATIVE MEANS</strong></p> <p>In all these ways, and with the inspiring help of Iain Duncan Smith, we have made the modern Conservative Party the party of social justice. The party that says yes: we can build a society where anyone can rise from the bottom to the top with nothing in their way but only if we put in place radical Conservative school reform to do it.</p> <p>Yes: we can build a society where we end the scandal of child poverty and give every child the decent start they deserve but only if we have radical Conservative welfare reform to achieve it. This is the big argument in British politics today, an argument through which we show that in this century as we have shown in the centuries that went before with Peel, with Shaftesbury, with Disraeli, when the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised, for the people whom David Davis so vividly described as the victims of state failure, when the call comes to expand hope and broaden horizons it is this Party, the Conservative Party it is our means, Conservative means that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.</p> <p><strong>READY FOR CHANGE</strong></p> <p>Progressive ends; Conservative means. That is a big argument about the future. That is a big change. And it is because we had the courage to change that we are able to make it. We changed because knew we had to make ourselves relevant to the twenty-first century. You didn't pick more women candidates to try and look good you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent and fail to come up with the policies that modern families need. You didn't champion green politics as greenwash but because climate change is devastating our environment because the energy gap is a real and growing threat to our security and because $100-a-barrel oil is hitting families every time they fill up their car and pay their heating bills.</p> <p>You didn't take international development seriously because it was fashionable but because it is a true reflection of the country we live in, a Britain that is outward-looking, internationalist and generous and because this Party that has always believed in one nation must in this century be a Party of one world. This is who we are today and those who say the Tories haven't changed totally underestimate the capacity this Party has always had to pick itself up, turn itself around and make itself relevant to the challenges of the hour. Those who say we haven't changed just show how little they have changed.</p> <p><strong>A UNITED PARTY</strong></p> <p>We are a changed party and we are a united party. We are making progress in the north in the south in the east and in the west. The first Conservative by-election gain from Labour in thirty years. The first Conservative metropolitan council in the North East in thirty four years. And the first Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. We are a united party, united in spirit and united in purpose. And we know that our task is to take people with us. Rebuilding our battered economy. Renewing our bureaucratised NHS. Repairing our broken society. That is our plan for change. But in these difficult times we promise no new dawns, no overnight transformations. I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.</p> <p><strong>A UNITED COUNTRY</strong></p> <p>These difficult times need leadership, yes. They need character and judgment. The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team. The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough. The judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made and to offer the country change. Leadership, character, judgment. That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.</p> <p>I know we are living in difficult times but I am still optimistic because I have faith in human nature in our remarkable capacity to innovate, to experiment, to overcome obstacles and to find a way through difficulties whether those problems are created by man or nature.</p> <p>We can and will come through. We always do. Not because of our government. But because of the people of Britain. Because of what you do \u2013 because of the work you do, the families you raise, the jobs you create because of your attitude, your confidence and your determination. So because we are united\u2026 Because we have had the courage to change. Because we have the fresh answers to the challenges of our age.</p> <p>I believe we now have the opportunity, and more than that the responsibility, to bring our country together. Together in the face of this financial crisis. Together in determination that we will come through it. Together in the hope, the belief that better times will lie ahead.</p>",
  "<p>Back before the days of television, the BBC used to broadcast its main news bulletin on the radio. It seems incredible to say this, but at 9pm on certain nights the 'news' would consist of the following words: \"There is no news today.\" In preparation for this week's column I have been thinking a great deal about such plain, bald language. With an acknowledged debt to the great broadcasting corporation, I feel I must vandalise the statement for the start of the 2008-2009 NHL campaign.</p> <p>There is no news this season.</p> <p>There is no news because when it comes to determining which set of grizzled, bruised and bearded men will hoist the design classic that is the Stanley Cup next summer, it's difficult to see past the Detroit Red Wings. It is of course true that in more than a decade no team has repeated the trick of winning consecutive championships, but the last team to do it were, of course, the Wings. Ten years and three and three quarter months since hockey's own Big Red Machine became the last men skating for the second successive June, I have brought together every tenet of my analytical and predictive skills (ingredients: guesswork, prejudice, arrogance, foolhardiness) to predict the following: the Detroit Red Wings will more than likely win this year's Stanley Cup.</p> <p>I know, I know, it's boring; but who really would bet more than a pint against the club from the Motor City? The Wings really do seem to have everything. Crucially, in Mike Babcock behind the bench they have a man with sufficient smarts and authority to escape the shadow of Scotty Bowman, the 'winningest' coach in NHL history. Bowman led the Wings to three Stanley Cups in just six years, and his retirement in 2002 hit the city's hockey fans like a ton of ice. Detroit usually contend, but it took Babcock (a man who looks like a homicide detective who's just accidentally downed a urine sample) to once more harness his players into a team that performs at a level that is higher than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>Not that these parts are at all bad, mind. Joining Lidstrom, Zetterberg, Datsyuk, Maltby and Draper this year is Marion Hossa. The Czech-born right-wing has arrived from the Pittsburgh Penguins, a move that not only strengthens the wrists of the Western Conference side but weakens those of their Eastern Conference rivals. I suppose goaltending <em>might</em> be a weakness in Motown, but even this is merely a theory. During last season's playoffs, the ageing Chris Osgood played like the superstar he's never been credited as being, proving that hockey on a sheet of paper cannot compare to the game on a sheet of ice.</p> <p>Because I have nothing to report regarding the team that will win it all, I feel that I should put in a double shift elsewhere in order that I can at least try and make a fool of myself. So I predict that the Red Wings will be joined in next May's Stanley Cup Finals by the Philadelphia Flyers, and that the Michigan ... er ... ans will triumph in six games. I predict that the Wings will defeat the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Final, and that the Flyers will oust the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference equivalent. I could try to predict the number of games of each series, but I don't want to abuse my gift.</p> <p>For hockey to have winners it must by definition also have losers \u2014 much more my kind of thing. So I predict the Pittsburgh Penguins will have a disappointing year (they will reach the second round of the playoffs) and the Anaheim Ducks will have a bad one, relatively speaking. I fear that the New York Rangers will struggle (and may even miss the post-season entirely) and I suspect that the much vaunted Tampa Bay Lightning will be hugely entertaining but not wholly effective. The reason for this is that the Florida club looks a lot better at the front than it does at the back, much like coach <a href=\"http://weblogs.newsday.com/sports/watchdog/blog/nhl_g_melros.jpg\">Barry Melrose's hair</a>.</p> <p>If the following predictions prove to be correct, this will of course mean that I am a genius (regular readers of this column might have suspected this anyway). If I'm proved wrong \u2014 no, no, it is possible \u2014 then consider this: I am a London-based hockey writer for whom a live NHL game is not possible without a side-order of jet-lag. Really, what the hell do I know? And what kind of crazy person would listen to me anyway?</p> <p>Thing is, though, I really don't care so much about the destination as I do the journey itself. This is the advantage of writing about the National Hockey League as a whole rather than any one team in particular. Were I the beat writer for the New York Islanders (bloody hell, imagine that) then I would want the league's Long Island branch to do well. Since geography has afforded me a wider palate, I find myself simply wanting hockey to do well. If that sounds a bit pat, let me add the following qualification: I also want the Toronto Maple Leafs to do badly. Why? Because it's so very entertaining.</p> <p>Basically, my hopes for the next eight months or so are simple: that the upcoming season continues in the same manner as its predecessor, a campaign so successful that even those who seem to take delight in predicting hockey's demise \u2014 most notably, the features desk of Sports Illustrated magazine \u2014 were forced to admit that it was a peach. Television ratings were up, high-definition broadcasts made the game easier to follow (look, a puck!), the post-lockout rule changes made the game better to watch and the salary cap saw competitive teams take to the ice in most NHL cities (with apologies to readers in Columbus, Miami and, yes, Toronto).</p> <p>I am, of course, painting in very broad strokes, but for the first season in years I find myself more optimistic with regards to hockey's health than I was 12 months previously. The National Hockey League has all manner of problems to contend with, but it also has reason for good cheer. We'll be examining both the plus and minus columns in the months to come. In the meantime, I'm off to Stockholm on Saturday to see the Rangers play the Lightning. Brendan Shanahan and Barry Melrose await.</p> <p>The summer is over, winter is coming, and a brand new NHL season is a mere three days away. Perhaps you'll agree, it hasn't come a moment too soon.</p> <h2>Postscript</h2> <p>It would be remiss of me not to mention the passing of Paul Newman, who died last weekend. For this column, it is the actor's portrayal of journeyman hockey player Reggie Dunlop in the 1977 film Slapshot for which he will be best remembered. The story of an ailing, failing minor league club (the Charlestown Chiefs), the picture so perfectly defines the term 'cult classic' that one wonders how the phrase earned its keep prior to the movie's release. If you're unfamiliar with Slapshot I urge you to rectify this situation at your earliest convenience. It is to hockey what This Is Spinal Tap is to rock music. Compliments don't come much higher than that.</p>",

  "<p>An ocean-going African fishing boat carrying 229 migrants became the largest ever vessel to reach the Canary Islands yesterday on the popular but dangerous illegal immigration route from the coast of west Africa. </p> <p>Spanish frontier police spotted the brightly painted vessel 55 miles off the coast of Gran Canaria and transferred the immigrants to a maritime patrol boat before taking them to the port at Los Cristianos on the island of Tenerife.</p> <p>\"We have never seen anything like it before,\" said Juan Antonio Corujo, the head of the Red Cross in the Canaries. \"They looked like a crowd at a demonstration.\" </p> <p>The migrants were reported to have come from several African countries and included more than 20 children.</p> <p>They told police that the 28-metre vessel, shaped like a large open canoe, had set out from the Mauritanian port of Nouadhibou. It had taken four days and nights to cross the often treacherous stretch of Atlantic Ocean that separates the islands from west Africa.</p> <p>Several people were suffering hypothermia on arrival and had to be carried ashore on stretchers.</p> <p>\"Such a large fishing boat could not have set off from the shore directly into the sea,\" Mr Corujo said. \"This boat must have been loaded from a pier or probably smaller boats took people to the boat once it was at sea.\" </p> <p>Red Cross sources in Nouadhibou said an unprecedented number of migrants had arrived in the port city in recent days from other parts of Mauritania and west Africa.</p> <p>Another boat carrying 100 migrants reached Gran Canaria yesterday and many more could be expected over the coming days, according to the Red Cross in Mauritania.</p> <p>The largest vessel to reach the Canary Islands on the immigrant route from west Africa before yesterday had carried 180 people.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of migrants have reached the Canaries by boat in recent years. Hundreds of others have drowned, or died of thirst or exposure, on the trip, which can take up to two weeks.</p> <p>Spain has managed to cut numbers since a peak two years ago - mainly through policing and cooperation agreements with west African nations. A radar system has been installed on the Canaries that detects many immigrant vessels well before they reach shore.</p> <p>Spain's interior ministry says arrivals are down 8% this year and by more than 60% compared with 2006.</p> <p>The interior minister, Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, told parliament yesterday that Spain had repatriated 101 planeloads of illegal immigrants so far this year.</p>",

  "<p>It was the most memorable thing about an extraordinary day. Every place I visited in Katine sub-county with the then vice-chairman of Barclays, Gary Hoffman, we were greeted by music.</p> <p>Young men played on instruments that had been made locally, such as thumb pianos, drums and xylophones and a one stringed violin called an endigidi. They sung a combination of traditional welcome songs and others they had composed specially for the occasion. I kept catching snatches of chorus with both the Guardian and Barclays referenced.</p> <p>Young men dominated the bands, while women and girls did most of the dancing. The latter took part in elaborate formal group dancing, in which around a dozen girls in school uniform would go through complex steps, sashaying in time to the music.</p> <p>Together, the music and the dance revealed the extraordinary cultural riches that are within access of even those living in such a poor place as Katine. They may struggle to survive and often their children go to bed hungry, but at the same time, they participate in, and draw from, a wealth of creativity that would be a sharp contrast with many a computer-raised child in the west.</p> <p>It was these images which came back to me when I <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/01/worldmusic.uganda\">interviewed Nigel Osborne</a></strong>, one of the UK's leading composers, who has just completed a project in the remote island of Lolui, on Lake Victoria, Uganda.</p> <p>Osborne has collaborated on musical projects for children traumatised by war all over the world, and believes passionately that music can heal. He has worked in Bosnia, Chechnya and Palestine; now he is looking to develop work in Uganda. It makes sense given that this African country has one of the <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/jun/05/development.uganda\">highest rates of post-traumatic stress</a></strong> in the world.</p> <p>Shortly after talking to Osborne, I was interviewing Grace Mukasa, the UK head of programmes for Amref in London. She was stressing how the single most important factor in the Katine project was building trust. It was a community that had been so devastated by the incursions in 2003 and subsequent cattle rustling that the communal structures of collaboration have been worn to a thread. Music, she agreed, could play a huge role in helping build trust again. </p> <p>It brings delight and joy into even the most unpropitious of circumstances, maintains Osborne, and he even went as far as to say that music is one of the most important priorities for post-conflict resolution. Even in the muddiest refugee camp, if you can get people playing music you start to trigger the conditions in which people can rebuild their lives. It rekindles dignity, confidence, hope and it affirms identity.</p> <p>Osborne points out that Uganda has no less than seven major musical traditions. It reflects the enormous variety of the ethnic make up of this country, which has played such a key role in causing conflict in the 40 years since independence. But his idea is that if you could facilitate musicians sharing and participating in each other's musical traditions you could build trust and better understanding. Music could even be a path to the nation building that has proved so elusive in Uganda.</p> <p>Intriguingly, Osborne points to the biggest divide in Uganda between the Nilotic-speaking peoples of the north of Uganda, who look towards southern Sudan, and the Bantu speaking people of the south whose linguistic cousins spread all the way to southern Africa: language and literacy only accentuate the big cultural differences on either side of this divide \u2013 one of the biggest in Africa. But the musical traditions in fact have much more in common, Osborne explains. There are differences, but they share a \"central element in controlling structure\" and they use many of the same instruments.</p> <p>Osborne believes that music can often prove to be a form of communication that is more effective at promoting social change and reconciliation, so he is now looking to see how to work in Uganda. A new Ugandan NGO is planning to work with him in Kitgum, in the north, where there are many children traumatised by their experiences of being abducted and forced to become child soldiers. He didn't rule out working in Katine if it could be arranged.</p> <p>Come along on Wednesday October 8, to Kings Place, near King's Cross in London, and you can listen to Osborne talking about his work in Uganda, see a new film about the role of music in Katine and also hear from Grace Mukasa in an evening event chaired by Jon Snow. Tickets are \u00a39.50 online from www.kingsplace.co.uk</p> <p>It will be an occasion to celebrate Katine as we approach the end of our first anniversary.</p>",

  "<p>A suspected US drone killed at least six people in a missile strike in the Pakistani tribal region of North Waziristan near the Afghan border, officials said today.<br> The strike came amid reports that Pakistan's top Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, had died after illness. Pakistani officials have accused Mehsud over the assassinated of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto after her return from exile. Two missiles were fired at a house in the Khushali Torikhel area near Mir Ali town at about midnight, according to local media reports. Pakistani intelligence officials said the missiles struck the home of a local Taliban commander. The officials said a US drone aircraft \u2014 not Pakistani forces \u2014 fired the missiles. Pakistani media reported that among the dead were foreign militants. It was reported that the drone returned fire as it was attacked while hovering over a village. In recent weeks American forces have crossed the border in missions aimed at destroying Taliban and al-Qaida bases in Pakistan. </p> <p>These so-called hot pursuits have provoked anger in Pakistan \u2014 especially the raid last month that saw US ground troops enter South Waziristan, the stronghold of Mehsud, the head of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, an umbrella group for militant groups operating in north-west Pakistan.<br> Mehsud has built up a loyal and fanatical following, and news of his death had spread quickly through the country. However, a close aide to Mehsud, Ibrahim Burqi, told Reuters that Mehsud was sick some time ago but had recovered. \"Rumours about his death are being spread to weaken the Tehrik-e-Taliban,\" Burqi said by telephone from an undisclosed location.  The new Pakistani government has insisted that only its forces can operate inside the country \u2014 and to emphasise its sovereignty the army has opened fire at US helicopters that have entered the country's airspace. American officials have voiced frustration at Pakistan's failure to kill or capture militant leaders \u2014 including Osama bin Laden \u2014 who send militants and arms into Afghanistan where foreign troop casualties are escalating. In an interview with the New York Times, General David Petraeus, who is leaving his command of forces in Iraq about to become head of the US Central Command, said making headway in both Afghanistan and Pakistan would require taking away militant sanctuaries and strongholds that the insurgents would defend tenaciously. \"In both places, in certain areas, the going may be tougher before it gets easier,\" he said. Pakistan's army chief on Monday appointed a new head of the country's spy service, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, which has been blamed in both India and Afghanistan for being behind the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul that left 54 dead.</p> <p>A secret Spanish military intelligence report leaked to a radio station also accuses Pakistan's intelligence services of helping Taliban forces in Afganistan carry out their attacks.</p> <p>The report, dated 2005, claims that the ISI directorate was helping the Taliban obtain a new kind of remote-controlled bomb called \"Night and Day\".</p> <p>It also suggests that Pakistan intelligence officials may have been training and passing intelligence on to the Taliban.</p>",
  "<p>By this stage in the political-electoral cycle it would be reasonable to assume that a coherent international policy would be on offer from the Conservative party. Yet as ambassadors and international observers turn up in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Birmingham</a> they will find prejudice in place of policy and a revival of the worst failures of both John Major's and Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy still embedded in Tory thinking.</p> <p>Compared to 1995 or 1996, when Tony Blair and Robin Cook had completely reshaped Labour's international rhetoric to ditch the Euroscepticism of the 1980s and the hostility to open trade of the Labour left as well as promoting a strong pro-American partnership, today's Tories have not the hard thinking about what to do if they take control of Britain's foreign policy.</p> <p>The latest example is the promise by David Cameron, repeated over the weekend by William Hague, to hold a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4837174.ece\">referendum</a> on the all-but-defunct Lisbon treaty. The Irish no vote could in theory be overcome but even the most pro-EU of Irish observers think that if a second referendum were to be held the Irish no would be even stronger.</p> <p>In 2009, the EU presidency is held first by the Czech Republic then by Sweden. Neither Prague nor Stockholm have ratified the Lisbon treaty nor give much indication they will. Poland's president Kaczynski is also refusing to sign the treaty.</p> <p>Yet Cameron and Hague are insisting on a referendum on a dead parrot. Their cynical tactic is obvious \u2013 to corral the anti-European votes which might go to UKIP or the BNP. But to commit the first year of a putative Tory government to the passage of a referendum bill and then the organisation of a giant fiesta of anti-European hate in which the tabloids, the BNP, UKIP and the Better-Off-Out Tories can indulge into their xenophobic rhetoric seems an odd choice.</p> <p>The no camp will win but only to say no to what is not going to happen. Across Europe and in Washington, partners and allies will look aghast at the frivolity of Britain indulging in such pointless plebiscite politics. And since Cameron cannot deliver what UKIP, Open Europe and many of his MPs want \u2013 a withdrawal of Britain to the status of Norway outside the EU, he will just make Britain's look foolish as Sarkozy and Merkel and other serious centre-right leaders take over the leadership of Europe and marginalise Britain.</p> <p>Cameron's other major foreign policy speech was to denounce the politics of interventionism. The difficulties and controversy over Iraq are well known, but the major theatre of interventionism today is Afghanistan, where Britain and allies are trying to stop Taliban Islamist terrorists win power and in parallel move in for the ultimate al-Qaida and Islamist jihadi goal \u2013 control of Pakistan and a fundamentalist finger on Pakistan's nuclear button. Already the <a href=\"http://www.conservativemuslimforum.com/\">Conservative Muslim Forum</a> has called for support for Iran's drive to get nuclear weapons and has said a Tory government should lessen support for Israel. Is that Cameron's policy?</p> <p>The failure to intervene in the Balkans and Rwanda by John Major remains a blot on British foreign policy. A million asylum seekers left the former Yugoslavia because the Conservatives failed to stand up to and face down Milosevic. Not all interventions work but to rule out interventionism on principle, as Cameron appears to have done takes us back to the worst failures of recent Tory foreign policy.</p> <p>The small \"c\" conservative London establishment of ex-ambassadors are united in their view that Russia's invasion, occupation and dismemberment of Georgia has to be lived with and that, in the words of <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/Russia/article/Reading-Russia-Rewiring-the-West\">Roderic Lyne</a>, a former UK ambassador to Moscow, writing for OpenDemocracy, \"Nato enlargement has been a mistake from the beginning.\" This will strike a chill into the heart of the Poles and the Baltic States. It will also worry the Finns who are now looking seriously at Nato membership to gain extra security after Russia's military assault and establishment of military bases on Georgian territory. Finland, like Georgia won independence in 1918. Stalin snuffed out Georgia's freedom and Finland now worries that Russia wants to dictate the international relations of its close neighbours. David Cameron made a bellicose cold war speech in Tbilisi reminiscent of the more extravagant rightwing anti-Soviet rhetoric of the early Thatcher era but his policy of rejecting cooperation in the fraternity of centre-right governing parties in Europe runs counter to the accepted view that the best way to deal with Russia is to promote an integrated and united EU line on energy policy and on speaking as one to Putin.</p> <p>This week in Strasbourg at the autumn meeting of 600 MPs from 47 nations grouped in the Council of Europe, Cameron's foreign policy will come under pressure. Tory MPs have been backing the Kremlin's efforts to increase influence in Europe's human rights watchdog assembly. Earlier this year, Conservative MPs were promoting a former KGB staffer, now one of Putin's key aides in Russia's parliament, as president of the Council of Europe. Cameron's team back the Russian position on Kosovo against UK, American and EU policy. As with the odd pronouncements of the Conservative Muslim Forum it is not clear if Cameron and Hague actually know what Tory MPs and Peers get up to as representatives of their party at home and abroad.</p> <p>On transatlantic politics, Cameron, Hague and the Tory's defence spokesman, Liam Fox, appear determined to keep the spirit of Dick Cheney alive even as the Bush era becomes history. Both McCain and Obama have spoken of the need for partnership with Europe to tackle world instability. <a href=\"http://www.lordhowell.com/\">David Howell</a>, the Tory spokesman on foreign affairs in the Lords, and father-in-law of George Osborne, has spent the past 15 years writing that America is turning to Asia and is losing interest in Europe.</p> <p>Yet the opposite is the case. Whether on terrorism, on financial crises, on Afghanistan, on Turkey, on missile defence, on opening new bases in the Black Sea, we can see America is more involved with the wider Europe than ever before. When Nato was founded nearly 60 years ago, America worried about a small grouping of nations west of the Elbe. Now from the Caspian to the Atlantic, US interests are ever more co-mingled with Europe. To be sure, the rise of China and India herald a new future, but 60% of world GDP is concentrated in the Euroatlantic region and the Tory incantation that Europe does not matter any more make no sense in Washington or on Wall Street.</p> <p>Next year, the International Labour Organisation celebrates its 90th birthday. But the only available Tory policy on global social justice is the promise to take Britain out of its social charter obligations which have provided British workers with five week's paid holidays a year. As inequality rises to the top of the political agenda, Cameron wants to weaken such modest international work as it exists to promote social justice.</p> <p>The year 2009 also sees the 60th birthday of the Council of Europe which was brought into being by Winston Churchill's famous Zurich speech calling for European unity. Its most important achievement is the European convention on human rights and the setting up of the European court of human rights. But a number of senior Tories have called on Britain to withdraw from the ECHR with its obligation to accept refugees fleeing political and religious persecution. And Conservatives have never liked the rulings of the Council of Europe's human rights court banning violence against children (ie corporal punishment in schools) or upholding women's rights.</p> <p>Next year is also the 60th anniversary of Nato's founding. Today's Nato has to find a way of getting its European members more involved and more willing to share burdens and take risks. Cameron's hostility to European cooperation and party political partnership leaves Britain isolated and unable to influence the future direction of Nato, the EU and the Euroatlantic economic and security community.</p> <p>None of this will be debated at the Conservative conference in Birmingham. Never has a British political party prepared to ask voters to entrust it with government with such a wrongheaded foreign policy, which if implemented along the lines of current Tory rhetoric, would seriously Britain weaken.</p>"
