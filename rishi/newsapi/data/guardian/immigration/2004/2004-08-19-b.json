  "A white Texan politician is trying to win custody of the 20-month-old son of his African former maid, claiming that he and his wife want to help the boy because of \"the terrible problem that black male children have growing into manhood without being in prison\". <p>State representative Talmadge Heflin and his wife Jan ice made their case to a family court in Houston this week, accusing Mariam Katamba and her partner, Fidel Odimara, of not caring for their son or providing him with adequate medical care. </p> <p>Ms Katamba, who is from Uganda, and Mr Odimara, who is from Nigeria, say they love their child, have never abused him, and are being threatened by the Heflins be cause they are illegal immigrants. </p> <p>Ms Katamba moved in with the Heflins in July last year to work as their maid and then took on extra work outside of their home, but says she saw her son, Fidel, as often as she could. The Heflins say they took in the mother and child and cared for Fidel Jr when Ms Katamba was out at work. They say she worked all week and went out at weekends leaving the child with them. </p> <p>Ms Katamba denies that she went out at weekends. \"You pretended that you are helping me and now you are trying to take my kid away from me,\" she told the court. Mrs Heflin had offered to babysit for her after she found another job, she added,but she had never wanted to give him up. In an affidavit Ms Katamba added. \"They always take my child to Austin, Texas, whenever I'm off. When I protested about their denying me my child, they then brought the [case].\" </p> <p>In their documentary evidence the Heflins insist that Fidel Jr has spent most of his short life with them and that they \"are the only caregivers the child has known\". </p> <p>The issue came to a head last month when the Heflins gained temporary custody with a court order, saying that if the child were taken to either Uganda or Nigeria he might not receive adequate medical care for his asthma and heart murmur. </p> <p>They say they want temporary custody to ensure Fidel Jr's wellbeing and do not want to end the couple's parental rights. </p> <p>The African couple's lawyer, Matthew Nwogu, says the case is about returning a child to biological parents who are willing to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to care for him. </p> <p>Judge Linda Metheral adjourned the case to today to gather more information. </p> <p>\"[The child] sees us as his protectors, and we are,\" Mrs Heflin told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"We want him to know his parents but we also want him to be protected.\" </p> <p>Mr Odimara, who has rebutted claims made by the Heflins that he assaulted his wife while she was pregnant and has treated his son recklessly, told the hearing that the first-born child had a special significance in Nigerian culture. \"I want my son back,\" he said.</p>",
  "An Iraqi teenager was questioned by the police in Birmingham yesterday in connection with terrorism offences after being arrested by armed officers who kicked down his door as he slept. <p>The 19-year-old was arrested early yesterday morning in a house in the Selly Oak area. </p> <p>Two other men, aged 24 and 36, were arrested in connection with immigration offences. They are believed to have been living at the same address. </p> <p>West Midlands police said the teenager was arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. </p> <p>They said the investigation was not linked to the arrests a fortnight ago which resulted in eight men being charged with terrorism offences on Wednesday. </p> <p>They would not comment on reports that the teenager was an asylum seeker. </p> <p>Up to 20 officers, some from special branch, stormed the house in the residential area near Birmingham University. </p> <p>The man was taken from his bed and handcuffed, then taken to an undisclosed police station in the West Midlands. </p> <p>The police searched the house for hours afterwards. </p> <p>Witnesses said that the officers took several plastic bags full of items away to be examined. </p> <p>A next door neighbour, Diane Azmat, 61, said she was awakened shortly before 3.30am by the officers, including marksmen and dog handlers, breaking down the front door. </p> <p>\"I heard the most almighty crash of the front door being smashed open and then the most horrendous scream. </p> <p>\"It frightened me to death. There were dogs barking and police were all there with their guns.\" </p> <p>Another neighbour, Katherine, 22, a medical student, said: \"I looked out of my bedroom window ... and saw police standing around with riot gear on and guns. </p> <p>\"After a few minutes they knocked the front door down and stormed inside and three or four police in riot gear remained outside with guns pointed at the entrance. </p> <p>\"They were in there for half an hour ... then uniformed police went into the house and brought people out one by one. </p> <p>\"The first guy looked quite young and had four policeman surrounding him. </p> <p>\"They were bringing out plastic bags full of stuff into the early hours of the morning and we could see flashes of a camera, and this morning forensic people going in and out.\"</p>",
  "<p>The most innovative new music is being commissioned for Hollywood soundtracks. Joby Talbot, a modern composer who has scored the music for TV's The League of Gentlemen and arranged for The Divine Comedy, is currently at work on the soundtrack for a Disney film of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams' cult novel that informed the psyches of so many science-fiction-obsessed, bespectacled boys in need of a bit of fantasy in the early 1980s. </p> <p>For Talbot, the commission is a dream come true: he was such a boy. \"Some people can recite the Koran. I can recite The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" says Talbot, who has just woken up from a midday nap after a sleepless night caused by his two-year-old son. We are at his flat in Camberwell, southeast London, where Dr Seuss books sit alongside piles of DVDs and CDs. \"During meeting with the producers, somebody would mention a line and I would have to stop myself from reciting the whole scene for fear that they would assume I was a stalker. I can't quite believe I'm working on the film of it, which is going to be brilliant.\" </p> <p>Talbot occupies a unique place in music. He has been playing classical music since the age of four, when he picked up piano and oboe, and has studied at the Guildhall and worked with Michael Nyman. But he has also spent much of his adult life on the road with pop and rock bands, so he can see what the two distinct musical worlds can learn from one another. </p> <p>Modern classical composers could do with having a pop-style hook to hang a piece on, he claims; and pop and rock musicians could do with learning not to copy what has just been successful. \"The famous statement about classical music is that it's 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. I beg to differ. Having worked with all these pop musicians, I've realised that the initial inspiration is all-important. Too much concert music is based on technique and no idea. And pop music should try and appreciate originality a bit more.\" </p> <p>Talbot is currently preparing for his contribution to the Proms: a piece for the National Orchestra of Wales called Sneaker Waves performed on September 2. \"That's another lifetime dream come true. I spent my youth queuing to get in and daydreaming that one day, I might write a piece for the Proms myself. For a classical musician growing up in London, the Proms is the be-all and end-all; the greatest music festival in the world.\" </p> <p>At the age of nine, Talbot wrote his first piano piece. (\"It was rubbish, don't get carried away with praise about precociousness.\") A few years later, he had a moment of realisation that he wanted to be a composer. \"It's all very well deciding that, but the chances of making a living as a composer in this country are fairly remote. It's almost impossible to survive on writing concert music. A commission fee for writing music is nominal. You receive money when it is performed, but when you've spent six months writing your magnum opus string quartet and it gets performed in a village hall with 200 seats - once - that doesn't amount to much.\" </p> <p>Talbot survived by diversifying. Much of his music has been written in dank dressing rooms with water dripping from the ceiling in-between sound checks for pop concerts. \"My first big commission - a 45-minute orchestral piece - was written on the back of tour buses. It teaches you courage under fire and it's the opposite of sitting in an attic with a quill, waiting for the muse to descend. I would find that an arid and sterile environment in which to work. The isolation approach is very lonely and, dare I say it, rather boring.\" </p> <p>Of his record collection, Talbot is not proud. Van Halen and Aerosmith jostle for space alongside Mendelssohn and Vaughn Williams, and there are even albums that combine the two. \"My wife bought me a record player recently and I was very excited to dig out all my old teenage albums until I saw what they were,\" he says. \"I was really into Yes. I was hugely into War of the Worlds by Jeff Wayne. The bit that always got me is when they talk about the noises on the railway tracks. We lived by railway tracks in Mitcham and I lay awake at night listening to the spooky noises railway tracks make, so when I heard those noises turned into a piece of music I thought it was for me in particular. Also its narrator was Richard Burton, and he was my hero. I would watch The Medusa Touch with a pen and paper so that I could use some of the choice rude lines he came out with at opportune moments. But people like Yes and Jeff Wayne were trying to achieve the unachievable: to write a rock symphony. It simply cannot work. I don't know whose fault the whole thing is. I guess the Who are partially to blame.\" </p> <p>Mahler, Shostakovich and Stravinsky are among Talbot's favourite composers, and he discovered modern composers such as John Adams and Steve Reich at the age of 18. \"It was an angst-ridden teenage thing of liking that rather overwrought music,\" he says. \"I remember going to see a Mahler piece at the Royal Festival Hall and getting terribly over-excited and weeping. I thought that was what you were meant to do; that if you didn't leave the concert in tears then you should ask for your money back.\" </p> <p>It is the world of soundtracks, however, that Talbot sees as the most vital field of modern composition. \"Michael Danner's score for The Ice Storm is just amazing. Carter Burwell, who writes the Coen brothers' music, is brilliant, as is Thomas Newman, who wrote the music for American Beauty and Road to Perdition. The general music scene of the last few years has been pretty piss-poor. The only place to hear amazing, innovative music has been the cinema. You can see that by the fact that John Williams had to create a score as brilliant as Catch Me If You Can in order to keep up. We are in a soundtrack golden age.\"</p>",
  "If peace ever comes to Colombia after decades of civil war, it will come too late for three citizens of the oil-rich north-east region of Arauca, on the border with Venezuela. They were murdered by the army on August 5. The men were all trade unionists, and their killings bring to 30 the number of unionists killed in Arauca so far this year. <p>I met the men on a recent visit to Saravena, a town in Arauca at the epicentre of the government's security policies. Armed soldiers stood on every street corner. At a packed meeting, they and other trade unionists described the conditions they had struggled with after the President Alvaro Uribe designated their area a special security zone. Armoured cars cruised past the building, as though warning those inside that we were all being watched. </p> <p>The stories they told were of mass arrests, kidnappings, intimidation and murder. On one occasion, in November 2002, more than 2,000 people were rounded up at gunpoint and taken to the sports stadium where they were interrogated, photographed and marked with indelible ink. Hooded informers pointed out individuals, who were then arrested. The codename for this mass abuse of civil rights was Heroic Operation. </p> <p>Heroic Operation was an army undertaking, but civilian authorities cooperated: officials from the attorney general's office issued arrest warrants on the spot, on the word of the informers rather than any judicial investigation. Of the 2,000 rounded up, 85 were arrested. They were taken into detention, during which some were told they would be released if they agreed to become informers. Months later, 35 had been released for lack of evidence. When they finally returned home, many faced death threats from paramilitary groups. About 40 of the 50 who remained in detention were trade unionists. </p> <p>The returnees talked of the harassment they endured and the alarming death rate among civilians in Arauca who assumed any position of leadership. Teachers, health workers and union activists were being killed in appalling numbers. The latest three victims were prominent local union officials. The government claims they were guerrillas, but two had been under the special protection of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. </p> <p>Why has Arauca been singled out for \"enhanced\" security? One answer is oil. It is home to the Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n oilfield, which accounts for 30% of Colombia's oil production. The oil is pumped to the Caribbean through a pipeline that has been a major target for guerrilla forces. Now a complex mosaic of armed groups - rightwing paramilitaries and the army, often working closely together, and leftwing guerrillas - struggle for control of the lucrative pipeline and cocaine routes. </p> <p>The civil war is decades old but has grown more complex in recent years. Uribe was elected on a promise of security. The civilians of Arauca - farmers, oil workers, health workers and their families - bear the brunt of the conflict and need peace more than anybody, but for them Uribe's promises have proved hollow. The reality of the security zones poses the question of whose security they are designed to enhance. </p> <p>There are seven municipalities in the department of Arauca, but the special security zone was only imposed in the three northern municipalities where the oil pipeline runs. The four municipalities to the south are dominated by illegal far-right paramilitary groups, notorious for their abuses of the civilian population - but they were excluded. The supreme court ruled the security zones unconstitutional because of the extraordinary powers they gave to the security forces, but that did little to change the facts on the ground. Now they are designated rehabilitation and consolidation zones - little more than a change in name. </p> <p>These are tough times in Colombia and the government argues that tough measures are necessary. But key officials who look at whether these measures work point out that they are counterproductive. The Colombian human rights ombudsman and the procurator general reported that not only did human rights abuses increase, but the security situation in Arauca deteriorated after the special security zone was set up. There was a documented increase in abuses by the army and paramilitary groups, with no decrease in the danger to civilians posed by the guerrillas. </p> <p>The procurator general's report on Arauca said: \"Neither the increase in military personnel, the strategy of informers or that of peasant soldiers has had the expected results. On the contrary, they have led to other difficulties [such as] the exposure of the civilian population to greater risk.\" </p> <p>It may be a different matter, of course, for an oil company. Occidental Petroleum, which operates in Arauca, has funded the army's controversial 18th Brigade, the main army force in the department. The US government also funds the 18th Brigade, apparently unconcerned that it has been accused of abuses against civilians and of cooperation with paramilitaries. </p> <p>Last year, the US gave Colombia $99m to protect the pipeline, to be split between the 18th Brigade and a new mobile unit. President Bush also sent 60 US special forces personnel to Arauca to train the brigade. Given this involvement of the oil companies and the US government in the brigade's activities, perhaps they can explain something the Colombian government does not care to: how does it enhance the security of the people of Arauca when the army, directly or through its collaboration with paramilitary groups, targets health workers, trade unionists, teachers, journalists and human rights defenders and forcibly displaces indigenous and peasant communities who lived near the pipeline?</p> <p>A year ago, in a meeting in London, Colombia's vice-president signed a commitment to implement a long list of recommendations from the UN Human Rights Commission. Twelve months on, the UN reports that there has been almost no progress on most of the recommendations, and on others Colombia has moved backwards. The Colombian government claims that the vice-president's signature did not commit the country to anything - an approach to commitments that Colombia's partners might care to bear in mind in future dealings with the Uribe government. </p> <p>Uribe denounces the UN view as foreign interference in Colombia's affairs. Human rights organisations - including Amnesty International - that protest against army abuses are labelled terrorist sympathisers by the president himself. At the same time, Colombia hopes for other kinds of foreign interference - the kind that pours money into military coffers (as Britain does through bilateral military aid) and no-questions-asked funding and investment. The people of Colombia need investment, but more urgently they need a security policy that genuinely enhances their security. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:isabel.hilton@theguardian.com\">isabel.hilton@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of jobs seem likely to be lost at consumer goods group Unilever as it seeks to further integrate its three British business units. </p> <p>The producer of Surf washing powder and Birds Eye frozen foods announced similar moves in Holland on Wednesday as it works to wards having one operating company per country. </p> <p>\"This is all part of our efforts to simplify the structure of the business under our path for growth strategy,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>Asked whether it would inevitably lead to redundancies, he said: \"It is likely that there will be some jobs to go.\" </p> <p>Unilever said it was too early to say how many, as the process was getting under way. Sources said it would probably involve hundreds, not thousands, of the firm's 12,500 British staff. </p> <p>A news release announcing the Dutch reorganisation made clear that compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out. Across the globe it is hoped to produce savings of \u20ac700m (\u00a3470m) a year by the end of 2006. </p> <p>Unilever - poised for management change with the departure of chairman Niall FitzGerald at the end of September - has three British business units. </p> <p>These are the personal care and household products group Lever Faberg\u00e9, Unilever Bestfoods and the former Birds Eye Walls, which has been renamed Unilever Ice Cream and Frozen Foods. </p> <p>These three businesses will retain their marketing and sales staff but more administrative functions will be transferred to a central location. </p> <p>Human resources, information technology and finance functions are among those facing a shake-up. </p> <p>Andrew Saunders, an analyst at Numis Securities, said it was no surprise the company was trying to cut more costs. </p> <p>\"Shareholders have been disappointed over the last 12 months and so would want to see the new broom come in and look at the business in a different way and find new ways of improving margins,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>World oil prices set yet another record yesterday as fighting continued in Iraq and new figures showed a global economy as yet unbowed by dearer energy and demand continuing to be strong. </p> <p>The renewed surge triggered angry denials from the oil sector that companies had failed to invest in new assets as a ploy to keep prices high. </p> <p>US light crude marched 60 cents a barrel higher to a record of $47.35 before dropping back on profit-taking and reports that rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr had agreed to end an uprising in the city of Najaf. </p> <p>Brent crude rose 40 cents to $43.40 before also succumbing to a spate of selling, which pushed it back under the $43 a barrel level. </p> <p>US crude prices have set a record in all but one of the last 14 days and are up almost 30% since the end of June, although once adjusted for inflation they are only just over half the peak set after the Iranian revolution in 1979. </p> <p>Share prices around the world have been depressed by stronger oil prices because stock markets fear a rise in industry's costs and a drop in consumer demand, although oil company shares have done well. </p> <p>Markets rebounded yesterday when oil prices fell back from their highs. In New York the Dow Jones gained more than 0.5% to 10,028 in mid-day trading while the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 1.5% at 1,821. </p> <p>The surge in oil prices has been driven by the highest demand for the fuel in decades, particularly from the United States and China, at a time when there is little spare production capacity and with output in Iraq stunted by fighting. </p> <p>Markets had been lifted on Tuesday by benign US inflation figures which showed the oil price spike had not yet pushed up inflation. </p> <p>Yesterday German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der tried to play down fears that dearer energy would tip the world into a recession. </p> <p>\"We don't see any negative impact from the oil price and we still have very robust global growth,\" he said. </p> <p>Oil producers' cartel Opec said in a report that it was pumping about 30m barrels a day, up from 29.5m last month. It also forecasts that production in September could reach 30.5m barrels a day out of a total world output of some 81m. </p> <p>Opec production is at its highest in 25 years but that has not been enough to calm mar kets because demand is so strong. </p> <p>The temporary closure of oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Charley has also been blamed for adding to the current high prices. </p> <p>Oil and minerals group BHP Billiton set aside normal oil company restraint in predicting the future direction of crude, saying prices could soon top the $50 a barrel mark. </p> <p>But it dismissed as ridiculous suggestions that oil companies had deliberately reduced spending on exploration and production in order to keep global oil prices high. </p> <p>\"It's opportunity constraint that is the problem rather than a sinister plot,\" said the group's oil boss, Phil Aiken.</p>",
  "It was characteristic of Nick Pretzlik that his death from heart failure, at the age of 58, should have occurred during a hectic training schedule - sometimes cycling up to 70 miles a day - in preparation for a charity London-Jerusalem peace cycle ride. Pretzlik was a son of the establishment who renounced his business career and won international praise for his work for ordinary Palestinians under Israeli occupation. <p>Pretzlik's commitment to the Palestinian cause was prompted by the time his eldest son spent in Israel-Palestine in 1989, working with the Bedouin during the first intifada. Pretzlik then travelled extensively in the Middle East, especially the Israeli-occupied territories, from where he wrote passionate articles for websites around the world, ranging from the Electronic Intifada to Jews For Justice For Palestinians, as well as publishing outlets in US universities and English-speaking Middle Eastern newspapers. He was praised for his \"courage and commitment\" by the Right Reverend Riah abu El Assal, Anglican bishop in Jerusalem. It was evidence of his charm and energy that he secured an agreement from two Labour members of the Israeli Knesset [parliament] that they would greet the cyclists at the Jordanian border to ease their way into the West Bank through Israeli military security. </p> <p>Pretzlik avoided joining any political organisation, and was above all a believer in reconciliation, who would plead with the Israeli military and security to allow Palestinians to get to a hospital or a school, whether it was in Gaza's Rafah refugee camp or the blitzed cities of Jenin and Nablus. For one 12-year-old Jenin boy with spina bifida, this, and the funds Pretzlik raised, enabled him to receive the treatment that now allows him to walk with crutches. And for a young man from Gaza, this meant the chance to study linguistics at London University. </p> <p>Pretzlik was born in west Sussex to a beautiful and spirited Scots mother, and a father who represented England as an amateur golfer and was a wartime RAF night fighter pilot. He was educated at Ludgrove in Wokingham, Berkshire and then Eton, where he played cricket for the Public Schools at Lord's against the Combined Services, and was English ski-jumping champion at 17. His real love was touring the Alps with skins attached to his skis, usually in pursuit of solitude. Climbing in the Andes and Himalayas, he twice reached 22,000ft. He brought the same optimism and determination to the Arthur Woollacott Group, the paper and packaging business that he ran. But at 49, when work undermined his health, he made a 10,000km journey around South America. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Ursula, his two sons, and his father. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Nicholas Charles Pretzlik, businessman, born July 30 1945; died July 11 2004</p>",
  "One of the most controversial issues of the last Australian elections has returned to haunt the prime minister, John Howard, as support for his coalition slumps in the run-up to federal polls. <p>Mr Howard faces the threat of a second Senate inquiry into claims that he lied to the public over the \"children overboard\" affair. </p> <p>False claims that asylum seekers sailing from Indonesia to northern Australia were throwing children into the sea in their attempts to enter Australia emerged two days after the start of the election campaign, on October 7 2001, based initially on a confused report from a naval officer. </p> <p>A correct account of the encounter between Australian coastguards and the would-be refugees reached the prime minister's office three days later, but Mr Howard continued to back the children overboard story in the month leading up to the November 10 polls. \"In my mind there is no uncertainty because I don't disbelieve the advice I was given by defence,\" he told reporters. </p> <p>Photographs purporting to show coastguards rescuing children who had been thrown off the ship Olong were released by the government on October 10. It later emerged that the pictures showed coastguards rescuing people from the ship after it sank while being towed from Australian waters by the navy. </p> <p>The opposition Senate leader, John Faulkner, yesterday indicated the upper house would investigate claims that civil servants had been gagged during a 2002 Senate inquiry into the episode. A new inquiry would be likely to report shortly before elections expected this October. </p> <p>Mr Howard rejected the plan as politically motivated. \"The Senate is being used by the anti-government parties to score political points against me,\" he told 2UE radio. </p> <p>Fresh attacks on the prime minister's credibility were sparked on Monday after Mike Scrafton, a former bureaucrat in the defence department, claimed to have warned Mr Howard on November 7, on the eve of the leader's speech to the National Press Club, that there was no evidence for the children overboard story. </p> <p>On Tuesday night the former aide passed a lie detector test on TV, and yesterday two other people connected with the episode came forward to challenge the government's version of events. The former defence public affairs chief Jenny McKenry told ABC radio that Mr Scrafton's account matched her conversations with him on the morning of the press club speech. \"He told me that there was no evidence to support the children overboard story, and that is what he had conveyed to the prime minister,\" she said. </p> <p>Laura Whittle, a sailor who appeared in photos of the incident, said the only child she had seen held over the side of the Olong was being helped by the father: \"The man was wanting to get the child into our inflatable boat to safety.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard rejected suggestions that he should also take a lie detector test. \"The Australian people are the great lie detectors of Australian politics,\" he said.</p>",

Perhaps it is because of the ill-informed, irresponsible and even malicious anti-Athens media campaign ... </p> <p>Of the 2.5m tickets sold, 95% were bought by Athenians. Greeks are supporting the games. Unfortunately, foreign visitors have stayed away in droves. Travel warnings and scaremongering in the US, Australian and British media have kept thousands of people away from a safe, vibrant and hospitable European city. <br> Lazarus Lazarakis <b> Age, Australia, August 16</b> </p> <p>In 1991 when the Iraqi Shias rose up against Saddam Hussein we were informed that they were a heroic bunch and Saddam was a tyrant for putting the uprising down.

  "<p>British biologists worry about aggressive space invaders such as Japanese knotweed, the Spanish bluebell and the ruddy duck. But in the long run, is change always for the bad? Before the completion of the Panama canal in 1914, there were two entirely isolated communities of freshwater fish, one in the Rio Chagres on the Caribbean slope, and another in the Rio Grande on the Pacific watershed. And then the flooding of the international waterway that linked two oceans also linked two freshwater communities. Researchers from McGill University in Canada, the Redpath Museum in Montreal, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute looked at data gathered from the two rivers in 1916, and then studied the realities of piscine asylum seekers and economic migrants almost a century later. What they found, they report in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, was that both communities had become richer and more varied, and that there had been no extinctions. </p> <p>This unplanned natural experiment, they think, could help to settle old arguments among ecologists: do local communities become saturated? Does competition mean that the weakest go to the wall? Is there some sort of upper limit to the number of species that can co-exist in an ecological community? </p> <p>They surveyed 15 stretches of each river and its tributaries as they ran through pristine tropical forest during the dry season in 2002. They also examined the Smithsonian tropical freshwater fish database and counted 35 species and 31 genera in the Rio Chagres, and 22 species and 19 genera in the other. \"Our results suggest no species has been locally extirpated as a consequence of the cross-divide movement of freshwater fish through the Panama Canal,\" they say. Instead, species richness increased by 22% on the Caribbean side and 40% on the Pacific slope.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists using satellites have mapped huge craters under the Antarctic ice sheet caused by an asteroid as big as the one believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65m years ago. </p> <p>Professor Frans van der Hoeven, from Delft University in the Netherlands, told the conference that the evidence showed that an asteroid measuring between three and seven miles across had broken up in the atmosphere and five large pieces had hit the Earth, creating multiple craters over an area measuring 1,300 by 2,400 miles. </p> <p>The effect would have been to melt all the ice in the path of the pieces, as well as the crust underneath. The biggest single strike caused a hole in the ice sheet roughly 200 by 200 miles, which would have melted about 1% of the ice sheet, raising water levels worldwide by 60cm (2ft). </p> <p>But the climatic conditions were different at the time of the strike - about 780,000 years ago - from when the asteroid that is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs struck Yucatan in Mexico. </p> <p>That impact created dust storms and fires that, by blocking out the sun, cooled the Earth's atmosphere so much that the dinosaurs could not survive. The Antarctica strike occurred during an ice age, so even tidal waves would have been weakened to mere ripples by the calming effect of icebergs on the ocean. </p> <p>Prof Van der Hoeven first realised that there may have been a giant asteroid strike in the Antarctic while on an expedition across the continent in 1960 when he noticed severe anomalies in the gravity from the rocks below, indicating a crater. By coincidence another scientist had concluded that a giant event must have occurred around 780,000 years ago somewhere in the southern hemisphere, probably Antarctica. </p> <p>But it was not until this year, when two satellites operating above Antarctica began to map the anomalies in the gravity, that the scale of the crater emerged. The mapping showed that the holes in the rock created by the strike had refilled with a mixture of ice, rock and other debris far less dense. This material, called breccia, shows where and how deep the craters are. </p> <p>Prof Van der Hoeven said: \"The extraordinary thing about this meteor strike is that it appeared to do so little damage. Unlike the dinosaur strike there is no telltale layer of dust that demonstrates the history of the event. It may have damaged things and wiped out species but there is no sign of it.\" </p> <p>One thing that did happen at exactly the same time was the reversing of the Earth's magnetic field. There is no other explanation as to why this took place and Prof Van der Hoeven believes it was caused by the impact.</p>",
  "Before attending a rally to hear vice president Dick Cheney, citizens in New Mexico were required to sign a political loyalty oath approved by the Republican national committee. \"I, [full name] ... do herby [sic] endorse George W Bush for reelection of the United States.\" The form noted: \"In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush.\" <p>Bush is campaigning at events billed as Ask President Bush. Only supporters are allowed in. Talking points are distributed to questioners. In Traverse City, Michigan, a 55-year-old social studies teacher who wore a Kerry sticker had her ticket torn up at the door. \"How can anyone in the US deny someone entry?\" she asked. \"Isn't this a democracy?\" </p> <p>At every rally, Bush repeats the same speech, touting a \"vibrant economy\" and his leadership in a war where \"you cannot show weakness\". He introduces local entrepreneurs who praise his tax cuts. (More than one million jobs have been lost in his term.) Then Bush calls on questioners. More than one-fifth of them profess their evangelical faith or denounce gay marriage. In Niceville, Florida, one said: \"This is the very first time that I have felt that God was in the White House.\" \"Thank you,\" replied Bush. Another: \"Mr President, as a child, how can I help you get votes?\" In Albuquerque, he was told: \"It's an honour every day when I get to pray for you as president.\" And this one: \"Thank God we finally have a commander-in-chief.\" Others repeat attack lines on John Kerry's military record to which Bush responds with an oblique but encouraging \"Thanks\". </p> <p>Bush's overriding strategy is to bolster his credentials as a decisive military figure and to impugn his opponent's manhood. In his latest TV commercial, he says: \"We cannot hesitate, we cannot yield, we must do everything in our power to bring an enemy to justice before they hurt us again.\" But, according to the Washington Post, for the last two years he has uttered the elusive Osama bin Laden's name only 10 times, and \"on six of those occasions it was because he was asked a direct question ... Not once during that period has he talked about Bin Laden at any length, or said anything substantive\". At Ask President Bush events, he mentions 9/11 only to raise the threat of Saddam. </p> <p>Vice president Cheney sneered at Kerry for even using the word \"sensitive\" with respect to counter-terrorism. Not one war was \"won by being sensitive\", mocked Cheney. Kerry, in fact, had called for fighting \"a more effective, more thoughtful, more strategic, more proactive, more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side and lives up to American values in history\". Cheney's distortion is calculated to attempt to portray Kerry as somehow effeminate. </p> <p>At the same time, a Republican front group of Vietnam veterans financed by a major Bush contributor is running an ad campaign claiming Kerry's account of his military record is false. But not one of these veterans served with him on his boat. </p> <p>During the Vietnam war, Bush famously used his father's connections to get a posting as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard because it was filled with the sons of privilege. After refusing to submit to a routine drug test, he was suspended and never flew again. He got himself transferred to the Alabama National Guard, but didn't turn up for his tour of duty. Since then, he has withheld his full military records. Now he encourages smears that a genuine war hero has lied about his service and is a coward. But this is more than a case of projection. The more profound issue is not who served in Vietnam and who dodged. It is whether the president is a sovereign. </p> <p>Since the birth of the US party system, presidential candidates have gone directly to the sovereign people to make their case. After the Democratic convention, Kerry travelled from New England to the northwest doing just that. Not one of the hundreds of thousands who attended his open-air rallies had to pledge allegiance to him, and he encountered organised Bush hecklers as part of the price. At his rallies Bush is a pseudo-populist. But these controlled environments reflect his deeper view of the presidency as sovereign, preempting democracy. </p> <p>Floundering in the polls, without a strategy for Iraq, unwilling to say the name of Bin Laden, he is secure in the knowledge that the cheering multitudes have been selected. Ask President Bush has crystallised the underlying issue, framed succinctly by the greatest American poet of democracy, Walt Whitman, who wrote: \"The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you who are here for him.\" </p> <p> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Taking care of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally is vital if you want to make the most of your time at university. It might sound appealing to spend your student days eating exactly what you like, having random sex with everyone in your corridor and drinking so much that you begin to resemble a pickled egg, but the novelty soon wears off. A certain amount of overindulgence is inevitable (and actually quite fun), but taking a few simple steps to safeguard your health will help to ensure that the coming years pass smoothly and safely.</p> <p>It's a good idea to take a basic first-aid kit with you, containing extra supplies of painkillers and antacids. Condoms and multivitamins will come in useful, as will bumper packets of tea bags and instant coffee. A few carefully chosen books and photos of your friends and family will help to keep you sane at times of stress.</p> <p>If you have time, do some basic research into health and welfare provision at your university; an afternoon on the internet now will save you a lot of time and hassle later. One of the most informative websites is <a href=\"http://www.studenthealth.co.uk\"> www.studenthealth.co.uk</a>, which offers advice on a wide range of relevant issues.</p> <p>Once you arrive, your students' union welfare officer or student support officer and university welfare staff will be on hand to explain the set-up and answer any queries. Most universities organise mentoring schemes, aimed at ensuring that you don't spend the entire week hiding in your room.</p> <p>At the University of Wales, Newport, current students act as Stars (student team accommodation representatives), offering support and guidance to new arrivals. Kingston University students' union operates a similar system, known as \"Freshers' Angels\". At most Oxbridge colleges, freshers are allocated college \"parents\" to ensure they settle in as quickly as possible. Rest assured that these people will be friendly and welcoming: it's their job.</p> <p>It is essential to register with a GP as soon as possible. Most universities or colleges have their own health centres or will recommend a student-friendly surgery nearby, but you can register somewhere else if you wish. At some intercollegiate halls in London, students are only issued with hall passes after registering with a GP. (This could mean you go without your dinner for several days, depending on how organised you are.) Your GP can be a great source of support, and there is usually a friendly nurse available to hand out free condoms and offer confidential advice on everything from herpes to homesickness.</p> <p>Students are particularly vulnerable to meningitis, mainly due to all the snogging and communal living in halls of residence. There is an effective vaccine against one of the main strains of bacterial meningitis (C); have it before you arrive if possible, as new students are most at risk. Many universities have launched campaigns to reduce the incidence of meningitis, and you may receive a letter informing you about the early signs of the illness and the importance of receiving the vaccine.</p> <p>Once you've met your neighbours, unpacked those tea bags and located a good doctor, all that remains is to keep yourself healthy and happy. Don't worry if you feel lonely or unsure of yourself in the first weeks of term - it's entirely normal.</p> <p>You'll experience huge highs and lows at university, so be kind to yourself. Eating and drinking sensibly is vital if you plan to stay on top of things. It is perfectly possible to survive on a diet of Pro Plus, Red Bull, Pot Noodles and nothing else, at least for a while. But, although it might sound dull, a balanced diet, moderate exercise and two litres of water a day will make you feel permanently energised and ready to face another hectic round of socialising, studying and partying.</p> <p>Drinking heavily is bound to leave you feeling tired and irritable. Let's be realistic about it: unless you're teetotal in the first place, there's no point trying to abstain from alcohol during freshers' week. Booze is on tap at every social event. It breaks the ice and offers welcome relief from those fraught conversations about whether you went to Thailand in your gap year, but it's tough on your liver.</p> <p>The safe daily limits for alcohol consumption are two to three units for women and three to four units for men. One unit is equivalent to a small glass of wine, half a pint of lager or a pub-standard gin and tonic. Binge drinking should be avoided, but if you do end up on the tequila slammers in week one, take these simple steps: drink lots of water before you go to bed, have a good fry-up the next day, and don't head straight back to the pub. And remember, your body will need a couple of alcohol-free days to recover.</p> <p>Many young people start smoking at university, which is something they often regret (take it from one who knows). If you smoke already, freshers' week is not the time to give up; if you don't smoke, do yourself a favour and don't start.</p> <p>As for heavier drugs, it might be tempting to use your new-found freedom to experiment with every illegal and mind-bending substance under the sun, but it's hard to study when your brain feels like mush, and it won't do much for your ability to make friends if you're so lethargic you can't get out of bed. That said, plenty of students smoke grass from time to time and very few become addicted to heroin. As with everything else, it's your responsibility to know where to draw the line.</p> <p>Over-consumption of alcohol or drugs won't just leave you feeling blue in the morning: it removes your inhibitions, increasing the chances that you'll end up shagging your less-than-attractive neighbour after a particularly hectic night in the bar. And then you remember, through the haze, that you forgot to pack the condoms, and so did s/he, and before you know it you're sitting in the genito-urinary clinic in the third week of term, wondering where it all went wrong.</p> <p>Quite apart from the emotional damage that one-night stands can cause, unprotected sex exposes you to the risk of unwanted pregnancy and a wide range of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). According to the Health Protection Agency, Britain's teenagers suffer from poor sexual health, with a high level of STDs and teenage pregnancies. New cases of infections recorded at genito-urinary clinics doubled between 1991 and 2001, and are still on the increase. Young people, especially women under the age of 20, are the most affected.</p> <p>Most infections are treatable with antibiotics, but you need to seek help if you've put yourself at risk. If left untreated, chlamydia and gonorrhoea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women; the virus that causes genital warts is linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer. Confidential advice is available from your local GP surgery or genito-urinary clinic; you can also pick up enough free condoms to last a lifetime. If the pressure of staying out of trouble gets too much, panic not. However big or small the problem, there is no shame in admitting that you're finding it tough to cope. As soon as you talk to someone, things will seem more manageable. A veritable army of professionals is available to offer help and support, ranging from university and students' union welfare officers to trained nurses and counsellors.</p> <p>If you have issues with depression, anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders or anything else that could cause you problems, it is essential to seek help sooner rather than later. You will be away from your family and oldest friends, and need to create a good support network in your new environment. Make an appointment to see your GP, who can discuss self-help techniques and/or suitable medication with you, and make a referral to a counsellor, psychologist or psychiatrist if necessary.</p> <p>University counselling services are usually of a high standard and free of charge. Many students' union welfare offices organise weekly drop-in clinics. Helplines run by students, for students, can be useful for discussing relationship issues or exam stress, and the Samaritans are always available to lend a sympathetic ear.</p> <p>A final word of advice, and one that worked for me: take some regular time out on your own. Going for a walk, reading the Sunday papers or watching a good film can work wonders to calm you down and help you to gain some valuable perspective. Who knows, with a clear head you might even feel like writing an essay or going to a couple of lectures.

  "<p>Hey, good cooking!</p> <p>Fiona Beckett feeds you some ideas for nutritious meals</p> <p>I may be doing you a monstrous injustice, but I guess the last thing you'll have on your mind as you head off to university is how you're going to feed yourself. But it will be, by contrast, the anxiety uppermost in your mother's.</p> <p>The urban myth is that no one cooks these days, so you may just assume you can live off ready meals and takeaways. But unless you frequently prowl the aisles of your local supermarket, you may not be aware that many ready meals now cost well over \u00a33, which won't make the average \u00a34.14 a day you have to spend on food, according to one recent survey, go very far. So there are some good reasons to spend the next few weeks acquiring some basic cooking skills:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You save money. A pre-packed salad, for example, costs about three times as much as a basic lettuce. A home-made pasta sauce is less than half the price of one in a jar.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You eat better. Cheap convenience food tastes crap.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You increase your chances of pulling. Partly because being able to cook is seductive. Partly because if you eat healthily you won't be fat and spotty.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You'll never be short of a friend. Look at all the mates Jamie Oliver continually has round. The downside is that they may constantly be on the scrounge, expecting you to feed them for free. Extort money up front.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You won't constantly be throwing a sickie. Admittedly, this can be useful as an excuse for a missed essay deadline, but it's not much fun snuffling away all winter while everyone else is out having fun. Good food builds up your resistance to infection.</p> <p>So where do you start? Well, what do you like? Hopefully you can at least make yourself a fry-up, a sandwich and heat through a pizza, but if you can't make a simple pasta dish by now it's time you gave it a go. Acquiring a wok makes a lot of sense, especially if you're a veggie, not only for stir-fries but all-in-one rice and noodle dishes and even big, chunky soups. Master a couple of recipes so you can do them almost without thinking, so that every meal doesn't seem like a massive struggle.</p> <p>Take a trip to a street market for inspiration. Now we can buy ingredients such as strawberries all year round, it's easy to lose touch with what's in season (and therefore cheap). Spring onions, for example, can cost as much as 85p a bunch in the winter. At this time of year, they're half the price. The quality of seasonal food is better, too.</p> <p>It's more fun to cook with someone. Get together with friends and make a slap-up meal (I have a monthly \"feast\" on my website <a href=\"http://www.beyondbakedbeans.com\"> www.beyondbakedbeans.com</a>). Or have a baking session. Choc-chip cookies fresh from the oven are an indulgence anyone can afford.</p> <p>Ingredients such as freshly squeezed lemon juice, garlic, fresh parsley and coriander will transform even the most turgid meal. And try the Thai-style sweet chilli sauce you can buy in Asian supermarkets instead of ketchup.</p> <p>Above all, don't succumb to the idea that cooking is a drag. It needn't be and it's not rocket science. If you can pass your A-levels, you can read a recipe.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fiona Beckett is the author of two student cookbooks, Beyond Baked Beans and Beyond Baked Beans Green. Both are available from Absolute Press at \u00a38.99</p> <p><strong>Quick and easy recipes</strong></p> <p><strong>Easiest ever pasta sauce</strong></p> <p>Once you've made this - which should cost you less than 50p - you'll wonder why anyone uses a ready-made tomato sauce. It makes enough for two meals, which you can vary with additions such as tuna and olives, red pepper and chilli, or use as a base for a bolognese. Don't bother with chopped tomatoes; just simple whole tomatoes will do. Enough for 2-4 portions, depending on what else you add.</p> <p>2 tbsp olive oil<br> 1 clove of garlic, peeled and crushed<br> 1 400g tin of whole tomatoes<br> Salt, pepper and sugar to taste</p> <p>Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the garlic. Tip in the tin of tomatoes and crush with a fork or a wooden spoon. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar and simmer for about 10 minutes till thick and jammy. That's it, basically. I would add a couple of spoonfuls of chopped fresh parsley and some freshly grated parmesan to serve, but grated cheddar will do fine.</p> <p><strong>Mixed bean and crumbly white cheese salad</strong></p> <p>An easy salad that makes a substantial meal. Use a regional English cheese like Caerphilly or Wensleydale rather than expensive feta. Serves 2.</p> <p>400g can of mixed beans<br> 2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped or 2 heaped tbsp finely chopped onion<br> 100g Caerphilly, white Cheshire or Wensleydale cheese<br> 1 portion Italian style oil, lemon and parsley dressing (see below) <br> Extra chopped parsley to serve</p> <p>Tip the beans into a sieve or colander and rinse well under the cold tap. Shake off the excess water and put in a bowl. Trim and finely slice the onions, cut the cheese up into small cubes and add to the salad. Pour the dressing over the salad, toss everything together and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Good with warm pitta bread.</p> <p><strong>Italian-style oil, lemon and parsley dressing</strong></p> <p>A simple dressing that tastes much, much better than bottled ones. Good with tomatoes, too.</p> <p>1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1/2 clove garlic, crushed (optional) <br> A little sugar, salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 tbsp olive oil<br> 1 tbsp finely chopped parsley</p> <p>Put the lemon juice, garlic and seasoning in a bowl and whisk together with a fork. Gradually add the oil, whisking continually, and stir in the parsley. Add a little more lemon juice if you think it needs it.</p> <p><strong>Sugared plum toasts</strong></p> <p>Just to underline that cooking doesn't always have to be boringly virtuous. And it contributes towards your five recommended fruit and veg a day. Serves 1.</p> <p>2 plums<br> Small slice butter (about 15g)<br> 1 dessertspoon caster sugar<br> 1/4 tsp cinnamon (optional, but good)<br> 2 thick slices of malt loaf</p> <p>Stone the plums by cutting round the stone and twisting the two halves of the fruit in opposite directions (if the plums are not very ripe that may not work; you may just have to hack away the fruit from the stone). Slice or chop into chunks. Heat a small frying pan, add the butter, then when the sizzling dies down, chuck in the plums. Stir-fry them for about a minute and a half, then sprinkle over the sugar and cinnamon, if using, and fry for another minute. Toast the bread and pile the plums on top of the two slices. Top with a dollop of plain yoghurt if you have some - or, even better, some vanilla ice cream.</p>",
  "This has been a summer of reflection. Before the August break, I had been involved in a furious argument - well, several - about the Dear Leader. On these pages I'd argued it was time for Tony Blair to bow out. Good friends were appalled. Excellent ministers, who have helped improve this country greatly over the past seven years, let me have it with both barrels. Others phoned up with pained advice to think again. Don't let the frenzied silliness of July at Westminster get to you, they said. <p>So I have been rethinking. No one seriously interested in the centre-left can be immune to the pro-Blair case, from two landslide election victories to the subsequent successes in the fight against child poverty, the minimum wage, and the utter baffling of that once-mighty force, Tory Britain. Nor can we lightly dismiss those twin ancient sins of the left, oppositionism and division. </p> <p>Oppositionism, that rancid loathing for every aspect of power, even Labour power, is an ugly creature: this remains a government full of decent people doing their best. Their motives are good. Many of their achievements are real. Division has scarred the left throughout its history and kept it well away from power. I'm not even entirely immune from the personal Blair case. He remains a charming, impeccably polite, good-natured and amazingly resilient man. </p> <p>Armed with these thoughts and a heavy bag's worth of political reading, the summer crop of Blair biographies, books about Blair's war, Blair's spin doctor, Blair's friend George W, I've been reconsidering. We are not so far from a general election; I have no desire to do the Tories' work for them. Isn't it time to forget the doubts and get behind Tony? </p> <p>Here are a few thoughts it's hard to argue against. First, we are not looking over the precipice to a Tory victory. After the early euphoria of Michael Howard's Commons performances, the Conservatives have failed to move in the polls or to break through in real elections, and are now slumped in listless fatalism. The only time you can get Tories to show real enthusiasm is when they are discussing the leadership battle after the election. Campaign teams are already being put in place. </p> <p>Second, the Labour movement is not a leadership cult. There is a big difference between criticising the current prime minister and leftist factionalism of the old sort. The days of Trots taking over constituency Labour parties did Labour no good. But to pretend that criticising Blair is somehow equivalent strikes me as barmy. Labour needs its free speech, its outspokenness, its arguments, or it isn't a living party at all, merely an electoral machine, oiled with the baubles of office. </p> <p>Third, while it is true that these two New Labour governments have achieved a great deal, a high proportion of that achievement has not come from the prime minister. The remaking of monetary policy; the minimum wage; extra help for poorer working families; the tax rises to pay for a big increase in health spending; devolution for Scotland and Wales; the blitz on unemployment and the concentration on child poverty all originated with the Treasury team, or crusading departmental ministers, or were inherited from John Smith. </p> <p>In traditional parliamentary politics, this would have been unsurprising. It's actually healthy. It's just that we have evolved such a grotesquely leader-focused political culture - one whipped up by the Alastair Campbells of this world - that the discrepancy between the government's domestic achievements (great) and the personal achievements of the prime minister (dubious) seems embarrassing. In other words, to criticise Blair is not to criticise \"his\" government. </p> <p>Blair has his No 10 graph-drawers such as Sir Michael Barber. He is no doubt keen to keep on top of what is happening, from crime to asylum, from the economy to statistics on cancer survival. And he shows an impressive grasp of the numbers. But the ideas came from elsewhere and so does much of the energy. In recent years No 10 has lost its thinkers and its Labour progressives, and has not recruited any more. </p> <p>Instead it has reshaped itself around the prime minister's interests and instincts which are, for the most part, looking towards the world stage. His greatest domestic achievement, in the sense of a policy breakthrough that was down to his own attention and obsessive working, was the Northern Ireland peace process. Following on from that, he has pursued diplomacy and deal-brokering everywhere from the Balkans to Brussels, Washington to Baghdad. It is one of the things he is very good at. </p> <p>Which leads me to the reason I found myself arguing so furiously against him to start with. He has enthusiastically aligned himself with every rightwing force he can find in the world. George Bush is not just a Republican president, but the representative of a tight cluster of big-oil, anti-environmental, tax-cuts-for-the-rich politicians and tycoons. They have shown contempt for Europe, and for global institutions, and seem to see the world as a playground for the projection of America's awesome force. </p> <p>In the Middle East the Iraq war has not produced either stability or democracy. Iraq itself remains a bloodbath. Saudi Arabia is more volatile than ever, and in Israel, Ariel Sharon has just again shown his contempt for the road map. Terrorism is being desperately contained, so far, by western security services but, as Islamic disaffection spreads, only just. </p> <p>Washington's allies are now a strange group of rightwing European leaders, and Blair follows suit. Here's a thought experiment: imagine him taking a holiday with Jacques Chirac. Impossible, isn't it? Blair has isolated himself, not simply on the Sardinian coast with the odious Silvio Berlusconi, but from the European mainstream. </p> <p>Even those loyalists who argue for a \"better Blair\" must have had their optimism shaken by this summer's events: the appointment of Labour's least-favourite politician, Peter Mandelson, to a plum job, followed by those pictures of the Blairs cavorting with Berlusconi. We are, it appears, getting an even worse Blair than before, who delights in deriding his party. </p> <p>Moreover, this Blair is not, despite what his people tell you, the only Labour man who can win an election. Poll after poll has shown that Gordon Brown would win a bigger majority than Blair. </p> <p>Here is the truth I cannot get away from. Blair isn't one of ours. His career as a Labour prime minister has been an exhilarating, infuriating, sometimes hilarious accident. He belongs with them, the people he wants to belong with - the rightwing politicians, the Republican proconsuls, the Italian aristocrats, the global media tycoons. He is at least honest enough to make no pretence about it. As the Irish say, fair play to him. But the result of my rethinking? My good, loyal, hard-working Labour friends - you should reflect a bit yourselves. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "I come from a family of secrets and lies, and as a consequence have led a life of deception and cover-up. It took a couple of decades for me to understand this, that what was being acted out in my conscious life was a secret to which I didn't have access. I knew I had had a god-awful childhood, but I also knew there were things I couldn't remember about it, and everything I knew about psychology told me we don't have amnesia about the happy parts. As the years passed and my life kept crashing, I decided that the memories I had forgotten would have to be brought back. By then I had knocked out nine novels in 12 years; as soon as I finished one I started another. I was in that sense a junkie, and the only way of knowing what lay behind all the violence and murder I wrote about was to go cold turkey. I stopped writing completely. <p>In 1990, at a writers' conference in Toronto, I had my first hallucination: the high-heeled shoes I was wearing turned into a pair of black button-up shoes, the kind a little girl would wear. It was a freaky moment, lasting only a few seconds, but enough to take me back to a time in my life when I had worn shoes like that. I was six. I knew exactly where I had been. Following these clues like a map, I entered a year of madness and grief when fragments of memories slowly culminated into one piercingly clear memory of my father raping me. People sometimes ask: How could you forget something like that? The real question is: how could you remember? If you did, how could you sit opposite your dad in the morning without sticking a knife into him? How could you open your mouth without blurting it all out? The first time it happened, I told my mother. She said I was lying and warned me never to mention it again. The rapes continued until I was 12 and went to boarding school in Johannesburg. No one in our family was saying a word. It would take decades before I could. </p> <p>After I stopped writing, I didn't go back to it for over seven years. When I did, I knew I would have to write about my childhood - not the one I had described in my fourth novel, Dreams of the Kalahari, but the hidden part. No publisher would touch it. They were nervous, but then so was I. I wasn't prepared to put myself on the line; I had written my story as a novel and, to give it even more distance, I had set it in America rather than in Africa, where I grew up. When the book was rejected on both sides of the Atlantic, I wrote a second version. This novel was rejected, too. Finally, I wrote the story as it had happened, in Africa, at a time when British colonial rule was coming to an end. This time the publishers were ecstatic. My memoir Before the Knife was published two years ago, and the door to the past began to swing shut. </p> <p>The second secret in our household centred on my maternal grandmother, Anne, who left Wales when she went to India to marry my grandfather. My mother - like my grandfather, my sister and I - was born in India, but she never talked about her childhood and it was many years before I even realised she had lived there. I was told that that my grandmother had died when my mother was nine, nothing more. I was one of those kids who kept asking questions: what did my grandmother die of, what was she like, could I see a picture? But no one was talking. </p> <p>When my mother began to descend into Alzheimer's after a lifetime of depression, I wrote to her brother, Ivan, and asked him to tell me everything he could remember about their mother. I said I wanted to write a book about her. (This was a lie.) He wrote back: \"Keep calm for a minute before reading further. Please. Your grandmother, my own mother, is alive, she is 81 years old, is physically fit, very active, and does sewing at the time this letter is being written.\" He continued: \"Dear Carolyn, I am sorry these things are coming to light for you, but you asked for knowledge and when the Rock of Truth is lifted, God's truth will be revealed.\" Finally, several letters later, he told me my grandmother was in a mental institution. </p> <p>In these conversations with my mother's brother, and in the deluge of his strange, frantic letters, full of religiosity and despair, written late at night in a caravan in Okehampton, Devon, I got to know my grandmother and my mother for the first time. The lie I had told about writing a book about her was no longer a lie. When I first decided to write a novel about Anne Webb, there wasn't much to go on - just the little my uncle could remember. I knew that she was born on March 26 1897 and grew up in Porthcawl, in the Vale of Glamorgan, and that it was there she met her future husband. He was on leave from the Indian army and looking for a wife. Anne was strenuously urged not to marry him; her family didn't like or trust him. But they sailed off to India and set up home in Ferozepore in Punjab, where my mother and her two brothers were born. Anne was left alone for long periods of time while her sergeant husband was up in the hills, fighting imperial battles. </p> <p>My grandfather had had a miserable childhood; he was an army brat, born and raised in barracks and then sent to the strict military school where he later sent his own children, the Lawrence military asylum for the children of British soldiers serving in India. My uncle has described his time there as a \"condition of orphans, only worse\"; they were small children living under a disciplinarian regime in a remote part of the Himalayas. </p> <p>At some point in their marriage, Neville took Anne back to Wales and tried to leave her there; it seems she might have had a nervous breakdown in India. But she got a job, saved money by living on \"bread and scrape\" and bought her passage back to India. She wanted to see her children, who by now had been at military school for five years. Not long after, in 1936, my grandfather arranged to have her put away - it only took a doctor's signature - and she was taken to a mental institution in Ranchi, Bihar. My uncle described it as \"the lunatic asylum of the British Raj, notorious from the time of the Indian mutiny\". </p> <p>Neville was taken prisoner by the Japanese in l941, at the surrender of Singapore. He was presumed dead at the time of my parents' marriage in l943, but my uncle later got a Red Cross postcard telling him his father was alive; he eventually returned to India. He divorced Anne in her absence and remarried, returning to England with his new wife. After independence in 1947, the asylum at Ranchi became a frightening place, according to my uncle, taking in criminals and prostitutes as well as the insane. My mother's two brothers were determined to get their mother released. My mother refused to help them: she was in Africa with us, trying to deal with what was going on under her own roof. In the end, the British government transferred my grandmother back to England in1951, where she was placed in another asylum. </p> <p>When I first went to see her, at St Bernard's in Ealing, I was terrified. I didn't know what I would find and I had images of a woman sitting in a circle with other blank faces, or mumbling to herself in a corner, or shouting obscenities into the air. I hate those places, mainly because I always thought I would end up in one. When I got there I marched right up to the doctor and asked for a diagnosis. I was told there was nothing wrong with her. A nurse said she had once been a little paranoid, nothing more. But while she was sane, she had become institutionalised after spending more than 40 years living in asylums. She could remember the distant past, but little that had happened since her arrival at Ranchi in the 30s. She stayed at St Bernard's until she died in 1985. </p> <p>It's now over 20 years since my uncle and I began our correspondence about his mother. I have used his letters and our conversations as the basis for my novel, but since he was a small boy when his mother was locked up, he didn't remember too much about her. I prefer it that way. It has allowed me to give her a brand- new life and to imagine a different destiny for her. In writing about her, there was one thing I was damn certain of: she wasn't going to be put in the asylum, not for the third time, not by me.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A Black Englishman by Carolyn Slaughter is published by Faber at \u00a310.99.

  "<p>The answer is: you don't. You get out of the way. Flash floods are an accident of timing and topography. An inch of rain over one square mile adds up to 15m gallons of water, for those comfortable with old imperial measures: if the rain falls all at once and if this square mile tips straight into a narrow valley then nothing much is going to stop the cascade. </p> <p>In Britain, flash floods such as the one which devastated Boscastle in Cornwall this week usually cause only limited local embarrassment. In parts of the US, they are a permanent hazard. In June 1972, a thunderstorm in South Dakota led to a flash flood along Rapid Creek which killed 237 people. Even seemingly shallow flash floods are serious threats. Just a foot of water flowing sideways across a road can sweep an automobile off the tarmac and into a ditch. </p> <p>Most flash floods are caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, or more occasionally heavy rains that follow hurricanes. A team at the University of Pittsburgh looked at thunderstorm-related deaths in the US between 1994 and 2000. Altogether, 1,442 people died. More than two-thirds of these were males, swept away by flash floods or struck by lightning. Most of those who died in flash floods were drivers; most of those electrocuted were playing sport. Flash floods tend to happen in arid, rock-strewn hilly regions off which water will flow at speed, after either an intense flow of rain or the breakup of an ice or debris jam. </p> <p>The word \"flash\" is not hyperbole: wadis and dried up riverbeds become foaming torrents within minutes. Urban areas are increasingly at risk of local flash floods, simply because water cannot soak into tarmac or concrete. It runs off city streets two to six times faster than grassland or scrub. In towns and cities, basements and viaducts can become death traps. The felling of forests, too, clears the way for sudden flooding. Just six inches of swiftly moving water can knock people off their feet. Flood waters can tear out great trees as if they were saplings, obliterate sturdy buildings and destroy bridges. Walls of water metres high can carry a lethal cargo of debris. If there is higher ground, head for it: on July 31, 1976, the Big Thompson river near Denver overflowed after a heavy storm. A wall of water six metres high roared down the Big Thompson Canyon. Holidaymakers were camping there at the time. Altogether 140 died in one night.</p>",
  "<p>It's one way to win over an Edinburgh crowd: hand out ice halfway through your show. Aussie comic Sarah Kendall's relationship with the audience (bordering, in the oven that is upstairs at the Pleasance, on bribery) has won her quite a following. She has a proficient line in consensual comedy: when you're introduced to someone, she asks, why does your brain refuse to register their name? </p> <p>Her 2001 show was titled War, and this year's theme is Kendall's awkwardness in social situations. But on neither occasion has she pushed herself far enough into the issue to reap anything other than mild amusement. </p> <p>This 50-minute set recounts several foot-in-mouth moments that Kendall cringes to remember. When she's nervous in public, she says, she instinctively lies: witness the time she claimed to speak Chinese and to have (temporarily) died by drowning. </p> <p>It's entertaining but I'm not sure I believe it. This is partly down to the incongruity between her professed social unease and her profession as a comic. There are passages that hint at how good she could be if she committed herself to acerbic satire (a spoof advert in which women are made to feel ugly by the cosmetics industry), or tosilliness (a mimed harmonica solo).

  "<p>The gap year: a glorious, uninterrupted 365 days for you to do with as you will; a chance to expand your horizons, both mental and physical; an opportunity not to have to sit any blessed exams for once; time for a welcome rest; a breather while you (re)consider your life choices; or just a case of paralysing indecision leading to total inactivity.</p> <p>Whichever way you look at it, a gap year has something to offer pretty much everyone. The only question is: if you take a gap year, what on earth are you going to do with it?</p> <p><strong>Nothing</strong></p> <p>It's always an option: simply take a year off and lie around for the entire time. However, doing nothing is really only a viable option for trainee gurus, who want to spend a year in deep meditation and contemplation, or for the offspring of millionaires whose parents are lenient to the point of insanity. Otherwise, it's a ridiculous plan.</p> <p>You won't have any money, none of your friends will be around, you'll feel as though your life has ground to a halt, and you'll be bored out of your mind. Also, while future employers are fully supportive of a gap year, they would still expect you to do more with your time than just watch Trisha. It's a bad idea. Let's move on.</p> <p><strong>Travel</strong></p> <p>This is more like it. There's many a lonely A-level reviser whose thoughts turn to exotic climes and palm-fringed beaches, and who can blame them? A gap year is the perfect - in fact, possibly the only, ever, in your whole life - chance for an uninterrupted year of travel. And, no, it's not just dossing about somewhere warm.</p> <p>\"Travelling really matures you,\" says Tim Lloyd, who travelled around south-east Asia and Australia in his gap year, before starting his degree in travel management at Brighton University. \"You really have to learn how to deal with people and learn to accept them as they are.\"</p> <p>Lloyd worked at the Royal Mail sorting office in order to finance his trip. \"I resigned myself to not having a life for a few months. I didn't go out, I didn't spend any money, I just worked loads of shifts to save up. I didn't mind because I knew there was such a big life experience at the end of the tunnel.\"</p> <p>One of the main appeals of travelling was the lack of constraints. \"I've always been quite independent,\" he says. \"I didn't want to be tied down to anything. I'd booked my ticket but that was it - and I ended up changing my itinerary a few times, too.\" Which isn't to say travel doesn't have its scary moments.</p> <p>\"I landed in Singapore on my own, age 18, with nowhere to stay. It's quite terrifying thinking back, but you deal with it.\" And, paradoxically, you need to be organised in order to be spontaneous. \"I thoroughly investigated the countries I wanted to go to and had all my jabs. You just have to be clued-up so you can enjoy yourself.\"</p> <p><strong>Work here</strong></p> <p>If, on the other hand, you have no urgent desire to leave the country, why not just get a job? You'll be more flush than you've ever felt before and could save up enough to significantly smooth your transition to student life in a year's time. And it could lead you in undreamt-of directions.</p> <p>That's what happened to Geoffrey Wells, who is studying nursing at Kingston University. \"After my A-levels I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was sick of academic work and I decided to take a gap year. I wasn't even sure that I'd go to college at the end of it. My only motivation at that time was to get some money for a car, and through I neighbour I found out about a job in a care home. I had an informal interview and started working in a day centre for elderly people with dementia or Alzheimer's.\"</p> <p>He found he liked the work. \"It was challenging because most of them were at the stage where they knew something was wrong with them, but couldn't quite work out what.\" Soon, he started considering nursing as a career. \"I decided I wanted a qualification of some sort. My mum's a nurse and she suggested it, as what I was doing was already a form of nursing.\"</p> <p>Wells believes his gap year was valuable. \"It gave me a break and time to think,\" he says. \"If I'd rushed on to college I might have ended up doing something I didn't want to do. I carried on working at the day centre while I was studying, so it's been really useful financially, as well as in terms of experience that I can apply to my nursing.\"</p> <p><strong>Work abroad</strong></p> <p>Finding employment in another country is a good way to travel without parting with too much cash (just don't expect to bring any extra home with you). Because of different visa restrictions around the world, you can't just turn up in the country of your choice and get a job; research is vital. There are also agencies that will help you.</p> <p>Harriet Griffiths has just graduated from Warwick University with a degree in maths. Before she started, she spent a year working in Canada, which she arranged through Bunac. \"I could not have done it without them,\" she says. \"You need a sponsor in order to get a visa, so they do that. They don't find you a job, but they give lots of job-seeking support. And they sort out things like a social security number and a bank account - things you don't really think about before you arrive.\"</p> <p>Because she's a keen skier, Griffiths headed to Banff, in the Rockies, at the start of the ski season. She found work in a hotel. \"Making beds and cleaning toilets wasn't the best job in the world but everyone working in the hotel was there for the same reasons as me, so we had a really good time. The hotel provided cheap accommodation for us, too, so it was a bit like living in student halls, only without the lectures.\"</p> <p>Having to work did not spoil her year out - \"because the rest of the time I was having fun. I was skiing two or three times a week, and it has a real small-town atmosphere, so I could always find someone to go out with. Being in one place for so long meant I got to know it inside out.\"</p> <p>But, she adds, a year out does have some disadvantages. \"You do have to work hard in your first term at college to pick up your subject again and get back into working,\" she says. \"But the benefits far outweigh the problems. I'm more confident in myself. It seems like some people who don't take a gap year go into that machine of school, university, work. I feel like I've seen a bit of the world and it's given me a better outlook on it.\"</p> <p><strong>Volunteer</strong></p> <p>If you're of an altruistic frame of mind, you could consider volunteering, either here or abroad. Charlotte Nock, who is about to start a degree in law with French law at the University of Kent, spent four months in the south Pacific country of Vanuatu - \"50 different islands, near Fiji\" - working in a school, as part of a project organised by GAP.</p> <p>\"It was definitely the place that appealed to me,\" she says. \"It was the other side of the world ... It was different in every way: the people, environment, the landscape. And it was totally idyllic: I lived a few metres away from the bay, and I swam with turtles every day.\" The work was also enjoyable. \"I taught English, French, social science and RE. It was a challenge, especially the RE because it's a country with very strong religious beliefs. I started to really love it. The children responded in a fantastic way and I developed great friendships based round the school.\"</p> <p>Living in a small community with barely any other westerners didn't faze her. \"I totally integrated and I surprised myself by not getting homesick really, apart from a couple of days when I was ill. I do think you need a certain kind of personality to adapt to it. You need to be willing to fit in.\"</p> <p><strong>The unexpected gap year</strong></p> <p>It's all very well if you've been planning your gap year for months, and have read every guide book, scoured every website and digested every scrap of advice you can lay your hands on. But what if your gap year is more thrust upon you than chosen, as a result of disappointing A-level results, perhaps, or a sudden change of heart about your chosen course or college?</p> <p>Remember, you don't have to take a gap year; Clearing is there to smooth your transition into an immediate university career, should you so desire. However, you may decide that some time out is what you need, especially if you're feeling academically shaken.</p> <p>One way to spend your year is to do resits, if you think you need to, or dedicate yourself to reapplying to universities you think will really suit you. On the other hand, perhaps you just want to get the hell out of town. Is it too late? Not remotely.</p> <p>To travel, all you need is a ticket.</p> <p>To work or volunteer abroad, there are literally hundreds of organisations with a myriad options for you to choose from. Don't be rash; give yourself a few months to sort out necessary funds, medical details and insurance and then off you go.</p> <p>See you next year.</p>",
  "<p>It's a hard life for the acacia tree: caterpillars like to munch on the succulent leaves, other trees grow faster and block out the light and, to top it off, vicious, stinging ants often decide to take up residence inside the thorns. Ecologists used to wonder how this poor little tree survived, but now it turns out that some species of acacia have reached a clever agreement with a particularly aggressive type of ant. </p> <p>Nigel Raine, from Queen Mary, University of London, and colleagues from Edinburgh University and St Andrews University, have been studying the relationship between the Acacia hindsii (found in Mexico) and a hostile ant, the Pseudomyrmex veneficus, that the tree employs as its bodyguard. Any unwelcome visitors to the tree are swiftly attacked by the ants, which will also snip off any seedlings within a certain radius, giving the tree extra space to grow. </p> <p>In return for fending off destructive insects and preventing other trees from growing too close, the ants are given somewhere to live and plenty of food. </p> <p>\"The ants bite into the young thorns on the tree, pull out the tissue and wait for the hollowed out thorn to harden and turn into a secure and watertight home,\" says Raine. \"The tree produces sugar-rich nectar, which the ants sup from a little cup-shaped area on the leaf. They also harvest a substance called Beltian, which is full of protein and fat and develops in bright orange bulbs at the tips of the leaves.\" </p> <p>But what happens when the time comes for pollination? Surely these vicious ants will scare away pollinating insects, like bees. For the acacia, these insects are vital; without them they wouldn't be able to produce seeds and create the next generation of acacias. </p> <p>To understand the relationship between ants and acacia trees the scientists took a trip to Mexico and observed the daily activity patterns of ants living on acacia trees. They went during the summer, when the acacias were in flower and the bees were busy pollinating. </p> <p>First they chose four different acacia trees and marked out sections on different areas of each tree. Over a two-day period, and every 90 minutes, they counted the ants on each of the sections. They also recorded the number of bees visiting particular flower patches on each tree and kept an eye on the birds, to see how interested they were in picking up ants for dinner. </p> <p>Many hours of watching and counting revealed that the ants were avoiding going anywhere near the yellow flowers, so allowing the bees to go about their business without having to worry about getting a nasty sting. \"Given that these ants are extremely aggressive and not normally scared of anything, it was puzzling to see them skirting around the flowers,\" says Raine. </p> <p>Were they worried about being too visible to a passing hungry bird, did they find the smell of the flowers repulsive, or was it simply that they had better things to do? </p> <p>If the flowers were emitting a chemical that the ants didn't like, then Raine and his colleagues reasoned that the ants would try to avoid this chemical wherever they found it. To test this idea, they picked some of the flowers (using forceps to avoid contaminating them with human smells) and gently wiped the blooms across flower-free areas of the tree, such as the stems and bark. \"The effect was dramatic,\" explains Raine. \"When an ant reached one of these sections they looked like they had hit a wall, bouncing off and going out of their way to get around the area where the flower had been wiped.\" </p> <p>The scientists also tried wiping the stems and bark with other scents, but it was only the chemicals from the flowers that repulsed the ants. \"It seems that the acacia tree has evolved a mechanism to keep aggressive ants off its flowers during the crucial period when they need to be pollinated,\" says Raine.</p> <p>How this special relationship between ants and acacia trees evolved is still a bit of a mystery, but a new piece of research suggests that the sweetness of the acacia's nectar may form part of the answer. </p> <p>Joshua Ness, from the University of Arizona in Tuscon, has been heading up a team of scientists looking at ants that live on cactus plants in the Sonoran desert of Arizona. </p> <p>They have noticed that the more nectar an ant is fed the hungrier for protein the ants become. This means that plants that produce lots of sweet nectar attract the best bodyguard ants, with the greatest protein cravings and the highest likelihood of gobbling up insects. </p> <p>Certainly, Acacia hindsii provides sweet rewards and has succeeded in attracting one of the most aggressive ants around. However, Acacia hindsii has also gone one step further and developed an ant repellent to ensure that these ants don't interfere with its crucial period of pollination. Evidently there is no need to feel sorry for the acacia; in fact it could probably teach us a lesson or two about how to keep ants out of our homes.</p>"
