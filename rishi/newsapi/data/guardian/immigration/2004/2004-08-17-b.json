  "<p>The British athletics team looks set to return from Athens with, at best, two or three medals. After the highs of four years ago, with Denise Lewis and Jonathan Edwards leading the way, questions are being asked about what has led to this dire state of affairs. </p> <p>But, after this year's top prospects Paula Radcliffe and Kelly Holmes retire, things seem likely to get even worse. </p> <p>Last month, at the World Junior Championships in Grosseto, Italy, our juniors became the first national British team to return from a major championship without a single medal. </p> <p>But with an influx of lottery funding, how can athletics be in such a state? There are several reasons. </p> <p>We are finally seeing the true legacy of Margaret Thatcher's selling-off of school playing fields across the country to property developers, which continues under New Labour. It has left a generation of pupils unaccustomed to competitive sport. </p> <p>Some have blamed lottery funding for the demise, believing that a \"comfort zone\" has been created by the extra cash; Darren Campbell went as far as criticising certain athletes for squandering this money \"on Playstation games and DVDs\". </p> <p>As the older sport-stars approach retirement, the Playstation generation are discovering that they can't cut it in the hotbed of international sport. </p> <p>It is no coincidence that the British athletes expected to win medals in Athens are all in their 30s. </p> <p>Some schools now ban sports days for fear of traumatising those who don't perform well enough, and they deliberately shield children from the spectre of competition early on in life. </p> <p>By doing this, we are sowing the seeds for mediocrity and sporting disaster. Lack of school exercise is the primary reason children are becoming less healthy than their parents and why obesity has become a major issue. </p> <p>One can argue that the same thing is happening in the US, and that they seem to be doing fine at sports. </p> <p>But the American model is very different from ours. Their sport hinges on the collegiate system, where the supremely gifted and talented earn scholarships to the best universities, where they are treated as gods. </p> <p>With my own lottery funding, I relocated to LA for four years and witnessed first-hand just how big and lucrative college sport is. Nothing we have here, not even the Premiership, can compare. </p> <p>The US track and field team, arguably the world's strongest regardless of drugs, is mostly composed of rejects from one of the big four sports: football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey. </p> <p>With a population of almost a third of a billion to choose from, the sporting cream will always rise to the top regardless of the percentage of obese citizens they have. </p> <p>In the UK, athletics is now fighting other sports for the dwindling numbers of youngsters able to compete at a high level. </p> <p>Richard Dawkins of the FA's exercise and physiology department told me that Premiership teams were now going to school sports days and \"poaching\" the best athletes. </p> <p>They believe that it is easier to teach an athlete to play football than it is to teach a footballer to be a prime athlete. </p> <p>With the ridiculous amounts of money paid to footballers, it is not hard to see why a youngster would rather kick a ball around for a living than train three of four times as hard and make a fraction of what a good footballer, cricketer or rugby player earns. </p> <p>The yobbish culture typified by extreme alcoholism, encouraged by some magazines, has contributed to the overall drop in standards. </p> <p>As we come to terms with this, other nations are leap-frogging us. Take a look at today's medal table if you doubt this, and see if you could locate some of the countries ahead of us on a map. </p> <p>Whether this can be rectified is hard to say - it could be argued that we have started on a slippery slope that may only level out decades from now. </p> <p>In 1960, France performed so abysmally at the Rome Olympics that an apoplectic President de Gaulle sacked his heads of sport, allowed colonial subjects to represent France and instigated sporting academies throughout the country. It took 30 years to see the fruits of their labour. </p> <p>In 2001, the Japanese men's gymnastics team was so poor that the country's officials withdrew them from that year's world championships in disgust and set about restructuring the entire set-up. </p> <p>On Monday night, they became the first Japanese men's team to win team gold since 1976 in one of the greatest gymnastics competitions ever. Whether British athletics can get its house in order that quickly is another matter - otherwise, the golden age of British athletics is over. </p> <p>\u00b7 Solomon Wariso is a former 200 and 400 metre athlete who represented Britain at the Barcelona Olympics </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sol_66@btinternet.com\">sol_66@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "Tony Blair might have thought he was on a strictly private holiday when he stepped off a white, police-escorted helicopter into Silvio Berlusconi's sumptuous Sardinian estate on Monday. <p>But his showman host had a different idea in mind.</p> <p>Late on Monday night after a high-security, low-publicity arrival, the Italian prime minister took Tony and Cherie for a \"spin\" in his 20-metre (65 ft) Magnum motorboat. The boat docked unexpectedly at Porto Quadu, a small coastal village. The three walked through seething crowds of holidaymakers, many dripping with gold jewellery as they enjoyed the local pasttime: VIP-spotting on Italy's most expensive coastline. </p> <p>The Blairs, dressed in pale, relaxed summer clothes, were driven on to nearby Porto Cervo, another of the Costa Smeralda's favourite celebrity holiday spots. There, they bought a book and a set of locally made ceramic dishes. </p> <p>Their flamboyant host somewhat stole the limelight, dressed in a floppy white linen pyjama-like outfit, and sporting a white bandana on his 67-year-old head. </p> <p>Local reporters said the unusual headwear may have been needed to cover scars from a hair implant operation the Italian leader may have undergone during his summer break. His bald patch has grown noticeably over the last year. </p> <p>An aide said the headwear was just his latest style. \"There is no bandana strategy,\" he said. </p> <p>Back at the Villa Certosa, the Blairs were treated to a lavish meal with about 20 guests, including Mr Berlusconi's wife, Veronica, their two children, Eleanora and Luigi, and his mother, Rosa. The meal ended with Mr Berlusconi's favourite tricolore, red, white and green ice cream. Mariano, owner of a bar in nearby Porto Rotondo, said he had delivered 10 kilos for the Blairs' visit. </p> <p>The guests then listened to a concert in the recently completed Greek-style amphitheatre. The night ended with a firework display which included a blaze of the words \"Viva Tony\" (Long Live Tony) reflected in a lake. </p> <p>Downing Street had insisted the Blairs' visit was a private, low profile affair. </p> <p>But Italian newspapers were not surprised when the Berlusconi roadshow hit two busy spots on the Costa Smeralda. </p> <p>\"The concept of low profile is of course relative,\" La Repubblica newspaper said. </p> <p>\"Nobody believes Il Cavaliere would have kept the English premier to himself, keeping him shut up in Villa Certosa,\" wrote the local newspaper Nuova Sardegna. </p> <p>Yesterday the two leaders talked shop during a morning walk along Mr Berlusconi's private stretch of coast. </p> <p>They then kicked a football around with their aides. Their wives spent the morning in the 73-room villa. </p> <p>The couple flew out of Olbia airport at 4pm back to the villa of their friend Prince Guicciardini Strozzi near San Gimignano, in Tuscany, where two of their children were waiting for them. </p> <p>Although the visit was technically private, Blair and Bersluconi spoke to the US president, George Bush, in a conference call on Tuesday morning.</p>",
  "What is the rationalist to do? Atheists, feminists and anti-racists are paralysed by Islam. Whichever way they turn, they find themselves at risk of alliances with undesirables of every nasty hue. <p>Last month, the website of an organisation called the Islamic Human Rights Commission made me the \"winner\" of their \"Most Islamophobic media personality\" award. It has caused me a bombardment of emails of both extreme pro- and anti-Islamic poison, each one more luridly threatening than the last. The occasional note of reason from moderate Islamic groups is so weak it hardly makes itself heard. I had challenged the legitimacy of the idea of Islamophobia and warned of the danger to free speech of trying to make criticism of a religion a crime akin to racism. I pointed out yet again that theocracy is lethal. Wherever religion controls politics it drives out tolerance and basic human rights. The history of Christianity has been the perfect exemplar, a force for repression whenever it holds any political sway. It only turns peace-loving when it is powerless.</p> <p>People led by some unalterable revealed voice of God cannot be tolerant of the godless. At present it is Islamic states that head the danger list - though the dread power of southern Baptists in US politics endangers world peace, as do extreme Jewish sects holding power in Israel. Women are always the main victims, since extreme religions express their identities through male priestly supremacy and disgust of women.</p> <p>To give a flavour of the Islamic Human Rights Commission awards, Nick Griffin of the BNP won the most Islamophobic British politician award, Jacques Chirac and Ariel Sharon shared the international Islamophobic politician award and Islamophobe of the year was George Bush. That's the company I found myself in.</p> <p>When Griffin was interviewed on Newsnight after he was filmed saying disgusting things about Muslims, bizarrely accusing Islam of encouraging the rape of non-Muslim girls, he quoted my name in general support. So these days criticising any aspect of Islam risks landing you down among the worst racists.</p> <p>Other voices claim you for their cause. There is a particularly virulent swirl of extreme Hindu emails spreading fear and loathing of Muslims. But it's not all one-sided. A dangerous stream of Muslim anti-semitic venom also billows out on to the airways, inciting maximum hatred against Jews and sometimes Christians. </p> <p>The government wants to make incitement to religious hatred a crime, caving in to a vociferous Muslim campaign, although it is unlikely to make a spit of difference to these rabid religious enmities. (If the government really wants to foster religious harmony, it should abolish all religious schools, not build more.) To reassure outraged rationalists, ministers say that only a couple of people a year are expected to be prosecuted under it. So, why bother? That will inflame the religious even more as they refer case after case, expecting the law to protect their right not to be offended by mockery or criticism. They want religion placed in a realm beyond ordinary argument - and it is beginning to happen. </p> <p>Fear of offending the religious is gathering ground on all sides. It is getting harder to argue against the hijab and the Koran's edict that a woman's place is one step behind. It is beginning to be racist for teachers or social workers to object to autocratic patriarchy and submission of women within many Muslim communities. Islamic ideas that find the very notion of democracy incompatible with faith are beginning to be taken seriously by those who should defend liberal democracy. </p> <p>Of course most Muslims are not extremists. They speak of the peacefulness of their faith - as most religious people do. But they still too rarely speak out against terror when they should be combating their own extremists and being seen to do it. Moderate groups protest often against arrests of Muslim terror suspects, while the Muslim Council of Britain has sent out just one tepid call to mosques to cooperate with the police. Moderates excuse, rather than refute, the many ferocious verses calling for the blood of infidels in their holy book, verses that justify terror. Both the Koran and the Bible ought to be banned under the new law, since both are full of God's incitements to smite unbelievers. </p> <p>It is bizarre how the left has espoused the extreme Islamist cause: as \"my enemy's enemy\", Muslims are the best America-haters around. The hard left relishes terrorism: a fondness for explosions and the smell of martyrs' blood excites their revolutionary zeal, without sharing a jot of religious belief. </p> <p>More alarming is the softening of the brain of liberals and progressives. They increasingly find it easier to go with the flow that wants to mollify Muslim sentiment, for fear of joining the anti-immigration thugs who want to drive them from the land. </p> <p>The liberal dilemma over Islam is not unlike the prevarications of some over communism in the cold war. To attack the atrocities of the reds put you in bed with the anti-socialist Thatcher/Reagan red-baiters. What would George Orwell write about Islam now? He would probably ignore what others said about the company he kept, shrug off those claiming him for their own ends and plough his own furrow, speaking out against both the danger of religious fanaticism and the Muslim-hating racists - the polite ones in Times immigration panic articles or those with steel-toed boots on the streets of northern towns. </p> <p>There is a coherent non-Islamophobic position and Turkey holds the key. Here is a democratic Islamic society, where the radical secularising reforms of Kemal Ataturk make it a model for states needing to escape a theocratic past. It is progressing fast to meet human rights and economic criteria for joining the EU and should be welcomed with open arms, as a symbolic embrace for moderate secular Islam. Giscard d'Estaing's claim that the EU is \"Christendom\" was sheer racism, the same deranged clash-of-civilisations thinking that led to the disastrous Iraq war. </p> <p>Expecting a terrorist attack on Britain soon, this week the Muslim Council of Britain and chief police officers are preparing a booklet for Muslim households, warning them to prepare for a backlash. If these grim events happen, it will be more important than ever to keep a rational perspective on both the Muslim community and its back-lashers. Fellow-travelling with terrorism, either within the Muslim community, or by the left and woolly minded progressives, will not serve. </p> <p>It will be more important than ever to stand like Voltaire, ready to defend Muslims, their right to be here and to practise their beliefs against the growing swamped-by-aliens talk that Anas Altikriti warned against on these pages last week. But if he wants to stop the right \"smearing and demonising\" Islam, it would be wise to be more outspoken against its deformed branch that fosters terror. Muslims must also accept the right of others to criticise religions without smearing any critic as a racist.</p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "What is exceptional about the violence of the government-backed Janjaweed militia in Darfur, is less its scale than the intense - if belated - international attention it has received. <p>To oppose direct western intervention in Sudan is not to downplay Khartoum's crimes during this latest twist in the catastrophic war that has cost perhaps two million lives since 1983. Over the last 20 years, in order to shore up their exclusive and authoritarian rule, Sudan's succession of military rulers have done everything possible to sustain an often imaginary distinction between \"Arabs\" and \"Africans\", pitting Muslims against Christians and herders against farmers . </p> <p>Before we jump to the conclusion that benevolent invasion, however, is the natural consequence of our new-found humanitarian duties, we should remember that this won't be the first time that either Britain or the US has intervened in Sudan. An earlier moral crusade, the \"war against slavery\", provided much of the ostensible justification for British colonisation of the region at the end of the 19th century. Britain's disastrous southern policy, inaugurated in 1929, made permanent the long-standing division between a relatively prosperous (mainly Muslim) northern territory and a much poorer (mainly animist or Christian) southern territory. The war that began between these two territories even before the British abandoned the colony in 1956 entered its most violent phase shortly after the Americans began backing, in the late 70s, the flagging regime of Sudan's increasingly reactionary General Gaafar Nimeiri. </p> <p>The resulting chaos created the conditions for the Taliban-style reaction whose effects continue to shape the situation even today. In Sudan, the backlash against US meddling came in the form of Hassan al-Turabi's National Islamic Front, and in 1989 a new regime took over, an unstable combination of Turabi's NIF and another military clique led by general Omar al-Bashir. Bashir and Turabi turned Sudan against its cold war ally, strengthened the divisive enforcement of Islamic law and devoted new resources to the assault on the underdeveloped south. </p> <p>Despite this history, until the public relations war in Iraq started going so badly a couple of months ago it seemed that Sudan might have done enough to ward off further US hostility. Since 1997, the country has adhered to a strict IMF restructuring plan that has seen foreign investment and oil exports (along with arms imports) soar. Since 9/11, Bashir has provided the US with a steady stream of much-vaunted intelligence. Apparent progress over the last couple of years towards a power-sharing peace accord between Bashir and John Garang in the south allowed George Bush to trumpet a rare foreign policy success, one that finally offered US investors the prospect of access to Sudan's oil. </p> <p>But Bush's opportunity to adopt an election-season cause that can appeal, simultaneously, to fundamentalist Christians, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, multilateralist liberals and the altruistic \"left\" may now be too tempting to pass up. </p> <p>The crisis in Darfur clearly meets several of the criteria that must apply before Blair and his allies feel morally obliged to put an end to the abuse of \"universal\" human rights. First of all, the aggressor should be off the payroll: this rules out Turkey, Indonesia, Colombia, Israel. More importantly, the victims to be saved should lack an organised, militant movement. This rules out Palestine. Failing that, these victims should appear as helpless refugees in the wake of such a movement's defeat - this is why we are talking about intervention now rather than during the spring of 2003. </p> <p>Finally, there should be little prospect of any awkward political issue interfering with the primary purpose of such humanitarian missions, namely the moral validation of western power. This has long been enough to exclude genuine concern about the sale of arms, the spread of Aids, the consequences of structural adjustment policies and the ruinous terms of international trade. </p> <p>The rest of us should not pretend, though, that another round of \"humanitarian intervention\" would represent anything other than the soft face of that same imperialism so hard at work today in Gaza, Afghanistan and Iraq. Fresh from an illegal and deceitful war of aggression, Anglo-US forces now have only one moral responsibility: to stay at home. </p> <p>The alternative is certainly not passive resignation. We should fund the immediate and forceful deployment of African peacekeepers and build on the example recently set by Paul Kagame's Rwanda. We should help the African Union become an effective and independent political actor, capable of brokering equitable political solutions to the long-standing conflicts that western intervention, almost always, has only helped provoke. We should press our governments to reverse the policies that contribute to poverty and violence in Sudan and its neighbours. </p> <p>Most importantly, we should learn to approach conflicts like the wars in Sudan in terms of actors and principle rather than victims and confusion. Where they exist, we should lend direct political support to movements working for justice and equality. </p> <p>Had we been serious about the claims of Darfur's farmers for a more equitable distribution of wealth, we should have explored ways of contributing to their non-violent pursuit, or else supported the Sudan Liberation Army when it launched its initially successful rebellion in February 2003 - not simply waited to provide charity to its survivors in the refugee camps of 2004. </p> <p>And if we are still serious about the SLA's claims now, then we should debate their merits and decide whether, and how, to help those struggling to achieve them. This is a political question before it is a moral or humanitarian one. Today's humanitarian crisis is precisely a result of past political failure. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:peter.hallward@kcl.ac.uk\">Peter Hallward</a> teaches at King's College London and is the author of Absolutely Postcolonial.</p>",

  "The head of Italy's coastguard yesterday stepped into a growing row over illegal immigration with a sharp reminder to Silvio Berlusconi's rightwing government of its humanitarian responsibilities. <p>Admiral Eugenio Sicurezza, whose officers are in the front line of attempts to stem clandestine migration, told a newspaper interviewer: \"The fact is that we have to take responsibility for the lives of these poor wretches. Full stop. There is no question that is the way it is. No mariner would ever let people die at sea.\" </p> <p>The humanitarian issue has become central to the debate because of a change in tactics by the migrant-traffickers. </p> <p>Instead of running their human cargoes into Italian territorial waters for clandestine, often nocturnal, landings, they have taken to casting them loose in the Mediterranean aboard boats which Admiral Sicurezza said were \"at the limits of seaworthiness\". </p> <p>His remarks appeared to be a riposte to renewed protests from the Northern League, one of the four main parties in Mr Berlusconi's coalition. </p> <p>On Sunday Roberto Calderoli, a league minister, called for the \"use of force against anyone trying - by force - to enter Italian territory illegally\". </p> <p>The highly charged debate acquired new emotional overtones yesterday after it was learnt that a Senegalese immigrant had died rescuing an Italian who got into difficulties while swimming off a beach on the Tuscan coast. </p> <p>The authorities in the province of Livorno, where 27-year-old Cheikh Sarr lost his life said they were trying to trace his widow in Senegal to provide her with a pension. </p> <p>One of the proudest claims of Mr Berlusconi's government is to have cut drastically the rate of illegal immigration. </p> <p>But in recent weeks it has been embarrassed by the landing on Italy's southern islands of boatloads of migrants whose vessels were found drifting in the Mediterranean. </p> <p>At the weekend the government claimed the rate of illegal entries into southern Italy had been almost halved in the previous 12 months. But Mr Calderoli said the figures did not take account of a sharp rise in the number of people rescued at sea, and denounced what he called \"the failure of controls on [Italy's] seas and coasts\". </p> <p>In an interview with the daily Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, Admiral Sicurezza acknowledged that rescues had increased. But he added: \"As a civilised nation, we cannot but take responsibility for the safety of these people. It is a juridical obligation. But it is also, and above all, a moral one ... when there are people in difficulty at sea there is only one rule - save them.\" </p> <p>Most of the recent arrivals have embarked in Libya. </p> <p>Earlier this month almost 30 Africans died of cold and dehydration before a further 75 barely conscious survivors were saved by a merchant ship. Italy and Germany afterwards made a joint appeal for immigration \"gateways\" to be established outside Europe to help regulate the flow of would-be immigrants.</p>",

  "The Australian prime minister, John Howard, has been accused of deceiving the public over a claim that refugees had endangered their children's lives by throwing them overboard in front of coastguards. <p>Mr Howard made the allegation during the last days of the 2001 election as the main parties argued over border security. </p> <p>A former senior adviser to Australia's defence minister has now come forward and said he told Mr Howard on three occasions that the story of refugees throwing children into the water was untrue. </p> <p>Mike Scrafton's claims were seized upon by the Labor opposition leader, Mark Latham, who said he would demand the reopening of an inquiry into the incident. </p> <p>\"Mr Howard has been badly caught out and shown that he's not fit to hold the high office of prime minister in this country,\" he said. </p> <p>The so-called \"children overboard\" affair was a battleground of the 2001 election campaign, which Mr Howard is widely considered to have won because of the opposition's perceived weakness on border security. </p> <p>Just over a month before the election, a single confused report from one coastguard boat led to claims that refugees had been throwing their children into the sea so that coastguard officers would be forced to rescue them and accept them as asylum seekers. </p> <p>Photographs of the purported incident sent to newspapers later turned out to have been pictures of coastguards saving passengers after a boat, dubbed the Siev-4, sank while it was being towed.</p>",

As far as I can tell, everybody gets 9 just for turning up for each event, followed by an extra bit for all their pikes, flips and tucks. Suffice to say, two Romanians in a row have just burned up the floor, with Oana Ban scoring 9.437. Unless their last performer has a total nightmare, I'm almost certain they'll take the gold medal. </p> <p> <strong>21:05pm:</strong> A lull at the moment in the women's gymnastics, as the teams that aren't in medal contention getting their floor routines out of the way before the United States and Romania take to the floor. Russia currently lead. </p> <p><strong>20:50pm:</strong> The state of play in the women's team gymnastics, which is still being shown on the Beeb, is this: Romania are in the lead, followed by the USA, Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China, France, Australia. </p> <p><strong>20:48pm:</strong> Mexico beat host Greece 3-2 in an action-packed football match, only to discover they had still been knocked out of the Olympic Games. After celebrating their victory, the Mexicans heard the other group game had finished 3-3 between Mali and South Korea - a result that meant they were eliminated. </p> <p>Omar Bravo scored twice after Rafael Marquez had put the Mexicans ahead. Ioannis Taralidis replied with a penalty when his team was already 2-0 down and the second Greek goal from Ieroklis Stoltidis came in injury time with the Mexicans coasting to victory. </p> <p>The result meant Mexico finished with four points and Greece one - a sad ending for the host after its senior team had won Euro 2004 six weeks ago. But the tie in Thessaloniki gave both Mali and Korea five points each. </p> <p> <strong>20:35pm:</strong> US sprinter Torri Edwards will definitely not participate in the Games after an arbitration panel upheld her two-year drug suspension, saying she should have known tablets provided by her doctor contained a banned substance. Edwards had been considered a medal contender in the 100 and 200 meters at the Athens Games. She inherited the world championship in the 100 when Kelli White forfeited that crown because of drug use. </p> <p><strong>20:25pm:</strong> Watching these ladies perform on the beam is like looking at a small child playing alone beside a river - nerve-wracking, yet strangely spellbinding. Svetlana Khorkina scores 9.347 after a delightful performance, but the crowd and BBC commentator Barry Davies are unhappy - they think she could have got more. </p> <p> <strong>20:15pm:</strong> Evening all. Barry Glendenning here. Left all alone and in charge of this rolling report? Watching the women's team gymnastics? With <em>my</em> reputation? Sorry - feeble Fast Show rip-offs aside, this is rivetting stuff with some downright freaky shows of athleticism on display. Romania lead at the moment, with the Ukraine in second place and the United States in third. </p> <p>Meanwhile on the basketball court, there's more bad news for the Yanks where Allen Iverson has a broken right thumb but made the starting lineup against Greece. Team USA are hoping to, eh, bounce back from an embarrassing loss to Puerto Rico in their opener. </p> <p> <strong>7.55pm</strong> I would like to continue all night, but my colleague Barry Glendenning is champing at the bit to give you his insights into the technical merits of the gymnastics. So, I'll bid you adieu, say thank you for your emails, and leave you with the knowledge that the USA lead the women's team event, the Romanians are in second, and the Ukrainians third.</p> <p><strong>7.48pm </strong> The shocks continue on the tennis courts. Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schuettler have defeated Australian second seeds Wayne Arthurs and Todd Woodbridge 7-6(8-6), 6-3. Woodbridge is a perennial winner of the Wimbledon doubles, but reputation is proving to be worthless at the Olympics. In the gymnastics, the Romanians are on the asymmetric bars but not scoring as high as expected, with Monica Rosu only being awarded 9.387. America are setting the early pace.</p> <p><strong>7.37pm </strong> While we wait for the gymnastics to burst into life, Gabrielle Grundy has a question. \"Which of our plucky swimmers is from Derby? I'm living in Washington DC and this morning on television the presenter was talking to the parents of a British swimmer that was competing today. The presenter didn't even ask what their son's name was! All I know is they were from Derby. Until I found your web updates I was missing the equally impartial British coverage of the Olympics. Thank you!\" Always eager to please, Gabrielle, but sadly on this occasion I do not yet have an answer for you. I'm trailing the profiles of all our swimmers competing today but have not yet come up trumps. Can anyone out there help? And just to prove we can concentrate on non-British matters, Argentina are beating Australia 1-0 at half-time in the football, and Greece are drawing 0-0 with Mexico. Expect the Greeks to grab a 1-0 victory - they usually do.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm </strong> The women's gymnastics team event has begun, though the \"girls' team event\" would be a more apt description. A pre-pubescent Ukrainian is currently flying through the air at break-neck speed while performing a double somersault tuck. Romania are the favourites for the gold medal, though Svetlana Khorkina, comfortably the eldest of the competitors at 25, leads a strong Russian team. Barry Davies, who is almost old enough to be the great-grandfather of some of these little (4ft 11in average height) ladies, has said there is no room for any error because every score counts. There's bound to be some tears later methinks. </p> <p><strong>7.09pm </strong> I said it should be some race, and boy it certainly was. Ian Thorpe went into the last leg for Australia eight metres behind the Americans, but slowly crept up on Klete Keller, only for the US to take the gold by just 13 hundredths of a second. According to Adrian Moorhouse, Thorpe is 75% fish and 25% human.It certainly is an intriguing theory, but I for one would quite like to know how Moorhouse arrived at these figures. The Brits put in a commendable performance, narrowly missing out on third place to the Italians. That's the swimming over for another day, and the British can be relatively proud of their efforts. The BBC are currently reading out emails from viewers, which is making us feel a bit left out. </p> <p><strong>6.52pm </strong> Yana Klotchkova, of Ukraine, has won the women's 400m individual medley, adding to the gold she won in the 200m medley. The men's 4x200m freestyle relay is up next, so this is a good time to make this Olympics update international. \"South African greetings to all! Well done to home boys in the 400m freestyle relay,\" writes Caryn Voight. And greetings to you to, Caryn, and, yes, congratulations to your 400m relay winners. GB line up in lane six in the 4x200m, alongside the formidable Aussies and Americans. It should be some race.</p> <p><strong>6.40pm </strong> One of the quirks of the Olympics is that there can be a long stretch when absolutely nothing happens. Then, suddenly, there's big stories everywhere, and national anthems (usually American or Chinese) going off all around the city. Given that this is one of the latter moments, you'd think I wouldn't be wasting time with such waffle and would be hurriedly pressing my keyboard to give you the news. Well, I'm afraid I'm going to pause for a moment while Stephen Parry is presented with his bronze medal by Princess Anne. The joy on Parry's face as the Union jack climbs the pole to the sound of \"Oh say can you see...\" is a fine sight. Maybe one day we might even have the chance to listen to \"God save the Queen.\"</p> <p><strong>6.30pm </strong> Less cheery news from the pool: Briton Chris Cook has finished eighth out of eight in the first semi-final of the 200m breaststroke. Japan's Kosuke Kitayama, who won the race, was in and out of the pool, showered and on the bus back to the Olympic village by the time Cook had finished, somewhat disappointing given that BBC commentators were claiming he had the ability to follow Parry's lead. Oh, and what's this? In the second semi Ian Edmond finished fifth, but has been disqualified for an illegal kick off the wall. He's being interviewed as I write, and livid is the only way to describe his reaction.</p> <p><strong>6.18pm </strong> \"Great news, but what time did Parry get? Break any records?\" Tim Aldridge enquires. He certainly did. Parry swam 1:55.52mins, not only a British record, but also a Commonwealth record. And how did he get himself so psyched up for the final? By watching Rocky in his room, that's how. No word of a lie. For the record, Michael Phelps broke the Olympic record in 1:54.02. </p> <p><strong>6.08pm </strong> Roger Federer has tumbled from the men's singles. Tomas Berdych, of the Czech Republic, beat the world No1 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 to spring the shock of the Olympics so far. Unless you think that Brazil's women's football team beating their Greek counterparts 7-0 is a bigger surprise. No, didn't think so. Georgina Lee finished fifth in her 200m butterfly semi, narrowly missing out on tomorrow's final. But it doesn't matter, we're still living off the euphoria of winning a medal!</p> <p><strong>5.58pm BRONZE FOR PARRY </strong> Shout it from the roof-tops - we've won another medal! Stephen Parry has taken the bronze, and a big kiss from Sharon Davies, for Great Britain in the 200m butterfly. Michael Phelps won the gold as expected, but he was pushed close by Parry and Takashi Yamamoto, who finished second. Parry has said he hopes this gets the ball rolling for all our competitors. So say all of us.</p> <p><strong>5.49pm </strong> Romania's Camelia Potec has surprised everyone by winning the 100m freestyle from lane one. Frederica Pellegrini took the silver and Solenne Figues the bronze. My tip, Francisca van Almsick, was a disappointing fifth. Not surprising really. Now, for British fans, it's the big one: Britain's Stephen Parry v America's Michael Phelps. Parry beat him yesterday, but can he do it when it really matters? The Beeb's commentators are barely able to contain their excitement, and so, quite frankly, am I. And they're off...</p> <p><strong>5.45pm </strong> Alexander Popov, one of the favourites for the title, has missed out on the 100m freestyle final. Roland Mark Schoeman, of South Africa, won the second semi, while five swimmers were faster than Popov's time, squeezing the Russian out. Ian Thorpe scraped through with the eighth quickest time, while world record holder Pieter van den Hoogenband will also compete in the final. Now it's the women's 200m freestyle final, for which Britain's Melanie Marshall was the favourite coming into the games, but finished last in her semi-final. Instead Francisca van Almsick, a model from Germany, is the favourite for a first gold medal in her fourth Olympics.</p> <p><strong>5.35pm </strong> Claire Harrison writes: \"This is probably a stupid question but any chance of hearing how 'our boy Stephen' gets on against Phelps in the swimming - I think this is about to go on?\" Claire, you do yourself a disservice. The race takes place at 5.50, so stay tuned in. First, it's the men's semi-finals of the 100m freestyle, and the first one has thrown up a shock. Ian Thorpe was pushed down to third place, behind Salim Iles of Algeria. Russian legend Alexander Popov finished fourth, and is waiting anxiously for the second semi to see if he has reached the final. Adrian Moorhouse would like everyone to know that Tarzan won this event in the 1920s and also broke 53 world records.</p> <p><strong>5.25pm </strong> Despite the elimination of Tim Henman, the men's singles continues unabated. Spain's Tommy Robredo came from a set down to beat Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, while tenth seed Nicolas Massu knocked out American Vincent Spadea in straight sets. The BBC are showing Laurence Godfrey's victory in the last 16 of the archery for the third time in an hour and a half. I suppose we have to revel in what few victories we have, don't we?</p> <p><strong>5.15pm </strong> There's a pause in the action, so allow me to fill you in on tonight's swiming finals. In addition to the women's 200m freestyle, there's also the women's 200m individual medley. Britain line up in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay after impressive qualification this morning, but they will be up against the USA, and Ian Thorpe and Australia. The highlight, though, could be the 200m butterfly in which Stephen Parry has looked very impressive to date. I predicted a medal for Parry earlier, but as Frances Green has rightly pointed out: \"Just by saying this you have condemned us to another miserable failure!\"</p> <p><strong>5.00pm </strong> With troubled Greek duo Kostas Kederis and Katerina Thanou leaving hospital today, an independent assessment has revealed the sprinters are suffering from no serious injuries. Kederis merely has scratches on his shin and right elbow, while Thanou has no medical ailment whatsoever. It does make you wonder why they have been in hospital since Thursday night following their alleged motorbike accident.</p> <p><strong>4.50pm </strong> OK, I may have spoken too soon. Kellogg and Emms have lost nine points in a row since I last wrote, and are now 13-4 down in the deciding game. Meanwhile, tennis third seed Carlos Moya has beaten Olivier Rochus 6-0, 7-6(7-3) to progress to the third round. And that's it, the Chinese have won the badminton doubles. My optimism was misplaced. We're never going to win another medal.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm </strong> Donna Kellogg and Gail Emms are battling in an engrossing badminton match against two Chinese girls. Kellogg's forehand is being exposed a little, but the pair are still in the match at one set all and 5-4 down. Luke Satchell wants to know: \"What does this astounding performance by (archer) Laurence Godfrey mean for our otherwise rubbish medal chances then, Mike?\" Listen everyone, try not to get too depressed. We may only have one medal, but as Steve Cram was saying yesterday, we've still got our big sports to come. And I'm going to stick my neck on the line here and say that Stephen Parry is going to get a medal for us tonight in the butterfly. Now there's optimism for you.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm </strong> Simon Whawell (PhD no less) asks: \"Any news on the 'heroic spectator's' marks in the diving last night? I bet it will be more than the Chinese pairing (0) which brought back memories of that John Smith's advert.\" I, too, saw the rather harsh marking which resulted in a 0 for the Chinese pair. It was a tad unfair considering that earlier that evening a Chinese gymnast (his name has drifted from my memory) fell from the bar twice, and yet still notched up a 9.125 mark. Would any of you like to judge our hero's dive? Hungary have beaten Greece 33-20 in a women's volleyball group match. Yes, that really is the best I can offer you for now. News on a big women's badminton match involving our girls is coming up soon though.</p> <p><strong>4.20pm </strong> I am sitting here with my head in my hands, lifting my cranium only briefly to cut and paste the following from Fotis Kollias. \"Dear sir, There is no Marion Simitsek... The real name of CEO of Athens 2004 Organising Comittee is Marton Simitsek. And if you will meet him you will see that he has a bear... So, obviously, he is not a woman...\" Fotis, and indeed Mr Marton (yes, Mr Marton) Simitsek, you have my wholehearted apologies. Belgium's Justine Henin-Hardenne has beaten Venezuela's Maria Vento-Kabchi 6-2, 6-1 in the women's tennis singles.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm </strong> Due to the lack of wind at Piraeus, today's sailing has actually been more just floating than anything else. Paul Goodison will almost certainly have to discard today's result, as he finished a disappointing 28th. He now lies 12th overall. Brazilian Robert Scheidt - pronounce it carefully - remains top of the Laser class, and is virtually guaranteed the gold medal, particularly with his nemesis of the past two Olympics, Ben Ainslie, competing in the Finn class this time around.</p> <p><strong>4.00pm </strong> In the Panathinaiko stadium, where the modern Olympics began in 1896, British archer Laurence Godfrey has produced an outstanding performance to beat Atlanta silver medallist and one of the favourites Magnus Petersson 163-162. Housewives' favourite Craig Doyle introduced the match-up by saying it's like trying to hit a grapefruit from 70m with a bow and arrow. Pretty impressive.</p> <p><strong>3.45pm </strong> And the wily Japanese lady has taken the gold - that's her nation's fourth on the judo mat. I didn't really expect anything else. The judo news keeps coming in, with Greek Ilias Iliadis sending the home crowd wild, defeating Roman Gontyuk, of Ukraine, in double-quick time to win another gold for the hosts. It looked to me like Gontyuk was actually in control of the winning fling, but Eurosport's commentator knows more than me, and is fairly adamant the ruling is correct. Colin P feels aggrieved by Britain's paltry medal tally to date, especially as it was in synchronised diving. \"When did that become a sport? If London gets the Olympics in the next century, darts should definitely be allowed in.\" Well, Colin, I quite agree, but I should also point out that we would probably lose to Dutch duo Ray Barneveld and Roland \"The Tripod\" Scholten, and Canada's John Part, thus leaving us outside the medals once more. Oh, and off the top of my head, synchronised diving became an Olympic sport in 1996.</p> <p><strong>3.36pm </strong> It's judo now. I'm not entirely sure how they score this particularly sport, but I can tell you that it's the final of the women's under-63kg category. Ayumi Tanimoto, of Japan, is fighting Austria's Claudia Heill. There are some shoulder tosses, lots of lying on each other, and some rather rigorous arm-tugging. Sorry if you can't wait to find out who will take the gold medal, but you will have to until the next update, as this contest is still continuing. Tanimoto leads I am informed.</p> <p><strong>3.25pm </strong> Good news and bad news for British hopes. Good first. Britain's men's quad sculls managed a late surge to take them past the French and secure qualification for the semi-finals. Now the bad. Badminton medal hope Richard Vaughan has crashed out of the men's singles at the last 16 stage to Korean Seung Mo Shon 15-9, 15-4. As if that wasn't enough, Ella Tripp and Joanne Wright have compounded a poor session at the Goudi Olympic Hall for British hopes, losing in just 40 minutes to fifth-seeded Dutch pair Mia Audina and Lotte Bruil. </p> <p><strong>3.17pm </strong> Marion Simitsek is a busy woman (I presume she is a woman). Not content with dealing with love-sick loons, she is now denying vicious allegations of poisoning Athens' dogs to make the city more tourist-friendly. \"We are in close collaboration with the the proper authorities. Any dogs we do take away are sterilised and taken to places where they are fed,\" she murmured. Our athletes have arrived in Athens ahead of action beginning in the Olympic stadium this weekend. Confidence is high in the camp we are led to believe. Let's hope so because we have still only won one medal (a silver in synchronised diving), and all the other countries are starting to laugh at us.</p> <p><strong>3.07pm </strong> The heroic spectator who dived into the pool last night - the Olympics' equivalent of a streaker - did so for the love of a woman apparently. I'll let Olympics chief of operations Marion Simitsek explain: \"A man very much in love with his wife wanted to show it so he bought a ticket, came inside and chose to dive in the pool. We have taken measures so this does not happen again and we are going to put security guys around the field of play dressed in our staff dress.\" The sailing is continuing to be disrupted by the wind, or lack of it. Meanwhile, the rowing has been disrupted because of blustery conditions. Just a suggestion, but why not swap the two venues around? Oh, there is some rowing on now. It's the men's lightweight four repechage. First three through. Only one team drops out. And on the line ... it's Britain. </p> <p><strong>2.52pm</strong> Right, that's the end of me for today. My colleague Mike Adamson will now be taking over and will hopefully bring the charm and wit that has been sadly lacking during the last three hours. I'm off for my daily fix of Steve Holdsworth on Eurosport's boxing coverage.</p> <p><strong>2.42pm</strong> Apart from the fact that he's a Man Utd fan, we rather like Darren Campbell. He's courteous, pleasant and has a welcome habit of winning medals: silver in the 200m in Sydney and bronze in the 100m at the World Champioships in Paris last year. Reigning OIympic champ Maurice Greene reckons Daz can finish in the top three in this year's 100m. \"When it comes to championships that guy is always ready to compete,\" said Kansas Cannonball Greene, \"so he's going to have to be one to look out for.\" You certainly think he'd be sharper than poor old Rob Key, who has come in for some fearful japes today. Here's another from Robert Cross: \"Key would surely be a contender in Olympic wrestling, especially if competitors were told that a bag of fresh-from-the-oven doughnuts were awarded to the victor.\"</p> <p><strong>2.26pm</strong> The repechage continues to do Britain proud in the rowing. After the success of Ian Lawson earlier this afternoon, Tracy Langlands and Helen Casey made it through to Thursday's semi-finals of the lightweight women's double sculls with second place in the repechage. And ta to Luke Meddings who, in reference to my earlier use of the phrase \"a brace of flying mammals,\" writes: \"Flying mammals? Are you sure?\" He obviously hasn't noticed the winged giraffes circling above Farringdon. Thanks, Luke.</p> <p><strong>2.19pm</strong> Kayak slalom: it should be our new national sport. Especially if Stuart McIntosh can build on his promising early form in tomorrow's C1 canoeing semi-finals. McIntosh qualified in fifth place and said: \"To finish only a second-and-a-half behind the leader having performed an eskimo roll down that second run shows that I'm in good shape.\" If kayak slalom weren't to capture the imagination, which other Olympic sport would you like to see knock football off the back pages? And don't say beach volleyball.</p> <p><strong>2.06pm</strong> Confetti, champagne and caviar, of the Beluga variety, for Mr Alex Marklew, who warded off the challenge of a host of competitors to be the first to tell us the capital of Benin. \"Porto-Novo, if my GCSE geography case study serves me true,\" says a very diffident Alex. Was he the only one for whom GCSE geography did not consist merely of colouring in maps? Meanwhile, after his match-winning 93 not out yesterday, Robert Key's appeal as an Olympian continues to grow in the shires. \"The Man of Kent would be pretty special in every single event,\" says Simon Thomas. \"Especially the vault and the rings in the gymnastics.\"</p> <p><strong>1.56pm</strong> Never one to shirk hyperbole, Costas Kenteris this afternoon looked ahead to the hearing that will determine his Olympic future by proclaiming: \"After the crucifixion comes the resurrection.\" A latter-day Homer if ever we saw one. The Olympic 200m champion missed a dope test five days ago and left hospital only today after undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in a motorcycle crash. Kenteris, and his training partner Katerina Thanou, will learn tomorrow evening whether they are to be banished from these Games for missing the tests.</p> <p><strong>1.46pm</strong> Thank heavens for the repechage! Not only can we rejoice at the appearance of this marvellous word - which is never heard except for two weeks once every four years - but it has produced a British semi-finalist in the single sculls rowing. Ian Lawson is into the semis after a fine late charge to win his repechage - cherish it - in six minutes, 56.55 seconds. And on the commentary front, Sam Wingfield believes his licence fee is full value for money: \"In response to the commentary gaffes, I was in stitches last night during the men's synchronised diving, firstly by the Chinese diver falling on his back and secondly by the BBC commentary which amounted to 'Oh my God'.\" Let's hear it for Auntie</p> <p><strong>1.40pm</strong> A truly outstanding suggestion from Mr Niall Howarth, who kills a brace of flying mammals with just the single hard projectile by answering the cricketing and commentary questions at once. Hats off, sir. \"How much more entertaining would the opening ceremony have been with Stuart Hall providing commentary? I know it's an obvious one but I'd certainly pay money to see Robert Key in the pole vault.\" Seem to have stumped you all with the capital of Benin, though...</p> <p><strong>1.31pm</strong> For all you fans of Tim Henman out there, there are some words of (albeit scant) consolation to soothe your aching hearts. His first-round conqueror, Jiri \"The Invincible\" Novak, must abandon his own dreams of gold after being beaten in straight sets by Mikhail Youzhny, the Russian who is always cheered on in the stands by his doppelganger brother and his extremely intimidating-looking father, in the second round. And don't worry folks, because Tiger Tim will DEFINITELY win Wimbledon next year.</p> <p><strong>1.24pm</strong> Ahmed Almaktoum, the new Olympic champion in the double trap, is the first-ever medallist in the Games from the United Arab Emirates. So a warm, prolonged round of applause and lots of crowd sounds on the effects mike for him, please. </p> <p><strong>1.05pm</strong> The sports may change, but the Brits keep on losing. Ella Tripp and Joanne Wright were unable to whack the shuttlecock as high or as prodigiously as their Dutch opponents Lotte Bruil and Mia Audina of the Netherlands, and were beaten 15-7 15-7 in the second round doubles of the badminton. Badminton was what you were forced to play in PE when it was raining outside in Yorkshire during my schooldays. Meanwhile, Ahmed Almaktoum of the United Arab Emirates has claimed gold in the double trap, and Eurosport have kindly informed us that Gaborone is the capital of Botswana. So what's the capital of Benin? No cheating, I'll be able to tell...</p> <p><strong>1.03pm</strong> Good old Eurosport. During a fairly tepid early bout in the boxing, their commentary team opted for the old favourite to keep the viewers entertained: the mixed metaphor. \"After the early rounds, the wheat is sorted from the chaff, and you're left with the cream,\" said Eurosport's man ringside, Alan Partridge-style, in Athens. With this as your inspiration, send me any commentary gaffes that have particularly tickled you during the first few days of competition. Paul Dickinson beware...</p> <p><strong>12.58pm</strong> After Tim Henman on Sunday, Juan Carlos Ferraro becomes the latest contender to crash out of the Olympic men's tennis event. The blond bombshell from Spain, seeded five, was clearly not himself as he lost 4-6 7-6 6-4 to the wonderfully-named Mardy Fish, of the United States, in the second round.</p> <p><strong>12.52pm</strong> Meanwhile, England's spin wizard should take advantage of his unexpected royal status, reckons Ben Mimmack. \"As the King of Spain, Ashley Giles will surely be seen applauding in a half-hearted fashion as the Spanish team comes into the stadium during the closing ceremony.\" After his 18 wickets in two Tests, the loveable Gilo was transformed into a monarch when Wawrickshire received dozens of requests for mugs bearing the inscription \"Ashley Giles, King of Spain.\" What's the odd vowel between friends, eh?</p> <p> <strong>12.38pm</strong> Kenteris' training partner, Katerina Thanou, has left hospital 45 minutes afterwards. The pair had been missing for five days since failing to take dope tests. \"I feel very saddened and disappointed by all that has been said. I will wait for the IOC decision tomorrow and will continue to fight,\" said sprinter Thanou.</p> <p><strong>12.28pm</strong> Greek sprinter Costas Kenteris, at the centre of a doping case dogging the Olympics, left an Athens hospital on Tuesday to appear in public for the first time for five days. Kenteris had been there since he and training partner Katerina Thanou were involved in a motorcycle crash shortly after missing dope tests on Thursday. There was no indication of Thanou's whereabouts. </p> <p><strong>12.19pm</strong> Helen Reeves qualifies for semi-finals of women's kayak with a strong run that increases hopes of another British medal.</p> <p> <strong>12.10pm</strong> After a nasty virus that ruled her out of Wimbledon, Justine Henin-Hardenne is back. The top-seeded Belgian defeated Maria Vento-Kabchi 6-2, 6-1 in the second round of the tennis. Right, folks, here's this afternoon's teaser. With cricket not likely to be an Olympic sport until 2012 at least, what current sports in Athens do you think England's Test marvels would excel in? Email me your thoughts and no obvious answers, please: you all know who I mean...</p> <p><strong>12.05pm</strong> Blustery conditions still casting doubt over whether rowing repechages can get underway. Wind saw all races cancelled yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>When I told friends I was planning to spend three months travelling around South America on an overland trip with 20 other people, they all asked me the same question: Aren't you worried about spending so much time with a bunch of strangers?</p> <p>Not wanting to appear less than confident about my choice of holiday, I would jauntily assert that I wasn't in the least concerned, because strangers are just friends you haven't met yet. But in truth I was terrified. I knew that strangers can just as easily be enemies you haven't made yet, or simply people who are, well, strange. The other major pre-trip doubt was whether spending a total of 400 hours and 12,000 miles on a truck would be in any way enjoyable. </p> <p>So it was with some trepidation that I arrived at the hotel in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito, where I was to get my first sight of the vehicle and the potential bunch of lunatics I was going to spend the next 12 weeks with. It turned out that I was not the only worrier. Most of the passengers later revealed that they spent most of the eve-of-departure meeting sizing each other up.</p> <p>But happily, first impressions were generally good, and a few drinks later most passengers went to bed reassured about their travelling companions and eager to begin the journey. But that was before we saw the truck.</p> <p>Nicknamed Pope 6 due to its resemblance to an overfed Popemobile, the 13-year-old, beige coloured Mercedes 1620, could not be described as a thing of beauty. But it looked sturdy enough, and, I thought to myself, as long it gets us from A to B, who cares what it looks like? However, within a few bumpy miles of leaving the city on the short drive to Ba\u00f1os in the south of the country, it became clear that the issue wasn't quite that simple. While the truck did indeed get us from A to B in the course of a day, it did so at such a leisurely pace that most other vehicles starting the day at A would probably be disappointed if they hadn't hit B by midmorning and C, or possibly D, by evening. </p> <p>But being one of life's optimists, I would argue that such stately progress gives you more time to take in the magnificent scenery, through the oversized windows, and wave at people as they overtake you on their bicycles. </p> <p>And the scenery was magnificent. On a route stretching from the equator to about 53 degrees south, taking in seven countries (Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil), and numerous different environments, how could it fail to be? We drove through deserts where it hasn't rained for 400 years, and visited jungles where it never stops raining. </p> <p>On one day in Ecuador, we spent several hours with only banana plantations to look at; later in the trip, in the high altiplano of Peru and Bolivia we came across more llamas than you could spit at, and in Patagonia we encountered more glacial features than you'd find in an A-level geography syllabus.</p> <p>But the truck was well equipped to deal with whatever the journey threw it at. The Exodus vehicles are specifically converted for the task of transporting people through all sorts of terrain. As well as up to 22 passengers and their luggage, the busses carry 300 litres of purified water, cooking equipment, 15 tents and many other apparently useless bits and pieces that suddenly become essential when you break down in the middle of the Atacama desert. Having said that, the amount of locker space assigned to each passenger was not large (when they said pack light, they meant it). </p> <p>And if someone really did want to test the patience of a saint, they couldn't do better than putting their canonised guinea pig on our truck with 20 other passengers all trying to get their clothes out of their lockers at the same time. This twice-daily ritual became one of the routine flash points of the trip, where irritation would occasionally flare into anger. </p> <p>It was at these times especially that some of us really did question the wisdom of embarking on such a journey. Driving days were generally long, and the longer the day, the shorter the tempers. (The longest drive, from Iguazu falls on the Argentina-Brazil border to the coast at Paraty, lasted 24 hours, and you can imagine what we were like by the time we alighted in the morning).</p> <p>Although there were surprisingly few outright rows, there were a number of petty arguments. And if you aren't sure what classifies as \"petty\", one of the most hotly contested, and oft-repeated contests was over the seat rotation policy - namely who got to sit in which seat on the truck and for how long. </p> <p>Another favourite area for debate concerned cook-group duties. This is because some of the passengers really didn't like having to cook. This inevitably led to friction with the rest of us, who really, really didn't like having to cook. By the time we had reached the southernmost point of our trip at Punta Arenas, in Chile, discussions about shopping, chopping, peeling and washing up were being carried out with an undercurrent of barely-suppressed violence. </p> <p>However, given the long list of everyday irritations, the surprising thing was not how often these flare-ups occurred but how seldom. We were a mixed bunch of people, with ages ranging across four decades, and we all had different expectations of, and requirements from, the holiday. Reconciling these needs was a tough task for our leader-drivers, who often needed to display the sort of diplomacy normally required for Middle East peace talks, or rows between pre-school infants. </p> <p>But it was this diversity that made the trip interesting too. As a social exercise it's hard to beat - there are very few situations in life where such a varied group of people can spend so much time together in such close proximity without starring in a reality TV show. Coincidentally, it was a little like Big Brother on wheels. After 10 hours of driving through the pouring rain, conversation is bound to take on a rather late-night-on-E4 quality; the subject that cropped up most often being basic bodily functions. </p> <p>The truck, for all its faults, was surprisingly comfortable, and we would never go for more than two or three hours without a stop. There was always a good lunch to look forward to (presuming members of the day's chosen cook group had not scratched each other's eyes out). Passengers also instituted an on-board bar (an icebox full of beer), which did help pass the time, but doubled the number of toilet stops.</p> <p>You could divide passengers into two groups according to how they spent their time on the truck. There were those who couldn't sleep and those who couldn't stay awake - and both groups ended up envying the other. The sleepers, who would generally drop off within minutes of departure, would complain that they were missing large swaths of countryside. Those who couldn't sleep thought wistfully how nice it would be to miss out on hour upon hour of on-board boredom.</p> <p>Another pre-departure concern for the passengers travelling solo was the fact that we had to share rooms - and more worryingly, tents - with people we didn't know. So the first night's camping, which came after four days at Punta Sal in northern Peru, was always going to be an unusual experience. Two-person tents are not large, so unless one is in the habit of frequenting brothels, rarely in life does one have the opportunity to spend the hours of darkness in such intimacy with someone whose name you can't quite remember. The first time you wake up to find your face just three inches from that of a gently snoring Scotsman is an experience you don't forget in a hurry. But within a few days, the lack of private space ceased to even register. We were all generally so tired (or drunk) by the end of the day that we found we could sleep anywhere.</p> <p>In the course of the trip, we saw and did far too much to describe in one article. Although we spent a long time driving, well over two-thirds of our days were actually spent away from the truck. There were many highlights - including the Inca trail (arriving at Machu Picchu on Christmas Day), seeing condors ride the early morning thermals at the Colca Canyon, and visiting the floating Uros islands of Lake Titicaca and fantastic cities like Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval. But it is some of the more unexpected, unlooked-for experiences that remain most firmly lodged in the mind. </p> <p>The three days spent driving down Chile's Camino Austral, took us through some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. On one memorable night we camped on the bend of a river, and decided to ditch the tents. We bedded down under the stars and fell asleep counting satellites as they whizzed silently across the southern sky. </p> <p>Another great experience was watching Cienciano, a lowly Peruvian football team from Cuzco (think of Reading FC), beat Argentina's mighty River Plate (South America's Juventus) in the final of the Copa Sudamericana. This was a genuine once-in-a-lifetime experience (and that almost certainly goes for the Cienciano players too). </p> <p>Such trips are not for everyone. And if your idea of hell is other people, it's unlikely that you'll get the most out of it. But for most of us, the cons were minor compared with the pros. An overland trip allows you to see and do an enormous amount of things in a relatively short time. You get to see exotic countries up close, but perhaps more interestingly, you get to see your fellow overlanders even closer. And although this was sometimes a challenging experience, it was, ultimately, a rewarding one. </p> <p><strong>Way to go:</strong></p> <p>This year South America Explorer trips with <a href=\"http://www.exodus.co.uk\">Exodus</a> (0870 240 5550) cost \u00a32,130 to \u00a32,210.</p> <p> But there are several extra costs:<br> 1) Flights (typically \u00a3500-\u00a3650)<br> 2) Compulsory local payment of US$800 (approx \u00a3480)<br> 3) Optional excursions - such as the not-to-be-missed five-day trip to the Peruvian rainforest - $600 (\u00a3330)<br> 4) Food and accommodation not covered by other payments: US$750 (approx \u00a3450) <br> 5) Spending money: $1,000 (\u00a3550)<br> 6) Insurance: \u00a3150-\u00a3180<br> 7) Jabs/malaria pills: about \u00a3100<br> Therefore, total cost for three months could reach \u00a35,000.</p> <p>The trip runs four times a year, and either starts in Quito (travelling anticlockwise to Rio) or starts in Rio and ends in Quito.</p>",

  "<p>Two colleagues who are getting married have decided to dispense with the traditional form of wedding list. Instead, Laura and Paul have asked their families and friends to dedicate trees at the Standen Hey forest, in Lancashire, as wedding gifts. </p> <p>\"With all the things we own, all the books and the records and the shoes, we decided we really didn't need any more belongings. So the only wedding present we'd like, please, is trees,\" they said.</p> <p>The wedding list with a difference (donating a tree costs \u00a310) can be found at Future Forests, a small London company that turned the \"save the planet, plant a tree\" adage into a business in 1997.</p> <p>It acts on the guiding principle that all of us, companies and individuals, must reduce current levels of carbon dioxide emissions by eliminating their release at source. </p> <p>Working with the Edinburgh centre for carbon management, Future Forests calculates how much carbon dioxide people and companies produce, and devises ways to reduce emissions. </p> <p>The schemes may involve using renewable energy suppliers or the \"offsetting\" of unavoidable emissions through, for example, tree planting programmes (trees reabsorb emissions) or energy saving projects in developing countries. </p> <p>The programme is called CarbonNeutral, which Future Forests has adopted as a registered trademark.</p> <p>Future Forests was founded by Dan Morrell, a former music business executive, and Sue Welland, who worked in advertising for 20 years. The idea came as they walked along Hanger Lane, in west London, which - as usual - was crawling with traffic. \"We saw the traffic and the trees - it was just pure schoolboy biology,\" Ms Welland says.</p> <p>The company, which has its headquarters near Euston station, had revenues of \u20ac2m (\u00a31.3m) last year and expects to break even this year - revenues have been growing by 60% a year since 2000. </p> <p>Although it started out with the idea of planting trees to soak up C02, Future Forests increasingly makes its money from fees for providing companies with advice on reducing emissions and devising marketing campaigns on how to achieve that goal. Its corporate clients include the car rental firm Avis Europe, Hilton (Trafalgar hotel), insurance giant Swiss Re, Barclays Bank and the mobile phone operator O2. The company is also working on energy saving projects in Eritrea, Sri Lanka and India.</p> <p>Most recently, it has teamed up with the Japanese car maker Honda. From September, buyers of new Hondas will be given a certificate telling them that carbon neutralising initiatives have effectively given them three months of emission-free driving.</p> <p>The new buyers will have a tree dedicated to them in one of five UK areas being planted for Honda by Future Forests. After three months, the new owners will be invited to buy into the scheme at a cost of \u00a38 for every three months.</p> <p>Future Forests plants trees at more than 60 sites in the UK, US, Mexico and India, and tree-planting holds tremendous allure for its clients - particularly, it seems, pop stars. </p> <p>\"The tree was a very effective method for engaging people,\" Jonathan Shopley, the chief executive of Future Forests, says. \"The icon of a tree that soaks up CO2 is massively important. We are very proud of the fact that we can use the tree to simplify the message.\"</p> <p>That message has gone down particularly well with celebrities, and the Future Forests webside has a long list of endorsements from musicians such as Coldplay and Kylie Minogue, and personalities including the former England football coach Kevin Keegan. The company says celebrity backing is a vital marketing tool, because it does not spend money on advertising.</p> <p>Mr Shopley acknowledges that planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide is not as effective as reducing emissions at source, and is an action after the fact. </p> <p>However, he argues that it is an effective tool against climate change until the widespread adoption of more energy-efficient technology.</p> <p>\"New technology is always more expensive until you build up demand, and renewing the capital base takes a lot. Don't underestimate the power of offset that then drives people to make better decisions or to think about the next generation of technology,\" he says.</p> <p>Like many in the environmental business, he criticises the government for not educating people about climate change and taking action to cut emissions - the demand side, as he puts it. </p> <p>He applauds ministers for setting visionary targets, but condemns the lack of practical policies aimed at achieving those goals. Britain has pledged to slash emissions by 60% by 2050, and has set a target of drawing 10% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010. Few believe those targets will be reached.</p> <p>\"It is easy to state massive targets, but you won't reach them just pointing at the sky,\" says Mr Shopley, who believes the government is \"trying to shove things down the pipe\" to an unreceptive audience. </p> <p>As for Paul and Laura, they are more than receptive to Future Forests' message. In asking for trees as a wedding present, they said: \"They'll help protect the environment for future generations, and are far more handsome than a toaster.\"</p>",
  "<p>One morning last month, when I was in America attending the Democratic convention in Boston, I stole away from politics and the noisy city and drove the short distance out to the solitude of the woods surrounding Walden Pond. </p> <p>Some readers, especially if they are Americans, will immediately know where this column is heading. Many other readers, especially if they are British, may not. For surprisingly few people in this country now seem to read the works of Henry David Thoreau, whose Walden was first published 150 years ago this month and has rarely been out of print since. </p> <p>A few books have had the capacity to change the way that people look at the world. It has been striking to read on the Guardian letters page recently, how fervently so many feel this way about Robert Tressell's The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. It is not a view I share. For me, Tressell's so-called socialist novel is one of the most over-rated books on the shelves. </p> <p>Walden, on the other hand, first did the trick for me when I was a student and continues to work an effect whenever I return to it. No book asks us more insistently to think about ourselves and to examine our claims to be free creatures. I am certainly not alone in my admiration for it. Thoreau's reflection on his solitary two years living on the shores of Walden Pond was a book that once captured the imagination of Tolstoy and of Gandhi. He is still one of the icons of the environmentalist movement. And he remains one of the necessary reference points for all those who, however intermittently and imperfectly, ask themselves the question: How should life be lived? </p> <p>This was indeed the question that took Thoreau to Walden Pond in March 1845 from his nearby home in historic Concord - a town that also numbered Emerson, Hawthorne and Alcott among its inhabitants and can thus boast comfortably the most concentrated literary associations in the United States. \"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,\" Thoreau wrote in one of Walden's most celebrated passages, \"to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\" </p> <p>He proceeded to do the thing for which he is now remembered. Borrowing an axe, Thoreau began to cut down some white pine on the shores of Walden Pond, before the winter ice had melted in the cove that now bears his name. By the early summer, he had built himself a small hut, and on Independence Day 1845 - nice touch that - he moved in. For the next two and a bit years he was to live there alone, tending for himself, observing, listening, thinking and chronicling, until he emerged from the woods to rejoin the world in September 1847. </p> <p>It was truly a back-to-nature, return-to-the-simple-life experiment. But Thoreau did not live as a hermit, and you only need to visit Walden Pond to grasp that, even then, such a thing was not really practicable. Even in the 1840s, the lake and the woods that surround it were hardly in the back of beyond. Sometimes, Thoreau would walk into town - Concord is not far distant - and at other times friends would come to the woods to seek him out. Throughout his sojourn, Thoreau could hear not just the call of the loon and the owl, or the shuffling of the woodchuck, but, as he describes, the more workaday noises of a railway that ran close by. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, Thoreau loved the natural world that he describes so beautifully. But he should not be seen as some misty-eyed 19th-century new-age shaman, mumbling and chanting about the wonder of creation or how everything is connected. His real subject is not nature but the life of human beings. It might be more illuminating to see Walden as a high-minded Victorian forerunner of a reality TV endurance trial, like Survivor or I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. </p> <p>The book in which he details his experience is gratifyingly impossible to pigeonhole. Walden is part diary, part natural history, part philosophical treatise. One of his friends dubbed Thoreau a \"poet-naturalist\", but he was also a historian, an economist, a reporter and - above all - a rebel. Prudish, austere and stubborn Thoreau may well have been, but Walden is really the original alternative manifesto. The critic Brooks Atkinson described it as \"the practical philosophy of a rebellion against the world's cowardly habits of living\". </p> <p>In the 60s, when I first read Walden, Thoreau was sometimes dubbed the world's first dropout. It might be more accurate, these days, to regard him as the godfather of the gap year. But the real point about Thoreau, and particularly about Walden, is that he challenges us to take life seriously, to look difficult choices in the face and to try to lead a grounded and integrated life. </p> <p>Which is why, I think, Walden is a book for all time, and in some ways why it is a book especially for ours. Thoreau thought life in the 1840s was intolerably false and pressured. That is why he went out to discover what mattered to him in his hut by Walden Pond. But what on earth would the man who wrote about \"this restless, nervous, bustling, trivial 19th century\" have found to say about the 21st, so much more restless, so much more nervous, so much more bustling and so very much more trivial? </p> <p>\"Why should we be in such a desperate haste to succeed,\" is how Thoreau puts it, \"and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his compan ions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\" </p> <p>Even to spend a couple of hours by Walden Pond, with the mighty modern city, its materialism and its noise just 20 minutes away down the turnpike, is to grasp something of the message of the book that Thoreau drafted here. It is to be reminded of how easy it is to be carried along unthinkingly by modern life, and at what cost, without asking the questions one should always ask and without taking responsibility for that failure. To read Thoreau is to learn a little humility. </p> <p>\"How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book?\" Thoreau writes. Reading The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists obviously has that effect for some. I just wish that such readers would face the fact that people who believed what Tressell believed spent much of the 20th century murdering millions of people and enslaving countless millions of others in a system which did not work. </p> <p>I'm not sure that Thoreau has the answers to all of life's mystery and complexity either. But I know few writers who speak more plainly about the shortcomings of modern hedonism and materialism. What is more, I do not think that anyone has ever murdered a single person in the name of the worldview that Thoreau expounded. And, frankly, that's good enough for me. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "British travellers who overstay in the US by a few days will no longer be searched, handcuffed, detained and put on the first plane back home if they return, the commissioner of the American department of homeland security said. <p>Stories of the harsh treatment meted out to British visitors who stayed beyond the 90 days allowed without a visa had given a \"black eye\" to America's reputation, said Robert Bonner, who heads the department's customs and border protection bureau. </p> <p>\"The consequences were grossly disproportionate to the minor, technical violations,\" he told the New York Times. \"Typically these individuals were handcuffed during the time they were transported to and from detention. They were treated as criminals.\" </p> <p>British visitors to the US, like those from 26 other states including Germany and Japan, can visit the US for 90 days without a visa. In the past when those who had stayed longer than that tried to re-enter the country they were handcuffed, locked up, often overnight, and then sent back. </p> <p>While the decision affects all 27 countries it appears that news reports in Britain prompted the change as the US believed it was tarnishing its image abroad. </p> <p>Mr Bonner said: \"If the person doesn't pose any threat to us whatsoever we want to find a way to let that person in. We can make judgments and exercise discretion to do something other than deny entry for minor technical violations of the immigration law and still do our priority mission, and that is preventing terrorists from entering the US.\" </p> <p>The new policy means previous transgressors will be permitted to enter the country for 90 days despite their history, but have to apply for visas after that. </p> <p>Officials do not know how many people were detained under the previous policy but conceded it was a significant number. </p> <p>Earlier this year a British man told of the harsh conditions he was held in after customs officials at New York's Kennedy airport detained him on suspicion of defaulting on a debt in the Middle East. </p> <p>David Pattison, 52, of Beeston in Norfolk, said he was subjected to \"inhumane and degrading\" treatment as he was detained with eight others, including two Britons. </p> <p>The accountant said he was handcuffed and a restraint was placed across his chest by abusive guards. He claimed he was denied food or drink and his angina medication was taken away from him. He denied that he owed money in the Gulf state of Qatar. </p> <p>In another case Magnus Mulliner, the deputy head of sports and recreation at a college in Southampton, said he was refused entry to the US at JFK in 2002 after immigration officials told him his name was linked to narcotics offences, which he denied. </p> <p>British embassy officials in Washington yesterday welcomed the move, saying they hoped the decision would \"result in a decline in the number of British citizens detained on arrival\".</p>",
  "Most bicycle thieves are content with simply cutting off the lock. They certainly don't use a horse for the getaway and drag half your house with them. <p>But Edward Genochio, 27, who is on the final leg of a 12,000-mile cycle ride from the UK to China, fell victim to no ordinary bike felon. </p> <p>The freelance web designer from Exeter was asleep when a Mongolian horseman tied a rope to his machine, which was locked to his tent, and rode off with the lot. </p> <p>\"It was a rude awakening to say the least,\" Mr Genochio said from Ulan Bator yesterday. \"Before going to sleep on Saturday night I had locked my bicycle to my tent.

Suddenly to lose them both leaves me feeling completely hollowed out,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Locals I have spoken to say they understand the feeling. It's the equivalent of a Mongo lian nomad losing his yurt and his horse. </p> <p>\"This thief really has thrown a spanner in the spokes, but having already come so far I'm not going to give up now.\" </p> <p>Mr Genochio had been waiting in Ulan Bator for a Chinese visa so he could finish his ride via a new route across the Gobi. </p> <p>He has already passed through France, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, European Russia and Siberia. </p> <p>Hazards have included a pair of motorcycle-mounted muggers who damaged his bike by ramming it while chasing him and demanding money.</p>"
