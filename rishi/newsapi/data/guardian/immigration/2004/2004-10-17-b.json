  "<p>It used to be an insane asylum called Bedlam, until 1930. The impressive Victorian building near London Bridge is now home to the Imperial War Museum, a memorial to the great conflicts of the 20th century, and to the experiences of those who were caught up in them. Exhibitions are regularly held there, but organising them is a complex operation. </p> <p>One of the current exhibitions is \"The Great Escape\" which shows how Allied prisoners of war coped with their incarceration and tells the story of some of the amazing escape attempts which they engineered from Stalag Luft 3 and Colditz. </p> <p>Penny Ritchie-Calder, head of exhibitions, says that they \"fast-tracked\" this particular exhibition in 10 months. Others can take as long as three years to come to fruition. \"This one began with a suggestion that we should mark the 60th anniversary of the great escape in a way which would appeal to all ages,\" says Ritchie-Calder. \"Escape is a great subject for children, provided it is treated in the right way. The idea was developed at a meeting between myself, Nigel Steel [chief historian], and the head of our public services division. There was a lot of discussion and planning done to see if it was viable.\" The discussions dealt not only with the content of the event but with how it was to be interpreted and displayed. \"In that sense, it is like a 3D story,\" she says. \"So we work with designers and brief them on the kinds of things we want to include.\" </p> <p>Sometimes, this can present problems. In this instance, it was the desire to use a replica of the Colditz glider the men built secretly in the camp and used in one of their bids for freedom. \"It would have taken up a lot of space, so the designers looked at how the POWs had constructed it in a small attic, which gave us the inspiration to squeeze ours into a similar space.\" </p> <p>When the plans for the exhibition are finalised, Nigel Steel, the museum's chief historian, gets to work. \"From previous work I've done in this area, I had a certain knowledge, but this was more specific,\" he says. \"I not only have to track down artefacts, but also background information for the exhibition texts and captions. I also traced veterans involved in escape attempts. This meant getting in touch with people like \"Jimmy\" James, one of the 76 who escaped via the tunnel in Stalag Luft 3, although 50 of the escapees were shot.\" James's account of the escape is kept at the museum and the man himself has been asked to give a lecture while the exhibition is on. </p> <p>For Steel, the National Archives at Kew, where they house briefs, papers, reports and case histories, were a vital resource. \"There is a huge amount of detail there, including papers relating to the war crimes trials that took place after the war when those who had killed the 50 escapees were tracked down.\" </p> <p>However, paper research cannot always suffice. So Steel flew to Poland to try and arrange for artefacts to be brought to London. While he was there, he took the opportunity to visit Colditz. \"What I really wanted to get across to the public was not just the details of the escapes, which were only one aspect of POW life, but how their daily lives revolved around getting enough food, making clothes and so on,\" Steel explains. He also wanted to convey to the public and children just how some of the ingenious plans - the famous Wooden Horse - were thought up and all the unsung preparation that was needed, like making compasses, maps and securing fake passports. </p> <p>The work, of course, does not end when the exhibits are brought together. The event then has to be brought to the attention of the public, press and media. This is where Rebecca Stephens enters the picture, as head of marketing and PR. \"I do get involved in discussions with Penny at the planning stage, because they want to know whether the project is marketable,\" she says. \"Obviously, this one is. So I read around the subject and discuss historical background with Nigel. The department I head has to identify our audience and work out all the promotional material. The exhibition title and branding are crucial. There also has to be a website to give people more information about the stories and exhibits on display.\" They also prepare biographies of the surviving veterans, and see if any of their individual stories can be used to promote the event in the press. As the opening approaches, Stephens also arranges for veterans to give interviews to the press and various radio and television programmes. </p> <p>An important feature of the exhibition is a replica Steve McQueen motorbike, used in the movie, The Great Escape. It is the first thing seen by visitors. But in fact, says Ritchie-Calder, \"the bike is a complete fiction which McQueen wanted to use in the film. So it was Hollywood working in its best interests. But it represents the whole mythology that has grown up around the subject of escape and is forever associated with the great escape in everyone's minds. But everything else in the exhibition is for real.\" </p> <p>Whilst this exhibition is now up and running, the team have been working on three more projects simultaneously. One might be tempted to quote the office cliche \"You don't have to be mad to work here, but it helps\" were it not for the fact that everything at the Imperial War Museum runs with almost military precision. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Great Escape is at the Imperial War Museum until the end of July, 2005.</p>",
  "The deal isn't with Miramax, the money isn't seven figures. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't the star and the book is nearly 30 years old. <p>All the same, Madeleine Masson seems certain of her place in Guinness World Records. At the age of 92, Mrs Masson, a grandmother, has just sold the film rights of her book. </p> <p>There is nothing grandmotherly about the book. It is a spy story - a scrupulously authenticated tale of espionage, wartime resistance and heroic feminine derring-do entitled Christine: The Search for Christine Granville. </p> <p>It tells of events 60 years ago during the second world war. Mrs Masson, who lives in Bosham, West Sussex, published it nearly 30 years ago. But it stirred the blood of a small Canadian film company, Queen Fine Arts, enough for it to sign a deal to pay \u00a357,000 for the film rights. </p> <p>The company chairman, Bernard Poulin, a Montreal businessman, flew to Britain to meet the astonished and delighted Englishwoman. With him came the Polish actress who will play her heroine, Liliana Komorowska, whose films include The Assignment. </p> <p>Mrs Masson said: \"It's wonderful - quite a surprise. I thought if it ever happened it would be after my death.\" </p> <p>Yesterday Guinness World Records said: \"We have no one that old listed as selling film rights. We would need to verify it, but it could definitely be a record. This is something we are very interested in.\" </p> <p>Mrs Masson has already received \u00a37,000. Under a contract checked by her lawyers, she will receive a further \u00a350,000 whether or not the film is completed. Queen Fine Arts is a small company said to be largely financed by Mr Poulin, a prominent Canadian businessman. </p> <p>Mrs Masson's biggest joy is that the film will throw renewed limelight on her adored heroine. Christine Granville, who was Polish-born, was awarded the George Medal, OBE and Croix de Guerre for her outstanding bravery working as an allied spy in Poland, Hungary and France. </p> <p>\"She had more ribbons than a general,\" Mrs Masson said. \"She exuded a kind of extraordinary magic - something that set her apart from every other person I've ever met. There was some magnetic force emanating from her.\" </p> <p>In the annals of European resistance, Granville is known as Churchill's favourite spy because her information about a Nazi tank build-up on the Russian border supposedly enabled the war leader to warn his Soviet counterpart, Stalin, of an impending attack. </p> <p>She is also reputed to have had a postwar affair with the James Bond author and intelligence officer, Ian Fleming. But Mrs Masson said she knew of no evidence for this. </p> <p>Granville became a British agent of the Special Operations Executive after leaving Poland when it fell to the Germans. </p> <p>She went to Budapest where she met a fellow Pole, Andrew Kowarski-Kennedy, who became her lover. The couple organised the escape of British and Polish prisoners of war. Christine risked her life to return to Poland three times, having to ski through mountain passes to re-enter her homeland. </p> <p>When she was eventually forced to leave Hungary with Kowarski-Kennedy, she hid in the boot of an ambassador's car as the safest way for her to cross the border. </p> <p>She was the first woman to be dropped by parachute into France from Algiers when she landed in the south-east of the country in 1944. On the many occasions she was dropped into France she helped to distribute food and pass on messages. </p> <p>This part of the story has echoes of the Sebastian Faulks novel Charlotte Gray, which was recently made into a film starring Cate Blanchett. </p> <p>After the war Granville was demobilised, given \u00a3100 and ended up working as a stewardess on a passenger liner. Here she met Mrs Masson, a passenger who had spent a year working in the French resistance, and told her story. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards she was murdered in London by a porter who became obsessed with her. Determined to perpetuate her achievements, Mrs Masson, with her own resistance credentials, was able to persuade SOE veterans, notably Kowarski-Kennedy, to talk to her. Her book, published in 1975, is one of 30 she has written, including a biography of Lady Mountbatten. </p> <p>She said: \"It is very important to protect Christine's memory. Christine was the living emblem of courage. The spectacular virtues of those people who gave their lives for freedom on a daily basis must be honoured.\"</p>",

Now he's moved to Five, he's keen to persuade her to keep offering such projects to him - and not to Channel 4's Kevin Lygo.

He is normally scrupulous about declaring an interest in his Spectator column whenever discussing a potential competitor. So it was intriguing to see the putative paper's deputy editor, Francis Wheen, making an appearance at an ICA debate last week, in which he confirmed that the project was still alive. Well, not dead, anyway. Wheen, who was in the audience for a debate on the future of newspapers, was spotted by the chair, Financial Times journalist John Lloyd, and asked to say whether the paper - The World - had, er, a future. Wheen, who was accompanied by the paper's commercial guru, Vicky Unwin, stood up and confirmed that the paper was, indeed, still trying to raise money.

  "<p>Confectionery advertising on television shows no sign of relenting as the junk food industry comes under scrutiny like never before. The confectionery market is worth \u00a35.9bn a year, according to the latest figures. </p> <p>Only one of the most-advertised products in the last month, Chupa Chups lollies, predominantly features a youngster - a boy stealing an ice cream from a lady. It closes with an assurance that the lollies are \"scientifically tooth friendly\" - a nod in the direction of health issues.

  "<p>Until very recently, BBC Radio had a department called Talks and - with the exception of AJP Taylor's improvised historical orations - the lecture has always seemed a more natural form for the wireless than for television. Yet this week sees the beginning of two major historical series which are essentially illustrated talks. </p> <p>In Monarchy, Dr David Starkey begins a four-year, 20-part examination of what this country's kings and queens have contributed to our our definitions of democracy and nationhood and, in his three-parter The Power of Nightmares, producer Adam Curtis examines what he sees as the fear-mongering of the Bush and Blair administrations. </p> <p>And, viewed together, these series offer a tempting thesis to a lecturer on television because they embody the two main possible styles of factual documentary: presenter-led and producer-driven. Starkey is rarely off screen; Curtis is never seen. </p> <p>The Power of Nightmares follows the style of previous Curtis series including The Century of the Self and Pandora's Box: an artful collage of archive footage - much of it obscure in origin but re-used with lethal point - is intercut with expert interviewees and overlaid with a voiceover commentary from the director that combines history, philosophy and political theory. </p> <p>In this project, Curtis advances the argument that politicians of the past prospered by promising dreams but that leaders these days thrive by highlighting the nightmares from which they will protect the public. This thesis is slightly tendentious - Churchill and Roosevelt were surely chosen by voters to manage military or economic nightmares - but Curtis goes on to make an even bolder claim: suggesting that the terrorist menace invoked by Bush and Blair is largely fictional. </p> <p>The riskiness of this proposition can be measured by the fact that this series would be very hard to screen in New York, Bali, Russia or Madrid, and there are possible circumstances in which it would have to be pulled from the schedules in Britain. </p> <p>But, if the political position of the films feels over-simplified, Curtis's presentation of his evidence is complex and challenging. He begins, quite unexpectedly, in the middle of the last century with two political philosophers: Sayyid Qutb in Egypt and Leo Strauss in America. Both, he explains, believed that liberalism was weakening the moral certainties of the societies in which they lived. </p> <p>Knowing that the Bush administration is full of neo-Straussians - including Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz - I guessed half the pay-off but not the rest, which is that Qutb's views became a leading influence on Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Therefore, as Curtis presents it, \"the war on terror\" is being fought between a government and an organisation rooted in a similar hatred of liberal pluralism, who both encourage support by raising fears of invasion and immigration. </p> <p>My own view is that Curtis under-estimates the reality of the terrorist threat, but his programmes are bloody clever stuff: full of ingenious parallels (the American neo-cons are shown to have exaggerated the Soviets' possession of \"weapons of mass destruction\") and startling archive footage including Egyptian television adverts. </p> <p>If Curtis had written up The Power of Nightmares as a fat hardback, he would have sold several million copies and received a chair at a liberal American university, but those who seek intelligent and provocative television should be glad that he chose to do it on the box. </p> <p>Intriguingly, Dr Starkey's Monarchy also begins with a bold contemporary parallel. Over shots of Bush and Blair appearing imperial, the historian explains that a modern democratic leader is \"a king for the time being\", his power as absolute as any early monarch's, and so the story of Alfred the Great has relevance to what happened in Iraq. </p> <p>Recent events have made us a nation of political commentators and Starkey clearly wants to have his shot, but his series is a satisfying enough meal without this contemporary garnish. You can, though, see why Starkey wanted to bring in Bush and Blair, because one of his gifts as a historian is for intelligent contemporary parallels and sharp use of jargon. King Ethelbert was \"inviting Augustine to market-test Christianity\". The Saxon conquest of Britain was \"ethnic cleansing at its most effective\": 200,000 new immigrants swamped a population of two million. </p> <p>Starkey's other talent is the natural attack of his personality. In tortoiseshell glasses that give him a disconcerting resemblance to Dame Edna Everage, he delivers his theories in such torrential monologues that you sometimes have to wind back to grasp an idea. But no one is going to complain about that at a time when viewers are fast-forwarding Alan Titchmarsh's ghastly The British Isles - A Natural History in the forlorn hope of finding one intelligent thought. </p> <p>Just as Titch prompts critics to call for a coroner's inquest on historical documentary, these two starkly different but equally intelligent examples prove that the genre is alive. </p> <p><strong>The reel deal</strong></p> <p>In Mark Chappell's sitcom My Life in Film, the life of the central character, aspiring film-maker Art (Kris Marshall), is a portmanteau movie or a multiplex. Each episode has the style of a different film: when Art takes an intensive driving course, the events take on the shape of Top Gun as he competes with a star parallel-parker for the heart of the sexy instructress. Attendance at a friend's marriage becomes an elaborate parody of Four Weddings and a Funeral. </p> <p>The basic joke is to substitute British banality for Hollywood pomposity: in the Top Gun programme, a show-down between the alpha males takes the form of a table-tennis game. The cleverness of the device is that - as in the first series of Alan Partridge before we saw any domestic moments - the personality of the central character is revealed entirely within the satire. Even the scenes featuring Art at home are movie parodies: an episode confined entirely to his flat is played as a spoof of Rear Window. </p> <p>Although almost every shot and line of dialogue is borrowed from somewhere else, My Life in Film manages, paradoxically, to feel original.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Monarchy, Monday, 9pm, Channel 4; The Power of Nightmares, Wednesday, 9pm, BBC2; My Life in Film, Tuesday, 9.30pm, BBC3</p>",

  "<p>The afternoon sun moves slowly across a cobalt blue Caribbean sky. With a gentle whir the circular sun pod you are reclining on rotates imperceptibly to catch the last rays. You reach for your laptop and with a click of the mouse a computer-generated voice starts reading your favourite blockbuster novel. No sooner has the thought that your shoulders might be burning crossed your mind than Ralph, your personal tanning butler, appears with an arsenal of sunscreens tucked into a holster around the waist of his designer trunks and offers to rub them in for you. </p> <p>This is not some Barbarella-style vision of the future but the face of luxury travel in 2004. </p> <p>Where once a mini-bar and a chocolate on the pillow were considered the height of luxury, today's five-star hotels are going to greater lengths to give their guests the ultimate pampering experience. From dedicated butlers to wireless internet access by the pool, nothing, it seems, is too much trouble. </p> <p>But in their quest to move with the times and trump the competition, have these pleasure palaces lost sight of what their guests really want? Is the new face of luxury a rotating sun lounger? </p> <p>The designers of the Palms Resort obviously think so. Guests at the lavish new hotel due to open in the Turks &amp; Caicos in January can work on their tan on the pods (though word is that they are encountering a few technical hitches), and listen to their favourite tunes on a complimentary iPod whilst lounging next to the $1.8m infinity pool. When they tire of that they can head off to the spa for a 'Mother of Pearl' exfoliation using crushed native queen conch shells. </p> <p>Over the top? This is positively restrained compared with the orgy of opulence on offer at the Emirates Palace which opens in December in Abu Dhabi. Already designated as a 'national monument', the hotel will combine old- style embellishments (gold-encrusted domes, mosaics, spiral staircases and water features) with new-style frills such as wireless internet access around the swimming pool and on the beach, enabling guests - should they temporarily take leave of their senses - to take their laptop to the beach, download their favourite book and read it on screen. </p> <p>Someone, somewhere (possibly the same person who came up with the idea of the sun pod) has decided that this is easier than packing a paperback. </p> <p>And herein lies the problem with the new generation of 'super luxury' hotels: once you have taken care of the basics - good service, good location, good food - too many of the so-called extras actually detract from the experience: culprits include porters who insist on relieving you of your bags the second you walk through the door, only to leave you waiting for the next 20 minutes for them to be brought to your room; turn-down services which always arrive just as you are getting into the shower; the man in the golf buggy who insists on trundling you the 50 yards from reception to the car park at two miles per hour. </p> <p>Higher levels of disposable income mean that more people than ever can afford to take the kind of holidays that once only rock stars, criminals and members of the aristocracy could enjoy. </p> <p>Longhaul tour operator Kuoni has seen its luxury business triple, with five-star hotels accounting for 20 per cent of all bookings. To cater for the increased prosperity of its clients, the company introduced private jet charter for the first time this year. 'This would have been unthinkable even five years ago but private jets are no longer the domain of the rich and famous,' said managing director Sue Biggs. 'People are using their money to buy time, which is now the greatest luxury of all. </p> <p>'In the 1980s our clients used to be lords and ladies but today they are just as likely to be high-flying city workers or honeymooners.' </p> <p>One of the upshots of this 'democratisation' of luxury is that the goal posts have had to move. As the middle classes start to encroach on the territory of the super-rich, luxury hoteliers have to raise the bar that little bit higher to pander to the elite - hence the recent flurry of six and even seven-star hotels and cruise ships. </p> <p>The Queen, Sir Elton John and Naomi Campbell aside, how many of us are actually comfortable with this level of cosseting? The latest fad is for hotels to offer personal butlers. Long believed to be a dying species, the butler is enjoying a spectacular new lease of life at luxury hotels across the globe. There are no less than 58 of them at the recently-opened Thalassa hotel in Cyprus - one for each room. Your very own Jeeves will will meet you at the airport with champagne, a cold towel and a limo, unpack for you, scatter rose petals on your bed and generally pander to your every whim. Which is fine if you are ok with the idea of somebody else running your bath or handling your smalls but most of us would find this level of attention intrusive. </p> <p>On a recent visit to the Elephant Corridor Hotel - billed as Sri Lanka's finest - a white-gloved young man came into my room every evening (usually as I was getting into the shower) and painstakingly spelt out Good Night in rose petals on my bed, while I waited in the bathroom for him to finish. His pained expression when I explained to him that I'd really rather he didn't, still haunts me to this day. </p> <p>As our survey of seasoned travellers shows, luxury has many definitions: space, time, privacy, good service. Nobody, but nobody, defines it as a hot chocolate sommelier. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Packages to the Palms Resort in the Turks and Caicos and the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi are available with ITC Classics (01244 355400; <a href=\"http://www.itcclassics.co.uk\">www.itcclassics.co.uk</a>) </p> <p><strong>Coming soon to a hotel near you</strong> </p> <p><strong> The bath butler</strong><br> Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel (<a href=\"http://www.thebalmoralhotel.com\">www.thebalmoralhotel.com</a>) introduced the services of a bath butler this summer, who will run your bath and add your choice of bubbles.

  "<p><strong> Lynn Barber</strong> <br> Observer writer </p> <p>Space is my idea of the ultimate luxury - I want a vast room, vast bed, vast bath and not much more in the way of extras. I hate chocolates on the pillow, and bedspreads so complicated they need a team of maids to remove them. </p> <p>Sandy Lane in Barbados gets it right - truly friendly, confident, happy staff who cater for your eccentricities rather than deriding them. They noticed that I liked to go swimming on the beach at dawn, before the beach boys came on duty, and showed me where they would hide a beach towel for me overnight. English hotels would just put up a notice saying: No swimming before 9am. </p> <p>The worst luxury I ever encountered was the 'bath butler' at the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore. He grilled me for about 20 minutes on whether I wanted a stimulating bath or a relaxing one, herbal or floral, whether my skin was dry or oily. Actually I was just travel-stained and wanted to get clean! </p> <p><strong> Ruth Watson</strong><br> Owner of the Crown and Castle, Orford, Suffolk </p> <p> I can't be doing with meaningless luxury - DVDs, 85 cushions littering the room, chocolates on pillows... Real luxury is space, silence (especially at night - death to all rooms near extractor fans, delivery entrances and bin collection areas), good beds and fine cotton bed linen (changed daily) and plumbing that works (quietly). If a turn-down service means the chambermaid knocking on the door sometime between 7 and 8pm, when you're washing/half-dressed/panicking about being ready in time, then it's not a luxury. </p> <p>Genuine luxury is when the staff treat you with real care, not just hollow gestures. Room service breakfast that arrives on time, with proper freshly squeezed orange juice and eggs that are cooked exactly as you've asked - and all the cutlery and napkins that you need. </p> <p>The most luxurious hotels I have stayed in are all in the Far East where the service is sensational, particularly the Amankila in Bali which is beautiful beyond belief. </p> <p><strong>Alain de Botton</strong> <br>Philosopher and author of The Art of Travel </p> <p> Hotel managers' ideas of luxury are very bizarre. They're so over the top, something like what Louis XIV might have enjoyed. But actually for most of us, what luxury means is something comfortable and undepressing. It's a pity that more hotels aren't just decent and undepressing and clean. That's true luxury for me. Instead, in Britain at least, we seem to have squalor on the one hand and absurd baroque conceptions of luxury on the other: reflecting a typical British inability to inhabit the middle ground. </p> <p><strong>Herbert Ypma</strong><br>Author of the Hip Hotel guides </p> <p>The idea of luxury depends on the context - it's very different in a city than when you're on an 'escape'. A definite trend on the escape side is paying more and getting less. At the Hotelito Desconicido in Mexico, you get a little thatched house with no electricity, no phone. What you do get is an amazing location, extraordinary decoration, a rediscovery of your sense of adventure. </p> <p>In a city, it's a luxury to have a sense of space, something simple like a bathroom with daylight. It sounds simple but so many are like little caves. </p> <p>Somewhere that really got it wrong is the Fullerton Hotel in Singapore - there was a great deal of fanfare about the fact that they'd acquired the last remaining colonial building, the old Post Office. It could have been great, with lots of links to the colonial era, but instead they knocked everything out, built a steel box inside and filled it with gold, black and beige. And the killer for me is that they served afternoon tea. It's typical of the whole naff idea of luxury - bombarding people with 35 fluffy towels and not paying attention to the fact that the bathroom is a little box with no light or ventilation. </p> <p><strong>Mariella Frostrup</strong><br>TV presenter and Observer columnist </p> <p> My idea of luxury is having every whim catered for, without a hint of subservience and not having to dress up or, preferably, wear shoes. As a result, Sandy Lane in Barbados is out and Benguerra Lodge, Mozambique, Banyan Tree, Maldives, and Delphi Spa, Co Mayo, are firm favourites. Although at Delphi you do have to wear Wellington boots quite often! </p> <p><strong>Stelios Haji-Ioannou</strong><br>Founder and chairman of Easygroup </p> <p>Hotels need to offer a customised service - they have to be fit for a purpose. My idea of what an urban hotel should be, where you're staying just one night, is that you don't need lots of space - you'll be paying for the real estate. All you need is a bed, a bathroom and a bit of space to get in. Other services are within walking distance so there's no point offering them in the hotel. I appreciate good service at a reasonable price - they've got this right at Raffles in Singapore, where someone will always come quickly when you want something. But they have a ratio of staff to customers that is unsustainable by Western standards: low-cost staff. I'm not comfortable in very glitzy places with Louis XV furniture - it's out of character for me. And I prefer hard pillows to soft ones. </p> <p><strong>Johnny Ekperigin </strong> <br>Group managing partner, Portobello Hotel </p> <p>I don't like the term 'luxury' - I prefer the idea of 'comfortable' and 'still at home'. Luxury is more about not being able to touch anything, not tread on the beautiful white carpet or mess up the bed. </p> <p>At the Portobello we might put the bath next to the bed - that's extravagance. Your friend can lie on the bed while you're in the bath, and you can talk to each other. You're supposed to feel you can throw yourself around the room. Our guests certainly do that. </p> <p>Somewhere that's got it wrong is the Hempel in London. You can't touch anything, or sit down anywhere. It's just made to look at, not to live in. </p> <p><strong>Ken McCulloch</strong><br> Founder of the Malmaison group, owner of Dakota hotels and the Columbus in Monaco </p> <p> The definition of luxury is changing - now it's about creating calmness. It's very important because people are going at such a rate that the last thing they want in a hotel is hassle. It's about people thinking for you so you don't have to ask for everything. </p> <p>One place that really got it right was The Point, the former retreat of the Rockefeller family in the Adirondack Mountains in Upper New York State. It was quite wacky but you feel immediately at home. You had to pay for the hotel before they'd give you directions but there was the best of food, wine and service, and it was low key and done very well. </p> <p>In America they often get it wrong, though, giving you huge baskets of fruit, or a selection of books, when you're only staying for one night. It's a waste of money. Memorable places don't have to go over the top, just show they care. </p> <p><strong>Robert Cook</strong> <br>Chief executive of Malmaison and Hotel du Vin </p> <p>The days of the \u00a3250 grand old hotel have gone. People don't want silver, china and crystal. They're not interested in finding a chocolate on their bedside table or their robe folded beautifully at the end of the bed. </p> <p>I'm a great believer in cutting out the frills. We won't do turn down, or portelage (although there will be someone there to help carry your luggage if you need them to). People's lifestyles have changed - they want sexy, seductive spaces. They're more interested in edgy touches than the traditional frills. </p> <p><strong> Desmond Balmer</strong><br> Editor of the Good Hotel Guide </p> <p>This year the guide gave its London Luxury Hotel of the Year award to One Aldwych, Gordon Campbell Gray's sleek conversion of the old Morning Post offices. We have always liked the design; bedrooms with all the modern gizmos; the swimming pool with underwater music; the suites with private gyms. But what really impressed our inspectors was the impeccable service from an international young staff, who were well trained (and, significantly, better paid than in most London luxury hotels). </p> <p><strong> Alastair Sawday</strong><br> Publisher of Special Places to Stay </p> <p>A luxurious experience would be: arriving at the hotel on my bicycle, exhausted and wet, and being met by a warm receptionist with a big towel, followed by an invitation to settle into a Jacuzzi. A glass of wine would arrive - and eventually a masseur. Luxury should be aesthetic as well as physical. I can luxuriate in a garden with gorgeous views better than I can in a pillow-drowned bed with butlers at my elbow. </p> <p>I recently enjoyed a fabulous stay at the Rookery Hotel, near Smithfield market: quiet, unpompous, flagstoned and furnished with good antiques, refreshingly unelaborate without pandering to minimalism, handsome beds and roll-top baths, nice staff and the atmosphere of a country house - almost. </p> <p><strong>Forbes Mutch</strong><br> Group editor of Caterer and Hotelkeeper magazine. </p> <p>Personal service is what defines top quality hotels and I would cite Gleneagles in Scotland and Chewton Glen in Hampshire in the UK and the Shangri-La in Singapore as three of the best examples. At these hotels, you do feel that you're being looked after on a very personal level. </p> <p>When it comes to rotating sun beds and being issued with iPods on arrival, I guess some people would be turned on by that. There's always something new. If you go back 20 or 30 years, luxury hotels were boasting that they'd got trouser presses in the rooms. </p> <p>Hotels in the Far East provide luxury but they do have a massive staff resource. They even employ people whose only job it is to go around stamping the hotel's motif in the sand on the ashtray by the elevators.</p>",
  "The language of political hyperbole used by some alarmists to describe the threat of Islamist radicals resembles the language of totalitarianism. It does not describe an empirically observed reality. It describes and exaggerates something feared and imagined. It describes what can be called a virtual reality, more urgent, and, in the minds of its users, more real than the 'real' reality. <p>Paranoid projections based on enemy declarations and ignorant slogans have been the currency of presidential discourse in the United States. In Britain, too, the country's role in the war was justified by the Prime Minister with earnest moralism. Both the President and the Prime Minister cast the Islamic enemy as 'pure evil', motivated by 'hatred of freedom' and envy 'of our way of life', and which must be fought 'there' before it has to be fought on the streets of London, New York or in the placid suburbs of the United States. All this adds up to a false and grossly ideological conception of war between civilisations. </p> <p>This language also shapes the Islamic perception of what the West is doing. It affects the course of Islamic reform, tending to discredit forces of moderate, secular and progressive theological change as ineffectual. </p> <p>The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and events in Palestine, together with violence against Muslims elsewhere, are offering to Islamic society convincing, although ultimately false, evidence that a war against their civilisation is underway. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Muslims now fear that what is going on in the Gaza refugee camps and in Iraq is what, ultimately, may be in store for them. This already has had a ruinous effect on the movement of ideas and political reform between Western and Islamic societies. </p> <p>The intellectual godfather of modern Islamist radicalism is generally taken to have been the 20th-century Egyptian intellectual named Sayyid Qutb. A review of the literature on Islamic radicalism during the past 25 years (cited by John Zimmerman in the journal Terrorism and Political Violence ) shows Qutb routinely mentioned as one of the two most important intellectual influences on these movements and, in particular, as being the main (if indirect) inspiration for Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928 to oppose the secularising tendencies in Islamic society, influenced the Qutb tradition of religious revival and reform towards greater militancy and conservatism. </p> <p>Yet the most important reform movements in the Arab world before the Second World War were secular in character. A modernising and secular pan-Arab nationalism followed the First World War and gave rise to the Baath movement in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. Arab-Christian intellectuals were originally important in its development. They wanted an 'Arab nation' that was not exclusively Muslim. </p> <p>The most important effort to establish a secular pan-Arab 'nation' was that of Gamal Nasser in Egypt in the 1950s. This and the parallel 'Arab Socialist' movement were in part reactions to the shock of Israel's creation, and its defeat of the Arab armies in the 1948 war. </p> <p>These secular Arab movements failed. The depressing residue today of the Baath movement and of Arab socialism consists of hereditary Presidents for life and military dictators. </p> <p>Social and political reform has generally been more successful in monarchies whose legitimacy is ultimately religious, as in Morocco and Jordan. (Saudi Arabia's rulers are mere military usurpers of the Hashemite dynasty, hereditary protectors of the Holy Places.) </p> <p>The Ottoman Empire's survival until the First World War delayed the shock of foreign conquest on the Arab Middle East. In colonial Asia, a pattern of reaction was already evident, initially of resistance, then of accommodation or even conversion to Western ideas, producing an ideal - usually unattained - of synthesis with the West. </p> <p>Eventually, there were new forms of armed resistance, based on subversive ideas taken from the West: nationalism, and 20th-century national communism. Otherwise, there was the surviving idea of return to religion in order to find a new golden age. </p> <p>Today's militant Islamic revival has seemed a success because it is taken so seriously in the West. Al-Qaeda's attack on the United States have produced three years of frenzied and quasi-paranoid reaction by the American government. The rest of the world has been pushed to follow the American lead, convenient for many leaders with troublesome separatist or subversive minorities easily redefined as international terrorists. </p> <p>The Islamist movement itself evolved as a form of 'franchised' terrorism with a common ideological and inspirational base. It spread to aggrieved Muslims in Europe, Asia, Africa and the US. </p> <p>In reaction, the US, with allies, has invaded two countries (thus far) and overturned two governments. This has served chiefly to promote the Islamist message and recruit more militants. Iraq and Afghanistan today are the evidence of this. </p> <p>The new radical Islamism is a success in the moral and psychological damage it has inflicted on the United States and its allies. For the Islamic world it will inevitably prove still another failure. No great caliphate is going to be re-established. Even if all Islam were converted to the law of Sharia and the Taliban pattern of society, this would produce no great revival in terms relevant to the modern world. </p> <p>The quest for the lost golden age is a fool's mission. The peasant leader of the anti-Western T'ai P'ing uprising in 19th-century China, which killed mil lions, preached land distribution and egalitarianism, thought that he could produce a magical synthesis of Western and Eastern religion. He promised his followers a universal empire, but he was gone within a decade. </p> <p>The Indian Rebellion of 1857 - the 'Sepoy Mutiny' - which lasted for nearly two years, proclaimed a revival of the Moghul Empire when it reached Delhi. It was soon conquered, by mostly Indian forces. The great Boxer uprising in China in 1900 made its slogan 'Cherish the Dynasty - Exterminate the Foreigner!' The Empress indirectly encouraged it, but Western intervention crushed it. </p> <p>Osama bin Laden himself has gone from being the patron or financier of the Taliban movement to a fugitive existence in Waziristan. His followers may blow up Americans in the Green Zone of Baghdad. They can reinforce an Iraqi nationalism that will eventually force the US and its allies out of that country, to their humiliation. </p> <p>But as Gilles Kepel, the French authority on Islamic society, has already said, the Islamist movement is moribund in moral terms, although its military and political energy is not yet exhausted. There is no way in which it seriously threatens the Western industrial nations, other than through sporadic acts of terrorism. And that is the sort of thing Britain endured for many years from the IRA, Italy and Germany during the 1970s and 1980s from their Red Brigades, and Spain from Basque separatists. It is unpleasant, but it is not serious. (This is the lesson the American people refuse to understand.) </p> <p>The Islamist movement is a desperate effort by elements in a thwarted society to strike back at enemies. But it really wants only to expel the West and its influence from the Muslim world. It can't even do that. The Islamists want to conquer and convert Islamic society - not infidel society. </p> <p>Islamic fundamentalism has nothing to offer contemporary Islam. You cannot function in the 21st century on the basis of a primitive interpretation of Islamic law. That already is evident in Iran. Afghanistan under the Taliban had no future. The future of the Islamist movement itself is irrelevance. For the Islamic people, its legacy will be tragedy. </p> <p>William Pfaff is the author of two books on nationalism and the Western impact on the non-Western world: The Politics of Hysteria 1964, and The Wrath of Nations 1993. </p> <p>\u00a9 William Pfaff.

  "<p>Traditionally, young, blonde, ex-model Australian actresses who take their first faltering steps into the limelight via the medium of Neighbours do not end up as the darlings of the American indie scene. Pop stars? Quite possibly. Pantomime leads? Almost certainly. Embraced by the dark, edgy, Sundance-approved fringes of the movie industry? Absolutely not. Unless, it seems, they're Radha Mitchell. </p> <p>Despite looking like a younger Sharon Stone, giggling habitually like a tipsy coquette and having starred as two different characters in Australia's leading soap opera, over the last eight years Mitchell has established herself as a versatile and accomplished fixture on the moody art-house flick circuit. She launched her assault on the indie scene by 'cornering the market on the lesbian ingenue' - first as Danni in Emma-Kate Croghan's directorial debut Love and Other Catastrophes, then as Syd in Lisa Cholodenko's loudly acclaimed High Art. 'After that, I was offered lots of lesbian roles, but I didn't want them because I'd already played the best there was,' she says earnestly. And then she giggles. From then on, she majored in 'independent films, different roles', systematically demolishing the spectre of Neighbours. She wrote, directed and starred in a black-and-white movie called Four Reasons, and broke out into the mainstream a little playing Colin Farrell's wife in 2002's unnerving Phone Booth. </p> <p>Over the next few months, Mitchell will come as close as she's capable to being a ubiquitous presence in our multiplexes, appearing in three enormously different films, each of which is relatively high profile. She co-stars alongside Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet in Finding Neverland, a fictionalised version of how JM Barrie came to write Peter Pan (out later this month); opposite Denzel Washington in Man on Fire, a harrowing portrayal of the kidnapping industry in Mexico City (out now); and as both Melinda and Melinda in Woody Allen's new film, Melinda and Melinda (out in January). </p> <p>Is she prepared for the increased exposure? 'Um, not sure. I never wanted to be a movie star. I'd definitely rather be rich than famous.'</p> <p>She had, she thinks, the defining Woody Allen experience on the set of Melinda and Melinda. 'He doesn't like to rehearse. Most of the cast didn't have the script, they didn't even know who they were in the film. And I thought for the first two days: God, I'm fired, for sure I'm fired - because he wasn't talking to me, he was just saying: \"Action\" and \"Cut.\" And you hear all these stories about, like, actors go on set one day and then the next day they're gone and someone else is in there, playing their part. But then I realised he had a very casual attitude towards shooting. Like he'd ask us if we'd finished yet, because he wanted to go and have a bath. And then literally would go home after, like, two takes: \"No, you were great!\" That was the environment he was creating. That's what Woody Allen movies are about: anxiety, anticipation, uncertainty.'</p> <p>Mitchell grew up in Melbourne, in a family environment she'll only describe as 'very unusual. I think my parents see my life now as very conservative.' She won't elaborate, frustratingly. 'I don't feel like going there. It wasn't bad. I just had lots of experiences that sheltered children wouldn't have,' she's said in the past. Now, all she'll add is: 'My mum had a clothing store, and we'd go on trips to India for fabrics...' which isn't all that unconservative.</p> <p>Mitchell had no burning acting ambitions as a child. 'No. But I was certainly... enthusiastic. I had a friend, and we always used to pretend to be twins. We had this fantasy about going to Hollywood together. We were about four. But how did it all end up as it is now? Well, I think because I did Love and Other Catastrophes and then I realised that there was some kind of possibility there, and you don't waste it... Because in Australia there really isn't a lot to do. There aren't a lot of opportunities.'</p> <p>There was always, however, Neighbours. Is the soap mandatory for aspiring Australian actors? <br> 'It probably is,' Mitchell says. 'I think everybody should be subjected to it. It's incredibly boring.'<br> How awful is it?<br> 'The first two months I was on it, I had fun. I hadn't worked much, so when it came up, I was: \"Wow!\" And the guy who I had all my scenes with, he was about to get axed from the show, so he had a passion to stay on. So we were the only people ever in the history of Neighbours to rehearse.'</p> <p>Mitchell has lived in LA for seven years. There, she dips in and out of Australian expat society ('Sometimes I hang out with Naomi [Watts] and Heath [Ledger]. I don't really know Guy [Pearce]') and she may or may not have a boyfriend. 'That's too private. I'd rather talk about my bank balance.' She'd also rather talk about the pressure of plastic surgery. 'For Man on Fire the director rang me and asked if I was going to cut my mole off, if I wouldn't mind. I was really kind of put out. I suddenly found that I have this very strong attachment to my mole.'</p> <p>For her next project, Rahda Mitchell's contemplating more genre-subverting activities. 'I'm maybe going to be a vampire. Although they've said: You can't have a blonde vampire. The director said: Do you want to dye your hair? But I don't. I want to be a blonde vampire. Catherine Deneuve was a blonde vampire, and she was my favourite vampire ever.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Finding Neverland is out on 29 October</p>",
  "<p>I am after a crumbly, buttery crust to cover the last of this season's plums. One that will offer a crisp contrast to the sweetly melting fruit, yet will be tender enough for the juices to bubble up through it. I treasure these late fruits, knowing that there will be nothing more till next summer. The classic crumble of flour, butter and sugar is a fair starting place, but I have done that once already this week, to top a pudding basin full of dark, late Marjorie's Seedling. It's a chance to move the crumble up a notch.</p> <p>Plums, gages and apples respond to any form of nut, and almonds - ground, flaked or roughly chopped - work well in a crumble and add a moist richness to the crust. Walnuts tend to produce a dryness and a mealy taste when finely ground, though when they're added in pieces the size of large gravel, what was a plain crumble suddenly becomes invitingly crunchy. Ground or chopped hazelnuts are worth a try here, too. </p> <p>Crumble of any sort fills the kitchen with possibly the most reassuring smell on God's earth, but it is amplified when you add the sweet spices, cinnamon, clove (a very little) and nutmeg. It is worth a shake or two of ground cinnamon in the crumb crust for an apple pudding. Cardamom is one to use with apple, too. Hot fruit, crumb topping, warm spice. It sounds like we have all died and gone to heaven. </p> <p>I have a few recipes for a sweet crust that include fine breadcrumbs instead of flour. Instead of rubbing the butter into the flour, drizzle the crumbs with melted butter and sweeten with brown sugar. It is lighter than the traditional route, crisper and less rich. I'm not sure you can ever have too many ways of using up bread. </p> <p>The greengages have been around longer this year than usual. Last Sunday I made greengage crumble with an oat and almond top. The luxury of the ground almonds saved it from tasting like something from a health-food shop. Instead of oats, I could have tossed in some sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds, or maybe a handful of sesame. In the oven the oats toasted nuttily, and added a welcome crunch and chewiness. </p> <p>Sweetness matters when you are using tart fruit such as plums and cooking apples. I prefer to keep most of the sugar in the crust and sweeten the fruit as little as possible, adding a slice of butter or a little water if needs be. When it comes to gilding the lily, it is only something ice cold that really lifts a piping-hot crumble. It is that mouthful of blistering fruit and vanilla ice cream, double cream or creme fraiche on your spoon that makes this probably the best hot pudding in the world. </p> <p><strong>Oat plum crumble</strong></p> <p>It is the end of the plum season, though you will still find a few stragglers left (mostly Alex or Marjorie's Seedling). The late Italian ones are luscious too, if you give them a day or two at home to ripen. Serves 6.</p> <p><strong>650g plums<br>4 tbsp caster sugar<br>a knob of butter</strong></p> <p>For the crust:<strong><br> 150g plain flour<br>80g butter <br>50g ground almonds <br>70g demerara sugar <br>75g rolled oats</strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Make the oat crust by rubbing the butter into the flour till it resembles fresh breadcrumbs. Stir in the almonds, the demerara sugar and the oats. </p> <p>Pile the fruit into a buttered baking dish and add the sugar, butter and a few tablespoons of water. Tip the oat-and-almond topping on to the fruit and bake for 30-35 minutes till the crust is crisp and golden, the fruit soft. Serve hot, with cream. </p> <p><strong>Damson Almond crumble</strong></p> <p>I planned to bottle some damsons, but the fruit disappeared before I could. I did throw some in the freezer (it had never seen fruit before and couldn't believe its luck). Use apples if you prefer. Serves 6.</p> <p><strong>650-700g plums or damsons<br>4 tbsp caster sugar or more to taste <br>a thin slice of butter </strong></p> <p>For the crumble:<strong><br>150g plain flour <br>100g butter <br>50g ground almonds <br>75g caster or light brown sugar</strong></p> <p>Put the damsons in a shallow pan with the sugar and the butter and a tablespoon or two of water. Cook over a moderate heat until the juices start to flow from the damsons, probably about 5 minutes, depending on the ripeness of your fruit. Tip the fruit and the juice into a deep pie dish. </p> <p>Rub the butter, which should ideally be cold from the fridge, into the flour with your fingertips. When the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs, stir in the almonds and sugar. Sprinkle a tablespoon of water over the mixture and stir lightly with a fork. Some of the crumbs should stick together in small lumps - this gives a more interesting crumble.</p> <p>Scatter the crumble over the fruit, then bake in a preheated oven at 200C/gas mark 6 for about 35 minutes. The crumble is done when the crumbs are pale gold and some juice has, hopefully, soaked through the crust. Serve with thick golden cream. </p> <p><strong>Apple Crisp</strong></p> <p>A crisper, lighter crust. Serves 6.</p> <p><strong>1kg sharp apples, such as Bramley or Peasgood Nonsuch <br>a knife-point of cinnamon <br>125g soft white bread <br>75g light muscovado sugar <br>75g butter, melted </strong></p> <p>To serve: <br><strong>double cream</strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Peel and core the apples and cut them into thick slices. Drop the fruit into a buttered pudding basin or shallow casserole and toss very gently with the ground cinnamon. Please don't overdo the cinnamon - you only want the merest whiff. </p> <p>Whizz the bread to rough crumbs in a food processor. You don't want them to be too fine - more of a soft rubble than a fine sand. Mix the breadcrumbs and sugar and cover the apples loosely with them. Melt the butter in a small pan, then pour it over the crumbs, making certain to soak them all. Bake for 35 minutes, till the apples are soft and melting, and the crumbs golden and crisp.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year I wrote about the dry borders that we were making at home. They have been among the real successes of this summer and are still looking really good. The melianthus has never been in such fine fettle and the gauras, verbascums and Verbena bonariensis are flowering with the same enthusiasm they had in the high days of August. </p> <p>The verbena is a revelation, which, for such a familiar plant, takes some doing. We have always grown it in our Jewel garden, where it can look good at the front of the borders but gets rather lost further back. It is a plant to look through and round, so you make the most of its open airiness. For such a ubiquitous plant, we've had trouble with it over the past few years. Although nominally a hardy perennial, it rarely survives our winters, but self-seeds prodigiously and for a number of years we took it for granted as a gift, almost. </p> <p>But about four years ago that came to an abrupt halt and it only appeared in the paths and at the edges of the vegetable beds, along with rogue (but welcome) poppies, fennel, violas and foxgloves. Strange. Then I worked out that this coincided with our current regime of mulching deeply every spring. In the process we were mulching over verbena seedlings and seed, and blanketing out our summer harvest of V bonariensis flowers. The only seedlings that came through were the ones beyond the mulch layer in the paths and untended corners. So this year I carefully dug up all these mulch escapees and grew them on in pots before planting them out in the dry garden, where they will not be mulched by anything more light-excluding than gravel. I shall also take cuttings now and pot some up specifically for cutting material in the spring. Apparently, spring cuttings take very well and quickly mature into flowering, healthy plants. </p> <p>The various grasses have done well and we shall add to them, in particular two stipas, the pheasant grass, Stipa arundinacea, and the giant oat, Stipa gigantea. Pheasant grass is another plant that seeds itself prolifically but is undeterred by a mulch. One of the beds, which was made later, is planted almost entirely with pheasant grass, V bonariensis and sedums. The result is spectacular. I can take no credit for this, because it was simply a question of bunging in what we had to hand to buy us time to think about it properly at our leisure. But it has been an entirely happy bung, and especially for the sedums.</p> <p>Again, these have been growing for years in our Jewel garden, where they developed lush, fat leaves and stems so top heavy with flower that, by midsummer, they toppled and splayed like the spokes of a cartwheel. Sometimes we left them where they fell and other years supported them, but a fallen sedum never regains its dignity. They suffer from the same problem as our old Shetland pony, Charlie Farley. He grazed the end of the garden that is now orchard, and I used to divide it up into tiny units of ground grazed to raw earth. Any richer fare was too strong for him, although from time to time he would escape, eat frantically and get laminitis and suffer inevitable agony, poor boy. Eventually we gave him to the wife of a publican who used him as a decoy in her ongoing affair with a neighbouring farmer. It is a long story and has absolutely nothing to do with sedums. But, like poor old Charlie, they are happiest and healthiest when surviving off the poorest rations available. </p> <p>Sedum leaves have that swollen look that you see in cacti, and if you tear one in half, the milky surface reveals itself to be a thin skin covering a rich green felty sponge. This has evolved as a means of storing water and betrays their desiccated homelands. The smoothness of their leaves reduces transpiration, and even the stems, right to the point that they taper into the little starry flowerheads, have an inner-tubular smoothness. All this means that they are very good at retaining moisture and so will grow in poor, dry soil and prefer good - even sieve-like - drainage in any soil or situation. Most of the genus have adapted to grow clinging on to stony outcrops or in shale, where the bulk of annual moisture comes from snow which slips away as soon as it melts. So, sitting in the two or three inches of poor soil of our new beds, which in turn rest on solid rock, they are completely happy, if only half as tall as they grew previously. </p> <p>I planted the variegated Sedum alboroseum 'Mediovariegatum', which has bleached-out yellow interiors and a ragged stain of green around the edge. The florets are more lime-green than white, with very pale pink centres. </p> <p>S spectabile 'Ruby Glow' is good and low anyway, and ideal for the front of a bed, while S 'Sunset Cloud' has really good purple, almost chocolate, leaves and flowers. It is a hybrid from S 'Ruby Glow'. S 'Autumn Joy' might well be sold as 'Herbstfreude' and is one of the more vigorous varieties, and best for a late, intense display of deep red colour. It is more vigorous than most, and if the harsh diet of free-draining, poor soil still does not stop it flopping from the middle, try lifting and replanting it. The shock will produce shorter stems. </p> <p>I want to introduce some penstemons to this border, too. In fact, if you keep snapping off the spent flower stems, they can flower from July through to November. Penstemons, like sedums, thrive with sharp drainage and, like Verbena bonariensis, do not like our cold, wet winters and rarely make it through to spring. One way to help them through is to leave the top growth uncut to provide a layer of protection, which can then be tidied in spring. The best way to keep them going is from cuttings, which are exceptionally easy to take, although it's a trifle late for that now, as you need a healthy non-flowering tip. </p> <p>I am not so keen on the frilly pink colours that penstemons can produce, but love the deeper shades. Personally, I adore the plum tones in 'Garnet', 'Blackbird', 'Pensham Blackberry Ice', 'Midnight', 'Burgundy', 'Raven' and P whippleanus, and the purple stems of 'Russian River' or purple flowers of 'Papal Purple'. There are also some good reds, like 'Flame', 'Red Ace', 'Chester Scarlet', 'Pensham Raspberry Ice', 'Pensham Just Jayne', and P barbatus 'Coccineus'.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:monty.don@observer.co.uk\">monty.don@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Campaigners are calling for all pensioners' homes to be fitted with central heating after it was announced that more than 18,000 elderly people died last winter from cold-related illnesses.</p> <p>The toll has prompted fears that this year's expected freeze could lead to an even higher death toll.</p> <p>A hard-hitting campaign to be launched this month by the charity National Energy Action will reveal that there are 700,000 pensioners in England who live without central heating. They want to see the Scottish system introduced, in which all pensioners' homes are fitted with central heating and insulation, regardless of the occupiers' income. </p> <p>The move, brought in six years ago, has been credited with curbing the elderly death rate. In the rest of the UK, however, there has been very little shift in mortality rates from heart attacks, strokes, bronchitis, pneumonia and deaths caused by cold snaps. </p> <p>The charity calculates it would cost \u00a32 billion to do the same south of the border, and would like to see this paid for through a windfall levy on the energy producers. They point out that some of them, such as BP, have made hefty profits this year and that energy bills have generally been rising. The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show that 18,400 people over the age of 75 died last winter in England and Wales as a result of the cold. It is 400 less than the previous year, but campaigners say it is still far too high. </p> <p>Help the Aged claims that Britain now has one of the highest rates of winter deaths in Europe. Countries which have far more severe winter, such as Finland and Germany, have much lower levels of cold-related mortality. </p> <p>The majority of winter deaths are of people over the age of 75. The most common causes are cardiovascular problems, such as a stroke or a heart attack. Commonly, they happen two days after the temperature has fallen sharply, because of the way in which blood clots during the cold. The last bad winter, in January 2000, caused 44,600 deaths in the elderly. </p> <p>Paul Cann, Help the Aged's policy director, said: 'These figures are our national shame. It is no way to die in the twenty-first century. The minimal fluctuation on last year's figures provides cold comfort. If the long-term weather predictions are accurate, this winter will see tem peratures plummet and the death rate soar.' </p> <p>His charity, along with British Gas, is developing a number of initiatives to raise awareness of the issue and provide advice on keeping warm, claiming benefits and insulating homes. </p> <p>In his speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton, Tony Blair referred to policies to help the elderly.'When did you last hear of pensioners freezing to death in the cold because they couldn't afford the heating?' he asked. </p> <p>The government claims that it has done much to help the poorest pensioners avoid the cold. It set up a Warm Front scheme for older people who claim a pension credit so that they can have central heating installed, something worth \u00a32,500. </p> <p>This year the budget for this scheme fell by 11 per cent to \u00a3152m. Every household where there is a person who is 60 or over can also claim a \u00a3200 winter fuel payment. People aged over 80 receive \u00a3300.</p>",
  "The body that determines if terrorist ceasefires have been broken in Northern Ireland is set to deal a damaging blow to the prospects for restoring devolution there. <p>The International Monitoring Commission (IMC) is expected to point the finger at the Provisional IRA over the theft of more than \u00a32m worth of cigarettes in Belfast last month. </p> <p>The commission's report comes amid fresh evidence of IRA activity including robberies and allegations of intelligence gathering on both sides of the Irish border. </p> <p>A non-jury court case currently running in Dublin has also thrown up allegations of an IRA spy ring directed at senior politicians in the Republic. </p> <p>However, both the British and Irish governments remain highly optimistic about a major act of IRA decommissioning in the next few weeks. John de Chastelain, the Canadian general overseeing the destruction of IRA and loyalist arms, was in Dublin this weekend to brief the Irish government over progress towards decommissioning. </p> <p>Last night a prominent unionist predicted an IMC report of ongoing IRA activity would have serious implications for the chances of a deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists aimed at restoring powersharing government. </p> <p>Jeffrey Donaldson, the Lagan Valley MP, said: 'The IMC report will say, I predict, that terrorist activity is winding down but there is ongoing criminality. There can't be a future without paramilitarism unless all aspects of it, including criminality, ends for good.' </p> <p>Sources close to the commission told The Observer that the body would blame the Provisionals for the robbery of Gallagher cigarettes last month during which a lorry driver and his family were held captive in Ardoyne, a republican stronghold in north Belfast. </p> <p>'No one else but the Provos would have the organisation, sophistication and ability to distribute the stolen cigarettes. Nor would anyone else dare hold a family captive in Ardoyne but them,' one source said. </p> <p>The IMC's findings will be based on a report from the Chief Constable Hugh Orde. So far the Police Service of Northern Ireland chief has refused to publish his report or state categorically which group was behind the heist. </p> <p>Orde has been challenged by members of the north's Policing Board to publish the findings of the PSNI investigation before the IMC report. </p> <p>The British government had been hoping that a second IMC report would bolster chances of a political deal. It is understood the IMC will conclude that terrorist activity over the last six months has significantly diminished. </p> <p>In Dublin, meanwhile, there has been resistance and heavy briefing against the IMC investigating IRA activity in the Republic. Sources close to the commission claim senior figures in the Department of Foreign Affairs are questioning whether the IMC should even have an office and investigative capacity south of the border. </p> <p>'They don't want the IMC talking to garda officers or the alleged victims of punishment shootings in Dublin for fear what they might find. .' </p> <p>At Dublin's Special Criminal Court the trial continues tomorrow of a Crumlin man accused of IRA membership. Niall Binead also stands accused of having the personal details of several TDs including a former Minister in the last Cabinet as well as 30 unnamed individuals. </p> <p>Niall Binead, also known as Niall Bennett, 35, of Faughart Road, Crumlin and Kenneth Donohue, 26, of Sundale Avenue, Mountain View, Tallaght, deny membership of an illegal organisation styling itself the Irish Republican Army, otherwise Oglaigh na hEireann, otherwise the IRA on October 10, 2002.</p>",
  "<p>Deepest west London: a crowd watches a young girl wearing a flimsy polka dot dress skate round in a circle in the middle of an ice rink. The music she moves to is a classical cover version of 'Eye of the Tiger'. Her legs are split a full 180 degrees and as she turns she flashes her virginally white knickers to hyped-up photographers and an enthusiastic crowd who whoop and cheer at the spectacle. When the laws of gravity eventually force her movement to come to an end she skates to the edge of the rink. With hands on hips she stops to give a cheeky little pose to the cameras. The music switches to Rossini's overture from William Tell and as the next model enters the rink the first girl skates sassily away. </p> <p>Welcome to the circus that is Fashion Week, the London spring/summer 2005 collection to be precise. For four days the capital is taken over by fashion tribes that converge from all over the world to watch a series of designers compete for column inches and high product sales by putting on a collection of, hopefully, spectacular shows. The stakes for even the most famous designers are high. They have less than 20 minutes to make a lasting impression on press and buyers. Increasingly, the tool designers are using to create that wow factor is music. </p> <p>It doesn't take more than a quick glance at the front rows of the shows or at a music video on MTV to notice the link between music and fashion. Puffy, OutKast's Andre 3000 and Kylie are just a few of the musicians who boost their already fat incomes by dabbling in fashion. But how does the music that accompanies the catwalk shows come about? Until the 1950s catwalk shows were silent apart from the titles of the dresses being announced. Fast forward to the 21st century and the high-octane white label tracks that can be heard at many of the shows are often played on the catwalk before they make it into clubs. The music works like a soundtrack to a film and sets the mood for the show. It helps if the models find it easy to walk with the music, but sometimes they are not even walking... </p> <p>Queensway ice rink is the not-so-fashionable setting for the Peter Jensen show in west London. The music pursues the theme of the show - it's a tribute to skating anti-heroine Tonya Harding. Two girls in lemon sorbet-coloured raincoats swish by like a pair of Forties movie starlets in an epic musical. The too-cool-for-school fashionistas let themselves get caught up in the emotion of the performance, screaming with delight at the breathtaking moves and oohing and ahhing at the outfits. </p> <p>From cheesy classical covers of pop and rock tracks such as 'Reach Out and I'll Be There' to 'The Waltz' from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty , a musical backdrop is created that is not just evocative of a mood but so self-referential that nothing can be taken too seriously. Both Jensen and Fabio Almeida, the DJ who produced the music, delight in taking a humorous approach and in fashion any irreverence makes for a welcome breath of fresh air. Apparently, the production of the soundtrack is always last minute. 'It takes a few mixes to get the final product,' says Almeida. 'I have one evening where I sit down at my computer and see what works and what doesn't and then it's just a matter of presenting it to the designer.' </p> <p>The Temperley show is held in the opulent setting of the Porchester Hall. The venue's art deco ceilings bedecked with crystal chandeliers add to the high fashion feel of the show. Alice Temperley's designs consist of delicately feminine dresses favoured by Hollywood A-listers including Gwyneth Paltrow, Kirsten Dunst and Scarlett Johansson. It's hardly cutting-edge. But when the lights are dimmed and the music starts, the atmosphere completely changes. Alec Wek and model of the moment Lilli strut down the runway to a chunky house bassline. When Jacquetta Wheeler sashays long-leggedly to the tango rhythms of Sarah Vaughan's 'Whatever Lola Wants' mixed into the Gotan Project's version, the effect is so sensual it's almost obscene. </p> <p>'The theme of the music was anything to do with alluring and dangerous women,' says Theo Green, who produced the music for the show. 'There's a big tango theme running through the soundtrack because that style of music brings out that sexy but dangerous side in women.' Green's background is in film so music and dialogue from movies such as The Wicker Man, The Ninth Gate and Las Vampiras that hint at the theme were layered on top of the other tracks. 'Some of the tracks may not instantly strike you as the most obvious music to walk to but I think it's good to break it up.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, backstage at the Boyd show there is a maelstrom of half-clothed models and agents. In a corner quaffing a mini-bottle of Mo\u00ebt is Dannii Minogue. 'The soundtracks to the shows are so important,' she enthuses. 'Can you imagine watching the shows without music?' </p> <p>Former Human League member Adrian Wright is Tracey Boyd's partner, and he certainly can't. 'Every season I buy millions of records and every few months I play them to Tracey, who makes a shortlist of the tracks that she thinks would work,' he says. 'We don't bother about whether the girls are going to find them easy to walk to as good models can walk to anything.' </p> <p>The models for east London-based designers PPQ are the Cazals, a four-piece rock group signed to 1234 records, whose roster includes bands such as Pete Doherty's Babyshambles and Whitey. The record label and PPQ share the same building, and it's this interface between music and fashion that provides the starting point for the two designers behind PPQ, Percy Parker and Amy Molyneux. </p> <p>'I was inspired for the show by the music that's coming through on the label,' says Molyneux. 'It's a really good feeling because I can sense what's current and what people want and how they want to look.' </p> <p>The pair chose to work with the Cazals because they're a gorgeous bunch of lads who ooze stage presence. And while the band say they're not that bothered about fashion, Phil Bush, the lead singer, admits that many people call him a dandy. 'I used to be a Soho dandy mod when I was younger so I guess my approach to fashion is influenced by that.' Yet he struggles to find a contemporary youth culture that merges music and fashion in the same way that the mod scene used to. 'A look goes with a sound that makes the youth culture. That's what used to define youth culture; people dressing differently to identify them as belonging to a specific group. But youth cultures like that don't exist in Britain anymore.' </p> <p>To find the last time British fashion and music united to make a statement, you might need to go back as far as 1974 when Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood opened their shop, Sex. 'Fashion and music were the expressions of the same needs,' says McLaren, who regularly attends the shows. 'In retrospect it seems natural that a shop producing a street fashion of boredom should be the venue for its music: punk rock. </p> <p>'But both industries began to control the artists,' he continues, 'and in turn those artists became more like product managers. The rules were set and if you attempted to change them you would no longer be wanted on location.' </p> <p>Hedi Slimane, designer for Dior Homme and the hottest name in fashion at the moment, doesn't quite see it that way. 'I always connected with music,' he says when I catch up with him during Paris Fashion Week. 'I had my first David Bowie album when I was six years old!' </p> <p>Slimane has dressed a lot of rock stars and bands, including his current favourites the Libertines. But when it comes to the music for his shows, he asks particular musicians to compose a soundtrack for him. 'Beck composed the music for my show in Los Angeles in July while he was recording his album. I could do what others usually do and use a DJ and a mix, but I never liked the idea that the music wouldn't be a creation of its own. The show becomes a collective enterprise.' </p> <p>If the fashionistas are thrilled by such a process, what of the musicians? One would imagine that walking down a catwalk in designer clothes to the soundtrack of your own band's music would feel pretty cool but Martin, the Cazals' guitarist, isn't so impressed. 'We've done shows in Paris and Tokyo and worked with famous designers but I find fashion boring,' he moans. 'At the end of the day they're only clothes.'</p>",
  "<p>Seattle is the city in which American architectural reputations are made or lost. But mostly lost. </p> <p>It's ready to take risks, and it's rich enough to pay for them. It's still young enough to need to build a lot of the essential urban landmarks that other, older cities take for granted, without having acquired too many preconceptions about how they should look. </p> <p>Minoru Yamasaki built his first major project here for Seattle's 1962 world fair. His gothic pavilions still go marching through the city's park like gothic Martian monsters on the loose from The War of the Worlds . They are a ghostly echo of the bottom floors of the World Trade Centre's twin towers, which he went on to build, grouped around stagnant ponds under the shadow of the panting, wheezing lift-cars that clatter up and down the Space Needle, Seattle's most famous landmark. </p> <p>Robert Venturi built the Seattle Art Museum, where he first tried out the ideas that he later put to work with such curious effect for the Sainsbury wing of London's National Gallery, but was never asked to repeat in America. And it is where Frank Gehry designed the first resounding flop of his recent career, the Experience Music Project. </p> <p>Software billionaire Paul Allen's self-indulgent celebration of rock is housed in what looks like a great dollop of melting blue ice-cream, flanked by a warped twisted breaking wave of silver and purple aluminium, and a soap bubble the colour of a bluebottle. </p> <p>For Rem Koolhaas, unlike all his predecessors, Seattle has turned into a career-saver. After a grim year in which every project that he touched, from expanding the Whitney, to building a hotel for Ian Schrager, ended up in him getting fired, Koolhaas's Seattle Public library opened in May and against all expectations was a runaway success. The New York Times critic gushed that it was the greatest building it had been his honour to review. </p> <p>The place is filled, not just with the usual architecture groupies, but with Seattle's citizens. They use its free computer terminals, they play chess, they go to lectures in the Microsoft auditorium. They mount exhibitions of mural paintings on the theme of patriotism in the lobby. </p> <p>Nobody has been more taken aback by the almost embarrassingly positive reaction than Rem Koolhaas himself. He had already given up on America and refused to take part in the Ground Zero competition, fulminating about America's attempt to create a massive monument to self-pity on a Stalinist scale, and taken himself off to Beijing to build the city's tallest tower for China's state-run TV service. Now he was back, eating some of his more embittered words about America. </p> <p>Koolhaas's library, the third to be built on this site in less than 100 years, is a pile of eccentrically stacked glass volumes. From the outside it's a self-contained, crystalline iceberg, 11 floors high set in the midst of the surrounding skyscrapers. </p> <p>Inside is a series of genuinely beautiful spaces that despite Koolhaas's reputation for cynical iconoclasm rely on surprisingly traditional devices. Tall, sunlit reading rooms are exhilarat ing because they make the simple act of finding a book and sitting at a desk feel good. Koolhaas allows you to look out of the window at the spectacular views of the city. He takes you up a vivid green escalator that propels you through a crevasse in a raw concrete slab to deliver you into the soaring reading room with the ambience of a Victorian railway station. </p> <p>Koolhaas avoids the impression of artistic preconceptions about architecture. Instead he claims that this is a place in which the book has been cut down to size: 'Our ambition is to redefine the library as an institution no longer exclusively dedicated to the book, but as an information store where all potent forms of media, new and old, are presented equally and legibly.' </p> <p>Koolhaas describes the library as a functional diagram. In fact, it has been designed to look as if it has not been designed, and there is, in fact, plenty of artifice in it. He claims to have worked with the library to analyse its working methods, taking them apart, and repacking them in an entirely new way. Instead of conventional, supposedly flexible identical floors, Koolhaas has packed a cluster of different functions, each in volumes with their own distinctive character, into a loose glass envelope, around a huge void that runs the full height of the building. This is linked by ramps and escalators, in the manner advocated by Adolf Loos a century ago. </p> <p>Koolhaas enjoys playing aesthetic games; contrasting rough with smooth. The raw concrete lift shaft at the centre of the library plays against wood veneer. There are areas of saturated colour: blood-red meeting rooms provide a shocking contrast to the pale colours of the ground floor. The glass envelope is revealed at night to be supported by a hefty diagonal steel bracing, which stiffens the structure against earthquakes. </p> <p>Koolhaas is an architect devoted to the pursuit of pessimism, but Seattle is a city that has warmed him up. It is a city with enough dignity and self-belief to make the words on the foundation stone salvaged from the city's first public library funded by Andrew Carnegie, that now stands next to a wall honouring the donations of Bill and Melissa Gates not sound entirely hollow: 'The surplus wealth of the few shall become in the best sense the property of the many because administered for the common good.' </p> <p>As the library's daunting rules of conduct remind us, that common good must acknowledge the range of users that a public library will attract. 'Verbally or physically threatening or harassing other patrons, volunteers or staff, including staring, lurking, offensive touching and obscene acts' is enough to get patrons banned. So is 'using restrooms for bathing or shampooing, doing laundry or changing clothes, lying down, or sleeping'. But the library is still a heart warmingly democratic space .</p>",
  "Six weeks ago, The Observer asked six people just starting out at very different points in the world of education to record their hopes and fears in personal journals. As the autumn term progresses, we hear how some are having the best time of their lives, while for others the past few weeks have brought upset, stress, strains - and, for one, the threat of a court case. <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b>Anna Whicher</b>, 18, a former pupil of the private Badminton School, has started at Reading University after failing to get the A-level grades she needed to study French and history at Warwick. </p> <p>After being so horribly disappointed not to get a place at Warwick and feeling I was coming to Reading on sufferance, the moment I walked into Wantage Hall, I knew this was the right place to be. </p> <p>I thought I must have strayed into an Oxford college: Wantage is like something out of Harry Potter. The dining room looks like the great hall at Hogwarts, with long wooden tables and portraits on the walls. It has some bizarre traditions, such as letting sheep into the court once a year. </p> <p>Reading was my 'insurance offer', so I only had temporary accommodation. It was torturous not knowing whether I could stay in the hall, but I made friends with the other temporary students who were in the same boat and kept my fingers crossed. My corridor is mixed, so when I walk out of the shower, there are men everywhere, which is a culture shock. </p> <p>I know it's a clich\u00e9 but freshers week has been one of the best weeks of my life. I am missing my best friends, Lucy and Ed, but I've averaged four hours' sleep a night thanks to an endless stream of drinking, meeting new people and having so much fun. </p> <p>The atmosphere is incredible: we have quiz nights, drinking competitions and speed dating. When we get home in the early hours, quiet snacks in the kitchen degenerate into food fights involving the whole corridor, with chairs as barricades and food, shaving cream and water as ammunition. </p> <p>I was told last week that a room had become available in Wantage if I would be prepared to share a room. I would, so that's wonderful. </p> <p>Budgeting is another preoccupation. I'm spending way over my set amount for socialising and drinking, but once I'm fully into the course I expect that will slow down. </p> <p>Lectures started last week, and they have been fascinating, but I have been given work like there is no tomorrow. It's getting a bit hectic trying to balance everything but it's all part of the game. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b>Azim Ansari</b> was 14 when he and his brother smuggled themselves into Britain from Afghanistan in 2001.

Our old solicitor was too far away for us to visit regularly. The upshot is that we have had to tell our story again. </p> <p>It's hard for me. I'm trying to start a new life in Oxford, and having to retell it reminds me how uncertain my life is and that I don't know if it will ever be secure. </p> <p>I watch the students around me going out and having a good time, and I don't know if I even have it in me to behave like that now; I have too much on my mind to let go.

They worry they won't be able to make conversation with me when I come back. </p> <p>I have never wanted university to change me - I was determined to keep my accent, for example - but my stepmum's comment made me realise it could happen, and I'm even more determined now to ensure that it doesn't. </p> <p>Even so, I've made such good friends here so quickly that I go through periods where I completely forget my friends at home. It's worrying how easily I can forget people. Queens' College has started to feel like home after just a few weeks. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that Queens is such an insular place. My lectures take place within 250 yards of my rooms and the college has so many facilities, I rarely have to leave the grounds. There is a real chance that I will absorb the culture without realising it, and I will have to make sure that doesn't happen. </p> <p>Before I arrived, the thought of living with people who had had everything given to them with a silver spoon, both in terms of education and life chances, really worried me. I was concerned I would be looked down on because I would be far behind the private school kids in terms of extra-curricular education and because I didn't have the chance to prepare myself for life here. Because no one from Bradford College had been to Oxbridge in 30 years, I had to focus entirely on simply getting myself here, so I was worried that students from the [private] schools would have had far more time to do all sorts of background preparation. </p> <p>I anticipated I would only really make friends with state school people and there would be two distinct groups.

I am Ofsted trained, so I sit in and judge the quality of the teaching. It's difficult for the teachers but they will have to get used to it: if their lessons are satisfactory, I will only repeat the inspection twice a term. If they continue to fail, I will act, both to support and to challenge them. </p> <p>I have to be delicate, though. I have set up a support system so teachers don't feel undermined, and understand that it's not a personal criticism but an opportunity for professional development. </p> <p>I am already experiencing problems, however. One teacher is finding the changes quite hard going. We've offered her additional support but she's proving resistant. </p> <p>It's the same with parents. They say to me all the time that I'm new and I don't understand how things were. </p> <p>I'm starting with immediate, smaller changes that will have an obvious impact, to give people confidence in me. Lunchtimes are chaotic, which is going to change, and the back gate is going to be locked so all late children come past the reception area. There are a lot of them now, which is disrupts lessons. </p> <p>A mother told me last week that her 10-year-old daughter was being bullied. I had to admit we didn't have an active anti-bullying programme, although work was going into developing one. </p> <p>The mother reported it to governors. It was awkward, but par for the course as I strive to improve the school. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> <b>Jon Hanna</b>, 24, started his first job this term as a qualified history and religious education teacher at the Seacole Centre, a pilot project targeted at troubled GCSE students in Hackney. </p> <p>I've just seen one of the new TV teacher recruitment advertisements. A colleague was very upset because it pictures idyllic students who develop their opinions based on their school experience. </p> <p>It just isn't like that, and I'm glad: that would be boring. Our students have lots of challenging options and beliefs. They don't come to my lessons empty and need to fill up: they are not cars. It's more like they are coming to dinner and all bringing different foods, which I have to make into a suitable meal. </p> <p>It was great coming back to school [Hanna taught there before qualifying], but I'm already thinking I spend more time dealing with problems than actually teaching. For some students, coming to school is an alarming experience where they exchange a comfortable, loving environment for a chaotic, bustling, busy place where people forget their name and know little about them. </p> <p>Yet for the really unlucky ones, school is a longed-for escape from a difficult and oppressive home existence. They need us most. </p> <p>I met an old friend from university last week, who now earns three times what I get, and has all his evenings and weekends to himself. </p> <p>I felt jealous at first and wondered if I'd made a massive mistake. Then I wondered if he really has as much fun at work as me, whether his 'clients' crack him up quite as much as my students do me. I doubt it. The good thing about teaching is that you are never bored. Stressed, yes, but bored? Definitely not. </p> <p>I've hit one big problem already, and don't know what to do. I've been trained to design our lessons for students of all abilities. But what should I be doing with those who can't read at all? </p> <p>The political chat now is all about inclusion, and it's right in principle. But is it right that we allow some students to go through school and leave without the most basic skills? </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> <b>Tom Widdows</b> is principal of the successful Bexley Business Academy, in south London, which recently hit the headlines by threatening to take Ofsted to court. </p> <p>Last month we became the first city academy to challenge Ofsted over a finding of 'significant weaknesses' in teaching. Schools are not officially allowed to question its judgment, but encouraged to push the boundaries. To us that means rejecting an irrational, inconsistent and preposterous report. </p> <p>We were so outraged by the findings of the inspectors, who interfered in the way we teach, that we instructed Queen's Counsel. Ofsted eventually withdrew the report, replacing it with a less formal monitoring letter. </p> <p>Ofsted's persistence in standing by its findings without first addressing our formal complaint, which challenged the way those findings were arrived at, raised many questions about the appropriateness of an organisation that is self-regulatory. </p> <p>We have now received a response, which requires a further response from us, and so it goes on... </p> <p>So it was a difficult end to last term and, even though we won our point, I feel angry about the amount of time and energy the school has been forced to spend on getting Ofsted to simply listen to our case. Our job is to teach children, not get into these arguments. Strangely, the whole idiotic affair energised us; we came back at the beginning of this term more unified, determined and positive than ever. </p> <p>We're fortunate that financially we can fight Ofsted, but I am even more fortunate to be surrounded by an innovative governing body and supportive parents who are brave enough to fight. Often governing bodies feel intimidated by Ofsted, but we felt we had to state our case because the transformation we have witnessed in our students has been astounding. Only two students obtained five A* to C GCSE passes in the final year of Thamesmead Community College, the failing school we replaced. </p> <p>We achieved 35 per cent this year and with all our students getting at least one GCSE we are in the top five per cent of schools nationally. At Thamesmead, the exclusion rate was more than 20 a year. We have excluded only five students in the last year. Attendance is up from 70 per cent to 90 per cent. </p> <p>Our idea of long school days is working brilliantly: we have more than 100 children coming in at 7am. They have breakfast, use the computers and do homework. </p> <p>The really big thing for me is that the school is open until 9pm and a lot of teachers work late to do their work, so many students see them as role models. I see classrooms of teachers and students sitting quietly together, doing separate work. </p> <p>I found that quite emotional. It proves we're instilling a feeling in students that learning is something they really want to do.</p>"
