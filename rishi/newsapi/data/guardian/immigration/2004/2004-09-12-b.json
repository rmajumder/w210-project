  "<p>It was raining in Itamambuca, as it had been for several days. The cramped room smelt of mosquito coils and of pairs of poorly washed socks drying on an upturned pan in the doorway of the open oven. There was no sound except that of the water thrumming on the roof tiles and the clack of the giant green beetles gorging themselves on a clutch of rotting coconuts hanging a couple of metres from our little balcony. </p> <p>In front of the hotel, the right-hand front tyre of our car was imperceptibly deflating. For thousands of kilometres in most directions, nothing at all was happening. And yet, 100 metres from where we lay, watching the row of clothes on the improvised line strung between the wardrobe and the television suck ever more dampness from the limpid humidity, was one of the most beautiful beaches we had ever seen. We were on holiday. </p> <p>And, also, halfway through a roadtrip of significant proportions. Three weeks to explore the 3,000 kilometres of Brazilian coastline that arcs up like a plant stem from the Uruguayan border and flowers spectacularly at Rio de Janeiro. It was unfortunate that my girlfriend Mariana and I had chosen to make the trip in January, the month of the Brazilian rainy season, but it hadn't meant more than having perfect sunny mornings followed by overcast afternoons, by which time we had usually had enough of the beach anyway. Until now. </p> <p>Earlier in Rosa, 1,000km to the south-west and our first port of call, the odd downpour hadn't been too much of a problem. From the large terrace cantilevered off the upper floor of our jungle caba\u00f1a , we had a fine view of one of the best surfing beaches in the country, and within less than 10 minutes walk (or, ahem, five minutes' drive) were various surfer-dude hangouts dishing up Trivial de Frango, a carb-heavy, wallet-light feast of grilled chicken, white rice, and farofa (or maize flour, a traditional staple here). There was also the Tigre Asiatico, a quality sushi house with an LA ambience and a good selection of bars. </p> <p>Itamambuca, however, didn't boast too much in the way of culinary diversion. We were self-catering here, though even leaving the place to drive to one of the supermarkets in nearby Ubatuba was a problem, because of the rutted dirt road that connected us with the highway, which was left in such a terrible state in order to discourage casual traffic and those without SUVs - in this part of Brazil most of the more exclusive beach communities have deliberately terrible access, to keep out hoi polloi in their City cars. The tactic hasn't worked in Rosa, which, in the last 10 years, has grown from a twinkle in the tourist minister's eye into a bustling beach town, despite the road remaining sufficiently severe to do irrevocable damage to the suspension of our Peugeot (which I supposed served us right for being lazy and taking the car). </p> <p>The disaster wasn't immediately apparent. We didn't even realise anything was wrong until we were some way north of Florianopolis, an enormous and apparently purpose-designed peninsula, shaped like a giant tack and smothered in tourist resorts. But by the time we reached Santos, the port which serves the S\u00e3o Paolo megatropolis, there was a rattle of indisputable novelty coming from somewhere under the car. Not the kind of rattle, unfortunately, that we later bought off some indigenous peoples while driving through their reservation in the state of Eastern Parana on the return journey home, but the kind that builds hour by hour, day by day, until you can no longer carry on pretending that something isn't about to go dangerously wrong. </p> <p>By happy chance Santos boasts not just a repair shop, but an entire district of brand-name garages, and before we took the ferry across the harbour mouth and thereby committed ourselves to the northern leg of our journey, we decided to swing by House of Peugeot and get a quick diagnosis. </p> <p>Good thing we did. Bouncing around on Rosa's unruly dirt roads had all but worn through the bearing casings on the front wheels - another 200 kilometres and they would have given out completely, allowing the axle to spin free of its housing and thus create a breakdown of catastrophically expensive (and dangerous) proportions. </p> <p>Less fortunately, this part of Santos wasn't the kind of place you wanted to stop for the night. Even finding lunch was something of an adventure, while friendly to cars the area was extremely hostile to people. The local bank, cafe and supermarket all had metal detectors built at their entrances, and I wasn't able to get through the revolving doors of the former (which automatically held you hostage if you had anything more substantial than a belt buckle on your person) until I had unloaded mobile phone, palm pilot, MP3 player, digital camera, torch, keyring and my various other items of techno-traveller detritus for the benefit of the security guard peering suspiciously down on me from the other side of the bulletproof glass. </p> <p>But the repair guys did us proud and by sundown we were back on the road with little ahead of us, but two weeks of lazy beach-bummery. From here on our route divided into three distinct phases: first, the stretch from Santos to S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (an attractive, town with cool modern suburbs and a colonial centre) was full of small but perfectly formed beaches, most of which have been annexed by the rich. You can't buy the sand in Brazil, but you can buy up the jungle next to it, and that's just what has happened here, where villas and gated communities effectively block access to much of the best bits of the coast. </p> <p>Next was the other extreme: a sort of linear city that stretched all the way from S\u00e3o Sebastiao to Ubatuba, a town we initially found alienating and polluted but which we eventually came to realise, after circumstance forced us to spend more time there than we had bargained for, was actually quite a funky little place. </p> <p>The beaches here tended to be long, open, and heavily populated - fun if you're a teenager or need somewhere to dump your family for a couple of weeks, but less so if you're a young couple exhibiting the sociopathic tendencies concomitant with the incipient nesting instinct, and accordingly we quickly moved on to the bit of coast that stretches from Ubatuba to Rio. </p> <p>This section is well served by the BR101, a road which, if you sit on it and press the accelerator for long enough, will deliver you to the USA (though it won't, of course, guarantee that the Americans will let you cross the border), and it was our favourite bit of the trip. </p> <p>Here, exploitation has yet to get a firm grip and there are still places that remain relatively undiscovered. Which is all the more reason for me not to write about them - if I tell you our favourite spots then you'll all be there hogging the deckchairs by the time I return. But they're not too hard to find, given that they're all within two or three hours' drive of Rio. </p> <p>If you want a good base you could do worse than Parati, a heavily restored colonial port of the kind that travel writers inevitably refer to as 'charming' that is home both to a flotilla of tourist boats only too happy to take you around the idyllic selection of islands clustered just off the coast, and a packed calendar of festivals, including an Anglo-Brazilian literary beano that promises to become a favourite in the diaries of those who can rustle up the airfare or, failing that, blag their way in (definitely my preferred option). </p> <p>Talking of Rio, it wasn't quite the party town I had expected. My chief impression was of a city of retirees, populated (at least in the more salubrious parts) by people who bought property here in the 1960s and 1970s and are now seeing out their calmer years in sun- and memory-drenched comfort. Our hotel, for example, boasted emergency buttons by the bed, safety rails in every possible position, and an on-call cardiac team. </p> <p>Outside, the famous esplanades of Ipanema and Copacabana throb less with good-time-girls and gigolos than vigorous 60- and 70-year-olds pounding heartily up and down the pavements, weighed down by electronic pulse meters, stopping only to have their blood pressure checked at the many nursing stations on the seafront. Still we did manage to blag our way into a high-octane carnival rehearsal party in the district of Lapa, which helped quell my longing for the more romantic Rio of my imagination. </p> <p>As for the journey home, highlights included an enforced stay in a sex hotel with a five-metre plunge pool in the bathroom; driving at speed in the pouring rain into a pothole so wide and so deep that it didn't just blow out the tyre, it dented the wheel; getting stuck behind a nuclear waste truck that had blown out its brakes on a mountain pass and nearly come off the road; and trying (and failing) to out-race a hurricane. </p> <p>But if you want to hear those stories you'll have to invite me round for tea and sit quietly while I deluge you with holiday snaps.

  "<p>'Ah, Odessa,' an acquaintance from Russia rhapsodised when I told her that I was off to the Ukrainian city - or the 'pearl of the Black Sea', as the brochures have it. 'It's so romantic. You should just walk around: the courtyards, the streets, the sea.' Once the third city of old Russia after Moscow and St Petersburg, it's like Rio to the Russians, who flock here for its warm climate, beaches, cafes and nightlife - and quite possibly for its historic buildings, culture and chess. </p> <p>Could it be a weekend break for the British? Well, why not? Odessa's in Europe, although you can't fly directly. And it's a great enigma: the very name 'Odessa' is full of Cold War romance. I went via Budapest to find out more. </p> <p>Odessa's airport didn't disappoint. Like something from a le Carr\u00e9 novel, it was white, rectilinear and staffed by knuckleheads in green uniforms. The time they spent rubberstamping my passport smelled of the KGB. But I emerged, met my driver and sped - truly sped - through the sunny boulevards and Stalinist blocks of suburban Odessa to the Chorne More Hotel, a smoked glass ex-Intourist pile tweaked into the market era but retaining a bracing touch of anti-service. The receptionist kept my passport for 20 minutes. Why? She gave me a look that said: 'None of your business, buster.' </p> <p>The cobbled streets, lime trees and noble but desiccated buildings made for a pretty sight. I had a beer in the bar and went to the hotel's sanitorium. In a UK spa, you get backlit twigs and whale song. Here a middle-aged guy with hands like hams pummelled me and finally spoke. 'Where from?' 'London.' 'I have been,' he growled. 'Tilbury!' Of course: Odessa was always a key Russian port. </p> <p>I explored Odessa's central grid of streets, faintly redolent of New York. The cobbles, plane trees and wide (if cracked) pavements gave on to a new economy of internet cafes, fashion shops and bars towards the centre. Sailors swaggered around whistling at girls. </p> <p>Great fun. Yet through the gloaming I could also see an older Odessa, where little old ladies hauled faggots of firewood home and old fellows dipped wheelie bins. These ghost-like individuals, mostly elderly, represented a generation that had lost to the market. I dived into a couple of Odessa's handsome onion-domed Orthodox churches, near the impossibly grand railway station, and saw a devotion scarcely even seen in southern Italy. </p> <p>Ann turned up in the morning to show me round Odessa. I had explained that I wanted a young guide to help with bar research and when she turned up, I shouldn't have been surprised at her pink nail varnish, short skirt and general pulchritude. </p> <p>In 'Back in the USSR', the Lennon-McCartney lyric goes, 'The Ukraine girls really knock me out', and I soon learnt that Odessa's women are a tourist attraction in their own right, encouraged by a demi-monde of matchmaking websites catering for chaps of a certain age. At breakfast, discussing the day's museum plans with a nice German family, a hefty lone English gent at the next table piped up: 'You're missing out the best sight of all: the bloody women!' </p> <p>Ann and I walked down leafy avenues to Odessa's centre to see the baroque Opera House. Odessa was impressive architecturally, like St Petersburg in a Mediterranean-style climate. It celebrated its 200th anniversary in 1994, harking back to the date when Catherine the Great decided it was a useful harbour and up it went, a neo-classical new town. It's fallen on harder times, but has still got the feeling of a set-piece city, such as Bath. </p> <p>We looked at this Albert Hall of the Near East and the Mozart Hotel opposite, catering for Odessa's new money, then walked further into grand streets full of ornate Art Nouveau apartment blocks that had been bought back to life. Ann was encouraged. 'There,' she said proudly, 'is our first Armani shop.' </p> <p>The streets gave onto the Primorsky Boulevard, which had a great view of the new port, where Russian cruise liners docked on the glittering Black Sea. We passed the statue of Alexander Pushkin, who hung out here in the 1820s, and the Museum of Archaeology, which was closed. Very Soviet. But at least I managed to see the great Ship Museum. </p> <p>Primorsky offered a thriving economy of traders holding iguanas, pythons and small crocodiles with a Polaroid camera, the idea being that you posed holding them. Fending them off, at last we were at Odessa's key sight - indeed, the only sight most of us know - the Potemkin Stairs. Most will know the 192 steps from Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 film classic The Battleship Potemkin , and I felt that the traders should drop the crocs and instead bring a pram to recreate the film's most famous scene. (You'd have to be careful at the bottom though, where there's a main road that's like a racetrack for ancient Ladas.) </p> <p>We walked back up the stairs past the statue of Duke of Richelieu - the French hero of Odessa, who served in the Russian army against the Turks - and stopped for a coffee at the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. One of the stranger facets of Ukraine's market transition has been to encourage a glut of theme bars and D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu's shtick was to have a 'Communist' bar: the past truly satirised. Meanwhile, the real past was tragically neglected. At the eastern end of Primorsky was the Vorontsov Palace, an ochre Palladian-style mansion. Once it would have been Odessa's Buckingham Palace, but near-derelict and covered in graffiti, it was a casualty of recent history. </p> <p>Back at the main drag, Derybasivska, I saw the Pasazh shopping mall, where trainers were sold beneath baroque statuary, and walked in a park with a tourist market selling folksy tat. Then it was time to sit down at the unbelievably folkloric Kymahel restaurant, where I had a fabulous borscht, before taking a cab back to the hotel, which involves sticking your hand out to any driver. The charming guy who stopped wanted to talk. 'Where from?' he asked, turning around in the seat to offer his card. 'London.' 'I have been,' he said. 'Tilbury!' </p> <p>Back at the hotel, I met Andrew Evans, author of the Bradt Guide to Ukraine , who loved Odessa. 'It's a port, and it's got that Marseille, Naples thing to it. It's very cosmopolitan.' Indeed, there were Russians, Greeks, Romanians, several Turkish bars, a mosque and a synagogue near to my hotel. Odessa had always been a crossroads. But there had been tragedy, too. The famine of the 1920s and the war killed a lot of Odessites, mainly Jews. It became Soviet in 1944. I had the feeling Odessa hadn't recovered yet from the 20th century. </p> <p>Andrew was leading a British tour group, and I drove with them past the enormous regimented beaches that run from Odessa up the coast for 10 miles. Of my companions, one had been to see the site of her grandmother's shtetl (just like the hero of Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything is Illuminated, in which a New Yorker searches for his grandfather's village) and the next day they were off to Yalta and then Crimea, to see where the Charge of the Light Brigade faltered 150 years ago. Ukraine tends to attract the special-interest tourist. </p> <p>Later Andrew and I ended in Friends and Beer, a basement bar with a bizarre menu including roast beef and Yorkshire pudding - almost an English theme bar. It was during Euro 2004 and we couldn't get a seat. I pointed to an empty table and asked for a glass of wine. The waitress shook her head. Is this typical? 'You'll get that for a while, then they'll suddenly come up with something,' said Andrew. The customer is always wrong, but soon we were applauding Russia against Spain with a local, Igor. </p> <p>In 10 years' time? Well, Ukraine (never the Ukraine) is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. The sanitoria of the Black Sea are diversifying into plastic surgery. Sooner or later, a direct flight will come. God forbid, perhaps the stag nighters will arrive. In the meantime, if you're into pioneering Eastern European cities, Odessa scoops Tallinn or Riga. And unlike other Eastern cities, it made me feel foreign. Homeward bound, I was dropped at Odessa airport and noticed a crowd outside the terminal. The cause of the diversion? A dancing bear in a cage. It wouldn't happen at Gatwick. </p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>Oliver Bennett travelled with Regent Holidays (0117 921 1711, <a href=\"http://www.regent-holidays.co.uk\">www.regent-holidays.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>Any old iron? No thank you. Not when 'status' appliances are all the rage. </p> <p>When it comes to fridges and cookers, consumers are making 'lifestyle choices'. Appliances must be aesthetically enticing and large enough to attract gasps of appliance envy. </p> <p>Sadly, an AA+ grade energy rating just doesn't cut the mustard.</p> <p>Take the 'status' fridge. A US import, it's fast becoming the SUV of the kitchen. Bigger than some spare rooms, it may have an integrated ice dispenser, but it will also typically possess a lame F or G energy rating. This pretty much sticks two fingers up at people who spend their time conserving kilojoules by only boiling as much water as they need and running up draught excluders. </p> <p>True, you can shift your energy tariff to a green one (go to www.foe. co.uk), but if renewable energy is to stand a fighting chance, we need to drastically reduce our energy demands, wholesale. Instead, home appliances are still the world's fastest-growing energy users, responsible for 30 per cent of energy consumption in industrial countries and 12 per cent of their greenhouse gas emissions. It's hard to plead ignorance: the EU has a mandatory rating system for grading appliances in terms of energy efficiency. </p> <p>The ubiquitous wide-screen TV uses 14 per cent more electricity than its slender relatives. Over the next decade, the UK population will buy 63m TVs (many wide-screen), along with 70m set-top boxes and 14m VCRs and DVD players. Meanwhile, abandoned appliances are landfilled or stored in warehouses - fridge mountains are the latter-day butter mountains. The EU's unappealingly named WEEE directive puts the onus on appliance manufacturers to divert e-waste from landfill, with the emphasis on recycling, but we consumers won't see the full effects of this new policy until 2008.</p> <p>Adopting a Luddite stance - raging against appliances and preaching about the evils of planned obsolescence - is practically in the job description of the ethical-living enthusiast. So it gives me great pleasure to break with tradition and recommend dishwashers. According to recent research by the University of Bonn, they use three to four times less water and equal or less amounts of energy than washing up by hand. The caveat is that with 'good technique', hand washer-uppers can redress the balance. Also, the study doesn't take into account the manufacturing processes of the dishwasher versus that of producing a sink. </p> <p>The manufacturing process is often ignored. Components for appliances have been traced to sweatshops. Casings and coatings contain toxic chemicals, placing the health of the manufacturing worker and consumer alike at risk (www.greenpeace.org.uk). And many well-known manufacturers have their fingers in far less innocuous pies - such as the defence industry and controversial damming projects (www.ethicalconsumer.org). Arguably, these are the decisions that constitute real 'lifestyle choices', not whether it comes in powder blue with a matt finish.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\">lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>September marks the point where our cooking takes a small but significant step towards autumn. Already, I have noticed slight changes in what I cook for supper, and have spotted the first early pumpkins and game birds in the shops. While I am not yet ready for big casseroles, I do find warm food is becoming my first thought. And from now on, those gorgeously fruity tomatoes growing in my garden are more likely to be baked than sliced in a salad.</p> <p>Like a true Brit, I hold on to summer until the last leaves have fallen off the trees. Any meal that can be is eaten outside, and if that means putting on a sweater, then so be it. Only pouring rain will stop me lighting a grill and cooking my kebabs in the open air, and it would probably take a hailstorm to prevent me from having breakfast in the garden.

Cook for a further couple of minutes until the mussels have opened.</p> <p>Taste the broth; it may need salt and pepper. Throw out the bay leaves. Add the coriander.

Pour over the remaining olive oil and bake for 25 minutes until the filling is golden.</p> <p><strong>Avocado and warm bacon vinaigrette</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 2</strong></p> <p>One of those salads that is substantial enough to eat as a light supper with some good bread.</p> <p>avocados - 2, perfectly ripe</p> <p>streaky bacon - 3 rashers</p> <p>tomatoes - 3 decent-sized</p> <p>red wine vinegar - 3 tablespoons</p> <p>extra-virgin olive oil - 50ml</p> <p>Dijon mustard - 2 tablespoons</p> <p>flat-leafed parsley<br></p> <p>Cut the bacon rashers into thinnish strips and fry to a crisp in a shallow pan. Throw the vinegar and olive oil into the pan with the bacon, chop the tomatoes roughly and add them too, then stir in the mustard and leave everything to bubble for a minute. Chop the parsley.</p> <p>Peel and halve the avocados then remove the stones. Cut into thick slices then toss gently with the parsley and warm dressing.</p> <p><strong>Grilled lamb kebabs with cumin and crushed chillies</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 2-3</strong></p> <p>A sweet red onion and tomato salad is just the thing with this.</p> <p>serves 2-3</p> <p>lamb, chump chops or steak - 450g, cubed</p> <p>garlic - 2 cloves</p> <p>crushed dried chillies - 1 level teaspoon</p> <p>ground cumin - 2 level teaspoons</p> <p>ground coriander - 1 level teaspoon</p> <p>runny honey - 1 tablespoon</p> <p>thick, natural yoghurt</p> <p>lemon juice and more yoghurt to serve</p> <p>Peel and crush the garlic and mix it with the crushed chillies, ground cumin, coriander, honey and yoghurt. Add the lamb and toss gently to coat the meat with the marinade. Set aside somewhere cool for an hour.</p> <p>Thread the cubes of lamb onto skewers. Get the griddle or barbecue hot. Place the kebabs on the grill - they will hiss and crackle and there will be much smoke, but you will see the edges of the meat start to brown. I never start to move the meat until the side on the grill has started to catch a little here and there, maybe even char very slightly.</p> <p>Now cook the other side - it will take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on the temperature of your grill. The meat should end up a dark and glossy brown on the outside, the inside a deep rose pink and juicy.</p> <p>Remove the lamb from the grill, squeeze over the lemon and serve with a tomato and onion salad and perhaps a little more yoghurt.</p> <p><strong>Almost instant chocolate ice cream</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 4-6</strong></p> <p>I use bought custard from the chiller cabinet at the supermarket for this. Check the ingredients carefully though, some brands are better than others.</p> <p>fine quality dark chocolate - 200g</p> <p>a small espresso (about 50ml)</p> <p>fresh custard - 400g</p> <p>whipping cream - 250ml<br></p> <p>Put the chocolate, broken into pieces, and the coffee in a heatproof basin set over a small pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Once the chocolate has melted, stir gently once or twice and turn off the heat. Pour the custard into a jug, then stir in the cream and chocolate. Scoop the mixture into an ice-cream machine and churn till frozen.</p> <p>No ice-cream machine? Then pour the mixture into a plastic box and place in the freezer, removing it and beating the mixture with a hand whisk every couple of hours until it's almost frozen. (You will need to do this two or three times.) If you leave it in the freezer overnight, then place it in the fridge for an hour or so before serving to allow it to soften.</p> <p><strong>The wine list</strong></p> <p><strong>Lamb kebabs with garlic, cumin, chilli and honey</strong></p> <p>2002 Syrah, Laurent Miquel, Vin de Pays d'Oc (\u00a34.99, Threshers)</p> <p>An outstanding buy, this smoky French red is a juicy, easy drinking wine with blackberry fruit and a nip of tannin on the finish.<br></p> <p><strong>Baked tomatoes with mozzarella, anchovies and breadcrumbs</strong></p> <p>2002 Xerolithia, Peza, Crete (\u00a35.49, Oddbins)</p> <p>A spicy, zesty, green olive-scented Greek white that tastes a bit like a superior unoaked chardonnay, albeit with a little more acidity.<br></p> <p><strong>Avocado salad with bacon, Dijon mustard, parsley and tomatoes</strong></p> <p>2003 Villa Maria Pinot Gris Private Bin (\u00a36.99, Waitrose)</p> <p>This ripe, off-dry New Zealand example is a full-flavoured white with just a touch of residual sugar.<br></p> <p><strong>Quick fish soup</strong></p> <p>2003 Casa Marin Sauvignon Blanc, Laurel Vineyard (\u00a313.95, Lay &amp; Wheeler, 0845 330 1855)</p> <p>One of the best New World sauvignon blancs I've ever tasted: nettley, intense and beautifully poised with mouth-watering freshness.<br></p> <p><strong>Chocolate ice cream</strong></p> <p>Lustau East India Solera Rich Oloroso Sherry (\u00a310.99, Waitrose)</p> <p>The sweetness is so well integrated on this that you can pour it over a bowl of ice cream.</p>",
  "<p>The first time I came to Shumi was with this guy who brought me here to declare his undying love for me. It is lovely here at night, because you are high up and you can see the city all lit up. Sadly, the undying love sort of died but I still love the place and the food is far too good to be put off coming back because of some boy. I love Italian food and here it is very, very good. It's private - you have to go up an escalator to get in - which means I don't get hassled, and it's so nice to be in a restaurant without people saying, 'Ooh it's Rebecca Loos, look what she's eating'. I don't mind people asking for autographs - it's lovely if someone is your fan, and they like you, and they want to kiss you and hug you - but when you're out on a date or with friends you just want to pretend you're a normal person.</p> <p>I like being in London even though I am always busy when I'm here. But I'd much rather be busy than sitting in Madrid doing nothing. Madrid is my sanctuary; my family are there, and many of my friends too. I do get a lot of negative attention there though. People feel differently about me in the UK and Holland.</p> <p>I am actually Dutch and I lived in Holland until I was 11. I go back about once a month because I have lots of friends there and I still do quite a lot of interviews for Dutch TV - I used to be a TV presenter, so I'm a different kind of celebrity there. Everyone watches my shows and they love me and they want pictures taken with me. I definitely don't get treated like that here or in Spain. You have to remember that Real Madrid is the biggest team out there so some fanatical supporters were blaming me for how badly the team were performing. Spain is a bit backward and intolerant, especially compared to Holland where it's fine to be bisexual and to speak about relationships and things openly. Here I just get the odd mention in Heat, but the rest of it has died down. If people want to watch you, or talk about you, well, it's all part of the game, isn't it? I'm about to start promoting jewellery here for an Italian firm and I've done some presenting on Channel Five, so I think people's focus will continue to shift even more.</p> <p>I'm a vegetarian (although I eat fish) and that's only because I am an animal lover. I can only eat fish because I don't feel that you make a bond with a little prawn in the sea in the same way that you do a little lamb on a farm.</p> <p>I love Spanish food. Madrid has some very good restaurants and tapas bars. I learnt a few tricks in Spain too, like that it's very good for you to put olive oil, not butter, on your toast in the morning, or to rub half a tomato and some garlic on toast. I'm very big on fruit and I practically live off gazpacho - I eat it with ice cubes in because Madrid is just so hot.</p> <p>I don't have to worry about my weight. You have to know your own body and know what to eat and I guess I am just lucky. I'm the kind of girl who can eat steak and chips (or I did before I became vegetarian) and the next day I'll have a flat stomach, but I can't eat dairy products in the evening because I end up bloated in the morning. I could never stick to a diet - I'm crap at things like that. But at Shumi there are so many lovely things to eat that I don't have to worry about my conscience or my waistline. </p> <p>Shumi, 23 St James's Street, London.

  "<p>Italian cuisine is world-renowned for its use of superb seasonal ingredients and simple cooking methods. Apart from in the home, nowhere is this more apparent than in the cooking of Italy's local restaurants, the trattorias. In fact, the cooking in the best trattorias can be said to be as good as that in the home, for most are family run.</p> <p>Trattoria cooking is home cooking at its best. Often the chefs or owners are determined to have you appreciate their skills or local dishes to the greatest extent. The Slow Food movement, based in the north of Italy, has recently highlighted the unique position of trattorias in Italian life, awarding symbols for excellence. But whether given such accolades or not, most trattorias are the backbone of Italian eating: somewhere you can go for lunch every day and be assured of getting something different, something traditional, something reasonable in price and something really well cooked. The recipes here - some from family-run trattorias I know or have found, some from friends' families and some of my own - reflect that glorious creativity.</p> <p><strong>Sausages with lentils</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 6</strong></p> <p>This is a perfect New Year's Eve dish, as lentils are believed to bring money when eaten at the beginning of the year.

Drain the lentils, add to the pan and saute for 2 minutes. Add 250ml of the beef froth and the bouquet garni, cover and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 1? hours. Do keep a check on the liquid, adding more broth if necessary.</p> <p>Heat a grill pan. Butterfly the sausages by slicing them lengthways, but not quite through, and grill on both sides until browned, crisp and cooked.</p> <p>Season the lentils and serve with the grilled sausages and 1 tbs of candied fruit chutney in its syrup.</p> <p>Ricotta gnocchi<br>This recipe is from my village, and has many variations and stories attached to it.

When they rise to the top of the pan, skim out into a frying pan.</p> <p>Add the cherry tomatoes, peperoncino and olive oil to the frying pan and saute until the gnocchi are stained with tomato. Serve with torn basil and grated Parmesan.</p> <p><strong>Rocket with pine nuts and pomegranate</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 6</strong></p> <p>2 bunches (approx 300g) rocket leaves (the wild variety is best), washed and dried</p> <p>125g pine nuts</p> <p>125g fresh pomegranate seeds</p> <p>dressing</p> <p>2 tbs red wine vinegar</p> <p>1 tsp any mustard (optional)</p> <p>1 shallot, peeled and minced</p> <p>2 anchovies, crushed</p> <p>2 tbs extra virgin olive oil</p> <p>sea salt and ground black pepper</p> <p>Put the rocket into a large bowl.

Add a little pasta water if a thinner sauce is desired. Serve with extra freshly grated Parmesan if you like.</p> <p><strong>Chicken and roasted pepper soup</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 6</strong></p> <p>This recipe is based on a dish from the Ristorante Solferino in Tuscany, and it uses what they call 'duchese' olive oil. This is made from olives grown on their own land and pressed locally. It is named after a family member, and is of very high quality. Use the best extra virgin oil you can get.</p> <p>12 red peppers</p> <p>10 chicken thighs</p> <p>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p> <p>2 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>1 onion, peeled and chopped</p> <p>2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</p> <p>1.5 litres chicken broth, warm</p> <p>a handful of fresh basil leaves, torn</p> <p>a handful of fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped</p> <p>2 tsp fresh marjoram leaves</p> <p>duchese oil or the best-quality extra virgin olive oil</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F/gas mark 6. Roast the peppers for 25 minutes, then leave to cool. Scrape out the seeds and slice the peppers thinly.<br>At the same time, cook the chicken thighs. Season them with salt and pepper and roast alongside the peppers for 20 minutes, or until cooked through. Cool. </p> <p>Discard the chicken skin and bones and shred the meat finely. Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and saute until golden. Add the strips of peppers and the garlic. Add the broth to the peppers along with the chicken shreds and herbs.

Ladle into warmed soup bowls and serve with some good oil.</p> <p><strong>Butternut squash, mozzarella and caramelised garlic risotto with shallots</strong></p> <p><strong>serves 4</strong></p> <p>This recipe comes from Geltrude Mitterman of Trattoria Bella Vista in Mendola, Alto Adige. It is family-run, very friendly, and very Austrian/Swiss in its interior and approach to its dishes.</p> <p>400g butternut squash</p> <p>olive oil</p> <p>1 small onion, peeled and diced</p> <p>55g unsalted butter</p> <p>200g risotto rice</p> <p>700ml chicken broth, hot</p> <p>55g Parmesan, grated</p> <p>125g buffalo mozzarella, cut into 1cm cubes</p> <p>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p> <p>pesto</p> <p>1 large bunch fresh basil</p> <p>3 garlic cloves, peeled</p> <p>3 tbsp pine nuts, lightly toasted</p> <p>about 3 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>3 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan</p> <p>crispy shallots</p> <p>55g shallots, peeled and finely sliced1</p> <p>115g plain flour, seasoned vegetable oil for frying</p> <p>caramelised garlic</p> <p>16 garlic cloves</p> <p>200ml chicken broth, hot</p> <p>25g unsalted butter</p> <p>First make the pesto. Put the basil, garlic and pine nuts in a food processor with a little salt and pepper. Work to a paste, add enough olive oil to produce a loose-textured puree. Remove from the food processor, pour into a bowl and fold in Parmesan.</p> <p>Next, make the crispy shallots. Dust the shallots in seasoned flour, shake off any excess and deep-fry in vegetable oil at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F). When they are a light golden brown, remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Season with a little salt and keep on a warm plate.</p> <p>To caramelise the garlic, first blanch the garlic in a pan of salted boiling water for about 3 minutes, then peel and transfer to a clean pan. Pour off the water and add the chicken broth and butter. Cook until the garlic is soft and the broth is reduced to a syrup that coats the cloves. Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/gas mark 4.</p> <p>Peel and seed the butternut squash, dice into 1cm cubes and fry in a little olive oil until lightly coloured. Transfer to the oven for 10-12 minutes, until the flesh is tender. Meanwhile, gently sweat the diced onion in the butter until the onion is soft. Add the rice to the onion, raise the heat and cook, stirring, until the rice is shiny and translucent. Lower the heat and begin to add the hot broth, a ladleful at a time, wait for it to be absorbed before adding the next ladleful.</p> <p>Once the rice is cooked to al dente, and of the correct texture, fold in the Parmesan, mozzarella and squash, and cook for 2 minutes more. Season to taste.</p> <p>Serve immediately on hot plates, drizzle the pesto around the risotto and top with a small pile of crisp shallots and caramelised garlic cloves.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Trattoria: Italian Food for Family and Friends by Ursula Ferrigno is published by Mitchell Beazley (\u00a320).

  "<p>Her bullet-riddled body was found last month amid the dense undergrowth of eastern Thailand. Those who stumbled on the blood-soaked carcass described milk still flowing from her breast. The elephant's calf was nowhere to be seen, snatched by her mother's killers along with her valuable tusks. </p> <p>By now the ivory will have found its way to Bangkok, where hundreds of British visitors will have deliberated whether to smuggle it home. It may already be available on the streets of London, home of the UK's flourishing and sophisticated ivory market. </p> <p>In three weeks' time British ministers will arrive in Bangkok for the most crucial talks this year on protecting the planet's wildlife. Yet an Observer investigation reveals the city remains unrivalled as the world's greatest hub for the illegal trade in rare animals. </p> <p>Yet on the eve of the international summit, concern is shifting closer to home. Tens of thousands of Britons and their desire for acquiring anything from snakeskins to tiger pelts to ivory trinkets stand accused of accelerating the slaughter of endangered animals. Their willingness to flout wildlife law has fostered a deep sense of shame among Britain's conservationists. </p> <p>The UK government is also under fire for choosing to remain silent on the scale of Bangkok's trade. Despite receiving a wealth of evidence on the city's role in the smuggling of rare species, ministers have refused publicly to condemn Thailand's failure to quash its slaughter of endangered animals. Some believe Britain should first concentrate on the increasing problems in its own backyard, citing its 'uncontrolled and thriving' ivory market. An investigation for the International Fund for Animal Welfare has identified the UK as the third-biggest source of illegal ivory into the US, one of the world's largest markets. The scale of illegal animal trafficking in Britain is stunning. More than 570 illegal wildlife imports were seized by UK customs officers each day during the most comprehensive analysis of the crisis so far. </p> <p>Environmentalists say the situation is accelerating the fastest extinction of species since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. In Bangkok, evidence suggests it remains as rife as ever. An undercover investigation, yet to be published, by the Dorset-based Monkey World found 38 orang-utans had been smuggled from Thailand into Cambodia over the summer. </p> <p>Director Jim Cronin estimates up to 600 of Asia's only great ape are being kept illegally in Thailand. 'We are talking about the wholesale decimation of the orang-utan by the Thai government. Where has the UK, and the world, been?' said Cronin. </p> <p>Today among the 10,000 stalls of Bangkok's sprawling Chatuchak weekend market, a major draw for British tourists, The Observer was repeatedly told it would be possible to order orang-utans, snow leopards or rare birds by market traders. Similarly sources told Monkey World they could buy an orang-utan for \u00a34,000 but that prices will fall after the spotlight of Thailand's international talks fades. </p> <p>Some Britons will be unable to wait that long. Few, though, are unlikely to match the audacity of Raymond Humphreys, 45. When customs officers opened his suitcase at Heathrow after a flight from Bangkok two years ago, 23 endangered bird species worth \u00a335,000 were found wedged into tight glass tubes. Six had died en route. Later, on top of Humphreys's Norfolk caravan, police came across a present for his wife - a golden-cheeked gibbon, one of less than 1,000 left. </p> <p>A streak of dried blood clung to the inside of the tusk. Viewed from another angle, though, its polished veneer gleamed without blemish: a reminder of why the world's most valuable bone remains craved by so many Britons. This was the finest-quality raw ivory around, hacked from an Asian elephant, each tusk as long as a man's arm and the weight of a six-month-old baby. Unveiled from the dusty backroom of a Bangkok shop last week, the pair were offered to The Observer for \u00a33,500. They came without paperwork and were perfectly illegal. 'I don't care and you don't care; this is ivory,' beamed the proprietor when told of plans to whisk them back to London for sale. His store stood in the centre of the Thai capital, a short cab ride from the huge Queen Sirikit Convention Centre where 5,000 delegates representing more than 160 countries will shortly convene to discuss around 40 proposals on how to improve protection for the most threatened plants and animals. </p> <p>All those about to arrive will know that not only is the elephant the former symbol of Thailand, but it is that of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) too. Yet the host country continues to fail its former icon. </p> <p>Numbers of wild Thai elephants have fallen to fewer than 3,000. Most countries attending will have assumed the killing to have stopped during the run-up to the talks. The fact that ivory can still openly be bought in downtown Bangkok will embarrass figures such as Britain's Environment Minister, Elliot Morley. </p> <p>Of equal concern are the findings of an Observer investigation that has unearthed a trial of corruption, harassment and even death threats as elements within Thailand resist efforts to suppress the trade before the gaze of the world's media arrives. Even the Thai Prime Minister, it has emerged, has come under fierce pressure from the powerful interests that profiteer from the covert smuggling of endangered creatures. </p> <p>Today Thailand's dark secret has become second only to the country's notorious narcotics rings in terms of value. And it is just as dangerous. </p> <p>At first glance, the silver Mazda seen trundling down a dirt track towards the Laos border seemed like just another lost traveller. On closer inspection, highway police noticed the vehicle was carrying a load so heavy its boot sank low above the rear axle. The reason soon became clear. Inside they found the bloody carcass of a huge Bengal tiger sawn clean in half. At 4pm the driver Leuthai Tiewchareun was arrested, by 6pm he was free on bail. </p> <p>Manop Laohapraser - one of Thailand's senior Cites officials and a man whom Morley would expect to meet next month - is reported to have arrived at the scene. Despite his presence, no DNA of the tiger was taken, while a microchip embedded in the creature's neck was never reported, making the tiger's origins impossible to deduce. Yet Leuthai was well-known to the authorities. Undercover investigators had identified him as a major player in an illegal animal smuggling network codenamed Cobra. </p> <p>Last November when police raided his home, it looked more like a zoo. More than 20 pairs of bear paws lay beside piles of fresh tiger meat. His deep-freeze contained the body of a baby orang-utan from Indonesia. Back then, Leuthai had been arrested, but had again jumped his \u00a33,000 bail. </p> <p>Sources say he will be in Bangkok as Morley and the UK delegation touch down for Cites on 2 October. Manop himself is now suspended over his alleged involvement in the sale of 100 Bengal tigers to a Chinese theme park that some believed were destined for human consumption. </p> <p>In addition, evidence collated by WildAid and sent to the Thai authorities reveals that Cobra has links to a police intelligence officer as well as a powerful Thai family. Documents detail the bribes Leuthai's network would pay to Thai border officials such as \u00a3150 for up to 400kg of pangolins, a type of anteater. To date, they provide one of the first insights into the corruption that underpins Bangkok's illegal wildlife network. </p> <p>As profits have grown, so too has the involvement of violent criminals. Even the man appointed to clean up Thailand's illegal trade at the behest of the Prime Minister admits he has been threatened after targeting the biggest players. Major-General Sawake Pinsinchai, head of the Forestry Police, told The Observer: 'There have been several threats in the past. The problem in the past and present is that you are fighting some organisations that are part of a very big network and are very well connected to influential people and politicians.' </p> <p>One prominent conservationist was recently told by a Thai official that he could not even attend Cites. Attempts were even made to discredit Edwin Wiek, who runs the acclaimed Wildlife Rescue Centre in Petchaburi, north of Bangkok. Despite nursing 115 previously sickly and malnourished animals he has been arrested and charged on grounds that have left supporters baffled. Other campaigners have fared far worse. One was recently killed after trying to protect a mangrove swamp from developers. A forestry campaigner was shot dead two weeks ago north of Bangkok. 'I am on the list, by the time you found out how high up you are it's too late', one told The Observer last week in the safety of a guarded hotel. </p> <p>Steven Galster, director of Thailand's WildAid, said: 'People get killed around here for a lot less.' More than 240 wildlife dealers, some with suspected connections to corrupt police and border officials are thought to operate out of Bangkok into neighbouring countries. Leuthai's network covers the whole of south-east Asia and relies on Thailand's 1,800 miles of porous borders. Three hours' drive east from Bangkok lies Cambodia and the region of Pailin, a favoured animal smuggling route. So far this year eight people monitoring the Cambodian side have been killed. Some manage to survive ferocious machete attacks. One man recently required 74 stitches. </p> <p>Such murders are safeguarding a system that involves single shipments into Bangkok worth \u00a36 million. Single cargos of 3,000 pangolins and 600 macaws have been found. Figures passed to the Thai authorities reveal \u00a31.6m of illegal wildlife passed through the city in the six months up to March. </p> <p>'As a trading centre Bangkok is just phenomenal, yet we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg,' said Lincolnshire-born Tim Redford of WildAid, who admits he kept his 'head down' for years while investigating the trade. The level of seeming co-operation between criminals and officials continues to infuriate the country's fledgling environmental movement. </p> <p>A common complaint involves the practice of raids on suspect smugglers being called off at the last minute after a tip-off. Equally important is the dealers' ability to operate with impunity. Hundreds have been arrested, but all, like Leuthai, remain free. No one has received the maximum four years in jail. Yet those like Sawake believe they are starting to make a difference. In just one month 198,465 animals, including tigers and bears, were seized in 656 separate shipments. </p> <p>Deep within the endless suburbs of Bangkok, Safari World has found little trouble luring thousands of UK tourists over the years. A firm favourite among British families are the orang-utans forced to wear garish costumes as they mimic Thai boxers. This week, however, the zoo will find itself at the centre of a storm of international outrage that threatens to cast a shadow over the country's hosting of Cites. A year ago the Thai embassy in London received strong evidence that the orang-utans had been smuggled illegally from Indonesia. Sawake ordered an investigation. The zoo owners replied that they had bred the animals and although they once had 110 of the prized apes 41 had been cremated after falling ill. Their claims were rejected. </p> <p>Finally, police raided the centre and found the remaining creatures. They had been hidden in another part of the zoo. Eight days ago the zoo's vet was convicted of lying to the police. The Indonesian authorities are demanding the creatures be handed back. </p> <p>However, a letter seen by The Observer from the director general of Thailand's department for national parks suddenly claims that they would be suspending action against the owners of Safari World. For conservationists hoping for a symbolic victory against wildlife traders it was a major blow. For Sawake it beggared belief. 'If I am asked to drop the case then you better ask someone else to take over,' he said yesterday. There are increasing signs the British government, whose attempts on tackling wildlife crime are ranked among the best in the world, may raise the issue with the Thai authorities this month. Though for many of the world's most precious creatures it will be too late.</p>",
  "<p>We all undervalue what we are good at. We all want to be admired for those things that we ourselves admire and which seem difficult and remote from us. I am good at growing things and waffling. But to explain the universe without religion, mysticism or astrology seems an astonishing thing to me. I studied a grand total of four terms of science in my 15 years of education and never understood anything past day three. As a result my brain is not cluttered with things like elements or formulae or accurate measurements of any kind. </p> <p>If you hadn't guessed it by now, this is all a preamble to a bit of science. You probably learnt it at your mother's breast but indulge me. It is the legume's trick of taking nitrogen from the air and I think it a miracle. Here is the magic.</p> <p>Nitrogen - which is essential for any plant growth - makes up around 80 per cent of the atmosphere, but it is in a form that plants cannot easily absorb. But rhizobium bacteria are able to convert it into a useable form by splitting nitrogen molecules and using the atoms to build nitrates or ammonia compounds that can then be used by plants. It has been estimated that the amount of nitrogen fixed by such bacteria globally is 110 million tonnes per year. The relationship is symbiotic because in return the plant gives the bacteria protection and sugars. The bacteria live in little white nodules on the roots of all leguminous plants - which includes peas and beans in the kitchen garden, lupins in the border and clover in the lawn. When the plant dies down and decomposes, there is always a residual amount of fixed nitrogen left in the soil which the plant has not used but is available to other plants, hence the reason that brassicas - which need plenty of nitrogen for their leafy growth, especially when they are young - follow peas and beans in a crop rotation plan. They hoover up the leftover nitrogen processed from the atmosphere by the legumes. </p> <p>Now it follows that with intelligent use of nitrogen-fixing legumes, you never need to add nitrogen to the soil. No nitrates means an instant reduction of river pollution, ill-health, and the array of pests and disease caused by the soft, sappy growth instigated by overuse of nitrogen. It means that you work on creating a healthy soil that feeds its plants rather than pumping sick earth with chemical resuscitation just to get you through to the next crisis. This is something that organic farmers have always known and that any vegetable gardener has always practised as part of their crop rotation. Legumes first, brassicas second and roots third before manuring the ground again and going back to legumes. If you do not grow peas or beans then there are green manures such as alfafa, field beans, fenugreek, winter tares and trefoil as well as the various clovers which will all fix nitrogen, suppress weeds and provide organic material to be dug directly into the ground or cut and added to the compost heap. All in all it is hugely beneficial.</p> <p>But if you have an allotment or vegetable patch, it is likely that you will grow some peas and beans. Right now in the garden, the French and runner beans are at their best. French beans (which are not remotely French, coming, as do runner beans, from central and south America) are Phaseolus vulgaris and include haricot beans, kidney beans, dwarf, pole, yellow, green, purple and blotchy ones. They have been grown in this country since at least the mid-16th century but only as climbing beans until the 18th century. French beans have variable pods, ranging from leathery shells that crack open to reveal the glossy beans inside, via the soft and edible immature pods to bootlace-thin beans that are half-vegetable and half-garnish. I have grown 'Roquencourt' and 'Purple Queen' this year and if we keep picking them they will go on flowering and therefore producing pods into October. I sow them in blocks, a hand's-span apart, pushing each bean into the finger-soft soil. It's all scientific. </p> <p>All my climbing beans this year are 'Borlotti' which we pick when the pods crack and then store them in Kilner jars over the winter. They will keep like that for at least a year and what we don't eat I use for next year's seed. </p> <p>I have never really understood the overwhelming national preference for runner beans over climbing French ones. In the recent Mori poll commissioned by the RHS on our vegetable growing habits, they came in a close third after potatoes and tomatoes, followed by a huge drop down to the remaining range of veg. But my problem with them is that a little of them goes an awful long way. They come from Mexico and were originally raised just for their flowers - much as we now grow a clematis. They are undeniably beautiful growing in wigwams or rows of hazel beansticks braced and tented like sculpture in a thousand allotment sites across the country. They like cool, wet weather but warm soil. The great secret of sowing French or runner beans is to wait until the soil - and the nights - are warm, even if that means not sowing until well into July. And they must have moisture. So if you are a bean, hurray for this summer's rain.</p> <p>In a month's time I shall sow the first of next year's broad beans - probably 'Aquadulce'. These will germinate, grow an inch or two and then stop until early spring. They are vulnerable to slugs, mice and extreme weather during this period, but if they pull through they will give a picking a full three weeks ahead of the first spring sowing and also avoid any blackfly. Broad beans must be eaten small or else they become doughy lumps of paste in the mouth, so three or four small sowings that can be harvested in succession is much better than one big show-off crop. Double rows spaced 18in apart with 9in between each bean seems to work best, especially as a spine down the centre of a raised bed with lettuces planted round the edge. 'Red Epicure' have wonderful red flowers and beans which disappointingly turn green when cooked. They cross with white-flowering beans and always revert to white, so grow them well apart if you intend to keep the seed. </p> <p>Blackfly don't look good but are not really a problem. Just pinch out the growing tips when you first see them. </p> <p>Finally peas. I have trouble with peas. I used to just pop them in the ground, they germinated, I put in pea sticks, they grew, we picked and ate, and everybody was happy. But the seeds have a tendency to rot if too wet and mice love them. Slugs will rip through the emerging plants like a slimy combine harvester and cold weather stops them in their tracks - as does drought and hot weather. But it is worth persevering. I made three sowings this year, in March, April and the end of May. </p> <p>'Douce Provence' (early), 'Hurst Greenshaft' (maincrop) and 'Carouby de Maussane' which are a mangetout. All did badly, with very patchy germination but enough came through to create great ripples of pleasure. I like to sow a double row 9in apart with the peas spaced along the rows at half that distance. Pea sticks are much more beautiful as a support than netting or wire and pushing them into soft spring soil is a celebration in itself. But, they are hard to find.</p>",
  "<p>It's a hot day deep in a green Gloucestershire village. </p> <p>Andrew and Helen Baillie are in their cottage, talking to me, while also listening to the computer in the next room which lets out regular alerts - soft electronic sighs - which mean, each time, that someone else is joining their website. Each new member is searching for their mother, father, son or daughter. They have logged in their details, then written a personal message which will only be made available if the intended recipient also registers.</p> <p> We go to the computer to see what has come in. These notes have been written moments before, some in secret, some using school email addresses, then sent into cyberspace. Many are angry and emotional, packed with hope and hurt, while others seem simply curious.</p> <p>'If u see this, please get in contact. It's really hard living life without a father figure, and I forgive you fully for leaving my mum on her own when she was 18,' says the first. 'Hi Dad, I just thought I'd let you know I was getting married,' reads the next. The third is a mother to her son: 'I have been trying to find you since you turned 18. A day has not gone by where I haven't thought about you. I would really love to meet you and explain what happened all those years ago. Please get in touch.'</p> <p>Andrew Baillie, 39 and an engineer, first thought of the website last year, but it's taken this long to get it off the ground and working well. Now, with almost no advertising or publicity, he is planning to give up his career and manage it full time. 'It's taking over our lives,' he says. 'I'm waking up at 5am, going downstairs to a mountain of emails, and coming home from work to more. I'm at my computer every evening until midnight. We've got three children and Helen works nights as a care worker ... We're getting very tired.'</p> <p>In some ways, his website, www.findaparentorchild.com, is simply one of many to appear online in recent years, each with the potential to do for families what friendsreunited.com did for friends. If missing-you.net was the first, launched in March 1998, there is now also genesreunited.co.uk, myfolks.co.uk and lookupuk.com, all with thousands upon thousands of subscribers. However, most cover a far broader spectrum than the Baillies'. They can be used to trace family trees, to find information on ancestors or to seek out aunts, uncles, half-siblings and lost cousins. Their message boards can be read by anyone who logs on, and most are general appeals for information. Findaparentorchild is specific and single purposed. It's for parents and children only, and their messages can't be accessed unless they meet a match. 'I don't know how much if anything you remember about me. </p> <p>I want to answer any questions that you might want answering. Please get in touch,' says a father to his son. 'You shagged my mum!' says a son to his father. These are stories of divorce, desertion, adoption, affairs and one-night stands. In modern Britain, the potential for a site like this is clearly enormous.</p> <p>But for the Baillies, this project is more than a business, it's also personal. Andrew's parents are divorced and he hasn't seen his dad since he was 16. His wife Helen, 40, was adopted as a baby and reunited with her birth mother 26 years later, after an exhausting four-year search.</p> <p>'When my dad left, I was 16 - and at that age, you tend to pick a side,' says Andrew. 'Things were very hostile between my parents and I was angry for a long time. Now, at 39, I obviously have a different outlook and I realise there are two sides to every story. I don't blame him any more. But if my dad is out there, he may be worried that I'm still angry, or perhaps he doesn't know what to say to me. He may want to contact me but doesn't know whether or how to go about it, so here is a facility where we could both test the water. It's noncommittal: we don't have to meet up, we don't even have to call each other. All we have to do is send an email and see what happens.'</p> <p>Helen is equally certain that one nationally known website could have saved her years of time and longing. 'When I was eight, my parents sat me down and told me I was adopted,' she says. 'They told me they couldn't have children, but wanted children, so they chose me, and I was extra special.</p> <p>'But from that moment on, I felt ... unwanted. I shut out my adoptive parents and felt very angry towards my birth mother. Why didn't she want me? What was wrong with me?'</p> <p>The fact that Helen's adoptive mother was extremely ill with diabetes compounded Helen's confusion. 'I had to go to my grandparents for a month because my mum lost a leg and, from then on, I was always shunted around to relatives. My mum lost her second leg, then started to go blind. She was suffering and angry and said some horrible things. She didn't mean them, but we had terrible rows. It sounds awful, but I wanted a normal mother. As a teenager, I felt I didn't belong in that family and I wanted to find my real family.'</p> <p>When Helen left home at 19, she began her search, which involved accessing her adoption papers, knocking on doors, talking to neighbours, writing to a retired headmaster, and finally finding her mother's address on the Suffolk coast. With the help of social services, Helen wrote a coded letter.</p> <p>By this stage, her birth mother, Jenny, was 42 and married. Helen had been born when Jenny was 16, the result of a relationship with a lorry driver, married and 10 years her senior. Helen's mother had been sent away to stay with an aunt in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, where she gave birth to Helen, handed her over for adoption, then returned home to her old life. She'd kept it all secret, but on receiving Helen's letter, she told her husband and their daughter, and Helen was welcomed in one of those tearful, textbook-TV type reunions.</p> <p>Helen's adoptive mother died a month later, and never knew of Helen's search or her find. 'I don't have a mother/daughter relationship with my birth mother,' says Helen. 'It's not the relationship I'd have if my mum was still alive - but it's still important. When she was sent away by her parents, she was told she could go home without me or never go back at all. That was the only choice she was given. All my life, I wanted to understand why she gave me up - and now I have the answers.'</p> <p>Unfortunately, many family break-ups won't have such nice, neat endings. Until recently, social services have shrouded adoptions in secrecy, studding them with safeguards. While adoptees can only apply for information about their birth parents when they reach 18, at present, birth parents have no rights at all to know about the children they signed away. However, from September next year, those whose children were adopted before 1975 can go to registered adoption support agencies to request that an intermediary approaches their children on their behalf. In theory, information is provided slowly, step by step, with counselling, protection and preparation.</p> <p>Now along comes the internet, which has the power to bypass this altogether with its DIY instant access. Not surprisingly, adoption agencies are more than a little concerned. Norcap (the National Organisation for the Counselling of Adoptees and Parents) strongly disapproves of online message boards.</p> <p>'If you are a mother who had a baby in the Sixties, have since married, had children and never told anyone, these sites can blow your life out of the water,' says Ann Caffari, Norcap's specialist services co-ordinator. 'Half the time, it's their children who see it first. They are messing around and put in their mother's maiden name and boom, there it is.'</p> <p>Perhaps more worrying is the large number of under-18s using findaparentorchild, some of whom are looking for birth parents. Sue Seabrook, head of adoption with the Children's Society, explains why adoption is now 'a whole different ball game'. 'Adoption used to involve families where the worst thing that ever happened was that someone got pregnant without being married,' she says. 'In the Eighties, that changed. Children are adopted because of care orders, usually because some seriously horrible things have happened in that family. The children were sexually abused by their father, or locked in a room by their mother. Or their father's in prison and their mother's a drug addict.</p> <p>'When these children want to be reunited, we can carefully manage things, give them information, see how the land lies. There can be phone calls or letters which are exchanged without passing on addresses. It requires a huge amount of professionalism and understanding. These websites are often started by people who've been reunited in an old-style adoption and they're on a crusade. They don't have any idea of the people they could be putting together. I find them incredibly dodgy.'</p> <p>Some of the postings do read as 'incredibly dodgy', and you can almost sense the suffering ahead. One (from a 20-year-old) says simply, 'I suffered 46 per cent burns on 23/12/85 when I was two and was adopted in 1989.' Is Andrew right to accept such messages? He doesn't appear to have any doubts. 'Every child has every right to know their parents if they want to,' he says. 'I have to be open-minded.' Right on cue, his computer lets out another soft bleep, so we go to see. </p> <p>It's an adoption from the Eighties. The girl was born in Blackpool, adopted at eight months and is looking for her birth mother. 'You gave me a metal money box in the shape of a duck with a pink scarf on,' she says. We 'Ahhh' at the idea of this cherished duck, then Andrew adds: 'Now are you asking me if I think she should have the right to find her birth mother? You bet I do.' He approves that message with a click of his mouse and off it flies, to wait, in hope, with all the others. </p> <p><strong>Dawn Johnson 42, lives in Wellingborough, with her second husband and their three children</strong><br>'Louise, Karl and Kurt. I kept waiting, hoping you may find me. Every day, my head is full of whats and whys. </p> <p>I can understand everything you went through. My life was filled with children's homes and foster parents. </p> <p>I understand if you've never wanted to know or see me, but all I wish is to know you're OK. I never, ever stopped thinking about you all. If I hadn't been in that bloody hospital for so long and if I'd had a family to help me, this would never have happened. I love you all and my heart will remain with you forever. I'm here if you ever want or need to see me. Forever, always - Your mum, Dawn'</p> <p>'I'm scared of seeing them because I let them down. It's my fault, of course it is, but I had no one. I didn't even know what a family was. Really, I don't know what I'd say to them. I think I'd let them ask me. My dad was extremely violent. </p> <p>My mum never smacked us, but she drank a lot. When I was 10, my mum ran off. Dad didn't want us, and me and my younger sister went into care, to a big children's home near Southampton. I remember my mum finally visiting when I was 14 - it took her four years. It was Christmas and she brought me 200 cigarettes. I didn't even smoke then, so I put them under my bed. Imagine it: 200 cigarettes. </p> <p>When I was 16, I ran away with the fair. I met this guy, Dave Jenkins, five years older, who worked on the dodgems. Looking back, I wasn't really in love with him. I didn't even know what love was because I'd had no one to show me. It was just someone for me, somewhere to stay. We slept in his bright yellow trailer - we called it a 'kip truck'. When the season ended, I followed him to his parents' house in Nuneaton. We got married when I was 17 and Dave worked as a bouncer. I had a job at a Supersave and worked in a bar at night.</p> <p>Louise, the first, was born in 1982. She was quite chunky, walking at nine months. She had huge hair, a massive mop. She was strong willed, quite bubbly - a lot like me, really. Then we had Karl. Blue-eyed, skinny. He was lovely. Then Kurt. You should never have favourites, should you? But he was a mummy's boy. If I left him to go anywhere or try and do anything, he'd hold on to my ankles. He was my baby. </p> <p>Dave and I split up. He found another woman who didn't want my children around. By now Dave's mum had died and his dad was a drinker, so I was on my own. I had a bit of a nervous breakdown, though I didn't know what that was at the time. I just couldn't think, you can't even think. Eventually, I got a visit from social services and we agreed that the children could stay with a foster family while I had a break. The foster mother was a lovely woman and it wasn't far away. Dave and I took it in turns to have the children every weekend. It was only temporary. I was working in Doncaster at the time, travelling back to Nuneaton in the evenings. </p> <p>Then, when I was down there, I was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary with kidney stones. </p> <p>I was stuck there for ages, in really bad pain. I've still got a massive scar round the side of my body. Dave wasn't on the phone, and I didn't let him know. When I went back to Nuneaton, everyone was so surprised to see me. They thought I'd gone for good. Dave thought I'd died. I probably should have. The children were gone. Dave had signed them over for adoption. I remember a social worker chasing me down the road trying to get me to sign the papers, too. I never did. </p> <p>All Dave could tell me was that he thought they were in Rugby. The times I drove round Rugby, just round and round. I put notices in shop windows there. 'Does Anyone Know These Children?' My life was a mess then, but it isn't now. I am now married to Peter. I'm in love with him, it's totally different. We've had three children. Tamara is 12, Shannen's 11 and Perrin is eight. They're wonderful. At first, I felt that I didn't deserve them, that I'd cheated on my other children. You shouldn't have more children if you can't keep yours with you. I think about my first three all the time. I've had this computer three years and registered on every site going, gone into chatrooms where 20-year-olds might be, and looked for their names, or asked, 'Does anyone live in Rugby?'</p> <p>I've visited so many websites, looked at colleges, their lists of graduates. The trouble is, I don't know their last name. Sometimes I see people walk past the house and I think: Is it them? Or I see someone on the bus who looks like them. I imagine they're watching me, checking me out. Their birthdays are the worst. </p> <p>Louise's is the day after mine. Tamara is 12 going on 32 - she's smart - and the other day, she said, 'Mum, why are you wasting your time? They're not looking for you. You're making yourself upset for nothing.' It made me think, really, and I got quite upset. But whenever I feel like giving up, Peter keeps me going. He says if I stop, I'll regret it. So I just keep trying.' </p> <p><strong>Stephen Thornhill</strong><br>25, lives in Birmingham and is a police officer</p> <p>'My mother married my godfather and my real father has not been around, as far as I know, since I was born. All I know is his name, David Robinson, and the fact that he was in the Royal Navy in 1979'</p> <p>'I'd always known my dad was actually my stepdad. He'd originally been my godfather and Mum married him when I was four. He took me on 100 per cent - he's one of those nice guys - and they had two more children. For a long time, it was just quite a nice thing, to feel a bit different from everybody else. I didn't start asking questions until I was 14. I was going on a school trip to France and needed a passport. To get one, I had to use my real dad's name, Robinson, because that was on my birth certificate. I hadn't yet changed it by deed poll. I started asking Mum who my dad was, but she doesn't like talking about it. I don't want to slate my mum - she's got her reasons. It's a part of her life she doesn't want to remember, but I'm not happy about it. All Mum will say is that yes, she was married to him, but she can't remember what he was like, what he looked like. There must be photos, but I've never seen any. For a long time, I put it to the back of my mind. I had other things to think about, like joining the cadets, then the police. </p> <p>Occasionally, it reared its head. On the police application form, you're asked if any family members have criminal convictions, so I gave the little information I had. </p> <p>Now I'm self-sufficient, I've made my own life and I feel I can look. I'm not looking for a father, but I just want to know. My brother and sister have turned into the spit of my stepdad. What does my dad look like? Am I going to go bald before I'm 30? Who is he? What happened? Where did it all go? </p> <p>A couple of years ago, I asked my nan, my mum's mum, who's extremely astute. She said, \"I've been waiting for that for years. I'm surprised you haven't asked sooner.\" It was quite emotional, because in five minutes she told me more than I'd ever found out in my whole life. She said he was a very nice guy and I look very similar to him. He came from Cheshire and joined the navy, and lived with Mum in Portsmouth. She said Mum and him were never suited. I wrote to the navy and they confirmed he was on their records, now retired. They offered to forward a letter, so I wrote one, keeping it fairly factual. I never received a reply. It could mean he's not interested, that he has moved on, or died. </p> <p>It's sporadic. I'll go six months without doing anything, then I'll have a three-month burst and do everything possible. It's difficult because there are so many David Robinsons and I don't have a location or date of birth. I don't want to push him into a situation he doesn't want. He may have remarried and not told his wife. He may have children. Would they want to get to know me? They probably wouldn't. I think what I'd like is a conversation. I've only heard one side of the story, and very little of that. I'm not angry or upset - purely interested in the answers. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be hurt if he wanted nothing to do with me. But I'm old enough to take it.'</p> <p><strong>Cathie Hutchins</strong><br>42, lives in Cheltenham and is married with five children</p> <p>'I was born in Epping. I have had a wonderful life but would love to meet my birth mother at least once to say thank you. I do not wish to disrupt her life now, I just need to fill the gaps'</p> <p>'One of the reasons I want to find my birth mother is to say thank you. She was 19 when she had me, and I look at my 19-year-old and think: \"My God, you couldn't cope.\" There's no way he's ready to be a parent. My birth mum could have aborted me, or left me on a doorstep. She didn't. She looked after me for six weeks, then did what she thought was right, and gave me for adoption. It must have taken a lot of courage, and I want her to know that I couldn't have gone to a better home. My adoptive parents were fantastic, you can't fault them. They were loving and giving, and supported me in whatever I did. My mum helps with my children, she's everything a mum is. She is my mum, there's no doubt about it. My birth mother is my birth mother but my mum is my mum. </p> <p>I don't want to hurt her. This search isn't a reflection of anything Mum lacked. I'd always known I was adopted, but didn't think about it too much until my teens. Then I started looking at my friends and noticing they looked like their parents. Family resemblances: I find them quite hard. There's also this strange feeling that there's something more to my life and I don't know anything about it. My parents told me what they knew, which wasn't much, so at 18 I went to the Crusade of Rescue, the Catholic adoption society that handled my adoption. They asked why I wanted to know - that probably passed for counselling in those days - then gave me a one-page document. It said that I'd been born as 'Celia Donnelly'. My mother was born in Preston to Irish parents, who both died when she was three. She was brought up in a convent in Ireland, then returned to England and worked as a children's nurse. She met my father at a party - he was Irish, too, an ice-cream packer. They had no plans to marry. </p> <p>At that time, I felt I didn't need to know more. Then I had my first child and it stirred up quite a lot. I remember vividly, sitting in the hospital, looking at my newborn son, thinking it must be awful to go through this and know you can't keep the baby.</p> <p>I find it hard when I hear people criticising their birth mothers. We've no idea what they went through. We can't judge. Every now and again, it would surface - I'd wonder what she's doing. She doesn't know these children are here - things like that. Then my daughter Lauren was born with cystic fibrosis. For things like that, it would be useful to know your genetic history. I wrote to the Crusade of Rescue again, and finally they sent the whole file to my local social services, who talked to me, then left me with the papers. It was the paperwork my mum had filled in to give me over. It was amazing to see her handwriting, to hold something she had actually signed. I found it very upsetting. I know how unmarried Irish women were treated. I found the form almost derogatory to my mother. It refers to the 'putative father' - as if they haven't accepted her word for who he is. It's cold, too. I imagine she was made to feel like nothing when she was doing something courageous. </p> <p>I've tried to apply for a copy of her birth certificate, but there's no one of her name born near Preston. I tried to trace the convent where she grew up, but that drew a blank. Then I get torn because I don't want to rock the boat for her. </p> <p>I don't feel I have any 'rights'. The 'rights' are on her side. </p> <p>I don't need another mum, because I have a mum. But if you put yourself in her situation and imagine giving your baby away, do you think you could just switch off and never, ever think about that child growing up? Surely she must think: I hope it's all right, I hope she's happy and healthy. Well, I'd like her to know I'm fine, my kids are lovely and what she did was right. Her life looked as if it was really hard and I'd like to see that things were OK for her, too. That would be enough for me.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http:/www.findaparentorchild.co.uk\">www.findaparentorchild.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>I recently visited Zahle, the world capital of the Arab mezze. Many of my relatives in Egypt had been regular visitors to the mountain resort in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and they always came back with fantastic stories of the unending assortments of mezze they were offered. Zahle has since acquired a mythical reputation for gastronomy and some of its local dishes have come to represent the standard menu of Lebanese restaurants around the world. </p> <p>This is how it happened: the drinking of arak, the anis-flavoured spirit, is behind the philosophy and practice of the mezze tradition, and it is produced in Zahle, where the main Lebanese wines are also produced. The mezze tradition, a national institution that represents a convivial art of living, developed as a way of soaking up the powerful drink, affectionately called 'lion's milk' because it turns cloudy when water and ice are added. In 1920 the first two cafes opened by the river. They gave away nuts, seeds, olives, bits of cheese with the arak. Gradually, the entire valley became filled with open-air cafes, each larger and more luxurious than the next. </p> <p>I was taken to the Bekaa Valley by Kamal Mouzawak - food writer and TV chef who is the local co-ordinator of the Slow Food movement - and his fashion designer partner, Rabih Kayrouz. We were there for a wedding party near the ancient city of Baalbek (it was garlanded with Hesbollah flags). Nadim Khattar, a London-based architect, and Andrea Kowalski, a Venezuelan working at the BBC, had organised a feast in a field in the middle of the countryside for their guests who came from all over the world (Fergus Henderson of St John's restaurant was there). The lunch went on for hours as little dish upon little dish arrived at the tables, each more exquisite than the other. </p> <p>The wedding party continued for two days. </p> <p>I returned with the Hendersons and we stopped for lunch in Zahle. Celebrations continued in Beirut. I came back to London vowing to adopt the mezze habit - the spirit as well as the dishes.</p> <p><strong>Baked kibbeh with onion and pine nut topping</strong></p> <p>This kibbeh has one layer of kibbeh and a delicious onion and pine nut topping. Serves 6 to 12.</p> <p><strong>125g fine ground bulgur<br>1 medium onion, quartered<br>500g lean lamb<br>3/4 tsp salt<br>1 tsp cinnamon<br>2 tbsp vegetable oil</strong></p> <p><strong>for the topping:</strong><strong><br>500g onions, sliced<br>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br>50g pine nuts<br>3/4 tsp ground cinnamon<br>pinch of ground allspice<br>3/4-1 tbsp pomegranate molasses (optional)</strong></p> <p>For the kibbeh, rinse the bulgur in a fine sieve under cold running water; drain well. Puree the onion in a processor. Add the lamb, salt, pepper and cinnamon, and blend to a paste. Add the bulgur and blend to a smooth soft paste. With your hand, press the paste in the bottom of an oiled, round, shallow baking dish, about 11cm in diameter. Flatten the top and rub with the oil. With a pointed knife, cut into 6 wedges through the centre, and run the knife round the edges of the dish. Bake in a preheated oven, 190C/gas mark 5, for 30 minutes until browned.</p> <p>For the topping, fry the onion in olive oil till golden brown. Add pine nuts and stir until lightly coloured. Add salt and pepper, cinnamon and allspice and, if you like a slightly sweet and sour flavour, the pomegranate molasses. Cook for a minute or so. Serve the kibbeh hot or cold (I like it hot) with the topping.</p> <p><strong>Aubergine slices with pomegranate, yogurt and tahini</strong></p> <p>The dressing of pomegranate molasses and vinegar gives the aubergine slices a sweet and sour flavour.

Make a ball out of the off-cuts, roll this out and make 2 more rounds. Put the 8 rounds in a pile and wrap in cling film. Do the same with the remaining pastry. </p> <p>For the filling, blend the mozzarella in the food processor; mash the feta cheese with a fork and mix them well together in a bowl, then mix in the eggs. </p> <p>Put a tbsp of the filling on one half of each round of pastry. Slightly dampen the pastry edges (to make them stick better), then fold the pastry over the filling to make a half-moon shape. Seal the pies by pinching the edges very firmly together. A traditional way is to finish by twisting the edges, making a scalloped effect; another is to press down with the prongs of a fork. </p> <p>Put the pies on sheets of foil in baking trays.

  "<p> <strong> Memoirs of a Gnostic Dwarf <br> by David Madsen</strong> <br> Dedalus \u00a38.99, pp336 </p> <p> First published in 1995, it has taken years for this historical novel to gain the recognition it deserves. Set in the 16th century, it is narrated by a dwarf who has risen from humble beginnings to become Pope Leo X's most intimate confidant - but is secretly a gnostic. The narrative is propelled by an original imaginative energy and a beguiling, though sometimes, wearying mix of bawdiness and erudition: circus freaks, heretics and hunchbacks leap off pages that are also peppered with fragments of gnostic liturgies. Madsen warns us that his tale is 'somewhat salacious', and Leo's sexual and political proclivities are a far cry from his more familiar image as cultivated patron of Michelangelo. If you think Madsen can't get any more outrageous, try his second novel, The Confessions of a Flesh-Eater (1997), the tale of a gourmet's cannibalism</p> <p> <strong> The Fountain at the Centre of the World <br> by Robert Newman</strong> <br> Verso \u00a37.99, pp342 </p> <p> Chano Salgado wonders if the fountain in his local cafe might be responding minutely to everything going on everywhere in the world. The plot of this ambitious anti-globalisation novel shows how the global shudders through the minutiae of individual lives. Chano, a Mexican political dissident, is on the run after being persuaded to blow up a corporation's life-sapping pipelines. His wife has been shot by militia for attending a political meeting, and his long-lost brother, a PR executive for the corporations responsible for Chano's oppression, is dying of a beetle-borne disease and travelling to Mexico in search of a bone-marrow match. Although his characters sometimes spout too many sermons and despite some rather laboured symbolism, Robert Newman's third novel is as funny as it is serious, as it travels from London to Seattle's WTO street demonstrations. At the fringes of society, Newman gathers these scattered people together with considerable skill and poignancy. </p> <p> <strong> Dead Girls <br> by Nancy Lee</strong> <br> Faber \u00a37.99, pp306 </p> <p> Nightmarish television news crackles through the eight stories in Canadian author Nancy Lee's debut collection, telling of the dead prostitutes whose bones are unearthed in the backyard of a retired dentist in Vancouver. In the title story, the news besieges a woman who hasn't heard from her missing daughter for more than a year and who is broken with anxiety. With subtlety, sensuousness and surprising humour, Lee's fragmentary tales of women regarded as expendable explore emotional dislocation and the confused contours between living and dead in a haunting second-person singular - 'Your own skin seems to blur into the air around you, wash into the sheets.' They tell of relationships destroyed by too much intimacy, troubled by too much human touch: 'You worry about the dense scrub of relationship, an overgrowth of tenderness.' Lee keeps control of a high-pitched pain as she shows the disturbing speed at which affection can edge into brutality. </p>",
  "<p>The Caribbean nation of Jamaica became the second major victim of Hurricane Ivan yesterday as waves the height of two-storey houses and 155mph winds smashed into the island. </p> <p>The storm, which has already brought destruction to Grenada - and is forecast next to strike the Cayman Islands, Cuba, then southern Florida - slammed into Jamaica early yesterday. Ivan, the third west Atlantic hurricane this year, is of such severity that weather experts believe this may now be the worst season since 1964. </p> <p>As first reports of fatalities in Jamaica began to filter out, the US National Hurricane Centre described Ivan as 'an extremely dangerous storm' and warned it could intensify again after crossing Jamaica, recovering the extremely rare Category 5 status, the most severe hurricane level, which it held when it hit Grenada. </p> <p>Jamaica's RJR Radio reported that a 10-year-old girl and a woman were killed. The two confirmed deaths raised the toll from Ivan to 39 dead, most in devastated Grenada. It was expected to rise still further. Even before the hurricane, moving at a ground speed of 8mph, slowly tracked off Jamaica's southern coastline, overflowing rivers had washed away homes, flooded low-lying areas and uprooted trees and telegraph poles. </p> <p>As Friday night fell, it brought widespread power cuts and reports of looting and gunfire in some areas of the capital, Kingston. The main highway leading to the eastern part of the island was also cut by flooding. </p> <p>While the eye of the hurricane itself just missed the nation of 2.7 million, meteorologists estimated that Jamaica would be affected by a central core of the strongest gusts, 60 miles across. According to the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami, Ivan's eye 'wobbled toward the west' bringing it within 35 miles of Kingston but keeping it off the island itself. Even before the hurricane hit Jamaica, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson declared a 'period of public emergency' in a radio address to the nation, ordering almost a fifth of the population to quit their homes. 'It is clear that the severity of this hurricane will have extremely serious effects,' he said. 'Flooding has already begun in some places.' </p> <p>Many residents refused to leave home, fearful of a repeat of the looting that occurred after Hurricane Gilbert hit Jamaica in 1988. That hurricane - a lower Category 3 storm - left dozens dead. </p> <p>'I'm not saying I'm not afraid for my life but we've got to stay here and protect our things,' said Lorna Brown, pointing to a stove, television, cooking utensils and large bed crowded into a one-room concrete home on the beach at Montego Bay. </p> <p>Hundreds of British tourists were also trapped by the storm, having turned down the chance to leave the island. Frances Tuke, spokeswoman for the Association of British Travel Agents, said there had been about 3,500 package tourists in Jamaica. About 2,600 were airlifted to safety in the Dominican Republic but about 850 chose to stay. She said a further 25 British holidaymakers were in Grand Cayman and plans were being made to evacuate them. </p> <p>Among the few accounts to have emerged yesterday from Jamaica was via Jennifer Rodney, 48, from north London. She spoke to her mother Myrtle in Spanish Town, St Catherine, in the south-east of Jamaica. She said: 'My mother said the rain was very heavy and the winds were making a terrible noise. Trees have been blown down and she can hear things going past as they are ripped up.' </p> <p>'The whole island is without electricity,' said Joseph Robinson, aged 45, from the British Caribbean territory of Turks and Caicos, as he took shelter in the lobby of a Kingston hotel. 'It's going beyond manageable.' </p> <p>But even as Ivan pounded a Jamaica largely cut off from the outside world, emergency preparations were under way in its next likely targets, as the US National Hurricane Centre advised that Ivan's most likely route would bring it over the Keys and into the eastern Gulf of Mexico late today or early tomorrow after crossing the Caymans and Cuba. </p> <p>Residents of all three Cayman islands, which are home to about 45,000 people and a key offshore financial centre, were urged to prepare 'as for direct impact'. </p> <p>The authorities told coastal dwellers to flee battering waves and an 8ft storm surge. 'All three islands must therefore be prepared for the worst-case scenario,' said Donovan Ebanks, the deputy chairman of the National Hurricane Committee. </p> <p>Cuba declared a hurricane watch on Friday after its leader, Fidel Castro, told residents to brace themselves. 'Whatever the hurricane does, we will all work together' to rebuild, he said. </p> <p>In Florida - still reeling from two hurricanes in the past month which caused upwards of $20 billion in damage, and where 650,000 residents still remain without power - a widespread evacuation was ordered of the Florida Keys. </p> <p>Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and warned that the state faced 'yet another catastrophic disaster'. Forecasters said Ivan could tear through the Keys as early as tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>The news that Tony Blair will this week reinforce Britain's commitment to the fight global warming is timely. The omens of climate change have never been so striking or alarming. After a British summer of rain and ruined harvests, and of disappearing polar ice-caps and rising sea levels, we now have the sight of hurricane Ivan maintaining its deadly path across the Caribbean, the third to have battered the region this summer. </p> <p>Of course, climatologists are - rightly - cautious about linking this profusion of storms with manmade activities. Other explanations, involving decades-long cycles in ocean current behaviour, can still account for their appearance and for the billions of dollars of damage hurricanes have inflicted. </p> <p>But it would be a distinctly unimaginative individual who could look at Ivan's handiwork and fail to note humanity's frailty when faced with the fury of the elements. For all our sophisticated meteorology and communications, satellites and radar, our ability to organise emergency airlifts and evacuations, we remain vulnerable when battling against Nature at its angriest. </p> <p>As the distinguished Harvard scientist EO Wilson has noted: 'More frequent heat waves, violent storms, forest fires, droughts, and flooding will be the spawn of our historically unprecedented pace of climate change.' Gainsayers may deny mankind's role in global warming, but scientists who have been monitoring the atmosphere for the past 15 years are convinced our indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels, in cars and factories, has raised atmospheric temperatures by one degree Celsius over the past century. A further four or five over the next 50 years is also forecast, and is expected to unleash weather of undreamt-of ferocity. </p> <p>Can we rectify our behaviour, cut our industrial emissions and make greater reliance on renewable sources of energy in order to save our world? Mr Blair will no doubt claim we can. More cynical commentators may disagree, for the power to halt climate change lies outside our direct control. Until America - responsible for almost a quarter of the planet's total carbon dioxide emissions - commits itself to the cause, hopes of stopping our world overheating will be doomed to failure. </p> <p>The Prime Minister has been pressed several times by his cabinet colleagues to underline his climatological differences with the White House and to show that he is capable of standing up to the Republican right on issues of principle. Until he does, there is no prospect of America understanding its isolation on this issue, and therefore no prospect of our planet saving itself.</p>",
  "Tony Blair will press ahead with scaling down the army presence in Northern Ireland even if there is no deal between the Ulster parties at this week's talks in Kent aimed at restoring devolution in the Province. <p>Under consideration by the Prime Minister and his staff is the dismantling of more army spy posts in south Armagh as well as further troop cuts, The Observer has learned. </p> <p>In return, Blair is seeking a statement from the IRA confirming that all so-called punishment beatings and shootings have been halted. Downing Street negotiators, including the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff Jonathan Powell, believe such a communique would be seen as physical evidence that the IRA's violence is over. </p> <p>But the Unionists, who are central to the success or failure of the talks at Leeds Castle, Kent, warned last night that any further moves to placate Sinn Fein would be resisted. </p> <p>Sources close to the Government said some aspects of the Joint Declaration from the British and Irish Prime Ministers last autumn would be implemented. This would centre on demilitarisation particularly in republican strongholds like south Armagh. However, it would not include amnesties for convicted IRA terrorists wanted for crimes in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>'Blair is keen to give something to the Provos if they give him something in return,' one source close to the planning for this week's Leeds Castle negotiations said yesterday. </p> <p>'There will be a big emphasis on south Armagh and the hilltop fortresses and dismantle a few of them. The security assessment is that the Real IRA is a broken organisation in the border region with only a small base up in Derry. The intelligence reports show that the Real IRA and the other dis sidents are in disarray so the time might be right for a relaxation of security on the border.' </p> <p>The Observer has learned that the next wave of troop cuts will run to several hundred from a current force of 12,000; although military sources stress they are nowhere near reaching the peacetime garrison figure of 5,000. </p> <p>Five spy posts have been pulled down since October 2000. The army still maintains eight observation towers perched on six hilltop locations in south Armagh. Sinn Fein has demanded that all the remaining towers be dismantled. </p> <p>Meanwhile Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said yesterday his party was up for a deal at Leeds Castle. </p> <p>The West Belfast MP also confirmed that Sinn Fein was prepared to vote Dr Ian Paisley as Northern Ireland's First Minister if his Democratic Unionist Party agrees to share power with republicans. </p> <p>Last week, Blair hinted he was drawing up a 'Plan B' for Northern Ireland if talks failed to restore a powersharing administration, adding that if a deal was not done 'we have got to look for another way forward'. </p> <p>Democratic Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson said the Prime Minister's willingness to significantly reduce the military presence would be a unilateral concession to Sinn Fein. </p> <p>'What we need is a real peace process, not a piecemeal process,' he said.</p>",
  "The ramrod-straight back and perfectly executed salute were to be expected from a man who had lied to join the US army at the age of 15. <p>When Charles Jenkins reported for duty at the US army's headquarters in Japan yesterday, however, it was not as an ordinary soldier, but as one accused of turning his back on his country almost four decades ago to live in North Korea. </p> <p>His surrender marked the start of a legal process that will be keenly watched in Japan and will, perhaps, bring to a satisfactory end a case that has harmed Japan-US relations. </p> <p>Jenkins, 64, is accused of deserting his unit while on patrol in South Korea in 1965 and fleeing across the border to the communist north, where he taught English and occasionally played sinister Americans in North Korean propaganda films. </p> <p>Among his English students was Hitomi Soga, a nurse from Japan who had been abducted from her home in 1978 and taken to North Korea to teach Japanese to Pyongyang agents. They married in 1980 and had two daughters. </p> <p>Soga, 45, and four other abducted Japanese citizens were permitted to return home two years ago, but Jenkins stayed behind with their daughters because he feared arrest by US military authorities in Japan. The four were reunited in Jakarta last July and flew to Japan so that Jenkins could receive medical treatment. </p> <p>Most Japanese are desperate for a happy ending for Soga, who has won widespread praise for the dignified way she has handled her family's plight. The Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has much to gain if Jenkins avoids prison. He was instrumental in persuading him to come to Japan and has made repeated pleas to the US government to show leniency, for Soga's sake. </p> <p>US army spokesman Major John Amberg gave assurances yesterday that Jenkins would 'be treated with dignity and fairness', adding that he was 'innocent until proven guilty'. </p> <p>'Sir, I'm Sergeant Jenkins and I'm reporting,' he told Lieutenant Colonel Paul Nigara, when he arrived at Camp Zama, just outside Tokyo. Nigara replied: 'You are now under the control of the US army.' </p> <p>Jenkins was expected to be given a uniform, ID card and haircut. He will be entitled to the benefits afforded any other sergeant and will perform administrative duties. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the charges against him are serious. Aside from desertion, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, he is accused of aiding the enemy, encouraging disloyalty and urging other US servicemen to defect. </p> <p>Jenkins has spent the past few weeks preparing his defence with an army-appointed lawyer. The most likely option is a plea bargain in which he would plead guilty to one of the four charges and tell the US all he knows about North Korea in return for a dishonourable discharge. </p> <p>Soga remained characteristically optimistic. 'I expect we'll have a lot more to face in the days to come,' she said. 'But we hope the four of us can live together as soon as possible.'</p>",
  "A former public schoolgirl dubbed Britain's most wanted woman is back living in Britain, The Observer can reveal, despite a five-year police search for her across five European countries. <p>Conservative politician's daughter Fiona Mont, 34, is wanted by police over her alleged involvement in a \u00a3300,000 computer fraud in 1999 - a charge she denies. But Mont, whom friends dubbed 'the cat' because of her ability to avoid capture, is living in a caravan park with her boyfriend and two children just a few miles from her mother's home in Hove, East Sussex. </p> <p>Mont, a one-time law student from a prominent Sussex family - her late father was a criminal lawyer and county under-sherriff and her mother Joan chaired the Conservative county council - was arrested by East Sussex police late in 1999. </p> <p>After being bailed Mont went on the run, first faking her own death in January 2000, leaving her car with the keys in the ignition at notorious suicide spot Beachy Head, and then fleeing the country the following day in a light aircraft piloted by her boyfriend Graham Hesketh, 42, a convicted drug smuggler. Hesketh this week told The Observer how the couple had seen their flight from the authorities together as a romantic Bonnie and Clyde style adventure. </p> <p>'First we went to Holland, then Belgium, the French Riviera for a bit, oh, and Germany. Then Spain, Gibraltar and Portugal,' said Hesketh. 'We had a caravan so small we called it \"the egg\" and my old Land Rover, but we were very much in love and we had a great time.' </p> <p>Hesketh picked up jobs as a labourer and the couple had their first child, Samantha, in 2001 but they were tracked down by British police officers and Interpol in December that year and Mont was arrested at a caravan site near Malaga in Spain. She spent a month in a Spanish jail while extradition procedures were processed. 'She was very low at that point,' said Hesketh. 'She thought that was it, she was going to be sent back and go to jail.' </p> <p>But, to the fury of British police, a Spanish magistrate allowed her out on bail and she was on the run again. Back home in the UK her friends set up a website which mocked police for their inability to catch the fugitives. Meanwhile the officer in charge of the case, Detective Constable Steve Skerrett, was reduced to seeking new leads from the public by making television appeals for information on Crimewatch and Britain's Most Wanted . </p> <p>Sussex officers have spent thousands of pounds pursuing her - the two-day police helicopter and coastguard boat hunt at Beachy Head alone cost Sussex taxpayers an estimated \u00a330,000 before Mont's mother admitted she had had a call from her runaway daughter, revealing she had left the country. </p> <p>But now, Hesketh claims, Mont has been living openly back in Sussex for over a year. Their 11-month-old son, Benjamin, was born at Worthing hospital and the family still use the distinctive white Land Rover that Skerrett had asked British holidaymakers to look out for in TV appeals. </p> <p>Hesketh said: 'She's not using any disguises or false names like she has before, just going about her business as normal. We have two children, we just want to get on with life, get married, maybe go back and live in Spain. </p> <p>'The police would be gutted if they knew how long we'd been here. I'm working, doing odd jobs, but it's all legit, I'm paying tax and everything.' </p> <p>He went on: 'It's no fun being on the run and having to uproot yourself every few weeks, especially with children. It was romantic at first but it was hard too. </p> <p>'We just want to lead a straight life now and if she has to face any charges, she's ready for it.' </p> <p>Hesketh revealed that Mont first flew back into Britain on a Monarch Airlines flight from Faro in Portugal to Gatwick on 21 November 2002 'to test the water', but was fully expecting to be arrested when she presented her passport to immigration officials. To her shock, she wasn't. </p> <p>'It was then we realised they didn't really care. Fiona even has the occasional text message from Skerrett and rang the East Sussex Chief Constable's office to ask if she should come in to be questioned. But they never returned her call. So we all started making regular trips and then we moved back permanently.' </p> <p>Hesketh went on: 'We want to clear the air for the sake of the children. We're sick of all this fraud stuff. She says she had nothing to do with it at all. We want to put it behind us and get on with the rest of our lives.' </p> <p>Skerrett has since left the police force and with him, apparently, went much of the interest in closing the open file on the original fraud. </p> <p>A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'The warrant for Fiona Mont's arrest would seem to have expired. The file on this case remains open. We would be very interested in information about Fiona Mont's current whereabouts if she was here on a long-term basis.'</p>",
  "<p>There wasn't enough booing in Edinburgh last month. The city is supposed to test young talent, promote the avant-garde and fill the cultural veins of the world with fresh blood. Why is it just the critics who get to choose what lives and what dies? </p> <p>The comedians understand this, especially on the late-night open mike shows where the crowd are red-mist drunk and coliseum vicious. I recall one poor boy actually start apologising: 'I was up early and haven't had the chance to get on top of my material.' That was a mistake and he was quickly led from the stage in tears. </p> <p>We shouldn't feel bad, though. A thin skin is a great enemy of art, and I am sure that man is now a happy estate agent in Croydon, if not someone you'd want to sit next to at dinner. </p> <p>With the high arts, we are too polite. This is one of several distinct, and narrow, areas where we would benefit from being more Mediterranean. What is the point of people spending their time getting projects on to the page and then on to the stage if we are not to match their passion with our own? </p> <p>Certainly, we Celts aren't afraid of booing. Look at sporting events. It doesn't require a trip to Ibrox to hear some stout denunciations from the terraces. However, it's worth being careful, because I'm talking about performance, not the ugly tribalism that has some thug shouting that he 'wants to bathe' in another man's 'Fenian blood'. </p> <p>The booing I'm talking of is of the sort aimed at stout Chris Robinson, the CEO of Hearts. There can be no better expression of the fans' fury over the sale of their home ground, Tynecastle, than the chant: 'Who ate all the pies?' </p> <p>This can grow in importance, as when the New York Islanders ice hockey team journeyed to Montreal's Bell Centre to play the Montreal Canadiens last year. The New York fans were outraged when nearly 21,000 Canadiens' supporters booed the 'Star Spangled Banner'. This protest at the invasion of Iraq quickly led to tit-for-tat abuse of the respective national anthems at subsequent games. There were similar displays at the recent Olympics. </p> <p>Obviously for the sportsmen, this is deeply unfair, but then so is George Bush's use of the Iraqi football team's success as a prop in his re-election campaign. The squandering of global sympathy is important to November's US elections, and it can only be good that American voters hear cries from outside their borders. My guess is that more swing voters watch ice hockey games than read the editorial pages of the New York Times but, having said that, the Montreal fans' behaviour may have the opposite effect to what was intended. </p> <p>It's a bit of a leap from Bush's behaviour to my irritation at the Hanover State Opera's decision to set Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande in some white palace of an asylum. But then, you have to react to what is in front of you, and I am grumpy that the superb singers and orchestra were so ill-served. Booing is the captive audience's response to being ill-served - by those leading us or entertaining us. </p> <p>Perhaps that is why the Mediterraneans are more keen on expressing disgust - they are more used to being politically powerless. Or perhaps not. Booing started with paid claques taking out the opposition, and instilled itself in the culture. The great fear of those in the arts in Britain is that booing will only be used for reactionary purposes, that audiences will shout down anything that is new and interesting. </p> <p>Yet Edinburgh audiences are up for a bit of modernity. The problem with the Debussy was not the pure white walls that the originally wooded set had become, but the complete separation of the words from the action. There was no vision to offer us anything new. In Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, even the guns used in his Verona (beach) have Sword.45 written down their sides, neatly shifting Shakespeare's text into context. Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, M\u00e9lisande throws her ring into the sea, the performer staring at the hospital floor. We should have howled. </p> <p>Anyone engaged in a creative act will tell you what they most fear is a shrug of the shoulders. They will tell you passion, either in favour or against, is preferable. I don't know if I completely believe that. After all, I am asking for trouble here. I have never heard any booing at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, but I have been asked by an old lady why I was 'so boring'. My hurt was compounded when a friend cheered her on. </p> <p>This is what it's all about, though, if you set yourself up to entertain (and doubly so if you plan to lead). The moment I most enjoyed at the Book Festival occurred a few years ago, when I watched Will Self field a question about whether he had modelled for the cover picture of his novel, Great Apes. So, let's bring on the passion. Boo when booing's due and roar when roaring's called for. </p> <p>I'm going to treasure this Mediterranean dream, just as I sometimes pray for the day when Italian-style driving takes hold in the UK. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com\">ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ruaridh Nicoll's novel, Wide Eyed, is published in paperback by Black Swan, \u00a36.99</p>",
  "Conservative reshuffles come and go, we shadow ministers move up, down or - as in my case last week - out, but the real problem for the Conservative party has been obstinately the same since 1997: how can we persuade more than 30 per cent of the electorate to vote for us? If we can't, we are doomed to permanent opposition under a first-past-the-post system, however enthusiastic that 30 per cent may be about us. Even at a time when Tony Blair and his government have been rightly falling in public esteem, those searching for a new political home have been spreading themselves everywhere else except the Conservative party. <p>The inexorable logic that 30 per cent means continuing lost elections leads me to disbelieve the widespread press comment that the leadership is engaged in a deliberate shift to the right, and a strategy of shoring up the core Conservative vote by planning to campaign more on Europe and asylum, the issues that set the pulses racing among Conservative activists but fail to do so among the wider population. Michael Howard is far too shrewd not to remember that we have tried this before, in the run-up to the 2001 election, and that proved a disaster that set the party's recovery back by many years. </p> <p>I am equally puzzled by reports that the Conservative party is so scared about the United Kingdom Independence party (Ukip) that it feels the need to appease its voters. Puzzled because there are two clear reasons why this would not work. First, if you start edging towards Ukip you may well pick up some extra support on one side, but you will shed support on the other - and the last time I looked the Liberal Democrats were rather better supported than Ukip. Secondly, there are indeed a small number of people who hold the honest view that this country should leave the EU. I believe they are wrong, and so does the Conservative party, and their view is so straightforward that there is no compromising with it, no fudging that would satisfy all sides. So appeasement of Ukip would do more harm than good. </p> <p>A successful strategy will start from the premise that voters know what is important in their lives, and that we need to show them Conservative solutions to the problems that face them. One of the peculiarities of the 2001 debacle was that evidence was laid before MPs and party professionals that the economy, crime, health and education were what people cared about, and that Europe and asylum featured last. Nevertheless, we chose the least important issues as the centre of our campaign. </p> <p>The best thing we have done in the past three years is to accept that public services are an absolutely key issue, and to devote time and effort to devising practical policies that will deal with current difficulties, while also fitting into a recognisably Tory view of the world. We need now to have the confidence to keep them high on our agenda. Tony Blair in opposition recognised that as long as the economy remained a 'Tory issue', which Labour could at best play down, Labour was going to lose. So he turned it into a genuine battleground. We need to do the same on the big so-called 'Labour issues'. </p> <p>Let's also learn from George Bush. Education was an issue the Republicans thought they could never capture. He made it the centrepiece of his compassionate conservatism, and look what happened. In 2000 he won when he was, in British terms, fighting an incumbent administration confident of a third term. That sounds rather a good scenario to me. We also need to remember how little time people devote to politics and to make the policies memorable. Take two of the issues I have helped develop. Abolishing university tuition fees and getting rid of unnecessary speed cameras are ideas that can be grasped instantly, and grab the attention of those for whom politics is a complete switch-off. We need to do more of this. </p> <p>Of course, we do not need to spend all our firepower on the public services. Crime, policing and the maintenance of orderly streets have always been heartland Tory concerns and hugely important to millions of people. The central nature of this issue illustrates why we need relentlessly to demonstrate that we are a moderate, pragmatic party and not a set of ideologues. The tough policies we need (and have) on crime and related issues will no doubt be dubbed 'extremist' by Labour. It is much easier to brush this away if it is apparent from everything we say and the way we say it that we are not remotely extreme. </p> <p>It is also a key part of the moderate Conservatism I have always believed in that tackling crime and disorder is one of the best ways to help the less fortunate. Those who can live in protected communities and travel in cars are less likely to meet everyday disorder and dirt than those living in flats on estates and using public transport. So there is no dichotomy between modern practical conservatism and traditional Conservative 'tough' messages on some issues. </p> <p>For years the 'modernisers' have been arguing that the Conservative party needs to look and sound different. This is correct, but it is not enough. The real challenge is to produce easily understood policies in the key areas which fit into a framework that itself applies Tory principles to 21st-century Britain. When we do that, and sell the policies relentlessly, we will break through the ceiling that we keep hitting in the polls, and will look forward to doing the real job of the Conservative party: running this country in the interests of all its people.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Damian Green is MP for Ashford, Kent</p>"
