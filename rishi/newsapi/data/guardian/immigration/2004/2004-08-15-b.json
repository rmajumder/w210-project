  "<p>Being as kind to himself as he had been to his guest, at the end of <strong> The Interview</strong> (World Service, Sunday), Denis Murray declared that the preceding half-hour of talking to Max Clifford had been \"absolutely fascinating\". It hadn't. Clifford is a lively enough interview subject, but being interviewed by Murray is like flopping down into the squishiest, softest sofa. </p> <p>There was no challenge to Clifford's dubious distinction between the hypocrisy he loathes and reveals - when someone, such as a politician, pretends to be something they are not - and his fabrication of stories about celebrities to enhance orprotect their public profile (\"It's light relief, it's escape, it's entertainment,\" he said, by way of a defence). I waited for Murray to point out that, despite context, both are lies, but he never did. </p> <p>Murray's interview technique seemed to consist of empathising and nodding along, bolstering his subject's self-analysis with agreement and warm nudges. \"I'm sure you must treasure her all the more because of that experience,\" he said when Clifford spoke of his daughter's long illness. I'm sure he does too, but that's hardly the most interrogatory approach. This doesn't often happen, but midway through the encounter, I found myself wanting John Humphrys. </p> <p>A more emphatic clash was the subject of <strong> Between the Ears: I Made Pizza for Kim Jong Il</strong> (Radio 3, Saturday). Juxtaposing the story of Italian chef Ermanno Furlanis, invited to North Korea to teach pizza-making skills and cook for the regime's Leader, with desperate stories of poverty and starvation from North Korean refugees, this quirky, impressionistic programme made for queasy listening. </p> <p>For one lavish state dinner, Furlanis sees trays of the finest cheese and cases of prized French wine being delivered, and jokes that they should have some Italian products. \"Three days later,\" he notes, \"fresh from Italy, there came a shipment of Barolo.\" Meanwhile, ordinary citizens, in the grip of a famine (\"the marsh of hunger\" as one calls it) are digging up arrowroot with their hands, and one refugee remembers seeing hundreds of people raiding a train full of corn. The next night he sees groups of them roasting their corn kernels on makeshift fires. \"They looked like crows,\" he says bitterly. </p> <p>Delicious dishes and dotty deference peppered <strong> Cooking Up a Royal Treat</strong> (Radio 4, Saturday). Flo Wadlow, now 92, reminisced about cooking for the great and the good, and even Queen Mary, in the 1930s. As part of her regular 15-hour day, spinach had to be pushed through a sieve before serving, she explained. \"You couldn't have bits of stalk and nothing like that,\" said Flo, reeling at the very idea. \"Not for gentry. Good gracious, no.\"</p>",
  "A Jamaican woman who fled to Britain after gangsters murdered her son and shot her in the head has been told she must return to Kingston despite her fears that the gunmen will kill her. <p>An immigration appeals tribunal has backed the Home Office's rejection of her asylum application on the grounds that her experiences did not constitute persecution in terms of factors such as race, religion or political opinion. </p> <p>But supporters say the government may be sending her back to her death by refusing to use its discretion to grant her the right to remain on compassionate grounds. </p> <p>Doctors were astonished that Joan Shurland survived the attack, which left her in a coma for three months. She requires facial surgery, has lost one eye, is partially disabled and has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. </p> <p>Relatives urged her to flee Jamaica because of further threats. </p> <p>In January her house in Kingston was burned down. </p> <p>\"If I go back I will be dead,\" Ms Shurland, 45, said yesterday from her home in the west Midlands. </p> <p>\"My son is afraid to go and look for work in town or even take the bus. This kind of life is like a prison.\" </p> <p>Her ordeal began in late 1999 when her daughter Rickkesha Duhane, now 24, fled home after being warned that a gang of men planned to rape her. </p> <p>They told others that Rickkesha was being \"disrespectful\" by seeing a man from another neighbourhood. </p> <p>Ms Shurland believes that the family was also targeted because they supported a different political party from the gunmen. </p> <p>Despite Rickkesha's escape, five men stormed the family home, shooting Ms Shurland in the head after murdering her son Rasheed Lopez, 18, in front of her. </p> <p>\"The first one threw up the mattress off the bed to see if she was hiding under the bed. When he saw she wasn't there he just turned and shot my son in the face. Just like that,\" Ms Shurland said. </p> <p>\"Can you imagine, you stand there and see your child dying? He fell on the table and the glass shattered. He died with his eyes and mouth wide open. His girlfriend had just had his first child. </p> <p>\"The police didn't take no action and there was nothing I could do. Because we were poor and couldn't afford a lawyer they were still free walking up and down and my life was still in jeopardy.\" </p> <p>Rickkesha had fled to the United States, but the same men subsequently slashed her former boyfriend in the face so badly that he required 42 stitches. </p> <p>Several months after that, Ms Shurland was walking to church when two of the attackers spotted her, pulled out knives and chased her. </p> <p>She escaped into a police station. She flew to Britain in 2002 after hearing that the men were looking for her again. </p> <p>Tauhid Pasha, legal director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \"This is a startling case and a prime example of how the government are entirely devoid of compassion in how they exercise their discretion.\" </p> <p>Lester Holloway, the editor of the website Black Information Link, which is supporting Joan's case, said: \"It seems amazing that someone shot through the head, with her son killed before her eyes, should have their claim for asylum rejected. </p> <p>\"She is convinced she will die if sent back to Jamaica. There is every reason to fear this will be the case.\" </p> <p>The Home Office does not comment on individual cases. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"All asylum claims are considered on their individual merits in accordance with the UK's obligations under the 1951 UN convention relating to the status of refugees. </p> <p>\"If asylum is refused we will consider whether humanitarian protection or discretionary leave should be granted in accordance with obligations under the UN convention on human rights. </p> <p>\"If the individual is unsuccessful in an appeal to the independent immigration appellate authority and has no valid legal claim to remain in the UK, we would seek to remove them.\"</p>",

  "There is a general perception that effective policing ideas are either American or European. Western journalism focuses on the troubles in the Middle East and has helped to build a caricature of Muslim countries as hotbeds of despotism whose law enforcement agencies are renowned for human rights breaches and corruption rather than for good policing innovations. The British public can be forgiven for believing that, once one enters the Middle East, sensitive, innovative and efficient policing is replaced by that of corrupt, camel-hoarding officials and feudal warlords who chop off the hands of thieves and stone adulterers to death. <p>The implication is that Islam and harmony don't mix; that freedom and choice cannot be found in a Muslim country. </p> <p>Sensitive policing won't work in Afghanistan because of the warlords; it won't work in Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), or the rest of the Arab world because of autocrats and Muslim extremists. </p> <p>And thus the critics conveniently dismiss the millions of Muslims who remain true to their religion but thrive under peace and revere it. </p> <p>I set out to examine policing in the UAE. The way a nation polices its people is indicative of its national values, and a true gauge of its commitment to its citizens' wellbeing. </p> <p>Dubai is one of the most ethnically diverse societies in the world and, by examining the governance, structure, accountability and legitimacy of its police force, it was patently obvious that British policing can learn an enormous amount about how law enforcement can help achieve community harmony. </p> <p>Here is a state in the most volatile part of Middle East where commercialism and capitalist philosophies walk hand in hand with Islamic values. </p> <p>Strong religious values seem to merge easily with the growing western influence imported by British and US companies and expatriates. </p> <p>Its population is much more diverse than in most British cities, with over 180 nationalities speaking more than 100 languages - yet there is a conspicuous absence of inter-community tension. It is one of the busiest tourist destinations in the Middle East, with 45,000 British expatriates. </p> <p>Unlike in Britain, the host community is in a minority and the majority of the population are there to work - invited for their skills. Hence immigration and asylum is celebrated rather than demonised. </p> <p>Dubai has transformed its standing as a centre of commerce by utilising the skills of migrant workers and professionals, who are subject to stringent but realistic conditions. T</p> <p>heir welcome does not include placing them in holding centres and giving them food vouchers; there is no daily tabloid press portraying them as parasites. </p> <p>There are, however, a number of conditions. For example, they cannot buy property unless it is in designated zones. These zones are not ghettos - the aim is to ensure that the country's Islamic values are not undermined by western mores. </p> <p>In a recent public opinion survey, 84% of Dubai residents said they felt \"secure and safe\", despite being a stone's throw from some of the most problematic countries in the world. The crime detection rate of 89% puts to shame our own struggle to detect crime. </p> <p>Every police district employs a team of officers whose job is to ensure compliance to human rights. Senior police officers and politicians welcome these rights rather than see them as a hindrance. </p> <p>And, rather than adopt Britain's conventional method of putting police officers in classes and telling them what a Muslim or a Hindu looks like, operational officers are sent on intensive courses to learn the languages of the migrant communities, encouraging a true understanding of different cultures. They are expected to conduct interviews in these languages. </p> <p>The greatest threat to the UAE, and to Dubai in particular, is from the organised criminals who are inevitably attracted by the country's wealth. </p> <p>There is growing evidence of the presence of south-east Asian gangs, west African drugs cartels and major-league British criminals using Dubai as a base for their activities. </p> <p>The extent of money laundering through the country's banks, and drug trafficking via its ports, are serious concerns for its government and for Britain. </p> <p>If Dubai is not to become a haven for organised criminals, the police forces of Britain and Dubai must collaborate. But while British officers can assist Dubai's police, there is a lot that British policing can learn from the Muslim world and its attitude to community relations. </p> <p>The idea that we know best in the west how to police our communities may soon have to be given a decent but final burial. </p> <p>\u00b7 Dr Ali Dizaei is a chief superintendent in the Metropolitan police and legal adviser to the National Black Police Association </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "As a young man, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez discovered that his great-grandfather was a renowned guerrilla fighter, though he had been brought up to believe he was a criminal. Ch\u00e1vez set off to explore the area around the Colombian border where he had fought, with the idea of writing his ancestor's history. With his camera, tape recorder and research materials, the Colombian military took him for a spy and arrested him. After arguing for hours beneath a portrait of Simon Bolivar, the continent's 19th century liberator who tried to unite South America, Chavez pointed to the picture of the freedom fighter and appealed to his captor. Less than a century ago, he said, we would have been brothers in arms in Bolivar's army. <p>Chavez's hopes of carrying forward Bolivar's legacy rest with the people of Venezuela, voting this weekend on the future of his left-wing presidency. Like the inhabitants of the fictional Macondo in Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude , the players in Venezuela's febrile politics seem fated to continually revisit the continent's troubled past. </p> <p>And both sides, Ch\u00e1vez's left-wing presidency and an opposition representing the business interests of Venezuela's ancien r\u00e9gime, appropriate the continent's historic giants to their cause, praising or condemning, inter alia, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, and Chile's Augusto Pinochet and Salvador Allende. But for Chavez, no figure looms larger than the man who tried to unite South America. </p> <p>Whether his cherished history will reassert itself in Venezuela as tragedy or farce - or as a moment of national redemption - will be decided at the ballot boxes today in a referendum on his possible 'recall' - the culmination of the opposition's attempts to depose the 50-year-old. </p> <p>The troubled six-year rule of Ch\u00e1vez ('El Commandante') has been marked by strikes, lethal demonstrations and an attempted coup. It is more than a parochial issue. Venezuela is the biggest exporter of oil to the US - ahead even of Saudi Arabia - so its political stability has profound implications in a time of soaring oil prices. </p> <p>And critical in deciding the result will be whether Venezuela sees its president as a champion of social justice against the country's elites, and an international champion of anti-globalization, or as a dictator in the making who wants to remodel the country as a second Cuba. </p> <p>The opposition, including most of the country's media, whose proprietors were parties to the attempted coup, line up behind the latter position. Their view is shared by the US, whose officials were implicated in the failed coup, and by those Venezuelans who have most to lose from Ch\u00e1vez's ambitious plans for social reform. </p> <p>By contrast, international support for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez comes from those who in a previous era spoke for the Sandanistas and against Chile's Pinochet, among them British writers and film-makers Harold Pinter, Eric Hobsbawm, Ken Loach and Mike Hodges, as well as new campaigners for social justice, including the Canadian writer Naomi Klein. </p> <p>The way in which the battle-lines have been drawn have as much to do with Ch\u00e1vez's position as a figurehead of opposition to US policy in the region (he called George W Bush an 'asshole') as with his domestic policies. In recent days, Ch\u00e1vez has insisted that today's referendum, far from being simply a Venezuelan issue, is a battle against US imperialism. </p> <p>Which leaves the question: who is the real Ch\u00e1vez? Even the sympathetic Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez struggled to answer this when he interviewed Ch\u00e1vez shortly after his election in 1998. He concluded that he had the potential to fulfil both the role ascribed to him by friends and that attributed to him by his enemies. </p> <p>In his article, The Enigma of the Two Ch\u00e1vezes , Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez remarked that he felt he had been speaking to two different men: 'One a self-styled visionary who had been granted the opportunity to save his country. The other... an illusionist, who might pass into history as just another despot.' </p> <p>Charismatic Ch\u00e1vez has deliberately identified himself with two of South America's most powerful historical icons: Bolivar, for whom he named his social revolution, and Fidel Castro, his autocratic mentor for whom he has declared admiration and to whom he is supplying Venezuelan oil. And his use of Venezuela's oil - and the revenues from it - are, in large measure, the reason Mr Ch\u00e1vez is such a bogeyman for the US and Venezuelan opposition. His threat to cut oil supplies if the US continued 'meddling' in Latin America did not go down well in Washington. </p> <p>Sitting on the world's fifth largest reserves of oil, Venezuela supplies 13 per cent of US needs. Ch\u00e1vez rose to power on the back of his allegations that the country's wealth was being squandered by the country's corrupt elites. </p> <p>His rhetoric, combined with his dark mestizo looks, provincial accent, modest background and populist persona (including a passion for baseball), galvanised his country's massive underclass against the existing political order, and delivered him the biggest majority in the history of Venezuela's democracy. </p> <p>When Ch\u00e1vez quickly made good on his threats against the management of the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela it triggered the country's rolling political crisis that at one stage saw all oil exports halted. </p> <p>A prolonged oil strike in 2002 after he tried to move against Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela's management was followed by a lock-out that in turn opened the way for Ch\u00e1vez to achieve some of his political ends. He fired thousands of the sector's most privileged employees and redirected millions in revenues to his pet projects, including funding Venezuela's welcome to 13,000 Cuban doctors. </p> <p>The battle provoked demonstrations and violence in Caracas leading in April 2002 to 17 deaths and hundreds injured when pro-government and opposition gunmen each fired on unarmed demonstrators. A short-lived 'media-military coup d'\u00e9tat' on 12 April put Chavez out of office for two days. Venezuela's poor took the streets and secured his return. </p> <p>By 2003, strikes, demonstrations and a coup having failed to remove him, the opposition - with US encouragement - began organising a 'recall' petition for a referendum on his presidency, a mechanism ironically only possible as a result of Ch\u00e1vez's constitutional reforms. </p> <p>The opposition's retreat from street confrontation has been matched by a kind of truce with the US which, with the high oil price, a weakening economy and an election in the autumn, has also pulled back from further conflict with Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (an invited international observer for today's referendum) found Chavez a paradox. Born in 1954 and brought up by impoverished teacher parents, the young Ch\u00e1vez was, by the age of nine, supplementing the family income by selling fruit and sweets on the streets. A talented musician, artist and sportsman as a youth, a career in the military was not his first choice, but he settled on it when a friend told him it could be a route to professional baseball. </p> <p>By the early 1990s, Ch\u00e1vez, by then a colonel, was one of the founders of the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, which launched a failed military coup against President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez over unpopular austerity measures. He spent two years in jail but, pardoned and released, relaunched his group as the democratic Movement for the Fifth Republic. </p> <p>On the 'visionary' side of the balance sheet, Ch\u00e1vez himself lists his achievements since his election largely in terms of social justice. He claims to have reduced infant mortality by 30 per cent, improved child vaccination and access to health services and hired thousands of new teachers on higher salaries while giving land to more than a million landless or largely landless agrarian poor. </p> <p>The counterpoint to Ch\u00e1vez's campaign for social justice for the poor, has been an attack on the ingrained privileges of Venezuela's old elites. </p> <p>The opposition, and their sometime US backers, believe that this demonstrates his 'Jacobin tendencies'. Faced with institutions stacked with opponents - including the judiciary, military and congress - Ch\u00e1vez first came into conflict with Venezuela's business community in 1999 when he passed a series of new laws to apply his left-leaning economic policy. </p> <p>He also organised referendums to re-write the country's constitution, under a new Constitutional Assembly opponents say is packed with his supporters and has been allowed to hijack functions of the legislature. Ch\u00e1vez, too, has done little to reassure the 20 per cent or so of undecided voters, remarking that while his 'revolution is peaceful', it is also armed. </p> <p>This, perhaps, is the greatest unresolved mystery about Ch\u00e1vez. For, while the opposition accuses Ch\u00e1vistas of harassment, it is also true that for all their claims of Ch\u00e1vez's brutality, death squads do not roam Venezuela's countryside, nor are its jails full of political prisoners. </p> <p>Evidence of creeping authoritarianism is more subtle. From the Supreme Court to elements of the security forces that supported his enemies in the events leading up to the abortive coup, Ch\u00e1vez has moved to bring more of the state under his direct control. </p> <p>For now, though, Ch\u00e1vez and Venezuela will have to wait for the outcome of a referendum whose result remains too difficult to call. And to see whether Ch\u00e1vez can survive to bring about the promise of his democratic transformation of Venezuelan society - or whether, ironically, like Bolivar himself, his will be a flawed destiny that ends with dictatorship and eventual defeat. </p> <p><b> Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</b> </p> <p> <b> DoB:</b> 28 July, 1954 (Sabaneta, Barinas) </p> <p><b> Family: </b> Son of schoolteachers, he is married and has five children (three sons and two daughters) </p> <p><b> Education:</b> A degree in engineering from Venezuela's Military Academy </p> <p><b> Likes:</b> Baseball, Fidel Castro</p>",
  "<p>Paul McCartney found himself in Lagos in August 1972. The plan had been to record a new record - the record that became Band on the Run - at somewhere other than Abbey Road and EMI had offered one of its studios in Rio de Janeiro or Peking. Instead, the former Beatle insisted on the Nigerian capital, picturing himself 'lying on the beach all day doing nothing and recording at night'. </p> <p>As he drily noted later, 'it didn't turn out quite like that', what with being held up at knife point, the lepers in the streets, the omnipresent military, the corruption and the lack of security. Still, Lagos had its attractions. Chief among these was the chance to check out Fela Ransome-Kuti's band - 'the best band I've ever seen live ... When Fela and his band eventually began to play, after a long, crazy build-up, I just couldn't stop weeping with joy. It was a very moving experience.' </p> <p>Thrilled by his experience, McCartney thought of recording with some of the musicians working with the extraordinary 33-year-old firebrand. When Fela caught wind of the plan he denounced McCartney from the stage of his club and then arrived unannounced at the studio to berate him for 'stealing black man's music'. </p> <p>As McCartney said at the time: 'We were gonna use African musicians, but when we were told we were about to pinch the music we thought, \"Well, up to you, we'll do it ourselves.\" Fela thought we were stealing black African music, the Lagos sound. So I had to say, \"Do us a favour, Fela, we do OK. We're all right as it is. We sell a couple of records here and there.\" </p> <p>'I thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to Lagos and people would say, \"Oh, by the way, what's the music down there like?\" and I'd say it was unbelievable. It is unbelievable ... it's incredible music down there. I think it will come to the fore.'</p> <p>The incident caused a brief storm in Lagos, and illustrates Fela's fearlessness, his love of controversy and an unerring ability to piss on his own parade. When Motown wanted to set up an African label in the early 1980s, it offered Fela a million-dollar deal. This despite his insistence at the time of recording radio-hostile 60-minute songs, and never playing old material, so that live audiences would never hear his hits. </p> <p>Rikki Stein, one of his then managers, was hugely excited and flew to Lagos to discuss the deal. Stein says that Fela's response was to contact the spirits via his personal magician, Professor Hindu. The spirits refused to let him sign for another two years and Fela further insisted on only leasing his back catalogue. 'Even then, Motown went along with it. But after two years, in April 1985, the very month that Fela was about to sign, the Motown guy got sacked and the deal was off,' says Stein. 'Maybe the spirits knew something.' </p> <p>Certainly, Fela Kuti was the ultimate rebel, a spiritualist, pan-African revolutionary and a prodigious dope smoker and polygamist. Harassed, beaten and tortured by the authorities, he was a dancer, a saxophonist and a composer. He called himself 'Abami Edo', the strange one, the weird one. He dropped the Ransome part of his name - asking 'Do I look like an Englishman?' - and changed his surname to Anikulapo ('one who carries death in the pouch'). He also billed himself as the Black President, the Chief of the Shrine. Seven years after his death, the mysteries surrounding him continue to unravel, and a season of events at the Barbican in London this autumn will celebrate his complex legacy as a new generation of musicians discovers his work.</p> <p>In the 1970s, McCartney wasn't the only superstar to recognise Fela's musical innovations, the way in which he fused high-life and jazz with the rhythms of funk to create 'Afrobeat'. When James Brown toured Nigeria in 1970, bassist William 'Bootsy' Collins recalls, '[Fela] had a club in Lagos, and we came to the club and they were treating us like kings. We were telling them they're the funkiest cats we ever heard in our life. I mean, this is the James Brown band, but we were totally wiped out! That was one trip I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.' </p> <p>Tony Allen, Fela's drummer and a key architect of Afrobeat, claims that Brown sent his arranger, David Mathews, to check him out. 'He watches the movement of my legs and the movement of my hands, and he starts writing down ... They picked a lot from Fela when they came to Nigeria. It's like both of them sort of influenced each other. Fela got influenced in America, James Brown got the influence in Africa.' </p> <p>Fela's influence spread in all kinds of directions. Gilberto Gil, now the Minister of Culture in Brazil, says that meeting Fela in Lagos changed his life ('I felt like I was a tree replanted and able to flourish'). Brian Eno once told me that he owned more albums by Fela than by any other artist and that he listened to him 'over and over again'. Indeed, his one musical regret was that he never managed to produce a Fela record; he had been known to lie awake at night dreaming of what such a record would sound like. It was another musician, Viv Albertine of the Slits, who first turned me on to Fela in the early Eighties and I too became obsessed with the man, puzzled as to why he wasn't one of the biggest stars in the world. </p> <p>Born on 15 October, 1938, Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti was the fourth of five children in a middle-class family. His father, the Reverend Israel Ransome-Kuti, was the first president of the Nigerian Union Of Teachers; his mother, Funmilayo, was a political activist and feminist, also known as the first woman in Nigeria to drive a car and as the recipient of a Lenin Peace Prize who travelled to Russia and China and met Chairman Mao. His grandfather, an Anglican pastor, who encouraged Fela from an early age, had been one of the first West Africans to have his music commercially recorded, including a series of hymns in Yoruba for EMI's Zonophone label made on a trip to London in 1925.</p> <p>In 1958 Fela himself was sent to London - possibly to study medicine, though he enrolled at Trinity College of Music instead. For the next four years, he studied piano, composition and theory, and made a name on the R&amp;B club scene with his jazz and highlife band, Koola Lobitos. In 1961, he married his first wife Remi, with whom he had a son, Femi. According to JK Braimah, a friend at the time, '[He] was a nice guy, a really beautiful guy. But as square as they come. He didn't smoke cigarettes, let alone grass. He was afraid to fuck! We had to take his prick by hand, hold it and put it in for him, I swear!' </p> <p>In January 1984, when I first met Fela, at the Russell Hotel in Bloomsbury, central London, I asked him which musician he most respected. The answer was unexpected. 'Handel. George Frederick Handel.' I told him my father was a Handel freak and we discussed, amid the dope smoke, Dixit Dominus and the Concerto Grossi. </p> <p>Thinking about it, I decided a comparison wasn't improbable. In Fela's music there is the same mix of solidity and transcendence, and I thought I could detect echoes of the composer in Fela's organ lines. He told me he thought he was writing 'African classical music'. </p> <p>'Western music is Bach, Handel and Schubert - it's good music, cleverly done - as a musician I can see that. Classical music gives musicians a kick. But African music gives everyone a kick. Once you get music with a beat, that is African music. </p> <p>'Jazz was the beginning of rhythm music, which developed into rock and roll. But what the jazz musicians lost because they were so far from their homeland was the intricate rhythms of African music.' </p> <p>Can Europeans play African music, I asked? 'I tell you something. When I was in London 20 years ago the white boys couldn't dance, now they dance quite well.' </p> <p>Returning to Lagos, Fela worked as a trainee radio producer with Nigerian Broadcasting, and re-formed Koola Lobitos. But it was the band's first trip to the USA in 1969 that saw the sound really change, while Fela began a personal evolution, talking the language of revolution for the first time. Broke, depressed and working as an illegal immigrant now his visa had expired, he met Sandra Smith at one of the band's gigs at New York's Ambassador Hotel. She was a member of the Black Panther Party, the pair became lovers and she turned him on to Eldridge Cleaver and Malcolm X, persuading him to write 'conscious' lyrics. </p> <p>Fela's band, now called Africa 70, came into its own back in Lagos - the hits started coming, Fela coined the term 'Afrobeat' and set up a kind of hippie commune in a large house. Upwards of 100 people lived there - the band, roadies and anyone involved with the nightclub Fela set up, originally called the Afro-Spot and then the Shrine. And Fela became a hero of the underclass. A typical swipe at the ruling elite was found on the song 'Gentleman', on which he ridiculed those who wore western fashions in Africa: </p> <p>'Him put him socks him put him shoes, him put him pants him put him singlet, him put him trouser him put him shirt, him put him tie, him put him coat, him cover over all with him hat; him go sweat all over, him go faint right down, him go smell like shit. ' </p> <p>The authorities responded by sending the army to arrest Fela, razing his home almost to the ground. Fela promptly recorded a track titled after the Lagos prison ('Alagbon Close'), spoofing the authorities. </p> <p>When I walked into Fela's hotel room on that cold January afternoon, the self-styled Black President, The One Who Emanates Greatness, Carries Death In His Quiver and Cannot Be Killed By Human Entity was wearing just a pair of red underpants, smoking a cigar-sized spliff and watching a B-movie. The 22-year old Femi was there too along with three wives and Professor Hindu (aka a Ghanaian called Kwaku Addaie). </p> <p>At a show at London's Town and Country Club that week, the Professor, to the bafflement of a sceptical audience, had cut his own tongue, magicked watches and clothes from nowhere and asked for a volunteer from the audience whose throat he seemed to cut before burying him outside the venue in a grave he had dug earlier. Two days later 200 people witnessed the volunteer's disinterment; he explained that being buried makes people extremely horny and propositioned the music journalist Vivien Goldman, pleading: 'I have money. Plenty money' and waving a hotel key. </p> <p>'Everything was going against me,' Fela said of Hindu. 'Since I met him four years ago, I've seen so much spiritual light.' Fela said Hindu knows the past and the future, and he used him to talk to his dead mother each night. </p> <p>I had come to know Fela through records such as 'Algabon Close' and 'Zombie'. You could make a case for 1976's most revolutionary record being not 'Anarchy In The UK' but this second, perfectly conceived slice of pop subversion, with its killer groove sounding like no one else, thunderous brass with wonderful trumpet from Lester Bowie and lyrics in pidgin English attacking the mindlessness of the Nigerian military ('Zombie no go turn unless you tell am to turn/Zombie no go think unless you tell to think ...'). </p> <p>Fela's robotic stage moves had been copied by protesters in riots against the government; he was banned from Ghana for being 'liable to cause a breach of the peace' and this song provoked an attack on his new commune, named by Fela the Kalakuta ('Rascal') Republic. Indeed, Fela had declared independence from the repressive Nigerian state. On 18 February 1977, more than 1,000 armed soldiers surrounded the compound, set fire to the generator, and brutalised the occupants. Fela alleged he was dragged by his genitals from the main house, beaten, and only escaped death following the intervention of a commanding officer. Many women were raped and the 78-year-old Funmilayo was thrown through a window. She subsequently died. </p> <p>Fela kept up the polemic, delivering his mother's coffin to the army barracks and writing the song 'Coffin for Head of State' . One of his masterpieces, 'Unknown Soldier', followed an official inquiry that claimed the commune was destroyed by 'an exasperated and unknown soldier'. </p> <p>According to John Collins, who knew Fela in the 1970s and is the author of Fela: Africa's Musical Warrior, published next month: 'In his songs [Fela] went much further than the usual round-up of protest singers such as Bob Dylan, James Brown or Bob Marley. Fela's songs not only protested against various forms of injustice but often fiercely attacked specific agencies and members of the Nigerian government.' His targets even included the US multinational International Telephones and TeleCommunications, on 'International Thief Thief (ITT)'. </p> <p>In 1978, Fela had set up an organisation called Movement For The People and said he wanted to run for president but the authorities kept him off the ballot by various legal stratagems. I asked him, when we met, if he thought he could ever be president of Nigeria. 'Spiritually speaking, every human being has a destiny and a duty to perform,' he said. 'No African has ever seen anything like me - they see me sticking to my guns through all the violence. </p> <p>'In the last military regime I was the only one to speak out against the government and the army. Anything could happen in Nigeria. If they get to the point that everyone trying to rule the place isn't making any headway they might drop their guard and ask, \"Fela, do you want to rule us today?\"' </p> <p>So what sort of regime would he run? </p> <p>'It would be a cultural and spiritual revolution. Every individual would feel like a president - nothing would obstruct people getting what is due to them.' </p> <p>The fumes in the room were getting thick. I was trying not to look at his wives, nor seem that I was deliberately not looking at them. Also in 1978, to mark the anniversary of the pillage of Kalakuta, he married 27 of his dancers simultaneously. Fela claimed this was a traditional Yoruba ceremony, although some priests disputed this, pointing out that no bride prices were paid, and there is a suggestion that some sort of immigration scam was also involved. It was certainly a fabulous publicity stunt, although as DJ Rita Ray, who now runs a Fela-inspired club called Shrine in London, points out, 'Dancers weren't held in high esteem, so his argument was that he was making them respectable. He was wild, but very progressive.' </p> <p>In our meeting, I asked him about the importance of sex. 'Sex is one of the most important things in life, man. It's Christianity and Islam that have made sex immoral. People should be proud to say, \"I had a fantastic fuck last night.\" When a minister in Britain has an affair he loses his job. If a minister in Africa fucks 400 women no one will even notice him, you know.' </p> <p>In songs such as 'Lady' and 'Mattress' the impression he gave was that women were inferior. 'I'm not saying that women should not be political leaders,' he said. 'Women can do what they want - but once she's married in Africa she can't do anything against her husband's will. If a woman doesn't like a man she should find another - that's why polygamy is so fantastic ... An African man should not do anything called housework or cooking ...' But, Fela, cooking can be fun, I persisted. 'I can cook, I had to as a student in London. But if I have a party and do cooking, people call me a 'Less Man'. I don't see why I should go against the cultural values of my people.' </p> <p>So what is the gay scene like in Lagos? 'I've seen a few boys behave like sissies, you know. I found they had gone to England and been corrupted. If you are gay in Africa no one must know about it - they will stone you to death, man.' </p> <p>Fela claimed Aids was a 'white man's disease', but he caught the virus and died from complications on 2 August, 1997, at the age of 58. At the time we met, 12 of his 27 wives remained - he told me he employed a rota system to keep them satisfied - but following a 27-month jail sentence that began later that year (on a trumped up charge of currency smuggling) he divorced them all. 'Marriage brings jealousy and selfishnessness,' he was quoted as saying. His manager, Rikki Stein, maintains 'sex was where his inspiration came from, and considering the number of great albums he made ... In the Eighties, on tour, I witnessed fur-wrapped beauties queuing up for their turn ...' </p> <p>Fela's last song had been called 'C.S.A.S (Condom Scallywag and Scatter )', which described the use of condoms as 'un-African'. To the end, Fela refused to be tested to determine the cause of his weight loss and skin lesions. After much discussion among the family after his death, his brother, Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, publicly disclosed the cause, paradoxically enabling, as one commentator put it, 'Aids awareness in Nigeria to leave the dark ages'. In that sense, Fela's death helped save a lot of lives, although it's impossible to know how many women he himself put in mortal danger by his wilful denial of his disease. Stein says 'one or two women in Fela's entourage became ill, though I don't know whether it had anything to do with Fela. All the rest are still going strong, as I understand it. They say it was Aids. I say that he died of one beating too many. He was a giant of a man, but a man nevertheless.' It might otherwise be observed that it was a wilful contrariness - the same impulse that always animated Fela - that ultimately killed him. </p> <p>More than a million mourners filled the streets of Lagos. Towards the end of his life, as his energy waned, Fela was less involved with political crusades. Nonetheless, according to Femi Kuti: 'For two days, people didn't do any work in Lagos! This is the first time in the history of Lagos they have not had a complaint of robbery, rape or anything. Because all the robbers, the bad boys, they loved him, you know? Everybody was busy at the funeral.' </p> <p>One irony is that Fela, if anything, is more popular world-wide than when he was alive - his music is sampled by producers like Timbaland (on Missy Elliott's 'Watcha Gonna Do'), while Damon Albarn voted 'Zombie' the 'sexiest ever track' in a recent poll. In fact, the Blur singer is now working in Lagos on a project with Tony Allen. </p> <p>And Femi Kuti carries the family torch with his own band, Positive Force, while another son, Seun - a recent graduate of the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, the 'fame academy' endowed by Paul McCartney - fronts a version of Fela's old group Egypt 80. </p> <p>I spoke to Seun on the day he was supposed to be at his graduation ceremony, where he would have met Sir Paul. Instead, Seun - who's anti-marriage, and pro-dope, rebellion and black consciousness - leapt on a plane to Lagos. He said he had better things to do. </p> <p>Fela Kuti's biographer Michael Veal worried that 'Fela's message of African empowerment became increasingly intertwined with dominant racist stereotypes of the African as vulgar, intoxicated, primitive, hypersexualised and indigenous mystic.' </p> <p>For the 20-year old Seun, his father 'was a gift, an inspiration to Africa; there will never be another like him. But things in Nigeria are even worse now, and however hard it is to live up to his legacy, we have to carry on the fight for liberation and consciousness'. Both Positive Force and Egypt 80 will be appearing at the Barbican's Fela Kuti season. </p> <p>Did Fela ever fail himself? It is not likely that he ever felt that way, he told me he was a fatalist. 'Even death doesn't worry me, man. When my mother died it was because she finished her time on earth. I know that when I die I'll see her again, so how can I fear death?' </p> <p>'So what is this motherfucking world about? I believe there is a plan ... What I am experiencing today completely vindicates the African religions ... I will do my part ... then I'll just go, man. Just go!'</p> <p><strong>Fela: a life of struggle</strong></p> <p><strong>1938</strong> Born 15 October in Abeokuta, Nigeria to politically active and middle class family. </p> <p><strong>1958 </strong> Sent to London to train as a doctor, but instead enrolled in the Trinity College of Music.

  "<p>PaulMcCartney found himself in Lagos in August 1972. The plan had been to record a new record - the record that became Band on the Run - at somewhere other than Abbey Road and EMI had offered one of its studios in Rio de Janeiro or Peking. Instead, the former Beatle insisted on the Nigerian capital, picturing himself 'lying on the beach all day doing nothing and recording at night'.</p> <p>As he drily noted later, 'it didn't turn out quite like that', what with being held up at knife point, the lepers in the streets, the omnipresent military, the corruption and the lack of security. Still, Lagos had its attractions. Chief among these was the chance to check out Fela Ransome-Kuti's band - 'the best band I've ever seen live...When Fela and his band eventually began to play, after a long, crazy build-up, I just couldn't stop weeping with joy. It was a very moving experience.'</p> <p>Thrilled by his experience, McCartney thought of recording with some of the musicians working with the extraordinary 33-year-old firebrand. When Fela caught wind of the plan he denounced McCartney from the stage of his club and then arrived unannounced at the studio to berate him for 'stealing black man's music'.</p> <p>As McCartney said at the time: 'We were gonna use African musicians, but when we were told we were about to pinch the music we thought, \"Well, up to you, we'll do it ourselves.\" Fela thought we were stealing black African music, the Lagos sound. So I had to say, \"Do us a favour, Fela, we do OK. We're all right as it is. We sell a couple of records here and there.\"</p> <p>'I thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to Lagos and people would say, \"Oh, by the way, what's the music down there like?\" and I'd say it was unbelievable. It is unbelievable...it's incredible music down there. I think it will come to the fore.'</p> <p>The incident caused a brief storm in Lagos, and illustrates Fela's fearlessness, his love of controversy and an unerring ability to piss on his own parade. When Motown wanted to set up an African label in the early 1980s, it offered Fela a million-dollar deal. This despite his insistence at the time of recording radio-hostile 60-minute songs, and never playing old material, so that live audiences would never hear his hits.</p> <p>Rikki Stein, one of his then managers, was hugely excited and flew to Lagos to discuss the deal. Stein says that Fela's response was to contact the spirits via his personal magician, Professor Hindu. The spirits refused to let him sign for another two years and Fela further insisted on only leasing his back catalogue. 'Even then, Motown went along with it. But after two years, in April 1985, the very month that Fela was about to sign, the Motown guy got sacked and the deal was off,' says Stein. 'Maybe the spirits knew something.'</p> <p>Certainly, Fela Kuti was the ultimate rebel, a spiritualist , pan-African revolutionary and a prodigious dope smoker and polygamist. Harassed, beaten and tortured by the authorities, he was a dancer, a saxophonist and a composer. He called himself 'Abami Edo', the strange one, the weird one. He dropped the Ransome part of his name - asking 'Do I look like an Englishman?' - and changed his surname to Anikulapo ('one who carries death in the pouch'). He also billed himself as the Black President, the Chief of the Shrine. Seven years after his death, the mysteries surrounding him continue to unravel, and a season of events at the Barbican in London this autumn will celebrate his complex legacy as a new generation of musicians discovers his work.</p> <p>In the 1970s, McCartney wasn't the only superstar to recognise Fela's musical innovations, the way in which he fused high-life and jazz with the rhythms of funk to create 'Afrobeat'. When James Brown toured Nigeria in 1970, bassist William 'Bootsy' Collins recalls, '[Fela] had a club in Lagos, and we came to the club and they were treating us like kings. We were telling them they're the funkiest cats we ever heard in our life. I mean, this is the James Brown band , but we were totally wiped out! That was one trip I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.'</p> <p>Tony Allen, Fela's drummer and a key architect of Afrobeat, claims that Brown sent his arranger, David Mathews, to check him out. 'He watches the movement of my legs and the movement of my hands, and he starts writing down... They picked a lot from Fela when they came to Nigeria. It's like both of them sort of influenced each other. Fela got influenced in America, James Brown got the influence in Africa.'</p> <p>Fela's influence spread in all kinds of directions. Gilberto Gil, now the Minister of Culture in Brazil, says that meeting Fela in Lagos changed his life ('I felt like I was a tree replanted and able to flourish'). Brian Eno once told me that he owned more albums by Fela than by any other artist and that he listened to him 'over and over again'. Indeed, his one musical regret was that he never managed to produce a Fela record he had been known to lie awake at night dreaming of what such a record would sound like. It was another musician, Viv Albertine of the Slits, who first turned me on to Fela in the early Eighties and I too became obsessed with the man, puzzled as to why he wasn't one of the biggest stars in the world.</p> <p>BORN ON 15 OCTOBER, 1938, OLUFELA Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti was the fourth of five children in a middle-class family. His father, the Reverend Israel Ransome-Kuti, was the first president of the Nigerian Union Of Teachers his mother, Funmilayo, was a political activist and feminist, also known as the first woman in Nigeria to drive a car and as the recipient of a Lenin Peace Prize who travelled to Russia and China and met Chairman Mao. His grandfather, an Anglican pastor, who encouraged Fela from an early age, had been one of the first West Africans to have his music commercially recorded, including a series of hymns in Yoruba for EMI's Zonophone label made on a trip to London in 1925.</p> <p>In 1958 Fela himself was sent to London - possibly to study medicine, though he enrolled at Trinity College of Music instead. For the next four years, he studied piano, composition and theory, and made a name on the R&amp;B club scene with his jazz and highlife band, Koola Lobitos. In 1961, he married his first wife Remi, with whom he had a son, Femi. According to JK Braimah, a friend at the time, '[He] was a nice guy, a really beautiful guy. But as square as they come. He didn't smoke cigarettes, let alone grass. He was afraid to fuck! We had to take his prick by hand, hold it and put it in for him, I swear!'</p> <p>In January 1984, when I first met Fela, at the Russell Hotel in Bloomsbury, central London, I asked him which musician he most respected. The answer was unexpected. 'Handel. George Frederick Handel.' I told him my father was a Handel freak and we discussed, amid the dope smoke, Dixit Dominus and the Concerto Grossi.</p> <p>Thinking about it, I decided a comparison wasn't improbable. In Fela's music there is the same mix of solidity and transcendence, and I thought I could detect echoes of the composer in Fela's organ lines. He told me he thought he was writing 'African classical music'.</p> <p>'Western music is Bach, Handel and Schubert - it's good music, cleverly done - as a musician I can see that. Classical music gives musicians a kick. But African music gives everyone a kick. Once you get music with a beat, that is African music.</p> <p>'Jazz was the beginning of rhythm music, which developed into rock and roll. But what the jazz musicians lost because they were so far from their homeland was the intricate rhythms of African music.'</p> <p>Can Europeans play African music, I asked? 'I tell you something. When I was in London 20 years ago the white boys couldn't dance, now they dance quite well.'</p> <p>RETURNING TO LAGOS, FELA WORKED AS A trainee radio producer with Nigerian Broadcasting, and re-formed Koola Lobitos. But it was the band's first trip to the USA in 1969 that saw the sound really change, while Fela began a personal evolution, talking the language of revolution for the first time. Broke, depressed and working as an illegal immigrant now his visa had expired, he met Sandra Smith at one of the band's gigs at New York's Ambassador Hotel. She was a member of the Black Panther Party, the pair became lovers and she turned him on to Eldridge Cleaver and Malcolm X, persuading him to write 'conscious' lyrics.</p> <p>Fela's band, now called Africa 70, came into its own back in Lagos - the hits started coming, Fela coined the term 'Afrobeat' and set up a kind of hippie commune in a large house. Upwards of 100 people lived there - the band, roadies and anyone involved with the nightclub Fela set up, originally called the Afro-Spot and then the Shrine. And Fela became a hero of the underclass. A typical swipe at the ruling elite was found on the song 'Gentleman', on which he ridiculed those who wore western fashions in Africa:</p> <p>'Him put him socks him put him shoes, him put him pants him put him singlet, him put him trouser him put him shirt, him put him tie, him put him coat, him cover over all with him hat him go sweat all over, him go faint right down, him go smell like shit. '</p> <p>The authorities responded by sending the army to arrest Fela, razing his home almost to the ground. Fela promptly recorded a track titled after the Lagos prison ('Alagbon Close'), spoofing the authorities.</p> <p>When I walked into Fela's hotel room on that cold January afternoon, the self-styled Black President, The One Who Emanates Greatness, Carries Death In His Quiver and Cannot Be Killed By Human Entity was wearing just a pair of red underpants, smoking a cigar-sized spliff and watching a B-movie.

Fela said Hindu knows the past and the future, and he used him to talk to his dead mother each night.</p> <p>I had come to know Fela through records such as 'Algabon Close' and 'Zombie'. You could make a case for 1976's most revolutionary record being not 'Anarchy In The UK' but this second, perfectly conceived slice of pop subversion, with its killer groove sounding like no one else, thunderous brass with wonderful trumpet from Lester Bowie and lyrics in pidgin English attacking the mindlessness of the Nigerian military ('Zombie no go turn unless you tell am to turn/Zombie no go think unless you tell to think...').</p> <p>Fela's robotic stage moves had been copied by protesters in riots against the government he was banned from Ghana for being 'liable to cause a breach of the peace' and this song provoked an attack on his new commune, named by Fela the Kalakuta ('Rascal') Republic.

In fact, the Blur singer is now working in Lagos on a project with Tony Allen.</p> <p>And Femi Kuti carries the family torch with his own band, Positive Force, while another son, Seun - a recent graduate of the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, the 'fame academy' endowed by Paul McCartney - fronts a version of Fela's old group Egypt 80.</p> <p>I spoke to Seun on the day he was supposed to be at his graduation ceremony, where he would have met Sir Paul. Instead, Seun - who's anti-marriage, and pro-dope, rebellion and black consciousness - leapt on a plane to Lagos. He said he had better things to do.</p> <p>Fela Kuti's biographer Michael Veal worried that 'Fela's message of African empowerment became increasingly intertwined with dominant racist stereotypes of the African as vulgar, intoxicated, primitive, hypersexualised and indigenous mystic.'</p> <p>For the 20-year old Seun, his father 'was a gift, an inspiration to Africa there will never be another like him. But things in Nigeria are even worse now, and however hard it is to live up to his legacy, we have to carry on the fight for liberation and consciousness'. Both Positive Force and Egypt 80 will be appearing at the Barbican's Fela Kuti season.</p> <p>Did Fela ever fail himself? It is not likely that he ever felt that way, he told me he was a fatalist. 'Even death doesn't worry me, man. When my mother died it was because she finished her time on earth. I know that when I die I'll see her again, so how can I fear death?'</p> <p>'So what is this motherfucking world about? I believe there is a plan.... What I am experiencing today completely vindicates the African religions.... I will do my part... then I'll just go, man. Just go!'</p> <p>'Black President', a season of events celebrating the music, art and legacy of Fela Kuti, is at the Barbican Centre, London EC2, 9 September until 24 October.

  "<p>Look, I just want to do it, that's all,' says my wife, who is 'doing' a car boot sale, and wonders why I'm standing in her way in at least two unhelpful senses while she struggles past me with our pre-Falklands fondue set, 'World's Best Dad' coffee mug and selection of fully interlocking but not necessarily complete children's jigsaws. </p> <p>'I might make some money. What's so terrible about that?' </p> <p>'Absolutely nothing,' I say, though I feel one of us should be wondering whether this is a suitable activity for a woman still in thrall to a mid-1970s public service ethos that regards profit-making as the evil business of right-wing, moustache-twirling blazer-wearers, and has previously shown amazement that people could want to prostitute themselves earning substantial salaries working for a successful newspaper group, with its subsidised canteens, Bupa cover and lunchtime Tai Chi sessions, when they could be locked up for hours in a classroom and forced to eat school dinners. </p> <p>Although, come to think of it, we did once spend three months traipsing up and down the beach in the south of France trying to get rich by selling ice creams. I never expected the girl I married (yes, the one interested in special needs children and who has become the new Queen Mother of not knowing how much petrol costs) to be one day shouting her wares like a fishwife from a market stall in a disused Essex car park. </p> <p>Perhaps she has merely been slow to inherit the entrepreneurial spirit of her late father, Kevin, who as a young man sold hearing aids door-to-door (how did he get anyone to answer?) before going on to build his own TV rental empire and who bought us a Vauxhall Nova to celebrate the trauma of having to take our first baby on holiday to Cornwall. But no. The truth is, this isn't about money at all. It's about her getting out of the house and leaving me cooped up with the kids all day for a change.</p> <p>'Bring them along,' she trills, driving off with our ex-neighbour Tim, with whom she is pooling capital resources - ie, our car and his wallpapering table. She doesn't mean it but, hey, it's an idea, so as soon as our youngest two have got bored of whatever is temporarily failing to give them something to complain about, I pack them into the little car and off we go. </p> <p>Although my wife has been careful not to give us the address, we find it simply by eliminating all the addresses on the Harlow Circular that it isn't. We are soon choosing a tree to park in and joining the holiday crowds. It's at this point - shortly after the children have stopped asking if we're here yet and started asking how long we have to stay - that I find myself musing on how one would explain to a more advanced civilisation (the Sardinians, say) how wandering around in the blazing heat inspecting other people's old flowery lampshades and warped LPs counts as a fine day out for all the family. </p> <p>The good news is that my wife and Tim have made an excellent start, she buying his Vileda mop head and he our wooden railway set. Tim, though - technically in the red after unwisely straying from his post and returning with The Luftwaffe Handbook - is worried now that people might not appreciate the full adaptability of his high chair (\u00a310) and has duly made a sign saying 'Legs come off'. </p> <p>He is surprised, too, at the poor response to his breast pump (one careful owner) and series of luridly jacketed cowboy novellas. 'Can I interest you in Buffalo Valley?' he is asking someone. A woman, meanwhile, is inquiring about my wife's glove puppets. 'How much?' </p> <p>'Two pounds each.' </p> <p>'What if I take all four?' </p> <p>'Ten pounds,' my wife says brightly. </p> <p>It could be a long day. </p> <p>phil.hogan@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "<p>From the world of projectiles going at alarming speeds comes a couple of near-birth and near-death experiences. First, there is <strong>Cornelia Pfohl</strong> in the women's archery, who is six months pregnant with her first child. Pfohl, a German soldier, adjusted her balance at the oche in the qualifying round to earn herself a seeding of eighteenth. Meanwhile, in the trap shooting there is 43-year-old Bret Erickson, another with a military background. Just three weeks ago, Sergeant First Class Erickson, of the US Army Marksmanship Unit, keeled over on the range with a heart attack. He received life-saving resuscitation on the spot and almost immediately afterwards was fitted with a pacemaker. And here he is in Athens, blasting away at full bore. </p> <p><strong>Stat of the week</strong>: 403 - the number of BBC personnel in Athens covering the Games. In contrast, there are 271 competitors in the Great Britain team. As one rival broadcaster remarked: \"That means that there's one-and-a-half BBC people here to cover just the reserve goalie in the GB hockey team.\" Nice work if you can get it. </p> <p>At an opulent media lunch in Athens laid on by his sponsor, Visa, <strong>Sir Steve Redgrave</strong> revealed the main danger of life in the Olympic Village: becoming a fat git. \"Competitors have too much time on their hands and can easily end up in the food hall all the time eating too much and putting on quite a lot of weight,\" said Sir Steve, sporting a slight paunch that has grown since he quit rowing. \"In Barcelona in 1992, there were free Magnum ice creams in the village. Research afterwards showed that athletes had eaten an average of eight each.\"</p> <p><strong>Rower Cath Bishop</strong>, from Leigh-on-Sea, will resume her other career as a diplomat in Sarajevo when she crosses the finish line on Lake Schinias on Saturday - win or lose. An Essex girl turned Cambridge PhD graduate with a passion for the piano and clarinet, Bishop took up rowing and raced in Atlanta as a member of the Britain eight, finishing seventh. Two years later she won a world silver medal and went to Sydney with high hopes but failed to make the final. </p> <p>A disappointing fifth place followed in 2001 and she quit rowing in disgust to go into the European Union department of the Foreign Office, as an aptitude for languages signalled a promising career in Whitehall. </p> <p>But the lure of the Olympics, coupled with a feeling of unfinished business and the persuasiveness of 2000 Olympic silver medal-winner Katherine Grainger (a lawyer in training), tempted Bishop back into a boat last year and they won the coxless pair world title, beating the world and Olympic pair champions from Romania. Now 'Cath and Kath' are seeking Britain's first Olympic women's title, here in Athens, and they believe that the close understanding that they have in and out of the boat will see them through. </p> <p>\"It's a bit like a marriage,\" says Bishop. \"We seem to know what the other is thinking.\" Bishop finished her last lesson in Serbo-Croat over the phone on Monday and can now concentrate on producing the golden performance that eluded her four years ago. </p> <p>Probably the most hated person in Athens, at least by the hosts, is <strong>Laura Peek</strong>, a reporter with The Times who has infuriated the Greeks with a series of articles lambasting stadium construction delays and security weaknesses and generally portraying these Olympics as a disaster waiting to happen (or not happen). But no more. </p> <p>Peek, back in Athens for the Games, has apparently been told to change her tune. \"She's been instructed to be much more on-message, to stop slagging the Games and generally be a lot more positive,\" says a Times insider. \"A piece she wrote about the lack of foreign visitors in Athens was turned into almost a tourist brochure for the city.\" The Greeks will be happy.</p>",
  "<p>The only time I met Jeffrey Archer, he was ranting about the Greeks. 'These bloody people, they couldn't organise their way out of a paper bag.' </p> <p>It was the eve of the 1997 World Athletics Championships in Athens. Archer was standing in the foyer of the Hilton, fuming because an overworked saleswoman in the hotel bookshop had had the temerity to keep him waiting. 'To think that they're organising these games is a real joke,' he grumbled. 'They're bloody hopeless.' His tirade was embarrassing. But what struck me more, living in Greece and being British, was the ferocity of such Anglo-Saxon condescension. It was both disquieting and buffoonish. In the event, the championships were the best of recent times. </p> <p>As Greeks defy sceptics with world-class sports venues and a vastly improved city for the Olympics, I wonder what put-downs Archer and his ilk will come up with now? That Athens 2004 isn't a patch on what London could be in 2012? Or perhaps they will take a leaf out of Tessa Jowell's book? After touring the Greek capital last week, the British sports minister could only exclaim: 'We are here to learn ... and support the city in the face of doomsayers - they have turned it around.' </p> <p>Greece is the smallest country to stage the Olympics, which are the biggest ever. The feat will help dispel some of the self-doubt and nagging inferiorities that torment Greeks. Not even the humiliation of seeing the farcical flight from drug testers of their two star athletes could take the gloss off Friday's magnificent opening ceremony. </p> <p>If the Games go as well and remain incident-free - and the Greeks have spent a record \u00a3900 million providing security for the event - the organisers may just succeed in proving that Athens is no longer Europe's Christian Orthodox 'odd-man out'. That, actually, it can very effectively 'organise its way out of a paper bag'. But will the Olympics also change the prejudices against Hellenes? </p> <p>In Britain, it seems, there is still a readiness to think of the Greeks as barely civilised: they are all called Zorba, sport bushy moustaches and smash plates. If not that, then they are corrupt southern Europeans with a criminal justice system that goes out of its way to target British plane spotters. Such stereotypes are born of an idea of Greece as a Balkan backwater, a country that has no place in the European Union. </p> <p>Again and again, in the course of reporting from Greece, I have met such prejudices. What still surprises me, though, is the extent to which they appear to have colonised the minds of people I might otherwise respect. </p> <p>A year spent in the irrepressibly progressive environment of Harvard, as the new century dawned, only served to highlight how entrenched and peculiarly British such views tend to be. Like our fondness for that cliche of Greeks bearing gifts, we seem unable to abandon our belief that modern Greece is a contradiction in terms. Increasingly, I find myself thinking the British, rather than the Greeks, are trapped in outdated mindsets. </p> <p>As a Briton, I find much to squirm about, whether it's the Elgin marbles or my compatriots running wild in vomit-splattered Faliraki or feckless, bare-breasted English girls being incarcerated in Greek jails, which are, naturally, described as 'medieval' in the British press. </p> <p>Few ever stop to think how the British might behave if hordes of unprepossessing, out-of-control Greeks invaded our coasts? More often than not, Greek authorities react to such excesses with a leniency far beyond the call of duty. </p> <p>No one can deny the Greeks' bewildering last-minute work ethic. In recent months, preparations for the Games appeared so chaotic that they bordered on the burlesque. But, sadly, stereotypes tend to colour political views. </p> <p>What people tend to forget is just how far the Greeks have come. Three decades ago, Athens was under the iron grip of small-minded military dictators, men as intent on banning mini-skirts as banishing leftists to remote island prisons. </p> <p>Now, Hellenes worry not about human rights or the rule of law, but consumer goods and their second homes overlooking the sea. It is all the more miraculous when you remember that before the colonels came years of wars, coups and near-constant political and social unrest. </p> <p>It is true that with their extraordinary ability to be their own worst enemy, the tumult was often self-inflicted. The disastrous 1923 Pelepponese campaign, subject of Louis de Berni\u00e8re's latest book, did not enhance the country's reputation. Nor did Athens's fiercely pro-Serbian and less than magnanimous stance in the recent Balkan wars. </p> <p>But Greece is changing. Just as the country is no longer the economic laggard of the European Union (at around 4 per cent, its GDP growth rates are the second highest in the eurozone), it is no longer the political juvenile of yore. The trenchant nationalism of the 1980s and early 1990s is no more; instead of generating firebrand politicians with only thinly disguised dreams of conquering Constantinople, it produces men and women who want only to improve relations with Turkey. </p> <p>Progressive immigration policies, an area for which Greece deserves more credit, are rapidly changing the country's ethnic make-up. Around 10 per cent of its 11-million strong population are now foreign-born, mostly Albanian, although increasingly from the former Soviet republics, Africa and the Middle East. Admittedly, Greece was never a multicultural paradise; treatment of newcomers has not always been exemplary. But I have often wondered what the reaction would be in other European countries to such a great influx. </p> <p>In years to come, others might contemplate the wisdom of tasking small states such as Greece with the organisation of a show such as the Olympics. But of one thing there can be no doubt: no other single event has so effectively transformed or revitalised Athens in the 180-plus years since Greece won independence from the Ottoman Turks. </p> <p>In one fell swoop, it seems, the Greeks have cleaned up their act. They have cracked the nasty November 17 (the group that killed British military attache Stephen Saunders); they've used EU funds and dug deep into their coffers to build highways, a sophisticated transport network, a gleaming new airport and a metro system that makes the London Underground look primitive. </p> <p>They haven't built a new Acropolis Museum yet, but they've united all their ancient masterpieces into a giant and spectacular archaeological park, no mean feat in a city of more than four million people. How long has it taken to even agree to build London's Crossrail? It is unlikely it will be ready by 2012. </p> <p>The new Greeks are innovative. In contrast to the patronising eggheads who govern the likes of the British Museum, they come up with forward-looking polices: 'Why not loan us the Elgin marbles, instead of 'giving them back' and we'll display them in a branch of the British Museum beneath the Parthenon?' </p> <p>Lovers of Greece will weep to see that acceptance has taken so long, but it could prove to be one of the greatest legacies of the Games. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Will Hutton is away</p>",

Hamm, widely regarded as the best female player in the world, fired home a 58th-minute penalty in her 262nd appearance to break the deadlock in Thessaloniki. </p> <p>Abby Wambach added a second in the 77th minute with a superb solo goal - her 16th in the past 17 games - as the 1999 World Cup winners made it two victories out of two in Greece. She beat two defenders along the right flank and put a left-foot shot inside the near post.</p> <p>The Americans, silver medallists in Sydney four years ago, now have six points in Group G, having beaten hosts Greece 3-0 in midweek.

Heather Galliock led them to victory virtually to assure them of a place in the quarter-finals.

  "<p>Eidur Gudjohnsen has become a member of the old guard at Chelsea. Having lasted four years, he is among an elite few whose memories stretch as far back as the days when Gianluca Vialli was manager and Ken Bates owned the Bridge. </p> <p>As Chelsea, in the first years of the twenty-first century, have transformed themselves from bankrupt to bankrolled, major players on the international stage, they have dispensed with dozens of Gudjohnsen's former team-mates. The great survivor, though, recently signed a new four-year, \u00a355,000-a-week contract. The new Chelsea manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has praised him like a favoured son, calling Gudjohnsen 'special' and 'intelligent', essentially indispensable. Is he, though? </p> <p>With Mateja Kezman and Didier Drogba joining the squad, what are the chances of the Icelandic forward lasting another four years? Kezman's statistics are enough to send even the most confident of strikers whimpering into a corner: 105 goals in 112 appearances for PSV Eindhoven. Gudjohnsen is happy to acknowledge the achievement. \"Wow! You have to admire that,\" he says. </p> <p>But he is not intimidated. \"Look at it this way, the first year I signed for Chelsea there was Tore Andre Flo, there was Zola, the best ever Chelsea player; Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink signed in the same week for \u00a315million, and then there was me, a young, talented boy coming from Bolton. I took that challenge. Last year it was me and Jimmy, and then Adrian [Mutu] and Hernan [Crespo] came in and I still ended up being first choice towards the end of the season. I might not always be in from the start, but I always seem to grind out my place in the team.\"</p> <p>Gudjohnsen started 'grinding out' his place from a remarkably young age. He was top scorer at his club, Valur Reykjavik, at 15, and signed for PSV at 16, where he famously partnered Ronaldo. Breaking into the first team during his second season at PSV, he made two appearances alongside the world's most famous forward, taking his place even, when Ronaldo was injured. Then, suddenly, it looked all over. In an Iceland youth international against Ireland, Gudjohnsen suffered a career-threatening injury, shattering his ankle. But, as he has shown at Chelsea, Gudjohnsen is a survivor.</p> <p> \"The doctor at PSV told me he thought I'd never play at a high level again. It was a very frustrating time, very difficult. I found it hard mentally and I could feel people around me starting to lose faith.\" A morose Gudjohnsen returned to Iceland and pondered his future. He was 19 years old. Having once been a hero in his native country, Gudjohnsen shakes his head at the memory of his homecoming. \"When I returned I wasn't the player people remembered. I was overweight, it didn't look like I would turn professional again.\" </p> <p>Oskar Thorvaldsson, sports editor for Iceland's daily newspaper Dagbladid Visir , recalls Gudjohnsen's early days and the impression he made on the public. \"He was like a prodigy. He played his first game in the league when he was 15 and he instantly became one of the best players. He became a celebrity that year, in 1994. He was the future of Icelandic football, no one had had such an influence on the league before.\" </p> <p>In that doleful year of his return in 1998, the Icelandic public would hardly have recognised him. </p> <p>Released from his contract at PSV, local club KR Reykjavik agreed to sign him. With the help of doctors and physiotherapists he embarked upon an excruciating and at times frightening journey. \"They said try to work through the pain barrier. I was in unbelievable pain. I was chewing painkillers, but gradually I just got through it. Like someone said it's either that or go and try to get a job. Well, I left school at 16...' he shrugs as if to say: \"What else was I going to do?\" </p> <p>\"That time taught me a lot about myself as a person. It was probably a blessing in disguise because you get to know yourself a lot better in difficult periods. I never stopped believing. Belief is a major factor in whatever you do. If you don't believe in yourself no one else will. I thought I'd just go for it and run with the pain, shoot every ball with pain. I started getting fitter and I played 10 or 12 games for Reykjavik. Then I signed for Bolton on a free.\"</p> <p>A single day of training on a pre-season tour of Ireland was all it took to convince the then Bolton manager, Colin Todd, to sign the young forward. Even Gudjohnsen's agent at the time, Peter Harrison, expressed his surprise, saying: \"I don't know what you did in training today but they want to sign you straight away.\" </p> <p>Todd describes his first impressions of Gudjohnsen: \"He didn't look like a star. But his natural talent shone through, his overall movement, his quality to bring people into the game and his ability to get into the box and score goals.\" Talent is one thing, but fitness is entirely another and it took Gudjohnsen a further seven months to break into the Bolton first team as a regular. Todd remembers it as a difficult time for the 20-year-old. </p> <p>\"I did stress to him that he'd need patience, that it would take time to get into the first team. He got a little bit disillusioned, started to lose his enthusiasm. There would be times where he was very depressed. He would sulk, he would put all the blame on the manager. I had to fine him in the end, I fine them quite a bit for going back over the weight. But once he got in the first team, he never looked back.\" </p> <p>Gudjohnsen's first major appearances came towards the end of his first season and immediately he made an impression. Scoring the equalising goal in two successive games earned his team two vital points in the race for the play-offs. It also earned Gudjohnsen a lot of attention in the national press. Signing Gudjohnsen proved a gamble that paid off for Bolton. Twenty-one goals and two seasons later he was sold to Chelsea for a tidy profit of \u00a35m, Tottenham and Newcastle also having shown a keen interest. Rumour has it that even Manchester United had been asking after him. </p> <p>Although clearly not their biggest signing that year, Gudjohnsen proved a shrewd buy for Chelsea, scoring 10 goals in 17 league starts in his first season. Most eye-catching, though, was his fast-developing goal-scoring relationship with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. The two forwards could not have appeared more different, Hasselbaink with his hulking shoulders and fiery eyes, the power in his strike as fearful as his swagger; and Gudjohnsen with his light-footed touch directing through-balls into the Dutchman's path. </p> <p>Gudjohnsen is visibly pleased at the memory. \"We had great chemistry,\" he says, pausing to laugh as though at a private joke. \"We just seemed to be laughing at the same things, silly or not. Ebony and ivory, we had a lot of names... fire and ice people used to call us. Jimmy's more the emotional type on the pitch, the fiery guy, he wants the ball all the time and he will shout and scream at everyone. I'd just say, \"Yeah, relax, I'll give you the ball, don't worry. We respected each other, we complemented each other. I felt at my best when I was providing goals for him.\" </p> <p>An air of nostalgia lurks in this last sentiment, a nod back to a different era. \"When I look back two or three seasons ago, I thought I was unstoppable. I felt like I could control any ball from any angle, see every through-ball, and that's to do with confidence. There was a period when I knew my name was going to be on the team sheet, that's something I'll work hard for again. When that continuity comes hopefully I'll reach the same level and beyond.\" Gudjohnsen and Hasselbaink scored more than 50 goals between them that second season and Gudjohnsen is openly disappointed about the disruption to their work. Although both players were recovering from minor injuries in the close season of 2001, Gudjohnsen feels strongly that Claudio Ranieri should have been more proactive in getting them back to full fitness. </p> <p>\"When you've got a partnership like that you've really got to try to do everything to get it going again. The manager could have done more to get us playing, with Franco [Zola] behind us maybe.\" There are lingering regrets over the Ranieri era, a period of unfulfilled potential as Gudjohnsen sees it. \"I thought four years under Ranieri was a bit of an indifferent time. We didn't reach, I thought, the potential of the team or the squad in those four years.\"</p> <p> The arrival of Mourinho clearly excites Gudjohnsen. \"You have to be impressed by him. This manager is just an out-and-out winner, if he can spread that winning mentality into the squad and into the team it could be our year.\" Having survived uncertain times at Chelsea it is clear just how vital this belief has been for Gudjohnsen. </p> <p>When other players around him were losing their heads and making public their feelings at being left on the bench, Gudjohnsen was able to keep cool and wait his turn. With 27 out of a total of 44 appearances for Chelsea last season having come in the latter half of the year, it was undoubtedly a ploy that paid off for him. </p> <p>Whatever the sceptics may think, Gudjohnsen is clear as to what his role will be in the new Chelsea. \"As long as I'm scoring or setting up goals I feel I'm doing my job. Both Didier [Drogba] and Kezza [Kezman] are out-and-out strikers and if I can be the one helping them to score I'll be glad to do that. I've still got a hell of a lot to offer to Chelsea. With a bit of luck and a lot of confidence I can really blossom.\" </p> <p>His progress will be watched by his family around him. \"My mother knows football and she'll have her opinions, whether I should have made this run or that run.\" And do they see eye to eye? He laughs. \"I don't usually tell her if I disagree.\" It is his father, though, with whom he shares perhaps the strongest bond. Arnar Gudjohnsen was a successful footballer before him, one of the best players in the Belgian league in the late 1980s. He, too, was an Iceland international and in one memorable game son came on as substitute for father. \"I've always thought my dad was a fantastic footballer, the best I've ever seen. He's helped me a lot. He's a great father, a great friend and he's now also my agent.\" The Icelandic people seem to regard Gudjohnsen junior as a hero. Even when it emerged that he had spent more than \u00a3400,000 playing blackjack and roulette in London's casinos during a five-month period, they stood by him. \"There were stories flying about that I had nothing left, that I was basically living on the street! Luckily I have never felt any animosity or negativity from the people [in Iceland], they are always amazing to me and that makes me feel very proud.\" </p> <p>Gudjohnsen will eventually return to Iceland. His roots are important to him and he has made sure that his two children are fluent in both English and Icelandic. \"We have traditional Icelandic meals at Christmas. If we have people visiting they'll bring something typically Icelandic, such as harfiskur . It's just dried fish that you eat with a bit of butter, it's amazing. It's a terrible smell, though.\" </p> <p>With that, Gudjohnsen suppresses a yawn. His team-mates are wandering back and forth in their Chelsea regulation flip-flops and with an embarrassed smile he leans in for confession: \"I'm usually sleeping by now.\" The new Chelsea season promises to be a wide-eyed rollercoaster ride of action.

Just as on that historic Sixties night, Shelbourne have injected some badly needed pride into senior soccer on this island. </p> <p>At the very least the Shels' magnificent draw with the Spanish giants demonstrates that there is still a skill base, collective belief and even life itself left among local football sides crippled by debt and overshadowed by the obscenely overpaid super-clubs of the English Premiership and the Scottish Old Firm. Yet the achievements of the North Dublin reds alongside the recent UEFA cup exploits of the pride of East Belfast should also provide an opportunity to debate maturely one of the central structural problems that beset Irish soccer on both sides of the border: the existence of two separate football league championships. </p> <p>Think about the absurdity of having two distinct championships on one small island. Tolka Park and The Oval are a two-hour coach journey apart but there is a greater likelihood of Shelbourne playing in Galicia than the east end of Belfast. Ditto for Glentoran. Can you think of another part of the EU, with the exception of Cyprus, where there are two different leagues catering for a relatively small fan base? </p> <p>The Irish League and the Eircom League are products of partition and thus prisoners of our troubled history. But why should sportsmen and women who have been among the pillars of decent civic society during three decades of incipient civil war be imprisoned by the past? There ought to be no political agenda or hidden conspiracy in any future all-Ireland soccer league championship: after all, there is and have been warm relations and close co-operation between football clubs on both sides of the border. The Dunfield experience has been an example of cross-border co-operation before cross-border co-operation became fashionable post-Good Friday 1998. </p> <p>The collaboration between Dundalk and Linfield (Dunfield being the synthesis of the two sides' nomenclatures) in promoting cross-community, trans-frontier projects, especially those involving children, is proof that sides from both leagues can work together for the common good. Moreover, there has been a steady cross-border flow of talent between clubs in the south and the north. Shelbourne manager Pat Fenlon is an example of this having played for several seasons at Windsor Park. </p> <p>Aside from the political and security objections to any all-Ireland set-up there are also practical and financial challenges. The travels costs for smaller clubs such as Distillery or Crusaders playing Cork or Waterford could put them in serious economic difficulties. The way around this is to break the league into three components: a 10-strong Premiership consisting of the top five from the Eircom and the Irish leagues; a southern promotion league and a northern counterpart, each putting one team respectively into the top flight at the end of every season. </p> <p>In its early stages, therefore, the Irish Premiership will be comprised of the likes of Linfield and Glentoran in the north playing the bigger Dublin clubs such as Shelbourne and Bohemians. The capacity for these clashes raising gate receipts alongside an all-island television deal could in turn generate more sponsorship and cash for the entire all-Ireland soccer enterprise thus supporting the poorer clubs north and south. </p> <p>One of the strongest deterrents for supporters turning up to Irish soccer matches is the allure of an English and Scottish Premiership side. Every weekend in the season the airports of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are filled with thousands of passengers waiting for flights to Liverpool, Glasgow, Manchester, Stansted and Gatwick. Given the increasingly availability of cheap flights from Northern Ireland and the Republic to Britain, the fan-drain from this island every Saturday is bound to accelerate. For that reason alone, a future all-Ireland league should follow the example of Eircom, which runs its league in the months largely outside the English and Scottish Premiership seasons. </p> <p>The British government is about to spend millions regenerating local football in Northern Ireland, but without insisting the game moves into some kind of an all-island context there is little prospect of the sport attracting the extra thousands of fans needed for survival. Surely there must be some forward thinkers who are prepared to think the unthinkable and radically alter the structure of Irish club soccer after more than 80 years of division and decline. If there are, then they may find new financial donors from beyond these islands in the direction of Europe. </p> <p>Because an all-Ireland league founded for sporting reasons would be an ideal candidate for millions of euros from the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund. The fund has already spent millions on the people who actually wreaked havoc and division on this island for 35 years, so it must be time to lavish their cash on a project that will do the opposite. </p> <p> <a href=\"MAILTO:henry.mccdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mccdonald@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>There were echoes of Maradona and the World Cup of 1986 as Sir Bobby Robson examined the stoppage-time goal that deprived his Newcastle team of victory. 'The Hand of Hasselbaink,' said Robson, the manager who suffered from the Hand of God goal punched past Peter Shilton in Mexico. </p> <p>Hasselbaink's goal, guided in from Bolo Zenden's cross was less blatant and many in the crowd failed to spot it, as did the officials. But Robson's players were in no doubt what happened. </p> <p>Robson said: 'I didn't see it straight away, but Shola Ameobi was next to him and he was furious. He said it was clearly handball. </p> <p>'The linesman let us down. The referee couldn't see it, but I think the linesman could. It is disappointing to concede a goal like that so late in the game. He handled it. He didn't head it and don't let anybody tell you different.' </p> <p>Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren was, predictably, one person who did have a different outlook. 'It went in the back of the net, the referee gave it and we drew 2-2. End of story,' he said. So another season starts with yet another controversy, albeit one that ensured the correct outcome to a competitive derby in which Robson's decision to omit Kieron Dyer from his starting line-up was a major talking point. </p> <p>The decision followed reports that Dyer and Robson had an argument on the training ground in Friday over his right-wing role in the side, a version of events denied by the manager last night. </p> <p>'I had a long discussion with Kieron about his injuries and what we should do,' said Robson. 'Nicky Butt and Jermaine Jenas were in a fitter condition than Kieron so I left him out. </p> <p>'If people are saying he's not happy with my selection, I say utter rubbish. I don't know where these stories come from. If Kieron is unhappy he should tell me and I will tell him to go and sit on a telegraph wire.' </p> <p>Add the virus that has seriously affected Newcastle's training and deprived them of several players here and a point would probably have been the height of their ambitions before this match. </p> <p>Middlesbrough, largely untroubled by similar problems during most of their their build-up, were disrupted by late injuries to Gareth Southgate and Franck Queudrue, leaving both defences deprived of significant figures. </p> <p>The makeshift nature of both back fours was easy to detect, particularly during a first half that started so promisingly for Middlesbrough, who were without the suspended Mark Viduka yet could not find a place in their 16 for Juninho. </p> <p>Yet chances were infrequent until the closing stages and the only clear-cut one of the opening half was accepted calmly by Craig Bellamy. Aaron Hughes won the ball near the halfway line and played it into space for Bellamy, who raced clear and did well to round Mark Schwarzer before scoring. </p> <p>Bellamy continued to be the chief threat after the break, hooking over in the 53rd minute and almost embarrassing Ugo Ehiogu and Mark Schwarzer when he nipped between them 14 minutes later before poking his shot wide. </p> <p>The emergence of the Middlesbrough substitute Stewart Downing transformed the match. He forced a fine save from Shay Given before steering in Hasselbaink's cross in the 73rd minute. </p> <p>Another replacement, Newcastle's Shola Ameobi, was brought down by Zenden to give Alan Shearer his 390th goal for the club in his 500th appearance as he powered in a penalty. </p> <p>Jenas should have made the game safe for Newcastle seconds before the controversial equaliser that so deflated Robson, whose side made a habit of conceding late goals last season. 'I'm very upset,' he said. 'We played very well, fought hard and looked a good side. </p> <p>'But there were times last season when we lost games right at the end and it happened again today. I can't be disappointed with this team, though. We had a makeshift back four and coped very well.' </p> <p>McClaren said: 'I thought we did enough to earn a point, but I feared it wasn't going to be our day after going behind twice </p> <p>'We have to be pleased with a point. We were missing the quality of Franck Queudrue, Gareth Southgate and Mark Viduka so it was always going to be difficult.' </p> <p> <strong> Man of the Match</strong> </p> <p><strong> Craig Bellamy</strong> The arrival of Patrick Kluivert, coupled with the continued effectiveness of Alan Shearer, might have been expected to have increased the pressure on Bellamy. But the Wales striker sent his own message here with an excellent display. His well taken first-half goal typified his contribution to a full-blooded derby. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The IRA leadership has held a top-level conference to quell internal dissent over Gerry Adams's remarks that the terrorist group may disband. <p>Senior IRA figures - including key Adams allies such as Bobby Storey and Sean 'Spike' Murray - met members of its South Armagh brigade in the border region 10 days ago. </p> <p>The meeting took place just over the frontier at a hotel in north Louth. It was convened in response to Adams's statement that the IRA needed to disband to prevent Unionists exploiting its existence as an excuse to avoid sharing power with republicans. </p> <p>The Sinn Fein president's comments during the West Belfast Festival were said to have sent shockwaves through the republican movement particularly in south Armagh. Adams said he envisaged the IRA going out of business as part of a 'process of sustainable change'. This was the first time he had baldly stated that the IRA disappear in order to boost the peace process. </p> <p>Whenever dissent is raised over the republican leadership's political initiatives Storey and his comrades are dispatched to potentially recalcitrant units to win them over. During the build up to the IRA ceasefire 10 years ago Storey played a leading role in persuading Provo units to back the military cessation. </p> <p>Among the Belfast IRA delegation at the meeting was Brendan 'Bik' McFarlane who was convicted in 1975 for a bomb and gun attack on the Bayardo Bar on Belfast's Shankill Road. McFarlane is one of Adams's most trusted supporters. </p> <p>Suspecting they were under security force surveillance, the leading Provos answered questions by passing written notes between them and their south Armagh colleagues. </p> <p>A senior Garda source said the Belfast IRA men were subjected to vigorous questioning by their south Armagh comrades. He added that the meeting broke up amicably without any indication of a split emerging. </p> <p>Significantly, the leading figure in the IRA's south Armagh brigade Thomas 'Slab' Murphy was not present at the meeting which took place in the hotel prior to lunch time. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a serious schism has emerged inside Sinn Fein in Antrim Town. An entire branch of the party has resigned in protest over a row on the Rathenraw estate in recent weeks. The argument with the Sinn Fein leadership in Belfast began following disagreements over what to do about a woman on the estate whose partner was arrested with half a million pounds' worth of ecstasy tablets. Locals backed by Antrim Sinn Fein representatives asked the woman to leave the Rathenraw but the republican leadership in Belfast ordered the local party branch to back her right to stay. Apart from resignations including a number of election candidates there have been allegations that a Belfast Sinn Fein member issued death threats to his former comrades on the Antrim estate.</p>",
  "<p>For all the imagery of cloud-shrouded mountains, rocky gorges and graceful rivers, China has never paid much attention to preserving its environment. Taoists advocated going with the natural flow but, from the early emperors to Mao, the emphasis was on mastering nature - both from necessity and as a symbol of man's superiority. </p> <p>Now the battle between the world's most populous nation and its environment has reached an unprecedented pitch, posing fundamental questions for the leadership in Beijing. </p> <p>Experts calculate the price of the damage China's environment is suffering at from 5 to 12 per cent of GDP - the flip side of its emergence as a world economic power. On one side lies the bounding growth - official figures show a 9.7 per cent rise in the first half of 2004 - on the other is a looming major disaster. </p> <p>There are still vast swathes of untouched countryside; huge areas in the south-west and many mountain ranges. But, for many of China's 1.3 billion people, the cost of growth is already all too evident. Rivers are full of industrial and human waste. Forests essential to the eco-system have been felled for timber, grasslands are being ploughed up. Desertification is spreading through northern provinces. Sandstorms blow through Beijing. Demand from factories and urban housing developments accentuate long-standing water distribution problems. Big rivers have had dry spells, while the building of the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtzi has created a huge lake in which parasitic worms dangerous to humans are endemic. </p> <p>In a survey of China's environment challenge, Dr Elizabeth Economy of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York reports that 60 million people have limited access to water; 10 times as many drink contaminated water. </p> <p>The movements of tens of millions from the countryside in search of work in rapidly expanding cities puts a major strain on urban infrastructure while the explosive growth in the use of cars and trucks adds to air pollution. </p> <p>Forty per cent of the rural population lack sanitation and the dangers of epidemics were shown dramatically by the spread of Sars. </p> <p>The government has launched plans to try to turn back the degradation and pursue sustainable development. But too often the effects have been limited. Officials report a successful outcome when investigation shows major difficulties remain. </p> <p>In encouraging the move from Maoism to the market, the patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, devolved the job to local officials who frequently have investments in factories, giving them a vested interest in not applying too strictly regulations that could reduce output. Equally, it is easy for them to tip off factory managers an inspection is due. </p> <p>China produces an estimated 60 billion tonnes of polluted water a year. The saga of the Huai river, as recounted by Economy, is an example of how things go wrong. The size of England, the fertile Huai valley is home to 150 million people. Under Mao, 200 dams were built to stop flooding - 200,000 people drowned when two collapsed in 1973. After Deng changed China's course at the end of the 1970s, tens of thousands of factories set up along the river and its tributaries. In 1994, some tanks were emptied into the river, flooding it with toxins, turning the water black, killing 26 million lbs of fish and making thousands of people ill. Five thousand factories were shut down; half subsequently re-opened. </p> <p>'Towns and villages continue to build small paper mills, dye works, tanneries and chemical works with crude equipment,' a local environmental officer reported. A clean-up campaign began in 1998. As it got going, waste again turned the water black. In 1999 and 2000, the Huai ran dry for the first time in 20 years. In 2001, the State Environmental Protection Administration declared the water good enough for drinking. A local expert found it was not even suitable for irrigation. Only six of 52 planned treatment plants had been built. </p> <p>Torrential rains that summer sent 38 billion gallons of water flooding over locks, covered with yellow foam, garbage and industrial waste. Another campaign was ordered, but in 2003 the water was still unsuitable for drinking, fishing or even, in some cases, industrial use. The clean-up cost is now put at $100bn. </p> <p>In the south, roads in booming Guangdong province are lined with mounds of industrial garbage and stagnant pools. The water by one site used to strip and burn circuit boards contains lead levels reported to be 2,400 times higher than World Health Organisation drinking guidelines. In Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, the water has to be so heavily chlorinated that the local beer is virtually undrinkable. </p> <p>From the summit of Shanghai's tallest building, the city 100 floors below can barely be seen through the haze. In Hong Kong, air pollution is boosted by the industrial zones across the border. </p> <p>Nowhere is the problem worse than in the energy industry that struggles to keep up with insatiable demand. Coal-fired stations provide 75 per cent of China's electricity. Cheaper to build than nuclear plants (and China has plenty of coal), as well as smoke, they emit dioxins and other pollutants that cause acid rain and breathing disorders estimated to kill 400,000 people a year. </p> <p>After half a dozen Chinese cities were ranked among the 10 most polluted on Earth in the late 1990s, the government launched a clean-up campaign. From 2000 to 2002, levels dropped, but 2003 showed a 12 per cent increase. </p> <p>The prime reason is the sheer scope of development and things are made worse by spotty enforcement of pollution controls; it is often cheaper to pay pollution levies than to refit plants with cleaning equipment. Even more coal is likely to be used after recurrent energy blackouts, including a 30,000-megawatt shortfall, the worst for two decades. Adding to that are the hundreds of millions of homes using coal. </p> <p>China's neighbours are suffering. In South Korea, estimates put the share of air pollution originating in China at up to 40 per cent. There is also speculation that the effects may be felt in America - sand from the desertification of northern China is known to have crossed the Pacific. China is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, though, in its present state of development, is not bound by it. </p> <p>Its leaders claim a dedication to environmental improvements, yet action has been, at best, halting. Optimists hope that, as the country gets richer, it will give more power to environmental agencies. The present situation, they argue, is the natural outcome of its fast-track development. Pressure from abroad will also come as Beijing integrates more closely into global markets. </p> <p>For a country so focused on material progress, ecological degradation takes second place. The regime's calculation that growth is the route to legitimacy gives economic factors great political weight. Some figures in the hierarchy of the world's last major Communist nation appreciate the need for environmental reform. The irony is that, for all the monopoly power of the Party, change is becoming increasingly difficult, with terrible effects for the country itself, and a growing threat to others as well. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Jonathan Fenby is a former editor of the 'South China Morning Post' in Hong Kong and author of 'Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the China he Lost' (Free Press-Simon &amp; Schuster)</p>",
  "Libyan secret agents in London gave around \u00a3185,000 to an Islamic activist linked by American prosecutors to al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations, court documents obtained by The Observer reveal. <p>US officials suspect the $340,000 given to Abdurahman Amoudi, an Eritrean-born American who is a leading Muslim activist in the US, was destined to help militant volunteers travel to Iraq to fight US and British forces. Amoudi says the cash was for peaceful campaigning. </p> <p>The disclosure of the gift, made last August, will embarrass Britain since the Foreign Office was then involved in negotiations with the regime of Colonel Muammar Gadaffi. </p> <p>'It's hardly ideal. You don't really want your partner in peace handing out large sums of cash to dodgy characters in hotel rooms in your capital city while you discuss everlasting friendship,' said one former government foreign relations adviser. </p> <p>The talks, presented as a major diplomatic coup for Tony Blair, resulted in Libya renouncing terrorism and its weapons of mass destruction, accepting responsibility for downing a jet airliner over Lockerbie and being partially readmitted to the international community. United Nations sanctions against Libya were lifted on 9 September last year - just three weeks after the London incident. US sanctions remain. </p> <p>A transcript of his interviews with the Metropolitan Police Special Branch says Amoudi, 52, got the cash in a 'Samsonite-style briefcase' by an unknown man 'speaking Arabic with a Libyan accent' who visited his room at Hotel Metropole in London's Edgware Road on 13 August last year. </p> <p>He said he had received smaller gifts from Libya in the preceding years after establishing a relationship with senior figures in the Tripoli regime in the Nineties. </p> <p>Amoudi, who runs several major Muslim community groups in America, tried to leave the UK for Syria immediately after receiving the cash. He was stopped by customs officers at Heathrow airport who found the money in 34 bundles in his baggage. It is believed MI5 watched him throughout his visit here. </p> <p>The purpose of Gadaffi's gift is unclear. The maverick leader used to sponsor terrorist groups, including the Iran-backed Hizbollah, which is based in Syria, groups in south-east Asia and the IRA. </p> <p>However the Libyan leader has cracked down on Islamic groups in his own country, and recently supplied Western intelligence services with details of militants' operations in Africa. He wants a reconciliation with the US. </p> <p>However relations will have been damaged by a court case in the US. Amoudi is awaiting sentence after being convicted in eastern Virginia of money-laundering and immigration offences. </p> <p>American investigators told the US court that 'money travelling to Syria is of concern because foreign fighters are paid in Syria [as they travel] into Iraq'. </p> <p>They noted that two men convicted of trying to 'fight alongside al-Qaeda against US troops in Afghanistan received money from one of Amoudi's organisations [in America] before they left'. </p> <p>It was possible the sum seized at Heathrow was 'to fund terrorism by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and/or similar groups', the investigators said. Prosecutor Paul McNulty called Amoudi a 'major player in the financial support of terrorism'. </p> <p>Libya has denied the accusations. No one at its London embassy was available for comment. The same was true at the Foreign Office.</p>",
  "<p>The five cities competing to host the 2012 Olympics are all convinced that hosting the games offers prestige and prosperity like nothing else on earth. Yet without careful planning, the Olympic dream can turn distinctly sour. </p> <p>Ask the inhabitants of Mexico City. Their strongest memory of 1968 is not Bob Beamon's long jump, but the government's bloody suppression of pre-games riots; 267 people were killed. </p> <p>Or the smokers of Montreal. A sixth of every cent they spend on their habit goes towards the 30-year-old debt from the 1976 games, which ended up costing four times the original estimate. By 2006 the main stadium - 'The Big Owe' - will have cost the taxpayer US$2.4 billion (\u00a31.3bn). </p> <p>Since Los Angeles in 1984 (the first profitable games since 1932), revenues from the Olympics have soared. TV rights, for example, shot up from $32 million in Montreal to $287m in LA and $1.3bn in Sydney. But so have infrastructure costs. Barcelona spent almost $10bn, as part of a massive regeneration effort. Given Britain's track record on such projects (the Channel tunnel's budget ballooned from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a34.7bn, Wembley stadium's from \u00a3475m to \u00a3757m) London 2012 would need to watch its purse strings. </p> <p>For pure profit, the two recent American games (LA and Atlanta in 1996) are the model to follow. Hefty corporate support, low spending, solid profits. But Atlanta's dash-for-cash approach is now pass\u00e9, after a generally disappointing event. 'Gigantism' is also on the way out, as the tens of billions Beijing is spending has prompted a reaction - spearheaded by new IOC head Jacques Rogge - in favour of 'compact' Olympics, leaving genuinely useful facilities and urban regeneration rather than white-elephant stadium complexes.</p> <p>What's fashionable in Olympic bids now, therefore, is between the extremes - profits without being overly commercial, championing regeneration without incurring crippling debt. The London 2012 bid fits into this category, abetted by the government's reluctance to spend heavily. It follows the Seoul/Sydney approach - regeneration and investment, but a firm eye on the bottom line. The organisers are being offered up to \u00a32.3bn of public money (\u00a3750m from the lottery) in addition to sponsorship and broadcast revenue which they hope will mean profits. </p> <p>More important than the games's operating profits is their longer-term economic effects. The worry is that in a thriving city such as London, there would be no 'Barcelona bounce' - tourist numbers would recede, leaving only memories and empty arenas.</p> <p>But Tony Travers of the LSE is optimistic: 'Britain - not just London - finds it enormously difficult to deliver large regeneration projects. The great advantage the Olympics would offer is the need to deliver within an internationally accepted deadline.'</p> <p>By channelling the legacy into deprived areas of east London, a British games could combine commercial and social success in truly Olympian style.</p> <p><strong>Cities of gold?

  "<p><strong>In Praise of Women</strong> The Gallery, Oxo Tower Wharf, London SE1, until 22 Aug</p> <p>Zimbabwe means 'house of stone', and visiting In Praise of Women, a stunning exhibition of sculpture by Zimbabwean women, there is a sense of having walked inside that house.

Their collective presence is overwhelming, silently assertive; the stone speaks. </p> <p>Not that they are without wit. I loved Marian Nyanhongo's Photo Pose, a woman with a sublime pout and swerve of the head. Was she trying to avoid the camera?

  "American Indians have been massacred, moved and marginalised for centuries.

An Indian elder waved a fan of feathers over Kerry's head as he sat with his wife, Teresa, in front of about 4,000 Indians. </p> <p>The ceremony, which was closed to photographers because of its sacred place in Indian religious beliefs, came at the end of an extensive tour of reservations by the Democrat contender. Kerry made a pitch for their votes by speaking out against the poverty on most reservations. 'There's a feeling that the people here haven't been respected,' he said in Gallup. </p> <p>The Democrats are producing campaign literature in tribal languages. Members of the Tohono O'odham tribe sang the national anthem at the Democrats' national convention. </p> <p>Arizona's Democrat governor, Janet Napolitano, held a special party there for native American tribes, reflecting her belief that their votes were crucial in her own 2002 election victory in the state. </p> <p>In Arizona, more than 300,000 native Americans make up almost 6 per cent of the population. In New Mexico, the figure is 10 per cent - and in 2000 Bush lost the state by just 366 votes. Wisconsin, Washington, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota also have large Indian populations - Wisconsin was won by Al Gore in 2000 by less than 1 per cent. </p> <p>The Republican party has also launched an initiative to win over the usually sceptical native American voters. Most usually vote Democrat, but a growing number are Republican sympathisers, said a spokesman for the National Congress of American Indians. 'It really is changing rapidly. There is a rising Republican constituency.' </p> <p>Republican campaigners have produced radio adverts in the Navajo language for the first time . In Arizona, various tribes recently helped Republicans to win local elections. Health Secretary Tommy Thompson visited the same Navajo reservation as Kerry last July as part of a drive against the alcoholism and diabetes which plague its resi dents. Experts believe these visits are vital. 'Marginalised groups respond very well. Don't underestimate the \"He came to my store\" or \"He came to my living room\" factor,' said Zogby. </p> <p>But besides the need to get out every vote in the swing states, another factor is at play: money. Some tribes have benefited hugely from cash from casinos built on their land. The flood of money from gambling has made some of them power players in elections, where cash is often the key to success. In last year's California governorship poll, Indian tribes donated $11 million (\u00a36m) of the $65m spent by the candidates. </p> <p>Some of the biggest Indian political donors give cash to Republican causes, but Zogby said: 'They are major financial players for Republicans in several states, but the native Americans' votes still generally go to the Democrats.'</p>",
  "<p>Sky-high oil prices are threatening to send the global economy into a spin, but to what extent are the big oil multinationals to blame for the crisis? Much has been made about disruption to supplies from Iraq, booming demand from China and the fact that world's appetite for oil is close to outstripping what the producing nations can produce. </p> <p>The top 10 independent oil companies account for 20 per cent of global production, and they are raking in cash from the high oil price, and giving it back to shareholders through share buybacks and chunky dividends. </p> <p>Jon Rigby, oil analyst at Commerzbank, says this is because capital expenditure 'is not being flexed. That is why cash is coming back to shareholders.' But he also suggests that such spending has not been 'flexed' throughout the current oil price cycle, which saw prices averaging a rock bottom $12.72 in London and $14.39 in New York in 1998. </p> <p>So are the companies partly to blame for the current surge, which could see prices nearly treble the 1998 average this year, because they failed to develop new supplies quickly enough? </p> <p>Clearly, expecting them to balance world demand is unrealistic - they do not operate as a cartel, restricting supply to manipulate price, in the way Opec does: they sell all their output. Yet could they have invested earlier to ensure that greater capacity was available now? </p> <p>Rigby says: 'When the price was low, they were probably underinvesting.' </p> <p>Indeed, the raw figures for the for the top 10 companies compiled by oil industry consultant Wood Mackenzie show a drop from $45.9 billion in 1998 to $36bn in 1999. The total did not return to 1998 levels until 2001, before accelerating last year to $57.6bn. </p> <p>However, Derek Butter of Wood Mackenzie says: 'Companies are now spending at record levels. The reasons for the high price are not simply on the supply side; it is also a consequence of surging demand, coupled with supply disruptions, particularly in Iraq and Nigeria, due to civil unrest.' </p> <p>The firms themselves emphasise that capital spending is dictated by long-term considerations, not price volatility. </p> <p>But most have recently revised upwards their expectations of the long- term oil price, while City analysts say the size of their investment is inevitably affected by cash generation and the market price. </p> <p>Rigby says: 'Capital expenditure is not going up in cyclical terms. There is a view in the market now that the level of capacity comfort above demand is due to the low spending by both nationalised oil companies (such as Saudi Aramco) and independent companies.' </p> <p>Adjusting the raw spending figures by linking them to production gives a clearer idea of the trend throughout the cycle, as firms pump oil more when the price is higher. So in 1998, the ratio of expenditure to production was 3.4 times. It fell to 2.6 the following year, and did not reach 1998 levels again until 2003.' </p> <p>Rigby says: 'You find that the oil companies reacted very quickly on the downside, and have been much slower to come back up to mid-cycle levels.' </p> <p>Butter has a caveat: while there is a link between spending and production, it is a lagging one, and the production figures from the top 10 companies have been boosted by mergers and takeovers. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the trend may be prudent. BP for example, spent freely in the Eighties on exploration and production, as did Shell in the Nineties, but with unhappy returns. And in the short term this may have contributed to today's cash bonanza and the highlighting of oil companies as top picks by equity market strategists. </p> <p>However, in the longer term, compa nies maintain their value by finding more oil to pump (major finds have declined and replacement of reserves has been slipping), while energy consumers hope they will keep finding it to keep prices down.' </p> <p>Different companies have different records. Those of the UK giants, BP and Shell, are mixed. BP's performance is obscured by the huge mergers with Amoco and Arco of the US that transformed its scale. Shell had a major overhaul in 1998, partly spurred by the lower oil price, that saw it impose harsh capital discipline. One analyst says: 'At Shell this definitely resulted in underspend.' </p> <p>Consolidation, such as BP's US tie-ups, Exxon link with Mobil, Chevron's with Texaco, and the combining of Total, Fina and Elf, have also marginally affected total capital spending, as budgets have been trimmed as part of the merger process. </p> <p>But exploration budgets, rather than those for developing discoveries, have been hit hardest. Total exploration spending for the 10 in 1998 was $11.3bn. Last year it was $8bn. </p> <p>The companies point to a number of reasons for this. BP, for example says that following poor performance in the Eighties chasing small finds in the North Sea, chief executive Lord Browne focused on large 'elephant' finds where costs were lower. The problem has been the decline of such finds. One company official says: 'Accessing reserves gets more difficult, simply because there is not the number of big fields.' </p> <p>Butter adds: 'New field exploration results in the past few years have not been particularly good. There has not been the opening of major new provinces which we saw in the mid-Nineties when the independents's exploration success in deep water Angola and Nigeria was bolstered by a resurgence of exploration success in the US Gulf of Mexico and access to explore in Kazakhstan.' </p> <p>Under these circumstances the majors believe cash is better returned to shareholders. </p> <p>Meanwhile, development spending has shot up from $34.6bn to $49.5, as companies have raced to get finds in areas that were open to exploration in the Nineties ready to operate. </p> <p>Butter expects development spending in these areas to go on rising in the next two years, driving production growth of between 2 and 3 per cent until 2008. </p> <p>But in the longer term, the increased production in these areas is likely only to balance out declines in others - particularly in the North Sea, where it peaked five years ago, and in the 'lower 48' US states, he says. </p> <p>One area of growth would be in areas now operated by nationalised oil companies, often in Opec countries. Indeed, Opec, particularly the Middle East where costs are relatively low, is expected to be the main source of new future supply. Oil companies covet access to these areas. If they get it, investment may rise. If not, the faltering investment, particularly in exploration, that has emerged since 1998 may become permanent.</p>",
  "<p>Is House of Fraser a target or a predator? Two years ago Tom 'Richest man in Scotland' Hunter wanted House of Fraser, with a view to an alliance with Allders. Two struggling department store groups with, as he saw it, a brighter future together. Then Minerva and Terry Green acquired Allders and Green's pal, John Coleman, lived to fight another day. </p> <p>Now House of Fraser has a different feel. There are analysts who share the management's view that this business is just too pricey to be a bargain. </p> <p>Coleman's team set out their stall around improving poor margins and systems and sorting out the Mohamed al-Fayed debt hangover. They have put three percentage points on to the margins; sales and profits are growing at the same rate as Next's and the expansion programme is solid. </p> <p>In terms of future revenue, the House of Fraser Storecard is interesting. The last time we spoke to HoF, it refused to comment on the deal with GE Capital, largely because the terms are awful. Since then the storecard landscape has opened up as a result of consumer pressure and a Competition Commission inquiry. </p> <p>GE Capital now has serious competition from high-street banks - good for House of Fraser, currently negotiating a renewal on different terms or with the right to take back its business in 2007 with two years' notice. If the management cannot improve the terms - they receive no cut of the profits - in the current climate, they ought to resign in shame. </p> <p>We understand that the HoF card business is expanding. Newly trained staff are selling to a finance-savvy customer (in the ABC1 group) at ease with debt. </p> <p>Add to this the changing face of the retail competition. Selfridges has gone private and its new owner, Galen Weston, has axed the expansion plan that was Vittorio Radice's big idea. More than Debenhams, Selfridges was building up to be quite a threat. So sighs of relief at HoF, where few dispute that the arrival and upgrades of Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and John Lewis in its key territories, Manchester and Birmingham, has hit the tills. </p> <p>On the downside, debt remains beefy. There is always a gap between promises and reality (though it is understood that trade is respectable, with summer sales moderate and most stores 'clean' and ready for autumn stock). Rentals are another issue, having rocketed due to leases expiring. One central London store's rent has risen eighteenfold. The company has treated this as an excep tional, but the money has to come from somewhere. </p> <p>Investors hope HoF will increase dividends as the financial baggage is cleared. It is still in the market for acquisitions, though it would be unlikely to grab at Allders, say, unless the price plummeted, because it would not want many of the sites. An alternative scenario is that Hunter, HoF's major shareholder, or Icelandic group Baugur, will decide they want to wrest control. Either way, House of Fraser is not a bad bet.</p> <p><strong> Billiton booms beyond China</strong></p> <p> While its former chief executive, Brian Gilbertson, heads for Russia with a reputed $50 million pay deal, mining and resources group BHP Billiton will give the City details of its own windfall. </p> <p>Formed by Gilbertson through merging BHP and Billiton in 2001, the group has responded to surging demand for commodities in China with production surges of its own across most of its products. Iron ore, copper, aluminium and diamond production have shown growth of at least 20 per cent over 2002 levels and analysts are expecting a 70 per cent hike in next week's year-end profits. </p> <p>But with growth in China expected to slow in the second half of the year, will the Anglo-Australian group continue to strike it big? The consensus is that it will. Mining watchers believe BHP will continue to run flat out, with demand for iron ore and coking coal likely to remain strong. Predictions are for volume increases into next year, along with strong prices. </p> <p>Most argue that mining stocks have fallen because of concerns that Chinese growth would falter. But although the need for commodities in the People's Republic may moderate, it will do so from such high levels that prices are likely to be supported for some time. As mining executives and sector analysts agree, if Chinese demand was not slowing, prices would be even higher. </p> <p>What distinguishes BHP from the rest of the sector is its oil exploration and production business, which contributed about 25 per cent of earnings at the half year. Output was disappointing, falling 15 per cent in June. However, the longer-term outlook is different. There was strong exploration data in the last quarter and three new projects received approval for development. </p> <p>Analysts believe that BHP has a strong spread of assets, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, and that there are prospects for growth over the next decade. Meanwhile, as spot prices continued to break records last week, oil futures markets pointed to crude prices staying on average over $30 a barrel for at least the next 10 years. </p> <p>BHP Billiton has had three years of profits growth. With commodity markets in general and crude oil in particular looking unlikely to fall back in the short term, there will probably be more to come.</p>",
  "<p>During my first therapy session at the start of my training with RD Laing, I found myself explaining that I couldn't cry. I'd learnt to suppress my tears the day I started boarding school as an eight-year-old - grief-stricken at leaving the family, wanting to weep my guts out, yet instinctively needing to occlude my vulnerability. Most of the other kids appeared similarly choked; a few muffled sobs into pillows could be heard that night in the dormitory, but none of them mine. Inhibiting and distorting the flow of natural energy within - I didn't have words for it then, I could just feel it viscerally - seemed the only expedient. </p> <p>Strangely, I subsequently found a facility for occasionally disclosing my feelings without shame in conversation with the others - I wasn't embarrassed to say I was scared or homesick, which I'm sure saved me from becoming totally emotionally dysfunctional in later life - but refused to display my raw inner truth by going anywhere near the crying zone. Composure was all. I can feel my throat muscles tightening just writing about it. </p> <p>Lots of water under the bridge later, having trained as a therapist, then doctor of Oriental medicine, having lived with Native Americans in New Mexico studying shamanism, then practising as a healer for some years, hence relatively self-aware, I still hadn't cried. Then RD Laing, mentor and father figure, died and I cried for three whole days and nights: he had bequeathed me the gift of my own tears. </p> <p>Crying, like laughter, is a natural semi-autonomic function, there simply to force your diaphragm, the muscle that works your lungs, to let go, so you breathe out and thus release whichever intense emotion you were holding onto in your chest and abdomen. But it makes mascara run, figuratively speaking, and hence it is often inappropriate to indulge. </p> <p>As bottling it up is bad for you on all levels, the next best thing, the true expedient, is to consciously, purposefully exhale, from deep in your belly. Inhalation follows of itself. Exhale fully again, telling yourself you're releasing the pain, repeat until you feel your chest relax and your throat soften, then proceed as normal until you can be alone and have a good old weep.</p>",
  "<p> I used to go south for the summer: France, Spain, Italy, Greece. Heat, warm blue seas, tavernas, olive oil and red wine, abrupt sunrises and sunsets, flamboyant people. Then I met Sean, and for the first time I went north - to Sweden and, specifically, to an area in Sweden called Varmland, full of pine forests and lakes. Sean's mother is Swedish and she and her three sisters own land around one of these myriad lakes. </p> <p>Every summer, they and all the generations of their sprawling families come to spend time here, in scattered wooden houses. For the past 15 years, I have come as well. We have even built our own red-painted wooden house looking out on to the water. </p> <p>The days are long: in midsummer, there is scarcely any darkness in this part of Sweden, and even in July and August the deepest part of night is tinged with day. By four in the morning, the sun pours in through the windows; evenings stretch out, full of bats, long, soft shadows and miraculous thick light. There are hares in the meadow, swallows in the eaves, elk and deer in the forests, beavers in the lake, hawk and heron and crane over it, lynx on the prowl, wolves over the horizon, bears a bit further north, where Sweden gets really deserted and wild. Much of our time is spent foraging for food and then cooking it. I can spend hours looking for chanterelles (apricot-coloured and fluted in shape) and stout, meaty ceps, or picking wild strawberries and blueberries. The children and Sean fish for bony perch and for pike with sharp teeth. There are cloudberries on the marsh. </p> <p>After the harshness of winter (-25, dark for 20 hours, beautiful in the snow and ice, but in November or March grey, wet, and bleached of all colour), the summer here is like a green and golden rebirth which is celebrated with many rituals - the crayfish party, the mini-concerts, the BBQs, the picnic by the slippery rocks, the football matches, the night-time saunas and swims in the lake. Sometimes it rains for days and then the landscape is cool and dripping-grey and we sit by the fire and look out of the window, eat cinnamon buns, read books and squabble over card games. </p> <p>Sometimes the wind rips waves across the lake which looks murky and inhospitable; sometimes there are violent storms that turn the sky purple and frazzle computer cables and toasters. But really, every year feels much the same as the last was and the next will be (though the children grow taller and the adults grow older, hair turns grey) and this is part of the pleasure. </p> <p>I don't really like to stop writing on holiday and although I've never really been attracted to the idea of a writer's retreat (the idea of sitting in silence, attended on and waiting for ideas, strikes me as an ideal condition for a writer's block; I've always been opposed to the idea that the pram in the hall is the enemy of promise) but in a way, this place in Sweden has been my messy, child-cluttered, alcohol-fuelled, noisy and rumbustious version of a retreat. Certainly many of our novels have begun here. </p> <p>In the summer of 1995, Sean and I had just written our first Nicci French novel together, in absolute secret, in corners of the days. It felt almost illicit. We had dropped it - the way a cat drops a mouse at the feet of its appalled owner - on the doorstep of our surprised agent, and come to Varmland. We felt very far from London and the book and put it out of our mind. </p> <p>One afternoon, we were in a meadow with a group of relatives and Sean's uncle came towards us holding a mobile. It was our agent. She liked the book. Although we didn't know it at the time, it was to be the beginning of a writing partnership, and it felt - or at least, in retrospect, it feels - fitting that we had the first intimations of this when we were in Sweden together, like an echo felt from a distant world. </p> <p>Since then, we've almost always written in Sweden, or certainly had long planning discussions, while trudging through the woods with an eye open for mushrooms. The first part of our sixth book, Land of the Living,was entirely written here, in a concentrated burst. It's a discrete section of the novel, in which a young woman wakes to find herself in absolute darkness, gagged, hooded, with no memory of how she came to be there or even, at first, who she is. Bit by bit, traces of memory seeps back. To be away from England - alarm clocks, phone calls, packed lunches, violin practice, homework, housework, bed times, arrangements, everything; to be in a place where the most important decision to be made every day was what to eat in the evening - meant that we could immerse ourselves in the writing. </p> <p>I am writing this from Sweden now. We have recently finished our latest novel and are in the planning stages of the next. We have the germ of an idea. And tonight is the crayfish party. We will suck on fishy tails and drink clear liquid till our heads swim.</p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong>Nicci Gerrard has collaborated with her husband, Sean French,on six bestselling thriller before publishing Things We Knew Were True last year,her first novel under her own name.</p>",
  "<p> What I need to write well is a combination of heat, light and solitude. My first experience of southern heat and light was when I was au pair to a French family in a vineyard on the hot plain near N\u00eemes. We now spend our summers in a tiny house in the C\u00e9vennes, not far from N\u00eemes, but in very different country. There is ridge after ridge of craggy mountain hillside, all densely wooded with oaks and chestnuts up to the bare stony mountaintops, where the flocks of sheep spend the summers. </p> <p>The mountains were eaten bare by the sheep before the 18th century and the trees are the work of one imaginative man called Fabre, who replanted huge areas of mountainside. I like it here because the sheep and the uplands remind me of the Yorkshire moors, the magical landscape of my childhood holidays. But this is on a grander scale and it is mostly very hot and bright. </p> <p>Our house is on the edge of a village. We have two bedrooms and a living room - the house is the converted carriage shed of the house opposite. When we came, it was infested up to its upper balcony with a dense jungle of brambles, nightshade and bryony. It had been empty for 11 years. We cleared the land with machetes and, after much soul-searching, cut down a 100-year-old mulberry and built a pool and a terrace in front of our door. </p> <p>The terrace looks down on to our own patch of rough hillside, going down steeply to a river which moves fast and has been known to rise five metres. I sit on the terrace and write, in a kind of bowl of bright blue light, staring at the edges of the mountains, which are never the same for half an hour - sometimes vague and misty, sometimes bright green and gold trees, and at night a black silhouette against the stars, the crest of a line of conifers, the knife-edge of a ridge like a lizard's back. </p> <p>I've become a creature of routine, here in the sun. I get up early, walk to buy the bread, in the grey morning, take a walk round the hillside for an hour, climbing up under trees, passing a collection of goats and geese, saying good morning to the same six or seven people. You can think writing out on foot, the rhythm is good for thinking. Then I sit at a metal table in the weather, and write furiously - longhand - until I need to stop for lunch. I have a large number of stones and a monstrous fossil which I carry out ceremoniously to hold the papers down. </p> <p>The weather here is extreme whatever it is doing. If it is hot and still, you can see the heat shimmer. But there are sudden tempests of wind, which rattle in from nowhere, and pages fly up and over the edge of the terrace and whirl away in the river. I get more patient as I get older. Bad weather here is unworkable in. The storms bang in one's head, and all electric things - computer, telephone, television - have to be turned off. </p> <p>We had a summer hailstorm so violent once that huge pieces of ice came down an air vent and mashed up the Collected Letters of Arthur Henry Hallam which I'd borrowed from the London Library. There is nothing to do in bad weather but endure. I sit on my bed and read Terry Pratchett and watch the trees bend and hurl themselves about. </p> <p>In the afternoons, I sleep, and then I swim, and then I read, and then I walk down to the local auberge and eat dinner in a courtyard under great trees (cedars, palms, a lime.) In our early days here, we used to shop for delicious food in the local market and make meals to eat by candlelight. Now I've got it down to essentials - I've not got so long left to write books in - and I never cook. Salad and sheep's cheese and melon for lunch. Delicious mussels and omelette aux c\u00e8pes and poulet aux ecrevisses cooked by a good friend in the evening - and I can go on working over dinner. I carry a bag of books down with me and read German with a dictionary before the food arrives and then useful research books with the meal. I have my own bottle and drink a glass or two with my dinner. </p> <p>I've got the solitude right too. No house parties, no visitors. We do have another small house at the other end of the village where the family can stay and cook and play table tennis and go for walks and come up the river to swim in the pool. My main problem is people feeling sorry for me when neither my husband nor my family are here. They come in and invite me to social gatherings, and I stare wildly at them with my head full of uninterruptable strings of words I must remember, and ideas I must keep hold of, and stammer that I like being alone, I need to be alone. But they don't quite believe me. They think I must be sad when I am fiercely happier than I have ever been. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong>AS Byatt is the author of many novels.
