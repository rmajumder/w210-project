  "<p><strong> The Snow </strong><br> by Adam Roberts<br> 297pp, Gollancz, \u00a310.99</p> <p> This novel is the fifth in as many years from Adam Roberts, a young(ish) and prolific British writer. The Snow starts promisingly. In a narrative that is refreshingly direct, if free of distractions such as characters, dialogue, dramatic irony and so on, the opening pages take us at a gallop through a Wyndhamesque disaster scenario. \"The snow started falling on September 6th,\" are the first words, and the story is under way. </p> <p>We are in London, and as the insistent snow smothers the capital, the slide from normality to global disaster is sketched plausibly if synoptically: blizzards and snowploughs, side streets clogging up, people being stranded, difficulties obtaining food... but telephones and TV are still working, so life goes on. </p> <p>Gradually, though, life ceases to go on. The snowploughs grind to a halt, the drifts reach rooftop level, the phones and televisions stop working. It becomes quiet out there, with most people frozen to death and the handful of survivors staggering around using tea-trays and tennis racquets as makeshift snowshoes. Our central character, a young Asian woman named Tira, puts on her ski-jacket and snow-trousers and heads off across the roofs into Clapham, looking for other survivors. </p> <p>So far so good, but the problem with all disaster stories is that the story depends on events that have nothing to do with character development. To keep the reader involved, the author is really only left with two directions. </p> <p>The first is to go the John Wyndham route, in which survival and the re-establishment of civilised values are the main motives in a realistic-seeming set of circumstances. A recent example of this is Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow , which, for all its special effects and hints of a global catastrophe, really boils down to the story of a handful of people waiting to be rescued from a library. The other route is to use the scenario as a metaphor for something else. All the time I was reading The Snow I kept remembering Anna Kavan's 1967 novel Ice: a deep and long-lasting winter has brought social chaos, and the military intervenes to maintain order. It soon becomes clear that Kavan's book is an extended allegory about her heroin addiction.</p> <p>Roberts arrives at this choice of routes when Tira is rescued by a group of Americans who have set up a military society above the snow. This now lies three miles deep across the whole world, but Tira has managed to survive for a year underneath it. Sensing a change of direction, we wonder which way the story will go from here: Wyndham or Kavan?</p> <p>The answer is neither. Roberts closes off the realistic-seeming route by the sheer unlikeliness of his own claims. Snow three miles deep everywhere? Everywhere? That's an awful lot of snow, never mind where it came from. While Tira has been getting by on tinned food in a hole under the snow (how did she breathe?), the enterprising Americans have restored order three miles above, setting up bases and imposing the rule of law. Why neither the bases nor the rule of law sink is another evasion, but the Americans seem to have escaped from the snowy deeps with their weapons, hovercrafts, helicopters and building materials all intact. </p> <p>The author's offhand manner extends to his attempts to explain the snowfall. We first hear about a pseudoscientific electron sheath which \"crosses global lines of magnetic force\", and later there are suggestions that extraterrestrials are behind it all. You sense an authorial yawn is being barely suppressed: Roberts neither knows nor cares about the cause, so why should the reader? </p> <p>Nor is there any apparent allegorical content, other than some heavy-handed satire on repressive regimes. Tira finds herself in a society in which all documents and records are controlled. Her own story now turns out to be censored, but it's never clear why. </p> <p>From this point in the novel all the other characters are called \"[Blank]\" and their dialogue has been edited in the same way as the Watergate transcripts edited the cussing in the Oval Office. It hardly matters: much of the latter part of the novel consists of long passages of heavily padded rhetoric about side issues. </p> <p>This book shows every sign of being a hasty first draft; it does its author no credit at all and is a significant disappointment.</p>",
  "<p>When Michael Longley was offered the prestigious Queen's gold medal for poetry in 2001, he did not immediately accept. \"I'm from Northern Ireland,\" he explains. \"It can be a very complicated business. I asked if I could sleep on it and I thought about the Good Friday agreement, which I support, and the fact that two Shinners [members of Sinn Fein] were then sitting in a partitionist Stormont government. So on that basis I said yes. But thinking about it later, I think I accepted it mainly for my dad.\"</p> <p>The ghostly presence of the late Colonel Richard Longley, who served in both world wars, haunts his son's poetry, drifting through his recurring preoccupations with nature, war, love and the classical world. When Michael went to Buckingham Palace to receive his award from the Queen, he was following in his father's footsteps: Longley Sr had received the Military Cross there from King George V for single-handedly knocking out a German machine-gun post. He later won a Royal Humane Society medal for gallantry when he saved two nurses from drowning. \"I talked to the Queen about the first world war and I liked her a lot,\" Longley says. \"She is an intelligent woman and said some very humane things about the war.\"</p> <p>He had good cause to expect criticism for his decision. Twenty years previously, Seamus Heaney, Longley's contemporary and fellow Northern Irishman, had declined inclusion in an anthology of British poetry, pointing out that his \"passport's green\". While Longley, an agnostic Protestant of English parents, was not in quite the same position as the Catholic Heaney, his heritage has been an important factor in the production and perception of his work, with the editors of the influential Field Day anthology of Irish writing claiming in the early 90s that Longley had more in common with \"the semi-detached suburban muse of Philip Larkin and post-war England than with Heaney or Montague\".</p> <p>Longley is still irritated by that \"misrepresentation\" but acknowledges that his work can present challenges to both Green and Orange pieties. \"And in reality some of the time I feel British and some of the time I feel Irish,\" he says. \"But most of the time I feel neither and the marvellous thing about the Good Friday agreement was that it allowed me to feel more of each if I wanted to. When the rugby is on I don't for a moment want England to score a try, but I'm not going to deny my father and my mother and the Britannic part of my background. There is a huge amount of Anglophobia here which I've always tried to counter and correct a little.\"</p> <p>The poet Paul Muldoon worked at the BBC in Belfast when Longley was with the Arts Council there in the 70s and 80s. \"Michael is a figure who represents the future of Northern Ireland,\" says Muldoon. \"A future in which we try to make sense of each other and come to terms with each other and each other's places. There is an imaginative domain in which we can all move forward and Michael is emblematic of that.\"</p> <p>Fran Brearton of Queen's University Belfast is writing a full-length study of Longley's poetry. She says he has always resisted being interpreted in any linear tradition. \"He is obviously involved in an Irish tradition but he also builds on an English tradition. In fact he is in the tradition of dealing with tensions between traditions. He is constantly talking about Englishness and Irishness, urban and pastoral.\" Brearton says this can make him a more problematic figure to read, which partly explains why some of his contemporaries, poets such as Heaney and Derek Mahon, acquired reputations quicker. \"It was much easier to recognise Heaney as rural Irish Catholic,\" she says. \"And even someone like Mahon was more easily identifiable with his urban Belfast angst. Longley didn't fit either of those patterns and so it made it more difficult for him to find a niche.\"</p> <p>Although Longley published four collections of verse in the decade from 1969, he was generally known as the \"other\" Belfast poet. A 12-year gap until his next collection saw him slip further from public view. Peter McDonald of Christchurch College, Oxford, has written extensively on Longley. He says: \"In the critical history of Michael he has very seldom been attacked. But, particularly early on, he was read in a slightly condescending way. He was seen as a charming nature poet or a pastoral poet but somehow he wasn't a poet of the big ideas and the big issues. But in his second phase he becomes more assured and had the courage to increasingly boil the poems down till they become just a few lines or sometimes only one line, which results in an extraordinary intensity.\"</p> <p>Poet laureate Andrew Motion says: \"The first proper reading I gave was under Michael's auspices in Belfast. All these Irish poets were there who were already very well known by then and it was a wonderful and terrifying experience at the same time. When Michael came back after his silence it wasn't exactly with a roar because that denies some of the subtlety, but he was triumphant. He's one of my favourite poets and one of my favourite people.\"</p> <p>Longley's comeback collection, Gorse Fires, won the Whitbread poetry award in 1991 and his subsequent work has been accompanied by a raised public, as well as poetic, profile. In 1994 he published a poem reworking a section Homer's Iliad in the Irish Times about the reconciliation between Achilles and Priam called \"Ceasefire\". A few days later the IRA issued a statement announcing their own ceasefire. The last two lines read: \"I get down on my knees and do what must be done / And kiss Achilles' hand, the killer of my son.\"</p> <p>Throughout his career, Longley has resisted the notion of the Ulster poet as a sort of \"super-journalist\" - a phrase that usually leaves him \"embarrassed or irritated\". He argues that an artist needs time \"in which to allow the raw material of experience to settle to an imaginative depth\". But McDonald notes that in the 90s Longley did \"face up to the public world. And he did this partly through Homer and also through very private things; looking at flora and fauna in the west of Ireland, remembering his father, which began to take on resonance about contemporary Northern Ireland.\"</p> <p>Longley's latest collection, Snow Water, was published to acclaim earlier this year, with poet Anthony Thwaite talking about its \"haunting authority\". It has been shortlisted for the Forward poetry prize. Longley says he is proud of the work but notes the \"slightly alarming symmetry that I wrote four books from about 1963 to 1979 and then there was a crisis and I didn't write very much for a decade or so. I have now written four books since so I am hoping very much that the same thing doesn't happen\".</p> <p>He describes the two sets of four books as \"movements\" and says the impulse that brought about Gorse Fires has trickled on to Snow Water. \"I like to think the new book carries forward those themes of love, war, death, friendship, art. I hope by the time I die my work will look like four really long poems; a very long love poem, a very long meditation on war and death, a very long nature poem and a playful poem on the art of poetry. And like a plant, I want the strands both to entwine with each other, but every now and again to emerge as separate.\"</p> <p>Longley was born in Belfast in July 1939, half an hour before his twin brother Peter. Their parents had moved to the city from Clapham in the late 20s and between the wars his father had been a furniture salesmen. After returning from the war in 1945 he became a professional fund-raiser, first for a local hospital and then for the Northern Ireland war memorial. \"His photograph was often in the local newspapers,\" says Longley, \"and he was a minor celebrity although I didn't really appreciate that until years later.\"</p> <p>He describes his father's character as \"sedimentary\" and his mother's as \"volcanic\". His sister, Wendy, who is nine years older and lives in Toronto, was a surrogate mother to the boys. \"From an early age we all had to read my mother's mood so as not to ignite disapproval or spark off emotions we didn't understand,\" says Longley. \"I spoke recently to my sister about this and we both still see in ourselves a strong desire to please.\"</p> <p>He still lives in south Belfast, not too far from where he was brought up and went to school. His parents couldn't afford the private education they had wanted for their children and so he was sent to the local elementary school where he found himself torn between an English middle-class home life and the Belfast working-class culture of his classmates. He then went on the Royal Belfast Academical Institution where he was \"headhunted\" by a Classics master. \"We went through the Agamemnon aged 16, which was mind-bendingly difficult,\" he recalls. \"And we translated Byron and Keats into Latin and ancient Greek. That was also incredibly difficult but it has stood me in good stead since when working out syntax or finding the right word.\"</p> <p>The poet Frank Ormsby, a friend of Longley's, has taught at the school for more than 30 years. He says back issues of the school magazine are \"full of precocious poems from Derek Mahon, who was a few years behind Michael, but there is only a little prose by Longley.\" In fact, Longley was writing some poetry - \"the usual teenage angst and sexual impulses\" - but says it was forced underground by \"the pressures of examinations, sport, girls, alcohol and cigarettes. But then it resurfaced at Trinity.\"</p> <p>Longley went up to Trinity College, Dublin, to read classics in 1958. \"I feel slightly guilty in that my parents couldn't afford to send both me and my brother to university,\" he says. \"And as I was the more intellectual, but not the brighter, I went and I wasted my time there from a scholarly point of view. At 16 Peter became an apprentice engineer and he can't have had as much fun as I had.\" Peter lives in retirement in Newcastle-upon-Tyne after a career as a marine engineer.</p> <p>Longley says although his father didn't understand poetry and didn't understand the classics, \"to his credit he provided the money for me to do what I wanted to do. He died when I was 20 and half way through my course. I think both he and my mother would have expected me to get a good degree, but in fact I got a mediocre degree because I didn't work.\"</p> <p>He says he had few ambitions at university apart from writing poetry. \"Perhaps I had the vaguest notion of sleepwalking into teaching or the civil service. But I was bitten by the poetry bug. The first poetry I wrote as an undergraduate was splurges of emotion. But I remember taking one of these splurges and trying to make it into two sonnets, which took from about six in the evening until nine the following morning. That kind of challenge was addictive.\"</p> <p>Mahon followed Longley to Trinity in his second year and they began to spur each other on. The writer Iain Sinclair, who was also there at the time, has disparagingly recalled them as \"career poets\", who even then were \"in the system\". Mahon remembers Longley more as a rugby player at school, \"but I think he was also scribbling a bit in that slightly shamefaced fashion we all were. But it was in Dublin, where there was a very active scene, that we first got published. We gave each other encouragement, although it was rather abrasive encouragement.\" Together they began to read new work by Ted Hughes, Geoffrey Hill and Philip Larkin. And perhaps more importantly, Irish poets such as Louis MacNeice and Patrick Kavanagh. \"The idea that people from around here were writing poetry was hugely important,\" says Longley, who began to publish work in the undergraduate magazine and even got one poem into the Irish Times, for which he was paid \u00a35.</p> <p>The first review Longley received was in the university newspaper, by a fellow student, Edna Broderick. She had been pointed out to Longley at the entrance exam where she was tipped to win a scholarship. \"Everything she said had intelligence in it,\" he says, \"whether you were talking about coffee or the weather or anything. I showed her my first awful splutterings of poems and after two years I made a move and I took her to a little arts cinema and we saw Les Enfants du Paradis. I think Sex and the City must spoil things for young people today. In my day I thought I was going to have a heart attack just before I held hands with a girl.\" They married in 1964, with Mahon as best man, and as Edna Longley she has gone on to become one of the leading literary critics of her generation. They have three children; Rebecca, 35, a corporate headhunter, Dan, 32, a molecular biologist and Sarah, 29, an artist.</p> <p>Longley describes Edna as \"the best critic in these islands. Most of the critics that interest me have been poets, but here is someone who comes along and loves it as much as we do. She has a perfect ear and is the first person I show a poem to.\" Although she is an extraordinary in-house resource, he acknowledges her presence could be a disadvantage. \"During my crisis I wasn't completely silent, and I would show poems to Edna and she would say they didn't work. She can't dissemble and at the time that was very hurtful. So if she likes a poem I don't really give a fuck what anyone else says. My joke is that if it wasn't for her, my oeuvre would be three times the size it is now and three times as bad.\"</p> <p>Over the years the Longley home has been something of an artistic salon in Belfast and they have been active in campaigns, such as opposition to plans to scrap the classics department at Queen's. \"But we've tried to avoid an Astaire and Rogers double act,\" says Michael. \"So we seldom appear on platforms together and we have an unspoken rule that she doesn't write about me [although it is sometimes unavoidable in her studies of Northern Irish poetry] and I don't read love poems aloud if she is in the audience.\"</p> <p>After leaving university Longley briefly taught Latin in Dublin and London. When Edna was appointed to a post at Queen's they moved back to Belfast where he taught English at his old secondary school. At this time he first came into contact with Heaney, who was one of a handful of young poets clustered round the academic Philip Hobsbaum. Known as \"The Group\", these early 60s meetings under Hobsbaum's auspices have entered literary legend, but Longley says Hobsbaum never really liked his poetry and \"actually discouraged me. But I quite enjoyed the fight and it was great to meet Seamus and Marie Heaney. The whole coterie thing is very interesting in art. Moving forward with coevals and potential rivals has a key role and it's very seldom that someone flowers on their own.\"</p> <p>Mahon goes further, claiming the myth of \"The Group\", \"is a load of hooey cooked up by some journalists at the time. 'The Group' was not nearly so important as it suited certain people at the time to make out. They somehow tried to make out that Heaney, Longley and the rest of us were trying to become part of a British poetry scene when we were already part of an Irish scene. But Belfast was a fairly dismal place in those days and Hobsbaum was a nice and stimulating man, so it was somewhere to go and drink free whiskey.\"</p> <p>Longley and Mahon shared the Eric Gregory Award for young poets in 1965 and after a series of small-scale publications, Longley's first full collection, No Continuing City, which largely explored urban themes, was published in 1969. In 1970, he joined the Northern Irish Arts Council as exhibitions officer and the following year founded its literature programme and edited a journal, Causeway, which assessed the state of the arts in Ulster and, importantly, took in traditional Irish art and music.</p> <p>He says while there was an enormous amount of local artistic talent waiting to be brought to the surface, the prevailing view was still that \"culture was Beethoven and the RSC coming to Belfast once a year. My ideas have modified slightly since then and I'm less opposed to the big artistic institutions as there is more fall-out from them than I gave credit for. Perhaps I was over-devoted to the notion of the lone fiddler, but it needed someone to overstate the case back then.\"</p> <p>He oversaw literary, musical, artistic and publishing projects and, with Edna, put on poetry readings at Queen's, which attracted Robert Lowell and Hugh MacDiarmid. Longley's second collection, An Exploded View, came out in 1973 and was followed by Man Lying on a Wall in 1976, in which his attachment to the flora and fauna of County Mayo, where he often stays, was increasingly apparent. Throughout this period he and Muldoon were exchanging notes. \"The thought that there was a reader with a name attached was an incentive to write,\" says Muldoon. \"We'd often comment in great detail and there is a tradition of people being forthright in that part of the world and that is very healthy I think.\"</p> <p>While Longley was a conscientious and able administrator, he was far from desk-bound. At a time of tit-for-tat sectarian murders - as he wrote in a poem called \"Letter to Derek Mahon\", \"the stereophonic nightmare / of the Shankhill and the Falls\" - he was organising tours of Irish musicians. \"And my feeling was that you can't always preach to the converted so it was important for these musicians, and some of them are geniuses, to play in Protestant towns, although I would try to have some Protestant musicians on the bill as well.\" Astonishingly, the UDA once requested a private performance of traditional Irish music.</p> <p>In the late 80s the novelist Glenn Patterson was asked by Longley to take part in the community programme. \"There were musicians and artists as well as writers,\" he remembers. \"There was no precedent for that sort of thing at that time and there was a bit of trepidation as certain towns had their reputations.\" Longley says he was aware of maintaining civil society in a time of war. \"Northern Ireland deserved some arts and it also deserved to see what Northern Irish people were capable of producing.\" He received death threats from loyalists and complaints from the other side, which branded him a Protestant interloper because he was critical of the way official Irish artistic institutions had treated traditional artists. \"It wasn't pleasant, but in a way I valued their disapproval. I think it meant I was getting something right if they were both unhappy with me.\"</p> <p>McDonald says Longley was at the Arts Council \"during some of the darkest days in Ireland and he got his hands dirty by staying in Belfast when the lure of the creative writing professorship must have been great. He did the front-line cultural work at a time when culture seemed like the last thing that mattered to anyone and while the toiling away took its toll, that work was in itself a creative act.\"</p> <p>The Echo Gate (1979) was Longley's last collection for 12 years and, crucially for his reputation, his period of silence coincided with the growth of Irish studies as an academic discipline. The burst of critical scrutiny passed with no new work from him and he began to appear something of a peripheral figure. Increasingly unhappy in his job, he took early retirement in 1991 and even today the recollection of office politics from this period can provoke him to anger. However, with splendid synchronicity, Gorse Fires was published the very day he left his job and the positive response to it amazed and delighted him. \"I thought everyone would have forgotten who I was as I felt I was falling off the edge of the branch. Derek and Seamus had gone on writing, which added to the panic, so it did make me very happy.\"</p> <p>Patterson claims part of the reason for the success of his later work is that Longley is not predictable. \"This is a place where it is all too easy and frequent for people to assume people will respond in a particular way because of their religion at birth.\" He singles out the Gorse Fires poem about a murdered ice-cream man, which opens with a list of ice-cream flavours and ends with a mellifluous list of 20 wild flowers. \"I love the care with which he lists the flavours and the flowers and how that reminds us of the individual lives lost. It's very easy over here to get lost in the abstraction and the ideologies. But it is always necessary to go back to the humanity of the individual victims.\"</p> <p>McDonald says Longley's current public standing - something that seemed unlikely 15 years ago - is due to the fact that \"concepts like decency, honesty and integrity are in the bones of his artistry and he has never really deviated from the path. He never simplifies things as public poetry often does. For instance, that ceasefire poem includes what happens afterwards. It is only a ceasefire, not the end of the war. There is real, not reconciled pain at the end of the poem. To use the language of our time, he does not achieve closure.\"</p> <p>Despite Longley's avuncular appearance and manner - one friend described him as a cross between Santa Claus, Ernest Hemingway and God - his work is not exclusively affirming. As Brearton points out, \"it has the capacity to mourn, but deliberately doesn't say that it can console\". Following on from The Weather in Japan, which won the 2001 TS Eliot prize, the theme of ageing runs through Snow Water. Longley has stopped drinking and smoking, but is diabetic and acknowledges he should lose some weight. \"Great poetry is written by young men,\" he says. \"Then comes middle age and all these crises which I have been through, like drinking too much. Then, somehow, if you can get through that middle stretch, you break through to something else and I feel that my last few books have been my best.\"</p> <p>He says it has been a \"huge advantage\" to have faced all sorts of competition since the beginning of his career. \"Even if you were on your own, you say to yourself that you are practising an art that Keats and John Clare and George Herbert had practised. But it is much better to have other poets around you. I had just got used to writing near Derek Mahon at Trinity when I came here and met Seamus. After a while we thought we had it sewn up and then along come Muldoon and Ciaran Carson and Medbh McGuckian. Now there is another group of very bright young poets. I believe we are all biological entities that respond to stimuli. The envy gland is there and one always fears it is visible. And praise is important and so is criticism.\"</p> <p>Just before his father died, Longley had his first poem published in the undergraduate magazine. \"It was called 'Marsh Marigolds' and I showed it to my father. He said, 'Michael, it's not worth the paper it's written on.' In a way he was right, but I wanted him to like it and he shouldn't have said that. When I was with the Queen I showed her the photograph of my father getting the Military Cross from her grandfather and I asked her where it was taken. She recognised straight away it was in the gardens and arranged for an equerry to take me there at the end of the interview. So I went out and stood on the same spot and I was really quite tearful. And I thought of my dad being there all those years ago and said to myself that perhaps 'Marsh Marigolds' wasn't so awful after all.\"</p> <p><strong>Michael George Longley</strong><br><strong>Born:</strong> July 27 1939, Belfast.<br><strong>Education:</strong> 1951-58 Royal Belfast Academical Institution; '58-63 Trinity College Dublin.<br><strong>Family:</strong> 1964 married Edna Broderick (two daughters, Rebecca and Sarah, one son, Daniel).<br><strong>Career: </strong> 1963-69 schoolteacher in Dublin, London, Belfast; '70-91 Assistant director, Arts Council of Northern Ireland.<br><strong>Books: </strong> 1969 No Continuing City; '73 An Exploded View; '76 Man Lying on a Wall; '79 The Echo Gate; '91 Gorse Fires; '95 The Ghost Orchid; '98 Selected Poems; 2000 The Weather in Japan; '04 Snow Water.<br><strong>Awards:</strong> 1965 Eric Gregory award; '85 Commonwealth poetry prize; '91 Whitbread poetry award, 2000 Hawthornden prize, Irish Times literature prize; 2001 Queen's gold medal for poetry; TS Eliot prize.</p> <p><strong>&amp;#183:</strong> Michael Longley is reading at the Edinburgh book festival on August 22 and at Grasmere on August 24</p>",
  "<p>Emotions Revealed, by Paul Ekman (Phoenix, \u00a37.99) </p> <p> Emotions - what are they, and what can we do about them? Psychologist Ekman, a pioneer in emotion science, describes his decades of research into the physiological changes that occur during certain emotions, and his development of a method for reading \"micro-expressions\", tiny, fleeting changes in the face that advertise feelings, which has led law-enforcement agencies to solicit his services. We get lots of photographs of the author's daughter performing small facial movements to order, and detailed illustrations of what these express. Ekman also tries to give advice on how to control your own emotions (star appearance by the Dalai Lama) and recognise them in others. It's a bit irritating, though, that the text is festooned with adverts for the author's website, which promise we will find more groovy practice material, only for it to turn out that we would have to buy his special CDs. That caused some subtle changes in the musculature of my face. <strong>SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> When I Was Cool, by Sam Kashner (Century, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> Here's a literary rule that should be enforced with the threat of violence: only write a memoir if you have experienced something unusually interesting. Kashner passes the test, for this is the story of his time as a student at the \"Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics\" in Boulder, Colorado. He turned up in 1976 to study poetry with his idols Allen Ginsberg and William S Burroughs. The author's first student assignment comes when he is told to finish Ginsberg's poem about giving Neal Cassady a blowjob. Then he must babysit Gregory Corso (who wets the bed), study Buddhism, and hop into bed with various hippie women. Kashner tells a warm and poignant story of life with his ageing, drug-addled literary heroes (Burroughs went up in my estimation after I learned that he slept with a copy of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage under his pillow). In the end, it seems he got an excellent education. <strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Little Earth Book, by James Bruges (Fragile Earth, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> Star of this book is a little cartoon fish who swims about through the paragraphs thinking big thoughts, such as \"Why don't they abolish poverty?\" or \"Citizens seem more intelligent than governments\". This is a collection of mini-essays about all the global issues that should concern any self-respecting No Logo -reading freelance protester, such as declining cod stocks, deforestation, global warming, the oil economy, the arms trade, third-world debt, the notion of a basic citizens' income, water wars and genetic patents. Bruges collates a huge range of facts and figures, and has a nice line in polemical humour, referring derisively to \"flat-earth economists\". However he does evince a slightly twee, New Agey twang, and his insistence that humans must \"live within the rules set by nature\" is either silly agrarian atavism or just meaningless - probably the latter, since he does allow that genetic engineering \"may have great benefits\". <strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Shoot the Singer!, edited by Marie Korpe (Zed, \u00a315.95)</strong> </p> <p> You get a CD taped inside the back cover of this collection of essays about \"Music Censorship Today\", so you can listen to the cheerful, plinky waltz-time Mexican song which bigs up Osama bin Laden for frightening the Americans and relates a remarkable scene in which George Bush's wife tells him to go to Afghanistan and offer Bin Laden \"your ass\". The book does not suggest that this particular song has been censored, but it does describe how Mexico has seen many efforts to stamp out undesirable examples of the tradition of corrida , a sort of musical newspaper. Anyway, singer Andr\u00e9s Contreras should read the chapter about Bin Laden's Taliban mates, who banned all forms of music and burned musical instruments, before deciding whose side he's on. Other stories relate censorship and victimisation of musicians in Lebanon, Zimbabwe and Burma, and a few sparks of hope, such as the gradual reappearance of women musicians in Iran. <strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Einstein's Refrigerator: Tales of the Hot and Cold, by Gino Segr\u00e8 (Penguin, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> For physicist Gino Segr\u00e8, understanding the universe \"is one of our noblest pursuits\". Using temperature as a key to unlock nature's secrets, such as the origin of life, Segr\u00e8 takes us on a journey back to the super-heated atomic furnace of the Big Bang and then on to the Big Chill of absolute zero (-273C). At such low temperatures the bizarre behaviour of atoms (as in superconductivity) can only be explained using quantum mechanics, a field in which, as Segr\u00e8 puts it, \"even the subtleties have subtleties\". Segr\u00e8's \"temperature chronicle of our universe\" is a memorable celebration of the scientific search for understanding, even if in the end all we learn is that \"we are only special in realising how ordinary we truly are\". And yes, the greatest theoretical physicist of the 20th century did design a fridge. It didn't reach the high street; the appliance of science was never Einstein's forte.<strong> PDS</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity, by Jack Repcheck (Pocket Books, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> According to Stephen Jay Gould, James Hutton \"burst the boundaries of time\". His Theory of the Earth (1795) claimed that \"with respect to human observation, this world has neither a beginning nor an end\". In other words, the Earth was not created on October 23 4004BC, as the King James Bible said, but was unimaginably ancient. This insight was crucial to Darwin and provided the timescale over which evolution could work its slow magic. Hutton also grasped the geological importance of \"subterranean heat\". Born in Edinburgh, \"the father of modern geology\" didn't have to look far: Castle Rock is the basalt core of a volcano. Repcheck succeeds wonderfully in reviving this scientific hero, but even he has to admit that Hutton's key text was so turgid that it \"simply would not be read today\". A reason, perhaps, why Hutton has been unjustly obscured by the sands of time. PDS</p>",
  "<p>The Olympics are well under way and along with talk about athletic performance has come the inevitable scandals that surround the biggest media and commercial event on earth.</p> <p>The issue of drug taking was dominating the headlines before the flame was even lit in Athens last Friday, most strikingly against Greek sprinters Kostas Kederis and Katerina Thanou.</p> <p>Meanwhile coverage in the months leading up to the games tended to dwell on reports of spiraling costs, unfinished stadiums and terrorist threats.</p> <p>About the only thing that has been missing so far is sex. And that could soon find a place on the news agenda, with Durex apparently delivering 130,000 condoms and 30,000 sachets of lubricant to the Olympic village.</p> <p>They say that sport is a reflection of society at large, and all this seems to sum up ours pretty well. One thing we do not hear so much about at the beginning of the games these days, however, is politics.</p> <p>Time was when the stories and concerns surrounding the games were of an ideological and nationalistic variety, as they provided a grand stage on which to play out international conflicts and internecine rivalries. We seem a long way now from the Moscow games in 1980, which was boycotted by 65 countries in protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the previous year, or from Los Angeles in 1984 when the Soviet bloc, with the exception of Romania, returned the compliment.</p> <p>Political realities never seemed very far from the surface of the Olympic ideal. </p> <p>In 1976, 20 African nations stayed away from Montreal in protest against the All Blacks' rugby tour of South Africa at the time of the Soweto riots. Meanwhile, Taiwan pulled out when the Canadian government refused to recognise it as part of the People's Republic of China. Back in 1956 it had been China that had withdrawn from the Melbourne games in protest at Taiwanese participation, while Egypt, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland chose to stay away in deference to the Suez crisis and the Soviet invasion of Hungary earlier that year.</p> <p>The most dramatic and tragic intrusion of politics into the Olympics was the terrible hostage crisis at the Munich games of 1972, during which Palestinian guerrillas murdered 17 people, including 11 Israeli athletes.</p> <p>More typical, however, was the peaceful protest in Mexico City four years earlier when 200 metre sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos gave their \"black power\" salute on the winners' rostrum in the wake of the race riots across the southern United States in 1967. </p> <p>But probably the most infamous use of the Olympics to make political capital, of course, remains the Nazi games of 1936 in Berlin, the first ever to be televised. Hitler's aim to demonstrate the supremacy of the Aryan race would have succeeded - Germany topped the medal table - if the black American sprinter Jesse Owens had not spoiled the party by winning four gold medals and in the process becoming an Olympic legend.</p> <p>None of this should surprise us since throughout history organised sports have been used for political or propagandist purposes.</p> <p>The games of ancient Rome were charged with such overtones. There was no better way for a leader or local dignitary to curry favour among the masses or demonstrate his influence than to put on a games. Thus, when the emperor Trajan returned to Rome in 106, after defeating the Dacians, he staged a games lasting 123 days and using his prisoners of war as gladiators.</p> <p>Equally, opposing factions and families commonly extended their political rivalries into the arena through the champions and teams they sponsored. In the first decades AD for example, the Veneta and Prasina chariot-racing factions emerged in Rome, sporting blue and green colours respectively. Each represented different parties within the Senate and came to rival the established Albata (white) and Russata (red) interests.</p> <p>The rise and fall of organised sporting events suggests they have ever been subject to the whim of particular rulers or beholden to the vagaries of ideological fashion. The ancient Olympic games themselves were abolished in 393 by the Roman emperor Theodosius the Great because in a Christian context they were thought to be too closely associated with paganism. </p> <p>Throughout the Middle Ages tournaments were regularly held as displays of prestige and power or abolished when they appeared to pose threats to political stability. In England, Henry III outlawed them in the 1240s when they seemed to emphasise the conflict between the courtly faction and its rivals, and Edward I prohibited them again at the beginning of the 14th century.</p> <p>But perhaps the best example in British history of a sporting competition being used to make a political point came in around 1612 when the Gloucestershire gentleman Robert Dover created his \"Cotswold Games\" on the hill above Chipping Camden. It was a deliberate counterblast to the attempts of parliament, backed by the puritan clergy in the localities, to ban Sunday sports and curb communal merrymaking at Whitsuntide and other festivals. Dover even employed a Homeric harpist to give his games an Olympic feel.</p> <p>His ideal was to foster harmony between the social classes by combining gentry sports, such as hunting and chess, with popular pursuits, like skittles and cudgels.</p> <p>The king, James I, was sufficiently sympathetic to issue his \"Declaration of Sports\" in 1618 actively encouraging \"lawful recreations\", such as archery, leaping and vaulting in the interests both of general health and national security. The declaration was re-issued by his father, Charles I, in 1633 and formed part of the ideological struggle between Church and State, which would eventually precipitate civil war in 1642. Seldom in this country has sport been such an ideologically charged issue.</p> <p>\"Keep politics out of sport\" is a phrase often heard. But the former head of the International Olympic Committee, Lord Lillanin, was quite right when he said that \"politics are 'in' sport and have always been\".</p> <p>It is also true that the commercialism, corruption and chicanery of which we hear so much these days has always been in sport to one degree or another. But we can at least be thankful that the great ideological issues that persistently divided nations and undermined the games in the 20th century seem to be behind us for the moment. And that century has also left us with a tremendously positive legacy. When Athens hosted the first modern games in 1896, 250 white men took part from just 14 different countries. This month sees the massing of a reported 11,150 male and female competitors from more than 200 nations. There is as much to celebrate in those statistics as there will be to admire in the records broken during the sixteen days of Athens 2004.</p>",
  "<p>Language policy made a rare appearance in British headlines last month with the announcement of new \"tougher than expected\" language tests for citizenship applications. The home secretary, David Blunkett, surprised Esol practitioners by rejecting the advice of a Home Office committee, opting to set the bar at Esol Entry Level Three rather than the evidence of \"improvement\" recommended by the panel last year.</p> <p>The committee's advice does not, however, appear to be dead in the water. \"We will be announcing the way forward on this recommendation once the new combined English and Citizenship courses are available in the autumn,\" said a Home Office spokesperson.</p> <p>The new ruling means that all naturalisation candidates - including those married to British citizens - must provide an Esol Entry Level Three certificate, or written proof of an equivalent qualification, as part of the application process. \"It was quite a late move,\" said Dr Philida Shellekens, author of a 2001 Department for Education and Skills (DfES) report on English language and employment in the UK, \"and we're still working out what it might mean in practice. I know the Home Office are getting to grips with what this might look like on the ground.\"</p> <p>This has led to confusion for potential applicants. Cambridge ESOL, one of several awarding bodies providing the Skills for Life awards to which Entry Level Three belongs, has been fielding calls from within Britain and abroad as people seek clarification.</p> <p>\"People react swiftly, they want information,\" said Lee Knapp, Cambridge ESOL examinations development manager. \"In the last week or so we've been picking up numerous queries from people here in Britain interested in seeking naturalisation. A key point is that people are not being told that Skills for Life awards aren't available yet, and won't be available until the new college year starts in September.\"</p> <p>Many of those Mr Knapp has spoken to are already fluent (\"we've had lots of inquiries asking, 'Where can I get one of these Skills for Life awards' - in those very words\"), reflecting the huge range of language abilities represented within the Esol constituency.</p> <p>This ranges from refugees from war zones with limited study skills, to highly fluent speakers seeking membership of professional bodies such as the British Medical Association. In addition, any assessment needs to take into account Esol language users' typically \"spiky profiles\". \"You can't assume a person's reading and writing will be on the same level,\" explained Mr Knapp.</p> <p>Many practitioners are far from convinced that Entry Level Three will benefit the vulnerable people whose citizenship it is designed to endorse.</p> <p>Helen Sunderland, head of division for Esol at London South Bank University, where her department is involved in a DfES project developing material for ELT and Citizenship courses, said she had been surprised by the Blunkett decision to specify a target level. \"For some learners there'd be no problem at all, but if you've got people needing to learn English who can't read or write in their own language, who have been in camps, whose family are killed or missing, this could actually delay their applying for citizenship,\" she said.</p> <p>Bridget da Silva, who Esol teaches at Newcastle College, agrees. She is married to a Mozambican who has just received an award as best newcomer in a sales business, benefiting from excellent speaking skills despite having reading and writing skills that she estimates at Entry Level Two.</p> <p>\"We have so many students with spiky profiles,\" said Mrs da Silva, \"and in the majority of cases the weaker skills are the literacy skills. But I don't think this should hold them back from getting citizenship, or indeed from getting a meaningful job. I think making Entry Level Three the benchmark puts it out of reach of so many people with so much to offer, who are already marginalised. I'm not sure this is the best way to make them feel valued as a part of our society.\" Esol classes on the other hand could benefit, Sunderland said. \"The citizenship element could give teachers some interesting content to use about human rights and opportunities for participation, community and voluntary involvement.\"</p> <p>Dr Shellekens acknowledges the problems faced by asylum seekers, but argues that in the wider context Esol learner profiles are changing and converging with those typically found in EFL. Her DfES report showed that 60% of those interviewed had learned English in their country of origin. \"We should therefore assume literacy and study skills,\" she said. \"Many of the people seeking citizenship now are not the people who used to man the factories in industrial areas in the north - they're very well-educated and on a par with the native speakers. A lot of them may well be above Level Three, and Level Three is not an embarrassment of riches in language terms. We need to move on.\"</p> <p>Developments in the naturalisation process are being accompanied by initiatives to address language needs in the workplace. An estimated 1.5m people in Britain lack the English required to function in society and in work, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, has endorsed mandatory language training \"for those jobseekers whose language needs are preventing them from getting jobs.\"</p> <p>Year-long pilots at 12 locations began in April, with Esol courses for jobseekers lasting six months. \"Ideally, they should work towards achieving a qualification at Entry Three or Level One,\" said the Department for Works and Pensions, but - in this case echoing the Home Office panel recommendation - \"progress for those entering at pre-entry level can be slow, and it is acceptable for them to progress to the next level.\"</p> <p>Under a recent government spending review, voluntary and community organisations that promote English language skills \"among legal migrants to the UK\" are set to benefit from investment of $164m in a new \"Inclusive Communities\" fund.</p> <p>\"We welcome the additional funding,\" said a spokesperson for the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, adding that they expect further growth in a field already characterised by strong voluntary and community Esol involvement. \"It probably marks an ongoing trend where we will see greater resources being given to this sector.\"<br> </p> <p><strong>The new benchmark: Esol Entry Level Three</strong><br> <strong>Speaking and listening</strong><br> At this level adults can listen and respond to spoken language, including straightforward information and narratives, and follow straightforward explanations and instructions, both face-to-face and on the telephone.

  "<p>For someone who has made his fortune out of disturbingly angry music, Liam Howlett does not look terribly angst-ridden. Over the years, the records the Prodigy have released have been accused of everything from inciting arson to condoning domestic violence. They have caused enough controversy to garner comparisons with the Sex Pistols: the mere sight of Prodigy vocalist Keith Flint in the video for their 1996 number-one Firestarter - head shaved down the middle, remaining hair fashioned into two red spikes, make-up smeared face a pantomime of ridiculous snarls and gurns - was enough to provoke a storm of outraged calls to Top of the Pops. </p> <p>The band's members have engaged in public slanging matches with the Beastie Boys and Moby, artists perturbed by the title of the Prodigy's 1997 hit, Smack My Bitch Up. And yet, as he lounges on a roof terrace in Camden, Howlett seems a veritable picture of softly spoken contentment. The closest he comes to doing anything outrageous is drowning a wasp in his bottle of Smirnoff Ice, unless you count his heroic dedication to swearing, which would impress even his prospective brother-in-law, Liam Gallagher (He is married to former All Saints star Natalie Appleton, whose sister Nicole is Gallagher's partner.) During one spirited assault on the state of contemporary music, Howlett manages to use the word \"fucking\" 14 times in six sentences. </p> <p>His turn of phrase can make the simple act of sampling an old record sound surprisingly disturbing: \"I like taking other people's shit,\" he says, \"and squeezing it and moulding it.\" Perhaps his good humour is down to relief. It is seven years since the last Prodigy album, the 8.5 million-selling The Fat of the Land, and four years since Howlett embarked upon making its follow-up. He announced it would be called Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned, over the internet in 2001, but despite the cocky title, the making of the album proved anything but smooth. </p> <p>Howlett suffered a lengthy bout of writer's block. Dancer Leroy Thornhill left the band shortly after work commenced, although Howlett claims his departure was down to nothing more sinister than a leg injury: \"His dancing days are over,\" he nods, without a hint of irony. In 2002, much to the chagrin of his record company, Howlett scrapped a semi-completed album, after the release of the single Baby's Got a Temper, a flatly awful concoction of uninspired music and platitudinous lyrical outrage. Its references to date-rape drug Rohypnol led to a BBC ban, but the sense that all concerned were trying too hard to shock was impossible to escape. </p> <p>\"I think we were starting to take ourselves a little too seriously,\" he concedes. \"I'm glad it came out, because it really gave me a kick up the arse. It made me analyse what I'm about.\" He came to the conclusion that neither Flint nor longstanding rapper Keith \"Maxim\" Palmer should appear on the new album. Instead, he would call upon guest vocalists, including Gallagher, actress Juliette Lewis and Kool Keith of legendary 80s rap act Ultramagnetic MCs. </p> <p>It's certainly a brave move, to ditch the public face of the Prodigy at a crucial juncture in the band's career, but you can't imagine the news going down terribly well with the rest of the band, particularly considering that the solo projects they had launched after The Fat Of The Land - an eponymous punk band for Flint, a rap album, Hell's Kitchen, for Palmer - had resolutely failed to set the world alight. </p> <p>\"Was that a difficult conversation to have? Erm, it wasn't quite as simple as that. After Baby's Got a Temper, they knew I wasn't into it. I told them: this is a load of shit. I recorded a couple of new tracks and pulled them into the studio and said, Listen, we all want this shit to continue, I'm going to write an album that we can all perform live, that's all you need to worry about. Basically, we've got to put the focus back on the music. Initially, they didn't understand the angle, but once they heard the music, I think Keith was relieved, actually. Prior to The Fat of the Land, they weren't in the studio much anyway. They only turned up as mates to hear what I'd done.\" </p> <p>The best moments of Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned - the implausibly sleazy opening track Spitfire, Gallagher's fantastic, deranged closing number Shoot Down - suggest the gamble has paid off, and Howlett is bullish about the album's contents: \"It's me with my fists in the air, it makes me feel 10 ft tall.\" </p> <p>But he is also pragmatic about its commercial chances after seven years in which rock and pop music have changed drastically: the last time the Prodigy released an album, dance music was still a major commercial force, no one had heard of Simon Cowell and people still seriously compared Oasis with the Beatles: \"When you're a new band, you come out, fresh to new ears, that's fucking exciting. We'll never have that again, but we've got the next best thing - a whole new generation of kids. It's like a challenge. None of us are under the illusion that it's going to be easy, but it's good to come out as the underdog, come out fighting again and say: listen to this.\" </p> <p>When the Prodigy were a new band, few observers ever thought they would have to face the dilemma of how to finish their fourth album. With the best will in the world, they did not look like a band built to last. They emerged in 1991 from the Essex branch of the \"hardcore\" scene, the dafter, faster, less elitist, offspring of acid house. It was at the hardcore raves that dance music's sillier excesses were born: boggle-eyed ravers in white gloves and fluorescent clothes, sucking dummies or sporting smog masks smeared with Vicks VapoRub decongestant, the smell of which was reputed to enhance the effects of ecstasy. </p> <p>The Prodigy's first hit, Charly, reached number two. It sampled the mewing of a cartoon cat from an early 70s public information film. It was, to all intents and purposes, a novelty record, an accusation that still rankles with Howlett: \"I stand by that record. It's a great fucking tune. Whether or not it was comical, who gives a shit? It was the imitators afterwards that were the problem.\" They certainly were. Charly's success spawned a short-lived movement dubbed \"toytown techno\", in which hardcore producers raided vintage children's television for jokey inspiration. </p> <p>Like the long-forgotten makers of A Trip to Trumpton, Sesame's Treet and Roobarb And Custard, the Prodigy were widely expected to vanish overnight, an impression that their early live shows did little to dispel. \"They were insane,\" Howlett chuckles. \"Just drug-fuelled, ecstasy-fuelled, a real laugh. We used to do nine or 10 songs with Keith and Leroy dancing. You turned up at the rave, it was run by gangsters, you didn't know whether or not you were going to get paid. They were full of characters, people who were completely twatted. It was an adventure.\" </p> <p>A horrified Mixmag magazine accused Howlett of single-handedly turning dance music from an ultra-cool and wildly subversive folk devil into a national laughing stock, an opinion widely shared by the club cognoscenti. Yet the Prodigy resolutely failed to fade away. They transformed themselves into serious, globally popular artists with their second album, 1994's dark, complex Music For The Jilted Generation, a record which, Howlett rightly points out, \"made a lot of the dance scene seem throwaway\". </p> <p>With the release of The Fat of the Land, they briefly became the biggest band in the world: in its first week of release, it entered the charts at number one in 23 countries. Firestarter remains the most extreme piece of music ever to top the charts. And yet somehow, the stigma of Charly has never been entirely eradicated. </p> <p>The Prodigy have been groundbreaking, controversial, critically lauded, musically influential and wildly successful, yet they have never really been fashionable. Flint may have minted one of the most striking images in recent pop history but you never saw anyone copy it. The makers of a late-90s TV ad for an energy drink dressed a pensioner up as Flint to evoke their product's vigour-giving properties (an unamused Flint, displaying what might charitably be described as a shaky grasp of the mechanics of advertising, later threatened to beat up the aged actor, apparently feeling he was responsible for the entire commercial), but that was it: dressing like a cross between a clown and the sort of punk you used to see on postcards in London tourist shops seemed a step too far even for the most rebellious teen. </p> <p>\"We had to really fight to get respect,\" says Howlett. \"The dance scene in particular has always been quite snobby against us.\" He has relentlessly baited clubbers in the past, memorably telling one journalist that he hoped Ibiza got bombed. Understandably, he is unmoved by dance music's recent decline in fortunes. \"I really don't know much about it to be honest. I don't listen to much dance music. That kind of Ibiza music, that shit that Pete Tong plays, I hate that shit. I sound like my dad, but it's fucking music by numbers. The lack of imagination does my brain in. Like, if I'm in a petrol station and the dude pulls in with his fucking shades and his nice shirt and his car stereo playing his Ibiza music, it just fucking irritates me. They're so fucking annoying. It's so stale, something needs to poke out. It would be cool to have bands that are like, electronic bands with leather jackets on, but with no guitars, no drum-kits, just raw electronics. If there's any fucking kids out there, I'm up for producing you, because I'm into the idea of creating an army against the DJs.\" </p> <p>Even today, 15 million albums later, Howlett still seems entirely removed from accepted notions of cool. Today, he is sporting a pair of trainers that appear to be made of fluorescent pink faux-ponyskin. He drinks alcopops. Like Alan Partridge, he is steadfast in the belief that Roger Moore was the quintessential James Bond: \"In my bedroom, glass of Jack Daniel's, Moonraker or Octopussy on the DVD - I'm a happy man.\" </p> <p>As with Depeche Mode, something of Essex still inexplicably clings to the Prodigy, even when they're filling stadiums in the midwest of America. Howlett is rather pleased about this. \"It seems a really English thing. Americans seem to rape and pillage music scenes but they don't do it as well. Like punk - they had the punk thing in the palm of their hands, but they didn't know what to do with it. It was England that made it a scene. It was England that made dance music a scene, they made it important, not just disco. That's what I mean when I say I'm proud to be English. No other country in the world can do that.\" </p> <p>The criticism levelled at the Prodigy's early career seems to have had one other lasting effect upon Howlett's character. He has the sort of trenchant, implacable attitude to concepts like \"selling out\" and the inherent evil of commercial pop that you more commonly find in a teenage Kerrang! reader than a 32-year-old multimillionaire producer. Howlett has made some of the greatest pop music of the last decade, but you suspect that if you said that to his face, he would be mortally offended. </p> <p>When Pete Townshend, misreading the songwriting credits for Firestarter, mistakenly claimed in an interview that Howlett had co-written it with Frankie Goes to Hollywood producer Trevor Horn, Howlett felt compelled to ring the Who guitarist up: \"I couldn't have him thinking I made a record with one of those twats.\" He talks about going to Dave Stewart's wedding - \"lots of people there, Bono, Jagger\" - then quickly qualifies himself: \"I wasn't impressed at all.\" </p> <p>He was similarly unmoved when Madonna asked him to DJ at her London concert. \"It was shite,\" he says, apparently untroubled by the fact that Madonna owns the Prodigy's US record label, Maverick. \"She phoned me up at two in the morning. I was like 'How did you get my number?' And she said 'Come on, I'm Madonna.' I did it for the money. I got twenty grand. I liked the idea of playing the Sex Pistols and some other obscene shit to Madonna's fans, but I knew it wasn't going to be any good.\" </p> <p>He says his attitude to pop nearly scuppered his relationship with Appleton, by whom he has a five-month-old son, Ace. \"Keith comes round my house and says 'We should go to V2000'. I was like, 'OK, what bands are on?' I open the paper and the first band I see is All Saints. I said, 'I'm not going there! I don't want to see fucking All Saints!' That was the head I had on me - I wasn't into any type of pop music. But I ended up going and that's how I met her.\" </p> <p> In theory at least, the relationship should have catapulted Howlett into the pages of Heat and OK!. The Appletons are the kind of pop stars for whom tabloid publicity is more integral to their success than any musical considerations: their debut album famously had its release date changed because of the media furore created by the sisters' tell-all biography. </p> <p>Howlett says he simply avoids the paparazzi's haunts: \"I don't go to film premieres and fancy restaurants.\" But surely his wife needs to be seen in those places for the benefit of her career? Does she never say, \"Oh, come on, love, do me a favour, come to the Met Bar\"? No, he says, she's not like that. \"She's actually really cool. I would not have gone out with her if she was a headline-grabber. When we go out with Liam and Nic, it's always funny, they're always going to get that kind of attention. While they're getting photographed, me and Nat just bomb off, it's great. Liam fucking hates it. The press provoke him. You know they do, man. I've been out to places with him, and the photographers are deliberately shouting things out, just so they can get a picture. I don't know if I could cope with that level of fame. People thinking they know you when they don't. </p> <p>\"I saw it happen with Keith as well. One guy comes up to him in an airport, goes: 'All right Keith?', rubs his head as if he's some mascot or something, then goes, 'You want to cut your hair'. So Keith grabs him by the scruff of the neck, and goes: 'You want to lose some weight you fat cunt'.\" Howlett laughs. \"That sums it up really.\" </p> <p>He says a paparazzo has annoyed him only once, after the birth of his son. \"I was walking up the street with the pram. They grab a couple of pictures. Cool. Then I walked up the road and they were hiding behind lampposts and shit. That ain't on, mate.\" </p> <p>His voice rises in indignation. \"They were all over the fucking place, trying to get pictures inside of the fucking pram. And I'm like, for fuck's sake. I don't need that shit to sell records.\" It is the first time he has sounded remotely angry all afternoon. \"Nah. All the anger on the records just comes out of battling with myself, to make the tracks better. Politics? It's never political for us. We just write music for people to go 'yeah!' to. To be honest with you,\" he grins, \"I've never been angry about anything in my fucking life.\"</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS</b>: US forces launched an intense bombardment of Mahdi militia positions in Najaf overnight as Moqtada al-Sadr rejected a final offer to retreat. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1287251,00.html\">More details</a></p> <p><b>SADR DEFIANT</b></p> <p>\"Ayad Allawi's ultimatum yesterday to the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr ... was notable for one thing: the lack of a deadline,\" writes the Guardian's Michael Howard. Nonetheless, the paper says the \"final offensive\" to drive Mr Sadr's Mahdi army out of Najaf could be hours away - and indeed it appeared to have begun as the Wrap was being published. The Iraqi PM would have been in danger of damaging his credibility if he had waited any longer.</p> <p>The militia are apparently running out of food, ammunition and water. \"Mr Sadr has managed to outwit his enemies with an extraordinary display of brinkmanship,\" the paper says. \"[But] it seems unlikely he can hang on much longer.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph is worried about a different sort of threat from Mr Sadr's militants.

Earlier this week, the Guardian published an ICM poll suggesting that voters still ranked domestic issues - the NHS, education and crime - as their most important considerations when deciding how to vote. Iraq was not a major factor.</p> <p>But the FT's poll paints quite a different picture. Asked about the \"most important issues facing Britain today\", 38% cited defence and foreign affairs and 30% \"race relations\". But it also suggests the Lib Dems, who opposed the war, are falling behind again, with voters disappointed by Charles Kennedy's performance.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1287093,00.html\">Najaf faces final assault</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1287068,00.html\">Analysis: Michael Howard</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/20/wirq20.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/08/20/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Rebels threaten oil</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/77b3ae02-f220-11d8-861d-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Iraq war shifts voters' priorities</a><br> * <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/polls/story/0,11030,1285307,00.html\">August 18: Iraq given a low priority by voters</a></p> <p><b>'NIGHTMARE WITHOUT END'</b></p> <p>The Herald Tribune reports on a \"new influx\" of Sudanese refugees crossing the border into Chad.

  "<p>The UN refugee agency accused Sudan yesterday of breaking its promises in Darfur, as more refugees fled to neighbouring Chad from a fresh wave of attacks on civilians. </p> <p>Hundreds have crossed the border in recent weeks after assaults on 11 villages which fitted the pattern of the government-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing in the westerrn region. </p> <p>The UN fears that a further 100,000 refugees may head for Chad in the coming months and has drawn up contingency plans to build a further seven camps near the border. </p> <p>There are already nine vast camps along the border, holding an estimated 190,000 people, and a tenth is being built. </p> <p>Lino Bordin, deputy representative of the UN high commissioner for refugees in Chad, said the villages had been attacked in waves, beginning with an aerial bombardment. </p> <p>\"The refugees said that 11 villages were attacked from the 2nd to the 10th of August. They were attacked by plane, and after that by cars full of soldiers, and after that by the Janjaweed [militia],\" he said. </p> <p>\"These are broken promises by Sudan. They promised that they would start to solve this situation, but that has not happened yet. </p> <p>\"The refugees have arrived in the camps suffering from malnutrition and dehydration, and without any of their possessions. They came with nothing. When the Janjaweed arrived, they stole everything from the houses.\" </p> <p>The latest refugees have trickled across the border in small bands rather than in the vast movement of people seen earlier this year. </p> <p>The UN predicts that there will continue to be a refugee crisis on the Chad border for at least another year and is stepping up its plans to feed people in the camps as heavy rains continue to block vital roads. </p> <p>The UN world food programme is planning to start airdropping food in the coming weeks, and the warming of relations between Libya and the west has enabled the opening of an overland supply route through the Libyan desert. </p> <p>Robert Gillenwater, the programme's head of logistics in Chad, has worked in the Cambodian jungles, where he used elephants to get supplies through, and in the Himalayas, where porters had to carry food sacks over mountains. </p> <p>But he described feeding Darfur's refugees as \"one of the biggest challenges in the 10 years I've been in the WFP\". </p> <p>At the WFP's Chadian headquarters in the capital N'Djamena he said: \"You couldn't ask for more cooperation from the Chadian government. </p> <p>\"They have been very, very supportive. </p> <p>\"The donor countries have been coming through - donors have been pledging and giving. Those two elements are in place, but mother nature is not cooperating.\" </p> <p>The UN has been bringing food shipments overland from the Atlantic coast to N'Djamena, and then down a 560 miles road to Abech\u00e9, the eastern town which has become a hub for the relief operation. </p> <p>The road to the east was once properly surfaced but has been allowed to crumble into of broken tarmac and soil. </p> <p>In the wet season it has to be closed, because truck wheels grinding through the mud would destroy what is left of the road. </p> <p>Then the UN convoys have to take an 870-mile detour through the desert to reach Abech\u00e9. </p> <p>Many of the routes from there to the border are criss-crossed by wadis - dry riverbeds which fill with floodwater during the rains. </p> <p>A truck caught crossing a wadi when it floods is in danger of being swept away. Three UN vehicles have already been lost in this fashion. </p> <p>To spare the trucks, the UN has been employing porters to carry the bags of food across the wadis from one vehicles to another. </p> <p>The huge international effort to support the refugees has caused tension with the local people in the border region of Chad. The villagers who shared their food with the refugees when they first arrived are now having to struggle to feed themselves adequately in the traditionally lean period between planting in May and the harvest in November. </p> <p>The Chadian government says the influx of civilians fleeing violence in Darfur has placed an enormous burden on its country, one of the poorest in the world. </p> <p>It is afraid that a further big influx of refugees could destabilise the already fragile Chadian economy.</p>",
  "Dust storms emanating from the Sahara have increased tenfold in 50 years, contributing to climate change as well as threatening human health and destroying coral reefs thousands of miles away. <p>And one major cause is the replacement of the camel by four-wheel drive vehicles as the desert vehicle of choice. </p> <p>Andrew Goudie, professor of geography at Oxford University, blames the process of Toyotarisation - a coinage reflecting the near-ubiquitous desert use of Toyota Land Cruisers - for destroying a thin crust of lichen and stones that has protected vast areas of the Sahara from the wind for centuries. </p> <p>Four-wheel drive use, along with overgrazing and deforestation, were the major causes of the world's growing dust storm problem, the scale of which was much bigger than previously realised, Prof Goudie, master of St Cross College, told the International Geographical Congress in Glasgow yesterday. </p> <p>\"I am quite serious, you should look at deserts from the air, scarred all over by wheel tracks, people driving indiscriminately over the surface breaking it up. Toyotarisation is a major cause of dust storms. If I had my way I would ban them from driving off-road.\" </p> <p>The problem has become so serious that an estimated 2-3bn tonnes of dust is carried away on the wind each year. Storms in the Sahara transport dust high into the atmosphere and deposit it as far away as Greenland and the US. </p> <p>Britain was seeing increasing levels of \"blood rain\" in spring that came direct from the Sahara, Prof Goudie said. From an aircraft over the Alps in summer it was possible to see the telltale colour of red dust on the mountains. </p> <p>Although the storms are mainly particles of quartz, smaller than grains of sand, they also contain salt and quantities of pesticide and herbicide which can cause serious health problems. Microbe-laden dust from storms is also credited with carrying cattle diseases such as foot and mouth. </p> <p>The world's largest single dust source is the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 depression in Chad, between an ever-shrinking Lake Chad (now a twentieth of its size in the 1960s) and the Sahara. The depression releases 1,270m tonnes of dust a year, 10 times more than when measurements began in 1947, according to Prof Goudie's research. </p> <p>Taking the whole Sahara, and the Sahel to the south, dust volumes had increased four to sixfold since the 1960s. Countries worst affected were Niger, Chad, northern Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania, the research found. </p> <p><b>Smothering of coral reefs</b><br> </p> <p>But the effects went far beyond. In the Caribbean, scientists had directly linked the death of coral reefs to smothering by dust which had travelled 3,000 miles. </p> <p>African dust had also found its way to Greenland, Prof Goudie said. While white ice reflected sunlight and remains frozen, the dark dust on top absorbed the sun's heat, causing the ice to melt and accelerating the raising of sea levels. </p> <p>Prof Goudie said it was as yet uncertain what other effects the dust was having on the climate. The airborne dust both reflected sunlight back into space and blanketed the earth holding the heat in. When it dropped in the sea it fertilised the plankton which absorbed carbon dioxide and cooled the ocean surface, creating fewer clouds and less rain - a vicious circle which made the dust problem worse. </p> <p>Where the dust source was the dried-up bed of a salt lake or sea, salt deposited from the storms could ruin agricultural land, leading to more deserts and more dust. There might be more serious consequences for human health emerging elsewhere in the world. </p> <p>The Aral Sea in central Asia had almost dried up, according to the research. Its inflowing rivers were used for irrigating cotton, causing the seabed to be contaminated by pesticide toxins which were now being blown about in the dust. People who have breathed in the dust have serious allergic reactions. </p> <p>Prof Goudie also warned that climate change might cause dust problems to return to the US prairies. While improved agricultural practices, wind breaks and higher rainfall had cured the Dust Bowl of the 1930s (immortalised in John Steinbeck's novel the Grapes of Wrath), the conditions were once again similar. Dust storms were now common in the US and could lead to a disease, Valley Fever, an allergic reaction to pesticides in the dust which caused inflammation of the nose and throat, killing several people a year. </p> <p>In China, extensive efforts had been made to plant trees to hold back the dust, and increases in rainfall had also helped, the study found. However, large dust storms were still emanating from the vast deserts in the north, which included the Lopnor nuclear test site - raising fears that storms could interfere with the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and might contain radioactive particles. The Chinese have said they were confident this would not happen. </p> <p><b>Choking storms hit far and wide</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Dust storms are typically 200km (125 miles) wide and carry 20 to 30m tonnes of dust. Some carry up to 100m tonnes </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Worldwide dust in the atmosphere is predicted to be 2bn-3bn tonnes this year </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Florida receives more than 50% of the African dust that hits the US, causing increased respiratory problems </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mauritania, which had two dust storms a year in the early 1960s, now has 80 a year </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The worst dust storm to reach Britain was in 1903 when an estimated 10m tonnes landed from the Sahara</p>",
  "<p>Anyone out there who associates badminton with old-fashioned ideas of decorous behaviour can think again. Last night's mixed doubles final, in which Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson of Britain conceded the gold medal to Gao Ling and Zhang Jun of China, was rancorous, raucous and almost spitefully competitive. </p> <p>Boxing rings have men prepared to swab blood off the canvas and curling teams brush ice from the path of the stone, but badminton is one of the few sports that employ attendants specifically to mop sweat off the playing surface at frequent intervals. At the end of this 93-minute marathon, the Goudi Centre's moppers had been working overtime, as had the umpire. </p> <p>Gao and Zhang won by 15-1, 12-15, 15-12 in a match of fluctuating mastery and increasing excitement. Several bracing disputes were encouraged and enjoyed by a volatile crowd of about 4,000, in which the Chinese narrowly outnumbered and outshouted the British. </p> <p>As the first set disappeared in 12 minutes, Emms and Robertson appeared to have mislaid their spirit as well as their form. But an enthralling comeback in the second prefaced a decider in which both sides seized the initiative before the champions proved more adept at holding their nerve on the big points. </p> <p>\"It was a tough game and it was close,\" Robertson said, \"but I have to look at this as an overall performance in the tournament, and the silver medal was an absolute dream for both of us. We played our hearts out in every round.\" </p> <p>The tension between the British pair and the defending champions was evident from the start, when a volley of explosive overheads from Zhang set Emms and Robertson back on their heels. Within a couple of minutes, or so it seemed, the Chinese pair had raced to a 9-0 lead. In taking that ninth point, the left-handed Zhang hit a behind-the-back shot which induced a netted backhand from Robertson. The virtuosity had not been strictly necessary, and it seemed designed to rub in the superiority the Chinese were enjoying. </p> <p>Frustration and anger were behind the sizzling overhead with which Robertson belatedly got Britain off the mark, but the next half-dozen points dribbled away and it was no surprise when the game was lost to another Zhang smash. This one was delivered with both feet about three feet in the air and to the accompaniment of an exultant scream which seemed to promise an afternoon of prolonged humiliation. </p> <p>At that stage the blame was difficult to apportion. Robertson looked dreamy while Emms lacked precision. \"It may have been something to do with final nerves,\" Robertson said, \"but they came out faster than us and they blew us off the court, really. Sometimes it takes a game to get used to the pace of the Chinese. They play at a different pace - and these two are different even from the other Chinese pairs.\" </p> <p>Before this game they had met on three occasions, with the record standing at 2-1 in favour of China. </p> <p>\"They're a fantastic big-time tournament pair,\" Robertson said, \"and it's been a year since we played them, and that's probably why we took a while to get used to it.\" </p> <p>After a lecture from one of their coaches, the British pair attacked the second game with a more aggressive attitude. Robertson took the initiative, emulating Zhang's work in the previous game with a series of powerful winners, while Emms started to show her touch at the net. They fought their way to a 6-1 lead and then allowed the Chinese to fight back to 14-12 before Robertson won the game with a hair-raising decision to allow a shot from Zhang to drop an inch or two beyond the baseline. </p> <p>Emms performed the badminton equivalent of shadow-boxing at the net during the break preceding the final game, and suddenly she was winning her fair share of points as she and her partner went 7-3 up. </p> <p>Zhang complained that the British were wasting time, received a sermon from the umpire, and then supervised some time-wasting of his own in an attempt to wrest back the initiative. At 8-8 and then 11-11 the stadium was in pandemonium, but it was the Chinese who increased the pressure sufficiently to force the errors that gave them the victory. </p> <p>\"I hate losing,\" Emms said afterwards. \"For me it wasn't just a gold medal match. I'd blotted that out of my head. I was just going out there to win. I'm absolutely gutted.\" </p> <p>Robertson confirmed that there had been a degree of feeling in the match. \"There was always going to be quite a lot of needle out there,\" he said. \"There's definitely not a lot of friendship between the Europeans and the Asians. But give credit to the Chinese. They were probably a couple of points better than us, which isn't a lot. They deserved it on the day.\" </p> <p>This was Britain's best performance in the Olympic badminton tournament, improving on the bronze medal won by Joanne Wright-Goode and Simon Archer in Sydney. Emms and Robertson, who play in Denmark's professional league, plan to stick together. \"I'm thirsty for more,\" Robertson said. \"We've improved all the way up to these Olympics, and we're young enough to look forward to Beijing. We'll be 31 then, and in European terms that's not old at all, so there is no reason why we can't be even better, if everything goes smoothly.\"</p>",

  "More than 8000 women are working as prostitutes in flats, saunas and massage parlours and via escort agencies in London, according to the first comprehensive study of the \"off-street\" sex trade in the capital. <p>Four-fifths of those are from overseas and many have been trafficked into the country from eastern Europe and south east Asia by criminal gangs who force them to work in brutal conditions. Some have been kidnapped and beaten, while others are brought into the country under false pretences. </p> <p>Sex in the City, published yesterday by the Poppy Project, which supports women trying to leave the sex trade, maps prostitution across London. </p> <p>Superintendent Chris Bradford, head of operations for the Metropolitan police's clubs and vice unit, warned that the issue was widespread within Britain and across western Europe. \"We have been telling people about this for an awfully long time,\" he said. \"I would suggest every town in the UK has got a problem.\" </p> <p>The six-month study found 730 brothels and 164 escort agencies operating in the capital, as well as 66 lap-dancing clubs, some of which appeared to be connected to prostitution. </p> <p>Many had linked telephone numbers, suggesting that a network of criminals or criminal groups was cooperating, allowing perhaps 1,000 women to be moved around to avoid detection and keep them isolated. \"The numbers of women involved in this and the experiences they go through are shocking,\" Sandra Dickson, the report's author, said. </p> <p>\"The off-street sex industry is largely ignored in most discussions of prostitution, yet the women working in it are also vulnerable to being exploited by violent and abusive pimps and traffickers. </p> <p>\"Women trafficked into prostitution told us they worked alongside other trafficked women all over London. These places are on our local high streets, and they're not a 'bit of fun for the lads' - they are places women are being held in and hurt.\" </p> <p>The study says that more funding is needed to help the police tackle the problem. It calls for greater support for women trafficked to this country, ensuring that they have safe housing and are granted asylum if they cannot return home safely. But it also urges the government to tackle the problem of demand, including information within sex education lessons on the realities of prostitution, to educate men who buy sex about its effects on the women involved. </p> <p>A similar programme in San Francisco claims that only 18 of the 2,000 men it has worked with have been rearrested on prostitution-related offences. </p> <p>Ms Dickson pointed out that accounts from clients made it clear that many men used prostitutes even if they knew the women were clearly unhappy. Her report shows that while some women are kidnapped and beaten, others are not \"stereotypical\" trafficking victims and may have been \"deceived as well as coerced\" into working in the sex industry in the UK. </p> <p>One interviewee came to Britain to raise money for her sister's cancer treatment. Her recruiter had promised her that she would be able to make \"enormous\" amounts of money, that clients would be clean and that she could negotiate safe sex. Instead she had to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week. Half of her earnings were taken as \"rent\" for the flat where she was prostituted; the other half on a \u00a323,000 \"debt\" for travel arrangements. </p> <p>Supt Bradford said many women found it impossible to escape their pimps once they had arrived in the UK. \"They can't speak the language; they've had passports and travel documents taken away from them,\" he said. \"They don't know what to do or who to see, and pimps tell them that they're paying the police, and that we will just return them if they come to us. They're not necessarily locked up, but there's the constant threat that they or their families will be 'sorted out'.\" </p> <p>But returning home can be equally difficult, because of the stigma the women can face, and because they have often been driven out by a lack of employment opportunities in the first place. </p> <p>Several of the women helped by the Poppy Project were retrafficked after their return to their countries of origin. One was sold by her father for a second time days after police returned her to her home. </p> <p>The Met's off-street prostitution team has just 15 officers, but last year dealt with about 500 women who were being pimped in brothels. Every one of the 109 arrests it has made for pimping since 2000 resulted in a conviction, Supt Bradford said.</p> <p><b>The figures</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> There are 730 flats, parlours and saunas selling sex in London. Westminster has 138 premises, while other boroughs average 19 sites to buy sex, each with four to eight women on average. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Only 19% of these women are British. The remainder are from eastern Europe (25%), 13% from south-east Asia, 12% from western Europe and 2% from Africa. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Up to 2,200 women are selling sex via London's 164 escort agencies. Again, only around a fifth of these are British. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Linked telephone numbers indicate a connection between 88 sites selling sex across the United Kingdom, indicating that women could be moved between different sites to escape detection and ensure they remained isolated. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Fifteen boroughs have no sexual health outreach provision for women in the sex industry at all, and where services exist they are often not adequately resourced. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ten main areas are identified as locations for street prostitution, although it is likely to go on in other boroughs. Most women selling sex on the street are African, Caribbean, British and Irish. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Research carried out in 2000 suggests that up to 1,420 women are trafficked annually into the UK for sexual exploitation. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Investigative journalist Victor Malarek, whose book The Natashas examines the global sex trade, estimates that trafficking women generates about \u00a36.6bn a year. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> According to the Home Office, about 80,000 people are involved in prostitution throughout Britain. As many as 70% of the women on the streets were coerced into prostitution as young people, and as many as 90% of them have a class A drug habit.</p>",
  "<p>I've just asked Ken Loach if he is a \"romantic\". The 67-year-old director seems perplexed by the question. \"No, not really, no, no ... I can't think of any way that would apply to me,\" he says, as if someone had just inquired if he ever votes Tory. Nonetheless, there is a strong romantic undertow to his new film, Ae Fond Kiss, the third part of his so-called \"Glasgow trilogy\" with writer Paul Laverty (after My Name Is Joe and Sweet Sixteen). </p> <p>The archaic-sounding title comes from an old Robert Burns poem. It's a story of love across the ethnic divide. Roisin (Eva Birthistle) is a young Catholic teacher who starts an affair with Casim (Atta Yaqub), a second-generation Scottish-Pakistani. The hitch is that he is due to marry his cousin in nine weeks' time and his parents, Tariq and Sadia, devout Muslims, are appalled that he has chosen to live with a \"goree\", a white girl. </p> <p>For Loach and Laverty, Ae Fond Kiss is about assimilation, racism, arranged marriages and the problems of immigrant families. Laverty says he was inspired to write the film by the events in the wake of 9/11, when \"Muslims were demonised\". He had heard from friends how Scottish-Asian kids were targeted and bullied after the terrorist attacks and he wanted to explore \"another part of Scottish culture\". Loach, for his part, describes the relationship at the heart of Ae Fond Kiss in typically downbeat language. \"It's two people who fancy each other, and want to be together, and get on - that's not romantic: that's the way you are when you meet somebody you really enjoy being with; like and laugh with and are touched by and care for.\" </p> <p>Whatever the writer and director claim, many audiences are likely to take Ae Fond Kiss as a romantic drama: an East Is East-style version of Romeo and Juliet relocated to the south side of Glasgow. Even the actress Eva Birthistle describes it as \"a love story ... a very gentle love story.\" For once in a Loach movie, there are few explicit political references. This is nothing like the account of the bungled privatisation of the railways (The Navigators) or of the justice-for-janitor campaign in the US (Bread and Roses). The real emphasis is on the family - and the threat that Casim's affair with a white woman poses to it. In particular, Casim risks ruining for ever his relationship with his revered father (Ahmad Riaz). </p> <p>Loach acknowledges that there are parallels with his own experiences. When he gave up his legal career to work in drama, his father (an electrician) was intensely disappointed. \"But he came round in the end. When I got a job at the BBC, that was seen as respectable ... he thought that was a steady job because the money came in regularly.\" </p> <p>Loach is a deceptively mild-mannered film-maker. On set, Birthistle recalls, he was \"very friendly and unassuming and gentle and vicar-like, but he has a clever way of making you believe you came up with an idea when actually he is getting his way.\" His methods are well known. He shoots in sequence, rarely rehearses, and doesn't allow his actors (many of whom are non-professionals) to know in advance what is going to happen to the characters they play. </p> <p>\"It's a liberating way to work,\" Birthistle says. \"It keeps you on your toes. It's as close to real life as is humanly possible. You don't know what's around the next corner. </p> <p>\"But we were trying to wheedle information out of crew members, who've all read the script, after they'd had a couple of drinks in the pub. They get frightened if you sit beside them and suddenly walk off in case you ask them any questions.\" </p> <p>Loach's goal is always to capture what he calls \"authenticity of experience\". In one key scene in which Roisin is confronted by Casim's family for the first time, the director deliberately kept secret from Eva what she was about to see. \"In the first take, the shock actually made her colour up, and tears came to her eyes. If you rehearsed that, you'd never get that. You can't do that to order,\" he says. </p> <p>The director's reputation as a polemicist who shoots in his own gritty, realist style is so ingrained that critics are sometimes oblivious to the humour in his movies and to the delicate way in which he treats relationships. In his work with Laverty, relationships are invariably foregrounded. My Name Is Joe was the tale of a love affair between a recovering drunk (wonderfully played by Peter Mullan) and a middle-class health visitor. The strongest parts of Carla's Song were arguably those dealing with the relationship between Nicaraguan refugee (Oyanka Cabezas) and the Glaswegian bus driver (Robert Carlyle) she meets by chance. In Bread and Roses (which he is currently re-editing), he interweaves the story of the Justice for Janitors campaign with an account of the relationship between Maya (Pilar Padilla), the young Mexican woman recently arrived in LA and the union activist Sam (Adrien Brody). </p> <p>The difference about Ae Fond Kiss is that the love affair is not just an element in a bigger story: it is the central focus. The film features some of the frankest sex scenes in any of Loach's work. The director admits these were hard to film without lapsing into voyeurism or prurience. \"I don't know whether we've succeeded, but we tried to play it straight and not lose the emotional contact between the people, the eye contact. The relationship stays there and they don't just become bodies.\" </p> <p>Still, Loach doesn't want to spend too long discussing the intricacies of shooting sex scenes. It's intriguing how quickly he will steer any given conversation back to politics. During a press conference at the Berlin film festival, after patiently answering questions about whether or not Ae Fond Kiss was optimistic or romantic, he took the opportunity to launch a withering attack on the Labour government's policies toward asylum seekers. Ask him about his recent trip to Japan to accept the \u00a385,000 Praemium Imperiale from the Japanese Royal Family and he'll acknowledge that, yes, it was a little \"surreal\" having an audience with the Japanese emperor and his wife (\"they were very pleasant\"), but he then tells you that he was much more interested in meeting some sacked Japanese railway workers, to whom he donated part of his prize. </p> <p>Ask him about the changes he has witnessed in British film culture over the years, and he advocates a nationalised cinema chain. \"We need cinemas that are programmed by people who enjoy films, not by people who are good at looking after fast food - cinemas which have a wide range of films on show and are not driven by the market. Imagine if you did that in libraries: you'd just have John Grisham and Jeffrey Archer books in public libraries.\" </p> <p>The day before I interviewed Loach, I was in the audience at a special European Film Academy event in Berlin, entitled How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Critics. Speaking on the panel, Loach struck a surprisingly fierce note. He expressed his dismay at \"trivial\" and \"celebrity-driven\" reviewing, and bemoaned critics who \"don't take on board the subject matter you're trying to deal with\", or spend too much of their time comparing films to earlier movies they have seen. \"That's completely stupid and a waste of space and irresponsible and they (the critics) should be knee-capped,\" he said. </p> <p>He went on to argue that big Hollywood movies provided reviewers with the perfect opportunity to become politically engaged. \"You can actually write about American imperialism if you get the chance to review Black Hawk Down,\" he said. \"The films Hollywood make give us a way of speaking about their role in the world.\" </p> <p>Loach, one guesses, will not be happy if critics and audiences choose to regard Ae Fond Kiss as a romantic drama and to ignore the bigger question it poses about class, race and religion. Nor does he much enjoy the reverence in which he is held by his peers. \"You have to remember you're just one person who has contributed to a series of films ... they owe as much to writers like Paul Laverty, Jim Allen and all the other people who've worked on them as to me. We've just been lucky to hit it off on certain occasions - and the director often takes the credit for other people's work.\" </p> <p>Even now, he is not quite sure what his work has achieved. Back in the late 1960s, his famous TV drama Cathy Come Home (about a homeless mother) provoked questions in parliament and led to the founding of homelessness charity, Shelter. His 1990 feature, Hidden Agenda (a film he now dismisses as \"not terribly good\") dealt directly with Britain's shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland. In his work, he has tackled social and political questions head-on. But ask him if he feels his films have made a difference and he strikes a strangely tentative note. \"A film or a television programme can contribute to a climate of opinion,\" he muses. \"That's all you can do: add that one voice to a general discussion about a particular subject.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ae Fond Kiss screens at the Edinburgh film festival on August 22, 23 and 27 and is on general release on September 17.</p>"
