  "More than 60,000 students returned to Leeds this week to discover a vast social experiment which aims to limit their \"takeover\" of scores of streets around the two universities. <p>Four square miles will become an exclusion zone for new student hostels and any further conversions of houses into student flats, if a planning inspector approves a package drawn up by the city council. </p> <p>The initiative is by far the largest attempt of its kind to tackle a growing national problem, caused by unprecedented, government-driven increases in the number of students, with little or no extra funding for housing them. </p> <p>Three areas of Leeds - Headingley, Burley and Hyde Park - have students forming more than half the population, creating lop-sided communities with knock-on effects on facilities such as schools. </p> <p>\"There is no personal animosity against students involved in this,\" said Richard Tyler, a retired academic who has campaigned for eight years to create a more mixed community on the hillsides of largely Victorian terraces overlooking the centre. </p> <p>\"Our problem isn't noise, litter or crime but a very large, very transient part of the population which isn't - hasn't the time to be - interested in the area where it lives.\" </p> <p>The evidence shows all over the wedge-shaped corridor north of the universities, which was described in an academic study five years ago as \"a student Shangri-la\". </p> <p>Buzzing with street life, the three inner suburbs also have miles of unkempt gardens and hedges round houses which fill and empty as the annual procession of tenants hurries through. </p> <p>\"Their life's elsewhere, inevitably,\" said Pauline Elliott, a retired school secretary who was born in Burley and has lived in the same street in Hyde Park for 43 years. \"They have such a huge big club in the shape of the universities, where they work and enjoy themselves. </p> <p>\"We're not fuddy-duddies objecting to young people having fun, but it means there aren't the families, the children, the fantastic community that there used to be.\" </p> <p>The problem has caused similar concern in Birmingham and Nottingham, and two conferences are planned this autumn in London and Leeds to brainstorm possible solutions and flag up the issue to government departments. </p> <p>Leeds has decided to press head with the country's first Ashore - area of student housing restraint - to test whether social engineering can have any effect. </p> <p>\"The big problem has been the market,\" said Dr Tyler, who took the drastic step of buying his neighbour's house seven years ago to let it to non-students as a way of keeping the community mixed. </p> <p>\"Landlords and student parents [who buy houses, let them to their children and friends and sell them on graduation] now outbid all other potential buyers. Perhaps the only weapon against them is this kind of planning restraint.\" </p> <p>Powers to exclude particular groups are highly unusual under planning law. But the exclusion zone has crucial backing in principle from the universities, which accept the virtues of spreading student housing more widely. </p> <p>\"Students bring a great many benefits to Leeds as a whole,\" said a spokeswoman for Leeds University. \"They provide a vibrant, cosmopolitan and multicultured environment. </p> <p>\"They regenerate parts of the city. They have obvious financial benefits. But we accept that some residential areas now have an imbalance between permanent and 'transient' residents, and that this has had detrimental effects.\" </p> <p>The university, along with its counterpart, Leeds Metropolitan, has been part of the consultative process leading to the scheme, although both made objections to details at public hearings last month. </p> <p>In particular, they are pressing for restrictions to cover all houses in multiple occupation, not just students, to avoid discrimination and ill-feeling. </p> <p>Students also accept the need for change, although with caveats that shoddy landlords are a more important target. Tom Wong, communications officer for Leeds University union, said: \"We're broadly supportive of Ashore but students must get a better deal on housing all round. It's about time everyone got together to ask the question: where are all the students going to live? </p> <p>\"The government is driving up the numbers and saying 'Don't worry, we'll organise your education.' But they don't seem to have thought about how we're going to be housed.\" </p> <p>Leeds city council, which changed in June from Labour to a Liberal Democrat/Conservative/Green coalition, has been thinking. </p> <p>Apart from Ashore, its strategy is to create Shangri-las at other points of the compass. Both Unipol, the universities' respected housing agency, and private developers have built or converted clusters of new student-only flats to the west and south of the city centre. </p> <p>These include brightly-coloured, angle-roofed blocks close to the lively central pedestrian precinct and a major site in Holbeck, where dereliction is gradually being turned into Leeds's new cultural quarter for media and arts businesses, plus cafes and clubs. But pioneering south of the River Aire, miles from the legendary Skyrack and Original Oak pubs in Headingley, is still seen as a tall order. </p> <p>\"Would the leader of the council, or lobbyists in Headingley, want their 18-year-old daughter to live in the new Holbeck 'student village', in a potentially dangerous area, with inadequate transport links and poor services? Perhaps not,\" said Tom Wong. </p> <p>Dr Tyler counters: \"The proof of this issue was clear at the Ashore planning inquiry. If students got together they could win all three council seats in Headingley ward. But they were the only interest group which didn't turn up to have their say.\" </p> <p> <b>'It's friendly, it just needs to be more mixed'</b></p> <p>Brian and Pauline Elliott were delighted when their new student neighbours moved in this week. It's been hit or miss over the past 10 years whether there'd be any sense of having real people next door, and this year it seems to be hit. </p> <p>\"We said hope you like it and this lad said, 'Great to be here and if there's ever anything we can do for you, just tell us',\" said Brian. \"That's great.\" </p> <p>But however well things go this year in Brudenell Road, where the Elliott's flower garden contrasts with mattresses dumped in a classic absentee landlord's student house two doors up, it is never going to be like a normal street. The contrast is specially strong for the Elliotts because they grew up here, playing cricket in the alley. </p> <p>\"Jimmy Love that played for Yorkshire was one of us - people always used to say what a straight bat he had and I can tell you why. There were two gardens, one each side, where they'd never give your ball back if you hit it over the fence. So that counted as being out and Jim was brilliant at avoiding them.\" </p> <p>The Elliotts might have moved out 15 years ago, when the big demographic change began, but they're glad they've stayed, and they are enjoying campaigning for a mixed community. </p> <p>\"It's the only thing we need,\" said Brian, whose old primary school, Royal Park, has closed because of a lack of local children. \"It's friendly here, lively and we're near the city centre. It just needs to be more mixed.\"</p>",
  "There are 14 peaks in the world that are more than 8,000 metres high and only one of them, a remote giant in northern Pakistan called Gasherbrum I, was first climbed by Americans; Pete Schoening, who has died aged 77, was one of the pair who reached the summit in 1958. But it was his prompt actions on the nearby, and more famous, peak of K2 that made him a legend in climbing circles, when he averted disaster and saved the lives of his five companions. <p>Schoening really was made of the right stuff. He modestly dismissed notions of heroism but Dee Molenaar, one of those who owed Schoening his life, called him \"a prince of a human being\". </p> <p>In August 1953, the same year that Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Everest, an American expedition of seven climbers was trapped by a storm at more than 25,600ft on the steep slopes of K2, an altogether more imposing mountain. One of the team, Art Gilkey, developed blood clots in his legs. The team knew that if the clots moved to his lungs Gilkey would be dead. </p> <p>In reality, Gilkey was dead already. Performing a rescue at high altitude, on such difficult terrain, is almost impossible even now. \"We thought Art was going to die,\" British team-member Tony Streather recalled. But there was never any question of leaving the stricken man behind. Packing him in his sleeping bag, the team tied a tent around him for protection and started lowering him the thousands of feet back to base camp. </p> <p>After several hundred feet, the climbers encountered a steep slope of ice. Schoening stayed behind with Gilkey, while Molenaar was tied to the other end of Schoening's rope. Then George Bell, who was tied to Streather, suddenly slipped, pulling the British climber off his feet. They then got tangled up with expedition leader Charles Houston and his partner Bob Bates, sweeping Molenaar off with them. </p> <p>All five climbers were brought to a halt by Schoening, who had jammed his ice axe in snow behind a rock and hung on to the rope around his waist. \"When you get into something like mountain climbing,\" he said afterwards, \"I'm sure you do things automatically. It's a mechanical function. You do it when necessary without giving it a thought of how or why.\" </p> <p>The rest of the team felt differently. With all the various climbers hanging from Schoening's rope, it was a miracle no one died. But following the fall, all were shocked, and those who had lost gloves risked frostbite. Houston was unconscious for a while, but came round, and the climbers finally regrouped. </p> <p> When they looked around, Gilkey was gone. His disappearance contributed to the survival of the others, and there has been plenty of speculation that Gilkey, like Captain Oates, sacrificed himself for the good of his friends. Houston, now in his 90s, said recently: \"I think that Art decided it was better to die quickly than sit there alone. He somehow managed to shake himself loose, and sacrificed his life to assure our survival.\" </p> <p>Schoening himself was born in Seattle, a city overlooked by big mountains and home of a vibrant climbing scene, even in the 1940s when the sport was almost unknown in the United States. He dropped out of school to join the navy just before the end of the second world war, and then studied chemical engineering at the Universtiy of Washington. After various jobs, he founded his own fibreglass company, the Chemgrate Corporation, which he sold in 1995 after expanding to operations in Tennessee and China. </p> <p>Apart from his heroics on K2, and that first ascent of Gasherbrum I, Schoening made a number of innovative climbs, including the first ascent, in 1966, of Mount Vinson, the highest peak in Antarctica and the last of the continental high points to be reached. In 1974, he went on the first American expedition to the Pamirs, then part of the Soviet Union. </p> <p>After retiring in 1995, Schoening was free to do more travelling and climbing, and, the following year, despite being 68, he went to Everest with his nephew Klev. Sadly, that year was notorious for its tragedies involving wealthy clients and famous mountain guides, a world away from the modest, but impressive, world Schoening had known. </p> <p>Despite his failure on Everest, he continued to be active, climbing Aconcagua, south America's highest mountain, and Kilimanjaro. Although battling cancer, he was still out in the mountains with friends shortly before his death. </p> <p>When Schoening got back from K2, he married his wife Mell. They shared half a century together, Schoening dying on their 51st wedding anniversary. They had three sons, three daughters and 12 grandchildren. Mell used to joke that if she ever had time to write a book, it would be called Meanwhile, Back At Base Camp. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Peter Schoening, mountaineer, born July 30 1927; died September 22 2004</p>",
  "Near the start of the last century, US Commander Robert Peary claimed he had mastered a seemingly unreachable feat: after 20 years of trying, he had reached the north pole in 38 days - the fastest time anyone had trekked to the top of the Earth. <p>But how was this possible? Surely, at 54, he was too old for the way the arctic ravages the body. He had lost all his toes in previous expeditions and was travelling with a wooden sled. </p> <p>Newspapers and polar historians questioned the authenticity of his claims, and for years the story has been riddled with doubt - in almost 100 years since his attempt, no team has managed to reach the north pole in less than 42 days. </p> <p>British explorer Tom Avery has always believed Peary reached the north pole that day in April 1909. </p> <p>The 28-year-old from Ticehurst, East Sussex, was the youngest Briton to reach the South Pole on foot on December 28 2002, and has spent two years preparing for a journey intended to prove Peary was telling the truth. </p> <p>Having read the historical versions of Peary's journey, Mr Avery says his dream was hatched during long nights in the tent with his fellow arctic travellers on their south pole expedition. </p> <p>\"This is all about trying to solve the greatest mystery in polar exploration, and I feel very passionate about this story now,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>\"When I looked at the north pole it seemed this massive controversy surrounded who was the first to get there, and there was a question about Peary, who was reaching the end of his polar career, and had an unorthodox travel technique. </p> <p>\"It seems to me, that until someone tries to recreate this journey, controversy will always remain.\" </p> <p>Peary started with 23 men, 133 dogs and 19 sleds, but that support team had dwindled to just five companions when he said he reached his ultimate destination. </p> <p>However, just as he announced his feat, a rival US explorer, later exposed as a fraud, claimed he had reached the pole first. The US Congress and the National Geographic Society have since found no reason to doubt Peary's claim. </p> <p>Mr Avery and fellow explorers will begin their journey on March 12, from Resolute Bay in Canada. With him will be South African-born Andrew Gerber, a member of the team which set the record for the fastest team to reach the south pole; US polar explorer Matty McNair; and George Wells, a Suffolk property developer. </p> <p>The Barclays Capital Ultimate North expedition team will be put through a rigorous training regime. This will include dragging tyres through the park in the hope that it will enable them to walk 27 miles a day, despite blizzards and frostbite. </p> <p>They will travel with a team of wolf-like Canadian inuit dogs, just as Peary did, and will follow his route. </p> <p>\"It's the most inhospitable place on Earth. We will be climbing huge ice blocks with dogs and sleds,\" Mr Avery said. \"But this isn't about us trying to break records, it's all about Peary, and to show he did make it.\"</p>",
  "A British Anglican priest has been arrested in Thailand following a request from Australia where he is wanted on paedophile charges, Thai officials said yesterday. <p>John Mountford, 49, an Australian resident, was arrested on Wednesday at his Bangkok home, weeks after returning to the city from Manchester, said an immigration official. </p> <p>He is wanted on eight charges in connection with the alleged abuse of a 14-year-old boy while he was chaplain at St Peter's College, a private school in Adelaide, South Australia, between 1991 and 1992. </p> <p>The charges comprise five counts of indecent assault, one of unlawful sexual intercourse and two of procuring the commission of an act of gross indecency. Australia's justice minister, Chris Ellison, said Canberra would begin extradition proceedings and was confident the request would prove successful. </p> <p>\"This sends a very clear message that those who allegedly breach Australian laws will be tracked down and brought to justice,\" said Mr Ellison. </p> <p>A justice ministry official said Australia had tried to have Mr Mountford arrested in Britain, where he spent some time before returning to Thailand last month. \"We had sought him there, but were unable to locate him,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Mountford, who is being held at a Bangkok prison, was unavailable for comment. In recent weeks at least two other former pupils from the Adelaide school have reportedly come forward alleging that Mr Mountford acted improperly. </p> <p>He fled Australia in 1992, allegedly on the advice of the former Anglican archbishop, Ian George. From 1998 to 2002 he worked at Harrow International School in Bangkok.</p>",

  "Channel Five's House Doctor Ann Maurice may be one of the queens of the property reality TV shows, but she was once a 60s hippie drop-out, caravanning across the US with her two young daughters and raising them as a single mother. <p>To support herself as a traveller she had to live off what she could make herself from the wilds of nature, so she and the young girls bottled and sold jars of homemade strawberry jam. </p> <p>\"We felt just like Little House on the Prairie in our wagon with our jam,\" she laughs. \"But then I had to wake up to the real world and realise I had a responsibility to provide for my children. So I went into selling real estate and it was my introduction to the tough world of money and hard work - I had to start wearing tights and dress normally.\" </p> <p>She was good at the job and over the next 13 years managed to produce a decent standard of living from the commissions. But it was never what she really wanted to do - there was a creative side to her nature that managing home sales could never tap. </p> <p>\"I'm the type of person that needs a new challenge - I don't repeat myself well,\" she says. \"And I kept noticing that we always spent whatever I earned and I didn't feel I was growing personally, which is important to me. </p> <p>\"One day I went to see a psychic, feeling very sceptical, and I remember she looked at me and said 'You're not a real estate agent - it's killing you.' </p> <p>\"By that stage I would sit in an open house we were selling and hope that nobody walked in (when you start feeling that bad you know you need to make a move). The psychic saw me more in design and she was right - two months later I had quit the real estate business and was studying interiors.\" </p> <p>She began with private clients from her property contacts - people that were moving would call her and ask her to make their property look attractive for sale. Then nine years ago, while studying a fresco painting course in Italy, she met an interior designer from London whose daughter worked for the BBC. Impressed to hear about what Ann was doing, she invited her to demonstrate making a house ready for sale on BBC's Home Front. </p> <p>\"Nobody in England had really done that before,\" she says. \"The habit here was simply to put a house straight on the market. They thought the idea of having a 'house doctor' was very novel.\" </p> <p>The TV series began to dominate the direction she was taking and it has now become her entire career (she no longer has private clients). She has concentrated her prospects on the UK market (she has no TV presence in any other country) and runs her business by completing 15 weeks of filming each year and making additional income from her books, interior design courses and product endorsements. </p> <p>\"My income level is back to what it was when I was selling real estate,\" she says, \"but since I don't have to pay for my children any more I've got a little left over that I can invest. Up until two years ago I had been using any spare money to climb the property ladder and I have a house in San Francisco and one in Mexico we bought in stages. </p> <p>\"But although I could carry on investing in property I haven't got the time to find new houses,\" she adds. \"Time is now my most important commodity and I feel that by investing in funds I can forget about them and leave it alone.\" </p> <p>She is certainly wealthier than her parents were - her two homes are worth \u00a32.5m between them. But does having money make her happier? </p> <p>\"In a sense yeah, because when I was raising children all the pressure was on making enough property sales to earn a decent commission,\" she admits. \"But the most important thing in life for me is freedom and being my own boss. </p> <p>\"Success can only follow knowing yourself well - you have to have self-understanding to walk away from something that doesn't suit you and find the thing that does.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> House Doctor is on Five, Fridays, 7.30pm</p>",
  "Denmark hopes to find evidence that the Danish territory of Greenland is connected to a ridge beneath the floating ice of the Arctic Ocean, thus giving Denmark claim to the north pole - and whatever riches in oil and gas may lie beneath it. <p>\"Maybe there is a chance that the north pole could become Danish,\" Helge Sander, the science and technology minister, said yesterday. \"We must be able to argue that it is a natural extension [of Greenland]\", added Trine Dahl-Jensen of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. </p> <p>Greenland, the world's biggest island, is a semi-independent Danish territory whose northern tip is 500 miles south of the pole. </p> <p>Denmark has joined Canada and Russia in charting the Arctic sea bed in an effort to claim ownership of the expanse. </p> <p>The question Danish scientists must resolve is where Greenland's continental shelf ends and the ocean bed begins. Beneath the pole, a 1,250-mile underwater ridge runs between Greenland and Siberia; measurements would have to prove that the Greenland shelf is attached to the Lomonosov ridge. </p> <p>Another factor is a 1986 UN convention that allows countries an economic zone extending 230 miles from their shores. Only countries that have ratified the convention can claim zones; Norway, Russia and Canada have signed, the United States has not. </p> <p>Denmark's parliament is due to ratify it before the end of the year, though an exact date had not been set, Mr Sander said. </p> <p>Since spring, Danish scientists have used sonar, seismographs and GPS data to survey the ridge and have drilled in search of resources. </p> <p>Canada and Russia, which are also likely to claim ownership of the ridge, are making similar investigations.</p>",

  "Up to five tonnes of cocaine seems to have been washed up along the Atlantic beaches of France and Spain, apparently a single shipment dumped overboard by Mexican smugglers. <p>\"Its a serious problem. The street price has fallen by over a third, there's been a big rash of related hospitalisations, and a large number of people who had never even tried cocaine are now hooked,\" said Jean-Michel Delile of the Bordeaux drug research centre. </p> <p>The 1kg bricks are shrink-wrapped and bear a crown logo and the words Calidad Total (Total Quality). They have appeared on the French coast between Arcachon and Biarritz, and Spanish beaches as far west as Bilbao. </p> <p>Since January the French and Spanish police have recovered 1,500kg, tested as 85% pure. \"But what we've seized can only be a small fraction,\" a police spokesman said in Hendaye, a Basque resort on the border. \"We can't put men along every metre of coast.\" </p> <p>Analysis shows the cocaine almost certainly comes from Mexico; it could have been dumped in panic at the approach of a patrol vessel, or lost while being transferred from a freighter in heavy seas. </p> <p>The trove was a temptation, the spokesman said: \"People discovered a previously unsuspected passion for strolling along the beach at midnight.\"</p>",
  "Israeli forces killed at least 23 Palestinians yesterday on one of the bloodiest days of the intifada, as the army made a rare push into the heart of a heavily defended Gaza refugee camp. <p>A single tank shell claimed seven lives, many of them said by witnesses to be unarmed teenagers. But doctors said it was difficult to tell because the bodies were blown apart. </p> <p>More than 100 people were wounded, including children, as Palestinian insurgents put up prolonged resistance to the attack on Jabaliya, a Hamas and Islamic Jihad stronghold. </p> <p>Israel's defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, said he intended to widen the army's assault beyond the camp, just north of Gaza City, after Wednesday's Hamas rocket attack that killed two children, aged two and four, in the Israeli town of Sderot. </p> <p>Ariel Sharon's security cabinet was expected to meet last night to approve a \"large-scale and prolonged operation\" that would include extended reoccupation of parts of the Gaza Strip. Similar military campaigns in the recent past have failed to curb the firing of rockets. </p> <p>Last night another of the crudely produced rockets known as Qassams, made by Hamas, hit an industrial area of Sderot without causing injury. </p> <p>Three Israelis were killed yesterday: two soldiers, and a settler who was out jogging when she was shot by a Palestinian sniper. </p> <p>The army faced considerable resistance from Palestinians firing rockets and automatic weapons as it moved into the centre of Jabaliya for the first time in the four years of intifada, seizing control of a UN school and a high building to post snipers. Most of the dead appeared to be Palestinian fighters, although they also included a 60 year-old man. </p> <p>The shell that killed seven people was fired by a tank next to the school. The army said the tank was responding to a rocket attack. The wounded included 10-year-old Ahmed Salem, who was hit in the leg by shrapnel. </p> <p>\"There was a man next to me who had no head,\" he said. </p> <p>Amid chaotic scenes at the Kamal Adwan hospital, its director, Mahmoud Asali, said more than 100 people were wounded in yesterday's fighting, with many in a critical condition. </p> <p>\"There are some without legs, some without arms, some without eyes. More will die,\" said Dr Asali. </p> <p>While Israeli troops seized control of key buildings in the camp of about 100,000 people, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters continued to move around with relative ease, carrying rocket propelled grenades and shoulder-launched missiles. </p> <p>\"If they think they can conquer Jabaliya they are fools,\" said a masked Hamas fighter who gave his name only as Hassan. \"This will be their grave. They know that. Look at them hiding in the buildings. </p> <p>\"Are we terrorists for resisting when they come and de stroy our homes and kill us? They say it is to stop the Qassams. How many rockets have they fired at our homes?\" </p> <p>It was unclear what the army hoped to achieve by moving into Jabaliya. It is unlikely to be able to prevent more rocket attacks against Sderot. The limited effectiveness of such operations was demonstrated by the army's occupation of another northern Gaza town, Beit Hanoun, for five weeks in July and August, ostensibly to stop rocket attacks. Soldiers killed 20 people, destroyed 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of orange groves and other agricultural land, and demolished 68 homes; but the rockets kept flying. </p> <p>Leaflets were yesterday dropped over northern Gaza by Israeli helicopters, warning Palestinians that \"terrorism pushes you further into a life of misery and poverty\". </p> <p>Palestinians took that to mean that they were all being punished for the rocket attacks, because Mr Sharon feared such attacks could cause an Israeli backlash against his plan to pull all Jewish settlers out of the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Gaza's former security chief, Mohammed Dahlan, who is backed by Britain to play a leading role in the territory after the Israeli withdrawal, said the raid on Jabaliya would \"result in a bloodbath on both sides, because the Palestinian people cannot remain silent in the face of this aggression\". </p> <p>The escalation in Gaza comes in part because Hamas has been able to pack more explosives into its rudimentary Qassams. For nearly four years, the rockets killed no one, but in recent months they have claimed the lives of three children in Sderot and one other Israeli. </p> <p>There is also a determination by both sides to shape interpretations of the Israeli pull out. Hamas is already claiming it as a victory for the insurgency, and wants to bolster its claim that the Israelis are withdrawing under fire. That is the perception that Mr Sharon is determined to avoid as he tries to project the withdrawal as a bold step towards peace.</p>",
  "He is the conservative bastion of the US supreme court, a favourite of President Bush, and a hunting partner of the vice-president. He has argued vociferously against abortion rights, and in favour of anti-sodomy laws. <p>But it turns out that there is another side to Justice Antonin Scalia: he thinks Americans ought to be having more orgies. </p> <p>Challenged about his views on sexual morality, Justice Scalia surprised his audience at Harvard University, telling them: \"I even take the position that sexual orgies eliminate social tensions and ought to be encouraged.\" </p> <p>It seems unlikely that this is what President Bush meant when he promised to appoint more judges like Scalia to the court, should the opportunity arise. Crucially, Justice Scalia is one of the judges in favour of overturning Roe v Wade, the landmark judgment protecting abortion as a constitutional right. </p> <p>One audience member also asked the judge \"whether you have any gay friends, and, if not, whether you'd like to be my friend,\" the Harvard Crimson newspaper reported. </p> <p>\"I probably do have some gay friends, but I have never pressed the point,\" Justice Scalia responded. He offered no clue to the logic behind his claim that orgies eliminate social tensions. </p> <p>Nobody asked him whether he was familiar with Rick Moody's novel The Ice Storm, turned into a movie by Ang Lee, which appeared to suggest the exact opposite.</p>",
  "<p>Top of the Pops audience members are nothing if not versatile. Five minutes ago, on the last Friday evening in September, they were directing their considerable enthusiasm towards the gym-clad dancers representing Eric Prydz's Call on Me: picture a Jane Fonda workout video reimagined by the staff of Razzle. Now they whoop just as enthusiastically as three thirtysomething men in black perform a song called The Love of Richard Nixon. They clap along as the screen above the Manic Street Preachers' heads shows bombs raining down on Vietnam. Two teenage girls dance together while James Dean Bradfield sings the line: \"People forget China and your war on cancer.\" Of such gratifyingly surreal pop moments is the Manic Street Preachers' career made.</p> <p>\"To release that as a single obviously gives us a bit of glee,\" says bassist and lyricist Nicky Wire. \"I'm attracted by egotistical, megalomaniac, paranoid people. There's a sample on the record where Nixon says, 'I have never been a quitter.' I feel a bit of empathy with that. It's the idea of the ugly duckling. Radiohead are Kennedy, Manic Street Preachers are Nixon.\" He laughs, unfurling his mile-wide grin.</p> <p>Wire is obsessed with history - both the political variety, and that of his own band. His lyrics reveal as much, whether defiant (Masses Against the Classes: \"We're tired of giving a reason why we're the only thing left to believe in\"), or defeated (The Everlasting: \"In the beginning, when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine\").</p> <p>It is the curse of the Manics that they will always be held up against their younger, thinner, more fearless selves. Four working-class intellectuals plotted the perfect band in their bedrooms in Blackwood, Gwent, and launched it, in a blaze of spray-paint, mascara and outrage, with the precision of a military campaign.</p> <p>Then, on February 1 1995, Richey Edwards, their chief lyricist and strategist, left his London hotel and never came back. His still unsolved disappearance is the central tragedy of the Manics' career, and it casts a shadow over every Brit award they've won, every arena they've filled. \"We are haunted by ghosts,\" says Wire. \"We're haunted by the way we looked - the symmetry - the four of us - everything was perfect.\"</p> <p>It's two days before Top of the Pops and the Manics are rehearsing in a studio in an insalubrious corner of central Cardiff. While working late at night, says Bradfield, he has spotted prostitutes plying their trade outside. \"We work better when it's grim,\" says Wire. On the sofa, gnomic drummer Sean Moore is tapping away at a wireless laptop. \"He gets everything in the world before anyone else,\" Wire says admiringly. \"He could have been the Welsh Bill Gates.\" Famously averse to interviews, Moore's off the hook today. \"There's no point,\" he says cheerfully. \"I always say the same thing.\"</p> <p>They run through five songs from their seventh album, Lifeblood. The record's guiding principle was \"elegiac pop\", and the mood is uptempo melancholy: sleek and sad.</p> <p>\"I don't mind if people think this album is quite coffee-table,\" says Wire, folding his 6ft 3in frame on to the upstairs sofa. \"I see that as a compliment. I think White Flag by Dido is a brilliant record.\"</p> <p>Such sentiments sound odd coming from the man so hostile to consensus opinion that he once told a New York audience that the only good thing about their city was that it killed John Lennon, and declared, on stage at Glastonbury in 1994, that someone should \"build a bypass over this shithole\". (\"That's not rational, well-thought-out behaviour,\" he concedes now.) The last time the Manics were palatable to the mainstream, with 1998's This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, they responded with the messy, contorted Know Your Enemy, an internal psychodrama set to music. \"I think at the end of This Is My Truth we went off ourselves a bit,\" says Wire. \"You know when your favourite band gets liked by someone you really hate? Well the Manic Street Preachers were always my favourite band.\"</p> <p>Whatever Know Your Enemy was designed to achieve - it certainly solved the problem of fair-weather fans - Lifeblood is quite the opposite. The quotation on the sleeve is from Descartes: \"Conquer yourself, not the world.\" \"That's where we are now,\" says Wire. \"Twelve years ago we'd have said, conquer the world and fuck yourself.\"</p> <p>The Manics have always been a band apart. At the height of baggy and shoegazing, they presented a bold, if somewhat cackhanded, collision of Guy Debord and Guns N' Roses. In the year of Parklife and Definitely Maybe, they released an apocalyptically extreme screed called The Holy Bible. So, now that even mild-mannered Travis have discovered protest, it is characteristic that the Manics have recorded their least political album yet.</p> <p>\"I didn't feel under any pressure to talk about Iraq,\" says Wire, who has never worn his politics degree lightly. \"It's a fucking relief, to be honest. Nobody agrees with anything I say anyway.\"</p> <p>Are you driven to go against the mainstream at any cost? \"There's a fatal flaw in us all when it comes to toeing a certain line. I admire Bono, deep down. I'd love to do what he did but I could never be that nice.\" The word hisses out of him. Diplomacy is not his forte. \"If you're an American president you're a cunt. It makes no difference. Bill Clinton is a lovely guy. He has cigars with Bono and Kofi Annan. Does anyone remember Rwanda? Perhaps George Bush would have intervened.\"</p> <p>Nicky Wire's favourite words are future, beautiful and forever, and he now tries to strike them from his lyrics. He likes hotels, sports, TV, reading (poetry, history), writing his potential book (\"It might read like one idiot's rant against everything, but there's room for that\"), the new shed in his Newport garden, and being alone. How many people does he need in his life? He counts them off on his fingers. \"About seven. My wife, my daughter [two-year-old Clara], my mum and dad, brother [playwright Patrick Jones], James, Sean, Martin [Hall, their manager].\"</p> <p>Does he actually like people? \"Most people, when you make the effort to meet them, are a lot nicer than you think.\" He laughs, slightly sadly. \"I never get the impression they think that about me.\" We talk about the television show Curb Your Enthusiasm, which he loves. \"All the comedy I like is imbued with failure, whether it's Basil Fawlty or Larry Sanders. James likes stuff like Cheers.\"</p> <p>During the second half of the 1990s, James Dean Bradfield lived a Cheers-like existence in London: as sociable as his bandmates were remote, he would be out drinking most nights. Back then, Wire and Moore joked about living vicariously through their singer. \"It finished about three years ago,\" says Bradfield, sitting amid amps and instruments in the studio, his fingers rarely without a lit cigarette. \"Even prior to that, if they were living through me, all they'd have got was a bottle of Cutty Sark, some Jameson's, Coca-Cola, ice, cigarettes and pissing on about the same old things at the bar. I think they saw me as being a bit daft.\" Did you feel daft? \"Eventually, yeah.\"</p> <p>The change is due partly to his love life (he is newly married), and partly to a delayed reaction to his mother's death from cancer in 2000. At first, he just drank harder. \"If you were brought up like I was, you try to show you're not scared of it. So you don't turn to tofu or meditation, you just think, fuck you, I won't change a thing.\"</p> <p>It's unusual to see Bradfield so at ease with himself: he no longer screws up his face and fidgets with his lighter while answering questions. He feels happier about the band, too. Tony Visconti, who produced some of Lifeblood, taught them to trust themselves again, instead of second-guessing every move. \"I've let go of people expecting things from us,\" says Bradfield. \"Some people want you to be a cartoon version of yourself forever, and if you can't be that then you've got to split up.\" But the Manics' invigoratingly exact original manifesto was never destined to survive intact. \"At least we broke our own rules,\" Bradfield says. \"They were the most ludicrous rules that there was no way we could ever hold true to them.\"</p> <p>One self-imposed law forbade licensing a song to an advert. Recently, they broke it by allowing the song Australia to promote the Australian tourist board, which Bradfield confesses was \"a knee-jerk revenge\" after years of people criticising their every move. He also regards their much-ballyhooed trip to Cuba in 2001 as \"a failure\", admitting they were naive not to expect a backlash.</p> <p>But Bradfield will not apologise for what some still regard as the Manics' cardinal sin: not breaking up after Edwards vanished. \"Why can't people accept that there was a massive loyalty between us?,\" he says forcefully. \"You know, we weren't left with a goodbye card or a set of instructions.\"</p> <p>Two years ago, the Daily Star reported that a pair of trainers containing bones, possibly those of Edwards, had been discovered in the Severn. \"I think it hurts us a million times more than we would ever let on and even realise ourselves,\" says Wire. Bradfield is more emphatic about the Star's failure to forewarn Edwards' parents: \"Cunts. Fucking cunts.\"</p> <p>This was around the seventh anniversary of the disappearance, when Edwards' family declined to have him officially declared dead. Some commentators reacted with a distasteful mix of voyeurism and gleeful impatience. \"You get that a lot if you're jumping in a cab round here,\" says Wire. \"They say, 'How's that boy of yours, then? You know where he is, don't you?' It's the blankness that you have to deal with. Cardiff Afterlife deals with the feeling of being kept dangling. There's not a body, there's not a grave, but there's hope. You know in Superman, when the baddies expel people from Krypton and they're in bubbles, just floating around? It's felt like that sometimes.\"</p> <p>Bradfield can't stand what he calls \"the B-movie questions\". \"They want him to be stood in front of a TV shop window, with a beard, watching us on TV, saying, 'Good on ya, boys'. Then he walks away back to his fishmonger's job. End of film.\"</p> <p>None the less, he acknowledges that producing a 10th anniversary edition of The Holy Bible, their last record with Edwards, has raised some painful questions. \"Were there things we could have done differently?\" he asks, his brow creasing. \"Definitely. But we were taking all the decisions together at the time. And we were young. It's a cliche but, God, I wish I knew what I know now. I think closure's for people who want to wash their hands of the guilt they feel.\"</p> <p>At the start, the Manics believed fervently in the idea of The Band: an entity that transcended its individual parts. Even with one of those parts missing, they still do. \"Radiohead and Blur and Oasis are a group of individuals,\" says Bradfield. \"Even to Middle England, Thom Yorke is recognisable. But I've heard so many times, 'There's that bloke from the Manic Street Preachers.' I never wanted to be anything else but the bloke from the Manic Street Preachers.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Love of Richard Nixon is out on Epic on October 18.

  "We have all seen bad films; fortunately most of them are quickly forgotten. However, I'm going to find it difficult to erase the latest from my mind: was it mystery, comedy or action? I wish to God I knew. The drama I found myself in last week was like some horrible Hollywood B-movie. And I was the star. But nobody ever told me the plot, let alone the lines. <p>\"Wait a minute!\" I thought, as I sat in front of three FBI agents in the US immigration office, \"Am I supposed to be the baddie?\" </p> <p>The Boeing 747 carrying me and my 21-year-old daughter, with more than 200 other passengers, had been ordered to make an emergency stop in a ghost-like airport called Bangor. It seemed a terrible mistake. My ticket said Washington. The FBI men kept asking me to spell my name. \"Y-U-S-U-F,\" I patiently repeated. They looked puzzled. \"Are you sure that's the only way you spell it?\" </p> <p>My daughter and I were separated for over an hour for questioning. The officers treated us well, but there was an unbearable uncertainty echoing round my mind: Why? Nobody could answer that question. At least in the past I could see my Moonshadow; now I was dealing with a ghost within a database system, untraceable and indiscriminate. </p> <p>I had been on my way to Nashville to explore some new musical ideas with a record label there. It was meant to be low-profile because of speculation that it might have raised in the music world about a return of \"the Cat\" - media attention was the last thing I wanted. But it seems God wanted it otherwise. </p> <p>Whether there was a mix-up of names and identities, I still don't know. There was no obligation for them to give me a reason; the green visa waiver form I had so neatly filled in denied me any right to appeal or demand answers. </p> <p>The worst thing was to be separated from my daughter, not knowing how she was or when we might be reunited. She was finally permitted to travel on to Washington with the luggage. Since my phone was confiscated, I couldn't contact her for the next 33 hours, neither could I ring my family, who were relegated to watching the whole frightening episode on TV. </p> <p>I was driven over 200 miles to Boston, changing vehicles three times. It was only while I was watching TV in a confined hotel room at Boston's Logan airport, that I realised the gross slanders and allegations being spoken against me. </p> <p>The amazing thing is that I was not given (and have still not been given) any explanation of what it is I am accused of, let alone an opportunity to respond to these allegations. I was simply told that the order had come from \"on high\". On the planet I come from, I've never known a court where you don't know what crime was committed; you don't hear evidence; and you don't even see a jury or judge. </p> <p>Finally, the curtain dropped down and the lights came up; I was relieved of my ordeal and delivered home to my family. Never would I have believed that such a thing could happen in the \"land of the free\". </p> <p>The consternation of Muslims living in the west is clearly justified: Islamophobia is not a theory, it's a fact, and many ordinary Muslims in the UK and elsewhere are suffering, unseen and unheard. Was I just another victim of religious profiling? </p> <p>Big questions remain. Was it a mistake? Was it because, after embracing Islam in 1977, I considered the majority under-privileged dark-skinned people of the so-called third world brothers and sisters in humanity, and the fact that I have sympathy for the neglected people of the world who are suffering from tyranny, poverty or war? Was it because I walked out of the wild world of the music industry? Why? </p> <p>I am a man of peace and denounce all forms of terrorism and injustice; it is outrageous for the US authorities to suggest otherwise. I have dedicated my life to promoting peace throughout the world. It would be devastating were the charity work I do through my humanitarian relief organisation, Small Kindness, which helps countless children and families, and my work for education, to be undermined by what has happened. </p> <p>I can think of no better response than to continue the important work of caring for the needy and campaigning for peace and stability in this volatile and violent world, and at the same time try to seek to clear my name of this appalling and baseless slur against my character. </p> <p>In the meantime I am confident that, in the end, common sense and justice will prevail. I'm an optimist, brought up on the belief that if you wait to the end of the story, you get to see the good people live happily ever after. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Yusuf Islam is chairman of the lslamia Schools Trust and the Small Kindness Trust; he was formerly known as Cat Stevens </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:enquiries@yusufislam.org.uk\">enquiries@yusufislam.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<b> Frank J Gaffney Jr</b> Washington Times, September 28 <br> <p>\"Suddenly, the hottest phenomenon in presidential politics is the metamorphosis of women from 'soccer moms' to 'security moms'. If this group is as much in play as some polls suggest, then working and other mothers who are concerned first and foremost with their children's security may well prove to be president-makers in 2004 ... </p> <p>\"A significant number of security moms and other women ... appear to have concluded that President George Bush has proven a competent steward of national security in the wake of September 11. This explains, in part, John Kerry's determined effort to savage his record.\" </p> <p><b> Cathy Young</b> Boston Globe, September 27 <br> </p> <p>\"Republicans often stress (rightly) that national security ... is not a 'men's issue' or a 'women's issue'. Yet it is still being packaged in gender-specific ways designed to appeal to women ... </p> <p>\"Smartly, Republican rhetoric appeals to the traditional archetype of the strong, decisive man making the women feel safe and protected without lapsing into overly patriarchal stereotypes. Mr Bush's entourage includes strong women like Condoleezza Rice. </p> <p>\"Is the Republican strategy to appeal to women and their safety concerns emotionally manipulative? Sure it is. Does it avoid the tough, timely questions about whether Mr Bush's policies in Iraq have really made it a safer world for Americans? Yes. But so far, the strategy seems to be working.\" </p> <p><b> Margaret Carlson</b> Los Angeles Times, September 30 <br> </p> <p>\"Though errant female voters are gettable for Mr Kerry, it won't be easy.

Marrying a second one looks like a calculated career move ... At a totally superficial level, that orange tan is troublesome. Across the political spectrum, women do not trust a primper ... </p> <p>\"Both sides have tried to show off for security moms. Mr Bush, of course, flew on to the carrier deck in full flyboy regalia. Mr Kerry arrived on Jay Leno's set gunning his Harley. He invites reporters to watch him play bodyslam ice hockey and take pictures as he shoots pheasant. But none of that could make up for failing to respond when the Swift boat veterans took aim at the heart of his claim to be strong enough to be commander in chief, and his standing among women suffered for it.\" </p> <p><b> Collin Levey </b> New York Post, September 30<br> </p> <p> \"A central conceit of political feminists has been that women should have all the freedom of men, except for the freedom to hold diverse political opinions. Not that attempts to corral women into political lock step have ever worked that well. Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter for the women's vote 45% to 44%. Next time out, he got 56% of the female vote ... </p> <p>\"On the big issues (security, economy), women turn out not to be so different from men. You'd think women's groups would be proud of the fact that women are wrestling with these matters and coming to their own, independent judgments. Why should non-gender-related topics adhere to a 'gender gap' anyway? But, of course, that ends up leaving the women's groups feeling kind of useless, doesn't it?\" </p> <p><b> Kathleen Parker</b> Orlando Sentinel, September 26 <br> </p> <p>\"Mr Bush and Mr Kerry are right to court the ladies, but adapting the message to the moment isn't likely to make the difference that counts ...

Mothers, whose offspring confirm prior experience with some sweet-talkin' dude, know that score by heart.

Actually, the gap is as yawning as ever. Mr Bush still leads Mr Kerry among white men by double digits ... </p> <p>\"The race between the two parties has always been about which could deal with its gender problem first. The prominence of terrorism has given the [Republicans] an opening ... Of course, other factors are influencing women's views of the candidates besides terror, and Mr Kerry is underperforming among everyone at the moment.

  "<p>The Everyman could wish for no finer 40th anniversary present than a return to form. The space aches for the epic, wildly ambitious, topically contentious plays for which it became famous in the 1970s; without them, it has been starved of its essential oxygen. Tony Green's drama re-establishes the supply with such vehemence that it causes a bit of a headrush. </p> <p>There has been such a dearth of these vast, scouse social panoramas of late that Green seems determined to make up the shortfall by writing what seems to be at least five plays all at once. The Kindness of Strangers is an asylum seeker's tale, a state-of-the-nation piece, a gay coming-out drama and an agoraphobic's staying-in one. He then spices things up with music, cabaret turns and a walk-on part for a couple of goats. </p> <p>Green sets in train a bewildering number of storylines: Mohammed (a puppyishly adorable performance from Adam Levy) is a Kurdish refugee, Macey (Lorraine Burroughs in an outstanding professional debut) a struggling single-mum prostitute, and Jimmy (Neal Barry) a cockney cafe owner who facilitates their marriage as a business agreement. </p> <p>That would be more than enough to be going on with, but Green stirs into the mix the parallel tale of Cheryl, a young Irish woman terrified of open spaces, and Sam, an unscrupulous landlord resolved to reacquaint her with them.

  "Some 200 Israeli tanks and bulldozers massed on the border with the Gaza Strip today after Israel's cabinet last night approved a new offensive following yesterday's heavy fighting. <p>Troops were setting up makeshift camps, apparently in preparation for an extended large-scale military operation, codenamed \"Days of Penitence\" aimed at stopping Palestinian rocket fire.</p> <p>Two Israeli rocket strikes killed five Palestinians and wounded 17 others in the Jebaliya refugee camp, the Palestinians' largest and most densely populated camp.</p> <p>Jebaliya was the main scene of fighting yesterday that left 28 Palestinians dead and 139 wounded - which was the highest single day of Palestinian fatalities in 30 months of fighting. </p> <p>The Palestinian cabinet minister, Saeb Erekat, denounced the Israeli raid as \"a war crime and state terror\", and said he feared all of Gaza would soon be reoccupied. </p> <p>Today the Israeli army said troops fired at one group of militants planting explosives and another setting up a rocket launcher. </p> <p>Palestinian militants have fired hundreds of rockets and mortar shells at Gaza settlements and Israeli border towns since 2000. Most attacks caused damage and minor injuries. </p> <p>There have been two deadly strikes, including Wednesday's hit on the border town of Sderot that killed two children as they played on the sidewalk in a quiet neighbourhood at the onset of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.</p> <p>The Israeli defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, ordered troops to \"exact a price\" from the militants, security officials said, after the Hamas rocket killed the two children, aged two and four. </p> <p>Hundreds of troops, backed by tanks and helicopters, have already been operating in northern Gaza since Wednesday, but many more soldiers were expected to move into the strip in the coming hours. </p> <p>Despite the heavy troop presence and reports by military officials that they have commandeered a five mile strip of Gaza that should keep Israeli towns out of rocket range, Palestinian militants fired a rocket this afternoon at the town of Sderot. </p> <p>The rocket landed in an open area and no Israelis were injured, but it underscored a point made by Israeli cabinet ministers and military experts that the army cannot completely stop the rocket fire. </p> <p>Israeli officials said the current operations would be open-ended. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, told the security cabinet that he was determined to stop the rocket fire, but stopped short of calling up reserves. </p> <p>\"What can we do?\" a participant quoted Mr Sharon as saying. \"The Jews, too, have a right to live.\" </p> <p>In addition to the two children, three Israelis were killed in Gaza yesterday, two soldiers and a woman settler. </p> <p>Militants have been stepping up attacks on Israelis in recent months, in hopes of portraying Israel's planned withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 as a retreat under fire. The Israeli army has been pounding the militants in intensifying strikes, to deny them such claims. </p> <p>After a relatively quiet night, Palestinian gunmen were taking up positions in Jebaliya alleys. </p> <p>Nizar Rayan, the top Hamas leader in northern Gaza, encouraged the gunmen and gave them tips in a message broadcast in mosques and on a local radio station last night. </p> <p>Mr Rayan said gunmen should not remain in one place for more than three minutes, to avoid being spotted, and talk on their cellphones only when absolutely necessary. The militants, who were moving in small groups of no more than seven, communicated largely through SMS messages. </p> <p>Militants followed one of Rayan's advice immediately - to reduce visibility by burning tires and filling the air with black smoke, thus making it harder for Israeli unmanned aircraft, or drones, to spot them. </p> <p>Hospital officials, meanwhile, said seven Palestinians killed yesterday by an Israeli tank shell were boys between the ages of 13 and 17. </p> <p>The army had said the tank fired the shell at a group of gunmen near Jebaliya's market, after they threw explosives at an armoured vehicle. </p> <p>Twenty-three Palestinians were wounded by the tank shell, including many who lost limbs, and at least four of the wounded were under the age of 14, doctors said. </p>",

  "Labour last night breathed a sigh of relief when it held on to the safe seat of Hartlepool in a byelection that had at one point been billed as a chance to trigger the resignation of Tony Blair before the general election. <p>In one of the most bitterly fought contests of recent times, Labour won with a vote of 12,752, a majority of 2,033, down from 14,571 in the 2001 general election. </p> <p>Turnout was just under 46%, down about 10 percentage points from the general election but in line with many recent byelections. </p> <p>The Tories tumbled from second place to a catastrophic fourth, behind the UK Independence party. This is the first time since the second world war that the official opposition has come fourth in a byelection. The Tories polled 3,044, 149 fewer than the Ukip. </p> <p>The swing to the Liberal Democrats was 18%, only two points less than the swing which they secured to win the Leicester South byelection in July. The Liberal Democrats had hoped the barrister Jody Dunn could beat the Labour local councillor Iain Wright. But they could not break down Labour strongholds, partly because local issues dominated, rather than the running sore of Iraq and the prime minister's trustworthiness. </p> <p>Mr Wright said in a combative acceptance: \"This is great news for Tony Blair, a huge disappointment for Charles Kennedy and absolute disaster for Michael Howard. It is absolutely clear that he cannot win a byelection.\" </p> <p>Lord Rennard, the Liberal Democrat campaign chief said: \"The question is not why we lost, but why we came so close. This has been a solid Labour town for 40 years. We are now seeing a pattern in which the Tories start in second place and end up third, and now fourth\". </p> <p>Ms Dunn was prevented from making a speech after the count when the Fathers for Justice candidate Paul Watson threw purple powder over her. A man was later arrested. </p> <p>The result is the worst possible curtain raiser for the Conservative conference next week in Bournemouth. </p> <p>David Willetts, the shadow welfare secretary, frankly admitted that the result was a blow. \"It is very frustrating for us that we are not doing better at picking up votes of people disappointed with Labour.\" </p> <p>He urged the party \"not to go down the self indulgent route of changing its leader\". </p> <p>Mr Howard will face more calls to go further right by promising tax cuts and an even stronger line on Europe and asylum. In his defence, the recent byelections have not been in natural Tory territory. </p> <p>Labour will see the result as a vindication of its decision to plump for a local man and to mount an aggressive campaign against the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>The byelection was caused by the decision of Peter Mandelson the former cabinet minister to take up the post of European commissioner.</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday October 7 2004</b> <p>We say in the article below that the EU has taken command of the Nato-led peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Afghanistan. While this is true for Bosnia, the Eurocorps headquarters - which recently took charge in Afghanistan - reports to Nato, although it is available both to the EU and Nato.</p> <p></p> <p>The European Union's fledgling effort to develop its own military force is slowly taking shape on the dusty streets of the Afghan capital. But in the mounting insecurity which plagues the country as presidential elections approach next week, it is unlikely that many Afghans have noticed. </p> <p>So is it a case of great things having humble beginnings, or that nothing has really changed since August, when the five-nation Eurocorps, led by France and Germany, replaced Nato in commanding the international United Nations-mandated contingents who patrol Kabul? </p> <p>Tall, heavily-armed white men in flak jackets, tramping past crowded bazaars or rumbling in armoured cars through the heaving traffic of painted lorries and ancient taxis - who spots the difference between the EU and Nato? </p> <p>By the end of the year the EU will also have replaced Nato in charge of peace-keeping in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The same riddle of recognition will apply there, too, even though these two missions are touted as the most significant steps yet taken to put teeth into Europe's security and defence policy. In fact, they are both postwar, peacekeeping operations on a very classic model. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the EU's military activity has been more innovative, at least in terms of the mission's purpose. The EU went briefly into Macedonia to forestall a civil war at the initiative of the two main ethnic communities' leaders. Last year, with a UN mandate, it protected civilians and put an end to massacres and rape in the eastern Congolese region of Ituri. </p> <p>There was nothing here about regime change or mopping up after war. The troops were there to protect civilians and prevent disaster, or in the Congolese case, to put a stop to it. The EU has also organised two police missions to help local law-enforcement in the Balkans, and one in Georgia. </p> <p>The EU recently set up a command centre to plan European military-civil operations. In recognition that police are a key component of postwar nation building and conflict prevention, there is talk of creating a European gendarmerie. </p> <p>Yet, as the EU builds up a capability for military action, questions remain over the doctrine which its forces will follow. Are they simply pooling units from national armies under a joint EU command? Is it a mini-Nato with a European face, the much-vaunted European \"pillar\" of Nato, finally standing erect? Is the new force to have a different or just a separate approach from the Americans? </p> <p>At their Brussels summit last year EU governments agreed on a security strategy which went far beyond the issue of Europe. In contradiction to the appalling idea of Europe authorising asylum seekers' detention camps in north Africa, which European home affairs ministers are discussing again this week, it recognised that fortress Europe is unworkable and immoral. \"The post cold war environment is one of increasingly open borders in which the internal and external aspects of security are indissolubly linked,\" the strategy document says. </p> <p>Implicitly rejecting the Bush concept of military pre-emption, it calls for \"preventive engagement\", by which it means European action to help countries return to democracy, or build it, before military threats arise. </p> <p>How this can be done systematically is fleshed out in an important and imaginative new report, A Human Security Doctrine for Europe. Set up by Javier Solana, the European foreign minister, whose job was created under the new European constitution, the report's drafting committee was convened by Professor Mary Kaldor of the London School of Economics. </p> <p>The report avoids the issue of the EU's relationship with Nato, and whether EU security activities should complement or substitute for Nato. Nor does it get into the self-flattering debate about the United States as Mars and Europe as Venus. It points out that Europe's posture is just as Martian and outmoded as that of the United States. \"Europe has 1.8 million people under arms, but only a fraction can be deployed in crisis zones. Europe needs to be able to deploy more police, human rights monitors, aid specialists, and many other kinds of civilian expertise,\" it says. </p> <p>The report's core is a set of principles to guide EU military-civil missions. The first is the primacy of human rights. It is not enough that an intervention be legal. The methods adopted must be appropriate since protection of civilians is an end in itself. Under the doctrine, for Europe to adopt tactics like the current US airstrikes on Iraqi cities would be wrong and counterproductive since excessive use of force inflames a situation. </p> <p>More radically, the report calls for a bottom-up approach. Decisions about whether and how to intervene must take account of the views of the people affected by violence and insecurity. Once established on the ground, missions have to provide for consultation, dialogue, and partnership with local people. \"International interventions can never be more than enabling. There is a tendency among internationals to assume they know best. Conventional attitudes have too often been to do it for them or to work with weak or criminalised leaders,\" the report says. </p> <p>In a similar spirit, the report says that if the EU is going to act as a \"norms-promoter\" abroad, it has to conform to clear legal standards itself. There should be common rules of engagement for EU troops, and all deployed personnel should be subject to enforceable sexual codes of conduct, as well as the domestic law of the host state. The scandal of prostitution and child abuse, exacerbated by claims of immunity or blind-eye-turning by mission leaders, has tarnished too many international operations, whether run by the UN or Nato. </p> <p>The report calls for a \"human security response force\" of 15,000 people, of whom a third would be police and civilian specialists. Around 5,000 should be ready to deploy within days. There would be a civil-military crisis management centre in Brussels to provide early warning by keeping in touch with NGOs and monitors on the ground. </p> <p>These proposals offer a genuine alternative, which go a long way towards solving the spot-the-difference riddle. Whether the report is acted on will largely depend on Javier Solana, its sponsor. He is already recruiting staff for what will be one of the commission's largest departments. </p> <p>Giving direction to this giant bureaucracy will require strong determination and a willingness to change the ethos of the top-down Nato and United Nations interventions of the past. Far more than the conventional goals of improving airlift capacity or ensuring national weapon-systems are inter-operable, Europe needs brain and sensitivity if it is to be respected as a new global player. </p> <p> Javier Solana's report is on <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global  \">www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The architect who won the competition to rebuild on New York's Ground Zero has revealed how the process degenerated into bitter feuds and childish squabbles among rival designers - though he rejects the notion that the new plan for the site is an uninspiring compromise. <p>In a candid new book, Breaking Ground, Daniel Libeskind recounts what he calls his \"forced marriage\" to David Childs, the favoured architect of the World Trade Centre site's developer, Larry Silverstein. </p> <p>He portrays Mr Childs as patronising and overbearing, and intent on eliminating as much of Mr Libeskind's vision as possible from the eventual design. Relations between the two architectural practices were so fraught that they \"recalled the orchestrated arrangements between North and South Korea at the very tense border at Panmunjom\". </p> <p>Since winning the competition last year, Mr Libeskind, designer of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, has been fighting to preserve what he can of his original concept, which had as its centrepiece a Freedom Tower, 1,776 feet high, to represent the date of the American declaration of independence. That symbolic height has been maintained, and the tower's cornerstone was laid in July. </p> <p>But much of the rest of the design has been heavily modified to meet Mr Silverstein's \"uncompromising demands for yet more office space without regard for the public plazas, parks, memorials and streets of the master plan\", as Mr Libeskind puts it. </p> <p>Mr Childs's company, Skidmore Owings and Merrill (SOM), was hired directly by the developer - who told reporters he had an \"absolute right to choose the architects\" - while Mr Libeskind won the prize from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. </p> <p>The consequent working relationship, Mr Libeskind writes, was often \"downright nuts\". He claims that no representative from his company was allowed to enter SOM's offices unless someone of equivalent seniority was present, and that for the majority of the time during their weekly meetings, Mr Childs would \"chatter on about where he'd just been or would lecture me on architecture\". </p> <p>\"He gave me the patronising look reserved for the village idiot,\" he notes on another occasion, describing it as \"weird to inhabit David Childs's universe, where everybody knew his or her prescribed place ... Childs wasn't interested in what we were working on; he was proceeding with plans for the building he had proposed to Larry Silverstein many months before.\" </p> <p>The process was only kept on track at all, he says, because of the forceful intervention of George Pataki, the governor of New York state. </p> <p>The collaboration was undoubtedly a clash of cultures between the black-suited European architect, poetic and sometimes baffling in his pronouncements about the site, and the no-nonsense American commercial designer. </p> <p>Elizabeth Kubany, from Mr Childs's company, said Mr Libeskind's account was highly partisan. \"We're not going to respond to it point by point,\" she said. \"Certainly there are many things in it that are half true. We have a building that we're trying to build, so all of this time spent talking about the process seems counterproductive to us.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Silverstein called the plans for the site \"spectacular\", adding: \"We regret that Daniel Libeskind feels the need to attack so many of the participants in that effort.\" </p> <p>Mr Libeskind seemed more conciliatory yesterday. \"I compromised here and I negotiated there ... but I believe in [the project],\" he told the Associated Press news agency. \"You have to be flexible. You have to be able to accommodate future needs. At the same time, you have to create a plan that has integrity and strength and that can withstand all these changes. I think when it's built, people will forget the squabbles.\" </p> <p>That perspective is far from unanimously shared among design experts. \"It's like that old cliche about a camel being a horse designed by a committee,\" said Paul Goldberger, the New Yorker magazine's architectural critic. \"We now have the camel of skyscrapers. Do you ask Matisse and Dal\u00ed to collaborate on painting a picture together? No.\"</p>",
  "Recent reports that North Korea is trying to reduce the presence of foreign aid agencies in Pyongyang have highlighted the growing pressure on the isolated regime to open up. <p>The pressure comes from two directions - inside-out and outside-in - that have come to reflect the differences between radical and cautious proponents of change. </p> <p>Hawkish inside-outers, who include US neo-conservatives and South Korean Christians, want to bring down the \"great leader\", Kim Jong-il, as quickly as possible. Their preferred method is to \"squeeze\" North Korea in order to encourage a mass exodus of refugees similar to that which led to the fall of the Berlin wall. </p> <p>Their recent successes have included the passage of a new bill through the US congress, aiming to provide financial support for refugees, and the growing number of North Korean asylum seekers flooding into embassies, consulates and international schools in China. </p> <p>Dovish outside-inners, on the other hand, fear that a sudden destabilisation will lead to starvation, war and economic chaos in north-east Asia.</p> <p>The approach favoured by this side, which includes international aid institutions and most governments in the region, is to slowly \"dissolve\" North Korea's most rigid institutions through a gradual opening up that allows the country to blend in better with the outside world. </p> <p>This camp has also made impressive gains in recent years. The number of South Koreans visiting the North has surged from several hundred to tens of thousands, several dozennon-governmental organisations (NGOs) have opened offices in Pyongyang, and the World Food Programme now feeds around one fifth of the North's 22 milllion population. </p> <p>The North Korean government has always condemned the former while grudgingly tolerating the latter. In recent weeks, however, there have been signs that Pyongyang is beginning to view even the more sympathetic outside-in camp as a threat. </p> <p>Last month, the North unilaterally announced that it would not take part in the next UN consolidated appeal for aid - the means by which it has requested help from international donors for the past eight years. Instead, it wants to switch the focus of support from short-term humanitarian food aid to long-term development assistance. </p> <p>The switch reflects a slight improvement in its food situation. Although levels of malnutrition remain high, international support and improved harvests have removed the immediate threat of famine. </p> <p>UN officials want the emergency appeal process to continue, because the country is still not growing nearly enough to feed its population. However, the government in Pyongyang is impatient to graduate from the humanitarian programme, which it associates with a humiliating dependency on outside charity. </p> <p>The arrival of a combatative new WFP country director - Richard Regan, from the US - may also have raised North Korean fears that the aid agency will begin to push harder for access to regions that are currently deemed to be off limits because they house military institutions and political internment camps. </p> <p>According to the Los Angeles Times, the government also wants to shut down some smaller aid agencies, viewing them as an intrusive presence. The paper reported that, for the past month, South Korean NGOs have been refused permission to cross the border, and a number of projects have been postponed. </p> <p>Political dialogue with Seoul has also been interrupted since late July, when a record 468 defectors arrived in South Korea. Pyongyang accused its neighbour of \"kidnap\" - an absurd charge, but one that sent Seoul a message that it should not collude with efforts to destabilise the North through mass migration. </p> <p>The extent to which North Korea is willing - or able - to close the door remains unclear. The restrictions of the last few weeks have been far less significant than the openings of the last four years, the border with China remains porous, and a growing number of North Koreans have come to depend on foreign aid and business. </p> <p>The mostly likely explanation is that this is another strategic feint by a government that frequently switches between extremes as a negotiating tactic. With the six nation talks on the future of the peninsular at an impasse, the recent shut-out could be interpreted as an expression of North Korea's frustration that the nuclear issue is being used to thwart its economic development. </p> <p>However, if the door is closed more tightly for any length of time, the government will upset a lot of its own people, who now know - to a far greater extent than 10 years ago - that cooperation with the outside world can improve their standard of living. </p> <p>Should a disengagement with aid agencies result in a return to famine, the urge to flee rather than endure is thus likely to be far stronger than it was in the 90s. </p> <p>And as Pyongyang considers its next step, this is likely to weigh strongly against its reclusive instincts. Shutting down sympathetic outside-inners simply plays into the hands of the hostile inside-outers.</p>",
  "Doris Clark was driving through the reservation listening to the radio when she heard the news about the hurricane battering the coast hundreds of miles away. \"There was a state of emergency declared in Florida and President Bush said he'd give $2m to help people with no water and no electricity. And I thought, OK, we have that on the reservation. There are places where we have no running water and no electricity, no phone. Why doesn't anybody say there's a state of emergency at the reservation?\" <p>This is the Navajo Nation, an area the size of France in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. More than half its population live below the poverty level. With an average annual income of $6,000, (\u00a33,470) the Navajo constitute not only a nation within a nation, but a developing nation within a developed country. </p> <p>It is a state of affairs the federal establishment has been reluctant to acknowledge, which may explain why the Navajo have never been much interested in national politics. But in a presidential election in which every vote is cherished, the candidates have been trying to change that, paying more attention than ever before to Native Americans. </p> <p>George Bush held a private meeting with the vice-president of the Navajo Nation, Frank Dayish Jnr, before a campaign event in New Mexico in August. And John Kerry became the first presidential candidate to campaign on Native American land when he appeared at a meeting of Navajo and Zuni Indians in Gallup, New Mexico, 20 miles from Window Rock, Arizona. </p> <p>Although American Indians make up only 1.5% of the US population, many of them live in swing states. Their reservations contain the bulk of America's casinos and the income from gambling has turned the tribes into potential donors: they have given $36,000 (\u00a320,809) to the Bush campaign and $17,000 to Kerry's. </p> <p>And as with any poor ethnic minority in the US, the war in Iraq is a potent issue: proportionately more American Indians are serving in Iraq than any other ethnic group. When the Navajo do vote in federal elections they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat. </p> <p>\"It's kind of comical,\" said Edison Wauneka, executive director of the Navajo election administration, who says that 95% of registered Navajo voters are Democrats. \"The Navajo people say we're more familiar with a donkey [the Democratic party's symbol], we're not familiar with an elephant [the Republican symbol]. But really our culture is more similar to the Republicans. It is more in our culture to be self sufficient.\" </p> <p>Poverty is probably the greatest factor in shaping the political attitudes of the Navajo: 56% of the 180,000 people living as part of the Navajo nation are below the official poverty level. </p> <p>But apathy has been a core reason why the Navajo, who vote in numbers for their own internal government, have been luke-warm at best towards presidential campaigns. That might change if they felt they had more clout. Although they were granted sovereign nation status by the federal government in 1868 in exchange for giving up land rights, the Navajo vote in the three states that contain the reservation, reducing their impact. </p> <p>Some Navajo leaders would prefer it if they could have their own electoral college voting en bloc. </p> <p>There are 2.5m Native Americans in the US, and the Navajo is the largest tribe. \"When we vote for the president of the United States I wish we could vote as a nation,\" Mr Wauneka said. \"We say we're a sovereign nation but we don't own our lands. The Indian nations don't even have a voting bloc. If they were to come together they would become strong and make a difference.\" </p> <p>But Robert Black Jnr, another election authority official, believes the Navajo can be more influential voting in their respective states, particularly in potential swing states where their votes can have a disproportionate influence. </p> <p>\"We have the possibility of swinging electoral votes in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It could be less effective if it was a Navajo nation with its own electoral college,\" he said. </p> <p>The priority this November is to get the Navajo to vote, and so officials have moved the Navajo's own government elections to coincide with the presidential election. </p> <p>The apathy is not helped by language and tradition. The Navajo language is dying out, but many of the older generations do not speak English and have previously relied on picture cards and translators to help them vote. </p> <p>\"We're very proud of our picture ballots,\" said Mr Wauneka, holding up a yellow sample ballot card, with mugshots of the candidates alongside name and party allegiance listings. \"A lot of states have problems with language barriers and we think picture ballots can help.\" </p>",
  "Italy's newly liberated aid workers gave a muted account yesterday of their captivity in Iraq as debate raged over whether the country paid a ransom for their release. <p>The Italian government continued to deny the ransom reports but top officials hinted that reports a $1m (\u00a3550,000) ransom were paid were true. </p> <p>The alleged ransom payment has raised fears that militants in Iraq will view hostage taking as a quick way to a fortune, and will set price tags on the heads of scores of others still being held. </p> <p>Yesterday, the editor of a Kuwaiti paper whose contacts in Iraq have made it the paper of record on the fate of Simona Pari and Simona Torretta said there was no doubt money was paid. \"We know that the Italians agreed to pay. And we know they paid Italian money,\" said Ali al-Ruz, managing editor of Al-Rai al-Amm, which announced the imminent release of the Italian hostages before it happened. </p> <p>\"We do not know if the money was from the Italian state or from an individual or a businessman,\" said Mr Ruz, a British citizen who worked for years on the British-based daily Al Hayat before working in Kuwait. </p> <p>Independent reports in Italy yesterday said that the group which kidnapped the Italian women had accepted $50,000 to release four Egyptian telecoms employees on Wednesday, the day after the Italians were released. </p> <p>Yesterday, reports further indicated that the Vatican had played a major role in negotiating the women's release while the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano trumpeted its support for paying to save innocent lives. \"It does not matter now if this [gesture of] humanity needed to be solicited,\" the Vatican paper said. </p> <p>Some observers have also questioned the unusual nature of the Italian kidnap situation since the two 29-year-old aid workers returned to Italy looking relaxed and well after 21 days in captivity. </p> <p>In comments to journalists and at parties thrown in their honour on Wednesday night, the two experienced aid workers said Italy should withdraw its troops and thanked above all the Iraqi people and the Arab community calling on the world \"not to forget\" Iraq's suffering civilian population, above all its women and children. </p> <p>Officially, Italy continues to deny the ransom reports. But the prime minister himself, who has been accused in the past of dipping into his own deep personal pockets to resolve crises, has raised suspicion by his recent comments. </p> <p>\"A ransom? You will see that in a few months, no one will be talking about this any more. We are not saying anything about this business now,\" the Italian media reported Silvio Berlusconi saying over an ice-cream when the hostages were safely home. </p> <p>New information yesterday suggested that his government had resorted to cheque book diplomacy to save the two women and avert the public relations catastrophe of Italy watching them having their throats cut on screen. </p> <p>The Corriere della Sera newspaper said Italian prosecutors now knew that the kidnappers had played recorded messages from the two Italian women to the mobile phone of Navar Ismar, a 31-year-old Iraqi doctor currently in Rome, who has worked closely with the Italian Red Cross in several recent hostage situations. </p> <p>In one message to Dr Ismar they read requests for $15,000- worth of medication to be sent to Iraq. On September 20, the paper said, another phone message said: \"The medicines have reached the hospital. We are fine but please don't delay.\" </p> <p>The Italian intelligence services knew by this stage that the women were being held in a house about 37 miles from Baghdad. </p> <p>Dr Ismar's leaked statements to the Italian prosecutors appear to confirm Al-Rai al-Amm's original report that a payment was made in two stages; first $500,000 for negotiators to ensure the kidnapped women were alive, and the same sum at the moment of their release. </p> <p>The Italian Red Cross, which brought the women home, has denied it had any involvement in a ransom payment. </p> <p>Yesterday, after speaking to the media and spending a night celebrating their freedom at the Rome City Hall in the Piazza del Campidoglio, Ms Pari and Ms Torretta gave a brief press conference, saying they could not go into details of their experience because a judicial inquiry had begun. The women are re ported to have told prosecutors they were subjected to a kind of video trial in the early stages of their ordeal, when their captors believed they were spies. </p> <p>When it became clear that they were humanitarian workers, they were treated with respect. \"The relationship improved,\" Ms Torretta said yesterday. \"They checked out who we were. They gave us towels and soap and books about Islam, and they made us read the Qur'an. Our treatment was privileged, possibly helped by us being women.\" </p> <p>Leftwing Italian politicians said yesterday that there was nothing wrong with paying a ransom, given the chaotic conditions in Iraq. </p> <p>\"Who cares?\" said Antonio di Pietro, the prosecutor remembered for leading Italy's Tangentopoli corruption investigations in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Fabio Alberti, head of the women's aid group A Bridge to Baghdad, told a reporter who asked if a ransom had been paid: \"This question must be put to those who can pay, like the government, the Red Crescent\".</p>",
  "<p>Like a pantomime villain trying to elicit \"boos\" from small children, Martin Tomlinson, Selfish Cunt's spangly but spiteful singer, will try anything to get a reaction.

  "<p>There have been several important collections of the music of Silvestre Revueltas (1899-1940) released during the past decade, most notably the one issued by Sony and conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. </p> <p>But his strikingly original music - the finest to come out of Mexico so far - remains very much a minority interest. Why he has been neglected for so long is hard to understand, because Revueltas's finest works - many of them included on this latest issue, which consists of recordings made at a public concert in Holland in November last year - have musical charm, humour and an originality that ranks him among the leading composers from the Americas in the period between the two world wars. </p> <p>This collection is described as a survey of his \"chamber- works\", but the term is applied quite loosely, and some of Revueltas's authentic chamber pieces, such as the string quartets, are not included at all. His best known work, Sensemay\u00e1, is played in the original 1937 version for 15 instruments rather than the later one for full orchestra. </p> <p>The smaller-scale scoring only emphasises its vivid musical fusion of the raw-edged sound of Mexican mariachi bands and the modernism of Var\u00e8se and Stravinsky. Masterpieces such as Ocho por Radio (1933) and the three-movement Homenaje a Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (1936) are here too, all of them played with just the right rhythmic energy and awareness of instrumental colour. </p> <p>But those pieces are included on nearly every Revueltas collection; it's the rarities on this disc that make it special. There's the study-like set of Pieza Para Doce Instrumentos, composed in 1929 shortly after the composer returned to Mexico from the US, and Planos of 1934, the nearest thing to unvarnished modernism that he ever attempted. These lie alongside pieces reconstituted after his death, such as the scraps of incidental music for the satirical play Esta Era un Rey, one of his final scores in 1940, and Hora de Junio, composed in 1938 to accompany readings of three sonnets by Carlos Pelicer, whom Revueltas had met when he went to Spain during the civil war in in 1937. </p> <p> How much of the latter is Revueltas's own work and how much the result of \"editing\" by his protege, Jos\u00e9 Limantour, is hard to determine, for Revueltas's music remains plagued with textual discrepancies. Even a relatively familiar piece like the Lorca tribute exists in two versions. On this disc, however, the Ebony Band reconcile these for their performance, reasoning - quite correctly - that it is the boundless freshness and energy of the music that matters most of all, and defines Revueltas's importance.</p>",
  "<p>There have been several important collections of the music of Silvestre Revueltas (1899-1940) released during the past decade, most notably the one issued by Sony and conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. But his strikingly original music - the finest to come out of Mexico so far - remains very much a minority interest. Why he has been neglected for so long is hard to understand, because Revueltas's finest works - many of them included on this latest issue, which consists of recordings made at a public concert in Holland in November last year - have musical charm, humour and an originality that ranks him among the leading composers from the Americas in the period between the two world wars.</p> <p>This collection is described as a survey of his \"chamberworks\", but the term is applied quite loosely, and some of Revueltas's authentic chamber pieces, such as the string quartets, are not included at all. His best known work, Sensemay\u00e1, is played in the original 1937 version for 15 instruments rather than the later one for full orchestra. The smaller-scale scoring only emphasises its vivid musical fusion of the raw-edged sound of Mexican mariachi bands and the modernism of Var\u00e8se and Stravinsky. Masterpieces such as Ocho por Radio (1933) and the three-movement Homenaje a Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (1936) are here too, all of them played with just the right rhythmic energy and awareness of instrumental colour.</p> <p>But those pieces are included on nearly every Revueltas collection; it's the rarities on this disc that make it special. There's the study-like set of Pieza Para Doce Instrumentos, composed in 1929 shortly after the composer returned to Mexico from the US, and Planos of 1934, the nearest thing to unvarnished modernism that he ever attempted. These lie alongside pieces reconstituted after his death, such as the scraps of incidental music for the satirical play Esta Era un Rey, one of his final scores in 1940, and Hora de Junio, composed in 1938 to accompany readings of three sonnets by Carlos Pelicer, whom Revueltas had met when he went to Spain during the civil war in in 1937.</p> <p>How much of the latter is Revueltas's own work and how much the result of \"editing\" by his protege, Jos\u00e9 Limantour, is hard to determine, for Revueltas's music remains plagued with textual discrepancies. Even a relatively familiar piece like the Lorca tribute exists in two versions. On this disc, however, the Ebony Band reconcile these for their performance, reasoning - quite correctly - that it is the boundless freshness and energy of the music that matters most of all, and defines Revueltas's importance.</p>",
  "<p>A few months ago I was offered an acting job that caused me some alarm. Now, film acting isn't usually an alarming job, especially if you portray a subsidiary villain or a henchman. In these circumstances you just show up the day before you're needed and hang around, in a hotel or trailer, occasionally being brought to the set to threaten innocents or be outsmarted. </p> <p>On a film set, as is only right and proper, the focus is on the principal actors, and most of the day is spent awaiting, beautifying and recording them. Subsidiary villains, henchmen, and moustachioed police detectives tend to be left till late in the afternoon, when the light is starting to fail, which means our scenes are normally master shots, rather than more time-consuming close-ups. Which is - provided you've learned your lines - a swift and stress-free way to work. I have hustled through scenes in which the light was fading fast in the US, Mexico, Liverpool, and Spain. It has always been delightful. So my anxiety was caused not by the job, but by the location. </p> <p>The film was called Rosario Tijeras, a French-Spanish-Mexican co-production, and it was being filmed in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. My impression of Colombia (a country I'd never been to before) was of a fiefdom of the Pentagon, where trade unionists were murdered, death squads ran riot, and gringo actors never trod. If I went, I would either be kidnapped, or arrested on charges trumped up by the CIA. The more I thought about it, the less I wanted to go, and so I told the production that the dates were difficult. This, inevitably, made them want me more, and they changed the dates to accommodate me. So, having run out of excuses, I flew from London to Madrid, from Madrid to Bogot\u00e1, and from Bogot\u00e1 to Medell\u00edn, to play the gringo Donovan, head of a drug cartel. </p> <p>Reading the script in my hotel, though, I was unable to find Donovan's part. Rosario Tijeras is the story of a beautiful young girl, named after a pair of scissors, who becomes a leading light in the Medell\u00edn narco-world: the film is set when the trade and its practitioners were at their most ostentatious, in the 1980s. Rosario had a great role, ruining several men in her precipitous career, and there were other decent characters from the acting viewpoint. But no Donovan. </p> <p>Next day on set, I sought out the director, Emilio Maill\u00e9, to ask where Donovan was. I had worked out an elaborate rationale for why the leader of this particular cartel was a gringo, and was sure his scenes' omission was an oversight. \"Not at all,\" Emilio told me, beaming: \"You've been reading an old script, in which your character was called Rodriguez. When we heard you were coming, naturally, we changed the name.\" </p> <p>It seemed to me that some of the actors in a dining room scene were whispering. I asked the director about this. Emilio told me that he wanted all the acting to be \"subtil\". Subtle acting? From someone whose only training has been The Art of Coarse Acting? I walked back to the hotel and read Rodriguez's scenes. </p> <p>Rosario Tijeras is a mini-epic spanning several years. I would be lying if I said that Rodriguez/Donovan has a lot to do with it. Basically, he and Rosario have three scenes. In one, he sits in a disco and beckons in a sinister fashion to our heroine. In another, they get on a plane bound for Miami. In the third, he and Rosario are by the pool: he insults her, and she stabs him with a knife. </p> <p>Rosario is played by Flora Mart\u00ednez, a Colombian New Yorker who is both beautiful and a proper actress. I knew none of the cast - most of them Colombians from Bogot\u00e1 - though I'd worked with some of the Mexican crew before, and had met the director and the producer, Matthias Ehrenberg, in Mexico City. </p> <p>My first couple of days were spent getting costumed at different bodegas in the south end of the city. The director's desire that I be subtle had not been conveyed to the wardrobe department, and on my first day of shooting - at the Olaya Herrera Airport - they presented me with a multicoloured polyester shirt, pointy black shoes, two- tone shades, and tons of gold chains and jewellery. Though not subtle, it was certainly effective, and much enjoyed by the guards at the airport gate. But Emilio didn't fancy the look, and had me fitted out with a more restrained guayabera and monotone aviators instead. </p> <p>During my time off, I took to walking down to the metro station and riding the spotless public transport into town. There is a modern art museum in the city centre, with a floor dedicated to Fernando Botero's paintings and sculpture. This isn't just the innocent-fat-people-art we see in European museums: there's a painting of a car bomb exploding and another of a sky full of devils, plus a quasi-religious miniature entitled La Muerte de Pablo Escobar - celebrating the demise of Medell\u00edn's most famous drug dealer, who had himself made a senator, and who funded many civic works. It soon became apparent that the greatest danger I faced wasn't a car bomb or a death squad kidnapping, but being run over: they drive faster and more aggressively in Medell\u00edn than anywhere else I've been. </p> <p>One day we filmed in the home of a former drug lord, since extradited to the US. It was in a private apartment building, high in the hills overlooking the city. There were four huge apartments, one on top of the other, each with its own enormous pool. Can you estimate how much a swimming pool full of water weighs? Now imagine four of them, one on top of the other, and you start to get an idea of the massive strength of the construction, and of the money that went into it. It made the drug lord's pad in Clear and Present Danger look like a country cottage. And it was real. </p> <p>I had a great time, drunkenly harassing Flora in her hot-pink bathing suit and doing laps in the ex-drug-kingpin's pool. Donovan, naturally, swam wearing his Rolex and gold chains. And by the end of the day, after sitting on this man's patio, swimming in his pool and viewing his modern art collection, I started to feel sorry for him - residing as he now does in a supermax-security jail cell, 3m by 3m, somewhere in the US. </p> <p>No doubt the guy was a bastard and a murderer, and a seller of drugs. But people in the US and Europe bought those drugs, and smoked or snorted them, entirely voluntarily. We hear about the Escobars being shot to death and the Ochoas extradited, but what about the Donovans? We know the names of the Colombian and Mexican bad guys, but what of the white men making even bigger profits from the trade in England and the US? Somehow, their names remain unknown. </p> <p>Donovan's last scene was shot in an abandoned, ruined factory. Here Salvador Parra, the great Mexican production designer, had made a replica of El Acuarius, a famous disco from the 1980s. This was the era of gold chains and overt drug money, and the scene was a private party, thrown by the narcos, for 200 of their closest friends. And everybody was dressed entirely in white. Not just Rosario, and Donovan, and our respective entourages, but the entire cast, and all 200 extras. This wasn't an eccentric design choice of Parra's, it turned out: they really did all dress like this, back at those 1980s Medell\u00edn narco parties (white - like coca, get it?). </p> <p>I was quite touched by this demented scene. In spite of all the gangsterism, and the killing, I was charmed by the sheer naffness of it. It was, in a very weird way, innocent. Which I think is the point of Rosario Tijeras: that innocence coexists with corruption and cruelty, at least for a while. </p> <p>On my last night in Medell\u00edn, I chatted with the local producer, about the possibility of some kind of peace settlement in the country, and about his plans for the film, which - despite its multinational provenance - he thought of as distinctly homegrown. He talked about plans for the premiere, and I found myself angling for an invitation to attend the gala do, some time in 2005. </p> <p>He had great hopes for Rosario Tijeras, a low-budget, Spanish-speaking picture about to enter the great, cold world of big-budget, American-speaking films. Maybe he was overly optimistic, like a Medell\u00edn kid dreaming of the high life, or those drug lords, piling swimming pools on top of each other and putting their own money into one of the cleanest and most efficient metro systems I have ever ridden. </p> <p>I didn't know what to make of it, either, when the Colombian producer mentioned offhand that I and most of the other foreign crew were completely safe on the streets of Medell\u00edn because nobody knew us. Whereas he had to move into a hotel when the filming took place, because everyone knew he had money, and he risked being kidnapped for ransom every time he went home. It didn't seem to worry him unduly. No more than the homicidal drivers, anyway. </p> <p>I don't know how the film has turned out or will turn out. It seemed to mean a lot at the time, particularly to the Colombians - who were putting in long hours for little money because this wasn't an advert, or a soap opera, but a feature film, and the distinction was something to be proud of. British and European film-makers complain about similar things, but we don't have to do our work in circumstances that are remotely similar. </p> <p>The news we get about Colombia continues to be bad: another trade unionist murdered, another peace community attacked, more money from the EU for the US-sponsored war. This had set me up to expect a bad experience, or at least an alienating one. Instead, I had a profitable and educational time, and even, maybe, a cause for optimism in the ghastly Sargasso sea of sunk hopes that is the world of feature films. </p> <p>So, if there are any other producers thinking of filming in war-torn but lovely countries, and looking for a drug lord or a subsidiary henchman, I still have the white suit and the fake, waterlogged Rolex ...</p>",
  "The government is to put out to tender all its dedicated juvenile jails that hold children under 18 in a departure in Whitehall's privatisation programme, the Guardian has learned. <p>The four institutions are to be offered as a job lot to be run by a private prison company in a deal thought to be worth \u00a350m as part of an attempt to boost competition and \"choice\" in the penal system. It is also thought to be designed to tempt US prison firms into the British market. </p> <p>The institutions are Huntercombe near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire; Warren Hill, in Woodbridge, Suffolk; Wetherby in West Yorkshire and Werrington in Stoke-on-Trent. Warren Hill has a special unit which holds teenage murderers and others given very long sentences. </p> <p>They hold 1,000 offenders including some of the most dangerous. They - with Ashfield near Bristol, which is privately run by Premier Prison Services - are the only dedicated prisons for the under 18s. Other publicly-run young offender institutions also hold teenagers but they are mixed with young adults up to the age of 21. </p> <p>The leak of the plan, which is being proposed by Martin Narey, the chief executive of the new National Offender Management Service, has caused alarm among reformers and prison unions. </p> <p>Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"We have not seen any proof that private prison companies are any better at running child jails.\" </p> <p>Colin Moses, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said it would hold an emergency meeting today to consider boycotting the tender process. \"They should remain in the public sector, not for ideological reasons, but because those who are responsible for the most vulnerable in our society have a duty not to make a profit from their suffering.\" </p> <p>At Ashfield the situation became so bad two years ago that Mr Narey invoked his powers for the first time to replace a private prison director with a state prison governor. But the record of child jails run by the Prison Service is also poor, with 11 suicides of teenagers in the past five years. </p> <p>The scheme is being considered by Home Office ministers and if, as expected, it goes ahead next year, the four institutions will become the first public sector prisons in Britain to be handed over to the private sector. In the past the government proposed privatising Brixton but no company was interested enough to bid for a single failing inner city south London prison. </p> <p>The four all have relatively good records and some have undergone recent refurbishment. Earlier this year the merger of Group 4 and Securicor halved the number of private prison companies operating in Britain and Mr Narey has tried to persuade US companies to bid for British contracts. </p> <p>The two largest private prison operators in the US, the Geo Group and the Corrections Corporation of America, have been involved in running British prisons and immigration detention centres in the last 10 years but have both pulled out in the last few years. </p> <p>Mr Narey made clear he was going to offer \"clusters\" of prisons to increase interest and the four juvenile jails are to be the first \"themed cluster\" to be put out to tender. </p> <p>It is believed they have been chosen to pioneer this programme - known as \"contestability\" in the Whitehall jargon - because unlike many state prisons they already have defined contracts as part of their relationship with the Youth Justice Board, which \"buys\" places at each of the jails. </p> <p>Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation union, said that \"contestability\" was another word for privatisation or market testing and was a \"cynical attempt to drive down costs\". </p> <p>It is believed that an attempt to put the work of the north-west probation area out to tender will follow next.</p>",
  "After decades of vowing \"no surrender\", the hardline Unionist leader Ian Paisley yesterday made an historic journey south of the Northern Ireland border for his first political meeting with an Irish prime minister in Dublin. <p>The talks were a symbolic step in Northern Ireland's intricate political dance to restore devolution before Tony Blair's tentative deadline of Christmas. All eyes are on Mr Paisley to see if his Democratic Unionist Party, now the biggest party in Northern Ireland, will sit down in a power-sharing government with Sinn F\u00e9in. </p> <p>Initiating a meeting in Dublin with the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, was a near complete reversal of Mr Paisley's lifetime hostility to political contacts with the south. He once threw snowballs at a previous taoiseach who came to Belfast. A invitation sent to Mr Paisley's Belfast headquarters in the 1980s was returned with \"no surrender\" written over it, according to a former press officer in the Dublin government. </p> <p>Mr Paisley's party attended meetings with Mr Ahern earlier this year in London, to avoid the sensitivities of travelling to Dublin. His one visit to Dublin to meet the taoiseach five years ago was in his capacity as leader of the Free Presbyterian church to discuss arson attacks on his churches along the border.He resolutely refused to discuss politics. </p> <p>The 78-year-old undisputed leader of unionism yesterday arrived at government buildings in Dublin saying: \"Where Ulster's issues are being discussed you can't do without Ian Paisley.\" After the meeting, he said there was no evidence to suggest an IRA offer to disarm was on the table, and that the IRA must disband before his party could make a deal for devolved government. </p> <p>Despite Mr Blair's claims of a breakthrough on the IRA handing over guns and stopping paramilitary activity, the Stormont assembly remains suspended while unionists and nationalists are deadlocked over the shape of a power-sharing government. </p> <p>The DUP want more checks and balances. Nationalists refuse to change the Good Friday agreement and say unionists are trying to seize control of Stormont. They also accuse the DUP of trying to water-down cross-border cooperation between Stormont and the Dublin government. </p> <p>Mr Paisley said the meeting was a cordial \"exchange of views\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sinn F\u00e9in negotiators yesterday arrived in the US to lobby politicians to defend the Good Friday agreement from a DUP \"attack\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Holm thoughts for Radcliffe </strong></p> <p> What were you doing the moment Paula stopped? Each time? It seems an age, but it is just five weeks ago that Paula Radcliffe harrowingly inflicted that second cruel penance on herself in the 10,000 metres in Athens. You can still sense indignation in Britain's taprooms, as well as its tabloids - as if our poor champion had actually screwed up just to spite them personally.</p> <p> Former marathon moll Liz McColgan was particularly bitchy this week - \"It would never have crossed my mind to stop. I can't understand why Paula just stopped. It was as if, because she wasn't going to win a medal, it didn't mean anything.\" So it was a relief at once to come across an unlikely, ungloating insight from the courtly 73-year-old thespian Sir Ian Holm, who in an illuminating interview with Andrew Billen about his new autobiography recalled the trauma of his abandoning the stage for all of 17 years in 1976 after fleeing the theatre in midspeech and performance of The Iceman Cometh. </p> <p>Stage fright, he said, was an inadequate phrase: \"I went mad, sort of mad ... the Paula syndrome. She was saying to herself: 'I don't know - I can't explain it. I've worked hard and trained in heat far worse than this, but my legs just - my legs just stopped.' It was exactly the same for me that night in 1967: the brain just stopped.\" </p> <p><strong>Davies escapes his damned spot </strong></p> <p>Barry Davies was BBC's all-seasons safe pair of hands who neither tore a passion to tatters nor split the ears of us couchlings. He let the pictures do the talking, be it hockey, tennis, rowing, soccer, anything ... and even if you knew he really didn't have a remote clue about the arcane intricacies of pommel-horse somersaulting or floor dancing with ribbons, viewers were content in the knowledge that the boy had mugged up far more than we'd ever need to know. Latterly drawing the short straws, Barry even made an art form of calling the forced festive flummery and tripe - and all those martial marches - at excruciating Olympic opening ceremonies; last month his \"and they are a bit short tonight, the Chinese\" sort of said it all. </p> <p>Though that true-great feastfounder Coleman himself, Murray Walker, Ted Lowe and confr\u00e8re and rival Motty easily head the list, Davies's detached, almost donnish desire to hold his tongue till engaging his brain made him a very rare Colemanballs contributor - so let my three favourites of his suffice as a swansong salutation: \"Paul Scholes, completely anonymous so far ...\" \"See how his left boot was poised with the trigger cocked ...\" \"Penalty? Or is it? Is this a spot which I see before me?\" </p> <p><strong> Cold winds and colder hearts in Aberdeen </strong></p> <p> Bazza would have been the man to ask about the coldest grounds in British soccer. His engaging corporation comrade Mark Saggers canvassed nominations the other night on Radio Five. They poured in ... every frostbitten, foot-stamping stadium in Scotland, of course, and the far east, but also votes for Huddersfield, Stoke, Oldham and West Brom. </p> <p>The climate cannot have changed since my regular soccer-beat days a decade or two ago, so surely Port Vale is still the bleakest of terraced turrets when the winter gales ravage down through the Staffordshire gap? And my fingers turn icechip immobile again and refuse to write simply at the memory of one January night at Grimsby, a ground symbolically surrounded by fishfreezing factories: I mentioned in my piece that we could see polar bears basking in the Humber estuary, but had to ring the office to say, sorry, they were only ice floes. </p> <p> In those early 1980s Alex Ferguson's Aberdeen were full of themselves and I was sent to Pittodrie - an icicle blizzard arrowing in from the sea 200 yards away (next stop Stavanger) and, welcoming this southerner with a sneer, the pressbox steward not only gave me an outside seat but suddenly decided to enforce the new Safety of Sports Grounds Act. With venomous Celtic relish the swine confiscated my two hipflasks (charged with Dons' Dram, the club's branded malt) as well as my two newly purchased and piping hot Boots hot-water bottles. I was far too cold to speak, let alone argue, but, in turn, I have relished Aberdeen's decline ever since. </p> <p><strong>When even quick tons dragged </strong></p> <p> There was nice pointed symmetry when the cricket summer was brought to a happy end at Lord's with the venerable Lawrence Trophy award, antique for sports sponsorship, with toasts this year to Somerset's Richard Johnson for the fastest century of the first-class season - 100 in 63 balls v Durham at the Riverside in August. Apt because it was the jubilee award, 70 years since its foundation by builder and cricket nut Sir Walter Lawrence in 1934 when Frank Woolley won it with his century for Kent at Dover in 63 minutes. Which, I suppose, underlines how batsmanship has become furiouser and furiouser. </p> <p>The award at his one-year Marylebone fiefdom was made by new MCC president Tom Graveney, who won it in 1968 with a 174-ball century. But by no means was great Tom's the slowest fastest - that was two years later by (no need even to guess, is there?) Geoffrey Boycott: in all of 222 balls at The Oval in 1970. Ah me, were those really the good ol' days?</p>"
