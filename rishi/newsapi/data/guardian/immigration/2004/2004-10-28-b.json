  "<p>Gareth Edwards may have been voted the best rugby player of all time but it cut little ice with the marketing team gathered in Soho yesterday to launch the 2005 Lions shirt. \"We had hoped to get Bill Beaumont to come along,\" one marketing man said, \"but Gareth Evans is here.\" </p> <p>Edwards, capped 10 times by the Lions and part of the 1971 party that is still the only Great Britain and Ireland team to win in New Zealand in 100 years, was alongside Sir Clive Woodward to unveil the skimpy 2005 number. It comes in two styles - figure-hugging for the backs, more roomy for the forwards - and in eight sizes. </p> <p>Adidas has worked on the fabric - designed to keep the heat out for Britain's Olympic athletes in Athens - to make Woodward's men comfortable in the New Zealand winter next year. It will be part of 60 pieces of kit issued to each player. </p> <p>\"On my first trip with the Lions - to South Africa in 1968 - we weren't issued with kit as such,\" said Edwards, 57. \"We were given a voucher to buy a couple of pairs of boots and a couple of shirts. </p> <p>\"They came in two sizes and had to fit everyone. I remember looking across the changing room and Gerald Davies [whippet-like wing] looked like he was wearing a nightgown. It came down to his knees and there were great folds of cloth under his armpits. </p> <p>\"And the weight of the damned things once you'd had a soaking; we [had] wanted one all our lives and it was hanging on us.\" </p> <p>Edwards knows what happened to the three shirts he had in New Zealand. One hangs in the Arms Park museum - \"alongside Barry John's boots\" - he has one himself, and the third he swapped with his opposite number, Sid Going. \"I'd like to think he's still got it; I've still got his. I'm not saying it meant more, but in those days the only guys who got a British Lions shirt were the ones that had earned them. There were no replicas so it was more special, more personal, and people cherished them.\" </p> <p>Woodward's 44-strong squad - there were 33 players in 1971 when the Lions won 2-1 with one game drawn - will have new kit for each match. They will also benefit from a 26-strong back-up team which includes seven coaches, two fitness coaches, a kicking coach, two doctors and three physios. </p> <p>On the 1971 Lions tour, which had started in Australia, Edwards said: \"We didn't have coaches as such at that time. I suppose Carwyn James was really the first for the Lions. Before that you just had assistant tour managers. </p> <p>\"Doug Smith, our tour manager, would put a tracksuit on - he wouldn't have got into one of these jerseys - and doubled up as doctor because he was one, and we picked up a local physio. He was fantastic, but just a rub-a-dub-dub man. Just basic stuff. If you had an injury you had to get a taxi and go down the hospital. </p> <p>\"Our kickers looked after themselves. Barry John used to have half a dozen goes at the end of training just to see if his timing was on. He started kicking on the second game in Sydney. I used to kick for Wales, but it really was a case of whoever fancied it. It was wet and windy and when we got a penalty about 40 yards out everyone just looked at each other. Barry stepped forward, put it over.\" </p> <p>Woodward, though, leaves less to chance. His team manager, Louise Ramsay, is on a recce and Woodward has seven years of notes on New Zealand from his time with England. Next week he will begin working with Wales as they prepare to face the All Blacks next month during their European tour. </p> <p>By the time Graham Henry's side fly home, Woodward will also have been involved with France and Italy before naming two complete sides, plus replacements, for next June and July. </p> <p>\"There's a little bit of envy,\" said Edwards. \"But it was enough for the time. Did we used to have a play book? Heavens no. We just used to read the papers and see where we went wrong.\" </p> <p><strong>Then and now </strong></p> <p><strong>Lions v All Blacks</strong></p> <p> <strong> Numbers</strong> <br> 1971: 33 players plus a team manager and coach <br> 2000: 44 players plus a team of 26 managerial and medical staff <br></p> <p><strong> Itinerary </strong> <br> 1971: 26 matches <br> 2000: 11 matches spread between two squads of 22 <br></p> <p><strong> Coach</strong> <br> 1971: Welshman Carwyn James, with 13 compatriots in the squad <br> 2000: Sir Clive Woodward. Guided England to the World Cup in 2003 <br> <strong> Selection </strong> <br> 1971: A committee with representatives from each country <br> 2000: Woodward will be 'the sole selector, the voted final arbiter' <br></p> <p><strong> Catering</strong> <br> 1971: Players had to use food vouchers <br> 2000: The Lions will have their own chef <br></p>",
  "<p>The cover of Kuljit Bhamra's <strong>Burning at Melting Point</strong> (Keda, \u00a39.99) could be spotted on the front of last week's Friday Review - just one CD among the torrent of albums that music reviewers deal with each week. Where do you start? It's useful when the packaging provides a clue to the contents, but Bhamra's artwork - the percussionist's walking stick encased in a block of ice - isn't much help. A line on the back promises, \"A rich fusion of east and west to chill your mind,\" which sounds like something you might order from a juice bar. </p> <p>I prefer blunt statements like the one on <strong>Breakfast in Balquhidder</strong> (Backshore, \u00a314.99) by Orchestra Macaroon: \"WARNING: This product may contain traces of bagpipes.\" Brilliant. Just the sort of information you need when sorting through a tottering pile of CDs. Rodrigo y Gabriela's <strong> Live Manchester and Dublin </strong> (Rubyworks, \u00a310.99) could justifiably claim \"traces of heavy metal\". Their Mexican-Flamenco guitar duo repertoire includes a cover of Metallica's One that moves into Paul Desmond's Take Five, with a snatch of the White Stripes. There's a wild streak to these recordings I've not heard in previous performances by Rodrigo y Gabriela, and it's very welcome. This is a World Music album that swings. </p> <p> <strong>To The Stars</strong> (Stretch, \u00a313.99) by the un-swinging virtuosi of the Chick Corea Elektric Band, cries out for warning stickers - \"this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology\". Based on the sci-fi novel by Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, it's a concept album that drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians (including John Patitucci and Eric Marienthal) through conceptual purgatory. </p> <p> <strong>Baila! Gitano Baila!</strong> (Tzadik, \u00a314.99) by Septeto Rodriguez, contains traces of just about everything except bagpipes, and is certainly the only Jewish-Cuban-Gypsy fusion CD in my collection. Rodriguez is one of those super-drummers who's played with everyone from Miami Sound Machine to Lester Bowie (via Joe Jackson and Julio Iglesias). He drummed in Marc Ribot Y Los Cubanos Postizos (Prosthetic Cubans), and his Septeto has some of Ribot's groovy insouciance. Yet the timbres are different: accordion, clarinet, string trio and trombone, plus Brad Jones on bass. The title track exemplifies Rodriguez's method - a killer clave set against a sneaking bass and impassioned melodies for brass and strings, like music from a tradition that's never been heard before. </p> <p>Drummer/percussionists often make good bandleaders and producers, but find solo albums more of a challenge. Rodriguez makes music so specialised he can be number one in a field of one; Bhamra drums expertly with a diverse set of collaborators. Bhamra's Burning at Melting Point contains odd traces of Julian Clary (think camp Indo-Kraftwerk) and Barb Jungr (30 seconds of blues harmonica). Level 42's Mike Lindup, Chapman Stick player Nick Beggs, guitarist Edward Niebla and Brit-jazz maestro Michael Garrick also appear. Oh, and Steafan Hannigan plays Irish pipes on a couple of tracks. </p> <p>And, by the way, that pipes warning on Breakfast in Balquhidder was misleading since the whole album is full of them - Hispanic gaitas as well as Uilleann, Highland and Border pipes. Admittedly, they're juxtaposed with congas, piano, flugelhorn, Yang Qin, and sea samples (Bhamra uses these too) plus rhythmic experimentation, but it's a seriously bagpipe-driven 53 minutes. And as unlikely fusions go, Rodriguez's Baila! Gitano Baila! really works.</p>",
  "All morning they emerged from Yasser Arafat's prison with assurances that the ageing revolutionary was not done for yet. <p>Hanan Ashrawi, the former peace negotiator, revealed that \"the president\" had managed to keep down a breakfast of cornflakes and milk. This was interpreted as a good sign, given that Mr Arafat had vomited his dinner over his prime minister the previous evening before collapsing. </p> <p>Others marched out of the muqata to reveal that Mr Arafat was awake or sleeping, was eating or on a drip feed, was on the mend or not feeling too good again. </p> <p>But on closer questioning, it turned out that none had actually seen the Palestinian leader. He was firmly sealed away by a small group of close confidants. </p> <p>Far more was revealed by what was missing. No one had whipped up the crowds of Fatah youth to chant revolutionary slogans next to the piles of rubble and flattened cars that still remain from when the Israeli military tore the compound apart around Mr Arafat. </p> <p>A young man, Fares Arruri, summed up how many feel about what appeared to be the looming demise of the man who has so shaped their lives. </p> <p>\"Arafat the leader will die but Arafat the symbol will live on. This is better for both the Palestinian people and Arafat because leaders are imperfect but symbols are perfect,\" he said. </p> <p>By lunchtime, the pretence that Mr Arafat was suffering only a minor lapse was gone and a grim mood settled over the muqata while its inhabitants awaited teams of doctors from across the Arab world - Jordan, Egypt and Tunisia - as well as Mr Arafat's wife, Suha. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Israeli troops yesterday shot dead an eight-year-old Palestinian girl on her way to school in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. An Israeli military official said the incident was under investigation.</p>",
  "With China in the throes of a remarkable transition, it cannot be easy for any of the country's newspaper editors to fulfil their contradictory roles as old-style communist propaganda organs and new-capitalist profit-hunters and public watchdogs. <p>But you have to feel particular sympathy for the editor of the <b>People's Daily</b> - the party mouthpiece and one-time font of public morality - who has to perform acts of intellectual and ethical contortionism to reconcile the nation's past ideals, current reality and future aspirations. </p> <p>The past week has seen some particularly excruciating editorial twists as the paper - along with most other state-run media outlets - attempted to get to grips with the worst mining disaster of the year. </p> <p>At least 129 people died in the Henan Daping coal mine explosion last week. Rescuers are still searching for 19 other miners, \"whose survival chances are slim\", according to the state news agency, <b>Xinhua</b>, yesterday. </p> <p>That the accident has received widespread coverage over the last week represents a breakthrough in the Chinese media. Fatal mining accidents are an almost weekly occurrence in a huge country that relies on coal for more than 70% of its energy needs. In the first nine months of this year, 4,153 miners have been killed in fires, floods and explosions, yet their deaths usually go unreported. </p> <p>At first, criticism of the conditions that led to the Daping accident was muted. But once the president, Hu Jintao, and the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, called for improved industry safety standards, the floodgates opened. Four days after the disaster, the People's Daily published a trenchant commentary in which it noted one-third of state-owned mines are overloaded and private firms sacrifice safety for profits. The paper quoted academics who blamed the crisis on the weakness of local governments. </p> <p>The <b>Beijing News</b> went much further. \"These workers didn't have any safety training or knowledge,\" it said. \"Even if they knew the risks, there was nothing they could do. Owners don't listen to miners' voices. And the government's priority is economic growth, not people's conditions.\" </p> <p>A sympathetic touch was added by the <b>China Youth Daily</b>, which carried long interviews with the families of the victims, 95% of whom were migrant farmers - the giant underclass that is working the hardest and suffering the most to fuel China's explosive economic growth. </p> <p>That growth has produced vast inequalities, which have been highlighted by a raft of \"rich list\" publications, including one by <b>Euromoney China</b> that showed Huang Guangyu, founder of China's largest electronics retail chain, in top spot with a fortune of 10.5 bn yuan (\u00a3690m). The <b>Beijing Morning Post</b> preferred to focus on a ranking of \"China's Most Luxurious Houses\". Only the <b>China Daily</b> stopped to think about those still left out in the cold. \"Maybe it is time to publish a list of problems affecting those less fortunate,\" urged the English-language paper. </p> <p>The often impressive coverage of social inequality and industrial disaster contrasts with a number of other recent stories that have been withheld, including the rising number of protests by laid-off or poorly paid workers, a riot last week in Chongqing, and a peace march in Taiwan by 2.5 million people. </p> <p>It reflects that two-steps forward, one-step backward process of media reform in China. Plotting a path through this shifting and treacherous media terrain is an immense challenge for editors. Making moral sense of the changes taking place is an even greater challenge. Little wonder then that editorials in the People's Daily often end up sounding painfully strained and convoluted. </p> <p>In a recent piece approving the communist party's measures to improve the morality of university students, it stressed the need for \"political education in every area of study based on Deng Xiaoping Theory\" and the study of \"Marxism and Leninism\". Greater prominence, however, was given to a interview with William Owens, the former vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff. </p> <p>Now chief executive of a Canadian IT firm, Mr Owens waxed lyrical in the People's Daily about profitability, competition and transparency. What Marx and Lenin would have made of such comments is anyone's guess. But it is far more relevant to today's China than any tract on communist ideology.</p>",
  "A website called Vision of Britain, offering a wealth of information from census returns and elsewhere on the state of the nation past and present, which was launched at lunchtime on Tuesday, was suspended shortly afterwards because it could not cope with demand - a circumstance all the more frustrating because I was planning to ask it this question: was the census of 2001 the first in which no one gave his or her occupation as \"lighthouse keeper\"? <p>On the face of it, the answer should have been \"yes\", since lighthouse keeping in Britain became extinct when the last practitioner made the last journey back from North Foreland lighthouse near Broadstairs six years ago. That ended a history dating back to the middle ages (the oldest surviving lighthouse in Britain and Ireland, Hook Head, was established in 1172), of men, and occasionally women, tramping out with a month's supplies to some lonely outpost, sometimes to be shared with colleagues they didn't get on with, sometimes involving perilous feats of rescue (Grace Darling's at Longstone may be the best known, but she certainly wasn't alone). </p> <p>There are rather more lighthouses scattered around our shores than most people realise. Trinity House - which has run them in England ever since a parliamentary committee in 1834 persuaded the government that the service would not be efficient until they were taken out of private ownership - superintends 71 of them. The Northern Lighthouse Board lists 207 in Scotland and the Commissioners of Irish Lights have 80 both north and south of the border. </p> <p>On the Trinity House website there's a fascinating gallery of pictures of lighthouses under its charge, each with a brief account of its history: some slim and elegant, others squat and aggressive, some sturdy, some apparently frail, some perched on rock ledges with vertiginous drops to the sea, others (like Southwold) in the streets of a town. </p> <p>For lighthouse enthusiasts, of the kind who form the Lighthouse Society of Britain, their architects - the Stevenson family, as commemorated in Bella Bathurst's bestselling book about them, the Douglass brothers, James and William, John Smeaton, James Walker - are as honoured as the Gilbert Scotts and Pugin and JL Pearson among devotees of churches. The Lighthouse Society of Great Britain publishes an annual CD encyclopaedia of structures around the world - 12,000 in 60 countries in the latest edition. </p> <p>But could lighthouses follow their keepers into extinction - made irrelevant, as the keepers were, by the march of technology? Reports which followed the publication at the start of this month of a Trinity House paper called 2020 The Vision generated a crop of alarming stories about their possible loss from the coasts of various counties, particularly in the south-west. </p> <p>Mariners of all kinds tend to depend nowadays on satellite technology rather than ancient devices - perhaps excessively so, a spokesman for Trinity House suggests. The document foresaw a reduction in overall numbers, though it said the role of those that remained was likely to be enhanced. But no casualties are likely in the immediate future, and even where closures occur there is probably little risk that familiar and well-loved landmarks will disappear from the seaside scene. </p> <p>Some, having been decommissioned, have already been redeveloped as visitor centres. Lighthouse keepers' cottages have been snapped up for holiday lettings, and lighthouses may increasingly go that way too. </p> <p>Yet even without demolition, the long romantic, even spiritual, appeal of the lighthouse could, in a crucial sense, be diminished. The darkness-defying beams which since Roman times have been used to warn those at sea of possible imminent peril have also brought hope and comfort to those whose lives are not remotely maritime. They're a kind of physical equivalent of good deeds in a naughty world. </p> <p>Religious groups all over the country opening shops and offices offering counsel and guidance have taken to calling them lighthouses. And that connection is nothing new. The provision of warning lights around our shores to save mariners from death and destruction predates even Hook Head; and those who furnished those lights were often members of religious communities - some of them hermits who had otherwise renounced the works of this world. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:McElsewhere@aol.com\">McElsewhere@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Unilever, the consumer goods group, revealed yesterday that its sales dropped 4% in the past three months, a performance it called \"unacceptably weak\". </p> <p>The results represented a decline even from the figures that prompted a major profits warning last month and caused deep concern among investors over Unilever's competitive strength. </p> <p>At an underlying level - ignoring the effect of disposals - sales were down 1.3% in July, August and September, but the slump in Europe reached 5%. Unilever said the poor weather during the summer was mostly to blame, with sales of ice cream and iced tea hit hardest. Wall's and Lipton are among the group's most important brands. </p> <p>Unilever also suffered in Asia, where it is engaged in an aggressive price war with Procter &amp; Gamble over detergents and hair-care products. Underlying sales in the region were virtually static. In America, where the Slim-Fast food business is still suffering from the Atkins diet craze, sales were also flat. </p> <p>Unilever's joint chairmen, Anthony Burgmans and Patrick Cescau, also alarmed investors yesterday by declaring that they would be reviewing assumptions for the five years to 2010. The financial targets for this period were announced only this year, after the failure to meet the goals of the previous five-year \"path to growth\" strategy. </p> <p>The chairmen's statement hinted at further cost-cutting, price cuts and a heavy increase in spending on advertising. </p> <p>\"We are making adjustments to price points where necessary, stepping up support behind key innovations and increasing media spend for a number of our leading brands. These actions will be sustained into 2005 and we are accelerating the savings programmes.\" </p> <p>Pre-tax profits for the third quarter fell 2% to \u20ac1.32bn (\u00a3916m), but the shares still rose 2.75p to 452.25p as analysts said the results had not been as bad as had been feared. Nevertheless, the share price has fallen 20% since April. </p> <p>The City's biggest concern is the cost to Unilever of reviving sales growth and the group has been accused of under-investing in its brands. </p> <p>Under the former chairman Niall FitzGerald, Unilever's spending was concentrated on the leading 400 brands - such as Hellmann's, Dove and Knorr - but yesterday's figures showed that even leading brands, accounting for 95% of sales, showed a decline in sales of 0.9% in the last quarter. </p>",
  "An ailing Yasser Arafat is expected to be moved from his West Bank compound to an overseas hospital - possibly in Paris or Jordan - later today, according to Palestinian officials. <p>\"It is most likely President Arafat will be transferred abroad for treatment. And it is very likely he will transferred to a hospital in Paris,\" said an official cited by Reuters. </p> <p>Another report said Mr Arafat was expected to be moved to the Jordanian capital, Amman. However, Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said no decision had been made on where Mr Arafat will be taken for further treatment.</p> <p>The Palestinian leader has spent most of the day sleeping and has had difficulty standing and eating, according to aides. Doctors have conducted a battery of tests, but have declined to say what he is suffering from. One unconfirmed report suggested he may have a blood disorder.</p> <p>The seriousness of his condition was underlined by the arrival today of his wife, Suha, in the West Bank. She lives in Paris and has not seen her husband since 2001.</p> <p>If Mr Arafat is moved, it would be the first time he left his Ramallah headquarters since he was confined there by Israel in 2002. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has agreed to permit Mr Arafat to be flown abroad for medical treatment - though it is unclear whether the Palestinian leader would be allowed to return to the West Bank afterwards.</p> <p>Palestinian officials have been trying to play down his health problems, saying he performed prayers before dawn today and ate a light breakfast of cornflakes and milk. </p> <p>A friend of Mr Arafat, Monib al-Masri, told the Agence France Presse news agency that the Palestinian president wanted to tell the world there was no need to worry about his health. \"He prayed and is fully awake,\" Mr al-Masri added.</p> <p>However, another source said Mr Arafat spent most of the day sleeping. When he awoke, he was moved into a wheelchair because he was very weak and could not stand up, the associate told the Associated Press. </p> <p>He said Mr Arafat has been unable to hold down food, and also suffers from diarrhoea. At times, the veteran politician appeared confused, not recognising some of his visitors.</p> <p>The Palestinian president's persistent two-week illness took a sudden turn for the worse last night, when he vomited after eating soup and then collapsed unconscious for about 10 minutes, a bodyguard said. </p> <p>One official said Mr Arafat has created a special committee consisting of Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, his predecessor Mahmoud Abbas, and Salim Zaanoun - the head of the Palestinian National Council - to run the PLO and the Palestinian Authority while he is ill. But Mr Arafat's spokesman denied he had set up any such committee.</p> <p>In Israel, defence officials were meeting today to discuss the consequences of Mr Arafat's possible death. Israel has prepared contingency plans, including how to deal with possible riots and prevent Palestinian attempts to bury their president in Jerusalem. </p> <p>The Israeli daily Haaretz reported today that Israel had marked a possible burial site for Mr Arafat in the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis in the West Bank, and has taken the location of the plot into consideration in planning the route of its West Bank separation barrier. </p> <p>Mr Sharon was meeting his defence minister, Shaul Mofaz. The country's foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, said a Palestinian Authority without Mr Arafat could become a partner for peace. </p> <p>\"We always said we would be willing to talk to a Palestinian leadership that would be willing once and for all to bring an end to the bloodshed,\" Mr Shalom told Israel Radio. </p> <p>Meanwhile, White House spokesman Scott McClellan, travelling in Michigan with US President George Bush, said US officials were monitoring the situation. </p> <p>Reports of Mr Arafat's illness have varied widely over the past two weeks. Palestinian officials said he had the flu, while Israeli officials speculated he might have stomach cancer. Two of his doctors said yesterday that a blood test and a biopsy of tissue from his digestive tract showed no evidence of that. </p> <p>On Tuesday, a hospital official said the Palestinian president was suffering from a large gallstone. The condition was extremely painful but not life-threatening and easily treated, the official said. Israeli officials also speculated that Mr Arafat had suffered a stroke. He has shown symptoms of Parkinson's Disease since the late 1990s. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's health crisis has highlighted how unprepared the Palestinians are for their leader's death, making a chaotic transition period all but inevitable. He has refused to groom a successor, fearing an impatient protege could turn on him. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and killed an eight-year-old Palestinian girl who was on her way to school in a Gaza Strip refugee camp, Palestinian witnesses said. </p> <p>Rania Iyad Aram of the Khan Younis camp was killed by random machine gun fire an army outpost near the neighboring Jewish settlement of Ganei Tal, witnesses said.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life before </strong><br></p> <p>I've always had a slight problem with the term \"local community\". What exactly do people mean by it? I can understand it in the context of living in the countryside, where villages and even towns can more readily define a community's boundaries, but in a city such as London, where I live, it's a little harder to pin down a definition. Is the local community the street or estate you live on? Or is it one of the many other \"links\" people have: the postal code, the local authority, the parish, the train station, the football club, the school catchment area, the supermarket catchment area, the parliamentary constituency, or even the city as a whole?</p> <p>Even if I, somewhat arbitrarily, assume it to mean anyone living within a two-mile radius, I can't really boast much of a track record in working to improve the local community. Instead I can trot out some lame \"I'm-just-too-busy-to-find-time\" excuses: baby to raise, full-time job, that kind of thing. The most I can offer in the way of having any track record in giving time to others, in fact, is that during my sixth-form years I used to help out at the local hospital radio.</p> <p><strong> The ethical audit</strong><br></p> <p>The auditors: <strong> Hannah Berry</strong>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <strong> Mike Childs</strong>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <strong> Renee Elliott</strong>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>\"So what do you do for your local community?\"</p> <p>The question hangs in the air for an uncomfortable period of time.</p> <p>\"Well, I don't do volunteering for the local meals-on-wheels or pull shopping trolleys from canals, if that's what you mean,\" I respond, a little pathetically. \"We haven't lived in the area for too long, but we are getting to know more people. Is that what you mean?\"</p> <p>The auditors ask Jane and I if we vote. Always, we respond.</p> <p>Do we use locally owned and run shops? We probably used to more, but then a Sainsbury's Local opened up nearby.</p> <p>Do we know which councillor represents the ward we live in? No.</p> <p>Does anything about the area you live in annoy you? Beyond the obvious inner-city gripes, such as litter, graffiti, fear of crime and such like, we mention that the acquisition of the school behind our house by property developers concerns us - as it does many other local residents.</p> <p>\"By not getting involved with your local community,\" says Mike, \"you are probably missing out on opportunities to influence what goes on in your area and help shape a community that you want to live in.\"</p> <p>Mike adds that the first step towards feeling more empowered is to engage more with local democracy. \"The quality of life in your local community is very much affected by the actions of your local authority,\" he says. \"But how can you object to, say, plans concerning the redevelopment of the school if you don't even know who to contact about the decision? It has to be said that local authorities don't make it easy for people to comment on plans, or for people to give feedback on the quality of the services they offer. But local councils are getting better at it. If people don't engage with their local councillors and let them know what they think the council is doing well or what it should be doing better, then they cannot really complain when they fail to perform.\"</p> <p>Hannah is keen to get Jane and me to pin down exactly what we think the term \"local community\" really means for us: \"Is it the street you live in, your local friends with similar aspirations, or something else? A central criticism of the 'gentrification' of places like Brixton where you live is that middle-class home-buyers such as yourselves change the nature of the community precisely through their lack of desire to be part of it. Existing residents of a place like Brixton, which is known for its vibrancy, street life, pubs, busy market and multiculturalism, may well resent newcomers who spend no money with local businesses and take little interest in the area. Could you, for example, reverse your shopping habits and visit the supermarket just for items unavailable or unaffordable locally?\"</p> <p>This is a subject that sparks Renee's interest. \"For me, supporting the local community means buying local goods from local, independent stores where possible. Supporting your local economy - whether local means, say, the village, Yorkshire, or even Britain - is good for jobs and the economy of your own region and country. It is best because you're also not travelling unnecessarily.\"</p> <p>But it should go wider than just supporting local shops, says Mike. \"Supporting local services, such as libraries and swimming pools, also gives the clear message that these facilities are needed and wanted by local people.\"</p> <p>Hannah asks us if we buy a local weekly paper to keep abreast of local issues. I say that this is actually a bit of a bugbear of mine as I have searched high and low for a news-agent that will deliver newspapers but all of them say that, despite their best efforts, they can't find anyone who will do a paper round. I say that I would certainly be interested in receiving a local paper if it was delivered, but that it doesn't really cross my mind to pick one up otherwise.</p> <p>\"OK, well why not join the Brixton section of the online Urban 75 forum (<a href=\"http://www.urban75.org\">www.urban75.org</a>)?\" she says. \"When 28 African asylum seekers were stranded locally, Urban 75 members quickly knew and could take over food and blankets and fire off press releases to alert the media.\"</p> <p>Hannah adds that we should ask ourselves the question, \"Who is poor and why?\" \"Global social justice issues play out in Britain's cities as much as on the coffee plantations of Colombia. Are corporate interests displacing people or threatening a way of life? With its slightly fragmented but still strong radical counterculture, Brixton is an ideal place to live if you want to grapple with concepts of power structures, ethics and resistance. You could help, say, groups fighting displacement or support positive eco-initiatives such as community gardens. You should also interrupt racist or classist comments when you come across them.\"</p> <p>Mike says that he took the time before arriving at our house to research how many local groups there were near to us seeking help. \"Local community organisations and charities are often looking for volunteers and for financial support. According to <a href=\"http://www.upmystreet.com\">www.upmystreet.com</a>, there are 60 different charities and voluntary organisations within a mile of your home, so there are plenty of opportunities to get involved.\"</p> <p><strong> Life after</strong><br></p> <p>Neither Jane or I were really sure where to start. Some things sounded as if they should be quite easy to incorporate, such as frequenting more local shops, but the bigger themes such as \"grappling with power structures\" all seemed a little heady for us. We've never really seen ourselves as the grappling type. I might have signed the odd petition if someone in the street asked me, but that's often more out of embarrassment of saying no rather than being sympathetic to their cause per se. I've never been on a march or picketed outside the town hall, for example. In fact, the closest I ever get to the white heat of democracy in action is probably watching Question Time.</p> <p>Much of what the auditors had to say seemed to boil down to urging us to donate some of our time, not to our own needs, but to that of the wider community. Both of us agreed that this was indeed a noble sentiment; it was just a question of finding something, or someone, that might benefit from such a gesture.</p> <p>Then I received an email at work asking for volunteers for community projects near the office. I had seen this email do the rounds before but, even though I had been interested, had never acted on it, even though I knew that 100 or so people in the company take part. But re-reading the email seemed to directly answer one of my biggest concerns: namely, just when was I going to find the time to volunteer when I already struggled to clear any spare time in the day? The answer, as the email pointed out, was to give up my lunch hour once a week, a period of the day that can hardly be said to be the most productive time I spend, considering that it usually amounts to reading sports reports or sitting in the park. So I put my name down to help out with one-to-one reading during the \"Literacy Hour\" at a local primary school.</p> <p>Within a couple of weeks I was attending a training session with Community Service Volunteers (<a href=\"http://www.csv.org.uk\">www.csv.org.uk</a>), the UK's largest volunteer organisation, which oversees the scheme.</p> <p>I was more than a little nervous when it came to the first reading session. Thirty-odd children all looked at me quizzically as they came running in from the playground, no doubt wondering who on earth this tall man standing awkwardly in the corner next to their \"Countries of the World\" wall display was.</p> <p>Alfie was chosen as my first reader and he walked off to the reading corner to choose Where Are You, Blue Kangaroo? as our first book - a book I now know almost by heart. A term later I had been phonetically read the complete repertoire of reading corner with a selection of wonderfully engaging members of class 2P.</p> <p>It sounds a little silly now, but in the first few weeks when I started I used to feel guilty that I was actually enjoying it. I'm not sure why, but I used to feel that volunteering should be about suffering for a cause. It took me a while to learn that it only really works when both parties get something out of it.</p> <p>This school term I started mentoring at a local secondary school where English is a second language for over 50% of pupils - the theory being that I can hopefully guide, in some small way, a 14-year-old through their GCSEs and beyond. The reality was that, on our first encounter, it was me doing the learning: I went back to work knowing how to say \"My name is Leo\" in Bengali.</p> <p><strong>Do try this at home</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Join the 22 million people in the UK who volunteer.

  "<p>Mark Lamarr once described Bill Bailey as \"Darwin's surprise\", and that's one of the kinder things that have been said about him. Perhaps, to borrow the title of this show, he really is \"half troll\". </p> <p>But it hasn't done him any harm. Two decades after Bailey launched himself into comedy, there's no getting away from his scrubby beard and ageing rocker's 'do: on TV, on radio (yes, you can hear the facial hair) and now in London's West End. </p> <p>But he's not about to wear out the welcome. After a low-key, rambling intro that Bailey likens to starting a new roll of toilet paper comes two hours of rare comedic intelligence. </p> <p>Pre-interval, his main theme is cultural difference, from rubbish Britain (\"We are hard-wired for melancholy\") to weird America (\"My mum had never tasted a bagel - or seen a 6ft 4in transvestite\"), via Bali, New Zealand and Australia. He has some great stories about the questions asked at immigration: wildlife-related in Australia (\"How do you feel about grebes?\"), politically obsessed in the US (\"Were you a member of the Nazi government of Germany?\"). Some may even be true. </p> <p>Things get weirder in the second half as \"1987's International Face of Hemp\" meanders through astrophysics, religion, pogonophobia (fear of beards), vegetarianism and, again, the uselessness of the British. There's a bit of coasting on the subject of drugs (he doesn't need the cheap laughs) but that's more than made up for by the songs satirising world events or combining incompatible musical forms, as Bailey flits between keyboards, guitar and theremin. Why, you wonder, has no one else set the \"wisdom\" of George W Bush to drum'n'bass? The stand-out moment, though, is a deadpan German-language Hokey-Cokey, as it might have been performed by Kraftwerk. The more serious Bailey is, the more screamingly funny he becomes. Early in the show, he describes himself as a wizard. He's referring to his looks, but tonight he does magic. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until December 18. Box office: 020-7494 5070.</p>",

  "An Indonesian cleric appeared in court today accused of leading the militant Islamist group responsible for a series of attacks including the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings that killed 202 people. <p>Prosecutors read out a 65-page indictment accusing Abu Bakr Bashir of running Jemaah Islamiyah, a south-east Asian terror network, and of using his \"religious charisma\" to incite followers to carry out attacks.</p> <p>The primary charge against Mr Bashir under the country's anti-terror legislation accuses him of planning the August 2003 suicide bombing of the Marriott hotel in Jakarta, in which 12 people died.</p> <p>A subsidiary charge accuses him of conspiring in the Bali attacks. The indictment alleges that Amrozi bin Nurhasyim, who was later convicted along with 35 other militants in the nightclub bombings, visited Mr Bashir three months before the attacks to ask for his blessing. </p> <p>Mr Bashir faces the death penalty if found guilty in the Marriott attack, or a long prison term if convicted of the Bali-related charges.</p> <p>Charges under the anti-terror law could not be brought against Mr Bashir in connection with the Bali bombings because Indonesia's highest court ruled the statute could not be used retroactively. The law was passed soon after the Bali attacks, in which many foreign tourists - mostly from Australia - were killed. </p> <p>Mr Bashir was not required to make a plea in today's hearing. The trial was adjourned until November 4, when his defence team will present their initial objections to the indictment. </p> <p>About 70 supporters of Mr Bashir shouted \"God is great\" as the 66-year-old cleric arrived at court wearing white robes and a prayer cap and flanked by armed anti-terror police. </p> <p>\"The charges are baseless. Everybody knows, even school children, that there is pressure from George Bush and his slave [the Australian prime minister] John Howard [to hold this trial]. All those people who do not agree with the interests of George Bush are called terrorists,\" he told reporters before the hearing.</p> <p>The trial, expected to last about five months, opened in a large auditorium in the agriculture ministry because of the high number of expected observers. </p> <p>In another trial last year, Mr Bashir was cleared of the terror charges but convicted of immigration violations. The verdict was criticised by the United States and Australia, which have led international calls for Jakarta to put him on trial again. </p> <p>He was re-arrested after completing his sentence in April, and has been in prison ever since. </p> <p>Mr Bashir has little active support in Indonesia, where radical Islam is not popular, but he has received sympathy from some mainstream clerics and government officials who view him as a victim of foreign intervention in the country's internal affairs.</p> <p>The cleric has long campaigned for the introduction of Islamic law in secular Indonesia. He fled to Malaysia in the 1980s to avoid arrest by then-dictator Suharto, who brutally repressed Islamist movements, and returned to Indonesia in 1998.</p>",
  "<p>W hen Indonesian and Australian archaeologists started to excavate a limestone cave on the Indonesian island of Flores, they weren't prepared for what they found, the skeleton of an entirely new species of human, Homo floresiensis, that lived as recently as 18,000 years ago. </p> <p>\"When we first unearthed the skeleton, I was simultaneously gobsmacked, puzzled and amused,\" says geochronologist Bert Roberts of the University of Wollongong. </p> <p>\"We had been looking for the remains of the earliest modern humans in Indonesia, so when we found the skeleton of a completely new species of human, with so many primitive traits and that survived until so recently, it really opened up a whole can of prehistoric worms. The discovery of Homo floresiensis was sweet serendipity.\" </p> <p>Peter Brown, an anthropologist from the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, says: \"I would have been less surprised if someone had uncovered an alien.\" The discovery at Liang Bua cave, described in Nature this week, could alter our outlook on our own place in nature. </p> <p>The discovery raises obvious questions about the diversity of the human family, such as whether undiscovered human-like species might survive today. Are we really the sole human custodians of our planet? Could the existence of Homo floresiensis rehabilitate persistent rumours of undiscovered human-like species elsewhere, notably the orang pendek of Malay folklore? Could cryptozoology come in from the cold? </p> <p>Unlike parts of Indonesia closer to the Asian mainland, far-flung Flores has been an island for at least a million years. As is the case with islands elsewhere, the fauna of Flores evolved in its own way, producing creatures larger or smaller than their mainland relatives: a looking-glass lost world of tiny elephants, giant rats, Komodo dragons and even larger, extinct lizards. </p> <p>This isolation had its effects on the human inhabitants. One of the most surprising things about the skeleton is its size: in life, no more than a metre tall, about the same size as one of the giant rats. Living in a hole in the ground and chased by lizards of mythical proportions, the creature has, perhaps inevitably, been nicknamed \"hobbit\" by some of the researchers - a reference to the tiny hole-dwelling heroes of The Lord of the Rings. </p> <p>For Brown, it was the smallness of the skull that showed that Homo floresiensis was truly different. When he measured the skull volume and found it a chimp-sized 380cc, he says his jaw \"dropped to my knees. Small stature is easy to accommodate, but small brain size is a bigger problem - it still is.\" And yet these tiny-brained creatures were skilled enough to make finely crafted stone tools. </p> <p>The clue to the origin of Homo floresiensis comes from earlier work sug gestive of the presence on Flores of earlier, full-sized prehumans. Michael Morwood, of the University of New England, New South Wales, co-director of the excavation, working closely with his Indonesian counterpart, RP Soejono, of the Indonesian Centre for Archaeology in Jakarta, whose team discovered the skeleton. </p> <p>In the mid-1990s, Morwood and his colleagues unearthed stone tools on the island dating back 800,000 years. The implication was that the toolmakers, presumably Homo erectus, were capable of navigating the open sea. It is possible that once marooned on Flores, a population of Homo erectus set its own evolutionary course, morphing into Homo floresiensis. </p> <p>When a small population of animals is cut off from a parent population for an extended period, it follows its own evolutionary course. Size change is a typical response. Small size is an ad vantage on isolated islands, where resources are scarce, so this might have been what predisposed the inhabitants of Flores towards smallness. </p> <p>It is hard to comprehend the significance of the survival of such a strange species of human until what is, in geological terms, a very recent date. To put this in context, by 18,000 years ago, modern Homo sapiens had been in Indonesia for at least 20,000 years. </p> <p>Chris Stringer, of the Natural History Museum in London, says: \"One of the first things I thought of, on learning about the Flores skeleton, was a possible parallel with the orang pendek [found in Sumatra].\" Bert Roberts offers hints of new discoveries just below the research horizon: \"When I was back in Flores just three weeks ago, Gert van den Bergh [from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research at Texel, and the team's expert on the fossil elephants] and I headed off to a village in central Flores where we heard the most amazing tales of little hairy people whom they called ebu gogo: ebu meaning \"grandmother\" and gogo \"he who eats anything\". </p> <p>\"The ebu gogo were short - about a metre tall - long-haired, pot-bellied, with ears that stuck out, walking with a slightly awkward gait, and had longish arms and fingers. They murmured at each other and could repeat words parrot-fashion. They could climb slender trees but were never seen holding stone tools, whereas we have lots of sophisticated artefacts associated with Homo floresiensis. That's the only inconsistency with the archaeological evidence. Gert had heard of these stories 10 years ago and he thought them no better than leprechaun stories - until we unearthed the hobbit.\" </p> <p>Could the ebu gogo still be alive? Roberts thinks it is possible. \"The villagers said that the last hobbit was seen just before Dutch colonists settled that part of Flores in the 19th century,\" he said, adding that searches of the remaining rainforest on Flores, and the caves specifically associated with the ebu gogo stories, could turn up samples of hair or other material, if not living, breathing specimens. </p> <p>The possibility of finding ebu gogo alive should not be dismissed as fantasy, because mammals unknown to science do still turn up - and South-East Asia is a particular hotspot for such finds. An antelope, Pseudoryx nghetinhensis, from the Lao-Vietnamese border, was described as recently as 1993. An ox-like creature, the kouprey, was discovered in Cambodia in the 1940s. </p> <p>Morwood and Roberts have targets already in their sights. Many Indonesian islands contain peculiar faunas and have deep, barely explored limestone caves. \"Sumba and Sulawesi are high on our hitlist,\" says Roberts. Morwood starts work on Sulawesi next year. </p> <p>A larger theme raised by the discovery concerns the uniqueness of our human heritage, something which, in hindsight, has been in question for decades. Back in the 1960s, the great anthropologist Louis Leakey speculated that the human lineage had been distinct from that of the apes for 20m years or so. In the 1970s, extinct ape-like primates such as Ramapithecus, living around 10-20m years ago, were presumed to lie on the human lineage. But this consensus swept into reverse with the discovery that Ramapithecus was more akin to orang-utans - and molecular evidence showing that the DNA of humans and chimpanzees were so similar that a separation of more than 3-5m years was ruled out. </p> <p>But opinions have, slowly, been changing back. The force has come from the discoveries of extinct members of the human lineage of ever greater antiquity. Ardipithecus ramidus, discovered in Ethiopia in the mid-1990s by Tim White of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues, put back the human-chimp divergence to at least 4.4m years ago. If this put the molecular evidence under strain, it was snapped by the discovery in Chad by Michel Brunet of the University of Poitiers, France, and colleagues of \"Touma\u00ef\" - Sahelanthropus tchadensis, a member of the human lineage that could be as old as 7m years. Louis Leakey has been partially vindicated, with the effect that our own complacency at our distinctiveness with respect to the animal world has been reinforced. </p> <p>By the same token, evidence for the diversity of human species through time has been downplayed, first by the cultural inertia of stories of an upwards progression towards the human state; second, by the curious chance that Homo sapiens happens to be the only species of human around today - a situation probably unprecedented in 7m years. The evidence for the coexistence of humans and Neanderthals in Europe for at least 10,000 years until Neanderthals disappeared around 30,000 years ago, and the fact that anthropologists have known for years of the multiple lineages of prehumans living in Africa between 4-2m years -has done little to dent the robust idea that humans are so distinct from the rest of the animal world that they rule the earth by virtue of inherent perfection, or divine fiat. </p> <p>The Flores finds could change all that with a single stroke. </p> <p>For one thing, they underscore the fact of human diversity until very recent times. \"Maybe little folk from Flores will hammer the point home more effectively because they are so different in anatomy but so close in time,\" says Tim White. \"How will the creationists cope?\" </p> <p>For another, the evidence challenges the human-centric idea that humans characteristically modify their surroundings to suit themselves, rather than allowing natural selection to adapt them to their environment. If the Flores skeleton is evidence of the kind of evolutionary size change more associated with animals such as rats and elephants, this, says Brown \"is a clear indicator\" of human-like creatures \"behaving like all other mammals in terms of their interactions with the environment\". </p> <p>\"Darwin and Wallace would be pleased,\" adds Tim White. \"What better demonstration that humans play by the same evolutionary rules as other mammals?\" </p> <p>Of perhaps more current concern to anthropologists is the degree to which Homo floresiensis, with its small stature and - especially - tiny brain, will force a redefinition of humanity, at least in terms of anatomy. \"I think the discovery challenges the very notion of what it is to be human,\" says Stringer. </p> <p>\"Here is a creature with a brain the size of a chimpanzee's, but apparently a tool-maker and hunter, and perhaps descended from the world's first mariners. Its very existence shows how little we know about human evolution. I could never have imagined a creature like this, living as recently as this.\" </p> <p>Russell Ciochon, a paleoanthropologist from the University of Iowa, says: \"I suspect that creationists will act very negatively toward this discovery. </p> <p>\"It shows that humans were not alone. There may be other dwarfed species lurking in the caves of other isolated islands. Each new discovery will subtract some essence from the uniqueness of humans. I wonder if this discovery might even be discussed in our current political campaign? It is no secret that Bush is anti-evolution. If he is smart, he will not touch this one.\" </p> <p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p> <p> <strong> Fission-track ages of stone tools and fossils on the east Indonesian island of Flores</strong> by MJ Morwood, PB O'Sullivan and A Raza, Nature vol 392, pp173-176 (1998) Earlier evidence that Homo erectus crossed open sea to reach the remote island of Flores </p> <p><strong> New ages for human occupation and climatic change at Lake Mungo, Australia</strong> by James M Bowler and colleagues, Nature vol. 421, pp837-840 (2003) </p> <p><strong> A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa</strong> by Michel Brunet and colleagues, Nature vol 418, 145-151 (2002)</p>",
  "<p>When a company goes into liquidation, its ordinary customers stand very little chance of getting their money back. The consumer is classed as an unsecured creditor, and has to go to the back of the queue when the company's few remaining assets are distributed.</p> <p>Hundreds of newlywed couples discovered this recently, when the company with which they had placed their wedding list went into liquidation.</p> <p>Several readers wrote to Guardian Unlimited Money about the now defunct Gift Registry, devastated to find out the firm had gone bust. One couple said they had used the service only because it allowed them to draw up a list from more than one supplier. Now they have lost gifts and gift vouchers worth over \u00a32,000.</p> <p>The Gift Registry told customers to ask any wedding guest who purchased gifts through them with their credit card to lodge a claim for a refund with the credit card company. This might be embarrassing, but it is good advice. In fact, the best way to protect yourself from a company going bust is to pay by credit card.</p> <p>Under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 the card company is equally responsible for the suppliers' breach of contract or misrepresentation caused by insolvency, as long as the cost of the goods or services is between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000.</p> <p>And it's the price of the goods or services that matter, not the amount you pay. So you get the protection of Section 75 even if you pay only the deposit by card - as long as the full price of the goods or services is between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000.</p> <p>So whether you're buying a car, a holiday or having building work done the message is simple. If you pay the whole amount or even the deposit by credit card you will be protected if the supplier goes bust since you can recover your losses from the credit card company.</p> <p>And you may be entitled to compensation over and above the amount of the transaction. For example, if your holiday is cut short because the tour operator has gone bust, you could claim not only what you paid for the holiday but also a sum to compensate for your loss of enjoyment. </p> <p>There are some loopholes to watch out for, though. Your right to claim against the card company only exists if you use a credit card such as Visa or Mastercard. Not all payments by plastic are covered. So you won't be protected if you use charge cards such as American Express or Diners Club, or debit cards such as Switch. </p> <p>Bear in mind that only the main cardholder is protected. So if you get an additional card for your partner, say, the goods or services he or she buys won't normally be covered by the compensation rule. You can get round this only by insisting that all cardholders are principal cardholders when your credit cards are issued. </p> <p>And as the Consumer Credit Act came into force on July 1, 1977 protection doesn't apply if a credit card was issued before that date, even if it has been replaced several times since then. Access and Barclaycard were the sole issuers at that time and they have agreed to accept liability on pre-1977 cards but only up to the amount of the transaction. To get full protection you'll need to cancel your pre-1977 card and apply for a new one.</p> <p>Moreover, make sure your payment is made direct to the supplier and not to an agent otherwise you won't be protected if the supplier goes bust. So if you're paying for a holiday by credit card insist the card payment is made to the tour operator not the travel agent. If you book through an Association British Travel Agents (ABTA) travel agent you can use a special form to ensure this happens.</p> <p>It's always a good idea to use an established supplier who belongs to a recognised trade association. Trade associations such as ABTA organise bonding schemes guaranteeing your protection if one of its members goes bust. If an ABTA tour operator goes under while you are travelling abroad with them you will be brought back at no extra cost usually at the end of your holiday. And if you've booked and paid but not yet travelled you get a full refund.</p> <p>If you're having double glazing installed use a company that belongs to the Glass and Glazing Federation (GGF). Under its deposit indemnity fund, your deposit will be protected if the company goes bust. The GGF will arrange for the work to be completed or return your deposit up to \u00a32,500.</p> <p>To protect yourself from a builder going bust remember that 10% is a reasonable maximum advance payment. You can set up the deal so that you pay in stages as the work progresses when you can see something for your money. It's also a good idea to pick a builder who offers an insurance backed guarantee scheme, but get full documentation of the cover before you give the final go-ahead. </p> <p>If you're shopping online, then use sites you know and look for those linked to Trust UK, Which?, Web Trader or the Interactive Media in Retail Group (MRG) since these provide accreditation and have agreed to adhere to strict trading standards.</p> <p>Whatever you are buying, and wherever you are shopping, take precautions to protect yourself from a company's potential financial problems, or you could find yourself at the end of a very long queue of disgruntled creditors.</p>",

That process has been dominated by machismo. Post-9/11 America has put tough leadership at the centre of the election debate. </p> <p>As long ago as May 2003, when Bush was photographed in full helicopter pilot garb declaring an end to fighting in Iraq on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, the intention was clear. He was tough, he was in command; he was also premature. </p> <p>In fact, Kerry's campaign has made more use of such images than Bush's. His team has tried to create a patriotic and heroic appeal by playing on their man's military record in Vietnam. </p> <p>But consumers - or voters - buy brands with which they most closely identify. Hence, a rush of photocalls intended to portray both candidates as regular American guys. The reality is that both come from privileged backgrounds light years from most of the voters whose support they court. But that's why Bush hunts, fishes and plays golf; it's why Kerry has ridden a Harley, played ice hockey and piloted a plane. It's why Bush wears rugged outdoor clothing and why Kerry sometimes looks like an extra from a Gap ad. </p> <p>In pure marketing terms, Bush has had the better of things. His proposition is simple: security, decisiveness and patriotism wrapped up in homespun Texan humour. Kerry has failed to create a brand that can be distilled into such populist terms. He's been too complex. </p> <p>If advertising is \"the art of separating a fool from his money\", more than a few Americans I know believe their country may be fooled again next week. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Howard Robinson is client services director of Eulogy! a London PR consultancy.</p>",
  "Michael Howard was accused yesterday of coming close to playing the race card in a new Conservative party housing strategy which blames immigration for creating a shortage of accommodation in the south of England. <p>In an uncharacteristically robust response to the Conservative party leader, the National Housing Federation said the opposition was playing a dangerous game by making wildly misleading claims without any substance. </p> <p>Although the 40-page strategy document - The Right to Own; Action on Housing - highlights the case for selling 1m housing association homes to tenants at knockdown prices, its claims on immigration shocked housing professionals. </p> <p>With the number of immigrants at 158,000 a year, the Conservatives claim the effect of immigration on housing demand \"is much more significant than other drivers, such as relocation from the north to the south of England\". </p> <p>But without providing any qualification, the strategy adds controversially: \"Some analysts believe that the implications of government figures on net immigration, housing stock and house building make it the single most significant factor affecting demand.\" </p> <p>Jim Coulter, chief executive of the federation, which represents housing associations, accused the Conservatives of \"coming close to playing the race card\". </p> <p>He added: \"Their comments, without any figures to back them up, are underhand, inappropriate and completely wrong.\" </p> <p>The hardening Tory line on immigration and housing, already worrying moderate elements in the party, is clearly seen as a way of shoring up a traditional vote and countering a threat from the UK Independent party, which overtook the Conservatives in the recent Hartlepool byelection. </p> <p>Yesterday's report implied that placing an annual limit on the number of people allowed into Britain would reduce the demand for social housing. </p> <p>Although social house building is the lowest for many years, extending the right-to-buy to 1m housing association tenants is seen by the leadership as a popular proposal for middle and lower income families, particularly in London and parts of the south where many are priced out of the market. </p> <p>In what has been labelled the biggest privatisation of all, more than 1.5m council houses have already been sold at a cost of almost \u00a32bn since Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy in the early 80s, with a maximum discount of \u00a350,000. </p> <p>Criticising the government for reducing the discount to \u00a316,000 - and extending a payback period for its repayment from three to five years if an owner moves on - the Tories implied yesterday that they would reintroduce hugely discounted sales. </p> <p>They also promised to give \"transferable discounts\" to allow social housing tenants to shop around for the home of their choice, rather than one they were currently renting. </p> <p>This raised the question of the cost to the public purse of providing the discounts, and the wider impact - along with an extended right to buy - on the finances of housing associations. </p> <p>Some professionals feel the strategy has wide implications for associations because it would not only reduce their rental income but also their capacity to borrow based on rental streams. </p> <p>Although the Tories say proceeds from house sales would be ploughed back into new building, they acknowledge that only one new home could be provided for every two sold because of the discounts and the high cost of land. </p> <p>But Mr Howard said they were determined to change the culture of housing, with more and more people finding it increasingly difficult to get on the housing ladder. </p> <p>\"We need practical policies to put a home within their reach,\" he added. \"Some people think the answer is to build more houses, and we certainly do need more homes, with the level of building at its lowest since the war. But what we emphatically don't want is simply to concrete over the country with millions of homes on unwilling communities.\"</p>",
  "<p>Most Londoners would pay higher bus fares if the capital's transport improved dramatically, according to a survey. </p> <p>The Mori poll suggests that Ken Livingstone's strategy, pain now for gain later, has not triggered the uproar many predicted. But the tactic has split the electorate. </p> <p>While 43% of respondents said that they were prepared to take the mayor's plan on trust, 38% were not. Another 12% said other factors might determine their decision, while 7% did not know. </p> <p>Mr Livingstone has warned that there may be three years of fares rising 10% above inflation to repay the \u00a32.8bn the government has allowed him to borrow to upgrade the transport system. </p> <p>The survey, commissioned by the mayor to gauge attitudes on a variety of issues, shows that a number of eye-catching policies have struck a chord. </p> <p>Mr Livingstone's fierce criticism of motorists who drive 4x4s is endorsed. </p> <p>Some 62% of the 1,000 Londoners questioned said that sports utility vehicles, or SUVs, should be discouraged in the capital; 30% disagreed or strongly disagreed. </p> <p>The \"low emission zone\" plan, banning the most polluting buses, taxis, coaches, and lorries from entering Greater London, also wins approval - 66% support or strongly support it; 24% oppose it to some degree. </p> <p>Many Londoners said they remained concerned about crime. </p> <p>Asked to assess their own personal experiences, 51% said that their personal standard of living was getting better, but 69% said crime was getting worse. </p> <p>Respondents also noted a deterioration, on balance, in hospitals, schools, and the extent to which they were taxed. Some 82% complained that housing costs were worsening, but 46% thought transport was getting better - compared with 44% who did not. </p> <p>There was also comfort for the highly publicised, expensive and controversial policing policy, Safer Neighbourhoods, which will see each of London's wards served by a permanent team of officers. </p> <p>Respondents said that they had noticed more officers on patrol in their boroughs and across London, and confirmed that they believed a visible presence reduced anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>Crime topped the list of concerns, followed by the state of the National Health Service. Issues such as immigration and asylum, education, and terrorism also weigh on Londoners' minds, as does the conflict in Iraq. </p> <p>The one thing most seem sanguine about is the economy. Only 10% saw it as a cause for concern and 72% believed it was in good shape.</p>",
  "Ariel Sharon brushed aside threats to bring down his government from four cabinet ministers yesterday who have said they will resign unless he holds a referendum on the removal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip and a section of the West Bank. <p>The Israeli prime minister told the newspaper Ha'aretz that he was standing by his refusal to call a referendum on his \"unilateral disengagement plan\" because it would be divisive and delay the pullout by a year. </p> <p>\"I will never give in to pressures and threats, and I won't accept any ultimatums,\" he said. \"My position on the referendum is unchanged. I am opposed because it will lead to terrible tensions and a rift among the public.\" </p> <p>An Israeli newspaper opinion poll published yesterday shows that half the voters favour a referendum and 59% would vote to pull out of Gaza if one were held. </p> <p>Shortly after the Israeli parliament voted on Tuesday to back the withdrawal plan, the four ministers said they would resign in a fortnight if there was no referendum. </p> <p>They are led by the prime minister's chief rival in the ruling Likud party, Binyamin Netanyahu, the finance minister, who could decide to use his resignation to launch a leadership challenge against Mr Sharon. </p> <p>Mr Netanyahu and the other ministers backed disengagement in the parliamentary vote but came close to abstaining until the prime minister threatened to sack them. </p> <p>Mr Sharon may not be disappointed to see the ministers go. It is widely considered that he will have to form a new coalition in the coming weeks because Likud has split over the plan. His most attractive partner is the opposition Labour party, which strongly opposes Mr Netanyahu's austere economic policies. </p> <p>If the four ministers leave their posts it would remove a major obstacle to the opposition joining the government and save Mr Sharon the political grief of having to fire some ministers from his own party to make way for Labour ministers. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> About 40 Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles moved into the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin yesterday, exchanging fire with Palestinian militants. There were no initial reports of injuries. </p> <p>Military officials said that the raid was intended to root out Palestinian militants in the camp and was expected to last several days. Israel has frequently raided West Bank towns and refugee camps during the past four years of the fighting.</p>",
  "Homemade village cinemas in the north have won almost a fifth of a National Lottery handout to buy projectors, screens and even ice-cream trays in remote communities. <p>The regional share of \u00a3500,000 will bring new films such as My Summer Of Love into venues including the large metal shed at the hamlet of Appleton-le-Moors, 10 miles from the nearest cinema in Pickering, North Yorkshire. </p> <p>The newly formed Film Village Society has been given \u00a3841.32 for a screen and speaker system for the shed, built in 1911 as a reading room annexe to the village hall to discourage farm labourers from drinking in the pub. </p> <p>\"It was very popular because they put a snooker table in there as well,\" said Henry Iles, of the Appleton Film Society. \"We had a survey earlier this year under the national Vital Villages scheme and the thing which people said they'd most like to see in Appleton was somewhere to watch films.\" </p> <p>The resulting 32-seat mini-cinema, just waiting for its fire and safety licence before renting its first reels, is typical of successful bids for the lottery money, says the UK Film Council which allocated the money. The 81 successful clubs promise to remedy a growing imbalance in cinema-going between London, which accounts for 26% of national film visits, and regions such as the north-east (3.7%) and the Scottish borders (1%). </p> <p>\"The scheme will mean more people can enjoy films as they were meant to be seen - on a big screen with an audience,\" said Pete Buckingham, head of distribution and exhibition at the film council. \"Big budget blockbusters like Troy and Harry Potter as well as new and challenging film-making from home and abroad, such as Touching the Void and Goodbye Lenin!, will now be available to new audiences throughout the UK.\" </p> <p>The bulk of the \u00a3100,000 grants made to northern societies, from Lytham St Anne's Film Society to Haltwhistle Film Project, will be spent on mobile digital projectors, capable of bringing the visual and sound effects of big cinemas to village hall screens. </p> <p>\"We want everyone to come along,\" said Mr Iles, a graphic designer planning a Yorkshire season of films. Classics already booked include Winifred Holtby's South Riding, and starring the young Ralph Richardson, as well as recent titles such as Calendar Girls which, until the grants, Yorkshire Dales villagers were almost as likely to appear in as extras, as to see on the screen.</p>",
  "<p><strong>A conscience</strong> <br>Lucy Lytton, hydrogeologist, Oxfam <br> Lucy Lytton went further than most to get her degree - to the University of New South Wales - where she took applied geology in the hope it would equip her for humanitarian work. </p> <p>It was while working for the New South Wales state government that she got her big break. </p> <p>\"I saw a notice on the wall for hydrogeologists to go to South Africa and I jumped at the chance,\" she says. </p> <p>During the three-month stint, she helped drill bore holes so local people could extract vital groundwater. \"In so many of these areas, water is often the most important thing,\" she says. </p> <p>Lucy is now a hydrogeologist with Oxfam, heading up a drilling team at the charity's base in Hadjer Hadid, Chad. When we called, her team was about to do a pump test on a new borehole. \"Once we've done that, we can advise Oxfam on the right pump to supply,\" she says. </p> <p>Drilling new boreholes has made it possible to provide water for refugee camps in the area, transforming the lives of those taken there.

His job allowed him to complete a PhD and then he won a five-year research fellowship with the Marine Biological Association. \"That was my big break,\" he says. \"It let me work on exactly what I was interested in.\" It also brought him diving trips to the Azores. As well as frequent trips to Antarctica and southern islands such as the Falklands and South Georgia, Alex has also dived in New Zealand, Bali and is a regular on research cruises to exotic locations such as the equatorial Atlantic and not so exotic spots such as the deep North Sea. </p> <p>We interrupted Alex \"genotyping Patagonian toothfish\" in his Cambridge laboratory - analysing the DNA from fin clippings to better understand the different species for fish stock management.

His big break arrived when he overheard a Nobel prize winning physicist at Stanford University telling his then boss about the discovery of a subatomic particle called the tau neutrino. Three days later, Tom sold the nugget as a news story to New Scientist, his first freelance piece. \"It gave me confidence and allowed me to say I was a science journalist,\" he says. </p> <p>His most satisfying moment? \"I think that would be successfully talking for a minute and a half with out screwing up about Beagle 2's landing.

The job, he insists, is not all glamour. </p> <p>Still, if that hasn't put you off, here is Tom's advice for budding television journalists: \"Don't ever think you're not good enough. Journalism is very competitive but a lot of people don't give it a go because they think it's something they can't do.\" </p> <p><strong>Prizes</strong> <br>Tim Hunt, scientist, Cancer Research UK<br> After studying natural sciences at Cambridge University, a course he describes as \"one of the very few in the world where you don't have to decide what type of scientist you want to be on day one,\" Tim Hunt, 61, held a string of research posts, the first of which paid around \u00a3750 a year. Life was about to get a lot rosier though. In 2001, Hunt shared the Nobel prize for medicine -worth \u00a3640,000 and a lot of kudos - with another Brit, Sir Paul Nurse and Leland Hartwell, a scientist in the US. \"My big break was actually not having a job. It gave me total freedom to do whatever I wanted to do, and I happened to make a discovery that won the Nobel prize,\" he says. </p> <p>Hunt has not seen much of the lab since being awarded the prize for research into cell regulators - he identified a protein called cyclin, which plays a key role in controlling cell growth and division. We caught him at the baggage carousel, on his return from giving a lecture in the US. \"I've been jetting around the world since 2001 and I'm getting very tired of it. I've only just started getting back into the lab and it's great.\" </p> <p>His advice for ambitious scientists? \"The really difficult thing is identifying the most important problem you can solve in a reasonable period of time. Then just follow your nose and keep your feet firmly planted on the ground.\" </p> <p><strong>Cash</strong> <br>Tom Weideg, former investment banker <br> Tom Weideg, 31, took a long route through academia before landing his job as an analyst at Bear Stearns, an American investment bank with offices at Canary Wharf in London. </p> <p>He says that his degree in theoretical physics from the University of Kent at Canterbury, followed by postgraduate work at Imperial College, Durham and Cambridge, was a perfect background for his subsequent work in finance. </p> <p>\"There are two ways of getting into banking,\" he says. \"Either the graduate recruitment scheme, which is extremely difficult - there are 1,000 applicants for perhaps 40 places - or to be an expert in something.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, he says that the job itself was not particularly satisfying, but the starting salary (nearly \u00a335,000 a year) definitely was. </p> <p>But Tom's advice for budding financial gurus urges some caution on this. \"They shouldn't look at the salary, they should look at the lifestyle,\" he says. The relentless workload could perhaps be too much for some people. </p> <p>The day we talk to Tom, he is taking some rare time off. He left Bear Stearns several years ago to work as a consultant to the European Investment Fund and is now writing a book on finance - he had delivered his final draft the night before. </p> <p>\"For the last three years, at this time I would be sitting in front of a computer, looking at spreadsheets,\" he says. Today, at lunchtime, he has just woken up.</p>"
