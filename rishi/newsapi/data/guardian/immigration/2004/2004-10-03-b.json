  "<p>The number of families taking a skiing holiday has increased in recent years to the point where demand is outstripping supply. The crucial factor for many is no longer where but when to take school-age children to the snow. Indeed, if you were hoping to go to the Alps over the new year or at the February half term, a call to any of the 20 or so tour operators specialising in family skiing will leave you wondering whether you are going to be able to take them at all. </p> <p>Christmas falls on a Saturday this year, which means some operators are offering 10-day or weekday departure holidays to prevent people having to travel on Christmas Day. </p> <p>Nigel Purkhardt, owner of Ski Peak of Grayshott in Surrey, says: 'Half term and new year are selling very well indeed but there is still quite a bit of accommodation left for Christmas. We're offering Tuesday to Tuesday holidays, which seem to be popular.' </p> <p>If you're not quite sure when the February half term falls in most places, just glance at any of the 150 ski tour operators' brochures and pick the costliest weeks. </p> <p>A chalet chosen at random in Courchevel 1850 costs \u00a3736 for the week beginning 5 February and shoots up to \u00a31,013 on 12 February (half-term week) and at new year. </p> <p>The inflated cost of European ski holidays at half term and the new year is due to the increasing polarisation of the dates termed as high and low season. For UK chalet operators, school holiday periods are easy to sell. Term-time weeks in January and March are harder to shift. </p> <p>The tour operators' argument is that for weeks where demand outstrips supply, they are entitled to make as much money as possible to make up for a shortfall on low-season dates. </p> <p><strong> Going it alone</strong><br> </p> <p> One way to get around this is by organising your own holiday and cutting out the tour operator altogether. The peak season premiums charged by tour operators are not always reflected in the price of accommodation. </p> <p>For example, the Hotel Belvedere (00 41 27 783 1114, <a href=\"http://www.le-belvedere.ch\">le-belvedere.ch</a> in the small resort of Champex-Lac near Verbier in Switzerland keeps the same prices throughout the season charging SFr 100 ( \u00a345) per person per night half board, regardless of dates. Alternatively, the Hotel Cavallino Bianco (00 39 0471 783 333, <a href=\"http://www.cavallino-bianco.com\">cavallino-bianco.com</a>) in Ortisei, in the Italian South Tyrol has exceptional child facilities but no UK tour operator goes there. On 12 February the price for one week's full board staying in a family room is \u20ac163 (about \u00a3111) per adult and \u20ac40-\u20ac80 per child. On low-season 8 January the prices are \u20ac132 per adult and \u20ac25-\u20ac65 for a child. </p> <p>Booking low-cost flights, car hire or transfers online and organising childcare through the local tourist board may result in a considerable saving, but your investment will not necessarily be secure in the event of an unforeseen problem such as overbooking, nor will you have the services of a tour operator's staff in the resort. </p> <p>A number of specialist companies can tailor a package to your requirements. These include Momentum Ski (020 7371 9111, <a href=\"http://www.momentumski.com\">momentumski.com),</a> Made To Measure (01243 533333, <a href=\"http://www.mtmhols.co.uk\">mtmhols.co.uk</a>), Ski Solutions A La Carte (020 7471 7777, <a href=\"http://www.skisolutions.com\">skisolutions.com</a>), and White Roc (020 7792 1188, <a href=\"http://www.whiteroc.co.uk\">whiteroc.co.uk</a>). </p> <p>Whoever you decide to travel with, taking small children on a skiing holiday requires detailed planning and considerable luck. But the overall success is almost entirely dependent on choosing the right place to stay. France is the most popular country for British families. It has some of the best equipped cr\u00e8ches in Europe, but staff surliness and the 'you are here to learn' attitude of some ski schools leaves a lot to be desired. </p> <p>Switzerland can be more expensive but it offers efficiency and traditional villages full of atmosphere. </p> <p>Avoid Italy if you're taking small children, as many resorts (Ortisei is an exception) do not offer childcare due to the Italian penchant for having nanny - or granny - in tow on the family holiday. </p> <p>Austria is pretty and jolly, but the nursery slopes are often too low to be reliable for snow. </p> <p><strong> Dodging the crowds</strong><br> </p> <p> There are several ways to minimise the inconvenience of the half term and new year crowds. The first is to choose a resort with a really modern lift system (Les Trois Vall\u00e9es) that can cope with large numbers swiftly and efficiently. The second is to opt for a lesser-known resort (Vaujany or La Tania), which is part of a bigger ski area. The third is to go for a resort off the beaten track (Neustift). </p> <p>North America provides a less frenetic alternative at any time of the year and is number one when it comes to childcare. </p> <p>Nothing can beat the enthusiastic welcome your child will receive and the advantage of tuition in your native language outweighs almost everything else. </p> <p><strong>Six great family resorts</strong> </p> <p><strong>Neustift, Austria</strong><br> </p> <p> Attractive Neustift is Europe's first Disney-franchised ski resort. Mickey Mouse and other life-sized cartoon characters stroll around the village and slopes, kids' bedding is themed, and children receive Disney gifts. The nursery slopes are in the village centre, while parents have excellent and varied skiing on the Stubai Glacier. </p> <p><strong> The cost: </strong> half term \u00a3899 in Chalet Hofer which contains 10 family suites, each sleeping between four and six people. It has a nursery staffed by British nannies for children aged from four months to three years, costing \u00a3170 for six days. Five mornings at ski school for kids aged from three to 12 costs \u00a3125. Five sessions at an afternoon activity club are \u00a3140.

After a few days on the nursery slope, improving skiers can cover immense distances on green and blue runs. As well as the Ecole du Ski Fran\u00e7ais and Magic in Motion, the resort has a handful of British-run ski schools including New Generation, Ski Principles, and Parallel Lines. </p> <p><strong> The cost: </strong> new year (from 26 December) \u00a31,009pp at Chalet Jacques (sleeps 8/9), 50m from the chairlift in M\u00e9ribel Village. Snowline's shuttle service takes children to and from ski school. Private nanny \u00a3475 for up to two children for five-and-a-half days.

Until recently, the resort's antiquated Swiss Ski School and ancient lift system meant it wasn't the obvious family choice. But that has changed since the resort upgraded its lift system, and improvements continue. The relative newcomer (this is the fifth season) is Stoked the Ski School, which has a children's ski school and Snowflakes Kids Club at the top of the Matterhorn Express at Schwarzsee. It accepts children aged three to eight years on a flexible basis. </p> <p>As luxurious as the resort itself is tour operator Scott Dunn, whose nannies come to your chalet or hotel bringing toys, books and crafts materials. They take your child out for walks and hot chocolate, cook a wholesome lunch, bring little ones up the mountain to meet you and take older children to and from ski school. </p> <p><strong> The cost: </strong> half term (13 February) \u00a31,545 in Chalet Aroleid (sleeps 6).

The large ski area covers two mountains with an impressive network of trails, including an easy run from the top of every major lift. </p> <p><strong> The cost: </strong> half term \u00a32,350 for a family of four in a family room at Deer Lodge. Meals are not included.

Ski Safari 01273 223680; <a href=\"http://www.skisafari.com\">skisafari.com</a> </p> <p><strong>Avoid holiday clashes</strong></p> <p>Choose your ski-break dates with care this year. An early Easter (Sunday 27 March) makes the 2004-5 season shorter than usual. Regardless of snow conditions, most tour operators start to wind up their programme after this holiday. The majority of UK state schools start their break on Good Friday, and it is worth remembering that the second of the two school-break weeks is by far the most popular for skiing. </p> <p>February half-term falls early, with most schools in England and Wales opting again for the same week: the one starting Saturday 12 February. For once, the timing does not clash with either the Paris school break (19 Feb-7 Mar) or President's Day Weekend, America's biggest winter bank holiday (19 -21 Feb). This means slopes shouldn't be too crowded in the main resorts of the French Alps and North America.</p> <p>However, the half-term dates do clash with the spring break for Lyon and Grenoble, which could result in long lift queues in popular resorts in the French Alps. At the same time, in Andorra and the Pyrenees, an influx of families from Toulouse will augment the number of snow-users.</p> <p>Avid American skiers tend to spend the rest of their President's Day bank holiday week on the slopes, which also has a knock-on effect on Canadian resorts.</p> <p>To compound the difficulty of organising your ski holiday, Christmas Day and New Year's Day both fall on Saturday, the traditional change-over day, forcing some operators to offer either weekday travel or 10-day breaks over the period.</p> <p><strong>Extracted from The Good Skiing and Snowboarding Guide 2005</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Felice Hardy is co-author of The Good Skiing &amp; Snowboarding Guide 2005, published by Which?

  "<p><strong>Letter of the week</strong></p> <p><strong>We have arranged a two-week holiday in the Gambia early next year, and want to visit children we sponsor in Senegal. The charity has offices in Dakar, from which we understand the visit will be arranged. Please suggest how we get there from the Gambia. We need to have all the arrangements in place before we leave.</strong><br> Richard Horsfall and Pat Priestley, by email </p> <p>Transport connections are cheap and good between the Gambia and Senegal, and few travellers fly. </p> <p>As with most long distance travel in West Africa, you're at the mercy of unpredictable services and unreliable vehicles. Allow plenty of time in case you hit delays, be flexible and keep cool if things go wrong. </p> <p>Whether you're in Gambia's Atlantic coast resorts or in the capital Banjul, getting to Dakar means taking the ferry across the mouth of the Gambia River to Barras. This ferry runs from roughly dawn to dusk daily, and the trip takes between 30 minutes and an hour. You buy tickets before boarding and the cost is less than \u00a31 for you both. </p> <p>If you can get to Barras before 9am and are quick off the boat, there's usually an express bus to Dakar. This takes between five and six hours and costs around \u00a31.50 each. </p> <p>If you're slower, there's a bus which takes roughly two hours longer and leaves when it's full. If these buses have no room, or are not running, you need to get to the border at Karang, which is a bush taxi ride away. From there you'll have a choice of taxi, minibus or bus to Dakar. </p> <p>On this journey, be prepared for the hustlers and touts who congregate around Barras ferry terminal. It's a good idea to sound out your fellow ferry passengers and check the details of your route to ensure you are not misled by anyone. </p> <p><strong> I am going to New York for two weeks later this month. I have been twice before and I am wondering if there are any good day trips that do not require hiring a car. I may be too late to book for sports events this time, but for future reference what is the best way to get tickets? Is there an agency you could recommend?</strong><br> Eoghan Beecher, Dublin </p> <p> Though you've seen the highlights of Manhattan, there's still a lot to explore. Plenty of day trips can be made without leaving the Metro, from Coney Island's faded grandeur to Rockaway Beach's boardwalks, perfect for strolling at any time of year. </p> <p>Less well known subway excursions include taking a picnic to Pelham Bay Park, an enormous stretch of Bronx parkland; and Fort Tryon in the far north of Manhattan Island. This recently rejuvenated park is home to The Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's medieval extension. </p> <p>A great way to spend a day is hopping on and off the 7 Subway Line, designated as a National Historic Trail due to the historic immigrant area it passes through. Finish this trip at Shea Stadium, exploring the 1964 World's Fair site. </p> <p>If you want to escape the Big Apple, Long Island is easily accessible by train, and during the summer months ferries connect with rail services to link up attractive parts of South Shore. </p> <p>Alternatively, ride the Long Island Railroad to Montauk, a laid-back town with shifting dunes that's great for cycling, kayaking and exploring. </p> <p>There are hundreds of other great day trips, including the beautiful rural towns and accessible state parks of the lower Hudson Valley. The website <a href=\"http://www.iloveny.com\">iloveny.com</a> has more on the city and state. </p> <p>It's best to book sports tickets on each team's own website. It's generally possible to get baseball tickets, but those for American football, hockey and basketball are scarce. Craigslist (<a href=\"http://www.craigslist.org\">craigslist.org)</a> is a good source of tickets for popular fixtures. Expect to pay a little above face value. </p> <p><strong> I read in Escape last year about a system of cycle routes on disused railway tracks in southern Spain. I'd like more information, as I plan to be in the area for a month or so soon.</strong> <br> Isabel de Sudea, by email </p> <p>Spain has almost 800 miles of Vias Verdes, or Green Ways. Designed for walkers and cyclists, they are mostly disused railway tracks on reasonably level gradients. </p> <p>If your Spanish is good, you can find information on the Vias Verdes website (<a href=\"http://www.ffe.es/viasverdes/index.html\">ffe.es/viasverdes/index.html</a>). It has a limited English translation. </p> <p><strong> I'm off for a weekend to Budapest shortly. What's the safest cheap way of getting from the airport into the city centre, and what are the 'must see' sights for a short visit?</strong><br> A. Spencer, by email </p> <p> A minibus from the airport will take you straight to your hotel for around \u00a310 return. A taxi is more expensive. A bus is far cheaper but much slower. </p> <p>Start exploring the city with a stroll up to Fisherman's Bastion, where there are wonderful views, day or night. </p> <p>If you're there in the daytime, look around the Castle Hill area, home to the Royal Palace and the medieval Old Town. </p> <p>Then you can branch away from the most touristed area to the parliament building, which has a wonderful Gothic interior. Margaret Island is a lovely place for a stroll, rollerblade or picnic. </p> <p>You must take a soak in one of the baths that are a Budapest institution. Gellert and Szechenyi are the best known, but such local favourites as Lukacs and Kiraly are also worth a visit. </p> <p>Budapest is full of modern cafes and restaurants. The VI List Ferenc Ter in Pest is a great place to rest your legs while listening to classical music.

  "Michael Howard will use the Conservative's final party conference before next year's likely general election to spell out a \"timetable for action\" of hour-by-hour, day-by-day achievements for the first days of a new Tory government. <p>Brushing aside doubts about the party's electability in the wake of its fourth place in last week's Hartlepool byelection, the Tory leader will set out a traditional tax-cutting agenda - although leave details on where cuts will fall to the actual election manifesto.</p> <p>Launching the party's five days at Bournemouth, the Tory chairman, Liam Fox, said: \"We intend to cut taxes - and how far will depend on the finances when we find them.\"</p> <p>Briefing journalists on the eve of Monday's official opening of the conference, Dr Fox said the themes would be \"freedom and security\".</p> <p>Shadow ministers will all work to a timetable setting out concrete legislation within days of coming to power in a bid to reengage with a \"disaffected and cynical\" electorate.</p> <p>Dr Fox said: \"People have fallen out of love with Tony Blair - but they haven't fallen in love with the Tories.</p> <p>\"This is the most intrusive government we have ever had, from means testing to a speed camera on every corner.</p> <p>\"We stand for low taxation, deregulation and secure borders.\"</p> <p>Revealing the party would try to wrestle back asylum and immigration from the \"extremists\", Dr Fox said: \"We will not be inhibited from talking about these issues. We will not abandon them to the extremists who would love to have this field to themselves.\"</p> <p><b>Labour 'in chaos'</b><br></p> <p>Earlier, speaking to the BBC, Mr Howard claimed the Labour government was now \"in chaos\" following Mr Blair's declaration of an intention to retire.</p> <p>Denying that the Tories now needed \"a miracle\" to win the next election, Mr Howard instead went on the offensive, challenging the prime minister to a series of US-style TV debates before the next year's likely contest.</p> <p>The conference is taking place in the wake of an opinion poll today which showed that two-thirds of top party officials could envisage pulling out of Europe - closer to the position of single-issue rivals Ukip than the official Tory policy of \"not foreseeing\" such an outcome.</p> <p>Mr Howard, speaking this morning on the BBC, insisted that the party was in \"quite good shape\".</p> <p>In an interview with BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme, he dismissed suggestions that the best the party could hope for at the general election was to finish second ahead of the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>\"Of course that is not true,\" he said. </p> <p>He said that the political landscape had changed \"hugely\" as a result of Mr Blair's shock announcement last week that he intended to stand down after serving one more term as prime minister. </p> <p>\"The choice that people will have at the next general election is between another Labour government, now thrown totally into chaos as a consequence of Tony Blair's announcement, or a Conservative government,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair has fired the starting pistol for the race for his succession and everybody is going to be jostling for position, everybody is going to be vying for the succession. </p> <p>\"The truth is that everybody is going to be looking for their own advantage and the country's going to come a poor second.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard rejected suggestions that he would now be taking the party to the right on issues like Europe and immigration and asylum in a bid to stave off the threat from Ukip. </p> <p>\"I don't accept that this is a basis for looking at these things. I don't really accept this distinction between right and left and centre,\" he said. </p> <p>As party officials put last-minute touches to the Bournemouth Conference Centre, which is festooned with placards of the new Tory logo, Mr Howard went on a lunchtime walkabout in steady drizzle with local police to discuss law and order.</p> <p>Tomorrow's keynote speech comes from the shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, who is expected to make pledges - but not commitments - on where the Tories would cut indirect taxation and raise income tax thresholds.</p> <p><b>EU survey</b><br></p> <p>Meanwhile, a survey today revealed that more than two out of three Conservative party constituency chairmen envisage a situation where Britain could pull out of the EU. </p> <p>Of the 110 chairmen who responded to the BBC survey, 71 disagreed with the proposition that there were no circumstances under which Britain should withdraw from the EU. Only 25 said that they agreed, while 14 said that they did not know or refused to answer. </p> <p>Meanwhile, 38 said that the party's general election manifesto should include a firm commitment to cut the standard rate of income tax, as against 51 who disagreed and 21 who did not know or refused to answer. </p> <p>Almost half - 53 - said they opposed legislation to give gay and lesbian couples the same legal rights as married couples, as against 35 who supported it and 22 who did not know or refused to answer.</p>",
  "The woman charged with stamping out racism in Britain's biggest police force has quit after claiming she too was a victim of racial discrimination. <p>Julia Smith, 48, who headed the race and diversity unit at the Metropolitan Police Authority for four years, has won a six-figure settlement as she prepared to take the MPA to an employment tribunal. </p> <p>The MPA, which oversees London's police force, faces two further charges of racism from black employees. The disclosures are a bitter setback to the capital's police force which has been beset by accusations of racism. </p> <p>The authority tried to gag Smith from talking to the media after the settlement, but last week she told The Observer how she felt 'completely disillusioned' by her experience. </p> <p>Smith joined the Authority two years after the Macpherson report into the Stephen Lawrence murder that branded the police 'institutionally racist'. But she believes all moves to tackle the problem of racism in the Met were done without any 'heartfelt conviction' and were 'tokenistic'. </p> <p>Smith said: 'They do the absolute minimum... If the authority cannot get its own house in order when it comes to race issues, how on earth can it hope to change the way the police force tackles racism?' </p> <p>Smith's own case against the MPA involves her application for two executive jobs that she did not get. First she applied to become deputy chief of the authority. Then her job was split into two and a white male in her team was promoted over her despite only having worked in England for a year. </p> <p>Smith, who has advised the Home Office and the Greater London Authority, believes that she was discriminated against because she did try to put race issues up the agenda. Smith was one of the prime movers behind the authority's decision to scrutinise the police's stop and search policy. This has long been one of the most contentious areas of policing and drew accusation of racism because black and Asian men get stopped more frequently. </p> <p>The report published by the authority in May claims the practice is 'influenced by racial bias'. It said black people were four times more likely to be stopped than white people and urged work with communities for a more 'intelligence-led approach'. According to the report, the stop-and-search rates of black people in London increased by 30 per cent between 2001 and 2002. For Asian people it rose by 41 per cent but for white people by only 8 per cent. </p> <p>Smith was also involved in trying to increase police recruiting from minorities. 'We were trying to set a new tone, to engender trust and confidence in the police from communities. It wasn't just about black community but all groups: women, Asians, refugees. I ended up very disillusioned.' </p> <p>Another case being taken to the employment tribunal involves the authority's head of security who alleges he faces open discrimination because he is black. Despite being head of security for three years his access is restricted on the second floor of the four-storey headquarters next to Scotland Yard in central London. </p> <p>The third racial discrimination case taken against the MPA involves a junior member of staff who had worked for the authority for several years. He learnt a manager had contacted the Home Office to inquire about his immigration status without telling him.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Jackson Hole, Wyoming, USA</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> Felice Hardy, co-editor of The Good Skiing &amp; Snowboarding Guide. </p> <p> <strong> Why? </strong> I've been at least six times. My most memorable experience of it is being a guest at a friend's wedding at the top of the Bridger Gondola. The dress code was 'ski casual', and the bridegroom had a 'best dog' called Max, which carried the rings in a barrel around its neck. We toasted the happy couple with snow-chilled champagne, then skied down the Gondola Summit trail behind them before the reception in a nearby hotel. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant: </strong> For lunch, upstairs in the Alpenhof (00 1 307 733 3242) at the edge of the piste for delicious salads. For dinner, Masa Sushi (00 1 307 733 2962) in the Inn at Jackson Hole, on West McCollister Drive, in Teton Village. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar:</strong> The Million Dollar Cowboy Bar on Jackson Town Square. You sit on bar stools made from Western saddles, watched over by an unnervingly poised, stuffed grizzly bear. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> The Stagecoach in the nearby village of Wilson, where you can dance the Western Swing to live music. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay:</strong> The Amangani (www. amangani.com) has rooms from around \u00a3360 a night per person. There's a beautiful slate outdoor swimming pool. More affordable is The Wort (<a href=\"http://www.worthotel.com\">worthotel.com</a>, rooms from \u00a380 a night) in the centre of town, an old stagecoach inn with Wild West atmosphere. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> the Rendezvous Trail, from the top of the tram, starts off-piste then levels out onto a fast, steep path to Teton Village. </p> <p><strong> Kitzb\u00fchel Austria</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by:</strong> Nick Fellows, presenter of Skiing on 4. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> It never disappoints. Kitzb\u00fchel World Cup weekend is like the FA Cup Final for skiers, with Austrian hospitality at its finest and a ski race where the world's best downhill skiers rate victory more highly than than an Olympic gold medal. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> The Stanglwirt hotel (00 43 5358 2000; <a href=\"http://www.stanglwirt.com\">stanglwirt.com</a>) on the main road into town offers amazing food. Its Cowstall restaurant has views into the cow barn next door, and there is a shark aquarium in the spa. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar/apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> Drink in the British pub The Londoner in the centre of town, eat and celeb-spot in Italian restaurant Chizzo (00 43 5356 64369), on Josef Herold Str. I've seen Bernie Ecclestone, Steffi Graf, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to name just a few. The after-race parties often go on for 24 hours. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay: </strong> If your budget allows, go to the five-star Zur Tenne (0043 5356 644440; <a href=\"http://www.hotelzurtenne.com\">hotelzurtenne.com</a> double rooms from \u00a394) on Vorderstadt, with country house style and a spa. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run: </strong> The hardest and most feared downhill course, the Strife. </p> <p><strong> La Grave France</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> Caroline Stuart taylor, chief executive of the Ski Club of Great Britain. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> It's a small, friendly village with a very big mountain. I've been there 10 or more times, mostly with friends. I went before it even had a loo on the mountain. It's developed a bit, but it remains off the beaten track. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> sit outside Chancel, a mountain hut restaurant overlooking a lake on the Chancel Return and watch people ski two couloirs, Bande and Pidou. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar/apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> Village bars come and go. A few have live bands playing, which bring out everyone in the place. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay:</strong> The Hotel Edelweiss (00 33 4 7679 9093; <a href=\"http://www.hotel-edelweiss.com\">hotel-edelweiss.com</a>, rooms from \u00a333 a night) is friendly and central with good food. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> the resort has only one mountain, one run and one lift. It's all off piste skiing, with two huge bowls and amazing powder. </p> <p><strong> Aviemore Scotland</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> Jeremy Sladen, general manager of the Snowboard Asylum chain of stores. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> I know the snow record's poor, I know it's expensive, but there's something about riding there that reminds me why I started snowboarding. Snowboarding at home is a real soul experience, but odds are the weather will be rubbish. In terms of sheer vertical descent it's not a patch on the Alps or North America, but everyone in Aviemore's a damn sight more grateful for your custom. I spent my formative snowboard years living there, and continuous bad day after bad day makes a good day really special. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> The Skiing Doo (01479 810392), Grampian Rd, has proper hospitality, simple food and superb beer. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar/apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> as above. After a good day's riding you can go to a proper pub and drink proper beer. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> skiing over the back of the mountain on a powder day with good friends is mindblowing. </p> <p><strong> Chamonix France</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> Cate langmuir, editor of the Good Ski Guide. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> It is an established town in the shadow of Europe's highest peak, Mont Blanc, and steeped in mountaineering history. I've skied there so many times I've lost count, from cruising with kids to ski-touring journeys with friends, with my 70-something father and with my keen-as-mustard nieces. </p> <p>My favourite trip was in March 2003, when my sister and two brothers skied there together for the first time in 20 years, and the four of us slept in one room in a cheap hostel in town. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> Munchies, on the Rue de Moulin, has unusual Euro-Asian fusion cuisine. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar:</strong> the Chambre Neuf in the Gustavia hotel in the Avenue Michel Croz is quirky, with lots of little rooms. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> Chamonix is not the place for moonlit sleigh rides but you can try most active apr\u00e8s-ski pursuits, and the Alpine Museum, also in Avenue Michel Croz, is interesting. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay:</strong> The nicest place I've stayed is Ski Weekend's luxurious Chalet les Jumelles (01392 878353; <a href=\"http://www.skiweekend.com\">skiweekend.com</a>) It sleeps six for seven nights from \u00a39,394. My room had the most beautifully crafted wooden sink. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> Ski the Vall\u00e9e Blanche with a guide for big mountain excitement. You ride up to a staggering 3,840m in the cable car, then ski 24 kilometres down the glacier, with an essential stop at the Refuge for lunch. </p> <p><strong> St Anton/Lech Austria</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> Bob Brigham, managing director of Ellis Brigham Mountain Sports store chain. </p> <p> <strong> Why? </strong> It has a perfect mix of modern, fast lifts, amazing skiing and wonderful Alpine charm. When the slopes close, St Anton goes up a gear, and has the best apr\u00e8s-ski in the Alps. I've been many times, starting with visits with my brother Ellis and friends in the swinging Sixties, which had a long lasting impact on future sporting and business plans. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> the Arlberg-Hospiz-Alm (00 43 5446 3625), above the village of St Christoph, has an incredible menu and wine list, beautiful surroundings and the best service. Set aside a full afternoon and evening and really go for it, a true ski-in, taxi-home dining experience. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar:</strong> For its full-on atmosphere, the world head quarters of apr\u00e8s-ski, The Mooserwirt (00 43 5446 3588) is hard to beat. This colossal cathedral of beer consumption is just above the home run into St Anton and kicks-off at 3pm. There's dancing around and on long tables in an igloo tent outside. Leave your skis away from the masses to make sure you can find them later. And remember that you still have about half a mile to ski home in the dark. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> the Rodelalm is a tiny hut tucked away in the woods. Gl\u00fchwein and oompah music don't get better than this. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay: </strong> for full, over the top traditional Austrian charm, go to the Hotel Alte Post (00 43 5446 25530; <a href=\"http://book.best western.com\">book.best western.com</a>, rooms from \u00a390 a night) near the lifts. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> the one off the top of the Valluga mountain is mind-blowing; a few hundred metres of hanging-on for dear life, followed by miles of open, near-deserted terrain. </p> <p><strong> M\u00e9ribel France</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> Annabel Forrest, buying director for Blacks ski stores. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> Great for extensive skiing and easy access for weekend trips. I always ski with a crowd of friends. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> the Bel-Air (00 33 4 7908 0093), at the top of the Courchevel 1650 gondola, has a great terrace, fabulous views and delicious plats du jours. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar/apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> Le Rond Point, on the main piste through the town, but my apr\u00e8s-ski activities are a lot more reserved than they used to be. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay: </strong> La Chaudanne (00 33 4 7908 6176; <a href=\"http://www.lachaudanne.com\">lachaudanne.com</a>). Rooms cost from around \u00a3800 per person for seven nights. It's cosy, charming and affordable, with easy access to lifts. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> down to M\u00e9ribel from the top. </p> <p><strong> Mammoth Mountain California, USA</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> DON ORR, vice-president of information at <a href=\"http://www.snowboarding.com\">snowboarding.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Why?</strong> It's a big mountain with an amazing terrain park, a very long season and lots of sunshine. The snow is more similar to that of the Sierra Mountains which are a six-hour drive away, and has a lighter feel than the local snow of the southern California mountains. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> the Shogun in the Sierra Centre Mall, a great Japanese restaurant with a sushi bar. The chefs always invent a new speciality, such as hot drawn butter, to seriously melt in your mouth. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar:</strong> Yodler, at the base of Main Lodge has a laid-back atmosphere and is usually packed. The new club Fever is the place to see and be seen. It's in The Village, a complex where all the restaurants, shops and bars are. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> hit the Jacuzzi at the house or take a trip to the natural hot springs 10 miles out of town. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay:</strong> I rent a private home or stay at the Village in Mammoth, where you can roll out of bed, grab a coffee and walk to the gondola, so there's no need to dig out your car or put on chains. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> The Park, Unbound Main, Steeps and Paranoid Flats are my favourite runs. </p> <p><strong> Gourette France</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chosen by: </strong> Arnaud Palu, operations director of Xscape, indoor ski slopes in Castleford and Milton Keynes. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> This fantastic and beautiful resort in my native Pyrenees is versatile, combining the joys of extreme and relaxing skiing. I've been there almost every year since I was a child. I once spent a magical Christmas with family and friends, when I even convinced my Dad to try skiing and converted my Alps-fan girlfriend into a Pyrenees fan. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite restaurant:</strong> Chalet L'Amoulat (00 33 5 5905 1206, on l'Espagne \u00e0 Lourde), the chef's speciality is a fabulous dish, escalope de foie gras frais aux pommes sur son pain perdu aux \u00e9pices . </p> <p> <strong> Favourite bar:</strong> Le Winfield, an Australian bar on a boulevard overlooking the Pyrenees. You can see gorgeous sunsets from there. Remember that Australia is a very exotic place for French people. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite apr\u00e8s-ski:</strong> an amazing spa a few miles away in the thermal city of Les Eaux Bonnes. It's called La Station Thermale de Eaux Bonnes (<a href=\"http://www.eurothermes.com\">eurothermes.com</a>). Jacuzzis, saunas, massages and thermal water get you in the right shape and frame of mind to start a new skiing day. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place to stay:</strong> I'm lucky enough to have my family nearby in Pau. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite run:</strong> The area called Cotch, at 2,429m, is a beautiful spot overlooking the national park and faces south so is a great spot to work on your tan.</p>",
  "<p>It would have been interesting to test drive an Evolution VIII 260 which didn't come with a personalised number plate. The car I found myself at the wheel of was 3CCC. Was that for Cool Cat's Car, or maybe Coppers Can't Catch? No, Mitsubishi told me, it stood for Colt Car Company, and they also own 1CCC, 2CCC and 4CCC. All week I caught people giving me curious backward glances, trying to work out why such an ordinary-looking bloke (he doesn't look famous, and he certainly doesn't look rich) should be driving a car with plates that must be worth, oh, thousands. </p> <p>But it wasn't me they should have been looking at, it was the car. You see, if any vehicle deserves a second look, this is definitely it. From the outside it is so unassumingly modest, so uninspiringly ordinary, that you would guess it was nothing more than a shiny new fleet car, a slightly tweaked boy racer's pride and joy. On the inside, however, it's a race-tuned, rally-honed speed freak which is so exhilarating to drive it should come with a health warning advising pregnant women and overweight men with heart murmurs to take the bus. </p> <p>If it were to audition for Stars in Their Eyes, it would be the quietly spoken postman from Manchester who returns through the dry ice as a fully pumped up Meat Loaf. One touch of the accelerator unleashes such force from beneath the bonnet you expect to hear a deafening 'kaaaboom' as you smash the sound barrier between sets of red lights. I'm not joking. This rather sober saloon boasts wheel-smoking, Ferrari-type acceleration, yet it only costs \u00a323,999. In many ways it would make the perfect getaway car - four doors, sensible boot, innocuous looking on the street... and a top speed of 152mph. </p> <p>The car owes its pedigree to Mitsubishi's ambition to dominate rallying and, since the car's launch in 1993, the 'Evo' has won four World Rally Championships. The street car hasn't left behind its muddy past. Red Brembo calliper brakes glint through the 17in Enkei wheels; the steering wheel and gear stick are stitched leather, and the seats are top of the range Recaro buckets. All very impressive, but the car is no oil painting (despite the fact that Mitsubishi gives each a limited-edition number - this one was No 0003). It's brawn without beauty. Think John Prescott. The money has all been spent on raw power. For you number crunchers, the engine is a 2-litre, 4-cylinder, 16 Valve DOHC twin-scroll turbocharged and intercooled ECI-Multi 4G63 engine ... (I had to copy that out from the manual). In layman's terms that translates as 'probably the most phenomenally quick car you'll ever drive'.</p> <p>The Evo is aimed at 'married men in their forties', which, again, roughly translates as 'good purchase for family men having a mid-life crisis'. The unflashy exterior means it's also ideal for the gasping mid-lifer who doesn't really want anyone to know he's having a crisis.</p> <p>So, having saved a fortune on not splashing out on that Ferrari, you can now buy an Evo and spend the difference on personalised plates.</p> <p><strong>Braking news </strong></p> <p>Film-loving motor nuts recently nominated their favourite car stars. The winner, with a third of the votes, was James Bond's Lotus Esprit in the Spy Who Loved Me. And in last place? Del and Rodney's Reliant Robin.</p>",
  "<p>On the day her life changed, when she was 13 years old, Majlinda was on the way to help her aunt with the ironing of clothes in preparation for her cousin's wedding in their village in northern Albania. She was a little short of reaching the house when three strange men stopped her. They grabbed her, bundled her into a car, blindfolded, bound and gagged her; she was then driven to the southern town of Gjirokastra. Not until the men and Majlinda had crossed the border with Greece and reached Corinth was she told: 'Now you are going to work.'</p> <p>'At first I did not know what they were talking about,' recalls Majlinda, 'until they took me to a flat where there were other women and told me: \"You work here now.\" When I refused, they said they knew my family, and if I made trouble they would kill them. I thought of the possibilities. I was afraid to stay, I was afraid to leave, so I started to work - they forced me to, with violence.'</p> <p>Beaten and raped into submission by her traffickers, Majlinda began work, confined to a flat, from 8pm until 5am, obliged to meet a monetary quota entailing some 20 clients a night. 'And even if I made enough money,' she says, 'they usually found a reason to beat me when the clients had finished for the night.'</p> <p>Majlinda is scarred around the eyes and forehead. She talks at a shelter, back in Albania, to which she has escaped and at which she is hiding from her traffickers, trying to recover. Her expression is subdued, dead-pan. Outside the sun shines, but the room is leaden with her grief, and her story.</p> <p>She was in Greece for a year, until 'the police started catching up with them. So we came back to Albania and took a speedboat to Italy.' Majlinda was sold on to Florence for a price she doesn't know. By now, 'there were two new Albanians in the group running me, also one remained from Greece.' She was forced to work the streets on the scrappy edges of the city, well hidden from the beauty of its renaissance centre. After dealing with her clients, Majlinda handed over the proceeds, upon which 'all three would violate me at the end of my work. They would get high on drugs - marijuana and cocaine - and come at me. And every night they beat me - even if I made the \u20ac 1,000 [\u00a3685] they insisted on, they always found an excuse.'</p> <p>Majlinda's captors were part of a syndicate - it was clear to her that 'they exploited many other women as well as me, and had a number of houses, but would not let us meet.' There were 'good clients and bad clients,' she says. Good clients? 'I mean the ones who just wanted to have sex; the bad ones were the ones who beat me, or beat me and stole my money, so I had to work harder to earn it again.' The traffickers, she says, would 'compete against one another with the money they made out of me and the other women. They would compete for who could buy the flashiest car, or the best clothes.'</p> <p>After a year in Florence, Majlinda was moved by car to Amsterdam. In the bustle, she says, 'I was surrounded by people, but completely alone. I could speak to no one. I lost all hope. I thought there was no way out. I was afraid that if I talked to anyone, the traffickers would do something to my family.'</p> <p>Finally, a 'good client' from Afghanistan 'told me not to be afraid, and encouraged me to escape with him. I did, I trusted him, and became pregnant by him.' For a moment it seems that Majlinda's story will achieve some perverse redemption. 'But I was wrong,' she says, her hands kneading one another as she speaks. 'He wanted me to work for him instead, and he also beat me all the time. I gave birth to my child, and when that happened, I decided... </p> <p>'I told my story to a woman who used to come and see my husband [which is how Majlinda describes the Afghan] and she in turn told me about some Catholic nuns at Utrecht who rescued prostitutes. And I went to them. They helped me register my child and get a ticket back to Albania.' But still Majlinda stares down at the table, and at her hands, as she speaks. </p> <p>'I finally contacted my family and asked them to keep my son, but they didn't even want to see me, they were ashamed of me. My father said: \"So far as we're concerned, you are dead.\" Thus rejected, Majlinda and her baby took refuge at a shelter in Albania's capital, Tirana, but she was obliged to leave her child at a place she will not discuss, and move on alone, after the Afghan came looking for his quarry and his son. 'This place is my last chance,' she says of the second shelter to which she came. 'But I am terrified he will come. And that I will see the Albanian men before my eyes once more.'</p> <p>Majlinda's enslavement lasted four years. 'Men?' she ponders, 'I don't know what to say. All I know now is that I don't ever want to see another man in my life. All I want now is to be with my child, and to work. There were moments,' says Majlinda, now 17, 'when I thought I should not be alive, that I should be dead. But then I thought: why not? You have to be brave to survive. I have to be strong, otherwise I cannot get out of this.' And with that she smiles - the faint, hollow smile of the survivor. </p> <p>Majlinda is but one - bold and fortunate enough to have escaped - among hundreds of thousands enslaved and entrapped by a depraved and burgeoning crime, one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing: trafficking in young women and children for enforced prostitution. In terms of the income it nets, trafficking is believed to lie in third place behind drugs and arms. There is evidence that criminal syndicates are switching from drugs to women and girls, finding them easier to transport than an assignment of cocaine or heroin. Moreover, a woman can be sold and resold over and over, while drugs can only be sold once. </p> <p>The scale of the crime is impossible to quantify. The US State Department this year said it believed between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked across borders each year; profits are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. And of those hundreds of thousands, an inestimable but high proportion are, under international law, children - under 18 years of age, and therefore entitled to special protection under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Documents produced by Unicef and Save the Children have found up to 80 per cent of those trafficked from some corners of Albania and Moldova to be children, with reports showing 'a decline in the average age of children/women being trafficked for prostitution'. </p> <p>Trafficking is, crucially, distinct from people-smuggling or migration, with which it is often, erroneously - and disastrously - confused by policy makers. The pitiful business of smuggling occurs when a syndicate is paid to take a group of people across borders illegally but willingly, in search of work or asylum. And although some people may elect to be taken by their traffickers, a trafficked person does not sign up for the purposes to which they are put. Trafficking was defined by a UN convention in 2000 as meaning to recruit and transport people 'by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion', such as abduction, fraud or deception, or, indeed, 'abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability'. </p> <p>'We would all like specific numbers,' says Steve Ashby, programme director for Save the Children in Albania. 'But they are simply not available. What we can safely assume is that the numbers are high enough to warrant very serious concern. It is impossible to over-stress the level of oppression and brutality - the vicious abuse of human rights being inflicted by these traffickers. And the situation is going to get worse before it gets better. </p> <p>'The trafficker,' says Ashby, 'is invariably ahead of the authorities. They are always finding alternative means to carry on. The phenomenon is shifting all the time. The trafficking problem outstrips all the efforts being made to control it.'</p> <p>'This has become,' says Giovanna Barberis, Unicef's representative in Moldova - the main source of trafficking for sexual exploitation in Europe - 'a matter for dramatic concern'.</p> <p>So far as Europe is concerned, the countries in which communism collapsed tend to provide both traffickers and trafficked. Moldova, Albania, Ukraine and Romania are the main source countries from which women are abducted. They are countries where social structures have imploded, where large sections of the economy are controlled by criminal syndicates and where communist regimes have been replaced by corruption as a means of political power. Trafficking has become integral to the economies of these countries - it is the source for fortunes, for cash to buy champagne and luxury cars, for profits laundered into resorts and hotels. The misery of women and children like Majlinda is a foundation stone for many a new concrete tower in Tirana or Chisinau. 'All along the line,' says Ashby, 'there is a chain of people involved in this trade, if you can call it that. The traffickers themselves, transporters, forgers of documents, safe houses, speedboats that take them from Albania to Italy - a great network of commercial interests engaged in the business.'</p> <p>There are so-called 'destination' countries in Eastern Europe, too, but the vast, hidden and terrifying 'markets' are wider and elsewhere - across Western Europe and, ever more, into Russia, Turkey, Israel, the Middle East and the Gulf states. The victims, invariably, are drafted from the vulnerable and subjugated quarters of East European society - from desperately poor villages, from rugged mountains, from shanty slums. This is the new criminal power play in the new Europe. </p> <p>Albania is a land of dire poverty, fierce patriotism, rugged mountains in the north, olive groves and vines to the south - for decades cut off from the rest of Europe and now opened up to a Western dream world with which it is bombarded on television, to which its youth aspires. It is a country whence tens of thousands of girls are trafficked and through which women are brought from other parts of Eastern Europe to Greece or Italy, and thence across Europe. The same syndicates are opening up new channels, after a clampdown on the Adriatic sea route, through Serbia and the former Yugoslav countries into the West. </p> <p>'It is estimated,' says a report commissioned by Unicef, 'that over the past 10 years, 100,000 Albanian women and girls have been trafficked to Western Europe and other Balkan countries. Albania is also one of the main transit countries for the trafficking of women and girls from central and Eastern Europe.' In Albania, fear of abduction by traffickers is so great that the numbers of teenaged girls attending high school in rural areas has fallen dramatically. In remote areas, 'as many as 90 per cent of girls no longer receive a high-school education,' says a report by Save the Children. 'Even here in Tirana, they are afraid,' warns Svetlana Roko, who runs a day centre for trafficked children and children at risk in the capital. 'The Albanian pimp,' says the report, 'has a reputation for extreme ruthlessness, and murder is not uncommon.' In one case in which a woman agreed to testify to the police in Italy, her father returned home to find the mutilated remains of his other daughter splattered around the house. </p> <p>Some women are simply kidnapped, others are lured by promises of work. 'It depends,' says Vera Lesko, who runs a shelter for trafficked women in Vlora, in the Albanian south. 'They could be promised a modelling career, work in shops, serving in bars and, more recently, they have been enticed by promises of academic scholarships. However, when they come to me they are totally destroyed, physically and psychologically. What we try to do is give them back their lives, tell them that their suffering is past, that they should focus on their own value, on what they have. We try to re-integrate them, to teach them vocational skills. We send them to schools in Vlora, with other women who do not know their background.'</p> <p>But in spite of all this, says Lesko, 'The majority are simply re-trafficked when they return. They have nothing; they are annihilated. I had a woman who had been trafficked and re-trafficked for 10 years. She did not know how to live in a different way. Something inside her had changed forever.'</p> <p>Traffickers, says Lesko, hang around police stations waiting to pick up their prey as soon as they are released. In many cases, there is collusion between police and traffickers. However - in defence of her work and in praise of those who come to her - 'a not insignificant number make it. They re-integrate, they remake themselves, and that is when all this work seems worthwhile.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/magazine/story/0,11913,1318358,00.html\">Read part 2</a></p>",
  "<p>Katalina swaddles the baby she says gives meaning to her life, once shattered. She is staying with a family - which knows nothing of her past - in a rain-swept village in the north of Moldova, but will soon have a place of her own, she hopes. </p> <p>At the beginning of this year, Katalina - who had grown up in an orphanage - was abandoned by her boyfriend after telling him she was pregnant. Soon afterwards, she was invited by a Russian woman to a birthday party in a local bar in her village near Moldova's second city, Balti. There, Katalina was offered a future in Moscow, with an option to work as a house painter or line worker at a pasta factory. Katalina opted to give it a try - why not? There was nothing for her in Moldova. But events twisted strangely when she and her Russian minder reached the Ukrainian border.</p> <p>'A policeman met us and drove us across the frontier, avoiding the crossings. The Russian paid the policeman and we went to get false papers made.' They then proceeded by train to Moscow, where Katalina met another girl from near Balti, who told her what was expected. 'You can't get away from here,' said the girl. 'They will break your legs.'</p> <p>So began Katalina's life as an enslaved prostitute, working a beat beneath a railway bridge, for which her traffickers paid local police. 'I was told never to say that I was pregnant, else the clients would not want me, and I would be beaten to pieces,' recalls Katalina. Some clients, she says, 'kept me for a number of days, and invited their friends. One man kept me for three or four days in a basement and invited 20 men. When I objected they told me I was a bitch. They had bought me and could do whatever they liked to me. Another time, I was on the 11th floor of a building with seven Moldovans, all of them taking drugs. After they had had their way, they insisted I smoke some drugs, too. When I refused, they became violent, and one of them opened a window and threatened to throw me out. But there was one man less stoned than the rest, who said, \"You are just a dirty whore,\" and sent me from the room.'</p> <p>Time passed in this way, until Katalina's pregnancy could no longer be hidden. Clients, their sensibilities offended, would beat and insult her, demanding their money back. The Russian traffickers beat her, too, saying they would lock Katalina away until she was due, 'and that they would sell my baby, when it came'.</p> <p>Katalina has an expression full of guile; it comes as no surprise when she says that she elected to escape. The flat in which she was kept by day was watched by police officers on the pimp's behalf, to prevent the girls from leaving. But Katalina noted when the police watch went for its daily lunch break. That was when she, and the other girl from her area, made a run for it. </p> <p>Laughter comes hard while talking about these things, but now the artful Katalina has her company in unlikely stitches. 'We did a funny thing,' she says. 'After running away from the flat, we took a trolleybus to Red Square, thinking this is where the train to Chisinau would go from. Just imagine, two escaped Moldovan prostitutes lost in a tourist trap, asking smart people how to get the train back to their little village.' Having found the station, they were picked up by the railway police and sent home. </p> <p>Moldova is Europe's poorest country and, says Unicef's representative there, Giovanna Barberis, 'one of the main, if not the main source country for the trafficking of women and children'.</p> <p>This is how a briefing paper drawn up by the Swedish Foreign Ministry's aid wing Sida - which is active in counter-trafficking projects in Eastern Europe - describes the country: 'Moldova has probably suffered the most devastating peacetime decline in economic performance and living standards of any country in modern times. From a situation of relative prosperity, GDP in this country has fallen by more than 70 per cent within a decade - placing Moldova on a par with the poorest countries in Asia and Africa. For most Moldovans, life has become a daily struggle to satisfy the most basic needs against increasingly uneven odds.'</p> <p>The bus station in Chisinau, Moldova's care-worn capital, is a monument to the nation's reaction to its fate - mass emigration. The population is officially set at 4.5m, after a census in 1989, but, says Barberis, 'the reality is probably nearer 3.5m. Hundreds of thousands have simply left, to find work, legally or illegally, in the West.' Every week, fleets of heaving coaches leave this bus station - with its mosaic showing a happy socialist life in factory and field - bound for Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. As a result, thousands of children are left abandoned by their parents, becoming prey to the trafficker's eye.</p> <p>Under communism, Moldova, with its fertile black soil, was the orchard of the USSR, and its industry was locked into the trans-Soviet infrastructure. Now, Moldovan society has been ravaged by a corrupt neo-communist political class and an economy beholden to the profits of crime. The price of agricultural produce is so low that much of it withers - literally - on the vine. The average wage is $50 (\u00a328) per month. And the generation now growing up with no memory of communism or relative prosperity is prey to those engaged in Moldova's rapidly growing and infamous export - human beings. </p> <p>'There are about 1m Moldovans living abroad,' says Barberis, 'and among that 1m, a great many have left illegally and are exposed to trafficking. They go in different ways. The traffickers are getting more and more sophisticated. There can be direct contact with a relative, friend, or friend of a friend. There are advertisements in the newspapers for fake jobs as waitresses, babysitters or cooks. They are invariably jobs advertised for women and it becomes an attractive offer, given the fact that unemployment is extremely high, given the fact that access to health care and education is extremely low, given the fact that domestic violence is deeply rooted.'</p> <p>There is a correlation between the subjugation of women and children in Moldovan society and their vulnerability to trafficking, says Daniela Popescu, who runs the Amicul centre for 'at risk' children in Chisinau. Some 80 per cent of trafficking victims, she says, have also been victims of domestic violence. 'There are old sayings passed on from grandparents,' she says: 'they say an unbeaten woman is like an untidy house, or beating his woman is a man's divine right.' Women are held in low esteem, have low self-esteem and tend to accept things as they are, not to denounce their men. They are accustomed to hard physical work, so it is often the best and strongest of them who decide they can be free from emotional and physical abuse, and can handle hard work abroad.</p> <p>'The traffickers are very much aware of these subjugated conditions,' she continues, 'and, ironically, will make promises such as, \"You are working at home and being beaten - why not work away from the beating, and get good money?\"'</p> <p>The village of Biesti, an hour north of the capital, is typical - the effect is unmistakable and striking. This is a community where there are no adults; a place where only children and old people walk the main street and muddy tracks. The children have for the most part been abandoned by their parents, and are thus vulnerable to the traffickers. Angelina, aged 13, just about manages on what her mother and father send back - she explains that her parents left for Orvieto in Italy, leaving her to look after her 10-year-old brother. </p> <p>But unlike most villages of its kind, there is a quiet revolution under way in Biesti - proving that where there is initiative, the traffickers will not have it all their own way. That with the right resources and the will to battle the traffickers with knowledge, there is reason for faint hope in this woebegone landscape. For here is one of a network of day centres funded by Unicef, devoted almost entirely to raising awareness of trafficking and 'life skills' in a world without adults, or where adults do not care. Every child in Biesti has, as a result, seen a film called Lilja 4-ever by the director Lukas Moodysson, about a Russian girl trafficked to Stockholm. 'We all cried when we saw it,' says Veronica, aged 16. 'We talked about it, and wondered, what would we do?' </p> <p>Veronica and her friend Aksenia are prime targets for any trafficker, but both girls talk with disarming maturity about the dangers, the film and its message. 'It is not enough just to have the information to be on the lookout,' says Aksenia, 'it is a matter of having the skills to act when and if you find that you are in trouble.' Everyone, however, wants to leave the village, adds Veronica. </p> <p>There are 63 'residential schools' for what are called the 'social orphans' of Moldova, where discarded children learn and live. These are places like that in which Katalina was raised, and in all, they hold some 13,000 children, any one of whom could be said to be 'at risk' to trafficking. In these places, too, Unicef is working against the peril that awaits these children once they try - as they will - to leave. At the orphanage in Orhei, a group of 14-year-olds has also seen Lilja 4-ever and rehearse a play they will perform to the school and around town about social exclusion, with its obvious message about the return of trafficked victims. 'We are learning that we must have them back,' says Svetlana, 'even if they have HIV and Aids.' </p> <p>'It is amazing to me,' says Barberis, 'that this issue of trafficking is simply not a matter for the government in this country. Similarly, not only is there no support for the victims of trafficking when they return, but there is no effort to re-integrate them, to rescue them from their non-future.'</p> <p>Viorica, a child of 17 from southern Moldova, cannot finish her story. She wanted, she says, to go to music school and improve her singing voice, 'to learn to sing and play'. But life had other plans for her. Instead, she was lured from her village by a distant cousin, to Turkey, with a promise of work. When she arrived at the coastal resort of Antalya, she 'was told to put on some clothes and get ready. \"It's time for you to work,\" they said. I asked what work? They said I was going to a hotel to be with men. When I objected,' she continues, 'they said I would have to do this thing if I ever wanted to see Moldova again. They threatened me with a gun and made me get into a car. We got to the hotel. The thing is, I'd never been with a man before. I was a virgin, and that night, they made me go with 11 men.' At this point, Viorica stops in the tracks of her tears and her words. It is a terrible moment. </p> <p>The psychologist treating Viorica, Ana Chirsanov, tells me that the girl has tried to commit suicide. 'Her soul was destroyed that first night, with those 11 men,' explains Dr Chirsanov. 'She used to resist, spitting and pulling the clients' hair, but they thought it was all part of some erotic game. She was crying out, \"I don't want to do this\", and they just laughed at her, amusing themselves. After which she got into thinking that she was the one who was insane and that this was what the world is like. That the people doing this to her were normal and she was insane to be unhappy about it.' Most of the girls, when they return, says Dr Chirsanov, 'speak of their desire to die. We had a case of one minor who had jumped from a sixth-floor window... she survived, after six surgical operations.'</p> <p>There is a glaring problem in calling what happened to Viorica, or any trafficked woman or girl, 'prostitution', since the word can imply a degree of consent. 'Here, there is absolutely no meaningful consent at all,' says Sian Jones, co-ordinator for the Balkans at Amnesty International. 'It is clear that if you knowingly have sex with a woman who has been trafficked, that is rape.'</p> <p>'There is no consent in sex with a trafficked woman,' says Denise Marshall, who runs the Poppy Project in south London, Britain's only shelter for trafficked women. 'If a trafficked woman is forced to see 30 clients a day, so far as I am concerned, that is 30 rapes a day. The impact on the body and on the psyche is the same as rape. It is the same level of violence against that woman.' </p> <p>A website called www.punternet.com offers an insight into these clients' heads. It invites entries from men comparing notes on prostitutes. On occasions, there is every indication that the woman visited is trafficked and that the client knows this. 'Worst shag of my life,' laments one entry, 'the girl was a robot - felt sorry for her - kept thinking why is she doing this? - she said only a couple of words to me - gave me 10 mins of hand job while looking the other way and jumping when I tried to touch her - she lay down trying to cover her tits - 15 mins with me trying to grab her ... Why does she do it? I probably can guess.'</p> <p>When politicians turn their attention to trafficking and prostitution - as the British Home Office is now doing - little attention is paid to the 'demand' side, to the punters. </p> <p>The debate is most advanced in Sweden, from where money has been pumped into counter-trafficking abroad and legislation enacted at home, in 1999, attempting to fight trafficking by tackling all use of prostitutes. 'The problem of demand has been engaged here by criminalising the buying of sexual services,' says Nina Strandberg, East Europe area manager for Sida. 'Basically, that means it is not illegal for a woman to sell sex, but it is illegal for a man to buy it. It's an interesting position, introduced as something we regard as integral to the battle against trafficking.' According to Stockholm police, the measure has cut by more than two-thirds the number of prostitutes being operated in the city, with 754 convictions from 1999 until this summer, and fines imposed. </p> <p>'The Swedish law is controversial, but until countries of destination for these women and girls have some kind of legislation in place, we cannot begin to address the matter of trafficking,' says Steve Ashby. 'Prosecution of traffickers is not enough - another will always take his place. But if there were tighter laws on demand, then a lot of the so-called punters would think twice before they accepted the risk.'</p> <p>'The Swedish measure would make a great difference if it was more widespread,' says Lesko. 'It targets the right people - not the girls who come back damaged, but the people who damage them.'</p> <p>'This matter of trafficking,' says Giovanna Barberis, 'is becoming of dramatic concern. And yet I do not see governments in Western Europe wanting to address and find solutions to this issue. In some places, there does not appear to be any political will at all. There are many countries in Europe which have not even thought to undertake a serious assessment or analysis.'</p> <p>The 45 member states of the Council of Europe are currently drafting a convention on trafficking, providing an opportunity for binding minimum standards for the protection of and support for trafficked people. Most governments - including Britain's - tip-toe, however, confusing the issue with smuggling and migration, and are wary of the political liability in any discourse on arrivals from Eastern Europe. Within the Home Office, there are conflicting interests, between immigration services, which put a priority on removing people without proper documentation, and law enforcement, which requires willing witnesses and intelligence to prosecute traffickers.</p> <p>A triumvirate of organisations - Unicef, Amnesty International and Anti-Slavery International - campaign for three basic standards to be met by the European convention. They are: first, support, shelter and safety provision for women who emerge as having been trafficked. Second, a minimum period during which women can decide whether they want to co-operate with police investigations. (Protection at the Poppy Project, now funded by the Home Office, is conditional on agreeing to help the police. Italy has the most advanced legislation to date, with a 90-day allowance for reflection, and now suggests a six-month reflection period.) Third, resident permits - temporary or permanent - should be on offer in the country of destination 'whenever there is reasonable likelihood that a trafficked person will be subject to re-trafficking or other serious harm'. Italy already has such a system, which has proven effective not only in terms of protecting victims, but also in prosecuting traffickers.</p> <p>Britain's record is different. In autumn 2003, London and Tirana signed a bilateral agreement on repatriation to Albania of girls or women found to have been trafficked. 'I cannot respect a policy of repatriation,' says Vera Lesko. 'Since that year, I've had 16 girls sent back from Britain, 14 of whom have since been re-trafficked back into the system. Is it really so hard for you to take 16 people?'</p> <p>Mike Kaye of Anti-Slavery International argues that 'there is no conflict between protection and prosecution'. Quite apart from respect for the human rights of a person who has had them destroyed, he says, 'Protection of trafficked people three distinct advantages: it disrupts the trafficking system, because they do not get re-trafficked; it favours intelligence, because they are more likely to tell the support agency how they were trafficked; and in the long or medium term, it means that the trafficked person is more likely to co-operate with the police.'</p> <p>'What really irritates me,' says Denise Marshallat the Poppy Project, 'is that governments - not just the UK - put the responsibility on to the country where these women originate. The fact is this: if British men were not wanting sex with trafficked women, then trafficked women would not be here. I had a woman who was raped 88 times - no, not 18, 88 - on Christmas Day 2002. She is completely annihilated. She is a religious woman who dares not go to church. She has a child but does not think she deserves to see that child. The men who did that to her were British, and I think Britain has a responsibility to provide her with at least sometime and proper resources. There are no quick-fix solutions for a woman like that.'</p> <p>Eva, from southern Albania, fell in love with the man who took her to Naples, promising a wedding. But on arrival, her fiance demanded that Eva work for him as a prostitute. 'When I protested, he said he would kill my family and that his accomplices back home would do the same thing to my sister.' The trafficker worked alongside a 'group of his friends' while Eva and other girls enslaved into their operation walked the streets of Naples, taking up to 20 clients a night to meet her quota, and, if lucky, avoid a beating. Most nights, however, would end with her being violated and beaten by her trafficker and his accomplices.</p> <p>'I could see people living their normal lives,' she says, her eyes staring into mid-distance - 'shopping, going about their business. They had their families and children with them, they had their lives, they had all the things I wanted but could never have. It made my heart cry to see them. Instead, I became accustomed to being a slave, crying all the time, but always afraid to leave him,because he knew my family, he knew my sister. I was alone, I had no one.'</p> <p>Eva's trafficker was brother to one of Albania's biggest dealers in drugs and women, who was killed in a car crash. Eva duly managed to escape when her trafficker returned to Tirana for the funeral, successfully seeking out one of her brothers, living in Venice. </p> <p>Eva, who wears a cross around her neck, has two distinct and different faces: the one she wears when telling her story hitherto - bounden, staring blankly - and another, which comes suddenly alive, effervescent, when she gets to this point in her narrative. In Savona, she met her sister-in-law, an evangelical Christian, who took Eva to church and to see a film about Mary Magdalene, the reformed prostitute. 'She saved my life,' says Eva, 'a certain peace came into me. I began to think differently and became a believer. My fear left me. I realised that people judge you, but God can forgive everything.' </p> <p>Now living in hiding from reprisal, as does her sister, Eva is clearly the life force of the shelter in which she lives. 'For the moment, I have what I want. I have my sister with me, I tidy up, I plant flowers, I sew.' But Eva also urges her fellow victims and those still captive, out there in the hell of enslavement, whence she returned: 'I tell them, do not be afraid to do what is right. Go to the police. Testify against those who exploit you, for they deserve to be punished.' </p> <p>All names of trafficked women and children in this article have been changed for their own safety.

  "<p>Snowboarding, bless its thermal socks, didn't really have the easiest of upbringings. For a start, its biological father has never been confidently identified: was it Jack Burchett, who in 1929 rustled together a crude snowboard with a plank of wood, some rope and horse reins for bindings? Or Sherman Poppen, whose prototype 'Snurfer' in 1965 was originally a gift for his daughter Wendy, but went on to shift half-a-million boards the following year? </p> <p>Either way, early childhood was problematic. In a world dominated by officiously minted skiers, snowboarding went down like a bad joke: initial designs were modelled on surfboards right down to the tail fins (useless in everything but deep powder), and snowboarders were ridiculed as wannabe surf dudes way out of their depth. In most resorts they were banned outright, while places that allowed them forbade use of the lifts, as their non-release bindings failed to comply with the industry standards for ski equipment safety. </p> <p>So it was that snowboarding's anti-social tendencies were fostered from an early age; denied the pristine pistes of their more affluent Alpine cohabitees, snowboarders became pack animals with unofficial diplomas in backcountry DIY, huddled in groups, hiking the soft stuff and building terrain of their own. Snowboarding gathered an outlaw momentum quickly picked up on by the youth media; punk rock and skater style gave their mountain migration a worldwide momentum, and pretty soon the size of snowboarders' pants was beaten only by the size of their ramps. </p> <p>Attitude and altitude combined and, as an aggressive adolescent, snowboarding began to break free from its patronising stepfather (the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Ski), its catalogue of ever more insane tricks and powder lines making most skiers feel understandably middle-aged. But not any more: if anything, the image of freestyle skiing these days has made commendable progress, looking and sounding exactly like snowboarding did more than 10 years ago - from the dyed dreds down to the oversized threads. Skiers have infiltrated snowboard parks across the world (now called 'terrain parks' so as not to upset anybody), and have even adopted many of snowboarding's signature moves, from rodeo flips to rail slides, the latter especially coming under a regular barrage of ridicule from boarders. </p> <p>Politically correct tendencies aside, however, terrain parks remain snowboard-oriented affairs, much improved by recently increased investment and a range of specialist shaping equipment (the mighty Zaugg Pipe Monster, for example). </p> <p>The prevailing 'no falls, no balls' attitude of yesteryear has all but evaporated, and most parks contain at least a smattering of entry-level kickers and rails, if not an entirely separate beginners' area. Throw in a sizeable sound system, an on-site bar and a team of professional shapers, and you can see why so many snowboarders invest in reduced-fare, park-only lift passes for their trip. Europe is home to some world-class parks. </p> <p><strong> France</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Tignes</strong> has always been a popular choice with beginners, home as it is to a downsized half-pipe (always best in the first few weeks of the season, as the sun quickly takes the edge off it), a wide variety of smaller ramps and rails and a famously relaxed atmosphere (the communal barbecue certainly helps). The Tignes park is located on the Carline piste in Val Claret, although advanced riders are recommended to head for the Bellevarde/La Daille sector of neighbouring <strong> Val d'Is\u00e8re</strong>, where a decidedly more trouser-filling selection of obstacles awaits, including a burly boardercross course, two opposing quarter-pipes and a truly intimidating 30-metre tabletop jump. </p> <p><strong> Avoriaz</strong> is another firm favourite with the freestyle fraternity, and with good reason. It's not only the local architecture that's forward-thinking; the Arare snowpark was set up in 1993 - a year when most European resort managers still imagined half-pipes to be a kind of unsavoury drug paraphernalia - and to this day it continues to offer some of the biggest and best-shaped modules around, all of them perfectly situated to soak up the afternoon sun. </p> <p>Avoriaz is also home to the La Chappelle snowpark - better suited to beginners - and a park specially designed for the emerging sport of snowskating, of which locals Nico Droz and Sebastian 'Paco' Raban are emerging inter national ambassadors. France's best introduction to snowboarding, however, comes via the Kommunity summer camps in <strong>Les Deux Alpes</strong>. Run by UK snowboard legend Neil McNab, the camps have a British flavour, offering a non-pressure riding environment (with a huge variety of recreational apr\u00e8s-ski activities, from rock climbing to white-water rafting), and catering for a range of abilities, all coming under the expert eye of renowned UK riders like Jenny Jones, Gary Greenshields and Adam Gendle. The snowpark in Les Deux Alpes is also first-rate. </p> <p><strong> Switzerland</strong><br> </p> <p> Switzerland doesn't offer quite the same abundance of terrain, but <strong>Saas-Fee</strong> is a bustling hub of rider-related shenanigans all the same. This is never more apparent than during the post-season slush, when the Ice Ripper spring and summer camps (<a href=\"http://www.iceripper.com\">iceripper.com)</a> descend on the glacier for week-long snowboarding beanos, with hotels, lift passes and professional tuition included in the package, and with regular piss-ups at the notorious Popcorn Bar as standard. </p> <p><strong> Les Diablerets</strong> (00 41 024 492 3481, <a href=\"http://www.diablerets.ch\">diablerets.ch</a>) is a perfect spot for riders to stretch their legs in late autumn. There is a good range of ramps and rails - many of them suited to beginners - at the James B snowboard camp, which opens in October and operates from the Mon Abri dormitory, home of the infamous B-bar (<a href=\"http://www.monabri.ch\">monabri.ch</a> ). </p> <p><strong> Italy</strong><br> </p> <p> Italy's most snowboard-friendly resort is <strong>Livigno</strong>, and its extensive snowboard park - on the far side of the Mottolina gondola - sets an epic stage for the formidable Burton European Open freestyle contest each January. </p> <p><strong> Germany</strong><br> </p> <p> Germany, meanwhile, may not be renowned for its world-class terrain, but it has an excellent park at <strong> Garmisch-Partenkirchen</strong> (00 49 8821 180 700, <a href=\"http://www.garmisch-partenkirchen.de\">garmisch-partenkirchen.de</a>), and also hosts some top-notch summer camps courtesy of Gap 1328 (00 49 8821 52247, <a href=\"http://www.gap1328.de\">gap1328.de</a>). Bear in mind, however, that the resort isn't glacial, and the snow can be slushy. </p> <p><strong> Austria</strong><br> </p> <p> While Austria is best known for its extensive powder fields and immaculately groomed slopes, it also has some cracking parks: from the dramatic Skyline Park in <strong> Nordpark</strong>, just out of Innsbruck, to a variety of freestyle terrains in <strong> Mayrhofen</strong>, including the Penken Park and the 360m-long super-pipe on the Hintertux Glacier. </p> <p>Of course, a list such as this can never be comprehensive: most resorts these days have some sort of terrain park, and while individual set-ups will always have unique personalities - reflections of the shapers who shape them, the riders who shred them and the resort itself - if you've ridden one great park, you can pretty much guess what the next one will be like. </p> <p><strong> Finland</strong><br> </p> <p> There are still some rare gems out there, rough and uncut and offering more than just big speakers and well-sculpted landings. <strong> Talma</strong> (00 358 9274 5410, <a href=\"http://www.talmaski.fi\">talmaski.fi</a>), in Finland, has become something of a mecca for more fanatical snowboarders, rumoured as it is to have sold its soul to the satan of progressive freestyle. Despite Talma's diminutive scale (the hill itself - for mountain it most certainly is not - resembles a sort of oversized Xscape without the sanitised electric lighting), this tiny hamlet has produced some of professional snowboarding's most valued players over the last few years, including Jussi Oksanen, Heikki Sorsa and Wille Yli Luoma. </p> <p>Since then, riders have been flocking from around the world to sample the well-shaped kickers, soak up the small town atmosphere (the slopes don't open until 4pm on weekdays) and try to locate the source of all this seemingly inexplicable talent. </p> <p><strong> Norway</strong><br> </p> <p> For a road even less travelled, make a post-season pit stop at the <strong> Folgefonna</strong> summer camp in Norway (00 47 328 26000, <a href=\"http://www.folgefonna.no\">folgefonna.no</a>). Winters here are dark and depressing (and the cause of much aneurysm-inspiring black metal music), but summer is one long celebration, and the extreme northern latitude makes for roughly 20 hours of sunlight daily, with riding until the wee hours in an eerie perpetual twilight. </p> <p>Camp accommodation - five kilometres (three miles) from the small town of Jondalen - is rustic to say the least, but the sparseness of the place is half the charm. Expect jagged backdrops, misty mountain lakes and a notable absence of tourists - plus some of the friendliest people, best-shaped park facilities and, unfortunately, most overpriced pints you'll ever come across. </p> <p><strong> Iceland</strong><br> </p> <p> For the real back of beyond, however, it has to be the Iceland Park Project (<a href=\"http://www.icelandparkproject.com\">icelandparkproject.com</a>), set up in 2002 by a small team (including Glaswegian snowboarder and professional shaper Graham MacVoy), disillusioned with the stresses, strains and steadily diminishing soul of big-park riding and looking to set up a venture of their own somewhere more out of the way. And it doesn't get much more out of the way than IPP, straddling the <strong> Snaefells Glacier</strong> that inspired H.G. Wells to write Journey to the Centre of the Earth. You can forget about five-star restaurants and en suite PlayStations - there aren't even any lifts, as hiking is part and parcel of the Icelandic experience - but for a riding retreat with rewards as much spiritual as they are sports-related, IPP is in a league of its own. </p> <p><strong> Competitive thrills</strong><br> </p> <p> Turn up at these parks on any given day and you're guaranteed to see some astonishing riders pushing the boundaries of amplitude (see glossary at the bottom), hucking themselves off bigger kickers, soaring out of steeper pipes and stomping tricks sicker than anything you'll see on telly. But for the most memorable and dramatic display of skills, you'll want to get yourself along to one of Europe's premier snowboarding competitions. With rider performance so reliant on good visibility and clean, well-sculpted ramps, unpredictable winter weather can often put a bit of a dampener on things, but even then the after-show parties are some of the biggest and most booze-fuelled you'll ever not quite remember. </p> <p>One that's garnered a well-earned reputation for debauchery is the annual <strong> Snowbombing</strong> festival (<a href=\"http://www.snowbombing.com\">snowbombing.com</a>), claiming to offer 'boarding by day and beats by night', but in reality featuring DJs spinning till long after sunrise and leaving most punters reeling (or just plain sleeping) until late afternoon. Closer to the roots of snowboarding is the <strong> Verbier Extreme</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.xtremeverbier.com\">xtremeverbier.com</a>), which pits the world's most fearless backcountry riders against a chopper-drop powder face peppered with intimidating cliffs and chutes. </p> <p>And at the other end of the scale is the UK's homegrown <strong> AIM Series</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.aimseries.com\">aimseries.com</a> the qualifiers for which are staged at dry slopes and indoor snowdomes across the country, culminating in the annual British Championships in France. </p> <p>But few of these contests are self-contained events. Since the collapse of the International Snowboarding Federation (ISF) in 2002, the professional circuit has been dominated by the <strong> Ticket To Ride</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.ttrprosnowboarding.com\">www.ttrprosnowboarding.com</a>), a series of 'by rider, for rider' events leading up to the infamous Arctic Challenge. This end-of-season showdown, in the wilderness of Lofoten, Norway, is snowboarding's answer to the World Cup final, and it's similarly hard to secure tickets. </p> <p><strong>How to speak snowboard</strong></p> <p>It won't help you nail your first cab 900 (two-and-a-half rotations), but a rudimentary knowledge of snowboarder speak might stop you looking like a hopeless dork when it comes to buttering up the locals. </p> <p><strong>Amplitude</strong> A given rider's degree of sickness (see below). Most usually corresponds to the height of a particular trick.</p> <p><strong>Claiming</strong> Unnecessarily congratulating oneself on stomping a trick, either verbally or with immediate celebratory body language.</p> <p><strong>Corked</strong> A trick executed with off-axis, or inverted rotation. Often engaged accidentally, resulting in hospitalisation.</p> <p><strong>Garage sale</strong> The redistribution of equipment (goggles flying one way, gloves and hat another) that follows a bad fall: a recurrent problem with back-country spin cycles.</p> <p><strong>Hucking</strong> The act of launching oneself from a ramp, off a cliff or out of a pipe; group pursuits of the same are known as 'huckfests', 'jams' or 'sessions'.</p> <p><strong>Jibbing</strong> Shredding something other than snow, eg rails, rocks or cars.</p> <p><strong>Scorpion</strong> A kind of unintentional faceplant in which your legs rear up behind you and your board cracks the back of your head. Worthy follow-up to a tindy.</p> <p><strong>Shred</strong> To ride hard, to 'schralp'. A safe bet for skiers trying to look like snowboarders, as in: 'Dude, did you see me shred the rad/schralp the gnar back there?'</p> <p><strong>Sick</strong> An oft-heard cry of encouragement, as in: 'That cab underflip was sick' or 'Danny is such a sick rider'.</p> <p><strong>Sketchy</strong> A graceless and uncontrolled trick or landing; can also be applied to people's general outlooks on life (especially those who 'claim' tricks, or who actually say things like 'shred the rad/ schralp the gnar').</p> <p><strong>Spin cycle</strong> Involuntary cartwheels caused by coming a cropper on steep off-piste.</p> <p><strong>Steez</strong> Style. You have it or you don't.</p> <p><strong>Stomping</strong> To land solidly and with perfect control; also to 'stick', 'nail' or 'dial' a trick.</p> <p><strong>Tindy</strong> A hideous variation on the standard indy grab (grabbing the tail, rather than between the feet) by kids that don't know any better. Categorically low on steez.</p> <p><strong>Tweaked</strong> The emphasis of style in a given trick, usually involving a long and pronounced grab; also 'boned'.</p> <p><strong>1260</strong> The world record for most rotations in the air by a snowboarder (three and a half), which was set by Canadian rider Marc Andre Tarte at last year's Air and Style contest in Innsbruck.</p> <p><strong>Winding down the windows</strong> A spasmodic flapping of the arms mid-air that signifies excess amplitude. Often followed by a particularly painful scorpion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>To order a copy of Time Out Skiing &amp; Snowboarding in Europe for \u00a38.99 go to <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/shop\">timeout.com/shop</a></p>",

If the friendly bombers diverted overhead, en route to Slough, the rest of the capital - of the country - would doubtless applaud.</p> <p>Worse, E&amp;O is a fashionable restaurant in a fashionable district, frequented by supermodels who exist on Marlboro Lights and the glare of the lens, trustafarians and liggers, pop stars you've never heard of and some you have, and girls with pencilled eyebrows like circumflexes who do something pointless in PR. Worse still, the menu at E&amp;O is pan-Asian. I would rather stick my tongue in a live plug socket than pay my own money for that stuff (which is why I use The Observer's). In short, it is fair to say that when I went to E&amp;O I was attempting to do nothing more than reinforce my prejudices.</p> <p>It almost hurts, therefore, to have to tell you that the reason it's hard to get a table is that it's good. Not 'you won't believe what I ate last night' amazing. Just good. Yes, there is a noisy bar full of people you would happily herd into a barb-wired enclosure. But the dining room is away from all that and, with its smart use of dark slatted wood panels on the walls and cosy booths, it is a pleasing place to be. The waiters are nice; the prices, while hardly cheap, do not feel like larceny; and the food is sensible. The kitchen clearly understands that if you are going to mix culinary traditions from across Asia, there is an imperative to get the fundamentals right.</p> <p>So a Japanese tuna tartare, beautifully presented in a bowl made of a solid piece of ice, made a virtue of very fresh fish and the careful application of citrus. And nothing else. Chewy pork spare ribs, in a sweet, dark sauce with a light chilli lift, would not have disgraced the better establishments in Chinatown, and the half of glossy, crispy-skinned duck - which had benefited from long rendering - would have been an ornament to many of them. Black cod in sweet miso, which came apart in fine pearly flakes, was just as good as at Nobu, where the dish was made famous, but required rather less than the Kensington mortgage needed at Nobu to pay for it.</p> <p>A main-course pad Thai made no efforts to innovate. It was just a good, solid pad Thai. I also liked the Asian greens with their assertive, garlicky kick, and a softer side dish of stir-fried mushrooms on ho fun - flat noodles - which was rich and satisfying. E&amp;O is not, it should be said, the place for puddings. The lemongrass creme brulee proved only that there is no point in adding to a dish which is fine as it is, the flavouring lending a grim medicinal edge. But it is the place for a relaxed dinner and, damn it, I would happily go again. And pay my own money. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Restaurants Against Hunger week begins 9 October - dozens of restaurants across the country will invite diners to make a donation as they pay the bill.

  "<p>More men should wear pink. I am not referring to fuchsia or acid pinks - the equivalent of wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt - but your old-fashioned Wall's strawberry ice-cream colour. I agree that on some men it's a colour that just doesn't suit, but on the whole, men look good in softer hues. </p> <p>As with all fashions, there are a few rules: avoid ending up like a City boy trying to do casual; never go near the combination of ruffles and pink; keep it classic and simple. Pink needs to be either dressed slightly down with a white T-shirt underneath a crisp shirt, or mixed with a subtle colour palette that tones it down - a grey jumper or camel cord jacket. It works well with old worn jeans and trainers, or a favourite worn-in pair of brogues and under a heavy navy winter coat - as cool as an off-set actor, Jude Law style (now there's a man that can do pink).</p> <p>This season, pink has cropped up throughout the menswear shows with simple pieces like the crewneck jumper by Moschino, or from our own British designer, Paul Smith, who has shirts in every shade. For something a bit more off-beat, logo T-shirts are a safe option - mixing soft colours with a harder logo. </p> <p>The Duffer of St George (020 7836 3722) is thinking pink, with shirts, jumpers and T-shirts for formal and casualwear. At Harvey Nichols (020 7235 5000) alone, you can choose from Nigel Hall's candy-coloured shirts, Iceberg's T-shirt and jumpers in a whole spectrum of pinks, and John Smedley's classic knits in pale pink. And for the ultimate in luxury, at Yves Saint Laurent (020 7235 6706) you will find baby-pink cashmere. So why not get in touch with your feminine side, and wear the shirt to prove it?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jo.adams@observer.co.uk\">jo.adams@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "One in three foreign students applying to enter Britain is being rejected in a clampdown that experts fear could force the closure of some of the hundreds of universities and colleges that rely on overseas fees. <p>They believe genuine students are being refused kept out of the country in a drive to cut visa fraud by illegal immigrants at UK universities and language schools.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has defended the clampdown, insisting that only bogus students are being denied entry but others are sceptical, pointing to recent National Audit Office findings that 24 per cent of the refusals are overturned on appeal.</p> <p>The findings come after The Observer uncovered a 'degrees-for-sale' scandal in August that revealed cash-strapped British universities are so desperate to attract the lucrative overseas market they are awarding degrees to foreign students who should be failed.</p> <p>According to UKvisas, the joint Foreign Office-Home Office agency that processes applications, 52,520 requests - almost 30 per cent - for student visas were refused in 2003-2003, a rise of 13,647 over the previous year. </p> <p>The number of people from outside the European Union arriving in the UK on student visas fell by 14 per cent to 318,630 in 2003, the Home Office statistics show. In addition, figures from the National Audit Office have revealed the refusal rate for student visas is twice that of tourist visas and more than four times that of work visas.</p> <p>Since the mid-1990s, the number of foreign students coming to Britain has risen from nearly 7,000 to more than 33,000; a rise encouraged by the government in its bid to court the estimated \u00a3600 million non-EU students bring into the country.</p> <p>Acceptance rates of visa applications varied widely across the world but the highest number of refused requests, 14,331, came from South Asia in 2002-2003, while almost half of applications from equatorial Africa were rejected.</p>"
