  "<p>What are people queuing at the Fringe box office buying tickets for? </p> <p><strong>Elizabeth and Rebecca Borne, Louisiana:</strong> We're on vacation and didn't realise this was going on. We arrived yesterday and got flyers handed to us everywhere. We are going to see Women of Troy, Women of War at Old St Paul's Church, which looks kind of cool. And one we might go see tonight is by Harold Pinter, 'cause he's pretty famous. No Man's Land, I think that's what it was called. It's hard to decide, but it's exciting. </p> <p><strong>Hazel Davies, Edinburgh:</strong> The Ignatius Trail at the Smirnoff Underbelly. My grandsons picked the show. I just take them and pay for it. I get to go because I get concessions and my daughter-in-law doesn't. </p> <p><strong>Kay Diaz, London:</strong> In a Month of Fallen Sundays at the Gilded Balloon. One of the actresses was giving flyers away. I take chances. </p> <p><strong>Sjoerd Spoelstra, Holland:</strong> We're going to Bill Shakespeare's Italian Job at the Gilded Balloon and Auld Reekie's Haunted Underground City Experience. We picked at random because it's most fun that way. <br> </p> <p><strong>Mark Zenobia, New Jersey: </strong> It's my first time. We've only been here two hours and have bought tickets for Borge Again! at the Assembly Rooms, and a Japanese thingy at the Garage. I love Victor Borge. He was very funny. </p> <p><strong>Katherine Whiteley, Vancouver Island:</strong> Nunsense at 1/4rm @ Greenside and Catastrophe at Culloden at C cubed. The first show is about frantic fundraising nuns, and I have an ancestor who died at Culloden, so I'm going to the second show in honour of him. </p> <p><strong>Judie Keane, New Mexico:</strong> Ladyboys of Bangkok at Meadows Theatre Big Tops. I wanted to see something big and spectacular. A friend went last year and said it was fantastic. </p> <p><strong>Myrtle Bridgeman, Edinburgh:</strong> Tao - Beat of the Globe at the Assembly Rooms. I liked the picture in the programme. It's about Japanese drumming and it looks very energetic. I have aspirations to be a drummer. </p> <p><strong>Donna Finley, Calagary:</strong> D-D-D-Don't Mention the Disability at Co2 venue. Our son has a close friend who has a stutter, so we want to see it. </p> <p><strong>Sandy Gordon, Los Angeles:</strong> Peddling Stories at the Pleasance Courtyard, which is about John Bishop's journey round Australia. My daughter spent six months there.</p>",
  "<p>A Channel Islands airline which takes thousands of passengers to Guernsey and Jersey every summer has been chastised by the safety regulator for its \"inappropriate\" management arrangements. </p> <p>Aurigny, which is owned by the government of Guernsey and expects to carry 550,000 people this year, was reprimanded over its handling of an incident last November in which one of its planes ran into trouble over the Channel. </p> <p>The aircraft began to lose power en route to Stansted after becoming covered with ice. The first officer tried to reduce altitude but struggled to retain control as the plane pitched and rolled. </p> <p>According to an inquiry by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, staff later failed to report the incident, did not collect \"black box\" evidence and only looked over the plane before allowing it to fly again. </p> <p>The report criticised \"the continued use of an aircraft with a serviceability status not confirmed by an appropriate engineering inspection\". </p> <p>It said Aurigny allowed a data recording box in the cockpit to be overwritten, in breach of air navigation regulations, and because the flight was at a weekend, senior management were not informed for 48 hours. The AAIB said Aurigny had inadequate procedures for responding to technical incidents. There was \"no formal management contact procedure\" and no \"duty manager\". </p> <p>Founded in 1968, Aurigny has nearly 300 staff and a fleet of 15 aircraft. It flies from Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney to mainland airports. </p> <p>The airline was \"renationalised\" by Guernsey's government last year for \u00a36m. The buyout, intended to safeguard links to the mainland, was attacked as unfair state aid by rivals such as FlyBe, which pointed out that it would have been illegal if Guernsey was part of the European Union. </p> <p>In a statement, Aurigny said it had \"reviewed and reinforced\" its procedures since the incident, acknowledging that staff ought to have kept the flight's black box recorder.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Trans-Siberian rip-off?</strong></p> <p>My wife and I want to travel from Moscow to Beijing next year, stopping off at a couple of other places in Russia and in Mongolia. The cost of the trip seems to be about \u00a3400, yet every tour firm I have spoken to charges well over \u00a31,000 for the package. </p> <p>I know they organise visas and transfers, but there seems to be a huge mark-up. One company quoted \u00a3120 a night for a hotel in Beijing, which I then found on the internet for \u00a330.</p> <p>How can we book direct, and is it easy to find day trips, home stays and excursions when we get there?<br><strong> Jeremy Michael, London</strong></p> <p>It's possible to organise your own Trans-Siberian trip if you have time and patience - this is often the cheapest way. You will, however, have to organise visas, accommodation and tickets, which often drives people to use the UK's excellent trans-Siberian tour firms.</p> <p>Train tickets are the main problem. If you pitch up at Yaroslavl station in Moscow you can buy tickets to any destination. The second-class Moscow to Beijing fare starts at around \u00a3120.</p> <p>But it isn't possible to purchase a hop-on, hop-off ticket for any of the trans-Siberian routes, so you must get tickets as you go along. Those for international trains through Mongolia and China can sell out months in advance. However, you can use a Russian travel agency to book your train travel. Try <a href=\"http://www.waytorussia.net\">Way to Russia</a>. You can then arrange hotels and visas as you please. Excursions, home stays and visits to Mongolian gers (traditional houses) can all be arranged on the road. Speaking some Russian will help.

We want two nights' self-catering accommodation with lots to keep the guests occupied: hill walking, an indoor pool, tennis, karaoke, dressing up and the like. </p> <p>Most of the guests are couples, so we don't really want a dormitory. The most we want to pay is about \u00a360 per head for both nights (with food extra). The place must be easy to reach from London and Manchester. </p> <p>We can't find anywhere that takes many more than about 20 adults. Have you any suggestions?<br><strong>Dougal Hutchison, by email</strong></p> <p>The size of your group means you're to some extent into the territory of weddings and conferences, in which case you'll need to spend more than you have in mind. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thebigdomain.com\">The Big Domain</a> (01326 240028) specialises in properties for large groups, including the luxurious Walcott House in Shropshire and Bracken Bank Lodge in Cumbria.

We plan to finish our trip by flying back to the UK from Miami just before Christmas, and we would like to spend some time in the Caribbean before we return. Is it possible to find cheap, hostel-type accommodation on the Caribbean islands, and have you any advice on obtaining cheap air or sea travel between islands?<br><strong>Paul Griffiths, north London</strong></p> <p>The Caribbean is a big region, and the options vary from island to island. Generally, it is not a budget travel destination, and where cheap accommodation exists it is in guest houses rather than backpacker hostels, and normally in towns rather than idyllic beach areas. The places are clean and functional, but don't expect any resort-type frills. </p> <p>Barbados, Trinidad, Dominica and St Lucia are all good places to find guest houses, which charge under \u00a320 a night. Check the official tourist websites for these islands for details. </p> <p>Getting around will also be more costly than you'll have been used to. There are some reasonably priced inter-island ferries, mostly in the Grenadines and around the French islands. </p> <p>Air travel between the islands can be expensive, but there are some good deals around including passes with the main regional airline <a href=\"http://www.fly-liat.com\">LIAT</a> which can take you around a few islands for as little as \u00a3125. </p> <p><strong>US waiver muddle</strong></p> <p> My husband and I flew to Atlanta via Detroit with the US airline Northwest. On arrival our passports had the usual green visa waiver stapled to them. </p> <p>On our return journey, also via Detroit, we did not go through any passport control, so we still have the waivers in our passports, though we should have surrendered them on leaving the US. This may delay our entry next time we go to visit our son in Atlanta. Can we surrender the waivers in the UK?<br><strong>Jenny Hydes, Louth</strong></p> <p>If you still have the waiver, you are likely to show up on the official system next time as having overstayed a visa. </p> <p>The US Embassy in London, which has a visa line on 09055 444546, advises you to assemble a copy of the visa form, the biographical data page of your passport, your boarding pass for the return flight home if you still have it and evidence that you have lived in the UK since your last visit. Send these to ACS-USCIS, SBU, PO Box 7125, London, KY 40742-7125, USA. You won't get an acknowledgment, so keep copies of all your correspondence and take them on your next US trip. </p> <p>It might seem like a lot of hassle, and you might be tempted just to rip out the visa form and hope for the best, but in the current climate it's essential to show you've done the correct thing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> We welcome letters.

  "<p>When I was very young, when the Acropolis seemed so remote as to be unreal, I thought that when I grew up I would probably live in Kent. Then The Observer intervened. A decision was made to dispatch its Middle East correspondent, my father, from London to Cyprus. By way of that fractured corner of the Levant I came to Greece. </p> <p>That was 18 years ago and in that time the great, big, old, new rambunctious Athena and I have sort of grown up together. We have both matured, both changed. Though time means nothing to Athena - for that is what she teaches you first, the concept of eternity - it has, in her case, been awfully kind. </p> <p>This year Athens turned 171 as the capital of modern Greece. Before that, it was a malaria-ridden outpost; a grid of grimy streets, with just one church, on the forgotten fringes of the Ottoman Empire. And many moons before that, conscientious Roman tourists were traipsing about Plaka and Adrianou, the road I now live on, no doubt feeling like hollow copies of the classical Greeks who first elected to put the place on the map. </p> <p>Even when you hate Athens - and there are times when I love it and loathe it in equal measure - there's no denying that it has had countless, hidden lives. Each has brought reinvention. The city that is about to host the 2004 Olympic Games is but one of them. </p> <p>If you are not a classics buff, your first taste of Athens is usually the de rigueur stop-over en route to the isles. Like most, I had this stereotypical experience. </p> <p>Even now I have vivid, almost visceral, memories of the breathless anticipation that bonded travellers as the train (for we were Inter-Railers then) pulled into the capital's benighted station: would there be a bus, or taxi, to get us down to the port as soon as possible and onto the very next boat out of Piraeus? Who, after all, would want to spend any time in a town tormented by smog, heat, congestion and a collective lack of politesse? In Athens, even the old ladies seemed angry. </p> <p>Back then, of course, I had no idea of Athens's well-kept secrets: its inimitable, ever-changing light; noisy, neighbourhood tavernas; its gaiety and natural atmospheric effects. Back then it had more of the Balkan than European about it, a city that spoke to Western visitors but invariably fell short of the idealised image most had. But back then, I was blind. </p> <p>To say that Athens has changed is to understate the fact. No EU capital has been as transformed or injected with such gargantuan amounts of cash. Since being awarded the Olympiad in 1997, around \u00a326 billion has been pumped into public infrastructure projects. Although all too often eclipsed by the chaos that has surrounded preparations, these are works that have revitalised Athens as never before - and will outlive the Olympics for years to come. </p> <p>Some might say that the city has always been in transition; that change is in its blood. The uncontrollable influx of refugees who arrived in 1923 on the back of Greece's catastrophic Asia Minor campaign triggered the unseemly urban sprawl. In 1986, you could still spot those people moving out of their crumbling tenement refugee homes. From the crest of Hymettus and the other mountains surrounding Athens, villa after villa groped up the slopes in the race against the smog. Today the smog has practically disappeared. Somewhere back in the Nineties, the noxious nefos , the semi-permanent cloud of eye-smarting pollutants, went away. Walking the streets is now a joy. </p> <p>This vanishing act is all part of the increasingly unrecognisable face of Athens; the new visage that Greek officials hope to showcase when some 4.5 billion TV viewers tune into this month's Olympics. </p> <p>Back in the early Eighties, Greece's culture minister, the late actress Melina Mercouri, famously likened her beloved birthplace to an 'ugly lady'. It was true, she admitted, Athens was not particularly fetching, 'but just like many ugly women, she is also capable of immense charm'. </p> <p>Now even Mercouri, one of Athens's greatest champions - it was she who launched the campaign for the return of the Parthenon Marbles from the British Museum - might be shocked to see the extent of the transformation. </p> <p>When I first came to Athens, it was nigh impossible to squeeze into an electric trolley - an unpredictable locomotive whose tendency to come to a screeching halt made it as dangerous for pedestrians as for passengers. Now, Athenians are spoilt for choice: trams, trains, trolleys, tubes and ultra-modern buses are all at hand. </p> <p>The underground - an ever-expanding network that in 37 minutes connects the city centre with Athens's gleaming new airport - mixes efficiency with glamour. Depending on the hour, and taste of the station master, passengers walk to platforms accompanied by the sound of music. I have known many a dinner party to end up at the metro as proud residents guide visitors around its myriad archaeological displays. </p> <p>For me, though, the tram is the best of all the city's forms of transport. Perhaps because it was immortalised by so many Athenian film-makers back in the Fifties, no other mode of transport so encapsulates Athens's natural joie de vivre. Its return, 44 years after the last wooden tram trundled beneath the Acropolis, is all the more exciting for so effortlessly reuniting mainland Europe's southernmost city with the sea. </p> <p>After decades of the coastline being inaccessible to the public, esplanades peppered with marinas, parks and recreation centres now link up with boulevards - all part of another huge redevelopment programme. This is another of Athens's secrets, its Riviera. </p> <p>From the ancients through to the Grand Tourists and the likes of Henry Miller, writers have waxed lyrical about Attica's splendid locale. With its thyme-covered mountains, lush plains and coastal steeps, Athens, wrote Miller in The Colossus of Maroussi, his 1941 panegyric to Greece, had chosen a 'magnificent site in which to rear itself'. </p> <p>One of the biggest thrills about Athens is its proximity to the ocean. For years, I have taken undiluted delight in fleeing to the nearby islands of Aegina and Agistri (both curiously overlooked by tourists), not least because the latter has one of the best nudist beaches in Greece and some of its cleanest waters. </p> <p>Aegina, which offers fine seaside tavernas, endless pistachio orchards and fabulous walks, has long been a bolt-hole for Greek writers, poets and painters. For many years a wooden caique was the only form of transport that linked Agistri to the mainland. Now you scud over the Saronic Gulf in a hydrofoil that docks at the isle less than an hour later. </p> <p>There was a reason why, in the past, I often headed to these isles. At weekends, it seemed that if Athenians were not taking flight to the leafy and much cooler northern suburbs, they were flocking to the capital's Apollo Coast. The bottlenecks on the road to Sounio were such that you could go and come from Agistri in the time it took to get down to the Riviera. </p> <p>But the tram - and a web of new highways - has put paid to that. And thanks to waste-water treatment facilities, the coastal waters are not only turquoise but unexpectedly clean. Growing numbers of luxury hotels, including one of Greece's leading resorts, have been built on the road to Sounio. </p> <p>As a newcomer to the area I have been pleasantly surprised by its plethora of sandy coves and by the number of young Athenians availing themselves of the pleasures of private beaches along the stretch. At night, when Athens is especially vibrant, it comes alive with discos, bars-cum-nightclubs and eateries, such as the funky Island at Vouliagmeni. Indeed, Athens's worse traffic jams are often around 2am. </p> <p>All of this would have seemed impossible, even in the early Nineties, when the capital's visionary mayor, the late Antonis Tritsis, was accused of harbouring madcap ideas for even suggesting the tram could be reinstalled. Tritsis, an irrepressible progressive, was one of the first Greek politicians I got to know. I would sometimes join him on runs around the wooded periphery of Athens's original Olympic stadium (site of the Games's opening ceremony next week). He would point to the craggy Acropolis rock in the distance and explain how the Periclean masterpiece, and all of Athens's archaeological treasures would, one day, be united in a giant archaeological park. </p> <p>'Athens, you know, is a very beautiful city. It's all there waiting to be discovered.' I liked Tritsis, who had trained abroad as an urban planner, but at the time I remember thinking his ideas seemed overly Romantic and impossibly optimistic. </p> <p>The plan was so radical. It envisaged such a dramatic overhaul in the way Athens functioned that it was difficult to see how Athenians would ever tolerate the massive changes needed to get there. But I was wrong and Tritsis right: 14 years later, all of Athens's Golden Age wonders are linked by way of a cobbled causeway into one of Europe's most spectacular parks. </p> <p>The 2.5 kilometre walk starts on Dionyssiou Areopagitou, taking in unrivalled views of the Parthenon, pine-covered Philopappou hill, Saronic Gulf, Temple of Hephaestus and Keramikos cemetery along the way. Depending on which way you turn, you'll end up either in Gazi or in Psirri - Athens's own Soho with trendy bars, galleries, clubs and restaurants. Not that long ago, both of these feelgood areas seemed forbiddingly seedy, even if it had been in Psirri that Lord Byron chose to lodge, falling in love with Athens and perhaps more predictably his landlady's daughter. </p> <p>For me, no other single achievement stands as testimony to Athens's hopes and history as much as this promenade. With its foreign punters, blue-rinse pedestrians, youngsters and cultural gems, it symbolises the new, much more open Greece of the Olympic Games. </p> <p>When I walk it, 18 years after my Athenian adventure began, I have no regrets. Just euphoria - and a small sense of satisfaction - that Athena and I have come a long way, together.</p> <p><strong>Champion hotels and restaurants</strong></p> <p>The five best hotels:</p> <p><strong>Plaka Hotel</strong> (00 30 210 3222 0967)<br> Boutique hotel set in the heart of ancient Athens on Mitropoleos. It offers one of the best rooftop bar views of the Acropolis. Ask for one of its back rooms, on one of the higher floors, for an unspoilt view. Rooms are clean and conveniently sized. Double room \u00a395, single \u00a380.</p> <p><strong>Adrian</strong> (00 30 210 520 2491)<br> Set beneath the Acropolis at 74 Adrianou in Plaka, Athens's longest continuously inhabited district, this low-key family-run hotel has one of the best views of the 'holy hill'. Its terrace - used only for breakfast because of Plaka's licensing laws - offers great views of the Temple of Erechtheion. Front rooms look onto the pleasant but often noisy Agora square and are cheaper. Double room \u00a395, single \u00a375.</p> <p><strong>Electra Palace</strong> (00 30 210 337 0000)<br> An elegant hotel at 18 Nicodimou in Plaka which has been totally renovated. Its big claim to fame is the rooftop swimming pool with a full frontal view of the Acropolis. Double room \u00a3160, single \u00a3130.</p> <p><strong>Athenian Inn</strong> (00 30 210 723 8097)<br> This is in Kolonaki, Athens's choicest shopping district - look out for great shoes and clothes shops. Lawrence Durrell was particularly fond of the place. The address is 22 Haritos. Double room \u00a3120, single \u00a3100.</p> <p><strong>Fresh Hotel</strong> (0030 210 524 8511)<br> Athens's first 'design' hotel, Fresh opened last April at 26 Sophocleous Klisthenous, a side street in the teeming city centre not far from its food markets. Said to serve the finest breakfast in Greece. Double room \u00a3170, single \u00a3140.</p> <p>The five best restaurants:</p> <p><strong>Brachera </strong>(00 30 210 321 7202)<br> At Avissinias Square 3 in the centre of Athens's flea market, it has majestic view of the Acropolis rock and Temple of Hephaestus, probably the best-preserved Doric temple in Greece. Mediterranean cuisine with fine wines and great service. Affordably priced.</p> <p><strong>Greek House Attikos</strong> (00 30 210 921 6266) <br>For views, this restaurant at Filopappou 2 beats them all. The Parthenon and Atticus theatre never look better than from the vantage point of its roof which also faces the newly illuminated monument of Philopappou. Very reasonably priced with top starters - not least its chicken pie.</p> <p><strong>Mamacas</strong> (00 30 210 346 4984)<br> Fashionable Mykonian-style eaterie, found at Persefonis 41, Gazi, where chefs follow their mothers' recipes in often innovative styles. Customers choose from trays in the kitchen. Has a trendy bar next door.</p> <p><strong>Taverna tou Psara</strong> (Fishermens' Taverna) (00 30 210 321 8734)<br> Athens does best with fish tavernas and along with those to be found in Kaisariani, this, at Erecthiou 16, Anafiotika, is the one to head for. It is in Plaka and does excellent grilled seafood - all washed down with good local wine.</p> <p><strong>Taverna tou Psirri</strong> (00 30 210 321 4923)<br> One of the most authentic ouzeries in Athens, set at Aeschylou 12, Psirri, in what was once the red-light district. Dishes inspired from Naxos, the Cycladic island. Great ambience and good fish and cheese.</p>",
  "A faded piece of paper has been pinned to the noticeboard in the tiny office of Alec Jeffreys in Leicester University's genetics building for almost two decades. Covered in odd black splodges, the scrap looks utterly nondescript - only luck could have saved it from overzealous cleaners. Yet the document is of unprecedented scientific importance, for it is a copy of the world's first DNA fingerprint, a technology that has revolutionised society and is about to celebrate its 20th anniversary. <p>Thanks to DNA fingerprinting, it is now possible to identify criminals from a few cells left at a crime scene; pinpoint errant fathers in paternity cases; settle disputed immigration cases; and show within hours that a bearded, dishevelled man found hiding in an Iraqi bunker is indeed Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Once it was possible to lead a discreet, anonymous life, now our movements can be laid bare by forensic genetics: a power that has already affected millions of people, including criminals, suspects, policemen, immigrants, parents, offspring and lawyers. It has even become the subject of TV voyeurism, with teenage fathers being told on live TV whether or not they are the biological fathers of their partners' babies. </p> <p>And in future, as the technique's power is enhanced even further, samples will provide not just names but information about suspects' race, hair colour and facial features. 'Imagine DNA details about racial groups falling into the hands of some governments or organisations,' Jeffreys said last week. 'It is not a pleasant prospect.' </p> <p>The first 20 years of DNA fingerprinting may have been sensational, but the next 20 years are likely to be incendiary, although revolution was far from Jeffreys's mind on 10 September, 1984, when as a young geneticist - a grammar school boy whose father was a designer at the Rover car plant in Cowley, Oxford - he completed an experiment to find out if repeated sections of DNA could be used to track inherited diseases through families. He had collected blood samples from a lab technician, her parents, several monkeys and, for good measure, a grey seal. Then he ran his tests. </p> <p>At first glance, his results, still enshrined on his noticeboard, not only differentiated between individual humans and animals but also established kinship patterns. 'It was a blinding flash,' Jeffreys recalled. 'I had been working on disease genes. The last thing I was thinking about was paternity suits or forensics. But I would have had to have been a complete idiot not to spot the implications.' </p> <p>With Home Office help, Jeffreys began a collaboration aimed at perfecting his technology. Within a year DNA fingerprinting was being used in courts to establish the authenticity of immigrants seeking entry to the UK because they were offspring of British citizens but whose claims were not accepted by officials. </p> <p>Jeffreys convinced sceptical lawyers his technique was sound and could establish kinships, and the technology was seized on by immigrant communities. By 1991 more than 18,000 DNA fingerprint tests were carried out on people seeking UK entry and 95 per cent were shown to be telling the truth. They are now UK citizens - thanks to DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>But the technology's real headline grabber followed the rapes and murders in Narborough, Leicestershire, of schoolgirls Lynda Mann, in 1983, and Dawn Ashworth, in 1986. A local man, Richard Buckland, confessed to killing Dawn. 'Prove he murdered Lynda as well,' the police asked Jeffreys. So he took semen samples from the girls' bodies and blood from Buckland. </p> <p>His results caused consternation, for they showed Dawn and Linda had indeed been raped by the same man but that the attacker could not have been Buckland. The police were unimpressed. Your technique is a dud, they told Jeffreys. 'I thought: oh, shit, they must be right - there's something wrong with it. The man had confessed, after all.' But Home Office researchers backed him and the police eventually recanted. Buckland was acquitted - thanks to DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>But there was a further twist to the story. After this setback, police requested all local men give blood samples and asked Jeffreys to test each against the samples found on Lynda and Dawn. Four thousand men provided samples until another local man, Colin Pitchfork, was eventually caught trying to avoid taking the test, admitted his guilt (later confirmed by DNA fingerprinting), and was sentenced to life imprisonment. 'It was a perfect result,' said Jeffreys, 'a combination of technology and good old-fashioned coppering. We became partners.' </p> <p>Since then, DNA tests have helped solve thousands of crimes. Swabs taken in minor crimes have pinpointed murderers who have evaded capture for decades. In addition, Jeffreys has used the technique to identify the remains of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, while others have used it to pinpoint the bones of Tsar Nicholas II, murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918. </p> <p>Portable DNA laboratories made it possible to prove, in less than a day, US soldiers had definitely captured Saddam Hussein. Now military scientists are working on hand-held devices that could do the job in minutes, while the Home Office is investigating ways in which DNA profiles could be used, with other techniques, as the basis of identity cards. </p> <p>It is quite a portfolio, though Jeffreys, since knighted and made a fellow of the Royal Society, remains largely unaffected by the revolution he has set in motion. He still takes his breaks outside his genetics building, propped against a wall while he smokes the tiny Golden Virginia roll-ups he has puffed for the past 35 years. He still has the beard he grew in his youth - to cover the facial burns received when he blew up his old chemistry set. And his office, with its old wooden shelves and a couple of beat-up chairs, appears unchanged since I last interviewed Jeffreys ten years ago. </p> <p>Indeed, far from being overawed by his achievements, the father of genetic fingerprinting is now startlingly realistic. 'Today unscrupulous investigators can easily get your DNA profile - from saliva on a coffee cup or cigarette butt - and then use it to show whether you are the \"real\" parent of your child,' he said. 'It's illegal but simple to do, and I am very sure it occurs quite often. It is a gross invasion of a person's privacy.' </p> <p>More worrying for Jeffreys are the attempts - which he derides as 'hocus-pocus' - of scientists to improve DNA fingerprinting in a bid to get round problems affecting its current use. There are 2.5 million samples on Britain's national database, but only half the DNA they find at crime scenes matches one of these. So researchers are now trying to find ways of determining a culprit's race or hair colour or face from this unmatched DNA. 'If these scientists are successful they will provide police with the means of working out people's racial and medical histories just from the DNA they leave behind. That is just not on.' </p> <p>Such fears explain Jeffreys's promotion of the idea of a global DNA database. Put everyone's DNA fingerprint on it, but ban any data on race, health or physical appearance, and such civil liberties' abuses will be avoided - provided proper security controls are implemented. Just consider the Pitchfork murders. 'If we had had a global database at the time, we would have got him straight after the first crime. We would have saved a life. That is just one case. Now imagine that repeated thousands of times across the UK.' </p> <p>It remains to be seen if the issues raised by a global DNA database will allow it to become reality, though Jeffreys remains confident. 'I know David Blunkett has looked at the idea, but has done nothing yet, though I still think it is the answer to our current problems.' </p> <p>Jeffreys's invention has now touched more than 10 million lives, he estimates. It is a worldwide business and generates \u00a31 billion in annual revenues. Most royalties go to the Lister Institute, which employed Jeffreys in 1984, though a small sum has trickled through to the scientist. 'I used it to buy a cottage in Cornwall,' he said. 'And I shall be there this weekend. You see - crime does pay.' </p> <p><b>Cracking the code</b></p> <p><b>Alec Jeffreys's</b> invention exploits the fact that our genes contain random, apparently useless bits of DNA that are repeated in ways that are unique to an individual. </p> <p><b>DNA fingerprints</b> are made by breaking open cells and cutting up their DNA contents using special chemicals, called restriction enzymes, in order to isolate their sections of DNA repeats. The resulting fragments are then sorted out according to size. By labelling them with radioactive probes, the next step is to make mono images - producing a unique bar-code. It is then possible to establish kinship patterns as a mother and father will pass on their bar codes to offspring. </p> <p><b>There have been</b> several key modifications and developments to fingerprinting. With genetic amplification it is now possible to create millionfold copies of gene fragments, so that a handful of cells, too small to be seen by the naked eye, can provide sufficient material to make a DNA fingerprint.</p>",
  "<p>Cheapside's resident publican, Sidney, is revolting. He was pulled in to see a junior government minister, one Hazel Blears to discuss the national disgrace that is binge drinking. </p> <p>Along with fellow pint-pullers from the British Beer and Pub Association and the British Hospitality Association, Sid had his knuckles rapped. Tony is sick of the sight of bevvied-up youngsters fighting or falling over in town centres, and Blears has been deputised to discourage promotional activity. </p> <p>As if this were not bad enough, Sid says that the supermarkets were invited to the rebalancing session but did not turn up. Blears plans another special meeting for them. Why the no-show? we asked their representatives at the British Retail Consortium. 'Probably because they have made their case already,' explodes a spokesman. 'If the on-trade thinks it can wangle a restraint on our trade, then it can think again. Binge drinking is nothing to do with us. If you buy three bottles of wine in a pub, you'll drink them in one evening. If you buy them in a supermarket, you tend not to.' What about all those cheap beer deals, then? 'There are no votes in any government telling consumers it will stop supermarkets selling cheap lager.' Goodness. Check, mate. </p> <p><strong>Breadmaker</strong></p> <p>Jonathan Bloomer, head of Prudential, was not the most popular man in the City last week after he announced that the company was abandoning the sale of internet bank Egg. He'd coddled it, then scrambled, but finally decided it was going to turn out sunny side up, so to speak. Everyone was quick to point out the luckless Bloomer's previous howlers, but have they forgotten his triumphs? The biggest was collecting a break fee of over \u00a3600 million when the Pru was forced to abandon an agreed bid for American General in 2001 after the target received a higher bid from AIG. It was the biggest ever such fee paid to a British company - bloomin' clever, one might be forced to say. </p> <p><strong>Cold war</strong></p> <p>It has been a long time coming, but a neo-con nemesis has emerged in the United States to confront Unilever-owned hippy ice cream makers Ben &amp; Jerry's.

Nothing out of the ordinary there, of course. But our man behind the prawn sandwiches claims that professional relations broke down spectacularly at a recent 'shoot'.

  "<p>It was a while before I realised that other children didn't do what we did at the seaside. They went windsurfing or on donkey rides, or spent their pocket money at funfairs. But my family went looking for food: my snapshot memories of those summers are all hunter-gatherer scenes: my brother sliding down cliffs to snatch gulls' eggs, Dad wrestling with the ancient outboard as our tiny lobster-potting boat drifted further out to sea, my little sister busy on the beach stuffing a jelly-fish in her mouth. Well, she liked jelly. </p> <p>Tiree, the Hebridean island where my four brothers and sisters and I spent most of our summer holidays, is thus the only place where I know I'd never starve. I know how to eat everything you can gather on its rocky coast and bone-white beaches: razor shells, cockles, mussels, whelks, carrageen seaweed, winkles, crabs (velvet and red), conger eel, mackerel. This lore was passed on by my mother who had spent many of her childhood holidays on the same beaches, as had her mother before. </p> <p>We were proud of living off the island - I was Mowgli, living wild, except my jungle had no trees, just an expanse of wind, sky and water with a trace of low green land squeezed between them. Tiree doesn't look promising if you arrive on the ferry on a day when the rain clouds are crowding in from the west. But one of the island's many Gaelic names is 'Land of Plenty'. Another is 'Land Below the Waves'. </p> <p>Off the land there were mushrooms, snails in the dry-stone walls, watercress in the ditches, rock pigeon and hare - my brother had a lurcher dog called Jess. She would run down hares on the grassy dune-land and then sit looking innocent by the dead animal until we came and picked it up. The island's one butcher's shop sold - and still sells - the world's greatest cuts of lamb, sweet and tender from a life spent grazing the Hebridean clover. In season, you can buy the exquisite little new potatoes that the crofters grow in the island's sandy soil. There is a Co-op, for essentials - how we mocked the holidaymakers who we found buying fish fingers. Ridiculous, with all that food sitting out there. </p> <p>It must sound a bit like boot camp. It's true that we spent most of the daylight hours working for our stomachs - looking for food, working out ways of catching food, helping get the food ready. But it was adventure and luxury. My mother told us that we could eat the most expensive, delicious food in the world here - for free! Which would obviously make it taste better. This made an impression. 'Do you know how much French people pay for six snails? A month's pocket money!' my older sister and I would brag. We ate them for nothing, as many as we liked. The skittering velvet crabs, so numerous they were a pest in the lobster pots, were a delicacy in Spain. Sometimes planes would land on the island, buy a load from the fishermen, and fly them to Madrid. And lobsters: 'Millionaires eat lobsters!' But, my mother said, we ate better lobsters than millionaires - because ours were fresh from the Scottish sea. </p> <p>She was right. I can't to this day eat a lobster happily in a city restaurant - unless, perhaps, someone else is paying for it. Nowadays most are imported semi-frozen from the other side of the Atlantic. Rubbery, empty of flavour, they just don't taste anything like those royal blue monsters fresh from the lobster pots in the Sound of Gunna. Eating a lobster was childhood's best treat - an epic event. By the time we'd finished sucking the sweet watery contents from the antennae and all of the eight legs, the family had been at the table for two hours. One of my sisters gave a horrified account of her first restaurant lobster - bought by a boyfriend somewhere smart in London. 'It cost \u00a320 and that was just for the tail and claws. They didn't even give me the head! I asked for them to bring it back from the kitchen and they said they'd thrown it away.' </p> <p>In the sea around the island we would potter with Dad in a tiny boat on the days - often rare, even in summer - when the waves had no white caps and Mull's blue mountains showed clear, 15 miles away across the water. We'd fish for lobster-pot bait with feathered hooks and sometimes hit a shoal of mackerel, their sharp tugs on the handline thrilling compared to the duller pull of the tasteless saithe (coley) we caught for the pots. If you hit the mackerel, you could find yourself pulling up six on a line at a time - we would shout with excitement. Fresh mackerel are a feast - utterly different from the dull and flabby things in the supermarket. These were muscular daggers, petrol blue and dashed with iridescent rainbow, when we pulled them, fighting, into the boat. We'd fry them as soon as we got home in butter and oatmeal and eat them on toast. The flesh was so firm your teeth seemed to creak when you bit into it: my mouth waters thinking about them. </p> <p>Almost every outing - picnic, swimming trip or exploration - was a hunter-gathering adventure. On rainy days, we'd go to the ferry pier on Gott Bay. Here, while the younger children dangled worms on hooks to catch the tiny fish that swarmed around the piles, my oldest sister and I would climb down a rusty ladder to balance on a crossbeam just above the waves. There you could wrestle clusters of huge mussels off the girders, and then scramble back up, the heavy buckets slipping from our hands. </p> <p>Mussels were a hassle: the excitement of collecting them was followed by the long chore of chipping away the barnacles, your cold hands stinging with tiny cuts, until they were ready for my mother's sumptuous moules marini\u00e8res. (Later, my brother invented a brilliant system - steam them open, pull them from their shells, rinse and sieve - no need for the cleaning. But that way you don't get the fabulous pile of gleaming midnight-blue shells, stacked over the broth of wine and cream.) These mussels tasted like no others. They grew so big and juicy on the ferry pier, it was said, because nearby was the exit point of the little town of Scarinish's sewage pipe. So my mother would always have the first plate of mussels of the holidays: 'Just to test them - it's better if I die of food poisoning than if everyone does.' But we children always suspected this wasn't so much martyrdom as plain greed. </p> <p>Picnics for the seven of us were a major logistical operation. As every parent knows, a picnic takes 15 minutes' preparation per participant. That's only just enough time to round up the gear and the children, find fleeces and macs and wellingtons, and get everyone into the car. We had to pile all the food-finding gear in as well. Cockle rakes, shrimp nets, buckets. An old saucepan, some newspapers to light a driftwood fire, and a shelf from the oven to act as a grill. The only food really necessary was bread, butter, perhaps a container of salad. And, crucially, salt and a jar of Hellmann's mayonnaise. </p> <p>Our picnics also had to be timed by the tides. Ideally we'd get to the beach - not very hard, since it is difficult on Tiree to get out of sight of the sea - just as the water was approaching its lowest. This exposes the greatest playground on the planet - seaweed gardens, rock pools with whole societies of sea animals, swathes of sand to build castles in before the tide returns. And of course, the low tide exposes food. </p> <p>There's no shortage of this. Most Scottish rock pools are full of winkles, their round olive-green or brown shells as easy to pick as daisies on a lawn. Between the rocks we pushed our shrimping nets, scooping up tiny baby flounders and the translucent shrimps, sometimes as long as a child's finger. Boiled they went pink, with a fine grainy texture and salty taste quite unlike prawns - but not hugely interesting. So we melted butter and a little garlic and parsley and potted them. After a few hours in the fridge, you can spread them on toast. </p> <p>Just as the tide restarts its invasion of the beach is the best time to catch the cockles that lurk under the sand. If you were lucky you could feel their hardness in the wet sand with your bare toes and pounce on them before they burrowed deeper. If we found one, that meant there would be more: we would jump up and down across the sand - somebody once said that this brought the cockles to the surface, and though this was never truly proven, a mass jumping session became part of the ritual. Then we'd dig a trench across the likely area with a garden fork, the children diving into the holes to grab the ridged double-shells. We kept an eye open for strangers. The spots on the beaches where cockles lurk are rare and move mysteriously. So if a group of tourists wandered past we'd stop pogoing on the tide line and pretend to be digging sandcastles so that they would not learn the secret location of our cocklemine. They must have thought we were completely bonkers. </p> <p>Picking winkles is much easier: put to work, a team of toddlers can get half a bucket in a few minutes, and they cook just as quickly. At my ideal picnic, in a cove under Tiree's sole mildly impressive hill, Ceann a'Mhara, others have already gathered driftwood and lit the fire while the beach crew has gathered the shellfish. The bread is buttered. The saucepan has a couple of inches of seawater in the bottom of it, simmering, so we can pour the winkles straight from the bucket. (This bit can be painful - winkles are strangely charming and it is not easy boiling a mollusc your child has just given a name to.) But after a couple of minutes they are ready. There is no explaining to people who don't know them the peculiar pleasure of winkles - a subtle, bitter-nutty flavour and a fascinating rubber band texture. Last summer, with great ceremony, I prised one from a shell with a genuine winkle-picker - a safety pin - for my four-year-old son's induction to the Joy of Winkles. He looked at it and screamed, predictably, 'bogey!' Children don't know how lucky they are. </p> <p>I think they are much more interesting than snails. Eat them on bread or oatcakes - the only thing to drink with them is thick Scottish tea or malt whisky. So obviously addictive are winkles, when you get started, that my brother once planned a business freeze-drying them to sell next to the pork scratchings in pubs. </p> <p>The only British chefs that I know of who can find time for winkles are Rick Stein, who puts them in his Padstow fruits de mer, and of course Fergus and Margot Henderson, the proprietors of London's St John restaurant, prophets of the real-food movement. Fergus picked his first winkles on Tiree, too. </p> <p>We spent more time and more thought on lobster-potting than anything else. My parents had learnt the tricks of the trade from Donald Kennedy, who was the island's postmaster and a friend from my mother's childhood. It was according to his precise instructions that we laid our three pots. The bait was the coley we'd caught on those fishing expeditions, left to lie in a barrel for a day or two until it had started to stink - getting the bait from the barrel was my least favourite job. In our little boat we'd steer among the rocks until the perfect spot was found; not too shallow, not too deep, just on the edge of the sea-tangle. Then we'd drop the pot, pay out its rope, make sure it was set so the high tide wouldn't carry it out to sea. </p> <p>A day later we'd go to lift the pots. Leaning over the side of the boat, you'd watch intently as the shapes coalesced while the pot came up from the darkness. Was something there? Was it seaweed? A crab? Several crabs? Or, and as the pot surfaced, water dripping, there could be a furious blue shape, trimmed with gold, claws up ready to fight - a lobster! </p> <p>It was rare to see a pot come up with nothing. And everything could be eaten - even the giant whelks that sometimes swarm a pot disgustingly could be boiled for hours (and still keep the texture of car tyres). Conger eels, some as long as my father's leg, were hard to deal with but good to eat - we tried to smoke them by sticking them up the chimney and burning pine driftwood underneath. The crabs, in good years, were so numerous, you would throw back all but the bestlooking ones. </p> <p>Tiree is a harsh and beautiful place. Though the beaches are glorious, it's not Scotland as advertised: there are no beautiful lochs and Tiree boasts probably the least impressive ben in the whole of the country. But as a kindergarten for a foodie, there was nowhere else. </p> <p><strong>Snails with wine and garlic</strong> </p> <p>serves 6 </p> <p>approx 72 snails<br>1 bay leaf<br>1/2 bottle white wine<br>knob of butter<br>ground pepper<br>1 clove garlic crushed<br>1 tsp cayenne pepper </p> <p>Clean snails until the water runs clear, put them in a saucepan and cover with cold water.

Don't worry though - the rustic charm of the place is not about to be swept aside. Alfresco lunches may well be extended to dinners, the evenings warmed by heaters and your own wine supplemented by a short in-house list. Otherwise it's plain home cooking as usual with locally sourced fish. </p> <p><strong>The Company Shed</strong><br>129 Coast Road, West Mersea, Essex<br>(01206 382700) </p> <p>About twice a month the coast road floods and the tide comes up to the door of this wooden shed, which doubles as fishmonger and impromptu lunch venue looking out over the fishing boats and pleasure cruisers. You can't book and it's always full - perhaps because a typical platter of whole crab, smoked salmon, smoked mackerel, cockles, prawns and mussels costs just \u00a38.You bring the wine and the bread and butter.

  "<p>It's great working with models. Well, in some ways it's great. For one thing, they know how to take a good picture, which means they get on with the job and pose with the minimum of fuss. For another, they are pretty handy when it comes to flagging down a taxi. Usually, I'm a loser when it comes to taxis, especially in New York. Once, on a day so cold I was wearing a pair of cashmere socks on top of my leather gloves, I stood on a frozen SoHo corner for 17 minutes before one deigned to pull over. But with a model in tow, it's a different story. Models are to cabs what carrion is to hungry crows. You just stick them at the edge of the sidewalk, hide behind the nearest trash can and wait. Your ride will be with you momentarily. </p> <p>The downside, of course, is that you feel like an ugly dwarf. I meet Padma Lakshmi - model, actress, cookery writer and wife of the incredibly famous novelist Salman Rushdie - in Kalustyan's, an Indian deli on Lexington Avenue. It's a poky sort of place, all sacks of spice and sticky jars of pickles, but she adores it, and has done ever since she arrived in Manhattan in the early Seventies. I can see why. It's the perfect backdrop. Caught in its niggardly aisles, she dazzles like a chandelier in a public lavatory. Lord, she is beautiful - so lovely, in fact, that I spend the first few moments of our encounter in a kind of reverential stupor. When, with only a gracious smile, she hands me her Gucci bag and her goggly Costume Nationale sunglasses so she can strut her stuff for the photographer, do I feel the slightest bit put out? No. I just stand there, by the palm hearts, like some bloody coatstand. </p> <p>Apparently, Lakshmi does a lot of her shopping here in Kalustyan's - or, to be more accurate, her 'housekeeper' regularly swings by on her behalf. She and Rushdie, whom she married last April, are both watching their waistlines right now so, most evenings, it is fish for supper. 'I'm getting into making pickles ,' she says, super-animated (when the tape recorder is switched on, she swoops straight into voice-over mode; as soon as it is off, she immediately flicks out the light, and you are left feeling all chilly and resentful). 'Take six lemons, cover with salt, and put them in a dark place for six months. Classic south Indian pickles. Then I have my housekeeper go and get a nice fee-lay of fish, and I marinate it with the pickles.' She serves her fillet of fish with wilted spinach, but without carbohydrates. Apparently, this is because she suffers from a common but nevertheless troubling condition known as 'my little rice belly'. </p> <p>Not that she is a starver. She doesn't do diets. 'They don't work with me,' she says. 'I feel so deprived, like the stepchild at the table who can't have the roast.' Lakshmi's mysterious ability to stay slim while feasting like a queen is how she got into cookery writing in the first place. 'I had to lose 20 pounds that I'd gained for a Cuban movie. So I started cooking all my normal recipes but instead of butter, I'd use olive oil, and instead of cream I'd use yoghurt.' One night, she fed some actors. Later, these same actors happened to tell Harvey Weinstein, boss of the Miramax film and publishing empire, all about this 'really skinny model who cooks'. Not long after, she went to a premiere where she got talking to Harvey and his wife Eve. Everyone, she told them, wants to know what a model eats. Eve was intrigued and, faster than you can say coconut chicken, Miramax published her first book, Easy Exotic, a collection of low-fat recipes from around the world also featuring lots of soft-focus photographs of its author in what looked like her nightie. A weekly slot on the Food Network - Padma's Passport - soon followed. In one show, wearing a revealing silk dress, she whipped up a batch of kheer - a pudding made with rice - while explaining how each of its ingredients have a deeper meaning (milk represents our connection to our mothers, while sugar reminds us of the sweetness of life). </p> <p>Easy Exotic won the 1999 Versailles World Cookbook Fair Award for Best First Book, and it sold well, too (our photographer, for one, tells Lakshmi that he is just bananas about her recipe for rajma, a vegetarian chilli dish from north India). The book is a real hotch-potch: recipes from Morocco, Spain and Italy jostle with bite-sized accounts of the author's Indian childhood or the way a bowl of cream of carrot soup consumed in a Parisian brasserie cheered her up after a longed-for shoot for French Glamour had been cancelled. 'From the simple stringing together of lemon garlands for the goddess Durga, to dividing the prasadam or blessed foods for the children first, I came to associate food not only with feminity, but also with purity and divinity,' she writes. 'Unlike most Westerners, I have also gone from a vegetarian (I was brought up in the strictest of Brahmin households) to eating meat.' But, as one American critic noted, in essence, it makes you think two things. One, the spaghetti sauce on page 37 really does sound easy and delicious. I mean, how difficult can it be to mix a few tinned tomatoes with some oregano and garlic? And two, no one looks like that while making spaghetti. </p> <p>Lakshmi is now close to finishing her second book, which is why she has agreed to meet me, and to take me to her favourite foodie haunts (alas, she is unable to cook for me; journalists are not allowed in the Lakshmi-Rushdie home, nor even to know its precise location). 'This book's going to be much bigger. I want it to be a book for the way people eat today. I don't have four hours to spend in the kitchen. Most people don't. Most people maybe have a housekeeper that cleans up after them. There's a great pleasure in having slow-cooked food. But actually to stand there watching it ...' She would also like to do more TV. 'When I was growing up in the US, there was a show called The Frugal Gourmet. Unfortunately, he got pulled up on some paedophile charges. But leaving that aside, he was good. He would give you all the history. I'd like to do a show like that. Not just: this is how you butterfly a chicken. But how ginger can help with nausea and how turmeric, when inhaled, is good for asthmatics.' </p> <p>After Kalustyan's, we head for Chinatown, in search of fish (she thinks nothing of swinging a great big bass near her flowery summer frock, but she is a little concerned that her heels - as high as the Empire State itself - will get all fishy). Then, by way of a treat, we go to an Upper East Side pizza joint, Serafina. The owner is a friend. </p> <p>'I was starting to feel a little naw-shus , I was so hungry,' she says, commandeering the menu. Whereupon she orders enough pizza to feed the cast of The Sopranos. There is pizza with cheese, pizza with tuna and, most luxe of all, pizza with white truffle. How much of all this did Ms Lakshmi scoff? Quite a lot, actually. The model approach to pizza is best described as rodent-like. She nibbles, hungrily, at the tasty centre of the wheel, before casting the crusts aside. They pile up like corn husks at the edge of a dusty field. </p> <p>Padma Lakshmi was born in Madras. She came to America when she was just four years old after her parents divorced. Thereafter, she spent most of the year in New York, with her mother, a nurse, and her holidays with her grandparents back in south India (she speaks both Tamil and Hindi). 'My first taste memory is pickle,' she says. 'Even as a kid, I was really weird. I liked chillis. I used to climb up the shelves in my grandmother's pantry. The pickle jar was kept right at the top. One time, I dropped the jar and it broke. I was totally busted. At school, we used to have tamarind trees. I was so tall, the boys hoisted me up to get them. Hot and sour. Those are the tastes I like.' But, once in New York, she felt different from everyone else - not least because her unsuspecting mother would send her to school with a Tupperware box full of vegetable curry. 'Everyone used to say: \"Eeeew! What's that?\" They all had these little peanut butter and jam sandwiches.' </p> <p>After high school, she went off to an 'expensive, liberal arts school', Clark University in Massachusetts. She was in Spain, studying for her honours thesis, when she was discovered as a model. 'In the most cliche way. I was in a cafe. I was too haughty for my own good. I said: \"I'm here to do my honours thesis\", and they were, like, yeah, but you can make $5,000 a day.' She giggles, excitedly. 'It wasn't the most stimulating thing in the world, but when you work with photographers like Ellen Von Unwerth and Helmut Newton, it's exciting, you know?' So did she make lots of money? 'Oh, I made plenty of money. I paid off my mother's mortgage, and my college loan. I was good with money. I set fire to a whole bunch of it, but I saved some, too.' Her debts paid off and her academic work complete, she then went back to Los Angeles, where her mother was now living. </p> <p>Her plan was to teach drama in high school. Then an agent from Italy came scouting. She followed him back to Milan with just $2,000 - a loan from her mother - and two suitcases to her name. 'It was liberating. A chance to be whatever I wanted to be. A clean slate. Plus I already knew the cachet that modelling gave - people coming backstage and wanting to have their picture taken with me. I was very seduced by that, I'll admit. At Clark, there were kids who drove to class in convertible BMWs, while I was eating spaghetti with onions and parmesan to pay for books. So the modelling was a way for me to level the playing field.' During this period, she worked for several big designers - Cavalli, Ungaro, Ralph Lauren, Isaac Mizrahi - and, because she was the only Asian model on the circuit, her profile steadily rose. Also, she could speak Italian. 'So it was easy for people to interview me.' Finally, to her amazement, she was offered a job co-presenting a Letterman-style TV show, Domenica In. </p> <p>She did half a season before she landed the role in the Cuban movie - the one for which she was required to pile on the pounds. 'I have a degree in theatre,' she says. 'I always said that if I saw a chance to do what I was educated to do, I would grab that opportunity.' And she still hopes to make it as an actress - in spite of the various setbacks she has had so far (her role in Glitter, a truly dreadful Mariah Carey vehicle, was mostly cut, and Boom, a Bollywood thriller about three supermodels who steal diamonds belonging to Indian mafiosi, was panned). 'It's pretty brutal,' she says, of the audition circuit. 'At least with modelling, you can go home and console yourself it's not personal - they were looking for a blonde. But with acting, you think: \"What am I doing wrong?\" I have a degree. I work out with a coach.' She sighs. She thinks the colour of her skin may be against her. </p> <p>Does she ever worry that people assume she is, well, a bimbo? 'People's own arrogance prevents them from seeing you how you really are. So it's more to do with them than with you. I get bored with people who don't see me for who I am. People are always surprised when I get business-like. I was working with a screenwriter on a book I had optioned, and I gave him notes. Afterwards, he said: \"I don't like you when you're like that. I like you when you're giggling and having a beer.\" Well, too bad, I said. You are being paid by me. People are thrown off by someone who looks feminine, but is also strong. It's not that pretty girls aren't smart, it's that women aren't strong.' All of which sounds thoroughly convincing until she somewhat undermines her own argument by adding: \"But I'd be lying to you if I said that my new last name didn't resolve the issue of whether I am intelligent or not. I think that people assume that if someone of that calibre ...' </p> <p>Lakshmi met Salman Rushdie, the man who brought her to our attention, five years ago, at the party to launch Tina Brown's ill-fated magazine, Talk. 'I think Tina actually introduced us,' she says. 'But there were a lot of interesting people there - Madonna, Demi Moore - I was a very small fish in a huge ocean.' She was thrilled to meet him. 'In India, he is very, very famous. He's like Faulkner to Americans, or Dostoevsky to Russians.' Didn't she find this intimidating? ' No! He was so far removed from my universe. It didn't occur to me to make comparisons between our lives or accomplishments. I didn't care! That would be like comparing myself to Clinton. What would be the point? Would you compare yourself to Louis Armstrong?' Did she fancy him? \"I would never have said that I'd be able to fancy him, but he's very charismatic, he's got a great sense of humour, he's endearing, he's a real charmer, he's a good flirter, and he loves women.' The only thing she doesn't like about him is his beard. It plays havoc with her skin. </p> <p>Their early relationship was conducted entirely by telephone and that, she says, is when she fell in love. 'He was in London, and I was travelling a lot on this little book tour of mine. I was in these hotel rooms by myself so we would talk a lot.' Was she aware that he was pursuing her? 'I don't think he was! We never acknowledged the situation. But our defences were down, and so were our preconceived notions of what the other was like.' But she was literally Rushdie's ideal woman, having appeared as such in books he had written even before they met (the model Lauren Hutton once approached her and, having read The Ground Beneath Her Feet, said: 'You must be Vina,' a reference to the novel's heroine). It was almost as if he had conjured her up - and, a few months later, having separated from his third wife, Elizabeth West, Rushdie moved to New York to be with her. He modelled the heroine of Fury, his last novel, on Lakshmi, right down to the scar on her arm, the result of a serious car accident she had as a child. </p> <p>'We're connected by our personal struggles,' she says. 'Neither of us is completely Western, or completely Eastern. We've created our home with each other.' But their relationship has always been the subject of copious gossip column inches: it's on; it's off; he doesn't think she's intellectual enough for him. 'Yeah. Thankfully, I don't see a lot of it. I was, and still am, trying to build this film career. Plus, I'm an American. I have no reason to be in London. He has children in England, and he is a very active dad. So we were seen apart a lot, and without each other, we were lonely, so we went out with our friends. He'd call Nigella, or Marie Helvin. But now we're married, you'll see us arriving at a premiere. He loves to go out. I like to be home in my jammies, eating popcorn. But he spends all day locked in a room. In the evening, he wants civilisation. He's very culturally oriented.' </p> <p>Their wedding, which took place in a Manhattan loft, was a largely Hindi affair. The groom, 56, wore a long, black sherwani (a Mughal-style frock coat) and a silver grey dupatta (scarf). The bride, 30, wore a purple sari. Guests included Steve Martin and Lou Reed. But the best bit, she says, was the food, which was catered by the Bukhara Grill, a chi-chi New York eaterie. Padma provided her own recipes for raw mango curry and meen moilee (fish in coconut milk) and there was also bhelpuri, haryali chicken, paneer poper and black pepper cashews, followed by Gujarati dal, gobi, shrimp in mango sauce, sharabi kebabi, rice and paratha. Pudding was rose- flavoured chum chum sweetmeats, lachedar rabri, a milk sweet, and tila kulfi - Indian ice cream on a stick, delivered by cart. Guests took home goody bags which contained Mac cosmetics, Padma's spice mix and her recipe for meen moilee. </p> <p>Food, Lakshmi believes, is the 'main socialisation of our times' - by which she means, I think, that it brings people together. But is it also the way to a man's heart? (Not that she must require much help in that department.) 'Oh, yes ,' she says. 'Get some green seedless grapes, take them off the stems and freeze them. They become like hard, little marbles. They're great to feed your lover in bed. You can imagine the rest. But use the green ones, not the red ones because the red ones stain the sheet. Just keep them in the fridge - you never know when a date is going to end up back at your place.' It is tempting, at this juncture, to ask if this is a technique she has used on her esteemed husband ('He's a walking encyclopaedia; it's kind of annoying'). But unfortunately, Padma has clocked her watch. 'It's four o'clock!' she wails. Click! Out goes the light, on go the sunglasses, and off she trots. The waiters, previously an attentive swarm, now disappear into the shadows. Poor things. All they have to remember her by is a heap of dry pizza crusts. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>To order Easy Exotic: Low-fat Recipes from Around the World by Padma Lakshmi (Hyperion) for \u00a38.99 call the Observer Book Service on 0870836 0885</p> <p><strong> Padma's low-fat chicken recipes </strong></p> <p><strong>Coconut chicken </strong><br> <strong>serves 4 </strong></p> <p> Prep time 15 to 20 mins; cook time 30 mins </p> <p>1 onion, coarsely chopped <br>3 cloves garlic, chopped <br>1 tbs minced fresh ginger root <br>1 large jalapeno chilli, stemmed and halved <br>grated zest of 1 lemon, about 1 tbs <br>cup water <br>2 tbs sesame oil <br>one 1.5kg pound chicken, cut into small serving pieces, skin removed <br>1 cup sliced carrots <br>salt <br>2 tsp hot Madras curry powder <br>1 400g can unsweetened 'light' coconut milk <br>fresh lemon juice to taste <br>0.5 - 1 cup loosely packed chopped fresh coriander leaves </p> <p> In a blender combine the onion, garlic, ginger root, chilli, lemon zest and water and blend until pureed. </p> <p>In a casserole set over moderate heat, warm the oil until it is hot.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 15 2004</strong></p> <p> Readers tempted to follow advice given in the article below to move their washing machine from kitchen to bathroom should contact the manufacturer to ensure that the appliance is suitable for bathroom installation. The electricity supply must be protected by a residual operating current. Contact the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) for further advice or visit <a href=\"http://www.eca.co.uk\">Eca.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>  </p> <p>On the day of Jenny Morris's visit, our kitchen is inexplicably filled with flies. I say inexplicably, but as Jenny - the doyenne of food safety and hygiene - is about to tell me, no unwelcome visitor to the domestic kitchen is there without an invitation from a slapdash cook. It's the hottest day of the year and the back door and windows are wide open. Something must be luring the flies in. 'That bin is the problem,' Jenny observes in her matronly, Margaret Thatcher way, inspecting the US-style trash can (Jerry's Home Store, circa 1995) with its letterbox lid hanging limply open and a disposable nappy clearly poking out the top. 'It's not just that the spring is broken, but you have to touch it every time you throw anything away. Your hands pick up bacteria and transfer them to food, which is why you should wash them regularly. A pedal bin is better, even if it's less fashionable.' </p> <p>I can see where things are heading. Here I am, confidently inviting an environmental health officer (EHO) to watch me cook, secure in the belief that our kitchen is pristine and my culinary habits impeccable - and already I have failed. 'What shall I do about the flies?' I ask flatly, expecting Jenny to recommend Vapona fly-paper strips or a repellent device - but her solution is low-tech. 'Give all kitchen surfaces a good wash down before you start,' she says, 'using hot soapy water. That should be done every time, regardless of the weather. After that, don't leave out any food on which flies are likely to settle; if you do, cover it.' </p> <p>It's a sobering thought, that no meal should be prepared without scrubbing up like a surgeon and scrubbing down like a deckhand - but that is the reality of cooking in a British summer. July and August are peak months for cases of infectious intestinal disease (IID), characterised by diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and passed from person to person. The condition accounts for 10.5 million cases a year and costs the country \u00a3750 million in healthcare bills and lost working days. Of these cases, perhaps 2.4 million are directly caused by food poisoning and, in particular, fly-borne bacteria. Feeding alternately on filth (notably faeces) and sweet foods (such as sugar and milk), houseflies regurgitate their first meal on their second, trample it to a slurry with their feet and siphon it up, leaving behind bacteria trapped among their leg hairs. 'You never know where flies have been,' says Jenny, 'so you don't want to take any risks.' </p> <p>Nor is it just insects that are at their most active in the warmer months. Thanks to inept barbecuing (which leaves bacteria alive in undercooked meat), mass outdoor catering (which spreads infection), poor personal hygiene, defective refrigerators and rapidly deteriorating food, the bacteria associated with poor animal husbandry also have a field day. Farm animals harbour organisms in their gut which are spread to the outside of meat at the time of slaughter; eggs and milk can also be tainted by the disease and fecundity of the farmyard. In August, cases of salmonellosis (caused by the salmonella bacterium) increase fourfold compared with January, while campylobacteriosis (from the campylobacter bug associated with poultry) doubles. Though both organisms can be killed by thorough cooking at high temperatures, they can be transferred to foods such as salad which will not be cooked - typically when the juices from raw meat and poultry drip onto the shelf below in the fridge. This is cross-contamination. </p> <p>So significant is the problem that the Food Standards Agency has set itself the target of achieving a 20 per cent reduction in food-poisoning cases by 2006, focusing its campaign on five micro-organisms that are rampant during the summer months: salmonella, campylobacter and clostridium perfringens (responsible for the largest number of cases) and listeria and E.coli 0157 (which causes more severe illness in fewer people). In June, the Food and Drink Federation - assisted by the FSA and others - ran a National Food Safety Week highlighting how bacteria are spread. 'Are You A Chicken Splasher?' its campaign literature asked, referring to a finding that 81 per cent of Britons rinse poultry under the kitchen tap before cooking it, splattering bacteria over sink, work surfaces, utensils and themselves. </p> <p>'That is classic cross-contamination,' Jenny Morris explains, 'which is one of the Food Standard Agency's four Cs [used in its campaign as an aide-memoir for avoiding food poisoning]. The other three are cleaning, cooking and chilling.' It is against these criteria that my performance will be judged by Jenny (who, as well as being an EHO, is policy officer for the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health). To make things worse, I have chosen ingredients and methods notorious for their food-poisoning potential: frozen scallops, king prawns, fresh raw tuna and cod, sliced, marinated in lemon juice and threaded on skewers with red and yellow peppers and courgettes. These kebabs will be lightly grilled (to simulate barbecuing) and served with new potatoes and a salad of organic red batavia lettuce, Little Gem leaves, wild rocket and vine tomatoes. My pact with Jenny is that I will behave as I do when preparing a family meal; I must not sanitise my technique on account of her presence. Armed with a probe thermometer and a critical demeanour, she will judge my food safety and my personal hygiene. </p> <p>First, there is the bacteriological can of worms that is our fridge - an ancient, leaking Hotpoint bought for \u00a320 from the previous owner of the house. 'I'll just leave the thermometer in here for a while,' says Jenny, as I pick up an abrasive sponge - our only abrasive sponge - and begin scrubbing the new potatoes. Wiping down the board I chopped them on, I take my medley of fish and seafood from the fridge, where the scallops have been defrosting overnight. I can see Jenny taking notes. A quick slash with the knife, a squeeze of lemon juice, some salt and pepper, and the fish and vegetables are ready for assembly on skewers. Brushing the kebabs with olive oil, I stick them under the grill and start preparing the salad. Jenny takes her thermometer from the fridge, looks at it through narrowed eyes, then sticks its probe into a can of tuna covered in Clingfilm, leftover from the night before. She closes the door and retrieves the thermometer later. </p> <p>Oddly, like the unprecedented flies, the grill undermines my confidence on the very day I am being held up to scrutiny. Our gleaming Smeg cooker which we cherish like a baby (even using Johnson's baby oil to maintain its mirror-like sheen) takes nearly half an hour to grill one side of the kebabs. There is plenty of time to chat. I discover that Jenny has been both a chef and a caterer before becoming an EHO - so my meal will be judged for its culinary merits as well as micro-biologically. </p> <p>'It's all very tasty,' she says politely at my hour of reckoning, when we eventually sit down to a plateful of pale, fashionably underdone kebabs and a fly-blown salad. 'I haven't seen anything so bad it makes me not want to eat it.' Without warning, she whips out her thermometer and thrusts it deep into a scallop, retrieving the device after two minutes. Is it my imagination, or does she look worried? 'It's 59 ,' she announces, 'but to kill all the bacteria you need to achieve 70 at the centre for two minutes. Wouldn't it be good for your story if we both went down with food poisoning?' I laugh nervously. </p> <p> <strong> How the bacteria stacked up </strong></p> <p><strong> Chopping boards </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> mine is expensive and constructed from a single piece of wood. 'Those made from several pieces are glued together,' says Jenny, 'and if the glue starts to give, you have lots of gaps for food-trapping and bacteria.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> although there are two boards in the house, I am too lazy to use the second. The same one is used for raw fish and seafood as for chopping vegetables and salad, albeit with a good wash down in between. Theoretically, I turn it over when I switch from raw fish to vegetables - but I can't recall which side I'm on. It's a perfect recipe for contamination. </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> 'In a domestic kitchen, it's a very good idea to have more than one board,' says Jenny, 'ideally in different shapes or colours, so you can differentiate. Anything \"dirty\" - raw meat and fish - would be prepared on one, and all the \"clean\" stuff - salads and sandwiches - on the other.' </p> <p>Commercial food businesses use heavy-duty plastic or polypropylene boards, which are the most hygienic, and Jenny recommends them. 'If you have only one board,' she advises, 'spray it after use with a sanitiser, an antibacterial spray such as Dettox, then wipe it dry with a piece of kitchen towel. Because the risk of cross-contamination is so high, I might not rely on hot soapy water.' </p> <p> <strong> Cloths and sponges </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> there really isn't one. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> 'It's one of your big failings,' says Jenny, witheringly. 'You have a major cross-contamination issue with your cloths.' To begin with, I used the same abrasive sponge to scrub muddy potatoes as I did to wipe down the board on which I prepared salad - spreading farm bacteria everywhere. Then, after chopping raw fish and seafood, I used the same sponge again to swab down kitchen surfaces. 'Even though you rinsed it out,' says Jenny, 'it has potential bacteria traps because it is abrasive.' </p> <p>That was certainly the finding of a University of Westminster study examining the fingertips of subjects after using different types of cloth: for a sponge, the count was 65.8 colonies of bacteria on the fingers compared with 39.7 for a dishcloth and zero for a paper towel. Some 83 per cent of sponges examined showed a 'high' rate of contamination after one day's use (with more than a billion bacteria present, rising to 10 billion after several days). As the study's stomach-churning summary pointed out, the source of bacteria 'varied from water to the human gut, respiratory tract and skin' and included E. coli, salmonella and the distinctly unappetising enterococcus faecalis. </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> use different cloths or sponges for different tasks - 'That's my clean cloth, the yellow one; that's my dirty cloth, the blue one,' suggests Jenny. Failing that, boil, bleach or disinfect cloths regularly (ideally every day) or throw them away. Non-woven dish cloths are better than sponges because they have fewer 'traps' where germs can hide, and hold less water, which helps bacteria thrive. </p> <p> <strong> The freezer </strong></p> <p> <strong>Upside: </strong> everything in it is still frozen! The scallops were defrosted in the fridge, not the open air - 'the correct way to do it', says Jenny. 'A lot of research has been done on defrosting,' she explains, 'and the recommendation is to do it in the fridge, where there are controlled conditions.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> I didn't check whether the scallops were thawed right through before using them. 'If that product is not defrosted at the core,' says Jenny, 'the little nugget of ice in the middle will cool the scallop down and stop it cooking properly.' The result: serious food poisoning. I also splashed water from the scallop bag on to the kitchen surface - a cross-contamination issue - and put the unsealed bag back in the fridge next to a tub of hummus. 'Those juices can contaminate other things,' Jenny warns. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> press defrosted food with your fingers to check it is thawed, or even run a skewer through it. Be careful with defrosted juices, which carry bacteria. </p> <p> <strong> The fridge </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside: </strong> to my amazement, Jenny gives this a clean bill of health. 'You've got reasonable separation,' she says, 'with your salad on the top and your meat below to avoid cross-contamination. Everything was covered properly and it gives the general impression of being clean.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> a fridge should operate at 1 C to 4 C to stop bacteria multiplying - but this one registered 9 C on Jenny's probe thermometer (after the door was opened briefly). A better indication was the tinned tuna, with a core temperature of 6.7 C. 'You are just within the legal limit for commercial premises, which is 8 C,' says Jenny, 'but the general safety recommendation is 5 C and below.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> buy a new fridge - or at the very least, a fridge thermometer. Turn up the temperature control in summer. </p> <p> <strong> The grill </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> it certainly looks attractive. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> it doesn't work. Maybe I omitted to turn it on fully, but it took an eternity to cook the kebabs. 'The danger with that,' Jenny points out, 'is that if something has been under the grill a long time, people assume it is cooked and don't check.' She checked, and found the core temperature of the fish was 58 C or 59 C. 'To make sure you have killed all the bacteria,' she warns, 'you need to achieve 70 C at the centre for a minimum of two minutes. The cooking temperature depends on the food product - and if that was a piece of chicken [notorious for bacteria], pork [known to contain parasites] or a burger [where the mincing process transfers surface bacteria to the core of the patty], you would have a potential problem.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> if the grilling is suspect, as with a barbecue, it's essential to cook very thoroughly. No fashionable pinkness, says Jenny, and no 'piercing with a skewer until the juices run clear'. That method, she found as a caterer, is far too subjective and it's better to cut through to the centre of the meat with a knife to check. Chicken, she argues, should never be served at a barbecue. 'Don't do it,' she says, 'because you can't cook it properly on account of its size. If you must, cook it in the oven and finish it over charcoal.' </p> <p> <strong> The hands </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> there is a bottle of antibacterial hand-wash by the kitchen sink. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> I never use it. 'I'm sorry,' observes Jenny, 'but you really don't wash your hands very often. You should definitely wash them before you begin and after handling raw fish or meat - but you didn't.' From fingertip to elbow, the average person has between two million and 10 million bacteria, according to Martin Paterson, deputy director general of the Food and Drink Federation. 'If you wear a ring,' he adds, 'there could be as many germs under it - 700 million - as there are people in Europe.' No wonder Jenny recoiled when I failed to wash my hands after assembling the (raw) fish kebabs. 'You went to find your oil brush,' she says, 'and you rooted through the kitchen drawer, touching many things. The handles of your utensils are now contaminated, the drawer handles are contaminated. Then you picked up your oil bottle, so the next person who touches it will pick up that contamination. They may be handling a salad next.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> wash hands regularly and do it properly. Most people neglect to clean around the thumbs, between the fingers, and around and under the nails, and the hands should be vigorously rubbed together for 15 seconds. Wet them before applying soap and dry them on kitchen towel: 1,000 times as many germs are spread from damp hands as from dry. </p> <p> <strong> The kitchen </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> 'It looks clean,' Jenny pronounces. 'Nothing made me gasp in horror.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> the designer swing bin, with its lid flapping open and all kinds of fly fodder (including the baby's soiled nappies) inside. Less obvious is the washing machine, sited under food-preparation surfaces. 'Wherever there is moisture there is contamination spread by the aerosol [droplet] method.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> 'Definitely get a new bin,' says Jenny. 'Whenever you prepare food, wash down all surfaces with hot soapy water as a precaution; you don't know whether flies have landed there or not. Thereafter, cover all food immediately. And re-plumb the washing machine in the bathroom.' </p> <p><strong> Knives </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside:</strong> we have a whole range to choose from in our Global knife-block, including - wait for it - a tomato knife. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> the smallest, sharpest vegetable blade is the only one we ever use (except for cutting bread and carving meat) - for fish, seafood and vegetables. 'The biggest issue around that,' says Jenny, 'was the lemon used in the marinade. You sliced it with the knife used for the raw fish and put the remainder straight back in the fridge. That lemon now has raw fish on the edges - so if you use it in, say, a drink, there will be contamination. If it's a gin and tonic, the alcohol might kill the bacteria; if it's a soft drink, it won't.' The result? A bacteria cocktail. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> ideally, use different knives for different foods. Failing that, wash the knife thoroughly when going from meat or fish to food you will eat uncooked. 'I'd probably use the sanitiser spray again,' says Jenny. </p> <p><strong> Leftovers </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> 'This was fine,' says Jenny. (I'm usually such a pig, there are none.) </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> 'You need to think carefully about what you are going to do with this food afterwards.' It is very important to cool food down before it goes back in the fridge; the maximum recommended time is 90 minutes, after which it will attract flies and be at a perfect temperature for bacteria to multiply. Quick cooling is an art. 'If it's a great big container of stew left over, split it up into smaller bowls,' says Jenny. 'Instead of cooking a single large joint, have a couple of smaller ones or cut it to aid cooling.' One major problem is rice. 'There is a bacterium associated with it, bacillus cereus,' she explains, 'which has a nasty habit of producing spores when conditions are adverse. It is very resistant to heat.' When cooked rice is left in less than ideal conditions for four or five hours or overnight, spores are released and the bacteria multiply dangerously. Though associated with takeaway restaurants, bacillus cereus might be a problem when making rice salad - leaving cooked rice in the open air and making the salad later. People will eat that live bacteria. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> 'The best way with rice is to cook it and eat it quickly,' says Jenny. 'If you want to re-use it, cool it very quickly and refrigerate it.' Some people do reheat rice successfully - that's what fried rice is - but it's safer to throw it away. </p> <p><strong> Tea towels </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> see cloths.</p> <p><strong> Downside: </strong> a cross-contamination disaster area. Tea towels hold a special place in the pantheon of food-poisoning risks, being damp, laden with bacteria from hands and decomposing food and typically kept on a warm radiator where bacteria thrive. 'A few years ago,' says Martin Paterson, 'we [the Food and Drink Federation] were highlighting tea towels because they are a major carrier of germs. People would go for six months without washing them; they'd just leave them sitting around on work surfaces. They are a huge source of contamination.' Jenny Morris also had a few things to say: 'I've noticed that you dry your hands on the tea towels,' she says. 'Again, you are transferring contamination on to those tea towels, and then you are using them to wipe down the chopping board you've just cleaned. You have possibly re-contaminated the board and the tea towels.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> 'You should never dry your hands on a tea towel,' Jenny insists. 'Kitchen roll is quite good. Don't use a tea towel on your chopping board; wash it, drain it and wipe the surface with a paper kitchen towel, which is for a single use.' Martin Paterson adds: 'Even for washing up, it's best to leave the dishes to drain, then use disposable cloths or paper towels.' Chuck your tea towels out. </p> <p><strong> Washing up </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> I scored full marks - almost. After washing the dishes in warm, soapy water, I rinsed them in hot water (described by Jenny as 'best practice') and left them on the surface to drain. My wife would never allow this; she says I'm lazy. </p> <p><strong> Downside: </strong> though this is the best method when washing up by hand (because it avoids wiping, tea towels and contamination), it is far better to use a dishwasher. 'They typically operate in excess of 80 C,' says Jenny, 'because at about 82 C, water starts to act as a disinfectant. The heat is killing bacteria, which you can't achieve with a hand wash - even wearing rubber gloves. All the warm water is doing is loosening the dirt and grease from the plate. With rubbing and the penetration of the soap, this might get some of the bacteria off but it certainly won't kill them. What's more, if you don't change the water often enough, very soon it won't be hot soapy water; it will be a bacterial soup.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> buy a dishwasher.</p> <p><strong>Guess whose coming to dinner</strong></p> <p><strong> Campylobacter </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> The most common food-poisoning bug in Britain, responsible for 43,445 cases in 2003 and causing about 80 deaths a year. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Raw and undercooked poultry, red meat, unpasteurised milk, untreated water. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Very potent. Just a few bacteria in a piece of undercooked chicken can cause severe illness. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Gastroenteritis with fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea that is often bloody. The most serious cases can be fatal. </p> <p> <strong> Clostridium perfringens </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it? </strong> Officially, the third most common food bacterium in the UK, although the least reported because symptoms are vague and often dismissed as IID (infectious intestinal disease). In 2000 there were 166 confirmed cases but it is estimated that only one in 343 is notified. The real total could be closer to 57,000. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Soil, sewage, animal manure and the gut of animals and humans. It can easily be transferred to poultry, meat and meat products. Foods cooked slowly in large quantities, then left to stand for a long time, are its breeding ground. Particularly associated with leftover gravy and stuffing. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Clostridium perfringens can't be completely destroyed by ordinary cooking. It produces heat-resistant spores which may even be stimulated by high temperatures, causing the spores to germinate further. Unless infected food is eaten immediately, the bacteria will multiply rapidly as the food cools down. It must be reheated to 'piping hot' (ideally 75 C) to be safe. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> When ingested in large numbers, the bacteria produce toxins which attack the gut lining, causing diarrhoea and acute abdominal pain. </p> <p> <strong> E.coli 0157 </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Most strains of E.coli are harmless, but those producing the poison verocytoxin (VTEC) can cause severe illness. Of these, E.coli 0157 is the most common in Britain. A small number of cases (675 last year) have serious repercussions. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Farm animals and land contaminated with their faeces. Among foods, E.coli is transmitted most commonly through undercooked minced beef (such as burgers) and milk that is raw, inadequately pasteurised or contaminated after pasteurisation. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> The bacterium can spread directly from animals to humans and from person to person. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea. In serious cases, kidney failure, severe anaemia, neurological problems and death. </p> <p> <strong> Listeria </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Full name listeria monocytogenes, a food-poisoning bug of particular danger to pregnant women, babies and the elderly. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Everywhere in the environment, because it can survive at low temperatures (most bacteria require warmth to thrive). Foods most at risk are soft, mould-ripened cheeses, pt\u00e9s, unpasteurised milk and shellfish. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Resists heat, salt, nitrite (preservative) and acidity better than many micro-organisms. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Can be fatal to the elderly, the immune-impaired, infants and developing foetuses. </p> <p> <strong> Salmonella </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> The second most common cause of food poisoning after campylobacter (14,853 cases in 2003), widespread in eggs and poultry flocks in the 1980s. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Despite the poultry industry cleaning up its act with new codes of practice and the Lion Quality assurance scheme, salmonella is still found in eggs - at about the same levels as before the Edwina Currie debacle. Other sources are raw meat, poultry, unpasteurised milk, yeast - even pasta, coconut and chocolate. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Grows very well in the food itself, so a tiny number of bacteria will multiply to thousands of millions if the product is not chilled. Salmonella is also passed easily from person to person by poor hygiene, such as not washing hands. </p> <p> <strong> Symptoms</strong> Usually mild, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea but rarely vomiting. </p> <p> <strong> Scrombotoxin </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Not a bug as such, but a poison produced by certain bacteria present in oily fish which has been allowed to spoil through inadequate refrigeration. It causes a dramatic histamine reaction. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Fresh and tinned mackerel, tuna and, very rarely, Swiss cheese. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Once produced, the toxin is heat-resistant. Cooking, canning or freezing will have no effect. Contaminated food will not look, taste or smell any different from usual. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Tingling or burning in the mouth, a rash on the face or upper body, itching, sweating and headache, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting may follow.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jools Oliver, ex-model, mother and wife of Jamie</strong> <br> Interview by Nicki Sprinz</p> <p>'On a sunny day, sitting here at the Brew House Cafe is like being in the middle of the countryside; the views are really amazing and you never feel as though you're in central London. The cafe sells great ice creams and home-made cakes - they're delicious. It can be difficult to feed the girls in restaurants when I'm by myself, but I'm comfortable here. I love to take the girls out every afternoon and here they can run around and enjoy the sunshine. Poppy and Daisy really enjoy the novelty of eating outside, plus it means I don't have to do any clearing up after them. </p> <p>I enjoy cooking now, but the truth is I used to hate it. Food only became important when I moved in with Jamie. I used to come back from a day's modelling and eat supermarket ready-meals. Naturally, I've picked up a few skills from living with him. During the week I'm home every night while Jamie works at the restaurant. That's when I dabble in the kitchen - without him there looking over my shoulder. </p> <p>At the weekends it's a real treat because Jamie does all the cooking - the kids' meals get more exotic, he experiments with new recipes and ideas and I stay out of the kitchen. </p> <p>Jamie and I always really like the idea of going out to eat, but when it comes to the crunch we mostly stay in and watch a DVD. If we do go out we like to go to Nobu [on Park Lane, London W1] - no one bothers us there. </p> <p>It is when we go food shopping that people tend to stare. In the supermarket they seem interested in what we are buying - although I think they're probably more interested in Jamie's purchases than mine!' </p> <p> <strong> The Brew House</strong> <br>Kenwood House <br>Hampstead Lane <br>London NW3 <br>020 8341 5384 </p> <p> <strong>Alek Wek, model</strong> <br>Interview by Zoe Smith</p> <p>'There's nothing better than sitting outside on the deck at La Bottega on a hot summer's day surrounded by magnolia trees and white lanterns. The range of people who go there is just so diverse and the range of food on offer is a real treat. It's the perfect place to pop in to after work. </p> <p>My favourite dish is grilled tuna with steamed spinach on the side. I usually have it with a salad. I always try to make sure that whatever I eat is balanced as I like to have my greens and my protein. </p> <p>It's a really casual place to dine. You have views of Chelsea so one of the nice things about eating there is that you're not just stuck in some restaurant; you actually have a sense of where you are. I don't really buy into the whole hype that surrounds many of the restaurants in New York but I do enjoy the sort of places where the people are pleasant and the food is great. I can't understand why people go to a restaurant and sit there tossing and turning to see who else is dining there. Me? If I'm hungry and I go to a restaurant I want to sit down and eat. Some people get all dolled up and that's fine but I rarely feel like dressing up. As long as I'm clean, it's all good. </p> <p>I don't really worry too much about what I eat but I can't just stuff my face with any kind of food. I think that's good in a way because, even though it sounds corny, what you eat is what you are. Breakfast is a must for me and lunch, too, because I run around all day and need something in my belly. </p> <p>I love La Bottega but I don't go there too often because cooking is one of my passions. I pick up culinary influences from all the places I've travelled to but what I always crave is the sort of food that I used to hate when I was young. When I'm at home I like to prepare things like ochre stew with onions and fish, chicken or beef. My mum always sends my dried ochre in the post so I never run out of the stuff. </p> <p>Stews feature a lot in Sudanese food and they're often eaten with rice or brown bread or kisra which is similar to a pancake, but much lighter. My mum does the most amazing cabbage stew that she steams, simmers and tosses. It's delicious. Unfortunately there aren't any Sudanese restaurants in New York but my friends don't mind because they can always order original Sudanese food at my place. </p> <p>When I'm away from New York I miss the fact that you can eat at times when in other cities everything is closed. Sometimes in London, I think that I can eat when I finish working late, only to find that everything is closed. But it's never a catastrophe because I can always pop round to my mum's for some good food.' </p> <p> <strong> La Bottega</strong> <br>The Maritime Hotel <br>363 West 16th Street <br>New York NY10011 <br>001 212 242 4300 <br><a href=\"http://www.themaritimehotel.com\">www.themaritimehotel.com</a></p> <p><strong>Mourad Mazouz, restaurateur</strong> <br>Interview by Rebecca Seal</p> <p>'In Paris there are a few little bistros that I really love - and this is my favourite. Ramulaud serves traditional French food and is run by a great big guy with a huge moustache who also happens to be an ex-communist. He's arrogant in that very hilarious Parisian way. He and his waiters have all been there for years and it doesn't take long to be treated like a local. </p> <p>Now when I go I don't order from the menu; I just sit down and they bring me things to try. The staff are quite firm though - if they think you're ordering the wrong wine for the food they say so. </p> <p>Once I arrived on my moped for lunch but there were no vacant tables. So I just wheeled the bike in between two tables, sat on it and waited. The waiter came, took my order, and brought me a delicious lunch. I ate it balancing on the bike. </p> <p>I miss places like it when I'm in London. I miss the neighbourliness of Paris. I love sitting outside a bistro watching the world pass, close to the other tables, listening to the other people talk, the regulars, the old drunk guy mumbling on his own, the people who come in every day. I haven't found that in London. </p> <p>There was another little bistro in Paris that I loved very much when I lived there but it closed down a few years ago. The couple who ran it were in their seventies - they had had the restaurant for nearly 50 years. But every night they would have a huge fight, throw plates of food on the floor, scream about how much one had ruined the other's life, right in the middle of the restaurant. And the next night they would be there again, quietly serving food until one of them made a mistake and then the show would start all over again. </p> <p>I try and go to Paris as much as possible. When I really want to forget about my work in London [Mourad runs the restaurants Momo and Sketch] I check in to a little hotel and head for Ramulaud.' </p> <p> <strong> Le Ramulaud</strong> <br>269, rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine <br>75011 Paris <br>00 33 1 43 72 23 29 </p> <p><strong>Thandie Newton, actress</strong> <br> Interview by Chloe Diski</p> <p>'I just love this place. When I first came here six years ago, I didn't get a feel for the atmosphere because it was at night. The River Cafe is still magical in the evening because you can see lights over the Thames, but it's in the day when the sun is out that you really appreciate where it is. I love sitting by this particular stretch of the river Thames, surrounded by great architecture and it's incredibly peaceful. </p> <p>I first met Ruth Rogers [co-owner of the restaurant] at my friend [the artist]Sam Taylor-Wood's house. I remember Sam saying to me, 'Oh God, Ruth is coming and I'm really nervous because I've got to cook for her.' That evening I had this really bizarre moment when I just found myself giving Ruthie a hug. I was shocked at myself and said, 'Oh my God. I'm so sorry.' I knew what I was doing (I don't drink), but it was such an unconscious act. Ruthie has that incredible aura. </p> <p>It is a great place to take children: the staff offer food straight away if they see you have a kid and they don't mind if they play on the lawn in front - in fact, they encourage it by putting a couple of Spacehoppers out for them to bounce on. </p> <p>The second time I came here, I had the chocolate nemesis and that was it - I was hooked. The River Cafe serves seasonal food but thank God chocolate doesn't have a season. At the moment my favourite dish is sea bass with cherry tomatoes and anchovies - it is unbelievable. I love the bruschetta with Cornish crab, too (I'm from Cornwall so it reminds me of home). </p> <p>Often when I go out to eat, I sometimes feel that the chef is just trying to show off. Here they seem to want to celebrate the food, not themselves. Here they uncover the food. It's naked. It's what real Italian food is all about.' </p> <p> <strong> The River Cafe</strong> <br>Thames Wharf, <br>Rainville Road, London <br>020 7386 4200 </p> <p><strong>Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, interior designer</strong> <br> Interview by Rebecca Seal</p> <p>'I am a creature of habit so I always have tuna tartare and then seared fillet of beef when I come here, although the rest of the menu is lovely. I only drink vodka with lunch - wine gives me a hangover. I might sometimes have frogs' legs and a little foie gras starter. Youcef, the new chef, does little amuses bouches too - today we had a little roast breast of quail and scallops. I'm a big protein fan, sort of a reformed Atkinser - which is such a boy's diet after all. I like food that is recognisably meat. Like an ear. Or offal. I'm fighting the onset of a 40-year-old's rotundity, especially since giving up smoking at Christmas. The upsetting thing is that, since stopping, I haven't eaten more, I just seem to absorb every last calorie. </p> <p>My friend Frank and I have lunch here at least once a week - my offices are just round the corner. My wife Jackie came with us last week, which is quite rare, since Frank and I have a tendency either to sit around discussing the exact stipple technique William Hogarth used in the 1720s or fart jokes. I think she was a bit shocked. It's wonderful to have lunch in the sun now that they have this garden. It is in huge contrast to the inside, which is really quite dark. If you think back 10 years, no restaurant had a garden and now everyone is dragging tables outside - which actually only makes sense if you're somewhere nice like this and not in Piccadilly Circus. </p> <p>The Spread Eagle is an old coaching inn and the garden is the old coach yard. It's always been a part of the real Greenwich - the old theatrical, randy, bawdy, sailor-infested Greenwich, which I find really rather horny and love the idea of bringing more of that back. The whole place is about the contrast of slum and splendour, even if now the slums are all furnished by Ikea and have Changing Rooms on the telly in the corner. </p> <p>I am emphatically not good at cooking, as Mrs Llewelyn-Bowen will testify. I am a phenomenally talented and really very enthusiastic pot-washer but I can't even make salad dressing properly. I can just about bring pasta to the boil, but there is a fair chance it will take on some strange and unthought-of consistency during the cooking process. We eat out a huge amount as a family and my kids aren't at all fussy; if they don't see anything on the menu they like, they won't moan and whinge to us, but will quietly ask the waiter if they could just have some pasta. I think that shows that if the worst should happen, they would be able to survive, especially in Knightsbridge.' </p> <p><strong>The Spread Eagle Restaurant </strong> <br>1 &amp; 2 Stockwell St <br>Greenwich , London SE10 9JB <br>020 8853 2333 </p> <p> <strong>Alberta Ferretti, fashion designer</strong> <br> Interview by Allegra Donn</p> <p>'The wonderful thing about Italy is that you don't have to travel far to taste different types of food. This is because Italian cuisine is very much based on local produce; if you're by the sea, it'll be fish, if you're inland, it'll be more meat-based. It is as simple as that. </p> <p>The Vicolo Santa Lucia offers a traditional type of cooking from the area - it is on the Adriatic coast near Rimini - with an oriental twist. </p> <p>I was born in Cattolica and my clothes factory is nearby, so I am here at least two days a week. For me it is a little haven, away from the noisy crowds of the Adriatic coast. </p> <p>If I want something light I have the freshly grilled tuna with vegetables. If I really feel like something special, I'll order the \u00ebmezze maniche [literally: short sleeved pasta] or the sea bass with olives and potatoes. The sushi and sashimi are also delicious and if I have pudding it'll usually be the plate of different ice creams mixed with fruits and caramel. </p> <p>At lunchtime I don't touch alcohol, but in the evening I always have a glass of white wine. My favourite is from a producer in Friulli called Josko Gravner, which is quite hard to come by. The owner produces it in small quantities and he matures it in earthenware containers rather than in wooden barrels as most vineyards do today. </p> <p>The setting of the restaurant is wonderful - it is by the swimming pool and beyond that is the sea.' </p> <p><strong> Vicolo Santa Lucia</strong> <br>Carducci 76 <br>Viale Carducci 76 <br>47841 Cattolica <br>Italy <br>00 39 0541 954677 </p> <p><strong>Beach shacks to restaurants - great alfresco eating places in Britain </strong> <br>Compiled by Sue Webster and Viola Fort</p> <p> <strong> Baywatch Beach Restaurant</strong> </p> <p> The Waterfront, St Helens, Isle of Wight </p> <p>01983 873259; <a href=\"http://www.bay-watch.co.uk\">www.bay-watch.co.uk</a> </p> <p>'Pretty posh', but a beach cafe nonetheless during the day, Baywatch morphs into a restaurant at night - with 12 large tables outside.

  "<p>My first car? A Renault 5, orange, \u00a315, window mould and holes in the boot. Second car: Fiat 127, blue, \u00a3350, more rust than Iron Maiden. Third: VW Polo, \u00a3900, maroon, stained seats and only one working lock... you get the picture. Can you judge a man by the cars he has owned? Do they form a sort of motoring CV? If so, you'll know that a) style has never been an issue for me, b) neither has performance, and c) my parents aren't rich. What you won't know is the sheer excitement (and relief) that getting into a new car brings me. Having spent so many years on the rough end of motoring's affections, I really know how to appreciate the smooth. I'm a family man with three young children, and a slobbering dog, and I hope that through these pages you'll get to read not about torque outputs and maximum axle weights, but about which cars make your kids feel nauseous, and which models will make your neighbours sick with envy.</p> <p><strong>Your questions answered</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> What on earth does all the jargon mean in car ads? It's just another example of boys being boys playing with their toys. Why can't they just say what they mean? <br><strong>Eleanor Dawson, York</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hi Eleanor, When it comes to small ads, an acronym saves you lineage and therefore money. But as you say, speaking in capital letters also becomes a game in which lonely men who spend their days scanning 'cars for sale' columns can pretend what they're doing is more glamorous than it is. Recently, however, Network Q teamed up with the Plain English Campaign to produce a jargon-free guide to dealerspeak, which included terms such as: </p> <p>18AW - 18in alloy wheels; FAR - front armrest; ESR - electric sunroof; and ICE - in-car entertainment. But even spelling these terms out can bamboozle anybody who doesn't think it's fun to spend weekends lying on your back covered in oil (on second thoughts...). My favourite ad, which I spotted in the Salisbury Journal, stated simply: </p> <p>'Mrs pregnant, Porsche got to go - gutted.' I was never sure whether he was gutted at having to sell his car, or because his wife was expecting. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Mr Love, Which car offers the most comfortable back-seat shag? <br><strong>Caroline, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Sex in cars should never be about comfort, and always about excitement. If it's comfort you're after, a Transit van will do the job. If it's excitement, try the still-warm bonnet of a red E-Type.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Last time I looked the upper speed limit on all Britain's roads was 70mph. Why then do manufacturers make vehicles that can do 150mph? And why do people like yourself go on about how fast cars are? Don't you realise that speeding is illegal, dangerous and stupid!<br><strong>Alastair McKay, Bath</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Alastair, You're right, the speed limit is 70, though you could be forgiven for thinking it was 90. On your behalf I phoned the press office at Mercedes to ask them why they made such fast cars. Their spokeswoman said: 'We make cars according to the market demand for them. Our customers want fast cars and so that's what we give them.' She did point out that Mercedes has led the way in innovative safety developments, airbags, crumple zones, etc. As to your point about us journalists... well, you're right, of course. However, I have a no-nonsense wife who has little faith in my driving ability, so hopefully you'll find reviews on these pages which take the macho out of motoring. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Martin, My mother-in-law is 74 years old and her trusty Polo has finally driven itself into the ground. She wants something similar and has a budget of about \u00a37,000. She says this will be her 'last' vehicle. Any suggestions? <br><strong>Jackie, Dorset</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> 'Last' sounds a bit final. I'm tempted to suggest a leather-clad Harley so she can go out in a blaze of glory. For \u00a37,000, she has plenty of options, but the one that'll turn most heads at the bingo is the new Fiat Panda - and she'll save \u00a31,000. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I'm fed up with driving the mass-produced cars that are churned out these days and have decided to buy a classic. But I don't know anything about cars. Do you have any tips/pointers for the lazy vintage enthusiast? <br><strong>Ian Wickes, Leeds</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Today's cars are like Stepford wives. Efficient and reliable, but scarily boring, so a classic is a great idea. The first thing to do is decide what you want to drive, then contact the owner's club of that make. They'll give you all the help and advice you need to find a car and then, importantly, keep it on the road. Auctions are another avenue to explore, see <a href=\"http://www.classic-car-auction.co.uk\">www.classic-car-auction.co.uk</a> for details. It's worth remembering that cars made before 31 December 1972 pay no road tax and are cheap to insure. My neighbour, for instance, bought an Austin A35 (his fifth) for \u00a31,800 and has insured it for a year for \u00a390. Another alternative is to join a members' collective, such as the <a href=\"http://www.classiccarclub.co.uk\">Classic Car Club</a>, where for an annual fee you can drive any of its fleet of immaculate vintage cars.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hi, We thought it might be a laugh to drive to the Olympics. We've got our hands on an old Land Rover. We figured we could sleep in the back. Do you think we'll make it? Baz and Chris, Birmingham</p> <p><strong>A</strong> The games start on 13 August, so you have five days to drive 2,500 miles. Better get started. When you get there, report to the British Team office.</p> <p>They could do with all the help they can get.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 22 2004</strong></p> <p>The article below reported: 'In India, US charity Population Communications International sees its joint venture Detective Vijay as a \"magic weapon\" in the battle against Aids.' PCI actually has no connection with Detective Vijay, which is produced by BBC World Service Trust. </p> <p></p> <p>The BBC's latest medical drama, Taste of Life, may prove to be one of the most important programmes in the corporation's history. Set in a busy hospital with a young cast of sexually active doctors and nurses, it doesn't exactly sound ground-breaking, but former EastEnders producer Matthew Robinson reckons his new soap has the potential to change lives. Taste of Life, you see, isn't set in a fictional town in the South-West or an inner London teaching hospital, the drama unfolds in Phnom Penh and isn't meant just to entertain, it is designed to save viewers' lives. </p> <p>It's an example of 'edutainment' - the new buzzword in overseas aid - and is one of a raft of soaps currently being produced with western cash and talent in the developing world. Taste of Life 's opening storyline features a pregnant 16-year-old who is rushed to hospital when her back-street abortion goes wrong. So far, so soap; but Robinson promises that this is revolutionary stuff. 'Cambodians have never seen anything like it,' he says on the phone from Phnom Penh. It's difficult to convey to a British audience what an effect a show like Taste of Life , which begins this month, can have. </p> <p>'There is no history of TV drama here and what is on telly tends to be imported Chinese movies and Thai comedy shows,' says Robinson. 'Of course it doesn't help that there are only a few voice-over artists in the country, which means every character from 15 to 50 sounds the same! The only programmes produced in the native Khmer language tend to be quiz and karaoke shows.' The fact that Taste of Life is in Khmer and features native actors and locations guarantees it the attention of its audience. Which hopefully means the show's educational message will be taken seriously. </p> <p> Taste of Life 's production costs are being met by the Department for International Development as part of a \u00a33 million plan to combat the spread of HIV/Aids and decrease infant mortality in Cambodia, a country with the highest infection rates in South-East Asia and where a third of all children die before their fifth birthday. Like an increasing number of aid providers, DfID knows that a soap's arsenal of story-telling tricks - cliffhangers, charismatic heroes and reassuring sceptics - reaches a far greater audience than any straightforward educational message about condom use. The girl whose abortion goes wrong is later seen receiving advice from wise and appealing regular characters about safe sex. The message is clear but not dogmatic - cool people think using condoms is a good idea. </p> <p>The day-to-day running of the soap is managed by the BBC's editorially independent charitable wing, the World Service Trust, an agency set up to marry the skills of the BBC with outside sources of funding to improve broadcasting standards around the world. In the past 10 years, similar joint ventures have produced amazing results. In Somalia a radio drama encouraged 30,000 people to sign up for literacy courses, and in India 200,000 people were motivated to seek medical help for their leprosy when they saw that their condition was treatable and not an affliction from the gods. In Afghanistan, the World Service's New Home, New Life recently had much to celebrate on its tenth birthday. 'During the Soviet occupation, the Taliban and the American bombing, it carried storylines that kept people alive,' explains the Trust's Nusrat Ul-ghani. 'When we knew people were thinking about leaving refugee camps because the aid wasn't getting through, we ran a story encouraging them to stay put otherwise the aid agencies wouldn't have known where to find them. And when people were hiding from air raids we featured a story warning people not to take shelter in ruins as these often contained landmines.' </p> <p>The soap genre can clearly be used to convey an infinite variety of messages but it is currently popular with HIV/Aids charities wanting to reach young people. In Peru USAID (the American equivalent of DfID) funded Time For Love with the aim of empowering young women to say no to sexual advances. In India US charity Population Communication International sees its joint venture Detective Vijay as a 'magic weapon' in the battle against Aids. In South Africa a similar message has been broadcast through a series of dramas set in the fictional Soul City. It has been so popular, getting 16 million viewers a week, that one township has renamed itself in honour of the soap. </p> <p>As televisions become more widely available in the developing world, so the number of edutainment soaps has grown. There are now so many projects that in September broadcast executives and aid workers will get together at the fourth annual Education Entertainment convention in South Africa. Not all projects on the agenda are TV soaps however, as the costs are high and access to TV is limited outside cities. In rural areas radio soaps are often more effective, even though they have trickier problems to deal with. </p> <p>Unlike the HIV-prevention soaps where script writers have endless sexual shenanigans to entice an audience, the authors of a Bolivian radio soap have to make reducing deaths from diarrhoea a gripping subject. And spare a thought for the writers of a Unesco-backed soap in Myanmar that seeks to inform listeners about human trafficking. In Kenya the writers of Move With The Times deserve special credit for making a storyline about combatting the maize stalk-borer so engrossing that it significantly improved harvests last year. </p> <p> Move With The Times, produced by British charity the Mediae Trust, receives funding from the DfID but also relies on commercial sponsors to pay for its airtime. Balancing the two interests can sometimes require diplomacy. </p> <p>'At the moment we have a mobile phone sponsor,' says David Campbell, director of Mediae, 'as mobile phones are a big issue in rural Kenya. They let people find out about the prices for their crops and enable them to sell at the right time in the right market.' As well as paying for advertising, Safaricom gets a little bit of product placement. When Cadbury was sponsoring Move With The Times, characters would occasionally sit down to a nice cup of cocoa. For obvious reasons, they have never had an agricultural sponsor. </p> <p>Of course product placement is nothing new - nor is it necessarily nefarious. But the blurring of charitable motives with commercial opportunities worries commentators. Some of the safe sex soaps, for example, are funded by condom brands or Christian groups preaching abstinence. In post-Soviet Kazakhstan a few years ago, a soap featuring heroes in branded jeans and smoking American cigarettes was thought to have contributed to the country's rapid adoption of capitalism. </p> <p>With western governments, corporations and churches putting the money in and senior personnel coming from the ranks of multinational broadcasters, there is understandably a concern that these soaps, albeit unintentionally, become mouthpieces for western values, products and aspirations; and it is this 'West knows best' attitude that most upsets critics. There is also discomfort that these charities may be creating an appetite for programming that one day will, presumably, have to be paid for by adverts for expensive trainers, tobacco and other items the developing world doesn't really need. </p> <p>These concerns are expressed by Africa2000, a media pressure group. Because edutainment comes across as an indigenous art form, they argue, suspicions about the message's origin or intent are not raised. According to them, edutainment 'provides both the casual exposure and the opportunity for repetition that is critical to a major propaganda undertaking'. </p> <p>For Matthew Robinson though, the enormous benefits outweigh the ideological concerns: 'These soaps are monitored and researched and don't get the next year's funding if there's not a demonstrable shift in people's behaviour. The medium works,' he says. He is confident that Taste of Life will be a success: 'There is no history of writing TV scripts here, there isn't even a history of writing novels. This is a country where half the population is under 18 and where anyone who could have taught the younger generation about the creative industries was murdered by Pol Pot.' </p> <p>Taste of Life isn't just Cambodia's first soap, it is one of the few stories Cambodia has told about itself for a generation. The country has been too occupied rebuilding its infrastructure after years of civil war to have devoted many of its resources to the arts and Robinson has had to recruit straight from the universities, employing graduates from all subjects to be writers, costume designers, prop-buyers etc. Taste of Life's legacy, like that of other edutainment vehicles, may not just be improvement in HIV infection rates or infant mortality statistics, it will be the creation of a skills base from which the Cambodians can forge their own industry. And that could give voice to stories that might otherwise go untold. </p> <p>The genre devised to sell soap powder to the masses, it would seem, has found a higher purpose.</p>",
  "<p>Ever since I had my daughter Eleanor 20 months ago my husband Matt and I have had no desire to travel abroad. Why put yourselves through the potential stress of being stranded at the airport for hours due to flight delays when you can holiday quite happily nearer to home? </p> <p>Our theory was backed up by the experiences of friends and family who had dared to leave British soil with their young offspring. My sister and husband took their baby daughter to Italy when she was only a few months old. Georgia didn't stop crying from taking off at Gatwick to landing back there a week later (OK, a slight exaggeration but let's just say my sister looked far worse when she got home than when she had left). </p> <p>When I asked Caroline, another new mum, if she had enjoyed her trip to Greece with her six-month-old daughter Emily she wasn't exactly ecstatic. 'I wished I'd stayed at home,' she groaned. 'The flight was delayed by five hours on the way out and Emily didn't seem to like the heat.' </p> <p>I have to admit that my resistance to foreign travel has also been fuelled by Matt's tendency to lose his rag at airports. Being bumped off a flight or delays of more than two hours send him into a rage and the thought of having a child in tow has made the prospect even more daunting. </p> <p>So, it was with some trepidation that we set off on our first overseas jaunt: a family cruise round the Mediterranean. Fortunately the outward journey went relatively smoothly. We discovered the joys of airport parking (no struggling on the tube with suitcases and cheaper than a cab) and were very relieved to hear that our flight to Barcelona was not delayed. My sister had warned me to take a whole load of new toys to keep Eleanor entertained but she was quite happy playing with the seatbelt and flirting with the other passengers. As another child screamed its way through the entire two-hour flight we were the smug parents with the beautifully behaved child in seat numbers 20 and 21. </p> <p>The situation had somewhat deteriorated by the time we arrived at the port. Eleanor, by this time needing to sleep, started to lose it in the cab and had a full-blown tantrum as we boarded the ship. We rushed past the cheery cruise photographer attempting to take our picture; it wouldn't have been the best happy family holiday snap. </p> <p>I have to admit that I had never really associated cruising with family holidays, holding the stereotypical view of the average cruise passenger being 'overfed and nearly dead'. But I was staggered by the number of families on our ship, Brilliance of the Seas. The week before our cruise - half-term week - an amazing 700 of the 2,000 passengers had been children. Obviously some cruise ships are more child friendly than others. Our cruise line, Royal Caribbean International, has a children's club, Adventure Ocean, which offers a huge range of activities for three to 17-year-olds. Many of the ships have children's pools and slides, rock climb ing walls and some even boast ice-skating rinks. </p> <p>Our cabin was surprisingly child-friendly, with fold-down beds for older children and travel cots supplied for babies and toddlers. There was a thick curtain you could pull across to separate the sleeping area from the lounge so we didn't have to sit in complete darkness while Eleanor had her lunchtime sleep. The only downside of the cabin was that there was no bath, and she didn't take too kindly to being hosed down every night in the shower. </p> <p>When we had been planning our cruise, Matt and I had been a bit wimpy about the excursions. Initially excited by the prospect of day trips to Florence, Pompeii and the island of Capri, we reasoned that long coach trips and trailing after tour guides in the searing heat with a toddler in tow wouldn't be much fun. Instead we spent a lovely morning in the Corsican capital Ajaccio visiting Napoleon's museum, wandering the narrow streets and sitting in a waterside cafe while Eleanor slept in her pushchair. From Livorno we went on an excursion to Pisa, a 30-minute drive away, which is just about as long as we can take on a coach with a toddler. In Naples we decided to negotiate the city on foot, which turned out to be the highlight of our trip. We spent a wonderful afternoon discovering crumbling churches and beautiful little squares. Eleanor was quite content to sit in her pushchair and take it all in. When she did get bored and wanted to get out and walk we bribed her with ice cream. </p> <p>And what of life aboard? Eleanor loved it. She lapped up the attention from both passengers - many of whom were Italian and Spanish and made a great fuss of her - and staff, who were friendly and helpful. She had a great time exploring the ship - most of which is surrounded by high balconies (a great relief when you have an adventurous toddler) - and going up and down in the glass lifts overlooking the atrium. </p> <p>My only disappointment was finding out that Eleanor couldn't use the children's pool because she wasn't toilet trained. However, we did flout the rules and sneak her in a few times when members of staff weren't looking. It wasn't a problem when we were in port and could go off and do things but our last day was spent completely at sea and we did run out of things to do. </p> <p>So what did other families think of life on the ocean waves? Initially sceptical about cruising, first timers Jo and David Brown and their four-year-old daughter Lucy and 22-month-old Charlotte from Stockport were thoroughly enjoying the trip. The family had been used to doing more independent holidays until three and a half years ago when David was blinded by a bomb in Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Jo said: 'Everything is so easy. It's good that the destinations come to you, rather than you having to go to them. The ship's a lot less stuffy and claustrophobic than I had imagined and you don't have to worry about the kids upsetting people. The staff are really friendly. I'd definitely do it again.' </p> <p>Jonathan and Yulie Wagman from Manchester, also first-time cruisers, were impressed by how the staff had catered for their seven-month-old Benji. 'It's all been really easy. They prepared steamed white fish and vegetables and were quite happy to wash and sterilise bottles. We weren't comfortable using babysitters but brought our own walkie-talkies so we could go and have dinner,' said Jonathan. </p> <p>Matt and I were more than happy to use a babysitter. We went out together more in one week than we had since Eleanor was born. When the babysitter arrived we'd nip off for a swim and then come back and change for dinner. One night we went really wild and saw a show. By the end of the week we really felt like we'd had a proper holiday. </p> <p>Unfortunately our flight home was less successful. Eleanor had a sense of humour failure when the flight attendant wouldn't let her sit in her own seat for the takeoff (she was too young) and screamed the whole way home. She was escorted off the plane by a couple of zombies who felt like they'd just flown back from Los Angeles, not Barcelona. It's amazing how quickly that holiday feeling can wear off.</p> <p><strong>Factfile </strong></p> <p>Liz Bird and family travelled with <a href=\"http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk\">Royal Caribbean International</a> (0800 018 2020) on a five-night cruise from Barcelona, which starts from \u00a3665pp for an outside cabin, including flights. </p> <p>Brilliance of the Seas is sailing a series of 12-night Mediterranean fly-cruise holidays out of Barcelona until October.

  "<p>You have always been the most communicative of readers. Your mail arrives at my door by the sackful, couriered to my home with the weekly barrage of press releases, piles of review books and food samples. Now you have a working email address for me, you might actually get a reply within weeks rather than months. I'm sorry if some of your queries have disappeared into the ether. One day there were so many I had to phone the server to unblock my system. Of course, it wasn't only your questions that choked my Mac, but the usual mishmash of friends saying hello, PR drivel and the neverending offers of porn and other things I would rather not think about. If any of you failed to fill in the subject box, I'm afraid you got deleted. I have learnt the hard way not to open emails from women called Shelley. And while I reckon I am pretty sharp at spotting unwanted spam, one or two did get the better of me. How was I to know that an email labelled 'Have Some Cannelloni Tony' would turn out not to be one of your cookery questions, but an Italian gay porn film on DVD? </p> <p>I wish I had room to answer all your queries - sadly, I would need the entire magazine to myself. Instead I have picked the ones I feel will be of interest to as many people as possible. Really technical questions or pleas for recipes I have hedged. Oh, and thank you all for the advice about the squirrels and foxes and slugs that plague my kitchen garden, and for asking about the cats. They are fine, if getting a little elderly.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hello Nigel, I can't do puddings at all. I tried to make your very quick chocolate cake for a friend's birthday and that went wrong - I'd have been better off just bringing in the Valrhona for people to gorge on. What can I make that will be lovely and foolproof? Please help me - there are sometimes some evenings when only a pudding will do, and now I am scared of them. Hope your cats are OK. <br><strong>Love from Suzanne</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hi Suzanne, It's not you - it's the recipe. That Quick Chocolate Cake recipe is crap. It is one of those recipes (now about 12 years old) that will haunt me till the end of my days. I guess every cookery writer has one - the recipe we wish we had never done. Tear it out and have a go instead at the Chocolate Espresso Cake in my book Real Food (\u00a312.99, 4th Estate), the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake in Appetite (\u00a315, 4th Estate) or the brownies I did in this column a couple of weeks ago. </p> <p>But then, there is no real reason why you have to make a pudding yourself. The French and Italians are perfectly happy to go and buy that bit of the meal from the shops without apology. There is no shame in buying something in if it's good. The British have this strange idea that we must do everything ourselves. We don't. So if you can't make pudding, then don't. Make something else.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Why do you only give metric measurements for the recipes? It has infuriated me for years, and I have longed to demand why. It isn't just the inconvenience of my cake tins all being in inches, or the irrational nostalgia I have for still using my mother's old cream-enamel weighing scales from the Fifties, or even the fact that I can't instinctively cut 100g of butter like I can 2oz. I am a teacher, and the maths curriculum we have to teach to ages seven to 12 includes both the metric system and the imperial one. Children have to know how much a pint is and a yard, as well as a litre and metre.</p> <p>I know the government insists every butcher displays the kilo price, but everyone I stand next to is still asking for a pound of sausages and getting served without query.<br><strong> Yours, Ms G Bennett</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Oh, for heaven's sake. Did you make all this fuss when we changed to decimal currency? Do you still demand that shopkeepers tell you the price in pounds, shillings and pence? No, of course you don't. We are only talking about a new set of scales, Ms Bennett, not a sex change.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, I tend to use sherry vinegar the most in my cooking (having followed your advice), but when should I use all the other vinegars in my store cupboard? I've got balsamic, red, white and cider vinegar, plus lemon and lime juice. Hope you're still swimming (and eating ice cream).<br><strong> Alwyn Jackson, Rochdale</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Yes, Mr Jackson, I'm still eating ice cream. That is why I have to do all the swimming. There are so many wonderful vinegars about, from rich, mellow balsamic to light, fruity raspberry, and many in between. All are worth a try. I tend to sip them, then decide what will work best. It is worth remembering that in matters of taste there is no right and wrong, so if you want to put balsamic vinegar on your ice cream, then why not? Italians do.</p> <p>On a daily basis I use an Italian red-wine vinegar for most things - it is my knee-jerk vinegar - but I do use a white one from time to time. Much depends on how rich you want a salad dressing to be. Sherry vinegar is perfect with walnut oil and for wintry salads, and is just fabulous with mushrooms. (Try sprinkling on a little before you bake them.) I am very partial to a drop of French tarragon vinegar, especially if it is going to accompany chicken. Try adding a shake or two to the gravy for roast chicken, or a neat drizzle on freshly steamed runner beans. Cider vinegar is good in any salad containing nuts and is something I will happily use with oily fish such as mackerel. </p> <p>I sometimes add a dash to the gravy for a pork roast. It seems to bring the pan juices to life. Have you ever tried balsamic vinegar in home-made strawberry ice cream? Do - it adds a real depth.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I've been trying to make pesto with rocket, as I have masses of the stuff in my garden. It's a particularly peppery variety, and I wondered if you have any suggestions for adding something to make the end result less bitter. <strong>Regards, Damian</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Damian, You have reminded me, I really must plant some more rocket. I have the seeds, but keep forgetting to put them in. Few salads grow more easily, even in a large flowerpot, and I like the way you can just keep picking them all summer. Few leaves have that clean, peppery edge, though I would rather have a glut of watercress!</p> <p>Yes, rocket pesto, or salsa di ruchetta, can be on the bitter side, especially if it is made with really punchy rocket. It will be less so if you mix in a small quantity of parsley, but the underlying bitterness will still be present.</p> <p>The secret is to add just a little bit of sugar. I was against the idea at first, and tried making mine with a sweet, bland olive oil and then a little more Parmesan in an attempt to avoid adding the sugar, but in truth you really don't need much - I think you can get away with a mean teaspoon per 200g rocket, and in terms of the quantity of rocket leaves, that is almost negligible. Even so, it will make a huge difference.</p> <p>By the way, have you ever used it as a spread on bruschetta? Just fabulous, with a clean, peppery taste and masses of aromatic bite.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, It's probably thanks to you that I now use my juicer more often. And as you say, the chore of washing it seems less of a bore if you accept beforehand that cleaning it is part of the routine. </p> <p>I find it easier to keep mine on the draining board and to have a large vegetable brush handy. I often make carrot juice instead of an afternoon cup of tea for my husband and myself. My query concerns the debris left after juicing carrots. It seems such a waste to throw it away. Would it still contain any nutrients? Surely it would be worth using, if only for the fibre? <br><strong>All good wishes, Gitta Zarum</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Gitta, Juicing does produce a lot of debris. Yes, there will be a fair amount of nutrients left, not to mention a goodly sum of roughage, but this is the way I look at it: if I was really worried about losing all that, then I would be eating the carrots whole rather than juicing them. I guess we either eat the vegetables or drink them - we can't have it both ways. You could make the debris into vegetable cakes, but it sounds a bit parsimonious to me, like boiling up peelings for soup. I think the machine has taken out enough of the goodness for us to forget about the peel and pips, and just chuck it on the compost. It will probably do more good there than in our stomachs.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> However much trouble I take when making gratin dauphinois or other gratin-type dishes with milk/cream (leeks, courgettes, etc), the milk always seems to separate in cooking, leaving me with a mixture of water and curdle. How can I avoid this? I always heat the milk before putting it in the dish, and place the dish in a pre-heated oven (200C).<br><strong>Patricia Kinder, Paris</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Patricia, I think your oven temperature is a bit too high. This gorgeous dish, with its layers of velvety soft potatoes held together with thick garlicky cream, is best cooked very slowly, so that the cream and milk don't boil. About 160C should do it. Try the lower temperature, and I think the problem will disappear. As will the dauphinois.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel: Every recipe I have ever read for risotto says that it will take about 20 minutes for the rice to absorb the gradually added liquid to the right texture and consistency. I have never made risotto that hasn't taken at least twice this length of time, and also much more than the specified quantity of liquid. Why is this? <br><strong>Name withheld</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Well, there are several points here. I have said before that time is a very unreliable way to measure the progress of a dish. But it is all part of the fact that in Britain we are obsessed with following recipes word for word rather than cooking with our senses. All rice is different and it cannot be expected to cook at exactly the same speed. There are several different types of risotto rice, and the make-up of their starch cells is all slightly different. This affects the cooking time. Some rice swells quickly; others take a while to plump up with stock. The age of the rice will also make a slight difference.</p> <p>But there are other reasons why your risottos may take a while longer to cook. It may be that your stock is not as hot as usual, or that you have let the rice cook too long before adding the stock (the rice grains will harden if left too long before the liquid is added). Maybe you like your rice a little softer than the people whose recipes you follow. Personally, I think 20 minutes is somewhat pushing it anyway. Mine tend to take a bit longer - yes, sometimes as long as 40 minutes. And as to the quantity of liquid, I couldn't agree with you more. I have never found a risotto recipe that didn't underestimate the liquid quantity. I think it's so the readers won't be frightened off by how much stock they will need!</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hi Nigel, I love roast beef but I have never been able to do it successfully at home. The reason for this is that we are a small family and simply cannot afford to buy a large joint of rib or sirloin for three people. I yearn for thick, tender slices and the astonishing burst of joy in the mouth from biting into crisp, golden-brown fat with a mouthful of tender, juicy pink beef - yet what I achieve with a very small joint of topside or silverside (often sold as 'roasting joints' by supermarkets) is overcooked, dry brown meat, or nearly raw and still-tough slices, however thinly it's cut. My yearning is becoming an obsession. Is there any way to achieve a decent result with such a cut? <br><strong>Merry xxx</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Merry, It's not your cooking that needs help, it's your shopping! What are you doing buying something as important as the meat for your Sunday roast from a supermarket? They might be good for bin liners and washing-up liquid, but if there is one thing supermarkets don't do well it is meat (or fish or cheese, for that matter). If a roast is to be tender, then it has to be from meat that has been properly hung and has a good marbling of fat. My advice is to go to a (good) local butcher rather than a supermarket for your beef. Explain that you only want a small piece - and you will be surprised what he will find for you.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Why do all the food gurus and chefs think samphire needs cooking? Can you enlighten me? <br><strong>Louise Hopes</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You are right. Samphire doesn't always need cooking. But some can be excessively salty, depending on where it is grown, and cooking it will take away some of its salinity. If it is cooked lightly, for just a minute or two, it will be as fresh and bright as you could wish for and a great accompaniment to fish or, to my taste, lamb. If it is overcooked, it will be just as ghastly as overcooked cabbage. Another point: a brief plunge into boiling water will see off any unwanted bugs that may have been hanging around the seashore.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, I have never read a description of how to deal with the recalcitrant artichoke in such a way to make it seem easy rather than incredibly fiddly. Please could you enlighten me how to treat this most wonderful foodstuff? Best wishes. <br><strong>Michael Shmith, Richmond, Australia</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I too have read pages and pages of explicitly detailed instructions for dealing with this majestic and under-used vegetable. It's like: let's see how complicated we can make this, let's see if we can put everyone off this glorious vegetable! Michael, ignore it all. Don't do any of that snipping and fiddling around that everyone tells you to. Just rinse the artichokes well (insects love hiding in between the layers of leaves), drop them into furiously boiling, lightly salted water, and let them cook until you can pull away one of the leaves without much effort. Then drain.</p> <p>I eat mine by pulling out the hot leaves one at a time with my fingers and dipping them into olive oil, melted butter or a pot of hollandaise sauce. When I have pulled the flesh off each leaf with my teeth, I pull out the thistly bit from the bottom of the artichoke and discard it with the sucked leaves. (There is usually a huge pile of debris.) You will be left with a soft green cup of artichoke flesh. It's the best bit of all, though not as much fun as sucking warm butter from the leaves.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I often cook fish, especially mackerel, by covering it completely in rock salt or sea salt. Does the salt absorb all the oil and, hence, all the good omega-3s? <br><strong>Andy Stringer, Streatham</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> What an interesting question. I love this way of cooking whole fish - and chicken, too. Whole mackerels are particularly delicious baked in a covering of wet salt. They stay moist and juicy and the skin just peels away when you crack open the baked salt. But I am going to have to phone a friend over this one. Dr Briffa, who knows more about omega 3 than I do, says: 'Andrew's question stems from the notion that salt can \"draw\" fluid into it. This effect may possibly be relevant to the water content of a food, but whether it has any bearing on any fatty component is unlikely. Also, even if some omega-3 fat was lost to the salt, the chances are this would only affect the most superficial part of the fish. It is highly unlikely that salt encrustment will have much bearing on the omega-3 content of oily fish.' </p> <p>So it looks like we can keep on baking our fish in a salt crust. If you've never tried it, I recommend it. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hello Nigel, I'd really like to make panna cotta, but where I am - County Clare in Ireland - I can only get powdered gelatine. Can I use that instead? <br><strong>Thank you, Emma Stewart-Liberty </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Yes, it is infuriating that leaf gelatine is so difficult to get hold of. It is one of the reasons I so rarely run a recipe using gelatine. Most professional cooks and chefs wouldn't dream of using the powdered stuff. It causes more problems than any other ingredient I know of. We prefer leaf because, unlike the gelatine powder, it is easy to use and gives a gentler set. All you have to do is push the leaves into a bowl of cold water and let them soften for a few minutes, then drop them into the warm mixture and they will dissolve without trace. The finished mousse, souffle or panna cotta will be a more subtle affair altogether with leaf gelatine. If you were making blancmange or even a lemon mousse, I would suggest you could use either type, but not in a panna cotta. The recipe is just too delicate.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, My wife reads your column and has books and tapes from TV of all your work. So we watch this episode with you and your 'comfort food' and the bit with the new potatoes in the French soft cheese. I agree with her that it looks good, so we push the boat out (Northern saying) and purchase an Epoisses for \u00a34.99 from Tesco so we can do a retake. However, we don't even get to push our forks into the cheese for the wine to get into the Epoisses, as it just stinks!</p> <p>My question is this: this cheese, is it off, or should it really smell this bad? I have the luxurious smooth cheese, washed with Marc de Bourgogne, in front of me now, and I can tell you that its scent is stronger than that of the stuff that collects between my toes! Our house is now unsellable and the children in the street throw stones at our windows shouting, 'Smelly, smelly - we hate you.' What have you done to us? Take care, Keith and Liz</p> <p><strong>A</strong> Ah yes, Epoisses - it does pong a bit. Heaven only knows what it smells like when it gets warm. Rather you than me. I am not surprised that your neighbours were throwing stones.</p> <p>If you are going to bake a whole French cheese, then you want nothing more exotic than a good old Camembert. It will smell very cheesy, and deeply comforting, but won't upset the neighbours. Simply secure the box with a staple or two (the glued ones come undone), then bake it in a hot oven till the cheese is bubbling. Dip in stalks of celery, hot new potatoes or just crusty bread. Once everyone smells that, they'll come knocking at your door for a taste.</p> <p>PS: Stinky cheese does have its uses. I once had a ghastly time at a bed and breakfast in France. The owner was so rude that I stuffed a ripe Epoisses behind the radiator in the bedroom before I left.</p>",
  "<p>This column is the hub of my working week - everything else is fitted around it. Each week I sit down and sort of write you a letter - although I don't know who you are. Just occasionally I meet some of you or you write to me, and if you say nice things about this column that counts for as much as anything in my working life. I am pathetically easily flattered. </p> <p>But we hardly ever talk. So, after 10 years, this is the first time that I am responding to your specific gardening concerns. </p> <p>When I started to write this column, I realised that the only way that I could work was to write about my own experiences and concerns. I am entirely self-taught, which means that my day-to-day gardening in my own back yard is my centre of knowledge. My gardening life is likely to be pretty much like yours, if perhaps a little more so, given that I am completely obsessed by it. But as I get older and more experienced, I still feel hopelessly ignorant about too much. I suppose I have now learnt enough to know how little I know. </p> <p>Obviously, I am sorry if you were not one of the few I have replied to here. Some questions I rejected because they were general and others required only a brief sentence or name, but I could have easily answered 10 or 12 different sets and have been as representative.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My wife and I are keen - if a little inexperienced - gardeners and last year we bought and planted out an established (3ft high) olive tree (Olea europaea). Last year's long, hot summer brought to bear a handful of tiny fruit that never developed. We live in Cambridgeshire and have reasonably mild winters. Our garden is sheltered and is east facing and the tree itself is planted on the southern side. Am I holding out too much hope that our olive tree will bear fruit? All references I have found tend to suggest that trees rarely bear fruit outside the Mediterranean. <br><strong>Neil and Lois Rowlands</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you have fantasies of pressing your own oil a move to Tuscany would be quicker and cheaper. But it should be straightforward enough to raise an interesting and handsome plant. They like a very well-drained, light, alkaline soil and need very little water. I would definitely grow it in a pot that can be taken outside for the summer and then brought in under glass for winter, mixing a peat-free potting compost 50:50 with grit. They are tender and should be kept frost-free as far as possible, but do not make the mistake of heating them in winter and keeping the air good and dry. In spring, at the first sign of growth, water them with a seaweed solution and repeat this monthly until autumn. Put them outside at the beginning of May, but have some fleece handy in case there is a late frost, and bring them back under cover around the end of September. As with citrus, only water when the soil is bone dry. And if you do take the Tuscany option, I'm up for a bottle of the first pressing.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have had such a problem with slugs this year. They have decimated flowers and veg. My lupins didn't flower because they'd been so badly eaten; every delphinium I plant gets reduced to twigs within 48 hours; pretty much every vegetable I've planted has been eaten as soon as it pokes its head above the soil. I try to garden totally organically and I am thinking of getting some nematodes - is there a best time of year to introduce them and do they need re-applying at a certain interval? <br><strong>Yours hopefully, Alice Fox, Shipley</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> There is no easy answer to this, Alice. Slugs are with most of us and they are here to stay. Global warming means that they overwinter much more than they used to and in any realistic world we have to learn to share the garden with them. </p> <p>Slug pellets have very limited use and are harmful to the garden's ecobalance, so they are not an option. I have found various barriers, such as beer traps, grit, eggshells or even human hair, to be a waste of time, although old copper piping worked as a barrier around seedlings outside.</p> <p>All the following things will help. The parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a minute worm that infects the host with a fatal disease and, rather gratifyingly, eats the slug up from the inside. Yum. You buy them live, mixed with a clay-based agent, which must be diluted with water. The solution is then watered on to the area you wish to protect. The soil must be warm and wet for them to work and they need time to breed; normally, they only stay effective for about six weeks. Ducks, hedgehogs and beetles eat slugs and thrushes love a snail. A sawn-off plastic bottle over young seedlings works well but looks horrid. Rotovating bare soil in winter chops up some slugs and exposes others to hungry birds. </p> <p>But I prefer a more general approach. My own garden is riddled with slugs and yet I have come to an acceptable level of accommodation by working out various avoidance and diversionary tactics. To start with, I would highly recommend getting a greenhouse or at least a cold frame that can be kept more or less slug-free. I sow as much as possible in containers and grow the seedlings in this protected zone. After hardening off outside (in another area with a daily anti-slug patrol), I plant them out. By this time they are both coarse enough and growing quickly enough to resist being eaten. This system works beautifully for things like lettuce, beans, or tender annuals like cosmos. </p> <p>The other important factors are timing and feeding. Slugs like young, soft tissue, so make it available for as short a time as possible. Harden the plants off really well before planting out, so that they are acclimatised and will grow quickly. I often pick a lettuce that has a dozen small slugs secreted about it, although the leaves appear practically untouched. It means everything must be carefully washed, but that is an acceptable price to pay. </p> <p>Resist sowing or planting tender plants too soon. It is better to wait another week or so than risk losing plants, and do not feed plants more than is necessary. Feed the soil, not the plant. This will avoid a spurt of soft, sappy growth, which slugs love. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I had grown a magnificent 8ft onopordum from seed and then the Cornish gales came. I noticed that you had them as focal points in the beds at Berryfield. How do you stake them without it looking ugly?<br><strong>Jenny Blincoe, Fowey, Cornwall</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Onopordums are the prickliest, biggest, baddest thistle there is. They look fantastic, are easy to grow, and self-seed, so you only ever need buy a couple to have a supply for ever. But they are an absolute bugger to support. I get round it by using fencing stakes and thick hop twine, and even then I usually leave it too late and a storm sends them sprawling. In short, use the thickest stake you can buy and try and hide it as best you can. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> The apples on our Bramley apple tree, which we planted eight years ago, suffer badly with bitter pit. We pruned it hard back, but still the crop suffered from the brown pit marks. Is there anything we can do to remedy the situation? We have a warm and dry walled garden with several other fruit and apple trees. <br><strong>Jackie Sayer</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I like the sound of a warm and dry walled garden but therein, I suspect, lies your problem. But first three cheers for planting a Bramley. They make the best of garden trees - becoming solid and avuncular without overwhelming even a small garden and are perfect for a swing. Also, we must all fight for our orchards and mature apple trees. </p> <p>As a result of the recent withdrawal of EU subsidy, farmers are now grubbing out orchards that are extremely old, extremely beautiful and almost irreplaceable. It is a monstrous piece of eco-vandalism that is a result of the crazy CAP, tyrannical supermarkets and our willingness to tolerate cheap, tasteless food.</p> <p>Back to bitter pit. You can recognise this by the sunken pockmarks on the fruit surface. Then, when you peel the apple there are brown bits on the flesh beneath each pit. The main problem is that it dramatically reduces the apple's keeping time. It is caused by a calcium deficiency in the fruit itself and is induced by water shortage. Hence the clue in your warm and dry walled garden. If it is planted up against the warm and dry wall, it will be drier still, as any wall sucks away moisture from the ground. </p> <p>Clearly, a lot of extra watering will sort this out, but it is just as important to reduce the competition for water by clearing an area a metre in radius right round the tree and mulching this thickly with straw, grass cuttings or wood chips. Manure or compost will tend to induce too much soft growth without increasing fruit production, but it will not do any harm if it is the most convenient material to use. </p> <p>Some varieties, such as 'Newton Wonder', 'Bramley's Seedling' and 'Egremont Russet', are more susceptible to bitter pit than others, so consider an alternative to these if you live in an area of low rainfall or have a warm, dry, walled garden. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> How do you get around the problem of oriental poppies leaving holes in your planting? They are a large plant until mid-June, but then you're left with a big gap in the border when you cut them back after flowering. I have three clumps in my mixed border (of 'Karine' and 'Patty's Plum') which grow to nearly a metre in diameter each, but afterwards I'm left with a crown of about 20cm and a big bare patch all around. This year I managed to buy some tall-ish bedding - salvias and snapdragons - and I have planted these around the crowns, but I am still not convinced this is the best solution. What do you suggest? <br><strong>Sam Grover, Bristol</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hey Sam, let's call it a space rather than a hole, and an opportunity rather than a problem. I plant tender annuals into the opportunity as soon as I have chopped the poppies back. This year it was tithonias and cosmos. Inevitably, both sit without doing much for a while, but the light and space give them a chance to get growing rather than having to compete with other plants. Buying bedding is a good solution, but sowing some well ahead of time so that you have choice and control is the best solution of all. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> We have a wooden pergola with a lattice down one side (about 10 years old) which is covered by some gorgeous New Dawn roses. The rose, of course, twines through the lattice and around the pergola and the wood in the pergola is rotting. We would like to replace it with a more robust version, probably oak. But how do we replace it without having to severely prune the rose? I have attached a photo of the rose in full glory. <br><strong>Madeleine Haines</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Thanks for the picture Madeleine, and yes, you are right, it is lovely and it is swamped. But this is not a pergola question so much as a pruning one. You can't have both rose and pergola as they are, so the rose will have to be radically hacked back from the wooden support. The good news is that this will not damage it and, if two or three healthy young shoots can be salvaged at a reasonable length, then it should do it a lot of good, with it growing back in full flowering glory the following year. </p> <p>The secret is to never let the growing shoots wind themselves around the support. Instead, you must attach them to it so they are resting against it. Then they can be untied and gently lowered. </p> <p>There is also a pruning regime that allows you to annually correct and repair the trend towards entanglement. This should be done as soon as the rose finishes flowering - which in the case of New Dawn could be well into October. The idea is to take out some of the old wood each year, pruning it right down to the base of the plant, leaving behind a tracery of uncluttered straight stems attached to the outside of the archway. Reduce the lateral growth from these stems so that nothing is touching or crossing. Do this every year and the plant will remain controllable, as well as renewing itself completely every three or four years. On the other hand, you could let it froth and foam freely, just sniping off the bits that catch in your hair and accepting a total revamp every 10 years or so.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Our four-year-old rosemary bush suddenly and spontaneously passed away. It stood among other shrubs by a north-facing wall. Should we try again in the same place, or move to the south-facing fence, together with the more exotic shrubs? <br><strong>Richard Bateman, Walsall </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Rosemary is surprisingly hardy and will take winter frosts well below -10C, but it hates sitting in wet soil, especially in winter. Like all Mediterranean herbs, rosemary needs as much sun as you have to give it, and a north-facing wall is probably the worst possible place to put one. It also thrives in very poor, well-drained soil, so it can easily be killed with kindness. Start again in a sunny spot, adding lots of drainage (sharpsand, grit, even rough stones) and do not give it any compost, manure or fertiliser. Oh, and it's a plant, Richard. It did not 'pass away'. It died. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have a problem growing sweet peas. They grow tall but never produce many flowers, even though I pick them. What soil, feed and position are the best to get good results?<br><strong>Sally Roberts</strong></p> <p>Each year I raise sweet peas from seed and plant good little plants out in spring - and each year, after a first flush of lovely long-stemmed blooms, the second flush can only produce flowers on short stems of about 3in long. Am I starving them? <br><strong>Jan Church</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> First, Sally, do you pinch out the leader when they are a few inches tall? This is important, as it promotes side shoots - which bear the flowers - rather than strong upright growth. You might have to do this several times before planting out so you have a bushy, short plant that needs no support rather than a spindly, floppy affair. </p> <p>Sweet peas need rich, moisture-retentive soil so sow the seed in a good potting compost (I add some sieved garden compost, too) but do not over water until they have developed a leaf or two, and then never let them fully dry out. They like cool conditions, so semi-shade is ideal. I grow mine up wigwams of hazel bean sticks and before I make each support I dig a pit under the site and fill it with garden compost. This feeds the brutes and acts as a sponge to hold water for them. Having very rich soil and lots of water will make for bushier, healthier plants with lots more flowers. As for your short stems, Jan, this is because the first flower has had all the energy of the plant focused on to it. Professional growers pinch out all side branches and tendrils save for one, to try and get as long a stem as possible. For most of us, the shorter stems of the subsequent batch of flowers is a price worth paying for the extra blooms. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My front garden is full of English marigolds and now I would like some in my back garden, but garden centres seem to sell only French marigolds. How could I produce new plants from the seeds of my plants, and when is the best time to do this?<br><strong> Carol Mooney, Blackpool</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The English or 'pot' marigold is calendula and self-seeds prolifically, which is why, in your front garden, they have multiplied over the years. The easiest way of getting them into the back garden is either to collect seed from these in late summer, keep it in the fridge over winter and sow them in March, or move some seedlings next spring, while they are still small. Otherwise most seed companies will supply them from a garden centre or by mail order. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Which pot plants would you suggest for an urban balcony? It is southwest-facing on the second floor and susceptible to prevailing winds. A cantilever roof shields the balcony from rain, necessitating hand watering with (hard) tap water. <br><strong>Jo Langley, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It sounds as though you have an ideal position, facing southwest to get the afternoon and evening sun, sheltered from cold winds and with a cover to protect from the worst weather. Even warm wind is desiccating, so a screen would help - ideally a glass or Perspex one, so it does not block out too much light. A strong balcony can take an awful lot of pots of varying sizes. But it will mean daily watering or investing in a simple irrigation system. Actually, I think hand watering is good because it becomes part of your intimate acquaintance with the plants.</p> <p>Potting compost becomes a big issue on a balcony. Ideally it is water-retentive, nutritious, but also drains well and allows a healthy root run. Avoid any peat-based compost - I would recommend an organic soil-based potting compost or one based on crushed bark. And make sure that every pot has crocks or broken polystyrene at the base to help drainage - very few plants survive sitting in water. </p> <p>If you do not use peat - and I strongly urge you not to - then you will find it difficult to grow many ericaceous plants such as heathers, rhododendrons, camellias or pieris. However, most plants grow in most situations in most soils.</p> <p>I would go for a seasonal succession, starting with pots of snowdrops and crocus, perhaps with some daffodils coming through. Tulips look wonderful in pots. If possible I would have a number of smaller pots, each with a single variety. These can be left tucked away for the summer. Geraniums will do well, and you could have flowering shrubs of a hundred different types, from ribes to roses as well as topiary in box - which is very happy in pots - for green structure. A friend of mine successfully grew a wide range of veg on a balcony in Gray's Inn Road, including lettuce crops, runner beans, tomatoes and even potatoes, and I would certainly do this with growbags and a couple of large pots. Chillies and peppers are ideal for a sunny balcony, although have some fleece handy in case of cold late-summer nights. I'd also suggest some herbs - rosemary and thyme in one pot and some annuals like basil and parsley in another. </p> <p>Finally, whatever you grow, you'll need to supply some extra feed, and I suggest a weekly watering of a liquid seaweed solution. As for strength and regularity, the best advice is: weakly weekly.</p>",
  "Doctors are rebelling over plans that would lead to thousands of refugees being refused life-saving treatment for HIV on the National Health Service. <p>The Observer has learnt that specialists on a key health committee have refused to help draw up rules that would determine whether asylum seekers or other immigrants with the virus get antiretroviral drugs. </p> <p>One said: 'It is morally repugnant for us to have to look at someone's immigration status before giving them the treatment they need. Let's be clear about this: if they don't get the treatment, it's a death sentence.' </p> <p>The issue of how to care for refugees with HIV is growing increasingly controversial after the government introduced hospital guidelines last April aimed at cutting the number of patients receiving free drugs. </p> <p>Officials are preparing a fresh set of guidelines for GPs, which would stipulate that people whose asylum cases have been rejected, or who have not yet submitted an application to the Home Office, must not be given 'routine' care, including drugs therapy. Refugees are allowed emergency treatment only if they fall ill with Aids symptoms and are sent to casualty departments. </p> <p>The Observer has learnt that there have been several cases in the past three months of clinicians having to persuade hospital managers to allow them to treat pregnant women asylum seekers who have HIV. </p> <p>Under the April guidelines, hospitals can refuse to give women the treatment if the Home Office has refused them leave to remain in Britain. But a decision not to give them the drugs would leave their unborn children with a 30 per cent chance of developing the disease. </p> <p>Under government guidelines, people who are not eligible for full NHS treatment include illegal immigrants, students on courses lasting less than six months, those who have either not made an asylum or refugee application to the Home Office, or have had an application rejected. </p> <p>One hospital trust has already rejected a request from a pregnant African woman with HIV to have a Caesarean delivery, which would cut the chances of her baby being born with the virus. However, she found another hospital prepared to overlook the rules, and had the procedure. Her daughter was born without the infection. </p> <p>Doctors have told this newspaper that they know of several cases where such women have initially been turned down for antiretroviral treatment. </p> <p>Dr Andrew Pollard, a senior lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said: 'I am aware of cases here, where people have been prevented from treating the women, and then have been allowed to, after they have had discussions with managers and others, explaining what the risk is to the unborn child, and making the moral case for it. But the government guidelines are not to treat these mothers. </p> <p>'A child who has the infection will be sick and very ill, and that would cost the NHS a great deal anyway, so there's a big economic case for treating it. But doctors are morally obliged to help people regardless of the colour of their skin or their race.' </p> <p>A pregnant woman who is given the right drugs, told not to breastfeed and is allowed a Caesarean birth can expect the risk of the infection being transmitted to her baby to be less than 1 per cent, whereas in Africa it is around 30 per cent. </p> <p>In London, where 75 per cent of the refugees with HIV live, members of the local NHS Specialised Commissioning Group have also refused to draw up rules which would set out which illegal immigrants or asylum seekers should be excluded from care. </p> <p>A sub-committee, asked to look at the eligibility criteria, made its opposition clear but was told by health commissioners, the hospitals and primary care trusts which run NHS services, that they must do the work. </p> <p>One member of the sub-committee said: 'We said the plan is not workable because how are you going to turn away someone who is infected, who is likely to be seriously ill, and who remains highly infectious while he or she is not put on the right therapy? </p> <p>'This is an outrageous policy, and to me it seems racist and profoundly unethical.' </p> <p>A spokesman for the group, which investigates what services the NHS needs, said the issue was not about refusing patients access to drugs and treatment because of their asylum status, but about clarifying the guidelines. 'This issue is government policy, so people have to address it.' </p> <p>Dr Barry Peters, an honorary consultant and senior lecturer on HIV at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital in south London, said there was a growing danger that asylum seekers would not come forward for testing because they believed it would affect their immigration status. </p> <p>He is also worried about the guidelines. 'It seems ludicrous to wait until someone has a life-threatening illness before you treat them. These people are not a huge burden on the NHS, and it's odd that such a wealthy country as ours has over-reacted to this problem in such a way.' </p> <p>There were 7,000 new cases of HIV in the UK last year. It is estimated that there are around 17,000 people who have the disease but who have not yet been diagnosed. </p> <p>There are concerns about how fast it may be spreading within African communities in Britain, and also fears that the policy of dispersing immigrants may be fuelling the spread of the disease. </p> <p>The National Aids Trust will publish a report tomorrow identifying the government's failures to tackle effectively the increasing problems of HIV. It warns that unless the government acts quickly, HIV will continue to rise, resulting in many more thousands of cases each year. </p> <p>Its chief executive, Deborah Jack, said: 'We know that doctors are ignoring these guidelines over eligibility because they feel they are wrong, but we don't know for how much longer they will be able to do so. </p> <p>'For these people it is a death sentence if you end their treatment, and then deport them back to a country which has no Aids drugs. How can the UK try to do so much internationally, and then fail to deliver humane care in its own backyard?' </p> <p><b>'Every day I wake in despair'</b></p> <p>Angela, a mother of two from Tanzania who works as an office administrator, is HIV-positive and has been refused leave to stay in the UK. </p> <p>'Every day I wake up with this feeling of complete despair. It's hard to describe it to you because it's a mixture of sadness and fear. It lifts a bit during the day but comes back at night. </p> <p>'I left Tanzania five years ago when the politics of the time made it difficult for me to stay there. I lost everything when I moved and had to leave my children behind but they were able to follow me two years later. </p> <p>'I put in an immediate application for asylum but I didn't hear anything for years. I didn't know then that I was HIV-positive - I found that out two years later. By then I had got a job as an office administrator. </p> <p>'My doctor has been great, he found the right drugs for me and on them I've felt quite healthy. But now I feel very depressed and very unhappy. Honestly, my children have kept me alive, otherwise I'm sure I would have killed myself. </p> <p>'My children are now 13 and eight, and they go to the local school. We have a one-bedroomed flat above a shop, and there are only two beds so I sleep on the floor. </p> <p>'It really hurts me that people here think that asylum-seekers have an easy life, and take all the money in benefits. I've never claimed any benefits at all. I work as an office administrator and every penny I get goes into paying the bills and paying for the children's food. </p> <p>'Right now, I'm trying to block the future from my mind. Back in February, I had a meeting with the officials and the person from the Home Office who was very nice. But the others were not so kind. One person said, \"well, we've listened to your story\", as if it was just a story which I had made up. </p> <p>'Then I was turned down for the right to have leave to remain here, so now I'm appealing. Every time a letter comes through the door I have to run and get it first because I don't want my children opening it. They don't know I'm HIV, how could I tell them? They don't understand why we are here, why we have to share one room. It's really hard for them now.' </p> <p>'If I lose my appeal I might have to go back to Tanzania. Obviously, I would die there, because there are just no drugs for Aids. Just having a simple blood test there costs you lots of money. </p> <p>'I'm not a criminal and I don't want to take what is not mine. I'm in a full-time job and I pay tax and I want to carry on working. If people could just see that, maybe they would understand.'</p>"
