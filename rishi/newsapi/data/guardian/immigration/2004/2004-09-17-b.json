  "<p>Shell will this week make a desperate attempt to draw a line under the oil reserves scandal that has dogged the company since the start of the year by outlining its strategic plans for the future. </p> <p>But chairman Jeroen van der Veer and his exploration boss, Malcolm Brinded, will hold the critical briefing in the City on Wednesday with menacing storm clouds hanging over their heads. </p> <p>While Hurricane Ivan forced the Anglo-Dutch oil giant to shut down platforms in the Gulf of Mexico earlier this week, a verbal hurricane - emanating from its dismissed former chairman Sir Philip Watts - was blasting the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>Sir Philip is furious about the way in which he has been treated by the regulator, and by challenging its findings has once again ensured that the reserves issue will remain foremost in many people's minds. </p> <p>The demand for an appeal has also raised expectations that Sir Philip could challenge his removal from Shell - not good news for a company facing continued regulatory investigations as well as potentially costly legal cases from angry American shareholders. </p> <p>Despite all the trouble, the biggest issue for Shell in the eyes of most investors, however, remains the complicated structure of the dual-listed group. Its decentralised decision-making and confused hierarchy is seen as the main stumbling block to success. </p> <p>Fortunately, corporate governance is the one issue Mr van der Veer will legitimately be able to sidestep because he has repeatedly made clear there will be a separate briefing on this in November. </p> <p>But with so many other unresolved problems, Mr van der Veer will be dogged this week with as many questions about the past as the future. </p> <p>The last nine months have been tough for Shell not only because of damage to its reputation and the management upheaval, but also because it has been a period of relatively poor financial indicators, despite sky-high oil prices. </p> <p>Shell shares have beaten the UK market by 10% since the near-25% cut in reserves figures, but they have underperformed arch-rival BP by 4% and been left with a price to earnings discount of 13% to its competitor. </p> <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank argue Shell is also trailing the top five oil majors in return on capital employed, while yesterday Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein downgraded its recommendation on the company's shares. The average return on capital employed for the industry leaders is a shade under 20%, while Shell is struggling to produce 16.5%. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the group has been forced to increase its capital expenditure in the critical exploration and production division to boost output from existing fields. But some of this cash has been siphoned off to make up for unforeseen costs on the Sakhalin Island scheme in Russia and the offshore Bonga field in Nigeria. </p> <p>JJ Traynor, an analyst at Deutsche, says shareholder confidence will not improve while upstream project management continues to be \"poor\" at Shell - which used to pride itself on technical excellence. </p> <p>While the Anglo-Dutch group needs to catch up on reserve replacement upstream, it is also likely to see oil and gas output falling by up to 5% both this year and next. </p> <p>In refining and marketing, Shell has been through a period of heavy asset sales in an attempt to concentrate on higher performing businesses. </p> <p>About $10bn (\u00a35.6bn) worth of holdings have been thrown overboard already or are on the block for 2005. </p> <p>\"We are continuing our divestment programme to take advantage of good asset prices and recycle capital into higher value opportunities,\" it argued. </p> <p>But the disposal programme has also had the effect of highlighting some gaffes - the major discoveries in Rajasthan which have propelled Cairn Energy into the FTSE 100 index were found on acreage sold for a song by Shell. </p> <p>Rather than delight the City, the sales have raised fears that the company could go on a dangerous spending spree with the proceeds. </p> <p>The last time Shell became acquisitive it bought Enterprise Oil for what was deemed by sector analysts to be an unrealistic premium. Recently the biggest merger and acquisition story to be linked to the troubled oil major is whether it could become a bid target for others. </p> <p>BP and Total - both mentioned by analysts as potential predators for the company - have dismissed the idea either privately or publicly. </p> <p>The fact that this has been aired at all is a sign of how a once powerful empire has been brought to earth. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the City will be most interested in hearing how Shell's upstream portfolio is going to be restructured and reinvigorated in order to raise reserves and bring forward more production. </p> <p>But the chances are that the briefing will be a broad-brush affair that will be long on general principles but short on actual detail. </p> <p>The reality is that the mountain of legal and regulatory problems have taken up so much management time that Mr van der Veer and his team have spent the summer firefighting rather than surveying future strategy. Fortunately the City - it seems - has grown accustomed to Shell failing to live up to expectations. </p> <p>The chances are that the briefing this week will be something of a damp squib -but the stock market will be quite forgiving and its shares will not take a hammering. </p> <p>John Syropoulo, an oil analyst with HSBC, sums up the general sentiment towards the group - which seems to be driven more by compassion than frustration. </p> <p>He says of the forthcoming presentation: \"We are some way off getting clarity. I don't expect too much.\"</p>",
  "Bill Foggitt, who has died aged 91, inherited a family tradition of amateur weather forecasting and made its curious methods a byword as far away as Australia and Japan. Enthusiasts the world over tuned into his accounts of snail behaviour in Thirsk, the small Yorkshire town where he lived, or the unseasonal flowering of coltsfoot, which he used to predict patterns of rain and sunshine - with notable accuracy. <p>His slot on Yorkshire Television in the 1980s, Foggitt's Forecast, was respected regionally more than that of the Meteorological Office, and not just because its descriptions of moles and erratic sheep behaviour were more engaging than isobars. Before today's powerful weather computers, his enormous stock of lore was as reliable as the professional technology. </p> <p>The Foggitt family were best known for 200 years as chemists in Thirsk, where a little more discontent with their lot might have spurred them on to become the Boots of Yorkshire. In the event, successive generations became absorbed in forecasting, through a tradition of family diaries about the weather. </p> <p>This began in 1771, when part of the nearby town of Yarm was swept away in a freak flood, and Foggitt's great-great-great grandfather was intrigued. His interest was partly scientific, but his commercial blood was aroused by the notion that he might invent a lucrative system of predicting such natural disasters in the future. </p> <p>This was a vain hope, but from it came a family theory about cyclical weather that meteorologists consider respectable. Bill's great-great grandfather became a fellow of the Linnean Society, and developed a theoretical pattern of outstanding summers recurring every 22 years and severe winters every 15. </p> <p>The system was based on the sort of meticulous observation by unsung amateurs that has been one of the great strengths of British natural science. Foggitt, however, was anything but unsung. He had a winning way of describing encounters with moles and pine cones, or noting that seaweed at Robin Hood's Bay, on the Yorkshire coast, went slimy before rain - and, crucially, he lived to see a television era that delighted in such things. </p> <p>His media career started after he sent a letter to a national newspaper in 1946, suggesting that an unseasonal flock of waxwings in Thirsk portended a cold winter. It was printed alongside a picture of one of the birds; regional interest was sparked by follow-up correspondence to the Yorkshire Post, which initially asked him to write a column, then a regular item, the original Foggitt's Forecast. </p> <p>Foggitt's reputation was assured in late 1985, when he publicly disputed a Met Office prediction of a probable Arctic winter. Particularly interested in cold snaps - he always believed that a new \"little ice age\" was imminent - he described how he had seen a mole break surface through the snow, which meant that a thaw was about to begin. </p> <p>It did, and Foggitt was trailed by camera crews from across the world, while British Telecom installed a Foggitt's Forecast payline and researchers trekked to the North Riding to study his family methods. These became part of the geography national curriculum through the enthusiasm of Professor John Gilbert of Reading University, who recognised the rationale behind Foggitt's sometimes quirky-sounding practices. </p> <p>Foggitt turned to nature, and the pile of family diaries, after personal disappointment in his private life and work. He had been keen to become a Methodist minister, but failed the oral examination, and then flunked an attempt to enter the Anglican ministry, through Lampeter College, in Wales. He tried teaching in south Yorkshire and Stoke-on-Trent, but this, too, was unsuccessful. His marriage to Winifred, a vicar's daughter from Stoke, effectively ended after four years. </p> <p>Foggitt was then knocked down by a car outside his home, and almost lost a leg. In the depths of depression, he was convalescing at home when his mother suggested taking on the family's weather mantle. So began a long and serene career of natural history excursions, letters, columns and broadcasts - and many hours in his local, the Three Tuns, with a group of pub philosophers known in Thirsk as the Magic Circle. </p> <p>In recent years, Foggitt's star faded, partly because such a long exposure as a seer in a notoriously unpredictable field led to mistakes. Although he beat Michael Fish in a national forecasting competition, he misread the summer of 1993. He also had to endure the downside of fame, such as spiteful letters from readers and viewers who had been promised sunshine but ended up with almost 40 consecutive days of rain. </p> <p>Foggitt and his wife shared strong Christian principles, and never divorced; four years ago, he attended her funeral. They had no children. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> William Foggitt, weather forecaster, born June 11 1913; died September 13 2004</p>",
  "Some call it South Africa's Siberia, a dumping ground for the unwanted, but those condemned to live in Pomfret lament that some of them were wanted - as warriors. <p>Marooned on the dust-blown fringe of the Kalahari desert in South Africa's Northern Province, Pomfret is a village of 3,000 outcasts eking out existence in cracked houses with no running water.</p> <p>Two decades ago they lived in Angola where the apartheid regime enlisted the men into a black foreign legion, 32 Battalion, to fight against liberation movements in Namibia and their native Angola.</p> <p>They lost the wars and moved to South Africa but here too a liberation movement took power. It allowed the Angolan soldiers and their families to stay at their former army base in Pomfret but regarded them as race traitors.</p> <p>Stranded on an asbestos-poisoned wasteland 100 miles from the nearest town, this was the price of fighting for the white man.</p> <p>Earlier this year former members of 32 Battalion repeated that folly for a Briton - and his backers - whose lifestyles are at the opposite end of the wealth spectrum. This time they took orders not from Afrikaner generals but from a British mercenary, Simon Mann, who allegedly dangled a monthly pay cheque of \u00a34,200, a fortune here.</p> <p>Now the village is counting the cost of accepting his offer in absent husbands and fathers. The same court in Zimbabwe which last week jailed Mann for seven years jailed his foot soldiers for 12 months.</p> <p>For relatives it was a disaster: while their men languish in Harare's fetid Chikurubi prison they will struggle for food, clothes and medicine.</p> <p>\"We are all suffering. We have nothing to pay for anything,\" wept Bibiana Tchimuichi, whose husband Eduardo was one of dozens of Angolans who formed the bulk of the 67 men jailed with Mann.</p> <p>Before leaving for school, her son Pita, 14, showed a picture of his father in apartheid-era uniform. \"Every day I miss him. It doesn't seem fair he's not around.\"</p> <p>The Angolans were arrested in March when a Boeing 727 chartered by Mann, an Old Etonian, landed at Harare to refuel and collect weapons. Though convicted only of immigration offences it is alleged the Angolans were on their way to the west African state of Equatorial Guinea to topple an oil-rich dictatorship for the benefit of Mann's alleged British backers, including Sir Mark Thatcher. </p> <p>\"It is a lie. My husband is not a mercenary. He is a security guard,\" said Lucia Baka, 40, whose husband Manuel quit a security job in Pretoria to follow Mann.</p> <p>Like other wives, she claimed the Angolans were told they would guard mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a lucrative, legitimate, low-risk job. Under interrogation in Zimbabwe their husbands have stuck to that story.</p> <p>Analysts wonder whether the Angolans really believed that was their job but Mrs Baka insisted they would not have boarded the plane knowing the real mission was to depose President Teodoro Obiang and install a ruler who would enrich the coup plotters.</p> <p>Whether naive dupes or complicit mercenaries, there is no doubting the gulf between the foot soldiers' personal circumstances and the plot's alleged investors.</p> <p>Ely Calil is a Lebanese millionaire with a mansion in Chelsea. Greg Wales, Lord Archer, David Tremain and Sir Mark are all wealthy businessmen who, it is claimed, hoped to become richer. All deny links to the coup.</p> <p>None are known to have visited Pomfret, a sprawl of brick bungalows with broken windows, patchy electricity, no flushing toilets and soil too sandy to grow anything but a few vegetables.</p> <p><b> Asbestos danger</b><br> </p> <p>A former asbestos mine, the site was not rehabilitated. \"Don't stay a minute longer than you must. It's dangerous here,\" said a municipal worker.</p> <p>Some former 32 Battalion members who could speak English found security work in cities, boosting family incomes otherwise entirely dependent on pensions and social grants.</p> <p>Now that lifeline has been cut, said relatives, because of the coup plotters' greed. They relished Sir Mark's upcoming trial in Cape Town on coup-related charges which could put him behind bars for 15 years.</p> <p>The ire of Cristina Fernando, 38, was directed at Mann, who she claimed duped her husband Augusto: \"He lied to us.\" At least nine families in Pomfret have men in Chikurubi.</p> <p>Lawyers for Mann said he sold his private plane to raise funds for his co-accused and that it is not his fault the money has been held up.</p> <p>But that did not appease Aida Tchimuichi, 20. She wanted the former SAS officer to serve more than seven years. \"He put my father at risk.\"</p> <p>The South African authorities have hinted that the Angolans could be charged under the Foreign Military Assistance Act when they return, the same charge facing Sir Mark.</p> <p>To be caught again on the wrong side of a white man's fight is a grim twist. Two decades ago they were lionised by apartheid generals for feats against leftwing guerrillas in Angola and Namibia.</p> <p>Enemies called them Os Terriveis, The Terrible Ones, and accused them of atrocities. In apartheid's last years they were granted South African citizenship but never received decent housing, jobs or training for civilian life.</p> <p>\"I have tremendous guilt because the promises made to them were broken,\" said the battalion's founding commander, Col Jan Breytenbach. \"The only thing they knew was fighting.\"</p> <p>For Joao Dos Santos, 46, home is a derelict clinic in Pomfret smelling of urine. Paralysed from the waist down, he had no chance of boarding a plane to Zimbabwe.</p> <p>\"I'm getting old in a wheelchair. There is no future for us. We can't go back to Angola and the South Africans accuse us of helping the whites.\"</p> <p>Mr Dos Santos comforts himself with historical revisionism. By resisting Soviet-backed forces in southern Africa, he said, 32 Battalion helped defeat communism and bring democracy to South Africa. \"It's like we built a house but we have to sleep outside.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Saturday September 18</strong> </p> <p><strong> Under Capricorn</strong> (Alfred Hitchcock, 1949) <br>1.35pm, BBC2 </p> <p>One of Hitchcock's early works, a romantic drama set in 1830s Sydney. Conceived especially for Ingrid Bergman, in her Gaslight guise, she is married to wealthy former convict Joseph Cotten, and intimidated and slowly poisoned by evil housekeeper Margaret Leighton. </p> <p><strong> Paint Your Wagon</strong> (Joshua Logan, 1969) <br>2.55pm, Five </p> <p>Musical western about the rise and fall of a mining town, where hard-hitting buddies Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood agree to share their woman (Jean Seberg). Some violence is done to Lerner and Loewe's songs - notably Clint's I Talk To The Trees - but there's a strong gold-rush plot and marvellous Marvin following his Wandrin' Star. </p> <p> <strong> Black Narcissus</strong> (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, 1947) <br>3.30pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Stay-at-home Powell recreated the Himalayas at Pinewood studios but there is no artifice in the telling of this decidedly odd tale. Deborah Kerr leads a group of nuns who are women on the verge of nervous breakdown in an Indian castle; they are beset by hysteria, sexual frustration and crumbling morale. Utterly captivating. </p> <p> <strong> Carry On Matron</strong> (Gerald Thomas, 1972) <br>4.35pm, C4 </p> <p>The Carry On team are back in hospital for the fourth time, and still managing to raise laughs with terminally ill jokes about bedpans, contraception and the eternal battle of wills between well-starched nursing staff and men in stripey pyjamas. </p> <p> <strong> James And The Giant Peach</strong> (Henry Selick, 1996) <br>5.45pm, Five </p> <p>It is a peach too, with Selick giving free rein to a typically macabre and marvellous Roald Dahl fantasy. It starts in \"real life\" with little James (Paul Terry) given a bag of something magic by old Pete Postlethwaite; soon he's tipped into an animated world - a weird mix of stop-motion and computer generated effects. Top class Disney. </p> <p> <strong> Along Came A Spider</strong> (Lee Tamahori, 2001) <br>9pm, C4 </p> <p>Morgan Freeman reprises his character from Kiss The Girls (and, bar the name, pretty much every role he's played since Seven) as detecto-shrink Alex Cross, on the trail of yet another psychopath who has kidnapped a senator's daughter. It's efficiently done, with Tamahori hitting all the requisite suspense buttons. But with Freeman exuding wisdom and dignity while pretty secret service agent Monica Potter looks on admiringly, you can't help feeling you've seen it all before. </p> <p> <strong> Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo</strong> (Mike Mitchell, 1999) <br>11.30pm, ITV1 </p> <p>This silly comedy about a fishtank cleaner turned ladies' escort makes the Farrelly brothers look subtle. Rob Schneider stars as Deuce, who looks after a gigolo's aquarium and Malibu flat while he's away: but a domestic disaster leaves him looking for quick cash. TJ the pimp (Eddie Griffin) hatch the answer: he should become a \"man-whore\". There are funny moments, but the succession of supposedly comic dates with women missing limbs, a woman with huge feet, a blind woman and a Tourette's sufferer are pretty dispiriting. </p> <p> <strong> Truly, Madly, Deeply</strong> (Anthony Minghella, 1991) <br>12.15am, C4 </p> <p>This was seen as the British version of Ghost, the 1990 Hollywood tale about a man returning after death to comfort his grieving girlfriend. Minghella's film is less sentimental, more emotionally true, and funnier. He's helped by fine acting - Juliet Stevenson as the bereaved Nina makes you feel her pain in all its choking, runny-nosed misery, while Alan Rickman does a very funny ghostly turn as Jamie, invading her flat with a bunch of fellow late-night ghouls. Tears and laughter, all at once: clever stuff. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday September 19</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Three Amigos</strong> (John Landis, 1986) <br>1.30pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Slapstick western spoof about a less-than-magnificent three. Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short play silent-screen cowboy stars who trot off happily to perform at a Mexican village and discover they have been hired to deal in lead rather than blanks - tackling Alfonso Arau and his fellow bandits. </p> <p> <strong> The Devil's Brigade</strong> (Andrew V McLaglen, 1968) <br>1.45pm, Five </p> <p>William Holden stars as a tough second world war officer welding a bunch of US army cooler kings and crack Canadian soldiers into an unconventional but supremely effective fighting force. We follow the selection, the gruelling training, and the rip-roaring battlefield action. Does this remind you of anything? Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen was a big hit the year before ...</p> <p> <strong> The Hot Rock</strong> (Peter Yates, 1972) <br>4.10pm, Five </p> <p>Inventive, funny, spoof-thriller with Robert Redford and George Segal as outlaw brothers-in-law. The two crooks steal a fabulous diamond from the Brooklyn Museum, mislay it, and cut comic capers trying to retrieve it. <strong> </strong> Yates paces the fast-moving thrills with precision. </p> <p> <strong> Dr Dolittle 2</strong> (Steve Carr, 2001) <br>6.20pm, Five </p> <p>Eddie Murphy returns as the vet who can talk to the animals. He and lawyer wife Kristen Wilson are fighting to save a wilderness area from developers, which mainly involves him becoming a sex counsellor for Archie, the nervous circus bear (voiced by Steve Zahn). Murphy's a lot funnier in the Nutty Professor films, but small children will enjoy it. </p> <p> <strong> Something To Talk About</strong> (Lasse Hallstrom, 1995) <br>8pm, Five </p> <p>A mellow, even anodyne, account of a woman's fight to assert herself. The woman is Julia Roberts, a mum and manager of the family's successful stables, and when she finds her husband, good ol' Dennis Quaid, has been cheating on her she heads home to parents Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands. There's a corny showjumping subplot and most of the sporadic fun comes from Kyra Sedgwick as Roberts' sparky sister. </p> <p> <strong> My Cousin Vinny</strong> (Jonathan Lynn, 1992) <br>10.35pm, C4 </p> <p>Undemanding courtroom comedy with Joe Pesci playing a more lovable rogue than his usual demon mobsters. He is Vinny, a novice New York lawyer riding to the rescue of cousin Ralph Macchio and his pal Mitchell Whitfield, innocents charged with a liquor store murder down in steamy Alabama. Marisa Tomei won a best supporting actress Oscar as Pesci's snappy, argumentative girl. </p> <p> <strong> Monday September 20</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Patriot</strong> (Roland Emmerich, 2000) <br>9pm, Five </p> <p>Here's Mel \"Braveheart\" Gibson taking on the evil English again; this time he's a hero of the French and Indian wars trying to live peacefully in South Carolina in 1776 but dragged into the struggle for independence after his son (Heath Ledger) enlists. Some awesome battles, but it's at heart a simplistic stars and stripes-waver. </p> <p> <strong> Last Resort</strong> (Pawel Pawlikowski, 2000) <br>11.20pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Director Pawlikowski's documentary background shows through in this finely observed tale about the plight of a Russian asylum-seeker in Britain: it's a fictional case, but feels entirely authentic. Dina Korzun's Tanya and her son Artyom (Artyom Strelnikov) arrive at Stansted airport from Moscow and are whisked off to a seaside resort called Stonehaven to live on vouchers and be abused by officials and internet pornographers alike. An angry, compelling and touching film. </p> <p> <strong> Evita</strong> (Alan Parker, 1996) <br>12.20am, BBC1 </p> <p>If you discount the pounding monotony of the Lloyd Webber/ Rice songs then this life of Eva Peron as rock-shlock opera has some magnificent touches. Madonna is a charismatic Evita, first lady of 1940s Argentina: sparky, passionate, committed, and a hell of a singer; Jonathan Pryce is impressive as her husband, the president, and Antonio Banderas an intriguing narrator. </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday September 21</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Stargate</strong> (Roland Emmerich, 1994) <br>10.45pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Like his Independence Day, Emmerich's Stargate is a story of plucky earthlings battling hostile aliens, with the accent on special effects rather than any guiding intelligence. James Spader is a slightly unworldly Egyptologist who opens a \"stargate\" into a distant galaxy, stepping through with Colonel Kurt Russell and his starship troopers. </p> <p> <strong> I Went Down</strong> (Paddy Breathnach, 1997) <br>11.20pm, BBC2 </p> <p>This lively adventure is set in an Ireland where the blarney rolls in waves over a traditional crime-thriller set-up. Brendan Geeson and Peter McDonald are sent by a Dublin gangster to hunt down the man who apparently stole 25 grand from him: it's a picaresque journey through glorious rural Ireland, packed with incident, funny and surprisingly moving. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday September 22</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Gift Horse</strong> (Compton Bennett, 1952) <br>1.25pm, C4 </p> <p>The gift horse is the Ballantrae, one of a batch of leaky old destroyers acquired by Britain at the start of the war. For Captain Trevor Howard, reinstated after court martial, it's a chance to prove himself, and the old tug doesn't let him down. </p> <p> <strong> The Wedding Singer</strong> (Frank Coraci, 1998) <br>7.25pm, BBC1 </p> <p>It's set in the 1980s, but Coraci's sweetly old-fashioned romantic comedy hails from a more distant past. Since the music on show offers the decade's finest - from Culture Club to Kajagoogoo - it's wise to stick with the plot and the engaging performances: Adam Sandler's wedding singer and Drew Barrymore's waitress, as a pair having to lose unworthy partners before finding each other. </p> <p> <strong> The Pelican Brief</strong> (Alan J Pakula, 1993) <br>9pm, Five </p> <p>Glossy, plot-heavy thriller. Downside is Julia Roberts, none too convincing as a brilliant law student whose conspiracy-theorising on the murders of top judges proves correct. Denzel Washington as the gutsy hack who is her only ally is much more credible. </p> <p> <strong> Final Destination</strong> (James Wong, 2000) <br>10.35pm, BBC1 </p> <p>This jolly, gory horror film pits a traditional bunch of teenagers against the ultimate serial slasher: the grim reaper himself. Devon Sawa plays 17-year-old Alex, who along with his high school chums misses the flight to Paris. When the plane explodes, they think they've cheated death, but it seems it's Death who feels cheated, and comes to collect them. </p> <p> <strong> My Son The Fanatic</strong> (Udayan Prasad, 1997) <br>11.20pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Scripted by Hanif Kureishi from his own story, this is a touching and insightful account of a Pakistani cab-driver struggling for acceptance in northern England. Om Puri is pretty wonderful as Parvez, his ambitions bringing him into conflict with his fundamentalist teenage son. Politically astute and intelligent. </p> <p> <strong> Thursday September 23</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Perfect Friday</strong> (Peter Hall, 1970) <br>12.20am, BBC1 </p> <p>A light and sexy caper movie. It stars Stanley Baker in a worm-that-turns role as a dull bank clerk who hatches a daring plan to rob his own bank, with sexy Ursula Andress and her languid aristocratic hubby David Warner for accomplices. Neat, efficient and stylish. </p> <p> <strong> Friday September 24</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Robin And Marian</strong> (Richard Lester, 1976) <br>1.15pm, C4 </p> <p>Lester, maker of the chevaliers-rampant Three Musketeers and Four Musketeers, is in more wistful, elegiac mood in this account of the Robin Hood legend. Sean Connery's weary Robin returns from the crusades to confront Robert Shaw's sheriff of Nottingham once more, but despite their heroic final duel, it's Connery's scenes with Audrey Hepburn as a middle-aged Marion that make the magic; Nicol Williamson, too, is a touchingly faithful Little John. </p> <p> <strong> The Grissom Gang</strong> (Robert Aldrich, 1971) <br>1.05am, BBC1 </p> <p>Gruelling thriller about a young heiress kidnapped by a violent, amoral gang in Kansas City, 1931. Kim Darby is the unfortunate woman - though there are no innocents in this cynical tale - while Irene Dailey's Ma Grissom leads the gang, with psychotic son Scott Wilson. A remake of a poor British version of James Hadley Chase's No Orchids For Miss Blandish, it was attacked as debased and depraved by the critics.</p>",
  "<p>Often a source of great sense, it was Noel Gallagher who put his finger on the dilemma of the modern recording artist. Because you're not yet famous, the guitarist once remarked, you have about 10 years to write your debut album. Then you get famous and suddenly have about six months to write the follow-up. </p> <p>Small wonder, then, that musicians continue to turn to what is immediately around them as a source of inspiration. The only thing is, since they last looked, those surroundings have completely changed. No longer the streets they grew up in, they're now on tour, and involved in the strange mixture of exhilaration and extreme boredom that being a rock star seems to entail. And, of course, they write about that. </p> <p>Some, such as Blur or Stereophonics, manage to contain the urge to write songs about the music business until their third or fourth album. Others, such as Natasha Bedingfield or the Libertines, start pretty much straight away. In a new Babyshambles song, Gang Of Gin, Pete Doherty complains: \"In this industry of fools/Musclemen and ghouls/If you're not a puppet or a muppet/Then you might as well call it a day.\" A percentage of hip-hop is given over to this subject exclusively. Pop stars like Bryan McFadden (see his No 1 for details) and Darren Hayes are not immune. Maddeningly obscure or surprisingly specific, these are songs of dislocation and considerable self-involvement, certainly. But some of them are just plain excellent, too ...</p> <p><strong> Touring</strong> </p> <p><strong> Mot\u00f6rhead We Are The Road Crew, 1980</strong> <br>Alongside its all-conquering title track, the Ace Of Spades album additionally offered this: a salute to the band's army of key-dangling amplifier shunters. Even by Mot\u00f6rhead standards a thundering piece, the relentlessness of the music here imitates the pace of a life spent charging between European countries learning the phrase for \"another exceptionally strong beer, please\" in different languages. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"Another drink completely blind/Another hotel I can't find.\" <br><strong> Loudon Wainwright III Motel Blues, 1971</strong> <br>Melodically pretty for sure, the way Motel Blues handles the predicament of being a priapic minor singer-songwriter on tour is just beautiful. An unequivocal plea for sex, the song contrasts the suppositions of the situation - that the singer is notionally famous and therefore glamorous - and the realities of his shabby lodging. Styrofoam ice bucket. Scowling desk clerk. Not even anything on TV. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"I don't need to make no late night, New York calls/Don't want to look at those ugly grass mat walls ...\" </p> <p><strong> Pavement Range Life, 1994</strong> <br>Their transition from jerky Fall copyists to loose-limbed country rockers complete, this beautifully unfolding song proved to be the summit of Pavement's achievements. An evocation of flaky twentysomething innocence (\"Out on my skateboard/The night is just humming ...\") it juxtaposes this blissful state with the Zeppelinesque egos then to be found on the US rock package tour. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins ... I don't really understand what they mean/Couldn't really give a fuck ...\" </p> <p><strong> AC/DC It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock'n'Roll), 1975</strong> <br>A litany of the drawbacks of rock'n'roll, from the otherwise staunch Australians. Rock'n'roll is portrayed as a dangerous place, rather like, say, Ipswich town centre. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"Getting robbed/Getting stoned/Getting beat up/Getting boned.\" </p> <p><strong> The Record Company </strong></p> <p><strong>Pink Floyd Have A Cigar, 1975</strong> <br>Sung by British folkie Roy Harper, Have A Cigar gives voice to a powerful but clueless record company bigwig, and brought to the otherwise ghostly Wish You Were Here album its first palpable villain. Prompted by the financial realities of Floyd's recent entry into the big league, this provides a neat counterpoint to the themes of human frailty found elsewhere on the album. Of course, it falls short of saying, \"These sort of people drove our friend Syd mad.\" But not by much. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"We'll be riding the gravy train ... \" </p> <p><strong> The Smiths Paint A Vulgar Picture, 1987</strong> <br>The final Smiths album found Morrissey luxuriating in the idiom of record company promotion. Soundchecks, whether records \"recoup\" or not, even Smiths manager Geoff Travis's remark \"you just haven't earned it yet, baby\" all adorn this clever, if mannered tale of fan worship. Tacky badges or no, stars are still to be idolised, it concludes. The lethargic mood of the composition, however, suggests this was a band no longer with the heart to be admired itself. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"BPI, MTV, BBC, please them, please them ...\" </p> <p><strong> The Sex Pistols EMI, 1977</strong> <br>Their infamous TV appearance with Bill Grundy made the Sex Pistols notorious overnight. EMI, however, was less than pleased, and eventually severed their contract. Essentially, the group came out of it \u00a330,000 richer. To Johnny Rotten, however, the episode smacked of betrayal. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"Tell you it was all a frame/ They only did it because of fame ...\" </p> <p><strong> Musicians </strong></p> <p><strong>Half Man Half Biscuit 4AD 3D CD, 1993</strong> <br>Ever disposed to make cultural minutiae their subject, though HMHB's target here is probably of restricted interest (the 4AD label was the home of the Cocteau Twins; a 3D CD the kind of ludicrous packaging dreamt up by its artistic director Vaughan Oliver) this genius sing-along also lights on more populist targets. Misplaced arrogance. That old standby, students. And by implication, the very leftfield musical activity their own group is involved in. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"Playing eerie madrigals/On the campus egg slicer/I'm an all-out icon ...\" </p> <p><strong> The Kinks Session Man, 1967</strong> <br>A neat encapsulation of the 1960s phenomenon: inept beat groups employ services of \"session men\" (Jimmy Page, or in the Kinks' case, Nicky Hopkins), so their records don't sound like Billy Childish's. Wryly, Ray Davies ponders the moral state of these guns for hire. <br><strong> Key line: </strong> \"He's a session man/Pop musician/Chord progression.\" </p> <p><strong> Fans and Fame </strong></p> <p><strong>The Beatles Glass Onion, 1968</strong> <br>They'd done it before and would do again, but for a while Glass Onion was the Beatles' most self-referential, music business song. Namedropping their own material, the song was their sarky response to those who would look for hidden meanings in any Beatles statement, inviting them to indulge in a practice which was for an already tired group really testing their patience. Peer into Lennon's glass onion, you'll find nothing very helpful at all. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"Here's a bit of news for you all/The walrus was Paul.\" </p> <p><strong> Eminem Stan, 2000</strong> <br>It's hard to find an Eminem song in the past few years that hasn't been about the music business. My Band is good. Stan, however, may be the best record Eminem will ever make: a tale of an obsessive fan, the lyrical skills displayed here remind one why Eminem might be worthy of obsessing over. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan/ I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam/I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man ...\" </p> <p><strong> The press </strong></p> <p><strong>The Headcoats (We Hate The Fucking) NME, 1993, 2000</strong> <br>Deerstalker-sporting garage rocker Billy Childish takes aim at the rock weekly.

Innocently suggesting how easy it would be for a wannabe to make it if they followed the Byrds' plan (\"Get yourself an electric guitar/ Take a little time and learn how to play\"), the group's irony is explicit in the fiendishly complicated bass figure around which the song is built, and the innovation of the arrangement. Not just anyone, they seem to be saying, can do this. And anyway, why would you want to? <br><strong> Key line: </strong> \"Sell your soul to the company/Who are waiting there/ To sell plastic wares.\" </p> <p><strong> Nirvana Serve The Servants, 1993</strong> It doesn't make his demise any less tragic, but it's worth noting that Kurt Cobain was capable of at least as much trenchant self-criticism as he was self-pity. The first song on the last Nirvana LP is a fantastic statement from a man on top of his game, obsessed with his position in context (another song title was Radio Friendly Unit Shifter), and reclaiming his rightful place. The devastating first couplet says it all. <br><strong> Key line:</strong> \"Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old.\"</p>",
  "<b>Education</b> <p>This year lies halfway between 2020 and 1988, when Kenneth Baker, the then education secretary, delivered a package of measures that continue to define the modern educational era. In schools alone, the Education Reform Act introduced the national curriculum and testing at seven, 11 and 14; handed control of budgets to headteachers; and invented grant-maintained schools and city technology colleges, the precursors of specialist schools and city academies. </p> <p>Sixteen years on, some of the act's roughest edges have been smoothed, but the educational landscape is more than merely Baker-lite. Since 1988 Whitehall has meddled virtually at will in the content of the curriculum, prescribing huge chunks of the daily school timetables of children across the country. On the other hand, headteachers have become the most influential lobby group in education, as successive Tory and Labour governments pass ever greater power - and responsibility - towards them and away from local councils. And specialist schools have become this government's preferred model for (it believes) raising standards and (it hopes) persuading into the state fold some of the stubborn 7% of parents who continue to send their children to private schools.</p> <p>Maybe somebody - perhaps Gordon Brown if he changes his address by one digit - will abandon specialist schools and the perverse logic of expecting big rural comprehensives to focus on a particular area. </p> <p>But how wide will the changes in education really be by 2020? Heads will still hold the purse strings and local education authorities will probably not even exist. The best guess is that something called, and reminiscent of, the national curriculum will still be in place. Possibly this will be confined to five- to 14-year-olds, especially if trends to greater specialisation and differentiation from 14 on continue. If the government can get a positive consensus on the proposals in Mike Tomlinson's final report, in October, on reform of education of 14- to 19-year-olds, that will become more likely. </p> <p>Fourteen will have replaced 16 as the watershed moment in secondary education, with many more students taking vocational courses. There will be new qualifications to replace GCSEs and A-levels, the exams hardly anyone fails. But students will also take fewer exams: the generation at university now have had the worst of that. But there are almost bound to be complaints in 2020 about the failure to deliver \"parity of esteem\" between work-related and academic learning. There is nothing to suggest industry will deliver the input and enthusiasm to really turn that around.</p> <p>Taking a wider view, it is likely that many children will be taught in classes of 50 or more, with teachers working in teams, with other teachers or groups of classroom assistants. No counter-revolution will be able to obliterate that trend. The status of the teaching profession will still be diminished and the government will not have been able to convince jobseekers that the classroom is the place for them. Most of the best graduates will continue to turn their backs on teaching, to the constant complaints of the (by then) single classroom teachers' union. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Will Woodward is the Guardian's education editor</p> <p><b>Transport</b></p> <p>As they power along eight-lane motorways in their Asian-built electric cars - set to cruise control, naturally - drivers in 2020 will have plenty of time to think about how they will pay their next road-charge bill. A monthly envelope totting up the cost of each car journey will be routine by the end of the next decade if the government's long-term transport plans are anything to go by.</p> <p>Satellite tracking technology will enable the authorities to monitor every car journey - how long it took, how far it was, how fast it was - to calculate a journey charge of up to \u00a31.30 a mile. Driving in many of Britain's cities will require a congestion charge; many motorway journeys will be punctuated by toll booths.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, wants to begin levying a price for road space. The Conservatives support the idea in principle. But without such a radical change, the future for motorists will be bleak. </p> <p>Wages, wanderlust and globalisation are fuelling a desire to travel. Professor Marcial Echenique of Cambridge University reckons that, by 2021, we will all clock up an extra 1,000 miles a year by road or rail - raising the prospect of rush hours lasting from 5am until midday. \"The congestion will extend, so there will be no period without congestion,\" Prof Echenique warned in a study published earlier this year.</p> <p>Maverick motoring groups who blow up speed cameras will have more to get militant by 2020. A government-funded initiative on trial at Leeds University is examining the possibility of cars having \"intelligent\" accelerators that resist when drivers try to break the speed limit. Traditional speed humps are likely to go in favour of advanced models, which will sink for slower vehicles but stiffen to impede speeders. Many commuter routes will have high-occupancy vehicle lanes for cars with at least two people on board. To help pay their five-figure annual tuition fees, students will be hiring themselves out as passengers.</p> <p>The alternatives to motoring are likely to suffer from familiar problems. Network Rail reckons that by 2015 it can bring punctuality on the railways up from 81% to 91.7%. Says Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics: \"There are some eternal verities about transport policy. One is the maladministration of the railways and the fact that they're forever teetering on the brink of some form of Beeching's axe.\"</p> <p>On the bright side, both east and west coast mainlines ought to have been upgraded by 2020, with superior signalling allowing twice as many trains between London, the north of England and Scotland. But while tilting technology will be commonplace, there is little indication the money will be forthcoming to push speeds beyond the present maximum of 125mph.</p> <p>Commuters in the south-east will benefit from an upgrade to Thameslink and from high-speed local trains through Kent on the Channel tunnel rail link. The East London Line will be extended and joined to other suburban tracks to create an \"inner rail ring road\" around the capital. But only the most devoted optimists can confidently predict that Crossrail, the \u00a310bn east-west link across London, will be built by 2020.</p> <p>Britain's Victorian railway network will never be likely to match its German or Japanese rivals in speed and reliability for long-distance journeys. The disastrous \u00a37.5bn, decade-long struggle to model the west-coast mainline is likely to cast a shadow over rail policy for decades, deterring ambitious state schemes.</p> <p>Aviation could play a much bigger part in domestic transport. In a white paper on aviation last year, the government backed new runways at Stansted, Heathrow, Birmingham and Edinburgh. Government figures say the number of passengers using Britain's airports will leap from 189m to 460m by 2020.</p> <p>Heathrow will no longer be the world's busiest international airport, losing out through lack of space to Paris and Amsterdam. But journeys from Bournemouth to Newcastle or between London and Plymouth could well be on fast, cheap aircraft.</p> <p>Whether a Labour, Conservative or UK Independence party government is in power in 2020, the job of secretary of state for transport will still be a hiding to nothing. The challenges of congestion and pollution will persist. Travellers are likely to have more choice in how they get from A to B and their journeys will probably be safer. But whether moving around will be quicker, cheaper or more reliable than today is deeply doubtful.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrew Clark is the Guardian's transport correspondent</p> <p><b>Immigration</b></p> <p>Immigration will feature ever more strongly in daily politics as the 21st century unfolds. In Britain immigration will be seen as an essential component of economic growth and a prerequisite for a healthy economy. But this will not happen in the same way as in the US and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries, when they built multicultural societies on a positive historical legacy of integrating waves of migrants through the common goal of citizenship.</p> <p>Instead, by 2020 British immigration policy will be founded on the fact of our ageing society. Britain will have fewer people of working age trying to support a growing number of retired people. Britain is likely to encourage immigration on a scale that current levels only hint at, but in the process there is a danger we will develop a two-tier workforce that has more in common with the gastarbeiter economy of the old West Germany than on any American melting pot example.</p> <p>The basis for that prediction lies in the United Nations report Replacement Migration, published in 2000. It estimated that Britain needs to attract a million people a year between now and 2050 to maintain the balance between the workforce and the retired population. That might be regarded as unduly pessimistic, but even the most recent figures from the government actuary suggest that by 2020 there will be 20% more older people than younger adults. </p> <p>The majority of people in their 60s and 70s will be healthy and active; they will demand ever more consumer items and the personal services that go with increased leisure time. There will also be a growing welfare sector to care for the ageing population. The retirement homes of Bournemouth and Eastbourne will become key models for economic regeneration projects across the country. Home Office studies predict this will mean an increase in low-paid, low-skilled jobs that may be difficult to fill from the existing labour force.</p> <p>The pattern is already beginning to emerge in the hospitality and catering industries, where low-wage jobs with little security are increasingly being filled by migrants. The government's role is to ensure they can come here legally and get paid the minimum wage. But for this strategy to succeed longer-term, British governments will have to have come to terms with the flourishing hidden economy of illegal migrants. Otherwise the two-tier workforce will be even more likely. </p> <p>That means that a way to \"regularise\" the position of illegal migrants already in Britain will have to be found. By 2020 it could become a regular feature of British life, with amnesties granted to illegal immigrants before each general election. And if you think that could not happen, look to the US. Earlier this year, President George Bush thought it politic to give three-year work permits and possible citizenship to up to eight million \"undocumented\" workers living mainly in New Mexico and Arizona. His \"compassionate conservative\" move was, of course, really an attempt to capture the increasingly powerful Hispanic vote. Migrants here could soon hold equivalent political power.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor</p> <p><b>Economy</b></p> <p>Forecasting the economy is a mug's game. Who in the aftermath of the three-day week in 1974 would have predicted that by 1990 Britain would be down to a handful of pits and that the National Union of Mineworkers would be shrivelled and beaten? Who in 1984 would have bet that the early brick-like mobile phones would become the fastest-spreading technology in history?</p> <p>On the big assumption that current trends continue, we should expect the UK to become even more dominated by the service sector, the City and the south-east. Europe's wealth is concentrated in a so-called golden banana that runs from northern Italy, through western Germany, eastern France and the Benelux countries and on across the Channel. While Europe's centre of gravity has moved eastward with enlargement, the plains of Lombardy, Bavaria, the Seine basin and the London diaspora will be the continent's unchallenged economic powerhouse for the next two decades at least. </p> <p>As far as the rest of the world is concerned, the big story will be the continued emergence of the three big developing countries - China, Brazil and India. In sheer size, rather than per capita incomes, these countries may soon rank behind only the US. Europe's demographics and its sluggish growth rate mean it will stay rich but be in relative economic decline.</p> <p>That's the easy bit. In reality, things will probably work out differently. The optimistic scenario is that the new wave of inventions over the past couple of decades has pushed the global economy to the cusp of a new golden age. All previous long upswings were based on technological change, and in this view the internet, the mapping of the human genome and robotics are to the coming boom what the car, the plane and the cinema were to the postwar golden age.</p> <p>The pessimistic view is that the future of the global economy is jeopardised by two big threats - one financial, the other environmental. Over the past decade, there has been a rise both in the number of financial crises and in the damage they have caused. With the US awash with personal debt, and running massive trade and budget deficits, the danger is that the next crisis will not be in a developing country like Argentina but at the very heart of the global economy.</p> <p>The other danger is that nobody has worked out what to do if and when the oil runs out. This is an issue that has been ducked by policy makers since the Yom Kippur war in 1973 brought to an end the long postwar boom. </p> <p>So there you have it. You can be an optimist and you can be a pessimist. Or, like me, you can be an optimistic pessimist: things look good in the long term, but there's plenty of choppy water to navigate first.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor</p>",
  "The haze of mid-July hangs over Happisburgh. A great fug of warmth smothers the tourists and motor cars flowing as sluggishly as treacle towards the coast in search of some brisk maritime air. They find it where wind whips off the North Sea, through the dunes, up Beach Road, and over the cricket field to dance among the branches in the churchyard. <p>Happisburgh is a village of some 850 people, sitting on the Norfolk coast, 40 miles north-east of Norwich. There is a pub, a post office, a primary school, and tentative claims to have housed Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Charles Dickens. There is even a resident ghost, who goes by the rather gruesome moniker of the Happisburgh Torso. Rising up out of the cluster of houses are St Mary's Church and, a little way out, a red-and-white-striped lighthouse, each gazing staunchly out over the sea: God and man levelling an ever watchful eye over the waves.</p> <p>In the case of Happisburgh that watch is increasingly necessary. For centuries the coast here has been steadily, silently eroding; the sedimentary rock that formed 12,000 years ago is proving no match for the might of the North Sea. In the past few years, the erosion has gathered pace and it is now moving six times faster than the experts had predicted - in just 15 years, 25 seafront homes have been lost and many more teeter on the edge. A 2001 report claimed the parish church might be likely to disappear within 20 years. By 2020, Happisburgh as we know it may very well not exist. The government has already written it off.</p> <p>It is a most forlorn tale, one exacerbated by bureaucracy, politics and the lack of hard cash. In 1958 wooden revetments were built along the beach in an effort to damp the force of the waves, reducing the rate of erosion to a mere couple of inches a year. When the revetments were worn away in the early 1990s, after 35 years of faithful service, the district council removed them and began to speak of a concrete sea wall. Funds, however, were not forthcoming. Since then, there have been no replacement revetments, and the council has grown quiet on the subject of the sea wall. Meanwhile the sea has continued to lick slowly but steadily away at the coast, like a child with an enormous lollipop.</p> <p>\"It is a little worrying for a village which holds the backdoor key to the Norfolk Broads,\" says Malcolm Kirby, a retired company director who moved to Happisburgh five and a half years ago and now runs the Coastal Concern Action Group. He says there are a number of reasons for Happisburgh's terrible problems with erosion: an offshore granite reef system, for one; the hulking great concrete sea walls further up the coast, for another; and the aggregate dredging off Great Yarmouth, where, in the 11 years between 1992 and 2002, over 114 million tonnes were dredged from the area, making a hole in the coastline's natural defence system. \"There's nothing natural about this 3km gap where Happisburgh sits,\" Kirby says. \"Man has interrupted the natural situation, so he has no choice but to continue that defence.\"</p> <p> Meanwhile, the sea rises stealthily, tip-toeing up the coast when our backs are turned, each year adding to the weight of water that is sweeping away the rocks upon which Happisburgh stands. Global warming brings the sea level up 3mm every 12 months, and the shifting of tectonic plates adds a further 2mm, to make a net rise of 5mm a year. \"It doesn't sound very much,\" says Kirby. \"But when you look at the North Sea, the vastness of it, you can't imagine how much water is contained in that 5mm rise. It's mind-bogglingly huge.\" </p> <p>The next homes to succumb to the waves will be the stately Edwardian houses on Beach Road. \"And they can't be insured for landslip or heave,\" Kirby sighs. As the sea sneaks closer, the houses will be demolished and the residents offered council accommodation, but there will be no government compensation. The village suffers in other ways, too: should the erosion continue at its current pace, tourism will inevitably decline, and \"those eight weeks of summer to put enough meat round the bone\" - as Kirby puts it - will grow thinner. </p> <p>It is a strange truth that as our metropolises grow ever more corpulent, our island's very seams seem to be fraying. Happisburgh's passing will not only be the death of a village, but the loss of a sweet kernel of British life. It is how we all like to think of the British seaside, a Betjeman poem writ large: it is doors left unlocked, ice cream wafers on the front and the soft, slow swish of the sea against the shore. This is how we remember it, and this is how we wish it preserved, as in aspic. But the cold truth is that when we go back, it may not be there. </p> <p>If one wished to speculate on the future of Happisburgh, one need only gaze out to sea, where the remains of most of the village of Eccles lie beneath the waves. Legend holds that the village was swallowed up by the sea during the 17th century: one storm saw the loss of more than 70 houses, and with them, 300 lives. Skeletons from the Eccles churchyard still wash up on the shore.</p> <p>In the cool, quiet north-eastern end of St Mary's churchyard, away from the chatter and whooping of the tourists on the front, lies a mound, said to be where 119 men from the first HMS Invincible are buried. The ship set out from Yarmouth in 1801 as part of the Copenhagen fleet, but floundered offshore, with the loss of 400 of the ship's 552 members of crew. One hundred and nineteen were washed up on the coast at Happisburgh. \"Those 119 sailors are now many metres closer to the coast than when they were buried,\" muses Kirby. \"Are we going to let the sea have them back?\"</p>",
  "Very soon, you will be able to buy British figs in your supermarket. Lines of palm trees will sway on the south coast. Devon and Cornwall will begin to resemble the Azores, with blankets of ferns and evergreen trees crowding the countryside. Migrating birds will stay in the country for longer. And the seasons will become even more blurred. <p>Unfortunately, pests will also be on the increase. The mosquitoes so common in the sticky climes of southern Europe will start to invade Britain, too; rats and cockroaches will proliferate as we become increasingly urban and temperatures rise enough for them to survive the relatively mild winters. </p> <p>Environmental futurology is an inexact science. But it is certain our climate is changing. The effects of this change over the next 16 years will be subtle. If the predictions are correct (and the Gulf Stream stays where it is), the trend towards wetter winters and hotter, drier summers will continue. Summer droughts will become more commonplace and some of the southern parts of England (particularly Essex) will be subject to frequent flooding. Indeed, some parts of the county at the mouth of the Thames will probably become uninhabitable - because the homes there will be uninsurable.</p> <p>While the physical landscape of Britain undergoes these changes, the country's flora and fauna will see a much more subtle, often unnoticeable, alteration. Look out of your window and you will probably see leaves turning red and golden well before the supposed start of autumn. Frogspawn, usually an indicator of the start of spring, has been spotted in ponds on the south coast of England before Christmas. And some flowers - snowdrops, for example - have started to bloom at the height of winter.</p> <p>Tim Sparks, an environmental scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Monks Wood in Cambridgeshire, says his studies in phenology - an intricate science that involves recording the exact times during a year that things happen in the natural world - show that the blurring between the beginnings and ends of the seasons will only get worse. \"We have some records going back to the 18th century - there's been a lot of phenological change, particularly in the last 20 to 30 years,\" he says. \"As a rough rule of thumb, we've seen spring events advance by some three weeks over the last 50 years. Between now and 2020, we may well see a similar advance in phenology if the country warms as predicted.\" The occasional sightings of snowdrops and frogspawn before the end of the year will become much more common.</p> <p>There is also evidence that trees are starting to break bud much earlier. Dr Simon Leather, an ecologist at Imperial College London, studies trees. \"I've seen big changes in timing of bud burst - when the leaves start to come out,\" he says. \"And that's a temperature effect.\" Sycamore and bird cherry trees are classic examples.</p> <p>These changes in the seasons are not just a scientific curiosity. Many animals rely on their sources of food - plants, for example - being ready to eat exactly when they are needed. At the start of spring when there are plenty of young around, for example.</p> <p>\"We're probably already going to see some evidence of a mismatch between different bits of the natural world working together,\" says Julian Hughes, the head of species conservation at the RSPB. \"You can imagine that if spring [bird] migrants start arriving from Africa earlier than they do at the moment, they would therefore arrive before quite a lot of the food does, in terms of emerging insects. Even for common things like blue tits and great tits, if the caterpillar hatches emerge at a different time from when the broods are hatching, then clearly it's going to have a problem. We might also be starting to see some evidence of that.\" </p> <p>The fractionally warmer weather will also ensure that new types of plant will thrive in Britain. \"You have to recognise that this is a country of gardeners, and what is more and more in fashion now is that we have exotic plants in the gardens,\" says Dr Johannes Vogel, the keeper of botany at the Natural History Museum. \"And more and more are going to escape and establish in the wild.\"</p> <p>Plants such as laurel - certainly not hardy enough to be a native of these shores - have already been identified as having established themselves from a gardener's seeds in the south-west of England. The last time laurel grew in Britain was literally in another age - well before the last ice age, in fact.</p> <p>\"We will get more and more of these non-hardy plants, the ones which hard winters would normally knock back,\" says Vogel. </p> <p>Rhododendron is growing wild in north Wales - one of many plants for which the conditions just keep getting better. \"There's undoubtedly going to be other species which are not quite in their optimal climate at the moment, but if you raise it by a few degrees in the summer and make the winters milder, then they might be and they may take off,\" says Sparks. Palm trees already manage to survive on the south coast of England and it is only a matter of time before they, too, are thriving further north.</p> <p>The warm weather will not just affect the \"exotic\" plants introduced by gardeners. \"At the moment about 31% of people cut their grass in the winter in the south-west of Britain and 8% in Scotland. The numbers in both are likely to increase - many more people are likely to be cutting the grass in winter because it will continue to grow,\" says Sparks. </p> <p>If climate change will have the biggest effect on our changing wildlife, what we do with the land will also have an impact. Plans to build thousands of houses, for example, are sure to change the shape of the countryside. \"We're going to see a lot more concrete and asphalt in the south, which is going to have major impacts on a lot of wildlife,\" says Leather. And increased urbanisation will mean cities exert a stronger \"heat island\" effect. London is a few degrees warmer than its surroundings, for example, and the bigger it grows, the greater the effect of the heat island. In some German cities, warmer conditions have led to the establishment of termite colonies. Devon has already had these unwelcome visitors and it could be London next. Anyone in buildings with structural timbers should watch out. </p> <p>More houses also means more household waste. \"We're going to get more flies around,\" says Leather. \"We're going to get the sorts of things that are associated with sticky climates - we have mosquitoes but what we may get are some of the mosquitoes that can transmit some of the nasty things.\" In short, that could mean malaria (see panel).</p> <p>But there is good news. The increased flooding due in the south of England thanks to climate change has the potential to cause the birth of new wetlands and marshlands. The government is currently scratching its head on what to do about people living in the flood plains (the options include moving them out or installing flood barriers). If it decides to allow the waters to run and move the people out, wildlife will benefit. Then, says Vogel, we will once more have extensive river ecosystems. \"If you let the rivers meander and don't stem them and don't try to protect houses from flooding, you will get superb wildlife areas.\"</p> <p>Historically, farming has been one of the great drivers of countryside change, and that will continue. \"The focus of agriculture since the war has been to maximise productivity,\" says Dr Matthew Thomas, an agricultural ecologist at Imperial College. \"One of the changes that's happening in farming at the moment is an increased awareness of managing the landscape, not just for goals of productivity but to see how one can balance productivity with benefits for wider society and the environment.\" </p> <p>One big contributor to that process currently is reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). \"What this means is that farmers won't get subsidised for production per se - subsidies will be on the basis of production based on market forces,\" says Professor Richard Ellis, the head of the school of agricultural policy and development at Reading University. </p> <p>\"You could see changes in the incentives to grow certain crops,\" adds Thomas. \"You could see a shift to new energy crops, for instance, or fibre crops or pharmaceutical crops. Very large, uniformly managed environments or landscapes can be maintained relatively profitably. Smaller, individual farmers might find it more difficult to respond to some of these changes.\" Some land will simply drop out of production. The hills of Wales, the Pennines and Scotland, for example, are already difficult to eke a living from. After CAP reform the farmers who work them may be forced to give up. </p> <p>And how will the changes in farming affect our wildlife? \"The extent to which those are going to impact on individual species is, in many cases, rather unclear,\" says Thomas. \"Many species of invertebrate have scope and capacity to shift their ranges and shift with the changing landscape and changes in land use.\" How we perceive our countryside will also affect how we allow it to change. \"There could be considerable pressure to maintain the classic patchwork landscape of hedgerows and fields and a few cows or sheep dotted around, because that's what society wants from the landscape and that's what it perceives as a healthy and vibrant landscape,\" says Thomas. </p> <p>But what people want from an aesthetic point of view may go against what is actually best for conservation. \"Coppice woodland is better on a rotational basis for biodiversity than a wood that's dying and hasn't been cut back for 70 to 80 years,\" says Ellis. \"But often mature woodland looks extremely attractive to people, even though it's dying.\"</p> <p>Will we have to adapt to a new idea of the British green and pleasant land, then? That really depends on how you define \"British\". \"Our perception of what flora and fauna we perceive as being British will change,\" concludes Vogel. \"Also, it will become much more difficult for 'experts' to recognise what is actually British.\" By experts, he means not only botanists and zoologists toiling in the country's universities and museums, but also the armies of amateur naturalists who spend their evenings and weekends scouring the country in search of rare birds, plants and insects.</p> <p>The country will still be populated by species of animal and plant. They may not be the species we want to protect; in fact, they are more likely to be the ones capable of adapting to more extreme conditions. The species we are already trying to save are liable to be more susceptible to the changes ahead. Summer droughts may have an adverse effect on some of the rarer butterflies, for example. Conversely, the milder winters may increase the number of pest species we get - rats would thrive simply because their winter survival rate will be better. \"There are always species that will succeed in any environment, but they will change and we may not necessarily like the ones we end up with,\" says Sparks.</p> <p>\"If you want to say that there is a need for us to protect what is British, then of course we are going to lose,\" cautions Vogel. \"If you want to say we want to maximise diversity, then we are on to a winner.\"</p> <p>Ellis points out that change is a natural part of the life of the British countryside. \"It's worth remembering that the landscape has gone through quite a lot of changes in the last 70 to 80 years,\" he says. \"Often when people are looking back, they're looking back to a small snapshot in history which is the one that they want - maybe the 1930s, when things were difficult for agriculture, whereas many non-farmers think of it as a golden time.\"</p> <p>The difference now, though, is the pace of the change. \"I don't think that we've ever seen changes at the sort of speed that we are experiencing and that we are predicted to experience in the next 20 to 50 years,\" adds Hughes.</p> <p>Here we get into politics. We can be fairly sure what will happen to our climate - and hence to our countryside - in the next 20 years because we know about the carbon that is already in the atmosphere. What happens after that is less certain and depends on what the governments of the world do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That matters because we can't know if we are making the right preparations for change if we do not know what changes are likely to happen. \"You can overspeculate and there is a risk that we make a whole load of decisions to change things now that actually prove to be the wrong thing,\" says Hughes.</p> <p>We are also hampered by our lack of knowledge about the present: we have records for only a fifth or so of the flora and fauna on these islands. \"There's still great uncertainty,\" says Sparks. \"While we probably know more about our wildlife than anywhere else in the world, we're still conscious of the lack of knowledge in some areas.\" That ignorance is unlikely improve in the immediate future. </p> <p>Vogel says getting to know more about the country's flora and fauna and creating a comprehensive inventory of wildlife is a major objective for scientists. \"For politicians, it might be more opportune to remain ignorant and say, 'Well, we didn't know.'\" A little bit of knowledge, he adds, might actually be a dangerous thing for politicians, because they would then be forced to address some of the concerns for the future that understanding the present would bring.</p> <p>Nevertheless, says Vogel, we need to know exactly what lives on these shores, and on this earth. \"For the long-term survival of humans with the creatures that share this planet, it is of very great importance.\"</p>",

Easy. I shall maroon myself not in the South Seas but on a large, beshrubbed traffic island on the A1. There, while juggernauts whizz by in the fast lane, I'll listen on my wind-up radio to the wind-up presenters on the Today programme, and sleep in a hammock fashioned from the truckers' discarded condoms, skilfully knotted together. As for food, I'll survive by foraging on road kill and the little salty bits in the corners of old crisp packets, while sucking precious moisture from jettisoned cartons of Um Bongo fruit drink, and spend my leisure hours hurling abuse at any passing motorcyclists, who will soon come to speak of the legend that is a latter-day Robinson Crusoe. </p> <p>The huge traffic island at Scotch Corner would suit me nicely, I thought to myself when I passed it recently. I had just fled from a pretentious dump off the A1 (I won't name it, but I simply couldn't get past its menu, which offered absurd dishes of the \"pan-fried ostrich on a bed of mangetout engrossed in a rich coulis of diesel oil surmounted by a Cumberland sausage with a noisette of sperm sabayon\" variety), and was circling the roundabout, wondering where to go instead, when suddenly inspiration struck. Three miles east (past St Michael and All Angels Middleton Tyas) lay the gastronomic Orbiston Parva of Moulton, which is home of one of Yorkshire's most reliable culinary treasures, the Black Bull Inn. </p> <p>Run by the mother-and-daughter team of Audrey and Sarah Pagendam, this old country pub has been serving excellent food since 1963, and I originally discovered it years ago by trusting to the only truly reliable restaurant guide there is: one's own nose. Loitering in the car park next to the kitchen's extractor fans (which never lie), I identified the odours of fresh and salubrious cooking, and a quick glance through the door revealed head chef Paul Grundy and his staff darting about efficiently in traditional whites. Surprisingly, the place makes little attempt to advertise itself, but then again, I suppose it doesn't need to. Because, while most restaurants have to search for their clientele, in the case of the Black Bull it's the discerning customers who do the seeking. </p> <p>Not having booked, I'd expected to dine in the first-come-first-served fish bar, where the local oysters and langoustines are invariably sublime, and the seafood plate a triumph. But luckily there was a spare table in the Conservatory, a light and airy section bedecked with early locomotive memorabilia and resembling the board room of Rhodesian Railways circa 1930. That train motif is carried to its logical conclusion in The Brighton Belle section, an original 1932 Pullman Carriage that serves as a dining car, but sadly goes nowhere at all. Rather like most of our present-day trains, in fact, except that here the mussels and crabs are on the plate, rather than on the surly railway stewardesses. </p> <p>Forty years ago, the Black Bull's five-courses-for-a-guinea suppers were quintessentially English, but nowadays its extensive three-course menu is shot through with French influences. My companion and I decided to go rich with the starters, then plain with the mains, so her lavish warm salad of foie gras, lobster, pancetta and chanterelles with pineau dressing was followed by a simple, succulent grilled lobster with seafood linguine, while my warm salad of squat lobster and bacon gave way to the unpretentious honesty of good old grilled Dover sole, served in its prime (did you know that sole has the best flavour a day or two after death?). And for those of us in the know, what better way to conclude dinner here than with their sublime Black Bull crunch, a classic brown-bread-and-raisin vanilla ice cream that's more addictive than heroin (though arguably not quite as slimming)? </p> <p>Over port, we discussed the only question that really matters when evaluating a restaurant: what makes you pleased to be here? The ambience is agreeably rural, the well-trained staff have no airs but plenty of graces, the clientele is grand but unaffected (everything from rugger buggers to elderly colonels with cataracts from Catterick), and although the wine cellar could do with a few more half bottles, it's pretty comprehensive and reasonably priced. But, above all, the Black Bull has escaped from the nervousness that afflicts so much British cooking, ignoring the silly fads, the PR hype and the kowtowing to Michelin that plagues more fashionable restaurants, and holding fast to the Anglo-French traditions that they've long excelled in. Eating here would certainly be a revelation for any foreigner whose only previous experience of our native culinary heritage has been an encounter with a \"full English breakfast\", that disgustingly fatty and indigestible meal that's only ever consumed in hotels, mostly by crapulent businessmen in plastic suits with halitosis that can bubble paint off a window sill at 50 paces.</p>",
  "Twenty minutes into launching the Liberal Democrat draft manifesto (\"Freedom, fairness, trust\") came the inevitable \"left or right?\" question from the press. If our faces fell, it was because the question has become so meaningless. <p>The terms left and right became fixed in the lexicon in an era when the great political debate centred internationally on the fight between communism and the market economies, and in Britain between a Labour party committed to state ownership and the Conservatives committed to privatisation. \"Left\" was shorthand for nationalisation, strikes, state spending and state controls - and \"fairness\" (usually termed \"equality\") even at the cost of enforced conformity. \"Right\" meant privatisation, cutting spending on schools and hospitals, traditional views on \"moral\" issues, law and order - and \"freedom\" (usually meaning the right to spend your cash) even at the cost of injustice. </p> <p>Liberals were derided as the \"soggy centre\" precisely because we wanted spending so that schools and hospitals were of high quality, but also smaller central government. We opposed much nationalisation, but supported tougher consumer protection and pro-competition policies. We championed freedom of the individual, but tempered by equal access to education and health and a safety net of social welfare for when things go wrong. We sought balance - and are now rarely criticised for it because just about everyone has recognised we were right. </p> <p>With the collapse of the state ownership model, the Labour party seeks to outflank the Conservatives on \"choice\". Meanwhile, no longer united to see off socialism, the Conservatives are split down the middle between social libertarians and family values moralists. Left and right still have emotive and negative meanings to many people, so these days our political opponents like to use them about the Liberal Democrats - and rarely about themselves. Would the prime minister declare he is leftwing? Or Michael Howard that he is proud to be a rightwinger? </p> <p>Liberal Democrats refuse to be pigeonholed into left or right. We believe that the 20th-century division into left and right failed because society needs both freedom and fairness. As LT Hobhouse and the New Liberals said a hundred years ago, \"the struggle for liberty... is the struggle for equality\". Basically, people can't be free if they don't have the chance of decent education, health, and freedom from the fear of poverty in sickness or old age. Today we'd add that there isn't much freedom in a decaying environment either. But we don't want state control or regimentation. The political debate has moved on. Especially on to that much older division, liberal or illiberal. </p> <p>Take this example. David Blunkett and David Davis would both leave asylum seekers destitute, want every citizen to carry an ID card and have supported the removal of the right to silence. Left and right, but equally illiberal. Liberal Democrats oppose these measures because we believe it is vital to protect the citizen from an over-mighty state. So the press label us leftwing. We say it's liberal. </p> <p>Then we propose measures to remove subsidies to big business and cut back central government and they say we have shifted to the right. But liberals have always championed small central government and the free market economy, to maximise individual and local choice. </p> <p>The draft manifesto we published this week is not left or right - but it is firmly liberal. Take two examples. The first of these is giving more power to people who use and work in public services. It's our view that schools and hospitals will deliver better results to citizens when they are locally accountable. </p> <p>We also think that improvements will come when professionals are freed from the central government interference that the Tories introduced and which Labour has multiplied. That does not fit anywhere in the left-right divide, but is thoroughly liberal. </p> <p>Take also the environment. Labour and the Conservatives have traditionally neglected it. Conservatives have aimed for minimal government involvement in the economy, to give business as free a rein as possible. Labour has sought to create jobs in the short term, with little regard to which jobs are most sustainable. The liberal approach is to use markets to persuade people to act in ways that are environmentally sustainable, particularly using the tax system to encourage green behaviour. All underpinned by a passionate commitment to the environment as a duty to future generations. That approach has been sadly lacking from left-right political debates, but it is a core aspect of liberalism. </p> <p>All of this poses great challenges for political commentators, who look for simplistic soundbites even more than politicians do. But go out of the Westminster bubble and people have moved on. They want to be treated as individuals, not classes. It is time politicians (and the press) had the same maturity. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Matthew Taylor MP is chairman of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:taylorm@parliament.uk\">taylorm@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The strange thing about New York fashion week is that the clothes on the catwalk are by far the least interesting thing about it. As a spectacle, it is fabulous, like a visit to a strange but beautiful world. (It even has its own language: a \"row pas\" is a faux pas in the seating arrangements.) The front row is utterly riveting. Led by Anna Wintour, who is flanked at all times by three bodyguards, their militaristic dedication to fashion perfection and forensic levels of grooming would make a Stepford Wife look like Kelly Osbourne. It is also a freak show of Atkins over-achievers: every time I come here, I think the editors can't possibly get any thinner, and every season they prove me wrong. And this being New York, there are proper celebrities in town to attend shows - Jack Nicholson, Jennifer Lopez - rather than the soap stars and Twit girls who fill the prime seats in London. Because of this, a never-ending media torrent of rumour, gossip and tabloid bitchiness ensures that the atmosphere verges on hysterical at all times. There is so much to look at. Until the lights go down, that is. </p> <p>The trouble with the clothes is that New York is obsessed with looking rich. Looking wealthy is way more important than looking stylish, or even looking sexy. Which makes for a lucrative fashion industry but terrifically dull, one-note and unsubtle designs. Unlike with the Parisian notion of chic, there is no sense here of wanting to look a little mysterious, a little intriguing. There is no Je ne sais quoi about a cropped mink jacket dyed turquoise: it says, loud and clear, \"I have so much money that I wear furs in summer, too.\" Michael Kors, the uptown girls' favourite designer, personified this obsession in an interview with fashion newspaper the Daily earlier this week: \"If you look like you have to dress for the weather, you look poor. A woman who wears sleeveless dresses and sandals in a snowstorm, you automatically think she's got a car and driver waiting nearby.\" </p> <p>Now, I would love to give Kors the benefit of the doubt and assume that he is joking but on the evidence of his show, I can't help thinking he's at least partly serious. Entitled \"Greek Chic\", the collection set its sights on the jet-set glamour of a millionaire's yacht, all dry-clean-only swimwear and serious jewels brought out of the safe for cocktails. But the tiger-striped kaftans, python-print bikinis, white jeans and black sunglasses were more Jackie Collins than Jackie Onassis. As the New York Times put it rather acidly the following morning, \"while the clothes looked very rich and glamorous, the view was somehow limited\". </p> <p>Ralph Lauren has, if such a thing is possible, an even narrower world view than Kors, although he is too smooth a businessman to crack jokes about it in interviews. His collection of marabou-trimmed pale satin evening dresses, stiff white organza blouses and glossy pink sash bows were unimpeachably pretty but looked oddly like the wardrobe of a pampered Park Avenue seven-year-old who has grown six foot tall and borrowed mummy's pearl earrings. \"We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy,\" sang Ella Fitzgerald on the soundtrack. You'd have to, really, because these were clothes fit only for a super-sanitised Disney-fied version of New York life. </p> <p>Narciso Rodriguez is the designer of choice for New York women who want everyone to know that they are rich, but have a teeny bit too much self-awareness to embrace the Kors look. This is pared-down luxury, with an emphasis on pale, fine fabrics and a narrow, streamlined silhouette, for the customer who is prepared to spend $500 on the ultimate jersey vest. Clothes, in other words, for the woman who has everything: this season, she'll doubtless be ordering the pale rose, high-waisted silk dress. </p> <p>Even the younger American designers seem entirely at home with the Monopoly approach to fashion. Behnaz Sarafpour ensured her uptown-girl clientele felt at home by setting her show in Tiffany &amp; Co on Fifth Avenue, and accessorising her super-feminine collection - gorgeous kimono print high-waisted dresses for day and fluid columns of metallic sequins for night - with diamond tiaras and sapphire chandelier earrings. Zac Posen, who is barely old enough to drink, has a clientele that includes the president's daughters, and Sean \"P Diddy\" Combs as a business partner. He said in an interview this week that he sees himself as \"building a luxury goods company\" - a quote that you cannot imagine any of his London peers, with their penchant for staging catwalk shows in chilly high-rise car parks, coming out with. This collection was sleeker and sexier than his previous designs, with elegant trousers and body-conscious shapes: a nod, perhaps, to Tom Ford, the Texan ex-Gucci designer and multi-millionaire. </p> <p>Three European designers in town this week proved that there is another way to be successful in New York. Ghost, showing here for the first time, seemed like an innocent abroad with their trademark refreshingly simple ice-cream colours and classic sundresses. Matthew Williamson also stuck to what he does best: a Sienna Miller-friendly, Ibiza-inspired wardrobe, with boho-chic smocked muslin and fluttery-hemmed rainbow prints, all worn with gold-weave goddess sandals. Roland Mouret brought a welcome touch of sophistication, with divine Jackie O collared skirt suits in soft metallics, cut just-so but in unusual fabrics so that they were proper but not prim. For evening, jersey dresses were wrapped and knotted across bare flesh to dramatic effect. </p> <p>But going against the grain can cause an uproar. The designer Bryan Bradley of Tuleh recently caused a mini-crisis on the Upper East Side by loudly distancing himself from the high-society image of his label. \"Bradley is not a Lady Who Lunches. He is a 38-year-old gay man who is frank about sex and drug use, smokes cigarettes, drinks a lot of Scotch and has an inherent dislike of bourgeois ideals,\" concluded an interviewer from Womenswear Daily. This collection, which eschewed twinsets and pastel shifts for lace dresses under rubber coats and a rude-word print, had a noticeably cooler reception than previous seasons. Luella Bartley is also at odds with the New York look. At first, her show seemed to suggest that she had gone native since moving to America: the first model wore a white polo shirt, pristine wide-legged trousers and a crocodile belt, as if she had stepped straight out of a Ralph Lauren advert. But before long, what Luella calls her \"classics\" began to appear: drainpipe jeans, biker jackets (this time cropped and pink) and blazers \"inspired by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Think 1970s Pacha.\" The New York Times was not convinced. Luella \"lacked any of a New Yorker's sense of polish,\" it sniffed. </p> <p>Diane von Furstenberg is adored by New York society despite her free and easy style - this season, lots of African textile prints and wild colour combinations - because she was born in Europe and used to be married to a prince. Marc Jacobs gets away with odd shapes and kooky combinations because le tout New York knows that without him, the city would have precious little in the way of new ideas to call its own. Calvin Klein and Donna Karan are both able to rise above the show-me-the-money look, by virtue of having built their empires at a time when it was fashionable to look as if you were powerful and busy, with interests beyond calories and lapdogs. This season, Klein (now designed by Francisco Costa) was a serenely beautiful succession of slim silhouettes in every shade from jade green to Masai orange. Donna Karan was rooted, too, in urban glamour of the Wall Street rather than Park Avenue type: the collection was dominated by every shade of grey, from palest silver to charcoal, pepped up with eye-poppingly lurid accessories. It is a strange day when Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, models of global capitalism, seem positively bohemian amid this coterie of unashamed flashness. Bring back the days when New York was all black Lycra and Filofaxes, for all is forgiven.</p>",

The 'geeky one' from the Chemical brothers? As opposed to what?\" says a bewildered Mark Hooper.</p> <p><strong>4.34pm:</strong> Latest scores: </p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (12) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 5 up Love/Campbell (11) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (10) <br> Garcia/Westwood 4 up Toms/Furyk (9)</p> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> Neither Woods nor Mickelson can make a birdie at the par-five fifth, which really should have been in their favour given its length, but Harrington can. Europe two up again.</p> <p>David Toms' putt for a half at the ninth travels all the way around the lip of the hole before deciding to be difficult and stay out. What a shame. No, really. Sergio taps in for his par and increases Europe's lead to four holes after the front nine.</p> <p>Duncan Cooper, our Swedish correspondent, says: \"\"Can I be the 30th person to point out that Elin Nordegren's mum is a Cabinet minister in Sweden?\" 'Fraid not, as you are in fact the first. \"She's Barnbro Holmberg, Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy.\"</p> <p><strong>4.26pm:</strong> Harrington matches Monty's approach shot, playing a terrific third at the par-five to a couple of feet from the pin.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Clarke and Jimenez are now five up after the Spaniard with the porn-star looks made yet another birdie. If this was a strokeplay event, Europe would have eight of the top 10 players. Then again, if this was an individual strokeplay event, the Americans probably wouldn't be playing with such mediocrity.</p> <p><strong>4.21pm:</strong> Big Phil has hit his drive at the 12th so far wide it's almost in one of the beer tents. Like Monty's earlier, maybe it was on purpose. His second hit a tree. Big Phil isn't having the best time. Monty, meanwhile, well Monty is just putting the other three in his group to shame. A majestic approach shot for the Scot leaves him with an almost certain birdie.</p> <p>Luke Donald has finally sunk a putt, and what an important one it was, saving the tenth hole. </p> <p>With regards to the US captain removing his cowboy hat, John McClure says: \"Sutton has obviously heard about Monty's 'playing better without my hat' theory.\" Yep, that'll be it.</p> <p><strong>4.13pm:</strong> Strange goings-on on the 11th green. Monty for some reason picked up his ball rather than putting and taking the pressure off Harrington. Padraig proceeded to miss his putt short, allowing Mickelson to tie the hole.</p> <p>Jimenez and Clarke have halved the tenth with Love and Campbell, and McGinley and Donald remain locked in a tight battle with Riley and Cink around the turn. </p> <p>Garcia and Westwood are now on the eighth green, and Sergio has a putt to win the hole after a great long shot froma farirway bunker... it hits the lip of the hole and fails to drop. Westwood has a little chuckle with his Spanish partner - the duo really have become bosom-buddies. Jim Furyk, he of the strange swing and the even stranger nose, hits his putt straight as an arrow to halve the hole with a par.</p> <p>Several of you have pointed out that the Davis Loves were indeed golfers, and I have appointed Catherine Brodigan as your spokeswoman: \"His dad was a golf teacher. Apparently there's also a Davis Love IV (heaven help us) who is now 11 and no doubt being groomed for Ryder Cup 2020.\" Crikey. Phil Swainston's idea is less likely but probably more entertaining: \"Maybe Davis Love Davis LoveII and Davis Love III are brothers of parents from some cybernetic research Co. and maybe they stopped at Davis Love IX.\" </p> <p><strong>4.06pm:</strong> Hal Sutton has had his first on-course interview. Having lost the cowboy hat (this is getting serious now, you know), Sutton accepted that the Europeans are simply playing brilliantly.</p> <p>Gareth Radford has some suspicions: \"Are Elin Nordegren and the geeky one from the Chemical Brothers the same person? Have they ever been seen in the same room together? I think we should be told.\" Anyone?</p> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Both Garcia and Furyk have seen long putts slip agonisingly past the hole on the seventh, which is duly halved. So far the Americans have only won four holes, and three of those have been in the top match.</p> <p>Monty has played his first bad shot, though it may, just may, have been intentional. It went carerring off the fairway towards the crowd, and towards one woman in particular... Elin Nordegren. The blonde beauty leapt from her position on the ground, as did her skirt, which was swiftly pulled back down to her knees. A message from the Scot to Woods if ever there was one. Harrington proceeds to knock his approach 10 feet short of the pin.</p> <p>Paul Hebert thinks he knows why Monty is playing so well, excusing the last shot: \"Monty's man breasts don't seem the slightest bit smaller, and as a scratch golfer with man breasts myself, Monty needs them big to keep his swing plane on line! That is why he is playing so well.\"</p> <p>Allan Knox has an alternative theory: \"For the past few years Monty has been contractually obliged to wear a visor/baseball cap whatever. Ever since he has done this, his strength on the tour have declined. Well, in the Ryder Cup he doesn't have to wear a hat.\" Ah, I see.</p> <p><strong>3.53pm:</strong> Latest scores:</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 1 up Mickelson/Woods (10) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 4 up Love/Campbell (9) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (8) <br> Garcia/Westwood 3 up Toms/Furyk (7)</p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Woods misses his putt for a par, and now Big Phil is going through his strange pre-putt routine of standing a long way from the hole and picturing a practice putt go in. But it seems to work, and so Europe remain just one up.</p> <p>Quadruple that scoreline in the second match, where Jimenez has just holed a close putt to extend Europe's lead. In the third match though, Europe's lead has evaporated, with neither Donald nor McGinley able to match Riley's birdie.</p> <p>Nick Temple writes: \"Do you know if Davis Love and Davis Love II were golfers too? And did they look like they were bullied at school?\" I wish I did know, Nick, but I don't. More than likely though.</p> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> Chris Riley has played a beautiful approach at the eighth and has only a gimme left. Either McGinley or Donald will have to hole to maintain their advantage. It's high time Donald did his part.</p> <p>On the tenth green, with Monty and Harrington only able to manage pars, Mickelson has a putt for the win... he aims it miles out to the right... it doesn't swing... it still doesn't swing... it passes the hole... and then it swings. Poor old Phil is made to look like a bit of a fool, and now both he and Tiger have tough putts for par.</p> <p>Pasha Bakhtia asks: \"Do you know if Phil is using the Nike ball during the four-ball or is he playing the Callaway?\" I'm afraid I don't Pasha, and I also don't know what make socks Davis Love is wearing.</p> <p><strong>3.37pm:</strong> Jim Furyk has made his team's first birdie. The pressure is now on Sergio to make his putt to halve... and he does. And then he does a rather funny hand jig with Westwood, similar to the one that Ryan Giggs and Paul Ince used to do when one of them scored for Manchester United.</p> <p>It's all going off. Darren Clarke now has a chance to win the eighth hole... but it dribbles past. Still, he and Jimenez are three up and Europe are up in all the games. Phew, this is exciting stuff. </p> <p><strong>3.31pm:</strong> The first real example of how tricky these greens can be. Monty, from a perilous position in the bunker, plays his shot supremely right next to the hole. It seemed to stop, but the US crowd must have all blown together, and it started rolling again until it was twenty feet from the pin. Monty can't make the putt, and neither can Harrington, so the US win the hole with a par. They are one down at the turn. </p> <p>Stewart Cink has made a birdie with a 25-footer. Until that point, Woods and Mickelson were the only Americans to have played a hole under par. But hold on, yer man Paul McGinley has made another sweeping putt, and they remain one up. </p> <p>\"I see Chris Riley is the self-styled US team joker,\" begins Jonathan Wood, somehwat sarcastically I suspect. \"Davis Love's example of his wackiness was when Chris tried to get as many people as possible in the hotel elevator. Crazy guy. Perhaps the Chuckle Brothers could launch a new career Stateside.\"</p> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> David Toms misses a short putt which would have clawed a hole back for he and Furyk. Westwood makes no mistake to square the hole.</p> <p>In the top match, three of the four players are in the bunker at the 220-yard ninth, with Woods' ball looking a little lonely near the hole.</p> <p>\"By the by, what do you do,if you are an Irishman working/living in Canada and decide to take Canadian citzenship thus being required to take an oath of allegiance to the Queen. Say it in Irish?\" I don't know, Niall O'Keeffe, this is all getting very complicated.</p> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> Latest scores:</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (8) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 3 up Love/Campbell (7) <br> McGinley/Donald 1 up Riley/Cink (6) <br> Garcia/Westwood 3 up Toms/Furyk (4)</p> <p><strong>3.18pm:</strong> Woods is first to putt... he misses. Misses by a long way too - that's certainly not dead. Harrington next... in it goes! A corker from 20 feet. Now Mickelson to halve from 15 feet... nope, it trickles past. Harrington wins the hole despite being in the worst position off the tee.</p> <p>Paul McGinley lands the first birdie in his match, Riley misses the chance to equal him, and Europe are now up in all four matches.</p> <p>\"I can't decide whether Mrs Mickleson looks like Monica Lewinsky or (more alarmingly) Phil himself,\" says Alex Webster. \"Either way, I reckon the European lasses have got to be in with a shout.\" So have the European men at this rate.</p> <p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> All four players in the top match are on the eighth green in two shots, but it's the Americans who will fancy themselves for their putts more. Or is that just fancy themselves more. </p> <p> \"In response to Barry O'Connell's jibe at Monty's chins, this may have been true at The Belfry but now he's obviously got rid of the man breasts to have a crack at Tiger's bird,\" explains Luke Burdess. \"The way Monty's playing he definitely has a chance... of winning his match.\"</p> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Westwood has a putt for a birdie on the fourth... and in it goes. He and Sergio have started where they left off at The Belfry, and are now three up. Over on the fifth, Chris Riley has made a steady putt for par, so the third match remains gridlocked at all square.</p> <p>Jimeneze and Campbell both have holeable birdie putts on the seventh green.</p> <p>\"That comment about Monty's chins obviously came from a very uneducated gentleman, as if he'd read The Guardian yesterday he would have noted that Monty has lost 38lbs over the last month and is at his lowest fighting weight for quite some time,\" says Ross Campbell. \"Besides there will be enough negative comments from the Yanks without us getting involved.\" Yeah, fair point, Ross, though the negative comments seem to be no skin off Monty's back. Though come to think of it, maybe that's the explanation for his weight loss.</p> <p><strong>2.59pm:</strong> A brave effort, but Monty couldn't quite hole his long putt. Europe give Mickelson his, the USA are back to one down. What a match this is proving to be - every hole has been won by a birdie. And big Phil has just swung his arm around Monty - what a top guy he is. If only he was European.</p> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Andrew Jackson wonders: \"With Clarke and Jimenez two up after four is there any sign of them sparking up the big habanas yet?\" Well, now that they're three up after five, there could be. Staying on the Jimenez theme, Kevin gannon has an apology: \"Ok, forget my earlier comments about Jimenez and his unique hair. I now bow down before the Divine Ponytail.\"\"</p> <p><strong>2.52pm:</strong> The third match is now all square after four holes, and the Europeans are two up after three in the fourth match after Sergio holed out from five feet for a nervy par.</p> <p>Mickelson has played a brilliant second to the seventh green and has a tap-in. Monty will have to hole from fifteen feet or Harrington chip in from the rough to halve.</p> <p>Ian Barry writes: \"I have translated God Save the Queen into Irish if anyone is interested!\" Suzy Byrne?</p> <p><strong>2.47pm:</strong> Latest scores:</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (6) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 3 up Love/Campbell (5) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (3) <br> Garcia/Westwood 2 up Toms/Furyk (2)</p> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> Jimenez is on fire. He's played another exceptional approach shot, this time to the fifth. He doesn't need to putt though as Clarke finds the hole from 25 feet. That's two birdies and an eagle for the Ulsterman. With Love missing his long birdie putt, Europe are three up.</p> <p>Over to the sixth green, on which all the players are struggling. Mickelson merely nudges his ball, but it still travels about thirty feet, about ten feet of which was past the hole. Monty's would have gone off the green if it hadn't gone in, but it did go in! Five birdies in six holes for Monty. Woods misses, and Europe are two up again.</p> <p> Warren Green observes: \"Just seen a picture of Clarke's barnet. Absolutely shocking. He looks like a fat Billy Idol.\" Quite. Oh, and I've just spilt my yoghurt all down me amid the excitement of it all.</p> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Clarke and Jimenez have snatched the fourth hole and are two up after the Americans fell to pieces on the green. Love is not proving the steady-eddie everyone thinks he is.</p> <p>And over on the second green, the glad tidings keep coming in for Europe. Westwood has nailed his ten-footer to put he and Garcia two up. </p> <p>Barry O'Connell has some advice for Harrington's partner after they lost the last hole: \"Keep your chins up, Monty.\"</p> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> Harrington and Monty have lost a hole, as neither could even make par. Woods and Mickelson both had excellent birdie opportunities, but neither was made to putt for the hole. </p> <p>Stewart Cink has missed a putt to putt his pairing one up on McGinley and Donald at the third. The European pair are yet to fire there. </p> <p>Rob Deeming asks: \"MCan you give an update, to those of us not near a TV, as to the status of Bernhard's mullet today? Pristine, one can only assume.\" it was in excellent condition at the start of play, but the breeze is getting up in Detroit to speeds of 25-30mph, and so not only affecting the play of the players, but also Bern-Hard (as Sutton called him repeatedly last night). The mullet is looking somewhat windswept.</p> <p><strong>2.22pm:</strong> Furyk missed his putt so Garcia and Westwood are one up after one. The duo were very successful at the Belfry two years ago, winning three of their four matches. With McGinley and Donald halving the second hole, Europe are now up in three of the matches and all square in the other. What a start. For those looking for a scoreboard: (number of holes played in brackets)</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (4) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 1 up Love/Campbell (3) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (2) <br> Garcia/Westwood 1 up Toms/Furyk (1)</p> <p><strong>2.16pm:</strong> Monty has sunk another birdie - that's three in four for him, and four in four for he and his partner. Mickelson missed his putt, so there was massive pressure on Woods, but the great man didn't let it show - he holes out to halve the hole. People will be critical of Woods and Mickelson if they don't win, but there's only so much you can do when the opposition is birdieing every hole.</p> <p>Sergio Garcia is off to a flyer with a birdie at the first. Furyk must now hole his 10-foot putt to keep their match all square. Less good news for Donald though. The rookie is looking a little nervy, and he has followed his poor first hole with three disappointing shots at the second. McGinley will have to work hard to keep them all square.</p> <p>Clarke and Jimenez are one up after the first three holes after the Ulsterman secured his eagle at the second.</p> <p><strong>2.06pm:</strong> Monty has had his first interaction with the crowd, demanding one intrusive spectator to keep still. Breathe, Monty, breathe. All four players are on the fourth green with birdie putts.</p> <p>The Americans are starting to hit back. Jim Furyk has played a fine approach to the first, and is in with the best chance of a birdie of his fourball. Chad Campbell, meanwhile, has hit his tee-shot at the third to within a few feet of the pin.</p> <p>Matthew Crudgington requests: \"Michael, can you talk about the state of the course, especially the greens and rough?\" I can indeed. They're in impeccable shape. The greens are, well, just that, while the fairways look like the greens we have over this side of the pond. The rough is also accommodating, hardly a hazard at all. The greens do look a tricky prospect, mind you, as Phil Mickelson's putt at the first demonstrated. His stroke was slightly underhit, and the ball did not quite make the top level, rolling back down the slope about fifteen to twenty feet.</p> <p> <strong>2pm:</strong> Woods misses his birdie putt, as does Mickelson. Harrington makes no mistake, though, firmly knocking his ball into the middle of the hole. Those cries of \"U S A\" are sounding a bit hollow now. The dream team of Mickelson and Woods is something of a nightmare at the moment, but there's a long way to go.</p> <p>Match three is all square after one hole with McGinley playing a beautiful chipped third shot to secure a four for Europe.</p> <p>Darren Clarke has played a great second shot at the second hole, and has a real chance for an eagle. With Chad Campbell missing his eagle putt, Clarke can win the hole here.</p> <p>\"Can you help my golfing friend Commander Jennifer Flather of the US Navy based in Washington DC?\" I'll do my best, Allan Knox. \"She needs a date, preferably a single golfing male who has his own tuxedo? I suggested Monty, but has anyone got any better suggestions?\"</p> <p><strong>1.54pm:</strong> Mickelson has been very unlucky on the par-three third, hitting the flag. The ball bounced on about fifteen feet away. Woods is also in with a birdie shout, but Harrington's ball lies just five feet from the hole.</p> <p>Colin Huxtable argues: \"I fancy Miguel 'the mullet from La Mancha' Jimenez to be Europe's star player. Anyone with the nerve to sport a follicle formation like that has the requisite nerve to sink bum-clenching five footers.\" Too right.</p> <p><strong>1.47pm:</strong> Jimenez misses his putt, so the first hole is halved.</p> <p>Now for Monty... his putt slides agonisingly past the hole. Woods holes for a four, and the hole is halved with birdies.</p> <p>Donald and McGinley have begun their match, with Langer making his first appearance on the first hole, having a chat with the English rookie. Stewart Cink is in prime position after a cracking drive down the middle of the fairway. Donald's second was hit with a very tricky stance, and has landed right of the green.</p> <p>\"Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez - both haircuts are quite unique. Their hair alone should be worth a point, no?\" ponders kevin Gannon, generously offering the European pair the award for worst barnet. Let's wait to see what Ian Poulter looks like later, shall we?</p> <p><strong>1.40pm:</strong> Harrington and Monty have again hit marvellous approach shots and both have eagle opportunities. With Mickelson in a bunker and Woods through the back of the green, could it be two holes to Europe?</p> <p>On the first green, Jimenez has a putt from about 12 feet to put Europe one up.</p> <p>Ravi Motha makes a fine point. \"Since Tiger likes playing alone, maybe that why he is rumoured to have split up with Elin Nordegren. All I can say is fabulously wealthy but a fool.\"</p> <p><strong>1.30pm:</strong> The second fourball produces similarly poor drives, with the exception of the admirably calm Jimenez, who plonks his ball in the middle of the fairway. The Spaniard follows that up with a second to 12 feet from the pin. Clarke is just off the front of the green, Love is in stuck in a greenside bunker, and Campbell's shot was equally untroubling to the hole.</p> <p>In the first match, all the players are either on the fairway or in the slight rough after their drives. </p> <p><strong>1.27pm:</strong> First blood to Europe! Monty knocks his putt in and Europe are one up. By Monty's own logic, that really ought to make them two up.</p> <p>\"I know that it's raining at Southampton at the moment, but could you not combine the live cricket and golf coverage making it easier for people who want to follow both,\" says Geoff maguire. I'm afraid I only have one pair of eyes, one pair of ears and one pair of hands, so click above for the cricket coverage!</p> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Monty has launched his ball to around six or seven feet from the pin. What is it about the Ryder Cup that brings out the best in him? Harrington has also played a fine shot, leaving himself a 12-foot birdie putt. Woods did well to find the green but faces a very long putt, while Mickelson's second also ended in a similar spot. If one of the two Europeans can hole out, they will almost certainly be one up.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> The pressure has certainly told - all four players have missed the opening fairway. Monty and Harrington are both in the sand, one on each side of the farway, while Woods and Mickelson will also be separating, with each player thrashing his ball into the crowds. Well they do say Woods prefers to go alone when he's playing anyway. The Europeans have a slight advantage because the bunkers are fairly tepid.</p> <p>Robert Pink asks: \"I know this might not be the most obvious question, but which team has the best-looking set of wives? Now that Monty's better half has plumped for Hugh Grant I'm willing to put my cash on the Yanks.\" I'll reserve judgment until I have seen all 24, as such a question should not be answered without thorough research. But the Americans are the early favourites in that regard.</p> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> For anyone interested, Robert Simpson offers his predictions for the opening matches: \"Reckon we will lose the top match but win the other three.\" My opinion, for what it's worth (hardly anything, I know), but I reckon the top match wil be halved, Jimenez and Clarke will win the next match, McGinley and Donald will lose to Riley and Cink, and Toms and Furyk will halve with Garcia and Westwood to leave the scores level.</p> <p>Here's a stat to boost European hopes: the European players have won more world ranking points (273) than the Americans (237) in the last month. So they're certainly the team in form. But will all that go out of the window when Monty hits the first shot? We're about to find out...</p> <p><strong>1pm:</strong>\"Anyone else feel the horrible silence all the way from Detroit as Sutton referred to two of his players as 'Cripples' as they'd had a bit of wrist surgery. Is he the new Glenda Hoddle?\" Phil Godwin queries. I did, Phil, and there was another awful silence when Sutton tried to make a gag about how diligent Langer is. He chuckled at his own joke, but sadly nobody else did. Highly entertaining viewing.</p> <p>Suzy Byrne was less pleased with what she witnessed. \"Consternation growing here (in Ireland) about last nights opening ceremony and the fact that the Irish Anthem was sung in English by a man from Belfast who has lived in Detroit for 15 years... There were enough Irish people in the crowd who knew the anthem who could have sung it! Maybe it will rile Paddy and Paul enough to go out and whip those Yanks.\" Let's hope so. </p> <p>Incidentally, the American team are wearing disappointingly conservative grey slipovers and blue shirts with a little bit of red and white. Surely they have something better lined up for the weekend.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> We're moving ever closer to the big tee-off, and the players are starting to look a little nervous on the range.</p> <p>But enough of that. \"What of the important issues? What colour are the shirts?\" John McClure wants to know. Well, John, the Amercian players have barely been featured so an answer will follow for them, but the European team are wearing rather dismal black and grey shirts and sleeveless pullovers. Hal Sutton is also sporting a rather ridiculous cowboy hat to prove his Americanness. The wives have not been seen yet.</p> <p>Sky are currently doing a ridiculous version of our veryown Small Talk, asking players questions such as their middle names (Toms - Wayne), what they wash first in the shower (Clarke - unspeakable), what's their favourite animal (Tiger - Tiger), and whether they have ever played the bagpipes (Garcia - what are bagpipes?) Oh, and Colin Montgomerie has just informed everyone that he doesn't wear pyjamas. Now there's one for our lady readers.</p> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Monty has just claimed that if he and Harrington can beat Mickelson and Woods in the first match, \"it will literally be worth two points to Europe for the remainder of the week\". Now, am I missing something here? Has there been a change of rules I don't know about? </p> <p>Either way, it certainly is an important match, as is the second. Langer has not missed a trick there by pairing the experienced duo of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Darren Clarke. With McGinley and Donald, and Garcia and Westwood, who were such a formidable team at The Belfry two years ago, to follow, Europe look well positioned to take an advantage this morning. </p> <p>\"Was that perhaps the tackiest opening ceremony ever produced or does my memory coveniently allow me to forget similar ones in years past?\" asks Guy Allen, to which I can only reply in the affirmative. \"I can't believe we have ever seen a US or European captain tell us how much he loves his wife, forget how many kids he has, then succomb to the lower chin wobble as practised by Gazza and Mathew Pinsent.\" </p> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> Welcome to Oakland Hills, Michigan, where the start of the 2004 Ryder Cup is not far away. It's actually only seven o'clock in Detroit, indeed the sun is only just beginning to show itself, so some of the early-rising players are entering the clubhouse now for their pre-match greasy fry-ups (Paul McGinley and Jay Haas), while others are putting on the practice green (Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington). </p> <p>The European team has won three of the last four Ryder Cups, so the Americans are quite rightly \"psyched\" for this one. Captain Hal Sutton, who last night seemed to think the opening ceremony was actually a tribute to himself when he thanked the USGA, his wife, his mum, dad, friends and goldfish or his appointment as skipper, has certainly thrown down a marker to his counterpart Bernard Langer.</p> <p>Sutton has put out his two best players, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods, in the very first match in a bid to win the first point for the Stars and Stripes. But the wily German has matched his opponent by pairing his finest player, Harrington, with his most experienced, Colin Montgomerie. </p> <p>Monty has lost just two of his last 16 Ryder Cup matches and it is he who will hit this year's first drive. It promises to be an absolute cracker on the course named \"The Monster\".</p> <p>The pairings for the opening four-balls, kicking off in an hour's time, are: </p> <p>1.10pm: Mickelson/Woods v Montgomerie/Harrington <br> 1.25pm: Love/Campbell v Clarke/Jimenez <br> 1.40pm: Riley/Cink v McGinley/Donald <br> 1.55pm: Toms/Furyk v Garcia/Westwood</p>",

  "<p>As soon as Insider's private 747 touched the tarmac, she grabbed her champagne flute and her platform Terry de Havillands and ran. And a good thing, too, as this week truly was, to sully one's prose with tabloid argot, \"a veritable star-studded bonanza\". At <strong> Zac Posen</strong>'s predictably paparazzi-pleasing show, a fellow member of the British fashion pack did his noble best to attract the attentions of Stephen \"who?\" Dorff without (a) knowing who he was and (b) realising that Dorff's tastes lie more on the straight and narrow. Still, good to see that British can-do attitude always in evidence. </p> <p>Backstage sounded even more eventful: poor wee Zac had a fashion crisis at the rehearsal when all of his shoes for the show, er, broke. So he put in a quickie call to fairy godmother Anna Wintour who obligingly sent over every spare pair in the fashion cupboard. Ain't life sweet when you're flavour of the moment? </p> <p>Next, on to the <strong> Marc Jacobs</strong> show: hi, Liv! Hey Kate Hudson! How's it hangin', J-Lo (who, Insider can report after careful inspection, does not have a big bum, just a weirdly small waist)? At the waaaaay too packed afterparty, arty folk Sam Taylor-Wood and Rachel Feinstein seemed to be taking one another very seriously over the Atkins-friendly hors d'oeuvres. </p> <p>Despite much excited talk about the presence of Sienna Miller and Jude Law in New York this week, neither deigned to grace the fashion shows with their presence, forcing Insider to ponder at length the significance of both Anna Wintour and Elizabeth Saltzman wearing long pearl ropes with crewneck sweaters. But Insider did pick up a useful tip from a friend on how to talk to Tatler and Heat's favourite couple: don't make any sign that you recognise either because Insider's friend made this foolish error only to be then informed by Ms Miller (22 yrs and precocious with it) that she \"really hates it when people do that as it really creeps her out!\" To which the only possible reply is, well, don't hang out at Soho House in MePa (that's the meatpacking district to you) with Jude Law, you silly sausage, but sadly, Insider was not present to make that point clear to the misguided child. </p> <p>Best front row of the week goes to <strong> Calvin Klein</strong> when Insider sat opposite (deep breath) Ashley Olsen (of Olsen twins \"fame\", who is amazingly skinny considering she is not even the one who is anorexic), Mandy Moore, Vincent Gallo and Elizabeth Taylor - classy types, one and all. Ashley seemed to view the event as live action QVC, indicating different dresses to Mandy and informing her that she \"loves it\" and \"wants it\", simultaneously shaking her head in wonder, like a grand dowager stunned by the beauty of a Renoir oil painting. Ashley is 18, incidentally. Our Liz, meanwhile, was taking a similar approach, pointing to frocks to the man sitting next to her (stylist? GBF? Who knows?) for his approval, which he rarely gave, pointing her in other (and suspiciously wrong) directions. Liz, honey, take it from Insider: stick with the green gown. The orange one would do you no favours. </p> <p>For the last night, Insider was positively deluged with offers: would it be the Calvin Klein dinner? Or maybe the Ghost one at Indochine? The Narciso Rodriguez party, perhaps? At last, Insider decided to grant the boys from Another magazine with her presence at their dinner at Fredericks, an exclusive new club to which admittance is granted not by membership card, but by fingerprint scanning. Only in New York, kids. Zac Posen was there in his favourite pirate jacket, as was Natalie Portman, looking beautiful but tiny, like all proper celebrities do. Bj\u00f6rk also turned up in a white satin bodysuit and Jeremy Scott revealed what he's been up to for the past four years: plaiting his hair and winding it about his scalp. Sadly, the three salad leaves with soy sauce did not suffice for Insider so she had to leave to raid the minibar. Thank god for $8 Snickers bars.</p>",

  "The capacity of Britain's immigration detention centres is to be increased by 1,000 places in the next nine months, as part of the drive to step up the expulsion of failed asylum seekers announced by Tony Blair yesterday . <p>The extra places will mean the number of immigration offenders held in detention at any one time will rise from 900 when Labour came to power to 1,750. </p> <p>Colnbrook immigration removal centre, near Heathrow, which can hold 326 detainees, opened this week as the first phase in the expansion plan. </p> <p>Mr Blair said yesterday the government had a new objective, to ensure that the number of failed asylum seekers removed each month exceeded the number of new applications, by the end of next year. </p> <p>Refugee welfare groups were dismayed by plans which include prison sentences of up to two years for those who destroy their travel documents when they arrive in Britain or refuse to cooperate with attempts to send them home if their applications are refused. </p> <p>Mr Blair said the number of asylum applications had fallen by 70% since their peak in 2002. New claims were now at 1997 levels, but it was possible to get them down further. </p> <p>He said there had been sig nificant progress in removing those who stayed in Britain despite the failure of their applications. </p> <p>The latest figures show an average of 1,043 rejected asylum seekers are deported or removed every month, compared with the arrival of 2,640 applicants. </p> <p>The prime minister said the failure to remove more of those who were rejected \"makes a mockery of our asylum system if those properly denied the right to stay simply flout this decision and remain\", adding: \"It is unfair to those who play by the rules and sends the wrong message to those who may try to come to this country without genuine cause. It undermines public faith in the system.\" </p> <p>He said the new targets would prioritise clearing the backlog of those awaiting removal. But the announcement provoked concern from the Joint Council for the Wel fare of Immigrants (JCWI) and the Refugee Council. </p> <p>Habib Rahman, the chief executive of the JCWI, said: \"We are increasingly concerned at the bias in government statements on abuses of the asylum system. While abuse must be tackled, we should not lose sight of the fact that an asylum system is in place because there are people genuinely fleeing persecution.\" </p> <p>Maeve Sherlock, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, also voiced concern, saying if people were going to be removed at the end of the asylum process, they should be given a fair hearing. </p> <p>\"Restricted access to legal advice, poor initial decisions, an inadequate appeals system and rushing claims through are all contributing to a much increased risk that people will be wrongly returned to face torture or even death.\" </p>",
  "<p>He was as dapper as ever but clearly weary when he arrived at the Lanternhouse arts centre in the south Cumbrian town of Ulverston a little while ago to give a talk about his novels. </p> <p>An apologetic Melvyn Bragg admitted to the organiser, Liz Drew, that he was very tired and would probably not be able to give the audience of 150 keen readers and amateur writers - the town has several thriving literary clubs - too much of his time. </p> <p>\"But as soon as he started he was just brilliant,\" recalled Ms Drew, who runs the Tinners' Rabbit bookstore in Ulverston. \"What was so surprising was that he was so open. He was prepared to lay bare his personal life to make his points about the book and describe how he used his private experiences in his fiction. It was rather wonderful - he was generous not just with his time but with himself.\" </p> <p>Also in the audience was John Fox, a local champion of the alternative arts. He said: \"What impressed me was how honest and direct he was. He was not afraid of opening up to give an insight into the creative processes he uses. I think it made him really quite vulnerable.\" </p> <p>Such openness and straightforwardness may play well at a literary event organised by a bookshop in Bragg's native and beloved Cumbria. There is also a place for such frankness in his own work - indeed Bragg's directness is crucial to the success of the Radio 4 programmes he is most revered for, In Our Time and, before that, Start the Week. </p> <p>Straight-talking may even have a place in the upper house where Lord Bragg of Wigton has not been afraid to speak against the government which gave him his life peerage. But, as he found out to his cost this week, there is a time for openness and a time for discretion. </p> <p>Downing Street was furious at what they saw as a failure in judgment by an old friend of the Blairs when he spoke during a live interview of the \"tremendous stress\" the prime minister had been under in the spring. </p> <p>Bragg's comments gave the media the opportunity to highlight yet again the prime minister's \"wobble\" and probe the Blair-Brown axis. It also gave some the chance to falsely opine that Bragg was part of a conspiracy to win sympathy for Blair. All bad enough as far as No 10 was concerned. But by describing the \"real stress\" as \"personal and family\" Bragg gave some elements of the press the chance to write about the Blairs' private lives - territory which they guard zealously. Bragg's enemies - and any one who has spent 40 years working in the jealous worlds of the media and arts as an executive and star must have a fair few enemies - have relished his discomfort.</p> <p>They see his misjudgment as conclusive evidence of his self aggrandisement, a trait they also perceive in his elegant clothes and much-maligned hairstyle. They say he could not resist showing off just how close he was to the Blairs - \"I call myself a friend,\" he said during the interview. They claim he wants to be regarded not just as a \"Labour luvvie\", the classic Hampstead champagne socialist, but as a political player with a bit of clout and the ear of the prime minister. </p> <p>But friends and political allies leapt to Bragg's defence. Perhaps most passionate was the film-maker David Puttnam, who sits alongside his old pal in the Lords. \"This was classic Melvyn,\" he told the Guardian. \"He was asked a question and he answered it purely in human terms. That is what real human beings do in real life. He was asked a perfectly good question and gave a perfectly good answer.\" </p> <p>Lord Puttnam also believes heartache which Bragg has faced in his own life may have prompted him to answer the question, posed by Alastair Stewart on the ITV News Channel, in such an emotional way. \"Melvyn knows what it is to cope with personal issues while carrying on a public life,\" he said. </p> <p>Bragg has certainly had to deal with personal tragedy, not least the death of his first wife, a French vicomtesse called Lisa Roche. Bragg did not realise until after they married - when he was 21 - that she had a history of suicide attempts. She went into therapy but killed herself in 1971, leaving a daughter, Marie-Elsa. Of the tragedy, he told the Guardian in 1998: \"I could have done things which helped and I did things which harmed. So yes, I feel guilt, I feel remorse.\" </p> <p>Marie-Elsa spent her early life fighting for her own psychological balance. </p> <p>Bragg has channelled other aspects of his life into his fiction. He has written 19 novels, a prolificacy which prompted Dame Edna Everage, among many others, to mock him. Having established that no members of the audience had read any of his books, Edna chided him: \"You're going too fast, Melvyn. We can't keep up with you.\" </p> <p>Bragg draws deeply on his family history and his youth in Wigton for much of his fiction. His Soldier's Return trilogy, which has been much admired, follows a character called Joe, whose father returns from the Burma war. As Joe grows he is torn between his father and mother; he falls in love, he goes up to Oxford. Many of the dates, episodes and relationships match Bragg's - though he has insisted the trilogy is not a thinly disguised autobiography. Rather, he says: \"What I am writing is fiction described as autobiography.\" </p> <p>Cumbria is still very important to Bragg. He looked tanned and healthy when he gave the ITV interview not because he had been sunning himself on a beach but because he had spent three weather-beaten weeks in the north-west. </p> <p>He still has a close-knit group of friends in his hometown, where his parents ran a pub. Eric Hetherington, who attended Wigton primary school and the Nelson Thomlinson grammar school with Bragg, said: \"One of his strongest qualities is loyalty. Bragg loves fine wine - but tends to abstain for the first 10 days or so of every month and then go for it if the mood takes him. He believes it gives him the chance to be a serious drinker, but not an alcoholic. </p> <p>Bragg also finds time to keep in touch with local artists. Some find him patronising but many are grateful. During his recent stay he visited the artist Julian Heaton Cooper, whose father and grandfather were both Lakeland artists, and dropped in at Dove Cottage in Grasmere to cast his eye over a new exhibition on Milton's Paradise Lost. </p> <p>Robert Woof, director of the Wordsworth Trust, who has known Bragg since he was a young novelist, said: \"It's a great lift to have his intelligent input into our work.\" Dr Woof believes Bragg's gift is being able to see what will appeal and interest people. \"But it's not a matter of dumbing down. It's more braining up.\" </p> <p>Fans of Bragg's radio programmes and, of course, the South Bank Show, which he has presented and edited since 1978, might agree. </p> <p>So part of British cultural life is Bragg that there was a national outcry when his appointment to the Lords in 1998 prompted the BBC to remove him from Start the Week. He even made it into the \"Camillagate\" tape - \"It's like that Melvyn Bragg programme,\" whispered Mrs Parker Bowles to Prince Charles, \"I can't start the week without you.\" </p> <p>In Our Time - a forum for tackling \"the big ideas which form the intellectual agenda of our age\" - now numbers academics among its audience. </p> <p>When he became a peer friends joked that he was joining the best club in London but he has taken the job much more seriously. His voting and attendance records are good. In the 2002/3 session he voted 104 times out of a possible 226, a decent effort. He voted once against the government - on the hunting issue. </p> <p>Bragg was close to Neil Kinnock; and Michael Foot is also a guest at his parties. He got to know the Blairs when they lived in Hackney, east London, in the early 1980s. Now friends say the Blairs dine regularly with Bragg and his second wife, the writer and documentary maker Cate Haste, with whom he has two children. The Braggs attended Mrs Blair's 50th birthday party at Chequers at the weekend and the Blairs have visited Wigton. Ms Haste's collaboration with Mrs Blair on their book about prime ministers' spouses, The Goldfish Bowl, cemented the link. </p> <p>Bragg is deeply upset at the impact of his interview. It is made worse because he feels that he ought to have been media-savvy enough to have not got caught out. </p> <p>Bragg is also sad because, as his friends testify, he is a deeply loyal person who does not expect those close to him to reveal the parts of his life he wants kept hidden - and the tabloids have certainly dug for those bits over the years. Friends say that despite his profile and despite his willingness to expose parts of his inner self to the public gaze, he is essentially a shy man. What he is not, of course, is a canny, streetwise politician. </p> <p>Roy Hattersley, the former Labour deputy leader and a Bragg friend, said: \"I don't think that he's a natural politician. He's too straightforward and too trusting. He says what he thinks. But I don't think what he said was so incriminating anyway. It's just that we have such a feral and hysterical press that seizes on such comments. It's a problem with society, not a problem with Melvyn.\"</p> <p><strong> Born </strong> October 6 1939 </p> <p><strong> Education </strong> Nelson Thomlinson grammar school, Wigton; Oxford University </p> <p><strong> Family</strong> Married with two children </p> <p><strong> Career </strong> BBC: general traineeship 1961, producer on Monitor 1963, editor BBC 2 1964; presenter and editor: Read All About It (BBC) 1976-77, South Bank Show (ITV) 1978- (BAFTA Prix Italia 5 times, TV Music ad Arts Programme of the Year TV and Radio Industry Awards 2000); deputy chairman, Border Television 1985-90, chairman 1990-96; governor LSE 1997-; chancellor Leeds University 1999-; president MIND 2002-; occasional contributor: Observer, Sunday Times and Guardian; weekly column Times 1996-98; </p> <p><strong> Awards</strong> John Llewelyn Rhys Award and PEN Awards for Fiction, BAFTA Richard Dimbleby Award for Outstanding Contribution to TV 1987, winner BAFTA Huw Wheldon Award for Best Arts Programme or Series (for An Interview with Dennis Potter) 1994, Best New Radio Series (for Routes of English) 2000</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 July 2015.

  "<p>Last year VSO, the international development charity, published a position paper on how its work in ELT can contribute to its wider strategy on tackling poverty and empowering disadvantaged people in some of the poorest communities in the world. As a result VSO's ELT work is concentrating on areas where disadvantage is most severe and widespread, rather than more developed countries that are able to invest in an education system.</p> <p>VSO works in almost 40 countries and supports ELT in 21 of them, including Cambodia, China, Namibia and Vietnam. The paper sets out a policy that ensures VSO will look at how the widespread growth of English language skills can contribute to improving long-term economic, cultural and political development when assessing its work in a country.</p> <p>The charity is striving to improve English teaching where it has been relatively inaccessible rather than boosting English teaching for more educated groups. The charity also examines a variety of other factors to determine whether a country's development would benefit from ELT support. These include whether English is an official language, needed to enter secondary or post-secondary education or vital to gain work because it is widely used in certain fields, such as tourism and business.</p> <p>Having identified the areas it will work in, VSO is also developing the way in which its volunteers are working and the types of teacher it needs to recruit. The average age of a volunteer is 38, and increasingly volunteers are moving away from straight classroom teaching and focusing on training teachers, improving teaching methodology and influencing education policy in developing countries throughout the world. </p> <p>Much of VSO's philosophy is based on the ever-growing ripple effect, whereby through working in partnership with colleagues and sharing skills a volunteer's work has a more long-term and sustainable impact. This is illustrated by the work of volunteers in China where, at any one time, more than 120 professionals are helping to train 12,000 Chinese schoolteachers. These teachers will go on to educate more than a million students each year. This far-reaching framework is much more effective than a volunteer teaching English to one class before heading home.</p> <p>The result is that VSO is looking to recruit more mature and experienced volunteer teachers, who have the experience needed to work in an education management or teacher training. These professionals will share their expertise with educational organisations and governments to establish teacher-training programmes and offer advice on ELT curriculum development.</p> <p>Former ELT volunteer Frances Platt, 53, had been teaching Italian at Leeds University in England for five years when she decided to apply to VSO. Based in Banepa, Nepal, Platt's placement focused on improving teaching methodology and encouraging colleagues to move away from traditional rote learning to student-centred activities, which are more effective at engaging pupils.</p> <p>Platt visited rural schools, working alongside colleagues to develop their lesson style, encouraging the use of resources such as games and pictures, rather than \"chalk and talk\" teaching. \"Teaching using simple picture and language games was a revelation. Suddenly lessons had a fun element. Personally, I felt incredibly privileged to live and work in such a different culture,\" says Platt.</p> <p>For many volunteers VSO offers a valuable professional development opportunity. While working abroad they often hold positions of greater responsibility than at home and they gain experience of a wide variety of roles. They gain greater proficiency in policy making, management and training, a wider range of teaching styles, an enhanced awareness of global issues and better team-working skills.</p> <p>Platt's experience of working in another country has improved her understanding of other cultures, and this has helped her since she returned to Britain and started teaching English to asylum seekers at a college in West Yorkshire. \"I feel I can offer them more as I can empathise with how they see our culture,\" she says.</p> <p>Andrew Morris volunteered for VSO's ELT programmes in China and Eritrea and his experiences have also contributed to his career development. He now works worldwide as an ELT consultant and has praised the opportunities his placements gave him. </p> <p>\"Tolerance, openness to learning, sensitivity to others and professionalism are all values embedded in the VSO experience,\" he says, \"and they have provided a real platform for my efforts over the years. VSO is, in many employers' eyes, a byword for resilience, adaptability and the ability to use your own initiative.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Teachers wanting to volunteer must have a degree, a Tefl certificate or PGCE in modern languages and one year's teaching experience. Volunteers are provided with return flights, accommodation and a local living allowance. VSO also covers the cost of training, national insurance contributions during service and health insurance.

  "Raghda Alassar's classmates did not hear the Israeli bullet that tore into the nine-year-old's brain as she wrote an English test. But as a pool of blood spread across her desk and spilled on to the floor, a wall of screams rose from the classroom of the UN elementary school for girls in Khan Yunis. <p>At that point Raghda was still crying for help. By the time she was hauled into the trauma room of a neighbouring hospital she was silent. </p> <p>For five crucial days the army blocked Raghda's transfer to an Israeli hospital with the facilities to offer a glimmer of hope. An infection set in. </p> <p>On Tuesday doctors told her father, Adnad, that she was brain dead. </p> <p>\"The bullet entered under her eye and went out the back of her head,\" Mr Alassar said. </p> <p>\"It took them a long time to stop the bleeding, and her heart stopped and they gave her shocks. From that moment she was like a dead body, although she wasn't dead.\" </p> <p>\"I find it so difficult to believe what happened to my daughter. She was at school, just carrying her notebook, not a gun. What is my daughter - nine years old - guilty of that she has to be shot? It's state terror against the whole population.\" </p> <p>In recent weeks the Israelis have again been preoccupied with terrorism, from the murder of 16 people in the Beersheba bus bombings to the slaughter of Russian schoolchildren in Beslan, which received blanket coverage. </p> <p>During the six months of relative peace for Israelis, until the Beersheba bombings, the army killed more than 400 Palestinians. Most were fighters, but they also included about 40 children under 15. Palestinians say this also is a form of terror. </p> <p>\"We're always listening for the helicopters, listening for the tanks, listening for the bombs,\" said Khitam abu Shawarib, the only social worker in Rafah refugee camp, on the southern tip of the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>\"I am very sorry when I hear of a Jewish woman or children killed. I think it is wrong and many people here think it is wrong. But what the Jews suffer is nothing to the terror we live with from them. </p> <p>\"It takes such a toll on our health, on society, most of all on the children.\" </p> <p>Israelis live in fear of random attacks, principally the suicide bombing of buses and cafes, and shootings in the occupied territories. But they are generally safe in their homes and are more likely to be killed in a road accident than by a bomb. </p> <p>In southern Gaza and parts of the West Bank there is often no sanctuary from the seemingly relentless, indiscriminate Israeli shooting. </p> <p>Israel classifies Gaza Strip towns such as Rafah and Khan Yunis, and Nablus and Jenin in the West Bank, as war zones. </p> <p>That, the army says, justifies the firing of powerful sophisticated weapons into residential areas or the bulldozing of scores of homes each month, ostensibly in search of rarely discovered tunnels for smuggling in weapons. </p> <p>Barely a night passes in Rafah or Khan Yunis without the machine-gun fire that has shredded hundreds of homes, forcing families to sleep in a single inner room behind bricked up windows or a second wall. </p> <p>Others live in the rubble of their bulldozed houses, perpetually in the firing line from the rarely seen soldiers high in the gun towers. </p> <p>A fortnight ago 15-year-old Mazen al-Ara was trying to lead his siblings away from tanks and heavy shooting around their house on the edge of the \"Philadelphi Road\", the highly militarised border at Rafah. </p> <p>The army had partially destroyed the family home months before, but the Aras went on living there because they had no money to move. </p> <p>Usually they sheltered in an inner room when the shooting began, but that night it was so intense that Mazen said they would all be killed if they stayed. </p> <p>As he led the terrified group into the street, Mazen was caught by a burst of fire. The boy died; doctors took 18 bullets from his body. </p> <p>A few days earlier 10-year-old Munir al-Daqas left his home in Jabalya refugee camp to visit his grandparents' house five minutes' walk away. Israeli tanks were on the far side of the camp, but no one saw any danger in the heart of Jabalya, around its bustling market, in daylight. </p> <p>\"It must have been a sniper,\" his mother, Kifah, said. \"People told me as I was shopping in the market. I couldn't believe it. Munir was just there with me and now they were saying he was dead.\" </p> <p>Mrs Daqas unfolded a picture of the semi-naked body of her son in his grave. There is a bullet wound in the chest and another in the groin. </p> <p>In four years of intifada, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights says, the army has killed 136 children in Rafah and Khan Yunis, a quarter of all the Palestinian children who have died during the uprising, because of its \"indiscriminate shooting, excessive force, a shoot-to-kill policy and the deliberate targeting of children\". </p> <p>The dead in Khan Yunis and Rafah in recent weeks also include two 12-year-old boys, a 15-year-old girl and a 75-year-old man in a wheelchair, Ibrahim Halfalla, who was crushed under the rubble of his own home by an army bulldozer as his wife begged the soldiers not to advance. </p> <p>The army has not offered an explanation for the killing of Raghda Alassar, but it frequently says that child victims are caught in crossfire during Palestinian attacks on the army or Jewish settlers. </p> <p>There were no such battles when Raghda Alassar and Munir Daqas were hit. Or when a bullet pierced the blind of Sara Zorob's living room and struck the 10-year-old in the chest, killing her instantly. </p> <p>Commanders in Gaza have admitted in the past that when their soldiers are attacked they are allowed to fire back randomly, risking civilian lives. </p> <p>There are other young victims, as well. </p> <p>\"The children who are physically injured are not the only ones harmed,\" said Usama Freona, a psychologist at the UN clinic in Rafah. </p> <p>\"The levels of violence children are exposed to is horrific. </p> <p>\"We work in a lot of schools to treat the children. In the one next to Kfar Darom [a Jewish settlement in Gaza], all the children are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Most of them were crying and shaking when they were speaking about their experiences. There is a lot of bedwetting.\" </p> <p>Mohammed abu Yusuf is the counsellor at Raghda Alassar's school. </p> <p>\"After Raghda was shot,\" he said, \"the children were crying and screaming. Five girls in her class still won't come back to school. We took Raghda's desk away and brought another but none of the students will sit at it.\" </p> <p>Raghda Alassar is not the first child shot at the cluster of UN schools in Khan Yunis. Last year an Israeli bullet blinded Huda Darwish, 12, as she sat at her desk. </p> <p>Mrs Daqas said her other children could not comprehend Munir's death. </p> <p>\"Munir's younger brother doesn't understand he is dead. He thought he would come back after the funeral and kept asking why Munir has come when we've had 'the party' for him. His four-year-old sister asks every day if we can search the market because Munir must be lost,\" she said. </p> <p>Mr Freona said the constant violence begets violence. </p> <p>\"Look at the games children play. Most of the boys play Arabs and Jews. Many want to play the role of the Jews. They see that the Israeli soldiers are the ones with the guns and they are strong and they see that is the most important thing,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They see guns as the source of power, the solution to dealing with any problem, the way to get what they want.\" </p> <p>With that has come a collapse in respect for authority. </p> <p>The image of Mohammed al-Dura, the 12-year-old Gaza boy shot as his father vainly tried to protect him from Israeli gunfire in the first days of the latest intifada, is seared on the Palestinian consciousness. </p> <p>It has come to symbolise what they see as the callous indifference of Israeli forces to the lives of their children. But Mrs Abu Shawarib said it had a further impact on many children, who saw that a father was unable to protect his son. </p> <p>\"The respect for authority is shattered because children see their fathers beaten in front of them,\" she said. \"The authority of the father, who used to just have to utter one word for the child to obey, is shattered. The father looks helpless to protect the child and the child thinks they are alone.\" </p> <p>Another result of the perpetual killing was that many children came to expect an early death and to welcome the prospect of becoming a \"martyr\". </p> <p>\"The martyr is in paradise, he has glory here and in the afterlife where it is so much better than life in Rafah,\" she said. \"The children see many people killed, so they come to expect to be killed. This is horrible, that children should accept the possibility of death.\"</p>",
  "Prime ministers make environment speeches about every two years. Invariably they make platitudinous statements about how important nature is for today's quality of life and tomorrow's generations. On Tuesday Tony Blair took the now orthodox line - just as he did in 2000 and 2002 - that climate change is happening as a result of human behaviour, and that disaster looms if nothing is done to avert it. <p>This green speech was the most anxious of the three Mr Blair has made in office, mixing evidence of the growing number of extreme climatic events with estimates of the escalating costs of dealing with more frequent and intense heat waves, floods and storms. The overriding positive, he said, was that \"with the political and collective will\", climate change could be addressed. </p> <p>But for all the green rhetoric, there's little evidence yet that this government - or any other - has the political will to address what is now accepted as a potentially overwhelming global problem. </p> <p>Britain sees itself as the world leader in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and aims, ambitiously, to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 60% from their 1990 levels by 2050. But the government glosses over the fact that we are on track to miss by a mile our commitment to reduce emissions by 20% by 2010. </p> <p>The evidence comes from Cambridge Econometrics, the leading independent trackers and forecasters of UK greenhouse gas emissions. In a study published in July, they said we would easily meet the far lower targets required under the still unratified Kyoto agreement. </p> <p>Emissions from power generation, said the authors, are likely to drop by 5.5%, largely because of the investment in wind power, but those from domestic and transport sources are rising steeply, undermining the push to renewables. Emissions from road transport will, by 2010, rise by 14% from 1990 levels. </p> <p>The problem, agreed other political parties and most environment groups this week, is that the government is pursuing two opposite agendas. Even as green Labour urges business and consumers to invest in renewables and use less power, grey Labour is quietly engineering some of the greatest expansions seen in road and air transport in decades. The result is that emissions are rising and little real environmental progress is possible. </p> <p>The responsibility for domestic energy conservation, point out the greens, has been passed to cash-starved local authorities; the government has presided over a 17% increase in road traffic; reduced its support for renewables; and is well short of its target to spend a meagre \u00a320m on solar roofs. Meanwhile, it is subsidising by \u00a3500m the new Airbus - 13 times the total amount pledged for all non-nuclear renewables in 2002. It may have encouraged a massive increase in wind power, but the consensus is that it is not getting to grips with energy conservation, nor is it pushing strongly enough for alternatives like marine power. </p> <p>Last month, the environmental audit committee of the Commons agreed. Its report on energy and climate change said the government's energy strategy was now \"seriously off course\" and that \"more imaginative and radical\" policies were needed for transport. Transport's share of UK emissions, it says, will rise from 18.7% in 1990 to an expected 26.3% in 2010. Air transport's has almost doubled between 1990 and 2002, moving groups like Transport 2000 to accuse the government of being \"in denial\". </p> <p>But Mr Blair, encouraged by the Foreign Office, which has long seen the diplomatic benefit of Britain being a global environmental leader, has his sights on getting the world to change its energy habits. Next year, he said on Tuesday, Britain will use its presidency of the EU and the G8 to push for international climate change action. </p> <p>This is optimistic, if much needed. Far from being the environmental paragon it likes to suggest it is, Europe is on course to fail to meet even its low Kyoto target of 5.2% cuts in emissions on 1990 figures by 2012. According to the European Environment Agency, overall emissions are only 2.1% lower than in 1990. Only France, Germany, Sweden and the UK are likely to meet their targets and Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Denmark and Greece are all expected to overshoot - some substantially. Most OECD countries have the same problems as Britain: carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles in Europe will rise by 30% by 2010, says the agency. </p> <p>Mr Blair, who is pinning his hopes on the emergence of an international trading market in emissions and better technology, will have an even more uphill struggle to persuade countries outside Europe to cut emissions. George Bush reportedly now accepts the evidence that climate change is happening, but his administration is implacably opposed to the Kyoto process which involves only rich countries cutting back emissions. Meanwhile, John Kerry is coy about committing the US to cuts. </p> <p>Russia is the wild card on which the Kyoto process depends. But it is preocccupied and quite likely to kill off the international treaty - which took more than 10 years to negotiate - by delaying its decision to the point where it is too late for countries to adopt in time to cut emissions. </p> <p>The government will soon review its climate change strategy, and can be expected to come up with some eye-catching solar and alternative energy plans. But until it gets to grips with transport, it will continue to be running with the hares and riding with the hounds. Which mostly ends in disaster. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Vidal is the Guardian's environment editor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.vidal@theguardian.com\">john.vidal@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Australia is beginning to see its approach to English language teaching in a new light. Awareness is growing that more than half the world's English communication is between non-native speakers - many of them on Australia's doorstep.</p> <p>There is also a niggling sense of shame - some would say pride - that Australia's unflinching support for the \"coalition of the willing\" in Iraq has helped reinstate English as a language of overt imperialism.</p> <p>Just whose English is being taught, and for whose benefit, is one of the many questions being grappled with by researchers around the world under the applied linguistics banner of Tesol - Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages. As usual down-under, there are some uniquely Australian answers.</p> <p>\"It's been one of our great failings in Tesol that we've focused too much on the language and teaching methodologies, while ignoring vast issues to do with economics, politics and culture,\" says Alastair Pennycook, professor of language in education at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p> <p>By way of example, he cites research brought back from East Timor by one of his PhD students, Ros Appleby. \"When East Timor became independent, there were were urgent calls in Australia for English teachers,\" he says. \"They flew up there and were given Australian text-books as materials, full of pictures and phrases such as 'here is my toaster', or 'this is my fridge' - profoundly irrelevant to people who don't own these things.</p> <p>\"These were people surrounded by foreigners speaking English and working on development projects. The students were saying 'we want a piece of this action', and the teachers were saying 'here's how to name expensive consumer items'.\"<br>Appleby's research focused on a group of female Australian teachers who fell into three main groups. \"Some carried on regardless, saying 'I know what I'm doing. I've brought this curriculum from Australia and I'm sticking to it',\" says Pennycook. \"At the other extreme were teachers who managed to rework their whole way of teaching in relation to those students, their needs and the political context.</p> <p>\"The largest group were saying 'I don't know what to do. These books don't work. I don't know why we're teaching English' - the competing demands of students, programmes, politics and economies left them very limited options.\"</p> <p>From one perspective, the East Timorese experience exposes a glaring lack of social, political and cultural awareness among the teachers. Yet there are other feet at which to lay the blame.</p> <p>Associate Professor David Hall, head of linguistics at Macquarie University, says struggling teachers invariably point towards struggling managers - his specialist area of research: \"Language teachers often get into management positions at a very junior level - team leader or subject leader - without any management training at all. In fact, they may have drifted into language teaching initially, ending up in a career almost by accident. When they realise it is a career, they start looking for ways to learn more about it.\"</p> <p>Hall believes there is a growing trend towards professionalism in ELT: \"Lots of countries are tightening up on the qualifications required of teachers. You can't get into teaching in a Japanese university now without a masters or equivalent.\"<br>English for academic purposes is a vitally important area for Tesol research in Australia, largely because Australian universities are increasingly dependent on revenue from full-fee paying overseas students.</p> <p>Within this field, the hot topic is plagiarism. Alex Barthel, director of UTS's English Language Study Skills Assistance (Elssa) Centre, says: \"Plagiarism is, by and large, an educational issue. The vast majority of those caught do it unintentionally - if you ask whether it's been explained to them, the answer is no,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Much of the fault lies with universities - they should be focusing more effort on teaching academic writing, including how to cite and how not to plagiarise. It's not as simple as handing out a slip of paper with assignments warning against plagiarism.\" </p> <p>Away from campus life, and often away from the city, Australians - and linguistics researchers - have made great strides in understanding another group of overseas students - refugees.</p> <p>Public attitudes have changed markedly since the height of \"refugee phobia\" three years ago. Opinion polls show a new groundswell of public empathy for asylum seekers, to the extent that rural communities, impressed by the civility and work-ethic of refugee labourers, have created a 60-branch lobby group, Rural Australians for Refugees.</p> <p>Dr Michelle de Courcy of the University of Melbourne has spent the past couple of years working with one such rural community, focusing on a group of Iraqi refugees in northern Victoria.</p> <p>With colleagues Dr Howard Nicholas and Dr Lynda Yates from La Trobe University, De Courcy studied Iraqi teenagers from intact family units, tracking their language development and cultural adjustment. Within the study cohort, Christian girls and all boys attended local high-schools, whereas Muslim teenage girls were required by their parents to attend single-sex classes organised for them at a local college of technical and further education (Tafe).</p> <p>\"It was very interesting that some of the students with very negative attitudes to life in Australia still very often made very good languages gains,\" says De Courcy. \"Also, any way we cut the cake, the girls studying at the Tafe were bottom of the ladder.</p> <p>\"For the boys, in common with a colleague in Sweden, we've found what we call the 'soccer factor'. Though they might not make friends with what they consider to be 'Australians' - local kids from Albanian or Turkish backgrounds, say - they and their friends are all very fond of the 'world game'.</p> <p>\"They play football with the other boys and use English when they're playing, because that's the only common language.\"</p>",
  "<p>The third film from Iranian prodigy Samira Makhmalbaf is also the first film set in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, and its setting, the ruined city of Kabul, gives it an unsettling quality all its own. The film is seen largely from the viewpoint of its lead character, a young woman balancing a hardline Islamic upbringing from her father with a thirst for knowledge and education, both denied to women by the previous regime. This is symbolised by her switch of shoes to a pair of forbidden white heels as she leaves home. There's something a bit like a romantic comedy in here too as she gets to know a refugee whose approach is a believable mixture of support for her political ambitions and gentle teasing.</p> <p>The lead role is played with great charm by Agheleh Rezaie - she reminded me of the equally serious election agent in Babak Payami's Secret Ballot. But the lighter moments never obscure the fact that this is a hard life getting harder by the day as refugees crowd in and food gets scarcer. It's a necessary reminder that Iraq is not the only crisis country in the area, and you find yourself hoping that audiences in Afghanistan or Iran are allowed to see it. Makhmalbaf's wonderful debut, The Apple, about two sisters emerging from virtual imprisonment, also makes its DVD debut this week.</p>",

  "<p> If chilling out won Ryder Cups, Bernhard Langer's European team would be already on the plane home, the finely wrought golden trophy occupying its own seat. Under the gentle guidance of their German captain, the dozen golfers from England, Scotland, Ireland, Spain and France are approaching today's opening four-ball matches in a mood that can only be described as serene. </p> <p>Yesterday, for the third day in a row, the 35,000 golf fans and corporate guests lining the rolling Oakland Hills course looked on in amazement as the Europeans smiled and joked their way from tee to green. </p> <p> \"Here come the Cee-gar Guys,\" an American spectator said as Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez strolled down the fourth fairway during their final practice round at this country club in a Detroit suburb, puffing contentedly on Havanas the size of Cadillac exhaust pipes. Close behind them came Colin Montgomerie and Padraig Harrington, exchanging banter. </p> <p> Where were the twitches and grimaces and thousand-yard stares that are supposed to accompany the preparations for a competition that has become one of the most bitterly contested rivalries in world sport? As Langer cast his spell of quiet confidence throughout the team this week, it was hard to tell his five Ryder Cup debutants from his veterans of previous battles. </p> <p> For signs of tension you had to turn to the home team, whose preparations have been rather less sure-footed as their captain, Hal Sutton, attempts to regain the trophy yielded up on a tumultuous afternoon at The Belfry two years ago. </p> <p> On that occasion the US effort appeared to be affected by the players' attempt to repair the image so badly damaged by the berserk charge of Ben Crenshaw's squad on to the 17th green at Brookline in 1999. Under Curtis Strange, Crenshaw's successor, they were calm, they were polite, they were gentlemen. And they lost. </p> <p>Sutton, this year's captain, is a Brookline veteran. \"The Horse\", as Crenshaw described him, was among the players who sat and listened with moistening eyes on the Saturday night while George W Bush, then still 18 months away from the presidency, read out a letter written by a Texan soldier during the defence of the Alamo. The next day they went out and slaughtered Europe in the decisive singles matches. </p> <p>What Sutton knows is that giving his players a Rolex watch apiece and surrounding them with a comfortable ambience has absolutely nothing to do with success in the Ryder Cup. Nor is it about winning the beauty contest of the parade of wives and girlfriends at last night's opening ceremony, although Sutton did say that their general contribution to the team effort could be worth \"half a point\". </p> <p> It is about a sense of collective identity forged in extreme circumstances, as featured in a thousand Hollywood war movies. In this case, it is about nudging a bunch of self-centred millionaires towards the realisation that a weekend without a big cheque at the end of it can still have some sort of meaning.</p> <p> Not surprisingly, then, something of the bellicosity that fuelled earlier contests has filtered back into the US approach. \"Like going ashore with the Marines\" was how Jackie Burke Jr, Sutton's 81-year-old vice captain, recently described the desired mindset. The raising of the flags at last night's opening ceremony was supervised by the commanding officer of the Theodore Roosevelt, a US Navy aircraft carrier also known as The Big Stick. </p> <p>But professional golfers are not soldiers, and it remains to be seen whether the occasional indulgence will pay off. When Phil Mickelson asked to be excused practice on Wednesday, saying that it was his habit to take that day off before a major, Sutton reasoned that if Mickelson was prepared to take the Ryder Cup as seriously as a major, then he was not going to stand in his way. Over in the European team room, however, where not one member of the team has a major to his name, eyebrows were raised. </p> <p>\"I think we're going to get the job done this week,\" Sutton said as he stood on the red carpet outside Detroit's Fox Theatre before Thursday night's black-tie gala, at which the teams and their consorts were presented and most of the US players were revealed to be married to blonde women called Amy. His understatement carried an echo of Crenshaw's famous remark at Brookline, as the US faced the final day with a fourpoint deficit. \"I have a good feeling about this,\" he said, to widespread disbelief. </p> <p>Not that the 35th edition of Samuel Ryder's competition is the first thing on the minds of Detroit's sports fans this morning, who are more concerned with the news that an industrial dispute may force the cancellation of the ice hockey season, thus depriving them of the chance to cheer on their beloved Red Wings. Harrington's arrival seemed chiefly significant for his familial relationship - real, albeit distant - to Joey of that ilk, the brilliant young quarterback of the Lions, Detroit's NFL contenders. </p> <p> But to a city pockmarked by abandoned factories and scarred by decades of chilling crime statistics, where virtually all that is left of the once almighty automobile industry and the world-beating Motown record label is a bunch of relics gathered together in museums all over town, the Ryder Cup represents a symbol of renewal, something to set against yesterday's front-page story about the 17-year-old boy and his 13-year-old accomplice charged with the fatal shooting of a 72-year-old deacon after a church barbecue on Tuesday. </p> <p> Not that such concerns are allowed to darken the mood in this corner of the affluent outer suburbs. This week Oakland Hills has become corporate city. Rows of temporary chalets bear the names of merchant banks. Cadillac courtesy limousines slide in and out of the clubhouse car park. The introduction to last night's opening ceremony was performed by Donald Trump, a self-made and re-made zillionaire most recently reincarnated as the star of his own networked reality TV show. </p> <p>The legacy of Brookline is evident in the ban on taking alcohol on to the course. But plenty of drinking will still be done in the hospitality areas and on an adjacent course, where the organisers have built something that they claim to be, at 70,000 sq ft, the largest sports bar in the world. </p> <p> By Sunday night, one set of players will be drowning their sorrows while the others drown in champagne. And we shall know whether the Big Stick and the blondes called Amy can be beaten by a sense of proportion and a good Cuban cigar.</p>",
  "<p>The bizarre case of Sean Fox, who was accused of deliberately jumping from a horse during a race at Fontwell in March, reached its conclusion yesterday when the rider was cleared of any wrongdoing by the Jockey Club's disciplinary panel. </p> <p>Fox appeared at Portman Square to appeal against a 21-day riding ban imposed after his controversial ride on Ice Saint in the Cantor Sport Beginners' Chase at the Sussex track on March 8. </p> <p>Ice Saint had drifted in the pre-race betting from an opening price of 2-1 out to 4-1, and from even money out to 5-1 on the leading betting exchange, Betfair. </p> <p>He parted company with his jockey at the ninth fence, which Ice Saint appeared to jump cleanly. Shortly after the obstacle, however, Fox appeared to step from the saddle, and landed on his feet. </p> <p>It was later revealed that the Jockey Club's security department had been alerted to unusual betting patterns surrounding the race before it had taken place. The Fontwell stewards initially took no action over the incident, but after being alerted to the doubts surrounding the contest, they reviewed the video and decided to ban Fox from riding for 21 days under Rule 157 of the Rules of Racing, which covers \"intent to conceal\" a horse's ability. </p> <p>A brief statement released by the Jockey Club after yesterday's hearing said that the disciplinary panel had been \"advised by their legal assessor that when considering the case they had to be clear in their own minds that Sean Fox had deliberately stepped off Ice Saint before they could take into account any other evidence relating to the race. The panel concluded they could not be satisfied that Fox had stepped off and therefore ... they did not consider additional evidence presented ... and upheld Fox's appeal against the suspension on the day.\" </p> <p>The Jockey Club statement added: \"Had the additional evidence presented demonstrated a motive for Sean Fox to step off the horse, the legal advice may well have been different.\" </p> <p>Fox was close to tears as he left Portman Square last night, but he did offer a brief statement before being overcome by emotion. </p> <p>\"It has been six months of hell,\" the jockey said.\"It is going to be difficult [to resume a riding career] after a cloud this big, obviously it isn't going to lighten overnight. I've got to pick up the pieces and hopefully racing will accept me back.\" </p> <p>Fox, 33, who always denied any wrongdoing, has had a handful of rides since the Ice Saint incident, but has yet to partner a horse in the current jumps season which started in late April. He is believed to have spent the last few months laying sewer mains. </p> <p>Rory Mac Neice, Fox's solicitor, said that his client had \"for six months consistently denied doing anything wrong, and the vast majority of people have simply ignored that. He has been completely vindicated. </p> <p>\"The disciplinary panel have given him a fair hearing, and they themselves should be congratulated for taking that role. It is a good day for Sean, and also a good day for the Jockey Club.\" </p> <p>Mac Neice added that he felt coverage of the incident in the immediate aftermath of the Fontwell race, which included a front-page lead in the Sun newspaper, had been \"very poor.\" </p> <p>He added: \"People jumped to conclusions, and in relation to Sean, if there's one lesson to be learned here, it is that in future we should wait until we have all the facts before we do that.\"</p>"
