  "<p><strong> Eichmann: His Life and Crimes </strong><br>by David Cesarani<br>352 pp, Heinemann, \u00a320</p> <p> Through Hannah Arendt's New Yorker coverage of his trial in 1961 and her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, Adolf Eichmann is remembered mostly for her famous catchphrase, \"the banality of evil\". It was a persuasive if erroneous reading. There was very little banal about Eichmann, though at his trial most expressed disappointment at his insignificance. Where was the strutting SS officer in his death's-head cap who had boasted of killing millions of Jews? Only Harold Rosenberg, writing in Commentary, noted a level of calculation in his performance, \"created over the years for just this courtroom situation\". </p> <p>Eichmann's trial was taken to be about many things; for most it was about totalitarianism. Only Eichmann saw it as being about himself. Indeed, his own convoluted version, with him as death's reluctant travel agent, is now taken to be more accurate than the prosecution's case of grand conspirator. This is not to excuse him. In this excellent and thorough biography, with its emphasis on the political mechanisms and confusions that allowed for such a moral collapse, Cesarani points out that, by the time he was finished in Hungary in 1944, \"he was rotten from the inside out\". He explains Eichmann less in the context of totalitarianism than by charting the process through which a man not hard-wired to kill ends up a willing collaborator in the business of genocide. </p> <p>The result is scrupulously objective in a way its subject would have approved. Any hatchet-job is reserved for Arendt, dismissed as an unreliable witness because her prejudices ironically mirrored those of Eichmann. Her German Jewish bourgeois background expressed itself in a long-nurtured contempt for the \"Ostjuden\" and her comments on the Israelis veered into racism. It is an instructive lesson, verging on black comedy, on the complications of prejudice. </p> <p>As much as Eichmann's, the prejudice of others determined the deportation of Europe's Jews. Hungarian officials proved especially willing subscribers, undertaking all duties from asset stripping to loading the trains, leaving Eichmann with little to do. He played the violin at soirees in a quartet of co-workers. Young women in his office found him handsome and \"cheery\". He played table tennis with the secretaries. In his book Danube, Claudio Magris noted: \"The technocrat of massacre loved meditation, inner absorption, the peace of the woods, maybe even prayer.\" </p> <p>His undoing was the deep humourlessness noted by his captors, accompanied by an even more striking inflexibility of mind. His lethal delusion was exemplified on the one hand by his insistence on himself as a referent, carrying out orders approved by his superiors; and on the other by his disappointment when a book he wrote in May 1942, with an anticipated print run of 50,000, was banned. Its subject was statistical data of Jewish transports. Of his work, he commented without irony: \"Time just flew by.\" </p> <p>Cesarani dispels myths of Eichmann's unhappy childhood, placing him against the normal but selective background of Austrian Calvinism - very different from the previous picture of an embittered man who turned Nazi on grounds of social disgrace and economic hardship or out of resentment against Jewish employers. Eichmann, diligent worker and dutiful son, grew up in a milieu where dislike of Jews was unremarkable; where little animosity was displayed towards individual Jews but \"Jewry\" was viewed as an alien body in the German national organism. It was a fantasy to which he became increasingly susceptible, but he was not driven in the first instance by racial hatred. </p> <p>His was a job-in-waiting rather than one envisioned, with no sign that the underfunded SS department he joined before the war would become instrumental in anti-Jewish policy. Cesarani takes the current position on the Third Reich as more muddle than efficiency. At his trial Eichmann described in numbing detail administrative structures of such byzantine complexity and density that he vanished into insignificance within them, until one of the judges, moved to exasperation, declared: \"It is clear to us that, in German, the predicate comes at the end of the sentence, but it takes too long to reach the predicate.\" His captors had previously noted his German as \"hideous - the jargon of a Nazi bureaucrat pronounced in a mixture of Berlin and Austrian accents and further garbled by his liking for endlessly complicated sentences in which he himself would occasionally get lost\". </p> <p>The road to genocide was neither as predictable nor predetermined as has been assumed. Eichmann's department distanced itself from Goebbels's rabble-rousing with cooler arguments, declaring that Jews were entitled to their own national homeland and Germany should do all it could to assist. Eichmann first showed his teeth in 1938 in Austria, speeding up Jewish emigration and devising a funding mechanism whereby the wealthy paid for the emigration of the poor, a blatant scam that made sense only in the context of discrimination and terror. </p> <p>His more acceptable face was evident the following year. As emigration still remained the order of the day, he was happy to cooperate with Zionist smugglers organising illicit transports of Jews to Palestine. But his essential indifference became apparent in the enforced deportation of Jews to Poland in 1939, a project dressed up in the language of \"resettlement\" that left thousands to rot in an inhospitable landscape. The lesson learned by Eichmann's superiors from his lethal efficiency was that it was possible with little expenditure of effort or capital to deport wholesale. Eichmann then went to work on the Poles. His development was complete before extermination became official. The job remained the same regardless of the fate of his transportations. </p> <p>The notorious Wannsee conference of 1942 here becomes less of a point of no return and more of a rationalisation of an existing unofficial policy. Mass shootings of civilian populations on the eastern front had already been carried out and local pogroms were encouraged. By the end of 1941, more than half a million Jews had been slaughtered and the killing had grown indiscriminate. And no one wanted the responsibility of being lumbered with Eichmann's deportations. </p> <p>Eichmann's own transition to genocide was not entirely smooth. He had been revolted observing killings in the field and recorded his loss of face at Auschwitz where \"they laughed, naturally, when my nerves broke down and I couldn't keep my military dignity\". He moaned that annihilation wasn't a political solution, being enough of a careerist to know that previous solutions offered more chance of prestige and promotion than mass murder. </p> <p>After the war he demonstrated a cunning for survival noted at his trial. Life in hiding in Germany consisted of several rural idylls, apparently untroubled by conscience, but after his escape to South America the career took on an air of willed failure. He missed out on the Nazi gravy train in Argentina. Josef Mengele, Auschwitz's \"angel of death\", was moving in exalted circles. Eichmann, by contrast, was on the verge of squalor. The two men met and failed to get on. Mengele made an offer of free medical treatment, which Eichmann, perhaps mindful of the doctor's wartime experiments, declined. All his businesses failed. He even had a go at his old job, working as transportation manager (for a firm manufacturing sanitary ware), but that didn't work out either. </p> <p>His capture was not the zealous affair his kidnapping suggests. No one cared particularly about Eichmann. The world was moving on. A Mossad agent on the case said it was left to a blind man living 10 hours away from Buenos Aires to prove Eichmann's identity. By then he was so down on his luck no one could believe a high-ranking Nazi fugitive could reside in so nondescript a place. Confronted by such a poor wretch his captors were \"touched, even a bit disgusted\" by his shabby underwear. In a way, the only person who cared by then about him was Eichmann himself. </p> <p>He was a willing captive, recognising that without trial he was nothing. His arraignment in Israel was the justification of a ponderous man eager to state his case, and the one unshakeable element in his defence was a capacity for self-justification. The element missing in Cesarani's compelling portrait is Eichmann the actor, the theatrical man who liked the uniform and the power it bestowed. In that one sees the historical destiny described by Primo Levi, who wrote of a man \"ringed by death\", surrounded by and selected by death just as the millions he had dispatched were selected for death. He joined them, willing but unrepentant, on May 31 1962, hanged in a makeshift execution cell.</p>",
  "British intelligence's extensive operations in the Balkans were thrown into disarray yesterday after a Croatian newspaper revealed the identities of several alleged British spies and claimed that the Croatian government had given MI6 agents carte blanche to wiretap and conduct undercover operations against Croatian citizens. <p>The weekly news magazine, Nacional, published the names of four British diplomats it described as important spies. Nacional's claim followed the recent unmasking by a Belgrade tabloid of the chief MI6 officer in Serbia, Anthony Monckton, who has just left the Serbian capital in what was seen as a blow to MI6's activities. Mr Monckton was then named by at least one British newspaper. </p> <p>Mr Monckton is said to have played an important undercover role in effecting the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague in 2001 and in the quest to find the assassins of Zoran Djindjic, the reformist Serbian prime minister murdered last year. </p> <p>\"Monckton was a very effective member of the British embassy in Belgrade,\" said a well-placed British source, who ascribed the outing of the alleged agents to \"rogue elements\" in the Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian security services who \"don't like the Balkans being cleaned up\" and who used the local media to pursue grudges. The tabloid published a full front-page picture of Mr Monckton and gave his private phone numbers. </p> <p>\"It's true that the British have been particularly active in the Balkans on the intelligence front. It's a backhanded compliment to be considered a British spy,\" said the source. \"There's usually a bit of fire in these stories.\" </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We never comment on intelligence matters.\" </p> <p>According to the article, MI6 put pressure on the Croatian prime minister, Ivo Sanader, to allow British intelligence to eavesdrop on Croats believed to be in contact with a Croatian war crimes suspect, General Ante Gotovina, threatening that Britain would oppose Croatia's bid to join the EU. </p> <p>Until April, the British government was the main block to Croatia's EU ambitions, citing the arrest of Gen Gotovina, the third most-wanted man on The Hague tribunal's list and the most-wanted Croat, as the condition for backing the EU bid. Gen Gotovina is still on the run, but Britain dropped its opposition in April when an EU summit invited Croatia to open membership negotiations. The British shift was officially said to be because Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor in The Hague, announced that the Sanader government was cooperating fully with the tribunal. Nacional alleged that the real reason was the green light given to MI6. Agents obtained from Croatian intelligence the names, addresses, and mobile phone numbers of individuals believed to be in contact with the fugitive general and also asked to tap land telephone lines. </p> <p>The magazine published a picture of a blue Bedford van with Croatian number plates, one of three said to have been brought into Croatia by British intelligence and bristling with monitoring equipment. </p> <p>Another British source attributed the Croatian allegations to hardline Gotovina supporters within the Croatian security services. \"The UK is the leading country pressing on Gotovina and some people here don't like it,\" he said. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Franjo Turek, the chief of Croatian counterintelligence, was fired by Mr Sanader after briefing government officials on alleged British intelligence operations. In July, another counterintelligence official, Damir Jukica, was fired after publicly criticising the Croatian cooperation with British intelligence. Zeljko Bagic, a former national security aide to President Stipe Mesic, alleged that British intelligence had recruited a number of prominent journalists in Zagreb and was planting disinformation on the Gotovina case in the Zagreb media. </p> <p>Mr Turek was said to have refused MI6's overtures. His replacement, Josko Podbevsek, was said to have cooperated fully. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Ivo Pukanic, the Croatian journalist who co-owns Nacional, was denied a visa to visit Britain next week.</p>",
  "<p>\"Russia look fabulous!\" sang the American Olympic official whose commentary was being transmitted through the tannoy system to a packed crowd. With camp commentary and jazz music the apparent accompaniment to this sport, he enthused: \"This race is beautiful!\". It was all getting quite emotional.</p> <p>Russia, in the C2 1,000m final, indeed looked impressive, their oarsmen powering them to lead the race from the halfway mark. But Germany looked strong - as they did in the K4s - and pulled out to snatch it at the finish.</p> <p>C2, K1, K4? What a complicated sport. Well, not really. Flatwater canoeing and kayaking is just racing boats over varying straight distances, the number next to the letter denominating how many oarsmen are in the boat.</p> <p>Canoes are open boats like the ones the Red Indians used in the old Hollywood films; oarsmen kneel on one leg, powering the canoe from an upright position. Kayaking means that you use one of those pointed vessels that you tend to see on canals, the rowers' legs are covered by the roof of the kayak and oarsmen get to use a double-bladed paddle.</p> <p>In fact it's all remarkably simple and, with a race taking place every fifteen minutes, it's a bit like a day trip to the dogtrack. Inbetween races the party music comes on and Brits and Germans and Poles all sing along to classics like The Beatles' \"Hard Day's Night\", bustling in and out of the stands to grab sandwiches and soft drinks.</p> <p>With a casual dresscode of bare chests and painted faces there is nothing Regatta or Henley about this boating occasion. Equally you do not need to be a member of the canoeing/kayaking hardcore to fit in.</p> <p>One British family, despite being disappointed by the British performances, were enjoying the entertainment in the sunshine: \"We've been seeing lots of different events and this has been great. Not like that dressage. My son went: he thought it was going to be horse racing. He said it was horses tap-dancing.\"</p> <p>The Slovakians practically tap danced as they climbed out of their four-man kayak to celebrate a hard-fought bronze medal, taking them to an overall 25th in the medals table. \"Ooh my goodness Slovakia\" cooed our canoeing commentator, \"This really is great.\"</p> <p>The sun shone down on the artificial lake at Schinias and the water sparkled in the bright light. A dramatic backdrop of mountains completed the picture as children waved flags and dropped ice-creams in the wobbly morning heat. Even some of the agitators from last night's women's football final were there, leaning on the railings for hungover support, swaying to the jazz and sipping on mineral water.</p> <p>The crowd craned their necks toward the large screens across the water for the final medal ceremony of the morning session. Germany had won Gold in the C2 1,000m final and the two athletes Christian Gille and Tomasz Wylenzek, who had come from behind to beat Russia, broke down in tears as they were presented with their medals. There is something about oarsmen and crying.</p> <p>The commentator gave no comment, but it was fabulous.</p>",

  "The alleged ringleader of the attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea was today convicted in a Zimbabwean court of attempting to possess dangerous weapons. <p>Simon Mann, 51, a former British SAS officer and old Etonian, had denied being a mercenary and claimed he was buying weapons in order to protect a mine in the Congo.</p> <p>The magistrate will deliver his sentences on September 10.</p> <p>The news will be watched with close interest by his friend Sir Mark Thatcher - son of the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher - who himself faces charges in South Africa in connection with the alleged plot.</p> <p>Most of the other 69 suspected mercenaries arrested with Mr Mann in March were today found not guilty by a magistrate sitting at a makeshift courthouse at Harare's maximum security Chikurubi prison. </p> <p>Sixty-six men, all travelling on South African passports, were found not guilty of violating Zimbabwe's immigration and civil aviation laws, according to Reuters; prosecutors dropped charges against two and could not say the fate of one other, the news agency reported.</p> <p>Mr Mann, a member of the Watney brewing family, was arrested with two colleagues near the runway while waiting for the arms to be loaded on a Boeing 727 carrying three crew and 64 former soldiers recruited in South Africa.</p> <p>During proceedings last month the marketing manager of Zimbabwe Defence Industries, Hope Mutize, told the court Mr Mann had approached him in February and paid a deposit on weapons worth $180,000 (\u00a3100,000).</p> <p>He said: \"According to him, he wanted to use the weapons to guard mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"</p> <p>But he indirectly linked Mr Mann to the alleged plot by saying he had been accompanied by a South African, Nick du Toit, who was later detained with 14 other men in Equatorial Guinea on suspicion of being the mercenaries' vanguard.</p> <p>Mr Mann was a member of the defunct mercenary firm Executive Outcomes. </p> <p>The supposed coup attempt was foiled on March 8 when 70 men were arrested after flying into Harare from South Africa and attempting to collect weapons. </p> <p>The Guardian revealed that a letter Mr Mann wrote from his Zimbabwe prison cell to his wife appeared to demand that his financial backers use their influence to get him released. </p> <p>In the letter, he appeared to suggest he was expecting $200,000 from Sir Mark - Mr Mann used the nickname Scratcher - for an unspecified \"project\".</p>",
  "<p>June was cold, the wettest in Britain for 100 years. At one point, it rained non-stop for more than 58 hours in London, the longest downpour ever recorded in the city. The result was severe flooding throughout the south-east. July, too, was miserable and August was \"exceedingly cool, wet and windy\" with strong gales, storm damage and a rotten harvest. Scotland shivered. </p> <p>This was not the lost summer of 2004, but of 1903, well before global warming was ever considered as even a minor player in the world's climates. </p> <p>There will always be freak weather and temperature and rainfall extremes, but what is extraordinary is that very wet summers such as those of 1903 or 2004, as well as intense heatwaves, storms and droughts, are coming thicker and faster as the world heats up. Ten of the past 14 years have been the hottest recorded, and this is linked by scientists to a rapid rise in levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere - which according to ice core samples tested in the Antarctic, are the highest in 440,000 years and still rising. </p> <p>Almost all climate scientists, atmospheric chemists and oceanographers say the greenhouse effect has arrived and that we should expect more droughts, hurricanes, flash floods, forest fires and giant storms. The kind of extreme weather that happened once in 100 years, they say, could soon take place every 20 years. </p> <p>There's plenty of evidence that 2004 is falling into this pattern. There have been major fires in southern France, California, Greece, Ireland, Nicaragua and Alaska, where five million acres have been burning. Drought is affecting large areas of east and southern Africa and there have been intense heatwaves in Spain, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. </p> <p>But 2004 may be remembered for its floods. Just eight months into the year, Bangladesh, and to a lesser extent India and Nepal, have had some of the severest seen in decades, with tens of millions made homeless. Less noticed have been major floods in Hungary, Vietnam, Kenya, Romania, Lagos, Nicaragua, Iran, Siberia, Bosnia and Papua New Guinea. Meanwhile, 17,000 people needed help after huge snowstorms in the Andes and Korea, and there were heavy falls in unlikely countries such as southern Greece, Jordan and Syria. </p> <p>Last week the European environment agency produced evidence that Europe was warming faster than expected and that the number of natural disasters had more than doubled in the past decade. Last year's pan-European drought cost 20,000 lives and billions of euros and the later floods affected at least 600,000. The agency, which said that most European glaciers were in fast retreat, warned people to expect more flash floods, mudslides, storms and droughts. </p> <p>Happily, fewer people have died as a result of extreme weather this year. Last year was one of the worst on record, with the Red Cross estimating that up to 700 \"natural disasters\" claimed 50,000 lives, almost five times as many as in in 2002. Heatwaves in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan took temperatures up to 50C (122F). In China floods along the Huai and Yangtze rivers swept through 650,000 homes. </p> <p>The economic cost of extreme weather is soaring. This month's Hurricane Charley caused \u00a310bn of damage in the US. Typhoons in China and Taiwan have also caused enormous losses. Last year's losses worldwide topped \u00a334bn. </p> <p>But the most unusual weather event in 2004 could have been the 90mph hurricane that hit Catarina in southern Brazil in March. Hurricanes have never been recorded in the southern Atlantic, because the atmosphere does not provide enough \"spin\" near the surface to get them started and winds higher in the atmosphere tend to shear off any that threaten to form. </p> <p>Whether it was a true freak of nature or what we can expect with global warming is hotly debated. Climate change scientists in Britain have predicted for some time that such unprecedented events in the south Atlantic would one day be a possibility. But few believed it would happen so soon.</p>",

  "<p>US scientists have pinpointed a new set of predators responsible for dwindling fish stocks - people who fish for fun.</p> <p>They report online in the journal Science today that recreational fishermen catch almost a quarter of the landings in the US of the overfished species such as red snapper, red drum and lingcod. In some places they catch even more than commercial operators. Almost 60% of red snapper landed in the Gulf of Mexico are hooked by amateurs. </p> <p>\"The conventional wisdom is that recreational fishing is a small proportion of the total take, so it is largely overlooked,\" said Felicia Coleman of Florida State University. </p> <p>In the Gulf of Mexico 64% of the landings of \"species of concern\" went to amateurs, and 59% along the Pacific coast. </p> <p>Will Figueira of Duke University, North Carolina, said: \"Recreational anglers are operating below the radar screen of management. While the individual may take relatively few fish, a few fish per person times millions of fishermen can have enormous impact.\" </p> <p>British sea anglers, however, are unlikely to take such a big bite out of the local catch. \"Although we think of Britain as a nation of anglers, it is predominantly for freshwater fish,\" said Callum Roberts, of York University. </p> <p>\"Of the marine fish, the problem is that there is not much left to catch in the waters around Britain. Fishermen used to catch a lot of cod and haddock and conger eel. Conger eels have declined dramatically and that kind of sport fishing is not as productive as it once was. </p> <p>\"Sea bass fishermen are doing a bit better because of the prohibition of commercial fishermen in the estuaries. In general, there isn't the same level of impact as in America,\" he said. </p> <p>\"In Florida if you take out a boat with 30 or 40 people on board and they are all fishing and they have a bag limit of say five of one species, you have fishing power there equivalent to any commercial fishing boat, and they can very rapidly eliminate the bulk of fish.\"</p>",

  "<p>This was supposed to have been the night when Kostas Kederis restored Greece to its rightful place in the sporting pantheon. The 77,000 seats in the Olympic Stadium had been sold out in double-quick time to Greeks hoping to see the man from Lesbos retain the 200 metres title he won so surprisingly in Sydney. </p> <p>His failure to keep an appointment with the dope-test squad two weeks ago, and his consequent withdrawal, appeared to have made him a martyr to the thousands who came to the stadium last night equipped with blue and white flags and a simmering resentment.</p> <p>They booed and whistled when the Kederis-less field was announced, and their chant of \"Hellas!\" delayed the start for five minutes despite entreaties from the announcer.</p> <p>When the gun finally went, after one false start, Shawn Crawford of the United States took Kederis's crown, leading home his team-mates Bernard Williams and Justin Gatlin in the second US clean sweep of a men's sprint final this week, following Monday's 400m. Only a silver medal for Francis Obikwelu of Portugal in the 100m denied the US a sweep of sweeps in the three individual sprints. Asafa Powell of Jamaica, who came to Athens as one of the favourites, failed to make the start last night. Crawford ran a personal best of 19.79sec, and Gatlin was unable to become the sixth US sprinter to achieve the 100-200 double.</p> <p>From the disgrace of Ben Johnson in Seoul to the withdrawal of Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou, the once glamorous business of Olympic sprinting has endured 16 years of steadily diminishing public esteem. The freakish world records set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988, Linford Christie's two positive tests, the Balco inquiry and the tarnishing of the reputations of Tim Montgomery, the 100m world record holder, and Marion Jones, his triple-gold partner, have all contributed to a pervasive cynicism concerning the achievements of the world's fastest human beings.</p> <p>In this the United States has set the tone, and the behaviour of their sprinters in recent years played a major role in accelerating the decline. Maurice Greene's wordless displays of bragadoccio and Jon Drummond's tantrums were merely the most obvious symptoms of a syndrome that led the US authorities to order the team as a whole not to indulge in exces sive celebrations in Athens. No doubt the message was aimed primarily at the sprinters.</p> <p>All this came as a sadness to anyone reared on tales of the dignity of Jesse Owens in Berlin, and on black and white television images of the Tennessee Tigerbelles, led by the immortal Wilma Rudolph, speeding to victory in the 4x100m relay in Rome. The antics of Greene and Drummond and their colleagues seemed an insult to the precious memory of Owens, Rudolph, Bob Hayes and Wyomia Tyus. When Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their proud and valiant protest in Mexico City in the turbulent year of 1968, they put the US sprint squad in the vanguard of social change. The pampered and preening bunch of recent years give the impression of being interested only in themselves.</p> <p>There have been signs of an improvement in recent days. Allyson Felix, an 18-year-old prodigy who graduated from high school this summer, took silver in Wednesday's women's 200m final in a way that suggested she will be a force to reckon with in all the sprint events in Beijing and beyond.</p> <p>Her coach's words, too, were heartening. \"There's a lot of work ahead,\" said the 60-year-old Pat Connoll. \"It takes time, especially if you're a woman and you're going to do it naturally.\"</p> <p>Dangerous to draw conclusions, of course, but the slender 9st frame of the 5ft 6in Felix looks very much like the product of doing it naturally. Born in Los Angeles to an elementary school teacher and an ordained minister who teaches New Testament Greek at a seminary in Sun Valley, Idaho, she has been a hot property for a couple of years. A six-figure deal with a shoe manufacturer includes her tuition fees at the University of Southern California.</p> <p>On Monday the stadium witnessed the birth of another, less heralded star when Jeremy Wariner, a 20-year-old Texan, led a US 1-2-3 in the 400m. Two things made Wariner's performance remarkable. The first was that he is the first white man to win the Olympic gold medal at this distance in a non-boycotted games since Mike Larrabee in 1964, something that was treated with relaxed humour and common sense by Otis Harris and Derrick Brew, the two African Americans who followed him home. \"Race has got nothing to do with it,\" Harris said. \"When people break down stereotypes, that's what athletics is all about.\"</p> <p>The second significant feature of Wariner's performance in all the rounds was the way he floated over the track with a beautiful fluency and economy, like a Seb Coe of the quarter-mile. He looks wonderfully light on his feet, but when Harris and Brew put the pressure on over the final stretch, he possessed the power to ease away.</p> <p>Wariner attends Baylor University, Michael Johnson's alma mater. He is coached by the veteran Clyde Hart, who was Johnson's guru, although Wariner's classical style could hardly be more different from Johnson's eccentric gait. Hart was pleased to tell those who asked that throughout his career he had believed an athlete's ethnicity to be an irrelevance on the track.</p> <p>Anyone who imagines that Wariner heralds a return to archaic values should note that his diamond ear studs make David Beckham's look undersized, and his small goatee and wraparound shades identify him as a member of the Eminem generation. But what US sprinting needed was someone to break the pattern. And when he and his team-mates compete in the four-lap relay today and tomorrow, they will, barring accidents, be providing the right kind of spectacle once again.</p>",
  "<p>Once, Lizzie Mickery tied a man to a hospital trolley and cut out his heart. She's stabbed a librarian in the throat with a pair of scissors and suffocated an asthmatic in a giant bag of laundry. She also wrapped a man in bandages and buried him alive. He later died. </p> <p>But Mickery does not reside in a hospital for the criminally insane, nor in a cave carpeted with human bones. She does write for television, however - a career that can end in institutionalisation or homicidal misanthropy, and sometimes both. As the writer of Messiahs I, II, and now III, Mickery is already au fait with murder: the classy serial-killer thrillers starring Ken Stott are synonymous with blood-spattered inventiveness and body counts that make John Webster look restrained. Even if, as Mickery says, \"you don't see as much as you think you do\", the Messiahs are still awash with suffering, both physical and psychological. They are, and make of this what you will, Event Television - opportunities for the whole family to sit round on a bank holiday and watch unsuspecting individuals have their throats slit at the opera or be barbecued to a blackened husk while hanging by a railway line. </p> <p>Messiah III is no different. Those with a fear of hospitals, confined spaces or both, will be particularly freaked. And as in previous instalments, you can't help but admire the killer's resourcefulness, especially when it comes to his/her employment of an MRI scanner. </p> <p>But the drama's most frightening moments don't involve any of the grand guignol thrills for which the franchise has become famed. Instead, it's the threat of a more real violence directed towards DS Kate Beauchamp (Frances Grey) that provides the real chill. Held hostage during a prison riot, Kate finds herself not just a lone woman among a band of brutal men, but also a symbol of the power that's imprisoned them. The prospect of gang rape is unavoidably intimated: Kate is passed between the men and has her mouth forced open with a phallic tool. She ends up offering herself to them with a pitiful, \"Anything you want ...\" It's a very upsetting scene. </p> <p>Mickery, you will have gathered, has no compunction about inflicting harm on her female characters. \"I suppose there would be specific things that would be worse if they happened to you because you're female, but the situation in which Kate finds herself, is because she's a police person. Maybe the audience will think it's worse because she's a woman, but I wrote her as I think any policewoman would like to be written - as somebody who goes in there to do a job. Why should she be left out of that just because she's female? I think that Kate would say that that was the risk she was prepared to take.\" </p> <p>Mickery says that she is gender-blind in her writing; as a female writer she has no more responsibility to her female characters than a male writer does. \"They are all characters to me. A lot of the best crime writers are women. If it was PD James or Elizabeth George, no one would think twice about it. So why is it that a woman writing television gets criticised?\" </p> <p>As detective drama goes, Messiah is at the more sophisticated end of the genre. Partly this is down to its hefty budget (\u00a31.1m an hour) and strong central performances. But it's also down to Mickery's knack for tapping into common fears. Many of her murders involve being trapped or restrained, and who hasn't had a nightmare about being buried alive? \"In Messiah, things do hurt,\" Mickery says. \"Everybody suffers - the team, obviously the victims, even the killer. It isn't one of those dramas where everything is lovely and fine after the killer is unmasked. The trauma endures.\" Finally, Messiah makes sense. You can, if you're so inclined, work out the logistics of the crimes; a fact of which Mickery is very proud. This separates it from, for example, the increasingly nonsensical, compulsively rubbish Waking the Dead. </p> <p>It's also good because Mickery is a good writer. She also wrote the superlative Sinners, BBC Northern Ireland's drama about the Magdalen laundries; Every Time You Look at Me, BBC2's love story about a disabled couple; and is co-writer of the upcoming Dirty War, a drama-documentary about the detonation of a dirty bomb in London. The latter was a departure for Mickery, who normally writes alone. \"Dan Percival, the man who brought you Smallpox 2002, had the idea long before I was involved, but after I got sent the documentation he had, I had to be involved: I thought it was an extraordinary subject. It had to be absolutely correct for obvious reasons, and we had a research producer and two research assistants working on it. Then, when it was time to write it, we sat down side-by-side and started from the beginning. Although it is very dramatic and, I hope, very engaging, it is a drama-documentary based on rigidly correct information.\" </p> <p>Once a jobbing actress, Mickery appeared in Tenko (\"I was last seen getting into a truck in Singapore\") and Juliet Bravo before getting a break after sending a script charmingly entitled Wankers' Doom to London's Bush theatre. That led to the production of other work, and to The Bill asking her to write for them. On the cop soap, she says, she learned discipline; the art of telling a complete story in half an hour. Writing for established characters was also the perfect training ground for a young writer. </p> <p>Running her two careers in tandem, Mickery went on to write and perform in, among other things, Heartbeat, before eventually giving up acting. \"As an actor,\" she says, \"you're playing everyone's parts in your head anyway, and writing is just the next stage, isn't it? You know what a script looks like and you know about tension, so you already have an advantage. I used - some might say abused - a lot of contacts I'd made, sending absolutely terrible scripts to script editors who read them and gave me feedback.\" </p> <p>She adapted the first of the Inspector Lynley Mysteries for BBC1, along with thrillers The Ice House and The Beggar Bride. She describes working on these as \"a whole other learning curve\". Her particular flair lies in creating characters you care about and stories that pull you along, almost magnetically. She's an attractive personality, too: very clever, witty, and slightly conspiratorial. The daughter of a vicar, she says she was acquainted with death at an early age, and maintains that her Yorkshire upbringing may have some bearing on her attitude to death. \"I think they're very realistic about death. It's not that they're hardened to it, but in difficult times, they maintain a sense of humour. After all, funerals can be very funny.\" </p> <p>Mickery says that she sees the possibilities of murder in various places, \"but that isn't to say I have a ghoulish or depressed outlook on life.\" She recalls growing up in Pudsey where, \"in the winter, they used to put wooden floorboards over the swimming pool and convert it into a dance hall. There was always a terrible moment when you realised you were dancing too energetically at what you knew to be the deep end and you'd think, 'Any minute now, I'm going to plummet to my death.' \" Suddenly, it all becomes clear. </p> <p>The latest instalment of Messiah is the last Mickery says she'll write. She's turning her attention to, among other things, a drama about the marines and a romance. Mickery catches herself and smiles. \"Though when you switch from Messiah to the romance, you do have to remind yourself not to kill anyone in the first five minutes.\" When you've had as much practice as Mickery, murder is a hard habit to break. Breaking hearts should be a breeze. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Messiah III: Death Pays All Debts, BBC1, August 30 and 31; Dirty War is on BBC2 in October.</p>",
  "<p>It's an enduring paradox of Jim Jarmusch's work as a writer-director that, even though his films may initially come across as a triumph of style over content, in the end it turns out to be a victory of content over style. Maybe it's the ultimate paradox of minimalism: the less your work does and is, the more these things matter. </p> <p>In Jarmusch's case, this means the very notions of hipness and independence that originally defined his stylish film-making in the 1980s - with Permanent Vacation (1980), Stranger Than Paradise (1984), Down by Law (1986), and Mystery Train (1989) - started working against his public profile in the 1990s, especially once being outside the mainstream started being regarded with greater suspicion. </p> <p>Furthermore, around the time of Jarmusch's Night on Earth (1992), released the same year as Reservoir Dogs, hipness and independence as values within American culture had become muddled and coarsened in the process of becoming mainstreamed. By then they were being used as advertising labels, and often deceptively. Thanks to Quentin Tarantino, being hip meant knowing all sorts of arcane facts about TV shows and Hong Kong action movies - a kind of pop culture one-upmanship that became all the more universal by being so democratic - while being independent meant allowing Miramax's Harvey Weinstein to decide what to cut from your own films. </p> <p>The crux of the matter, helped by corporate takeovers, was that niche markets existed only through the good graces of the mainstream, so that the Mecca of \"independent\" film-making became a film festival launched by a movie star and kept vital by Hollywood agents. Just as scoring at Sundance meant getting picked up by a studio, flourishing as an \"independent\" meant being distributed by Disney. </p> <p>In contradistinction to Tarantino, however, Jarmusch still owns the negatives of his features - with the exception of The Year of the Horse (1997), a documentary about Crazy Horse commissioned by Neil Young. Furthermore, after cutting a distribution deal with Miramax for his black-and-white western Dead Man (1995), he didn't allow Weinstein to make any changes - and suffered as a consequence when he saw his most ambitious film spitefully marginalised by its own distributor. </p> <p>But of course the film's mixed reception in the US also had something to do with its radical content. Its unforgiving, violent look at American greed and genocide was startling in its intensity, especially after the relatively laid-back charm of his previous features. A more politically oriented Jarmusch manner was taking shape, and it continued in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (2000) and now, even more unexpectedly, in Coffee and Cigarettes (2003). </p> <p>The first of these - which might be read as a kind of indirect, gentlemanly response to Tarantino - fancifully offers as its title hero a solitary black samurai (Forest Whitaker) in one of the New York boroughs, employed as a hitman by ageing small-time Italian gangsters. The second is a collection of 11 comic sketches in black and white - all set in American coffee-houses and adhering to certain minimalist rules of editing, camera angles, and decor (such as cuts to overhead shots of a circular checkerboard tabletop in each episode) - that Jarmusch started working on in 1986. </p> <p>Being a friend of Jarmusch for more than two decades, I can vouch for the fact that his increasing drift towards content wasn't intentional. It's a conscious tribute to his roots in New York minimalism that he cast two members of that downtown scene in the final episode of Coffee and Cigarettes - Taylor Mead and Bill Rice, Beckett-like lowlifes who played, often together, in underground films by Scott and Beth B, Robert Frank, Eric Mitchell, Amos Poe and Andy Warhol. But his wry observations about the ethics of celebrity in two other episodes - one with Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina playing themselves, the other with Cate Blanchett playing herself and her (fictional) resentful punk cousin Shelly - are clearly more intuitive and less inherited. They derive from Jarmusch's own ambivalence about being a recognisable underground figure, someone who can hardly walk a block in any major capital without being spotted. And they both speak volumes about the perverse processes of celebrity pecking orders across the planet. </p> <p>I don't mean to imply that ethical concerns are absent from Jarmusch's first five features - only that they tend more often to take a back seat to the behavioural comedy. It's worth adding that in Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law, the two films that established his reputation, this comedy often arose from unassimilated Europeans - Eszter Balint and Roberto Benigni, respectively - wandering with a couple of Americans through shifting black-and-white American landscapes that obstinately remained the same. The various cultural differences and mutual misunderstandings between the Europeans and Americans produced much of the dry humour, and Jarmusch was similarly fascinated with the spectacle of Japanese, Italian and English characters all converging in Memphis in Mystery Train. </p> <p>By the time he got to Dead Man, Jarmusch was discovering the same sort of cultural clashes between different kinds of Americans - specifically between a Cleveland accountant named William Blake (Johnny Depp) and a maverick Native American named Nobody (Gary Farmer). Comparable clashes abound in Ghost Dog, where the black samurai hitman and a black Haitian ice cream vendor (Isaach de Bankol\u00e9) can be best friends even though they can't speak a word of each other's language. It should also be noted that certain fantasy elements in Jarmusch's universe were by this time becoming more pronounced, partly because his use of Hollywood genres - westerns and hitman thrillers - were only emphasising his distance from certain mainstream assumptions. </p> <p>One of the darker implications emerging from all this was that you don't even have to be an immigrant in America to feel estranged from the general populace; tribal and cultural differences are more than enough - even though they can sometimes be transcended by personal bonds. (One of the more touching aspects of Ghost Dog is the way the title hero can share books and reading tastes, including Rashomon and Frankenstein, with a white gangster's moll and a black teenage girl.) More recently, this has been made apparent by the parallel outsized commercial successes in the US of The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 - both speaking directly to huge and mainly separate segments of the American populace that feel disenfranchised, and both made even more appealing by the scorn heaped on them in the mainstream media. </p> <p>I'm reminded of Harold Rosenberg's prescient observation about American life in The Tradition of the New (1959): \"Can it be that everybody is looking for a way to fit in? If so, doesn't that imply that nobody fits? ... Perhaps it is not possible to fit into American Life. American Life is a billboard; individual life in the US includes something nameless that takes place in the weeds behind it.\" In a Jarmusch film, one might say that weeds are always the natural habitat. </p> <p>A friend of mine who's been teaching film production in Chicago since the 1980s assures me that Jarmusch has almost invariably been the favourite film-maker of her Third World students, not Tarantino. I was reminded of this earlier this month when Thai filmmaker Pen-Ek Ratanaruang (Last Life in the Universe, 2003) explained that Stranger Than Paradise came as a major revelation, introducing him \"to another kind of mentality and taste; a taste very natural to me but which I didn't know\". </p> <p>I suspect this helps to account for the unexpected commercial success in the US of Coffee and Cigarettes - not a success on the level of a Kill Bill, a Fahrenheit 9/11, or a Passion of the Christ, but on the more modest level of a genuine independent such as Jarmusch who wants to speak from the margins. Yet the fact that he's about to shoot a new feature in colour with Bill Murray and other prominent stars also suggests he's willing to push the limits of those margins. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The Jim Jarmusch season is at the NFT, London, September 1-30.

  "<p>There's an empty packet of kettle chips and a half-drunk glass of Pimm's on the table, but Matthew Vaughn is nowhere to be seen. \"Hallo!\" he says brightly, and I spot him hiding in the corner of the room, posing awkwardly for the photographer, against a panelled wood door. We're in one of those agreeably over-stuffed rooms in a London hotel - a sort of library-cum-smoking room, all polished wood and dark walls. The double doors are open, and conversation drifts through from the next room.</p> <p>Vaughn is one of the most successful and well-known film producers in Britain, having earned his reputation on gangster movies such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, and the much-maligned Madonna vehicle, Swept Away. But scrape around for meat on Matthew Vaughn and one finds only the bare bones. He is the Little to the Large, his name perpetually tagged on to that of his partner in film Guy Ritchie, or to that of his wife, supermodel Claudia Schiffer. About Vaughn alone there is really very little.</p> <p>Today, Vaughn is wearing the most impeccable suit, with impossibly shiny shoes and twinkly cufflinks. Brown as a nut, and handsome in a rodenty way, he has the air of a Kenneth Grahame character. He isn't, he confesses, awfully well-versed in being interviewed. \"I didn't want to be famous. Sitting here now is not a comfortable thing for me, I can tell you that now. I'm quite happy if Guy can sit in the spotlight and I can stay in the shadows.\"</p> <p>The problem is that Vaughn has just directed his first film, Layer Cake, based on the novel by JJ Connolly, and it far out-shines anything he did with Ritchie. It is another gangster film, but more sophisticated than Lock, Stock or Snatch, starring Daniel Craig as a yuppie drug dealer seeking one final deal before taking early retirement. It's a very grown-up sort of film, with none of the vague slapstick quality of Lock, Stock and Snatch. \"We felt that the gangster movies had had their day, but no one had seized the crown of doing the new, real Get Carter or English Heat or Long Good Friday. A proper movie.\"</p> <p>\"It was very much serendipity,\" adds Vaughn, explaining how Layer Cake fell into his hands. \"Stephen Marks, who's the executive producer on Lock, Stock and on Snatch, rang me up and said, 'I've just read a great book you're gonna love. And it would make a great movie and it's perfect for the type of films you make.' And I said, 'Send it over, I'll read it.'</p> <p>\"Then I got on a train to go and watch the England-Germany football match in Belgium. On the way to the match - do you ever go to football matches?\" Vaughn does this quite a bit, rambling a little then suddenly flinging a question at you. I shake my head. \"Well, when you go to football matches, all the fans travel together, and people start talking to each other. And JJ Connolly was sitting opposite me, and we started talking - 'What do you?' - it's the first of three questions normally, and he said he was an author and he'd just written a book called Layer Cake. And I said, 'I think I've heard of it.' John's got a bit of an ego, so he said, 'Oh well, you will have heard of it. It's a really cool book, everyone's talking about it ...' and I said, 'Send me a copy, I'll read it.'\"</p> <p>When Vaughn returned to England after the football match, he was impressed to find a copy of Connolly's book already sitting on his desk. \"But it was the book sent by Stephen Marks. So that's when I went: OK, what are the odds?\"</p> <p>It took a further two years to negotiate the rights to Layer Cake, and by the time they had completed the script, Ritchie was engrossed in another project. \"He'd been working on a film called Revolver and he had the bug for doing that,\" says Vaughn. \"He wanted us to put it on ice, so maybe he could come back to it later. But by that stage I just felt ready.\" He decided to make Layer Cake his directing debut. \"I felt liberated to be by myself. I enjoyed every minute of it. It's the difference between riding a bicycle with stabilisers on and then taking them off. In a way I always felt I was conning myself and other people by being a producer. It wasn't something I felt natural about.\"</p> <p>Vaughn's entry into producing came in his gap year before university, when he was travelling around the world working in different Hard Rock Cafes. \"And then I got to LA. After a couple of minutes in LA you realise this town is about one thing and one thing only: film.\" He got a job as a teaboy for a director and swiftly decided that this was the world for him. He returned to Britain to start his degree in Anthropology and Ancient History at UCL, but jacked it in after three weeks and returned to LA, working there \"until I realised that so many people wanted to make films in the US that actually it's a bit freaky\". Vaughn decided the best strategy would be to come back to London to \"make a name for myself\" then return to Hollywood in a blaze of glory. \"That was the plan.\" He gives a little rueful smile. \"Not realising that we didn't have a film industry.\"</p> <p>He had produced one film, a little-seen short called The Innocent Sleep, by the time he was introduced to Ritchie. \"We had a mutual friend of a friend,\" he explains, \"and somehow Guy's script [for Lock, Stock] got to me. I thought it was fantastic, and I met him two days after reading it. We sat in a place in Soho, some coffee place, and had a cappuccino that neither of us could afford. There was that moment,\" he recalls, \"when the bill came, thinking who's going to pay for it?\" Despite the solo projects and the rumours that they have fallen out over Ritchie's involvement with the kabbala faith, the two remain friends.</p> <p>The move from producing to directing is not an easy one. Vaughn found that actors, especially, were hardly eager to work with him. \"I was a bit of a wild card, shall we say?\" He had to beg Craig to take the part (\"He turns quite a lot of things down, and he was so scared of it being Lock, Stock 3\"), adamant that he was right for the part. \"I truly think Daniel is one of the best actors of his generation,\" he says. \"Ironically, most of the time he does nothing in his performance - and it's very hard to do that on screen.</p> <p>\"Originally, when we were casting for the role, I said I was looking for someone that looks like Steve McQueen but has the charisma and the stillness of Clint Eastwood.\"</p> <p>Craig's composure is in stark contrast to the violent world he encounters. \"I really wanted to make sure the violence felt real in the film,\" says Vaughn. \"That it wasn't glamorised, it wasn't fun; that if someone gets beaten up it looks like it hurts. To put a conscience to it. I can't stand violence.\" The violence is indeed very graphic, but there is a strangely lyrical quality to it, due, in part, to the film's astonishing cinematography, which Vaughn says was inspired by the work of one of his favourite photographers, Andreas Gursky.</p> <p>Woman-of-the-hour Sienna Miller crops up, as a fleeting but extremely memorable sort of gangster's moll. \"I had to fight for Sienna because her agent wasn't sure she should do it,\" says Vaughn. \"My instincts said that she was going to be a big star. And I had no idea how quick the rise would be.\" We discuss Miller's newfound fame, largely built on the fact that she is Jude Law's girl friend. \"Hopefully she won't fall in that trap of being a celebrity more than an actress in people's eyes,\" says Vaughn.</p> <p>Vaughn's own brushes with celebrity have come through Ritchie's marriage to Madonna, and his own to Schiffer, with whom he now has a son, Casper, and another baby on the way. Though he claims that fame is not his \"goal\", he and Schiffer sold their wedding photos exclusively to Hello! magazine. \"That was a pure financial decision,\" he explains. \"We figured out how much it was going to cost to stop photographers getting in - we got a security quote of nearly \u00a3300,000. And Claudia's got a very big relationship with Hello! and we owed them one - they did something huge for us a couple of years beforehand.\" Three weeks before their wedding, Vaughn found himself in the tabloids when it was revealed that his father was not, as he had thought, the actor Robert Vaughn, but in fact George De Vere Drummond, an English aristocrat who is a godson of King George VI. \"It was a curve-ball,\" he says, with a little understatement. \"But I had more important things to worry about than what the press had to say.\"</p> <p>I ask him when he first realised that he was a successful film-maker, and that he could now date supermodels and afford as many cappuccinos as he pleased. He falls quiet. \"It's stumping me,\" he says eventually, \"because I'm still not believing everything - if that makes sense. I think the one time I've really felt 'This is real' was when we won the Bafta - the one voted for by the people. We beat Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare in Love - all these big movies. Standing up there on the stage looking out at all the industry, which I managed to diss in my speech.\" So certain were Vaughn, Ritchie and co that they would not win anything at the Baftas, that they arrived at the ceremony and set about getting drunk. \"We all stumbled up to the stage. I think there was eight of us, but for some reason no one wanted to speak and they pushed me towards the microphone - young and foolish and drunk.\" Looking down, Vaughn noticed that the entire front row appeared to be full of all the people that turned Lock, Stock down. \"And it just spurred me on. I said something like, 'I just want to thank the public because they're the only people that made this film a hit and not one person in this room helped us.\" He smiles. \"It was a weird moment - I'm normally the quiet one of the group.\"</p>"
