  "<p><strong>Destination Morgue, by James Ellroy (Century, \u00a317.99)</strong></p> <p>Much delayed, this is Ellroy's first book since The Cold Six Thousand in 2001, and will have to serve as a stop-gap for his rabid fans until the next instalment in his obsessive saga of \u00fcber-American crime. It collects 11 true crime articles and pseudo memoirs initially published in magazines and a splendidly perverted trio of new novellas featuring demented cop Rick Jenson, from 1983 to the present, as he tramples those mean LA streets underfoot to resounding effect in a forlorn quest for starlet Donna Donahue.</p> <p>All Ellroy's preoccupations are present: corruption, sex, violence, unsolved murders and excess by the dozen. As ever the results are as fascinating as a car crash, but then what would you expect with titles like \"Hollywood Fuck Pad\", \"Hot Prowl Rape-O\" and \"Jungletown Jihad\"? Truly radioactive lullabies for sick brains to be read at your own risk.</p> <p><strong>Answers from the Grave, by Mark Timlin (Do-Not Press, \u00a39.99)</strong></p> <p>Best known for his roisterous Nick Sharman Sarf London PI series, Timlin has finally written the book he's owed us for many years, and matures from his bad boy of Brit crime fiction cherished status to a level of surprising wisdom and acute social observation.</p> <p>Spanning several decades, this is a splendid evocation of crime south of the river, with a wide cast of villains, cops, drug traffickers and not so innocent victims that often brings to mind Coppola's Godfather movies. At twice the length of his previous novels, this is a rewarding saga in which every character has a place and a purpose, however crooked the path and every sudden, violent death feels like a blow to your sympathies. A dying crime lord, his adopted son, a cop killer, a reckless red-haired daughter, elderly acolytes past their criminal prime and revealing flashbacks to the characters' youthful days make this tale of revenge one of the best London crime books in ages. A writer has come of age.</p> <p><strong>Sunset and Sawdust, by Joe R Lansdale (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>Joe Lansdale is the poet laureate of the East Texas backwoods and this new semi-historical romp through dirt roads, deadbeat cops and unshaven villain land evokes the 1930s with the rawness and pungency of Steinbeck's California sagas set in the same period, albeit with a subtle murderous twist.</p> <p>Sunset's local constable husband has been shot at a sawmill camp and the grieving widow steps into his shoes to investigate a bizarre double murder, much to the dismay of the town's worthies, since she was the one who shot him. Gunmen and grifters, hobos and migrant workers, greed, corruption and malice stalk her path in what becomes a modern western with pace and energy to spare. Lansdale's previous foible for larger-than-life and bloodthirsty bizarros is muted this time around and might bring him a whole new readership, previously scared away by his colourful excesses.</p> <p><strong>London Bridges, by James Patterson (Headline, \u00a317.99)</strong></p> <p>Some writers are impervious to reviews and James Patterson has long held that rarefied status. However, the prospect of Alex Cross crossing guns again with two of his worst past foes, the Weasel and the Fox, and visiting London in the process was too much to resist.</p> <p>The book leaves me with mixed feelings. Patterson has left behind the crime genre and moved wholesale into international thriller mode, with terrorist attacks, Russian Mafia and assorted Arab foes, and the first half of the novel is a perfect lesson in pacing, slick anonymous writing and a labyrinthine plot unfolding in bite-size chapters. However, once you offer the reader Machiavellian villains, they have to play the part and not be apprehended so easily. Add twist upon final twist, which flop like a lead balloon, and you wish the author had been more thorough. A disappointment.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Maxim Jakubowski's new book Best British Mysteries Vol 2, 2005 is published by Allison &amp; Busby in November</p>",
  "<p><strong> Collected Poems</strong><br> by John James<br> 380pp, Salt, \u00a316.99 <br> </p> <p>John James is an extremely enjoyable and charismatic poet. His work is like a vigorous breath of fresh air, full of variety, humour and surprise. It has a strong sense of lyricism and energy, a striking mixture of the experimental and the immediate that brings to mind the work of Mayakovsky or the New York poets of the 1950s and 60s. There is also the presence of the Romantic poets running throughout his career, especially in the poems that celebrate the Welsh landscape. We see this in the early \"Exultation\", an adaptation of the 12th-century Welsh poet Hywel ap Owain Gwynedd, and in the brilliant \" . . . or as we wheel / down over Crickley\" with its wonderful opening lines. At his best James can sustain the kind of lyric flight that places him firmly in the tradition of the Coleridge of the \"Conversation Poems\" and the Wordsworth of the Two-Part Prelude: </p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\"...or as we wheel<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;down over Crickley, chivalrously high on our seats<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;you see across the gleaming generous screen<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;right to the Severn Valley, tawny with the broad<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;spread of distant grain, &amp; beyond<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;is where I'm going, where the mountains<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;put up their profiles &amp;, in the moister<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;air of that higher altitude, the woods &amp; valleys<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;will be deeply soft &amp; made greenly<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;vivacious again.\"</p> <p>James was born in Cardiff in 1939. He went to Bristol University, where he studied philosophy and English literature, then did postgraduate work in American literature at the University of Keele. He has spent many years living and teaching in Cambridge, more recently becoming head of communication studies at Anglia Polytechnic University. He has published poetry from the mid-60s onwards in books and pamphlets, from the extraordinary The Small Henderson Room (1969) and Striking the Pavilion of Zero (1975), through to the magnificent Berlin Return (1983) and Dreaming Flesh (1991). This Collected Poems from Salt not only gathers together these books into a single volume but also includes numerous pamphlets and sequences - Letters from Sarah, War, Poem for Bruce McLean, The Ghost of Jimi Hendrix at Stokesay Castle - that allow us to see the range and quality of material that James has been quietly and steadily producing. </p> <p>He is probably the most approachable of the experimental poets who, since the late 60s, have been associated with the idea of a Cambridge school. His directness and charm, his sense that experimentation can have both an urgency and a lightness of touch are very much to the fore throughout his work. His poems relish their vibrant sense of surface, their sudden and dynamic shifts of register and subject. They are constructed through a series of loosely and elusively connected lines, what James in his \"A Theory of Poetry\" calls at various points \"bands of alternating colour\" and \"crude broken ridges\". The poem is free to bring in a whole range of different materials and experiences sustained by a sensibility that is charismatic, humorous, tough, sexual, lyrical and elusive. As James says in the last section of the sequence \"Craven Images\", \"stay mysterious rather than be pure accept your multifariousness your pluralism\". The reader is kept in a state of energised suspense, floating over a constantly shifting series of lines, glimpsing possible narratives, possible events, before being whisked away in another surprising direction: \"24hrs ... &amp; the spider brushed against / your lovely adam's apple / as it descends over your sleeping / through Willis Conover &amp; again / in 1968 I'm left alone in sneezes / under the dusty beeches Martin / glimpsed through Collett's window / steaming in his impossible green rain-cape. Impossible / things French in English poems / are so, well, stale, like an old Paris Review / as it flops from your fingers goodnight\" </p> <p>One of the most successful poems employing this technique is \"The Dragon House\". Here James finds a way of effectively marrying the experimental and the Romantic impulses in his writing. The poem can be read as an updated version of Coleridge's \"Frost at Midnight\" or \"This Lime Tree Bower My Prison\" - it taps into the same kind of openness, intimacy, the same long meditative lines. There is an acceptance of the moment, of the here and now, in which fragments of domestic and sexual life are held within a politically and socially vital sensibility (\"a curious zeitgeist never far away\"). It is a marvellously judged encomium to the possibility of the good life: </p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\"her bright green leather high-heeled pumps<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;draws back the curtains to the sun &amp; coffee in bed<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;on trays with legs this windscreen of a morning<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;moving with beech &amp; yew a stewpond full of goldfish\" </p> <p>The energy of this opening comes from the subtle shifts in register and grammar, the way the lines (\"the bands of colour\") don't quite fit together. The \"high-heeled pumps\" of line one are clearly not the subject of the verb \"draws\" of line two. In the gaps (what James in his \"A Theory of Poetry\" describes as \"openings windows apertures leaks\") a whole range of possibilities are implied. This is a key part of James's success. He can suddenly open out immense and surprising perspectives. And in the next three lines he does this to great effect: </p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\"I would wish to attend to nothing more than that<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which is the measure of a lack of prayer<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;how could I be able to propose anything other?\" </p> <p>A celebration of the domestic moment swerves into a discussion about the absence of religion. There is a kind of exhilarating vertigo in the experience of reading these lines, a dizziness in the dramatic changes of focus. When we return to the intimate and the sexual, our sense of these details has been imbued with a very different range of reference - \"the way the ice melts all along your back / that soft declivity near your tail\". And James maintains this finely judged technique throughout the 79 lines of the poem. </p> <p>One of his most ambitious pieces of writing is \"Conversation\", published in Dreaming Flesh . It is ostensibly about the experience of climbing Mount Snowdon on August 19 1982 - \"stepping on quartz ... the horizon opening like a door, 600 feet to go\". But what makes this poem so extraordinary is the range of materials and themes that it manages to conjure. The poem is about optimism under duress, about the capacity to maintain hope in the face of difficulty and collapse. It taps into various levels of public and personal utterance (from the lyrics of Bryan Ferry to the language of revolutionary change). Part of the poem's success is that it is implicitly drawing a parallel between the political optimism of the late 1960s and that of the 1790s. The Coleridge of \"Fears in Solitude\" is looking over the poet's shoulder as he climbs. It ends with an impassioned and defiant flight, a eulogy to the potentially restorative qualities to be caught in language itself: </p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\"keep looking up!<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;with what strange utterance does the rushing air<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;blow though my floating head the sky &amp; motion of the cloud<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;no light above the levels of the mist &amp; biting hail<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;glimpse of a familiar figure by the brook<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I see the millions I catch the language<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which is the world of all of us<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;this only place in which we find our happiness or not at all<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the end\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Charles Bainbridge works at the Poetry Library on London's South Bank.</p>",
  "<p>There's no getting away from Robert Frank. His influence has been felt even by people who have never heard of him or seen his landmark book The Americans. And yet, as Frank's forthcoming retrospective at Tate Modern illustrates, that book is just part of more than half a century's creative endeavour. As with Philip Roth, a considerable part of Frank's ongoing effort has been about the effects of early success. Living in the wake of his legend has been a source of dissatisfaction and resignation, as well as a goad.</p> <p>He periodically waves goodbye to photography before grudgingly and lovingly coming back to it. Even he finds it hard to get away from himself, to get away from the long aftermath of The Americans. One way of doing so is, paradoxically, to turn the tables on the exhibition's extended aim and range and zoom in on that one crucial part, to look at The Americans as though its importance were not assumed, to approach it as though our vision had not already been formed by it.</p> <p>Frank was born in Zurich in 1924. In his late teens and early 20s he was apprenticed to a number of Swiss photographers. On his first trip to America in 1947, he was hired as a fashion photographer by Harper's Bazaar but quickly jumped the style ship to go travelling and photographing in Peru and Bolivia. For the next few years he flip-flopped between Europe and America, where, in 1953, he met Walker Evans, whose book American Photographs (1938) had comprehensively mapped and defined its twin subjects (America and photography).</p> <p>The two men went on road trips together. Evans would ask Frank to stop the car, would walk to a spot a hundred yards away and come back and say that tomorrow the sun would be in the right place at a certain time and they should return then. Frank stayed in the car.</p> <p>With Evans's encouragement, Frank applied for a Guggenheim grant so that he could travel through America and take photographs of \"the kind of civilisation born here and spreading everywhere\". Accompanied by his wife and two kids, Frank set off in 1955, photographing - as Jack Kerouac wrote in the introduction to the book that resulted from this trip - \"practically 48 states in an old used car\". As on those jaunts with Evans, he sometimes stayed in the car - even while he was taking photographs. And he didn't bother to wait until tomorrow, when the sun would be in the right place.</p> <p>\"I love to watch the most banal things,\" Frank has said, \"things that move.\" Many of the pictures - even those taken from a stable, fixed spot - look like they were taken on the move. America was becoming a place to be seen from a car, a country that could be seen without stopping. In Frank's pictures, it is as if the camera only just succeeded in stopping time. And even then we are always being urged on. The pictures are apparently so casual as to seem hardly worth dwelling on.</p> <p>If we linger, it is often to try to work out why Frank took a particular picture - what's so special about this? A neon arrow on the side of a building directs us beyond the edge of the page to the next photo. The purpose of the photograph made from a hotel window in Butte, Montana, is to confirm that the view - partly hindered by net curtains - does not merit a second glance. (As such, the photograph demands that we return to it again and again.) An elevator door is about to close, like a shutter that will open again, for a moment, not on another floor but in another building or another city (though which one - and why - is anybody's guess).</p> <p>The sense of being constantly in motion contributes to what has often been remarked on: the grim, bleak quality of Frank's pictures. But there is also a snatched, self-cancelling lyricism, a grainy yearning that never quite has the opportunity to manifest itself fully. Articulating something similar, John Cheever confided to his journal that \"this nomadic, roadside civilisation [was] the creation of the loneliest travellers the world has ever seen\". Unlike Kerouac - who considered Frank's view of urinals \"the loneliest picture ever made\" - Cheever did not have Frank or any other photographer in mind when he wrote this; but his \"vision of the waywardness of man and the blessings of velocity\" serves as a sidelong commentary on a world glimpsed and preserved in The Americans.</p> <p>Despite Evans's enthusiastic support, Frank's perceived indifference to traditional ideas of visual composition was so challenging that at first he could not find an American publisher for the book. It was only after its successful publication in France in 1958 that The Americans was released in the States the following year. The year after that, Ornette Coleman released an album that boldly announced The Shape of Jazz to Come. Though occurring independently of each other, these defining moments in music and photography are mutually illuminating.</p> <p>The history of jazz is the history of listeners growing used to what at first sounds alien. Frank's pictures share with Coleman's music the need to explore formal boundaries by doing away with them. The objections to the free jazz ushered in by Coleman can easily be carried over to Frank, whose work was judged, by traditional standards, to be unframed, uncomposed. In the late 1950s Coleman's music was revolutionary and unprecedented. Listening to it now we can hear, quite clearly, that it is drenched in the blues that the saxophonist had heard growing up in Fort Worth, Texas.</p> <p>It's the same with Frank. Since his pictures have themselves become part of a tradition, we can see how they have come directly out of an earlier phase of that tradition. However unprecedented, there is usually something familiar about Frank's photos, some vestige of an earlier, safer pictorial logic whose packaging has been deliberately discarded.</p> <p>What makes Frank unique, according to Wim Wenders, is an ability \"to take pictures out of the corners of his eyes\". The results of this skill are not easy on the viewer's eye but, having become accustomed to this uneasiness, we can see how much of the earlier visual blues of Dorothea Lange and Evans is there in Frank. On US 91, the road out of Blackfoot, Idaho, he photographs a pair of people in their car, in profile, driving into the future with all the fixed determination of purpose of the Okies memorialised by Lange.</p> <p>Frank's consciousness of treading, both thematically and geographically, in the footsteps of his predecessors is highly developed. The idea was not to passively record how America had changed in the 20 years since Evans and Lange documented it in the 1930s but, more actively and challengingly, to look at how photography might be changed for the next 20 or 30 years - maybe more.</p> <p>It was this - the fear of the visual deluge that might come in his wake - as much as what Frank actually did that troubled people. It was wholly fitting for Kerouac to write the introduction to The Americans - the questions the Beats prompted a horrified Gore Vidal to ask himself were exactly those posed by Frank.</p> <p>\"Was this what writing was destined to be - an endless report on what one had done the night before while listing the names of the all-alike towns that one sped through on the ever-same road?\" Kerouac had already worked out his own answer. Having dismissed the material of Fitzgerald as \"sweetly unnecessary\" he went on to inform Neal Cassady that it \"is the exact stuff upon which American Lit is still to be founded\". That was in 1950.</p> <p>Frank's own answer - visual rather than verbal - was that, in some respects, he was travelling down the ever-same road as Lange and Evans. But, in doing so, he was not just observing how what is seen from and on the road has changed; he was actively bringing about a change in perception. (The irony is that Evans's American Photographs had done exactly the same thing in the 1930s; it is a task that must be perpetually renewed.)</p> <p>The easiest way to gauge the extent to which Frank succeeded in this aim is by jumping ahead a few years to 1967, to a seminal exhibition, New Documents, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. According to the curator, John Szarkowski, the show described a shift from documentary photography \"in the service of a social cause... towards more personal ends\".</p> <p>Comments by two of the three featured photographers reveal how important Frank had been in bringing this transition about. Diane Arbus noticed \"a kind of hollowness in his work\". \"I don't mean hollow like meaningless,\" she explains. \"I mean his pictures always involve a kind of non-drama... a drama in which the centre is removed. There's a kind of question mark at the hollow centre of the sort of storm of them, a curious existential kind of awe. It hit a whole generation of photographers terribly hard, like they'd never seen that before.\"</p> <p>For his part, Garry Winogrand (who undertook his own photographic trek across America in 1964) was transfixed by a photo of a gas station that Frank had taken near Santa Fe, New Mexico. It's a picture of five \"Shamrock\" gas pumps against a nondescript landscape. Looming over the pumps is a sign with the letters S A V E illuminated and the intervening ones - G A S - barely visible. That's all there is, but, for Winogrand, the fact that it's \"a photograph of nothing\" - that \"the subject has no dramatic ability of its own whatsoever\" - makes it \"one of the most important pictures in the book\". There's actually no sign of life: no houses, no windows, no cars. Even the road is quite hard to see.</p> <p>It is perhaps the most extreme example of the hollowness or non-drama - \"a drama in which the centre is removed\" - that Arbus had noticed, in that this absent centre extends to the very edges of the frame. Frank had a fondness for what he called \"in-between moments\"; in this instance, though, the in-betweenness has been extended, like the road in the middle distance, indefinitely.</p> <p>What amazed Winogrand was that Frank could \"conceive of that being a photograph in the first place\". Its capacity to amaze is undiminished even now, almost half a century after it was taken. But it's Winogrand's more general claim that gets to the heart of Frank's achievement; he didn't just take remarkable photographs; he changed our conception of what a photograph could be.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robert Frank is at Tate Modern, London, from October 27 to January 30.

  "<p>Bitter Fruit, by Achmat Dangor (Atlantic Books, \u00a37.99) </p> <p>Dangor's satire of a South Africa where political miracles warp into banal management and \"apartheid's astronauts\" are still stuck in the townships, is an intoxicating read. Set in a suburb of Johannesburg at the end of Mandela's presidency, this Booker-shortlisted novel builds up to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, while plotting the disintegration of a family fractured by a rape that took place 20 years earlier. Formerly a terrorist member of the ANC, Silas is a lawyer liaising between the Ministry of Justice and the TRC. He runs into Du Boise, the Afrikaner policeman who assaulted his wife Lydia - and impregnated her with the cruel seeds Dangor scatters in a heady text where sex is by turns political, subversive and spectacularly jubilant. The scars of the past become living demons, particularly for son Mikey, who returns to the Soweto mosque where his grandfather was imam. Utterly compelling. <strong>SA</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A Brief Stay with the Living, by Marie Darrieussecq (Faber, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>Hailed as one of France's most original voices, the author of Pig Tales maps a day in the life of a mother and her three grown-up daughters, tracing the quirks and queries, excruciating memories and slow-time present that comprise the dislocated thought patterns in her \"cast of voices\". Piecing together these fragments, we learn that the mother lives in the south of France with her disfigured boyfriend and youngest daughter. Meanwhile, Jeanne, the eldest, has lugged her guilt around the world to wind up in Buenos Aires where she's trying to get pregnant, Anne lives alone in Paris and John, the father, buries his energies in wind turbines in Gibraltar. The characters' minds inter-splice to the point where one can dream the impending doom of another. From tango to torture and roses to synaesthesia, Darrieussecq's eclecticism ebbs towards self-indulgence before surging back with another blaze of insight. The ending is a brilliantly understated coup de th\u00e9tre.<strong>SA</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Discovery of Slowness, by Sten Nadolny (Canongate, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Sten Nadolny's portrayal of John Franklin, the explorer and \"man who ate his boots\", starts out so slowly he can't catch a ball. It even takes him a moment or two to begin to weep. \"When I tell something, sir, I use my own rhythm.\" This patient rhythm comes to be inscribed as \"Franklin's system\". It sees the future captain join the navy and fight at Trafalgar before turning to the unhurried, frozen wastes of Arctic exploration where he ends up buried in pack-ice. Unsurprisingly, the prose takes a while to get going, but you gradually warm to it. If Nadolny taps into the zeitgeist of ascribing \"syndromes\" to past luminaries, he undoubtedly strikes a chord with pacifists, anti-fast-foodies and opponents of \"the ominous acceleration of the present time\" alike. \"I have learned to look stupid up until the moment they see I am smart, or, even better, until others seem more stupid than me,\" explains Franklin. \"Do you believe me?\" Well, some of the time.<strong>SA</strong></p> <p> <strong> Bethany Bettany, by Fred D'Aguiar (Vintage, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Poor Bethany Bettany: conceived in an aeroplane toilet and promptly returned to fend for herself in her grandparents' home in Guyana. D'Aguiar presents a bewildered young girl condemned to be treated like a punchbag for no greater crime than resembling her mother. If the evocation of these beatings seems coldly repetitive (some sadistic, belt-wielding uncle heaves into view every five pages or so) and maybe just a little pruriently lingered over, it's probably to inure the reader to their effects, much as Bettany copes by pretending to be invisible. The jacket encourages one to perceive Bettany's bruises as a metaphor for her country, which feels like an onerous load for a slender-framed girl to bear - and you do begin to wonder about the importance of the political activity which detains Bettany's mum from coming to her rescue. But it could just be D'Aguiar's way of saying that the pains of childhood seem to go on for ever. <strong>AH</strong></p> <p> <strong> Our Lady of the Forest, by David Guterson (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>The sighting of a virgin in the trailer-park wilderness of North Fork is cause for great excitement, as there aren't many virgins left in this atrophying enclave of American logging country. But one wet November a stick-thin, sickly mushroom-picker called Anne Holmes reports an unexpected encounter with the Madonna in a soggy glade, and pandemonium ensues, with rustic fanatics and an attendant train of wolfish trinket-sellers tramping across private forestry land \"like Hieronymus Bosch on Budweiser\". As Anne is a homeless waif with a history of recreational drug abuse, it's up to the local priest to determine the veracity of her claims. Divine manifestation or dodgy mushroom? Guterson makes a bravura display of keeping the reader guessing, while charting the underlying erotic charge between consumptive visionary and celibate priest which threatens to derail the whole process altogether. <strong>AH</strong> </p> <p><strong>Staying Alive, by Matt Beaumont (HarperCollins, \u00a310.99)</strong> </p> <p>Here's a telling statistic: try typing \"tits\" into a search engine and you get 3,199,658 matches. But enter the word \"cancer\" and there are more than 18 million sites. Middle-ranking advertising executive Murray has cause to contemplate these figures following the discovery of a large growth in his testicles. Given the prospect of only four months left to live, he decides to dedicate the time to \"unleashing his inner Jimi Hendrix\", which, if not quite on the level of simulating cunnilingus on a guitar, at least means trying to persuade his ex to move back in with him and telling his tedious corporate paymasters where to get off. The story of a repressed bloke alphabetising his album collection while pining for a trendy lawyer girlfriend to come back to him was comprehensively covered in Nick Hornby's High Fidelity; but Beaumont is an unflaggingly funny writer with a great facility for teetering on the edge of credibility and coming down on the correct side.

  "Most Australians don't like George W Bush, and their opinion of the US has deteriorated during his term as president - and we are not alone. A ten-country survey of attitudes to the US shows that Australia is right on average in its reaction to Mr Bush and his America. <p>Australians would prefer to see the Democrat alternative, John Kerry, prevail in the November 2 election by 54 per cent to 28 per cent. This is in near-perfect alignment with the average of opinion in the ten-country sample - the average is 52 per cent for Senator Kerry compared to 28 per cent for Mr Bush.</p> <p>If the citizens of these ten countries were electing the next US President, Mr Kerry would be elected by seven and only two, Israel and Russia, would re-elect Mr Bush.</p> <p>We are not anti-American.

The US President is still the leader of the free world, yet the free world is less inclined to approve of him.</p> <p>The survey, sponsored in Australia by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age and conducted by ACNielsen, was sponsored by a major metropolitan daily newspaper in each of the ten nations.</p> <p>In a separate exercise - three series of surveys conducted across 44 countries by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre - the turning point in world attitudes to the Bush administration was found to be the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>Australians have an unfavourable opinion of Mr Bush in the ratio of two to one - 64 per cent compared to 32 per cent who say they have a favourable opinion of him.

  "The European Union is to ban all European companies from investing in Burmese firms controlled by or linked to the military dictatorship in Rangoon, senior Dutch diplomats said last week. <p>In a package of sanctions planned by the EU against the regime in Burma, foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg this week, will also vote against extending any loans to the country from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. </p> <p>Speaking as leaders from 38 coun tries gathered in Hanoi for the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit, Thom de Bruijn, the Dutch EU ambassador, said the failure of the Rangoon authorities to respond to EU demands for reforms on democratic and human rights, including freeing opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, meant there was no choice but to impose sanctions. </p> <p>In August the Burma Campaign UK published a \"dirty list\" of 95 companies directly or indirectly helping to finance the regime, including Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker, operating through a Singaporean subsidiary, and Lloyd's of London. </p> <p>Others, including British American Tobacco, accountants Pricewaterhouse Coopers and advertising group WPP, have ended their involvement in the past year, the campaign said. </p> <p>Amid misgivings about how the sanctions will be policed, ministers will prohibit EU-registered companies from making financing available to Burmese state-owned firms, including banks and manufacturers. One aim is to enable Burma's neighbours, such as Thailand, to exert more pressure on Rangoon. </p> <p>The EU is concerned that the sanctions hit the military authorities and their \"cronies\" in state-run firms rather than the Burmese people but there is scepticism this can be achieved. \"It is not our intention to take sanctions that would hurt the population,\" Mr de Bruijn said. </p> <p>But ministers, who will expand a visa ban list to include all Burmese military officers above the rank of brigadier-general, will increase aid for health and education after consultations with local democratic groups, including the National League for Democracy headed by Ms Suu Kyi. </p> <p>According to British campaigners, imports from Burma have more than tripled since Tony Blair came to power, reaching $110m last year.</p>",
  "It is an unquestioned axiom that has dominated international politics for decades, a shibboleth undented by the passage of time. We live in an overcrowded world teeming with billions of humans who are destined to suffocate our cities and squeeze our planet of its precious resources. <p>Our future is destined to be nasty, brutish and cramped. Or is it? Population analysts have suddenly started to question the \"self-evident\" truth that we are destined to drown under our own weight. Yes, populations will still rise, but not nearly as steeply as once feared or for so long. We can even envisage the day, in the not too distant future, when they will decline. </p> <p>As evidence, statisticians point to a simple, stark fact: people are having fewer and fewer children. In the 1970s global fertility rates stood at about six children per woman. Today the average is 2.9 - and falling. Such a rate will still see the world's population rise to 9 billion by 2050, an increase of 50% on today's figure. That is not good news for the planet, but it is far less alarming than the projections of 15 billion that were once being made. More to the point statisticians predict that, after 2050, the number of humans will go down, the first major long-term fall since the Black Death. </p> <p>As sociologist Ben Wattenberg states in his book, Fewer: How the New Demography of Depopulation Will Shape Our Future : \"Never in the last 650 years, since the time of the Plague, have birth and fertility rates fallen so far, so low, for so long, in so many places.\" </p> <p>So the urging by the British trade secretary, Patricia Hewitt, that it is now the patriotic duty of the nation's women to have children makes some sense. As she told the CBI last month: \"We won't have a workforce if people do not have children.\" </p> <p>She has a point. By 2050 we will have stopped replacing ourselves with enough youngsters. At present the median age of people on this planet is 26; within 100 years, if current trends continue, that will have doubled. More and more old people will have to be supported by fewer and fewer young people. Populations will go down and also become badly unbalanced. Today 10% of the world's population is 60 years or over, a figure set to rise to more than a third by 2100. </p> <p>Such trends raise two key questions. Why has the rise in world populations started to die out so dramatically? And what will be the consequences of this decline? </p> <p>Answers to the first depend on locality. \"In Europe, women have their own career options,\" said Ros Davies of Interact Worldwide, which campaigns on population issues. \"They are no longer considered failures if they do not acquire husbands and produce children in their 20s or 30s; they are judged by their careers. That has taken a substantial number out of the pool of potential mothers.\" </p> <p>The idea that prosperity discourages childbearing is backed by Wattenberg: \"Capitalism is the best contraception.\" Hence Europe's birth rate, which varies from 1.8 per woman in France and Ireland to 1.2 in Italy and Germany. Britain comes in at 1.7, well above the average of 1.4. However, given that a country needs a birth rate of 2.1 to maintain its numbers, it is not hard to see that in the long term there are likely to be far fewer Europeans. By the middle of the century western Europe's population could be dropping by several million a year as today's young adults reach old age, die, and are not replaced. </p> <p>The causes of declining numbers in other countries are more alarming. Russia's population is dropping by almost 750,000 people a year. The causes are alcoholism, breakdown of the public health service and industrial pollution that has had a disas trous effect on men's sperm counts. </p> <p>In China the state enforces strict quotas of offspring numbers and it is expected that its population will peak at 1.5 billion by 2019 then go into steep decline. Some analysts suggest the country could lose 20%-30% of its population every generation. </p> <p>Then there is the exodus from the countryside, a trek happening across the globe. According to UN figures last month, half the world's population will have urban homes by 2007. But in cities a child becomes a cost rather than an asset for helping to work the land, and again pressures mount for people to cut down the size of families. </p> <p>Other countries with birth rates below replacement level include Australia, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico and the industrial \"tiger\" nations of southeast Asia such as Singapore and Taiwan. On the other hand there are still nations - mainly in Africa and the Middle East - where fertility rates remain high. According to the UN, the population of the Middle East will double over the next 20 years. Saudi Arabia has a fertility rate of 5.7; in Yemen it is 7.2; in Palestine 5.9. More surprising is the case of Africa. Despite Aids, which kills millions of young Africans every year, population numbers will continue to rise - except for a band of Mediterranean nations, including Libya and Egypt, and South Africa at the other end of the continent. </p> <p>The impact of all this is harder to gauge. Slight population movements are relatively easy to deal with; huge fluctuations pose serious problems. In Europe demographers forecast a major drop in the numbers who will work and earn money, while the population of older people - who need support and help - will soar. In China the problem is worse. Most young Chinese adults have no brothers or sisters and face the prospect of having to care for two parents and four grandparents on their own. Pensions and incomes are simply not able to rise fast enough to deal with the crisis. </p> <p>Reduced human numbers can only be good for the planet in the long term. Until we halt our spread, the destruction of the last great wildernesses, such as the Amazon, will continue.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago Analia Brizuela, a cycling enthusiast, was one of 2 million young Argentinians struggling to find work; now she runs a successful cycle tour company in the popular tourist city of Salta, in the north of the country. The entrepreneurial 32-year-old is the beneficiary of a new and growing trend in corporate philanthropy: business mentoring. </p> <p>For years, large companies have sought to salve their consciences by writing big cheques to charitable causes, but increasing attention is now being paid to the \"soft skills\" that business people can bring to social programmes. </p> <p>\"Business mentoring of entrepreneurs is a highly effective way of transferring business people's experience and knowledge to young people who are needing help,\" enthuses Richard Street, director of the UK-based mentoring initiative <a href=\"http://www.youth-business.org\"> Youth Business International </a>.</p> <p>He seems to be on to something: the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) last week announced a \u00a32.4m grant to establish a network of mentoring initiatives across Latin America. The bank hopes the scheme, which aims to recruit 1,800 business people, will lead to the creation of over 3,000 small businesses like Analia's.</p> <p>The IABD investment, which is matched by cash and in-time funding from the private sector, will be used to pilot programmes in four countries: Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. Through the schemes, young entrepreneurs will receive advice on core business skills such as preparing a business plan and conducting market research. They will also be able to access small loans to cover start-up costs. </p> <p>The methodology owes much to the work of the UK youth charity the <a href=\"http:// www.princes-trust.org.uk/\"> Prince's Trust</a>. Set up by Prince Charles in 1976, the trust's mix of mentoring expertise and loan finance helps around 4,000 disadvantaged young people set up their own businesses every year. </p> <p>For young entrepreneurs, the benefits of an experienced mentor during the start-up phase of a business are obvious, in terms of specific skills and networking opportunities and more general managerial advice and encouragement.</p> <p>For example, Natalie Melton, the 32-year-old chief executive of a new Liverpool-based social enterprise, Weston Spirit Trading, places considerable value on the commercial perspective of her mentor, from the Conran restaurant group. </p> <p>\"My mentor is giving me very practical support in terms of finance and strategy, but he also provides me with a great sounding board for some of the challenges that I'm facing,\" she says.</p> <p>Natalie's mentoring partnership is brokered through the Partners in Leadership with Community programme, which matches senior business executives with community and social enterprise leaders. </p> <p>The scheme is run by the non-profit organisation Business in the Community (BITC) and is partly funded by the Department for Trade and Industry's Social Enterprise Unit.</p> <p>The benefits from mentoring are not all one way, however. </p> <p>BITC's spokeswoman, Emma Price-Thomas, is keen to stress the gains for mentors. Business participants often report improvements in their own management skills as well as opportunities for alternative ways of working, better understanding of customer needs and access to new networks. \"It takes them out of their comfort zones and makes them see things in a different way,\" she says. </p> <p>John West provides a case in point. As deputy news editor at the Coventry Evening Telegraph, he recently mentored Clare Wightman of Grapevine, a project for people with learning difficulties in the city. \"Working with Clare has opened my eyes to an aspect of city life that I had little appreciation of,\" he says. \"Thinking of ways to reach and involve more Grapevine users has given me ideas for my own reader involvement project.\"</p> <p>Such benefits are crucial if business mentoring is ever really going to take off. If large companies are to give time off to highly paid senior managers, some degree of commercial return must be expected (by shareholders if no one else). </p> <p>Mentoring advocates will point to positive organisational spin-offs such as staff development, employee morale and enhanced community profile. </p> <p>Craig Cohon is one such enthusiast. The former senior Coca-Cola executive is the brains behind Stretch, an executive training programme that takes high flyers from the private sector and places them on mentor assignments with inner-city entrepreneurs. </p> <p>Describing the programme as a hands-on alternative to an MBA, he argues: \"It costs less and it's based on practical learning, not theory.\" With a client list that includes Cadbury Schweppes, Vodafone, BT and the Bank of England, Cohon is certainly succeeding in making his case heard.</p> <p>Identifying clear business benefits from mentoring is not the only hurdle that this new form of corporate community involvement will have to cross: differing levels of economic development, business skills and cultural expectations will all influence take-up around the world.</p> <p>However, Dr Carol Homden of the Prince's Trust believes the UK could be trailblazing a new trend for international corporate community involvement. She says: \"There is no reason in principle why the experience in the UK, which has resulted in 60,000 young people over the last 21 years starting their own business, should not be used to the benefit of other young people in other countries.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Balch is managing editor of the bi-monthly journal <a href=\"http://www.ccbriefing.co.uk\">Corporate Citzenship Briefing</a></p>",
  "What is there to say about the Labour conference? It confirmed that I cannot vote for Labour while Tony Blair is party leader. I expected the conference to be carefully stage-managed and anodyne - and it was. Even the protests in the hall were predictable - a lone antiwar protester (who, we were informed, was not only a Trotskyite but a known protester, whatever that means) and more of those enterprising hunting supporters - or were they the same ones again? <p>Brown's annual \"I'm really very, very Labour\" speech has begun to look ritualistic, while Blair's speech was, predictably, an exercise in vapid manipulation. The columnists tell us that rather than hectoring \"his\" party, he took a more conversational line. It struck me as having all the faux intimacy of a chat over a mug of lukewarm Gold Blend on a daytime TV sofa. Contrast that with the volley of stun-grenade announcements about 10 seconds after the conference ended.</p> <p> Bam! \"I'm going on\" (and on). Bam! \"I've bought a big house to show that I'm only going on and on, not on and on and on.\" Bam! \"I know these announcements are going to piss you off, so I've arranged a bit of heart surgery so you have to rally round me regardless.\" Odd that he tells the TV all this, not the conference - remember the cosy chat he was having? A perfect opportunity wasted.</p> <p>I'm so reminded of George Bush. Never actually elected as US president, he in no way let this inhibit him - he grabbed power with both hands and went on as if everyone in the world agreed with him. Here's Blair teetering on the brink -and quite probably having agreed to step down - but until he actually falls over, he's going to use/abuse his position for all it's worth. But he's such a meaningless politician - whatever good is coming out of this government seems to be in spite of him, not because of him. Please, Labour party, will you now get rid of him?</p> <p>I understand the Tories have also had a conference. The nature of my job at the moment means that I'm often media-free in remote locations for a week at a time. Happily on this occasion, it coincided with the Tory conference. I thought the weekend papers might fill me in on what I'd missed but they really don't seem to have much to say about it. Michael Howard, sensing my predicament, has kindly summed up his party's manifesto in 10 words - school discipline, more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, controlled immigration. Is this really the extent of the ambition of the official opposition? That under the Tories, teachers will shout louder and nurses get better at washing their hands? It's utterly uninspiring. No wonder Blair gets away with what he does.</p>",
  "<p>Conrad Russell, the historian-turned-Liberal Democrat peer and champion of threatened individuals and minorities, died yesterday after a series of smoking-related illnesses. </p> <p>He was 67 and had been suffering from respiratory infections and emphysema. Yet he had resumed smoking, friends reported last night, suggesting that he had never recovered from the death last year of his wife, Elizabeth. </p> <p>His party leader, Charles Kennedy, led a host of tributes from political and personal colleagues for whom the tall, angular Earl Russell's combination of eccentric brilliance and integrity were irresistible attractions. </p> <p>\"He was a personal, political and intellectual rock of support for me. And his contribution to the development of liberalism in Britain should not be underestimated. He was a vigorous campaigner to the end, both in the Lords and for the Liberal Democrat party itself,\" said Mr Kennedy. </p> <p>Lady [Shirley] Williams said: \"Conrad Russell was a liberal in every fibre of his being, from his wonderful mind to his sometimes agonised body. He was a distinctive and distinguished member of the House of Lords, a man of immense learning, elegant oratory and a gentle but perspicacious wit.\" </p> <p>Lady Hollis, an ally in the Tory years, now the object of his criticisms as a Labour social security minister, spoke of his lethal combination of \"top-down sky-blue liberal principles, his belief in the rights of the individual against the state, and his demand for evidence to sustain policies. I totally respected this\". </p> <p>As the younger son of the third Earl Russell, the philosopher and political radical Bertrand Russell - who lived to be almost 100 - he had inherited the title from his half-brother (both were named Conrad in honour of the novelist) in 1987. He plunged himself into the work of the House of Lords while retaining his professorship of history at nearby King's College, London. He specialised in the 17th century. </p> <p>Colleagues last night recalled that his battles in the Lords focused on student loans and poverty, on the ineffectual nature of the Child Support Agency, and the way disentitlement to benefits, not least for asylum seekers, led to poverty. </p> <p>But he also opposed the growing use of \"skeleton bills\" which ministers could expand by regulation, and his last speech in September was related to hunting and the need for a written constitution. He was a great supporter of Stonewall, the gay lobby, but retained the friendship of peers who took the opposing view with equal vehemence. </p> <p>In 1993 he famously took up the case of Austen Donnellan, the King's student accused of date rape and almost sent down by the college, and helped him win his case. </p> <p>The bullied and lonely child of Bertrand Russell's turbulent domestic life - he did not speak to either parent for many years - he lived under the shadow that family madness was the price of genius. </p> <p>It made him determined to succeed in the marriage he contracted with Elizabeth Sanders, one of his students. He did so. </p> <p>But after her death in 2003 he struggled with his Kilburn home and to deal with practical things, not least the oxygen supply he often needed to breathe. He would ring the Lib Dems' whips office for help with it. NHS Direct would be sent to assist him. </p> <p>Though he regained enough energy to establish a fund for overseas students in his wife's name, last night some friends said he had not recovered from her death and no longer wished to. Both were heavy smokers. </p> <p>\"He lost his vitality and passion,\" said one friend.</p>",
  "<b>Terrorist groups</b> <br> The assets of the terrorist group behind the kidnap and murder of British Iraq hostage Ken Bigley have been frozen, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced. <p>Mr Brown said he had \"today instructed the Bank of England to freeze with immediate effect the assets of JTJ, the terrorist group which publicly admitted involvement in the murders of Kenneth Bigley and five other hostages and has perpetrated a range of terrorist acts across Iraq\". </p> <p>The chancellor said: \"We are working with international partners to deny JTJ access to funds across the world. We must do all in our power to ensure there is no hiding place for terrorists and no hiding place for those who finance terrorism.\" </p> <p><b>Small businesses</b><br> A boost for small businesses, offering bigger loans to fund expansion plans, was announced by Mr Brown. For firms less than three-years-old with turnovers of \u00a35.6m or less, loans under the small business guarantee scheme will increase from a maximum of \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3250,000, he said. The loans will be administered by an independent company \"at arms length from government\". </p> <p><b>Royal security</b><br> The government is giving \"anxious attention\" to the possibility of making it a criminal offence to trespass on certain Royal sites, Home Office minister Lady Scotland said amid heightened concern about security after a Fathers4Justice protester scaled Buckingham Palace last month. She said: \"There may be a strong argument for introducing a specific offence of criminal offence, just in relation to the Queen's premises and perhaps certain other security sites.\" </p> <p><b>Gambling</b><br> A controversial bill to modernise gambling laws will be introduced ahead of the Queen's speech next month, it was confirmed. Legislation to extend rights and protections for people with disabilities will also be unveiled before November 23, the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, told MPs. The move comes under measures intended to make it easier to carry legislation over from one session to the next. </p> <p><b>Westminster security</b><br> The apparent leak of a parliamentary committee's decision to shake up security at Westminster was condemned by senior Tory Sir Patrick Cormack. His comments came after an article in the Times stated that the Joint Committee on Security agreed to appoint a new head of security for the Commons and Lords, a move which would see police and MI5 take over running parliament's security. </p> <p>Mr Hain said the Commons commission would be discussing the points raised. He added: \"I take in general terms the point that you make, that we cannot operate, especially in this very sensitive area of house security, without some trust and confidence among ourselves.\" </p> <p><b>MPs' expenses</b><br> Repeated pleas for media understanding and responsibility were made ahead of next week's publication of MPs' expenses. The list will be published at 3.30pm next Thursday on the parliament website, Mr Hain announced. It will provide a breakdown of expenses claimed for staffing, additional costs allowance or London supplement and travel. </p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats, Paul Tyler cautioned: \"We hope you are not being over-optimistic in assuming that the media will not indulge in misrepresentation and misunderstanding.\" Mr Hain said he hoped journalists would act responsibly, adding: \"In all the categories of expenses that will be available for inspection by our constituents they are all to do with our work here as MPs.\" </p> <p><b>GCSE results</b><br> The GCSE results of pupils at state schools which specialise in sport are improving twice as fast as the average, schools minister Stephen Twigg said. He told MPs 48.7% achieved five or more good passes last year, up from just 41% in 1997. For the Tories, Hugh Robertson said hard-pressed teachers would need extra incentives to return to coaching school teams. </p> <p><b>EU crime cooperation</b><br> Closer cooperation with EU nations on fighting crime and managing asylum will not undermine British sovereignty, Home Office minister Caroline Flint insisted. She attacked Tory claims that the proposals would mean the UK losing control of its borders as \"myths and distortions\". </p> <p>European commission proposals to give pan-EU police force Europol investigatory powers and create a joint public prosecutor would be resisted, she pledged. </p> <p><b>Medicinal cannabis</b><br> A call by Labour's Peter Bradley for cannabis to be made available immediately as a pain-relieving medicine for multiple sclerosis sufferers was rejected by Ms Flint. She insisted it would be \"premature\" to do so when a cannabis-based treatment was still being considered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency watchdog. However she said she hoped a \"safe but speedy\" decision would be made on licensing of Sativex - testing of which has been hit by delays. </p> <p><b>Foreign Office travel costs</b><br> The cost to the taxpayer of chartering a plane for foreign secretary Jack Straw's recent trip to Sudan was \u00a3116,300, it emerged. The total cost for August's return trip via Sudan and Kenya was \u00a3168,000. Accompanying media contributed \u00a351,700 to the cost, Mr Straw told the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram. </p> <p><b>Lib Dem peers</b><br> Lord McNally was returned unopposed as the next leader of the Liberal Democrat peers, succeeding Lady Williams. Lord McNally, a former adviser to Labour prime minister James Callaghan, defected from Labour to join the breakaway SDP founded by Shirley Williams and others in 1981. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>Backbench business in the Commons includes Lords amendments to the Christmas Day (trading) bill and the report stages of the crown employment (nationality) bill and the sex discrimination (clubs and other private associations) bill.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Frogs in danger of extinction, bombers strike inside Baghdad's Green Zone, and Manchester United takeover bid falls through</p> <p><b>WORLD WANTS A KERRY VICTORY</b></p> <p>A poll of the populations of 10 countries in today's Guardian finds, by and large, that they do not like George Bush very much and would like to see him replaced as the US president by John Kerry.</p> <p>Of the 10 countries, majorities in Canada, Mexico, France, Britain, Spain, Japan, South Korea and Australia support the Democratic party challenger. The reverse is true only in Russia and Israel.</p> <p>US voters may not be as far out of step with those in many of the countries closest to America as the poll suggests. As reports of the final presidential debate in today's papers reveal, the election is on a knife-edge - Mr Kerry stands as much chance of spending the next four years in the White House as Mr Bush if the race's dynamics remain unchanged. </p> <p>\"[But] no one is underestimating the Bush campaign's capacity to change the subject - by playing up fears of another terrorist attack, say - or launching a last-minute volley of personal attacks similar to those that sank Governor Ann Richards of Texas in 1994 or Senator John McCain in the Republican primaries of 2000,\" the Independent warns.</p> <p>Still, capitals across the globe are having to take the prospect of a Kerry victory seriously. A Financial Times comment piece paints a picture of an international community in which \"diplomatic lines from Washington to national capitals from Beijing to Brussels will hum with speculation about whether we should expect a tremor or an earthquake [...] America's friends and enemies are frantically poring over every line of John Kerry's policy pronouncements\".</p> <p>The piece's author, Philip Stephens, argues there is more \"unease than certainty\" about what to expect from either Mr Bush or Mr Kerry, and the mood is no more acute than it is in Europe. The postwar alliance between Europe and the US is no longer working, he says, and it will take an effort from both sides to repair it. \"The views of Europe's leaders mirror that of their voters: they want Mr Kerry to win. But what then?\" he asks.</p> <p>Luckily, Tony Blair has an answer - sort of. The Telegraph report on his speech to the European centre-left meeting in Budapest leads on his vision of an EU-US \"common agenda\" to solve the world's problems.

  "Millions of Americans are scratching their heads over how to vote on November 2 after the last of the three televised presidential debates left George Bush and John Kerry neck and neck over jobs, education, health care and taxes, with little mention of Iraq or 9/11. But the rest of the world, according to a poll we and several other newspapers publish today, has already made up its mind, backing the Democratic challenger by a margin of two to one. <p>Any sample, of course, is just a sample, but this survey of public opinion in 10 countries does include the US's two immediate neighbours, Canada and Mexico, as well as Israel and Russia, Washington's close allies in the \"war on terror\", and Britain, still its most loyal transatlantic friend, despite widespread criticism of Tony Blair. Unfortunately, Muslim countries are absent, though their inclusion would have made even gloomier reading for the White House. A recent Pew Research Centre poll, for example, showed just 7% of Pakistanis approve of Mr Bush, while 65% have a favourable opinion of Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>These findings - likely to achieve a high degree of exposure because they are media-driven - confirm previous polls in underlining the degree of global hostility to President Bush and the Iraq war. Some 74% of Germans, according to GlobeScan, want to see Mr Kerry win the election. A June poll conducted by the German Marshall Fund found that 76% of respondents in nine European countries disapproved of Mr Bush's handling of international affairs, up significantly from a survey in 2002. It also found that 80% of Europeans polled - compared with half of Americans - said Iraq was not worth the human and financial cost. In Europe, only Poles would rather see Mr Bush back in the Oval office. Elsewhere in \"new Europe\" there is a distinctly \"old European\" wish to see the Massachusetts senator win. Further afield, Israelis are the only people to back the incumbent and to see American democracy as a model for other countries. Similarly positive views in Russia appear to reflect the hardline US view on Chechen terrorism: the survey was carried out in the aftermath of the Beslan school massacre. </p> <p>Against this bleak background, the good news is that there is a clear distinction between anti-Americanism and criticism of US policies. No less than 68% of all those polled - with the French, Mr Kerry's most fervent backers, scoring a surprising above-average 72% - have a favourable view of Americans but are implacably opposed to the US government. Opinions of the US have worsened for 57% over the past three years. </p> <p>Strikingly, though, political differences may now be casting shadows in other areas. Young Britons, avid consumers of Big Macs, Starbucks and Friends, are now hostile to American culture on a scale traditionally associated with the French. Canada, Mexico and South Korea feel even more threatened. It is common ground that Iraq and the Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib scandals have eroded the sympathy generated by the 2001 terrorist attacks. Encouragingly for whoever does win, 90% believe it is important to maintain good relations with the US. The danger is, perhaps, of expecting too much from a Kerry victory. </p> <p>Mr Bush may well wish to exploit this hostility, against a rival he has portrayed as caring too much for allies and not enough for America. Clearly, if the world had a vote, the result on November 2 would not be in doubt. The president is unlikely to be surprised that the Guardian, Asahi Shimbun, Le Monde or El Pais believe that Iraq is a \"deadly and highly questionable war\". That though, is the view of the Lone Star Iconoclast, published in his home town of Crawford, Texas. It matters a lot what others think about the US. But it is only Americans who can choose their own leader.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow our band Primal Scream, together with Spiritualized and some other special guests, are playing in London for the children of Palestine. As far as I know, it's the first time that a benefit gig has been staged on this scale in Britain for the Palestinian people.</p> <p>It is often said that the Palestinian issue is so difficult and sensitive that it's better not to get involved. But the truth is, it's not. It's easy. There is no shortage of musicians ready to show their support for the Palestinians at this time in their struggle. Ian Brown, Super Furry Animals, Mogwai, Peter Doherty, Massive Attack (3D is DJing) and many others wanted to join us, but couldn't because of other commitments.</p> <p>The truth is that most people can see what is taking place on the ground in the Middle East. And they can see who needs our support. Everyone knows who is under the boot and who's got the mouthful of broken glass. The Palestinians are a prisoner nation, refugees and exiles treated like ghosts. Now we want them to feel our solidarity.</p> <p>Of course, it's not just a question of giving them money. One reason we have got involved with the Hoping Foundation is that it supports Palestinian children in the refugee camps. Generation after generation has been there since 1948, scattered all over: Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and in occupied Palestine. From Shatila to Gaza, it is these kids I see when I think of Palestine. They have been ignored and excluded, growing up without any hope. We want to tell them we are with them, that they are not alone.</p> <p>The Hoping Foundation is the kind of organisation that asks community groups working with children to tell us what they need, rather than telling them what's good for them. It is a direct relationship and one that respects the people in the camps and their right to have their voices heard.</p> <p>When I was growing up in Scotland, my dad, a print workers' union leader, made trips to Nicaragua to support the Sandinistas. He would persuade factory owners to donate paper, and he sent school books, pens and jotters to the children. It was the obvious thing to do then, and it's the same today with Palestine. The way it looks to us, every Palestinian is a political prisoner - and every Palestinian has the right to be free.</p> <p>The band has been wanting to do this for a long time. We are all so upset and appalled with what is going on there. Of course, we're not the first musicians in this country to try to use our music to help those who need support. John Lennon used his name and money to oppose the Vietnam war and support the workers on strike. If Lennon were still on this earth, he'd be doing Palestine. In fact, he'd be rocking the Brixton Academy tomorrow night.</p> <p><strong>&amp;183;</strong>Bobby Gillespie is the lead singer with Primal Scream; the concert, Hoping for Palestine, is at the Brixton Academy tomorrow at 8pm </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hopingfoundation.org\">www.hopingfoundation.org</a></p>",
  "Earl Russell, who has died aged 67, was great-grandson of Lord John Russell, the architect of the 1832 Great Reform Bill, and son of Bertrand Russell, the philosopher and savant. It is no wonder that Conrad Russell, steeped in a sense of history, became a brilliant 17th-century historian. <p>He entered the House of Lords as the fifth Earl Russell after the death of his half-brother in 1987. He had the quirky distinction of being one of that rump of elected hereditaries who survived the cull of 1999. </p> <p>To describe Conrad as an eccentric is inadequate, though there was plenty of that about him. Those observing him speaking in the chamber from the Lords' visitors gallery might easily have been transported back to 1850: the courtesy of his manner and his honed, elegant use of English being of a piece with his hawkish, distinguished stoop. Anyone seeing him coming or going from the House in a crumpled suit carrying supermarket bags bulging with papers would have been forgiven for not recognising the same man. </p> <p>He was an opponent to beware of in debate and was ever a champion of the underdog, be he or she an asylum seeker or a widow trapped in the social security maze. He never let the House forget its great and ancient history, and could be relied upon to introduce an apt precedent - usually from the civil war era - to illuminate his argument. </p> <p>For example, already ill, he dragged himself into the House on May 4 last spring to continue the good fight against what he saw as inhumane provisions of the asylum and immigration bill. His contribution that day was studded with quotes from the MP for Knaresborough in the 17th-century Long Parliament, from Sir Thomas Wentworth (\"God deliver us from this arbitrary government\") and, to balance the verbal feast, a quote from Goldfinger rebuking James Bond. </p> <p>Conrad's lifelong concern for and empathy with young people, whether in the seminar room or on the campaign stump, could be seen as a reaction to his own bizarre and unhappy upbringing. As he warned me, \"Watch out for family issues. My own marriage was the first in the family to last \"til death us do part' since 1864.\" And it is true, his marriage with Elizabeth, one of his former pupils, was integral to the contentment he did achieve in adult life. </p> <p>As the only child of Bertrand's third marriage to Patricia Spence, having only spasmodic contact with children of his own age and a largely unhappy schooling until he went to Eton, Conrad was caught up in the malign chemistry of his parents' relationship, which ended when he was 11 in a way that traumatised him for life. Every day thereafter, he insisted, he could not get going in the mornings until he had ritually girded himself against those ghosts. </p> <p>Prior to that the three of them had lived in the US for much of the second world war, in relatively straitened and isolated circumstances. In fact he got on well with his overpowering father who, at least to him, was not self-centred, yet not one to whom a son could go for practical advice. Conrad loved recalling Bertrand's summoning \"a footman\" from his sick bed, an age after that reality. </p> <p>At Eton, under Robert Birley, he felt quickly at home, an oddball among oddballs. A real high point of his life was becoming \"keeper of the wall\", which made him captain of games and one to whom, therefore, the real sporting toffs had to defer. He also contracted there his love of cricket which, with swimming, is described as his recreation in Who's Who. </p> <p>It was at Merton College Oxford, from which he graduated in 1958, that he really came into his own, socially as well as intellectually, stimulated by three exceptional men, Ralph Davis, Roger Highfield and John Roberts. By then he was a compulsive conversationalist and controversialist and took to the Union. Ideas, openly and generously debated, were his staple ever after, though small talk never a forte. One of his contemporaries remembers scrumming with him in the second row of Merton's second XV and being rebuked by the front row for talking too much, and of Conrad pacing his room into the small hours redelivering by rote great speeches of Sir Edward Cooke, John Pym and other of his political heroes. </p> <p>All this was a blessed relief from the years trapped between warring parents, and it was out of the misery of that time that he twice attempted suicide. Only at Oxford did he realise that people liked him which, he recollected, \"was quite a shock\". </p> <p>The 1970s and 1980s were dominated by his academic advancement and authorship of a series of esteemed books, mostly about Stuart England. Always suspicious of the doctrinaire and the \"grand sweep\" which rode over unaccommodating and often conflicting reality, Conrad retained a dogged regard for original sources, and a mind ever open to the facts. Of all his works he will probably be most remembered for The Fall Of British Monarchies 1637-1642 (1991) which, some think, permanently shifted the interpretation of that period. </p> <p>He was a committed, conscientious and inspiring teacher. From 1960 to 1974 he was a lecturer in history at London University's Bedford College, and a reader until 1979 when he became professor of history at Yale University where he was remembered inter alia for his \"English-exoticness\". From 1984 he was Astor professor of British history at University College London , and from 1990 to 2002, professor of British history at King's College London. En route he was Sir Henry Savile research professor at his own college in Oxford, delivered the Ford lectures at Oxford (1987-88), and wrote and lectured voluminously. </p> <p>The academic event which most gratified him was the publication in 2002 of a set of essays, Politics, Religion And Popularity, to celebrate his contribution to history. Besides being edited by professors from the universities of California and Princeton and by Dr Richard Cust from Birmingham University, the 12 other contributors reflect the academic cream of his period. The preface refers to his \"intellectual presence and his stature as a scholar\" and his enhancing approach to students and collaborators. </p> <p>In politics Conrad was, as Shirley Williams puts it, \"a liberal in every fibre of his being\". Although his affiliations veered between Liberal and Labour more than once, and although his only parliamentary contest was in 1966 for Labour, he finally returned to the party of his forefathers in 1974, and had been an unflagging activist for it ever since. </p> <p>It was typical of Conrad that last year, health already impaired, he threw himself into the by-election to elect the young Sarah Teather as member of parliament for Brent East. It is no less typical that he was as happy stuffing envelopes as drafting press releases. </p> <p>Conrad spawned affectionate anecdotes wherever he went, whether retailed by history students, aspiring politicos or, indeed, his peers. His integrity, humanity, acuity and shy warmth will dog his memory. </p> <p><b>Michael White</b> writes: When Conrad Russell turned up in the then-Liberal whips office after succeeding his halfbrother to the Russell earldom in 1987 the party could scarcely believe its luck. Political friends and opponents knew that this revisionist historian of the English civil war had also written books on liberalism and worked from a mixture of first principles and evidence-based analysis. But he was also a Russell, heir to more than 300 years at the centre of English political life.</p> <p>Mark Bonham-Carter, another Liberal dynast in the Lords, used to say that \"listening to Conrad you could be listening to Lord John Russell. You felt the Russells must always have sounded like that.\" </p> <p>Despite his brilliance and his passion for social policy, laced with insights into Elizabethan poor law, he was also guilty of clever peoples' severe lapses of judgment. As such, he backed the then-Taunton MP, Jackie Ballard's bid for the Liberal Democrat leadership in 1999 after Paddy Ashdown stepped down and Charles Kennedy was all but certain to win. </p> <p>An improbable spin doctor, Russell once drew for me a diagram showing how Ms Ballard would win on the seventh round. She didn't. </p> <p>Russell had a loud, infectious laugh, and some endearingly impractical habits which made women motherly, though they knew he was devoted to his late wife. </p> <p>He married Elizabeth Sanders in 1962, and she died in 2003. He leaves two sons, Nicholas (Viscount Amberley) and John. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell (Fifth Earl Russell), historian and politician, born April 15 1937; died October 14 2004</p>",
  "Two years ago, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child called for the creation of independent institutions across the UK to monitor, promote and protect children's human rights. In a green paper, Every Child Matters, the government duly promised England's 11 million children a champion independent of government. (Children in other countries of the UK already had, or were soon to have, children's commissioners.) Children's rights campaigners were delighted. <p>But the cheers died down with the publication of the children bill in March this year. Children in England looked set to get the weakest commissioner in Europe, with no independent powers and an incredibly weak function, ie promoting awareness of children's views and interests. As the bill passed through the Lords, the commissioner's powers were improved considerably. But that is not the end of the story. </p> <p>This week the children bill began its detailed scrutiny in the Commons, and the government has reversed many of the positive changes. On Tuesday, the country's first ever children's minister, Margaret Hodge, managed to get five references to children's rights removed from the bill. </p> <p>Hodge says she doesn't want a children's commissioner who will police individual rights. But nobody is asking for that. The role of a commissioner is to expose shortcomings in the treatment of children when they occur, and to seek to protect their human rights. And there is much protecting to be done. </p> <p>Take juvenile justice. The Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2002 noted the UK's extremely low age of criminal responsibility and urged the government to increase it \"considerably\". The law allows children from the age of 10 to be tried in adult courts and to be imprisoned. Before Robert Thompson and Jon Venables could appear in court in 1993, a carpenter had to build a block on the witness stand so the two boys could see the courtroom. </p> <p>The European court of human rights in Strasbourg recently heard a case of an English 11-year-old tried in an adult crown court. A consultant clinical psychologist had advised the judge that the boy had a developmental age of between six and eight. Yet the judge continued with the proceedings, and an application to the court of appeal failed. The Strasbourg court ruled that his right to a fair trial had been breached. </p> <p> Two children have died in custody this year. Gareth Myatt, 15, died while being restrained in Hassockfield secure training centre, one of four privately run child prisons. When in opposition, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Blunkett voted against them. They preferred local authority secure children's homes, staffed by social workers. The other child was 14-year-old Adam Rickwood, the youngest person ever to die in custody. This takes the number of child deaths in custody since 1990 to 27. </p> <p>During the past year, 3,337 children assessed as too vulnerable for prison were, nevertheless, sent to young offender institutions. The Youth Justice Board aims to reduce the number of children in custody by 10% over the next three years. The international human rights standard is that children should only be imprisoned as a last resort, and for the shortest period possible. </p> <p>In this country, children can be locked up even if they have committed no crime. In June, 60 asylum-seeking children were held in immigration removal or \"reception\" centres. The government had an opportunity to end detention this year, as another asylum bill passed through parliament. But there was no softening of policy. Instead, a new offence has been introduced of entering the country without documents, carrying the same two-year prison sentence for children and adults. </p> <p>Then there is smacking. The government is allowing a free vote on fox hunting, but still refuses to allow its MPs to exercise their conscience on whether babies and children should have the same legal protection from being hit as adults. The first act of parliament protecting children from cruelty came 60 years after similar protective legislation for animals. So no change there. </p> <p>The convention on the rights of the child has the status of international law. But children cannot seek justice through the courts when their convention rights are breached. Apart from a trip to Geneva once every five years to account for its action on children's rights, a government can, if it chooses, ignore the rights of children. Which is why it is so important that children get a champion who has the political clout and independence to encourage, cajole and shame ministers into fulfilling their human rights obligations. Castrating the children's commissioner before he or she has even started is the ultimate snub. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Carolyne Willow is national coordinator of the Children's Rights Alliance for England </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:cwillow@crae.org.uk\">cwillow@crae.org.uk</a></p>",
  "There's a sense of resignation on the old-town side of Stevenage, Hertfordshire. <p>Development, locals know, is inevitable, but that does not mean they court it. </p> <p>With news revealed in the Guardian yesterday that 500,000 new homes would be built in the east of England as part of John Prescott's new housing development plans, local fears grew about the effects on local wildlife and the water system. </p> <p>But more than anything, it was knowing the green belt would be heavily impinged upon, and in some places disappear altogether, that caused concern. </p> <p>Villages throughout Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire were coming to terms with news which for years they have suspected was not far away. They worry that the village appeal created by Tudor houses, sloping cemeteries and historic churches will be swamped by overdevelopment. </p> <p>According to documents obtained by the Guardian, in Stevenage alone there will be an estimated 6,400 houses built in the next 21 years. JP Cleverly, who lives on the outskirts of Stevenage, near Hitchin, says his area is one on which he knows the development will have an impact. </p> <p>\"It's all just going to be swallowed up, isn't it?\" he says, referring to the green belt. </p> <p>\"I just think about the fields where I live and I think where are the bloody rivers going to run? And the wildlife, what is going to happen there? </p> <p>\"The wildlife is part of our country and if you do away with that out here you have nothing left. It's all about people just making money, that's all it is.\" </p> <p>Douglas Moulding said that over the last two years the threat of redevelopment had been imminent, and something locals had fought against initially but had gradually learned to accept. \"It's just terrible, and over the past two years we have seen it come closer and closer,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I really don't know how the green belt area of the town is going to cope with this news. I think there's a lot more brown sites which they could have used and I'm really sorry that the green belt is going to suffer because of this.\" </p> <p>While many locals acknowledged that the effect on the local economy of the development would be good for the future of their children, and possibly lead to improved hospitals and schools, there was still overwhelming resistance, which mostly stemmed from concerns about the environment. </p> <p>Roger Millard has lived in Stevenage since 1958. Much of his family lives there and he has worked in the town for most of his life. </p> <p>He is concerned that the local infrastructure will not be able to cope with the development onslaught. </p> <p>\"The bypass here can't cope with traffic at the moment, and that will obviously get worse and worse as more people arrive,\" he said. </p> <p>\"In a way it is inevitable there would be development on the scale which is proposed, but if there was less immigration, and less broken families, maybe we wouldn't need as many new homes.\" </p> <p>Mr Millard, 68, said he hoped it would bring new business into the town, but transport would need to be improved. \"The trains are already at bursting point back into the city,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But it is a difficult situation, people saying they don't want redevelopment, because if there wasn't redevelopment in the first place then I wouldn't have my home here. </p> <p>\"So in a way it is a bit naughty of us who have homes here to say we don't want others coming in. It's hypocritical then, isn't it?\" </p> <p>In Broxbourne, another area flagged for extensive redevelopment, the high street is already filled with traffic and residents are concerned about how they will cope under the strain of a reported 5,100 additional homes being built between 2001 and 2021. </p> <p>A local estate agent, John Moore, realises his business will benefit but, as a passionate local, he can also see how development is ruining the town. </p> <p>\"It's very difficult to say as a local estate agent, as redevelopment is good for business,\" he said. \"But I have lived here for the best part of 30 years and we are suffering.\" </p> <p>The population of 9,000 already had problems getting around on the roads, he said, and important parts of the community, such as a local school, were being lost to redevelopment. </p> <p>\"Broxbourne is a very small place and I don't believe we have the capacity for another 5,000 homes. Broxbourne is under threat, and I do feel threatened by it. </p> <p>\"We will just become part of the north London overspill.\" </p>",
  "He may have two legs rather than four, no bushy tail and prefer his chicken cooked, but no one in Britain has a better idea of what it is like to be a fox than Alun Michael. The rural affairs minister, who has shepherded the anti-hunting legislation through the Commons, has become the quarry of the angriest of foxhunters. <p>He has had to cancel meetings, change his social engagements and watch over his shoulder after one of the most vitriolic campaigns against a minister since the person in charge of ending free school milk became Thatcher - milk snatcher. Mr Michael is even featured on one pro-hunting website as Hitler. </p> <p>It may be raining heavily, but about 200 hunt supporters have turned out to picket a conference Mr Michael is attending in Maidstone in Kent. The sight of his car is greeted with the sound of hunting horns. There is a large police presence but the protest, this time, is mild and four pro-hunters are allowed into the hotel where Mr Michael is to address the conference of Ruralnet, a countryside regeneration charity. </p> <p>Sue Palmer, a farmer's wife covered with pro-hunting badges, tells him \"the fox will be wiped out if you ban hunting, it will be far crueller\". She says her farm relies on the hunt to control foxes and if the ban goes ahead, they will have to shoot the hounds, \"and we'll do it publicly\". </p> <p>Kerry, whose husband works for the local hunt and has a tied cottage, asks: \"How would your wife feel if she was about to be made homeless?\" She says her husband will be out of work at 50. Mr Michael responds that he has had, in the past, to talk to steel workers in his Cardiff constituency who have also been forced to retrain late in life. </p> <p>There is some cut-and-thrust between the two sides with Mrs Palmer saying it is a town versus country issue. The hunters leave saying \"you're not going to see us go away\". </p> <p><b>Warning</b><br> </p> <p>The first indication Mr Michael was going to be the pro-hunting lobby's main target came with the launch of the right to roam in mid-September. He was due to attend a celebratory rally in the Peak District but pulled out once it became clear there would be a demonstration against him. He said police had warned him there might be violence. The Countryside Alliance said he exaggerated the advice and quoted the local police as saying there had been no mention of violence, merely of protest. He disputes that. </p> <p>\"The police advice was very clear that my presence was going to lead to thousands of protesters turning up which would have hijacked and distorted the whole event and the police would have been hard put to guarantee the safety of the public,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Given that we had invited walkers, families, disabled youngsters to promote the inclusive nature of access it would have been to undo several years of very hard work and distort an event which was meant to celebrate nearly 100 years of campaigning. By absenting myself from that, I enabled the story to be the opening of the right to roam. There are difficulties to taking that decision because you get the distortion of 'oh, you are afraid to come' or you are somehow not welcome in the countryside, which is another of their pieces of sloganising.\" </p> <p>Later in September he cancelled plans to take part in the launch of a trust fund to promote Dorset's Jurassic coast, which included sailing around the coast, once it became clear that hunters would be present in large numbers. \"I thought it important to be there but not as important for me to enjoy a voyage along the coast in the Waverley, the paddle steamer which was intended to be the high point of the day,\" he says. </p> <p>\"The police were seriously concerned about policing an event on the seaside and on a vessel. The Countryside Alliance says in a cloyingly patronising way that 'it's a pity the minister for rural affairs isn't welcome in the countryside'. Well, I'm sorry, I found myself most welcome in the countryside. It is the minority of people who hunt who don't welcome me.\" </p> <p>Then, in Exeter, for the meeting of the National Parks Association, the hunters tracked Mr Michael down to a hotel and pelted him with eggs and paint as he left, holding up signs saying Judas. </p> <p>\"When you look at the faces and expressions of hatred on the people and listen to the expletives people are shouting, you have to be worried about what that mentality can lead to,\" he says. \"Those are people who have an absolute judgment about me and anyone who votes against hunting yet they've never met me, never had a dialogue.\" </p> <p>Mr Michael, a former journalist with the South Wales Echo and a youth worker in Cardiff's docklands, became an MP in 1987 but has never been a confrontational politician. From his days as a shadow home office minister through his time at the Wales Office, he has adopted a low-key approach to political life which makes his predicament more remarkable. </p> <p>Is he surprised at the level of vitriol? \"Deeply disappointed because I put an enormous amount of effort in trying to get people to listen to each other ... Some of the people who take their children along to these events don't understand the particularly awful example they are setting. There is such a focused belief that they are right ... that I believe they find it almost impossible to look outside their own mindset,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I have to say it's been equally difficult to persuade people who oppose hunting that a little room needs to be given to hunting people to accept change. We are starting to see seriously intimidating protests, an attempt to bully. I've even heard people say this is what we fought the second world war for. Well, actually it was rather more to defend a parliamentary democracy in which individual MPs ... cast their votes in the way which they think is right. </p> <p>\"There's no sort of attempt at persuasion or argument. It seems basically to be threats and intimidation or almost a feeling that spoiling our lives is reasonable retribution for the legislation which anyway is in the hands of parliament. The abuse convinces me that this issue has to be resolved.\" </p> <p>What effect has it had on his family? \"They're not happy with it, they're clearly upset by it, but they're very supportive,\" he says. </p> <p>He says Peter Hain, as leader of the House of Commons, and Lord Whitty, who handles the legislation in the Lords, had been subject to personal protests. </p> <p>He believes the row will blow over. \"Presumably the same decisions were taken at the time to ban bear baiting or cock fighting or dog fighting but I think, in retrospect, few people would seek to justify any of those activities.\" </p> <p>Does he sympathise with the view expressed in the Observer that foxhunting is a side issue, that far greater cruelty to animals is inflicted by factory farming? \"It's a different issue,\" he says. Foxhunting has become such a big battle it has to be settled. It is a choice by individual MPs, not something imposed by the government. </p> <p>He says that after long negotiations with the Countryside Alliance there had been a falling out, not least because of the tone taken by the alliance's website - which they justified by saying they feared that if they were too restrained the more belligerent groups would take over. </p> <p><b>Extreme</b><br> </p> <p>\"The language of the most moderate seems to be dictated by an attempt to appease the most extreme,\" he says. </p> <p>John Jackson, the alliance's chairman, has told Mr Michael that protests against him were \"entirely of your own creation. I have lost count of the times I have told you that, if you did not keep your promise to address the question of hunting on principle and evidence, the country would erupt in fury.\" </p> <p>Mr Jackson went on to say that Mr Michael's remarks about the legislation had been \"tyrannical and cruel\". Mr Michael says his postbag splits down the middle with 7,500 to 8,000 letters saying \"ban everything\" and the same number saying \"leave everything alone\". </p> <p>Will this be Tony Blair's poll tax? \"That's a very unfair comparison,\" he says. </p> <p>He says many people in the countryside oppose hunting but are reluctant to say so. \"There is a much quieter but significant number of country people, including farmers, who will be delighted to see an end to hunting, but because that view is not voiced very strongly in the circles that hunting people frequent - perhaps quite wisely on the part of those who hold those opinions - they are reinforced in the view that such opinions don't exist. So they have this mythology that somehow they speak for the countryside. </p> <p>\"I've frequently had people in the margins of meetings in the last couple years coming up to me and saying 'I'm a farmer, I think what you're doing is absolutely right. These [fox-hunters] are very single-minded people and I would not particularly say this in public, but they do damage to my land they don't really do anything to control the vermin, they're a very narrow and selfish group of people.' And I've certainly had messages from a lot of people concerned about the countryside thanking me.\" </p> <p><b>Election</b><br> </p> <p>The tempo of the campaign against him seems unlikely to slacken in the run-up to the general election, although the issue may be less important to the electorate than the pro-hunt lobby suggest. </p> <p>On October 4, the Daily Telegraph reported the results of a poll in which they asked people what would make them vote Conservative. A promise to continue to allow foxhunting came 13th on the list, below reducing the number of speed cameras and a promise to build more prisons. Only 6% said a reintroduction of hunting would make them more likely to vote Tory, compared with 49% who would be motivated by a clampdown on immigration. </p> <p>Another target of the campaign is Sir Gerald Kaufman, who wrote in this newspaper about his experience at the Labour party conference in Brighton where he said he had been attacked by people calling him a \"Jewish bigot\", including some who broke open his briefcase, tore his conference pass off him and jostled him until he was rescued by police. He described them as \"racist, larcenous scum\". </p> <p>The alliance's response, in the form of a letter from the chief executive, Simon Hart, was that Sir Gerald had brought the trouble on himself and had deliberately provoked the response. </p> <p>\"The Alliance,\" wrote Mr Hart, \"is determined that our protests will remain lawful and peaceful but, however much I would regret it, I cannot guarantee that angry people will not react to the sort of provocation Sir Gerald put them under.\" </p> <p>The alliance has condemned specific protests, such as breaking in to the House of Commons and the dumping of animal carcasses in Brighton during the Labour conference, but has promised the cam-paign will continue at full tilt. </p> <p>Mr Michael is learning, like the fox, that the best bet is to listen for the sound of the hunting horn, keep ahead of the pack and, when necessary, go to ground. Among the hobbies he lists in Who's Who is long-distance running. </p>",
  "<p>After a decent interval post-9/11, Roland Emmerich returns to his main job as the modern equivalent of disaster king Irwin \"The Swarm\" Allen with a few extra noughts on the end of the budget.
