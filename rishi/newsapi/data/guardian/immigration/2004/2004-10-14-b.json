  "The name Bush is well known in Mexico: the 41st and 43rd American presidents have their homes in Texas, a bordering state the Mexicans lost during the Mexican-American war in the 19th century. <p>In the early 90s, George Bush Sr signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which brought Mexico into the pre-existing Canadian-American trade partnership. </p> <p>His son was the favourite candidate of most Mexicans in 2000, and Mexico was the first foreign country George Bush visited as president - breaking a tradition of going to Canada first. </p> <p>However, things have changed quite a lot for Bush: Senator John Kerry, a political figure previously unknown to most Mexicans, has rallied majority support south of the border in his quest for the presidency. </p> <p>Kerry may have failed to captivate most Mexicans, but he has certainly benefited from a general rejection of the president. That famous motto from the 1992 US election - \"It's the economy, stupid\" - seems to have found new form in Mexico: \"It's Bush, stupid!\"</p> <p>In a national poll of Mexican adults conducted by the newspaper Reforma in collaboration with 10 major papers around the world, 55% of respondents said they would prefer John Kerry to win the presidential election on November 2, while 20% backed Bush. </p> <p>Some 33% of Mexicans polled said they knew nothing about John Kerry - substantially more than the 6% who said the same about George Bush. </p> <p>Why have they turned their backs on Bush? It is not the bilateral relationship per se: about 60% of Mexicans polled considered current relations with the US to be good or very good; it is how Mexicans view the war against terrorism in general and the pre-emptive war in Iraq in particular. </p> <p>According to the poll, 83% think invading Iraq was wrong. The poll was conducted before the first presidential debate, but Kerry's depiction of the war as a \"colossal error\" may have found an echo in Mexican public opinion. Six out of 10 respondents said the war in Iraq had contributed nothing in the fight against terrorism. </p> <p>These perceptions have hit Bush's ratings. A majority of Mexicans - 56%, to be specific - said their opinion of the president had deteriorated over the last two or three years. Only 23% said they had a favourable opinion of him. By contrast, 51% expressed a favourable opinion about Americans in general. </p> <p>Some 92% percent think it is very important that Mexico maintains good relations with its northern neighbour. This opinion is based not only on the rules of diplomacy but also on everyday life: more than 1 million families get much of their income from their relatives living in the US.</p> <p>Mexicans seem very aware of American life and society. Most are exposed to Hollywood, American television and American music; a lesser but substantial proportion read American newspapers and magazines. </p> <p>Six out of 10 say they are informed very well, or somewhat, about the US. More than 40% have actually been to the US for work, vacations, family visits, study or other reasons. </p> <p>With all this, very few view a Bush re-election with optimism: just 15% think a Republican victory would improve the international state of affairs.</p> <p>After all, two-thirds consider that the US has substantial influence in the world and most Mexicans think it will remain the world's largest economic power for the foreseeable future.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alejandro Moreno writes for Refoma</p>",
  "Even now, the White House - or at least one room, the Lincoln bedroom - is being redecorated for President Bush's second term. The famous long bed will remain; so will the original Emancipation Proclamation in its glass case. But, dominating the room, above the bed, will be placed a large carved crown from which will flow, ceiling to floor, royal purple satin drapes. The crown has been sent to be gilded with gold in anticipation of Bush's triumphant return from his campaign. <p>Bush began the TV debates with John Kerry ahead in the polls. After grimacing his way through the first debate, he corrected himself by maintaining strict control of facial muscles in his second. Then after he channelled his boiling emotions into hot-headed belligerence, he recast himself for the third debate with fixed grins however grim the subject. It was his best performance, and the best he could do ... and not good enough. </p> <p>The final debate focused on Bush's weak point, the home front, where he lagged on every issue. On the debate's eve, polls revealed that the voters want a change in direction, a new president, but remained tentative about Kerry. On that soft ice, despite the dead heat, the incumbent could prevail by asserting his mastery. </p> <p>Bush's story is only of the \"war president\". As he tells it, September 11 leads him in a straight line to invade Iraq, and \"freedom is on the march\". True or not, it is a simple story that many can follow. But his narrative of the \"homeland president\" is a melange of avoidances and denials. Chronology is crucified, cause and effect stood on their heads. Under his aegis, nearly one million jobs have been lost, the worst record since the Great Depression; he has squandered the largest surplus and created the largest deficit; more than 4.5 million have lost their health insurance and more than 45 million are uncovered; and so it goes on. </p> <p>But in Bush's telling, for example, his regressive tax, source of much of the deficit, passed before September 11, was enacted afterward. He mentioned as little as possible his Medicare prescription drug bill, despised by most of the elderly, who will pay more - a bill approved only because the Medicare actuary was threatened with dismissal should he tell Congress the true cost. (The twisting of information and intimidation on the Medicare bill are similar to the distortions and coercion in the rush to the Iraq war.) </p> <p>Bush attempted to change the subject to his fictional version of his education bill, \"Leave No Child Behind\", evidence of \"compassionate conservatism\". Asked by the moderator whether he favoured an increase in the minimum wage, he hailed his achievement on education, but never responded to Kerry's factual addition that Bush had failed to secure the $28bn needed to implement the measure. Nor did Bush acknowledge that many states have filed suits in federal courts against \"Leave No Child Behind\" due to the absence of funding, or that the original sponsor of the bill was Senator Edward Kennedy. Instead, he used Kennedy as a straw man. \"There's a mainstream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank,\" the president charged. \"As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.\" </p> <p>Kerry's performance, consistent with previous ones, disclosed his knowledge of policy and toughness - and refuted the negative image projected by the Bush campaign of him as flip-flopper. He too raised the icon of Kennedy - this time John F Kennedy - to establish his credentials on Bush's supposed high ground, the cardinal virtues of faith. </p> <p>After Bush skirted the question of whether he would appoint supreme court justices who would uphold Roe v Wade, the decision legalising abortion, Kerry defended women's right to choose as a \"constitutional right\", defended gay rights, and passionately defended the minimum wage. And then he said: \"I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Throughout my life this has made a difference to me. And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, 'I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic.' My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, 'What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead.'\" </p> <p>Haunted by his father's defeat, Bush's presidency has been a case study in reaction formation. He marched to Baghdad, ensured he had no enemy to his right, and cut taxes regardless of the deficit. In the last debate, he sputtered about \"a liberal senator from Massachusetts\", repeating attack lines from his father's old campaign and coming full circle in pursuit of the gilded crown. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "Canada's hockey arenas have never had a reputation as forums of political unrest. So when Montreal fans began systematically booing the US national anthem last year before the teams took to the ice, there was clearly more to it than just a few troublemakers voicing their discontent. <p>Our feelings towards the US, and not just towards the powers that be in Washington, had officially changed. The general hostility towards the Bush administration's warrior politics had taken on a downright anti-American look.</p> <p>Admittedly, this was Quebec, a rebel, nationalist, francophone province. Commentators expressed a feeling of shame at this politicisation of a purely athletic contest. Nothing of the like had ever happened in Toronto or Vancouver.</p> <p>But the poll we are publishing today tells us that throughout Canada, our opinion of the US and its president is sinking. This is especially true in Quebec, where 76% of respondents said their opinion of the US had worsened over the past two or three years, but even in Canada 64% said the same.</p> <p>This does not mean quite the same thing here as it would in Madrid or Berlin. At first sight, indeed, no country is as American as Canada except - possibly - for the United States.</p> <p>We drive the same cars, live in the same homes, wear the same clothes, see the same movies, commute from the same suburbs, shop at the same Wal-Marts and, if we are Anglo-Canadians, watch the same television and read the same magazines. We felt close to the trauma on September 11 2001. New York is just next door. Thousands of Canadians know people who died that day.</p> <p>Everything would seem to contrive to bring the two countries together, including our common border, the longest in the world: 90% of Canada's population lives within a three-hour drive of our neighbour to the south. Both countries are each other's main economic partner.</p> <p>Yet history has made us profoundly different from one another: one out of four Canadians, and four out of five Quebecers, are francophone; and the Queen of England is still our head of state.</p> <p>Our socio-political culture, too, sets us apart. It is most unlikely that any Canadian prime minister in the last 35 years would ever have been elected in the United States - except possibly in Vermont or Minnesota, two Northern States that have, over the years, produced such un-American things as maple syrup and hockey players.</p> <p>Jean Chr\u00e9tien, who was prime minister from 1993 to 2003, was in favour of gay marriage, opposed to the death penalty, a staunch defender of a universal free healthcare system entirely controlled by the state, and a proponent of rigorous weapon control - basically, far too leftwing to ever make it as a US Democrat.</p> <p>So it comes as no surprise that many more Canadians have a favourable opinion of John Kerry (55%) than of George Bush (29%) - even more so in unionised, social democratic Quebec, where 71% favour Kerry while only 11% favour Bush.</p> <p>Much more significant is the fact that the US reputation as a prime example of democracy has weakened considerably: 59% of Quebecers no longer view the US as a model, and 36% of respondents in the rest of Canada agree with them. More than two-thirds (70%) of those questioned in Quebec believe that the US does not contribute to world peace, as do 47% of Canadians in general. The vast majority of Canadians (85%) also think that the USA exerts too much influence in international affairs.</p> <p>That much said, despite occasional spurts of vaguely anti-American nationalism, Canadians are well aware of what they owe to their southern neighbours: their prosperity and the defence of their continent. All Canadians consider it important or very important to maintain good relations with the US: 89% of Quebecers believe so, as do 95% of respondents in Canada as a whole.</p> <p>It wasn't an easy matter for Canada to oppose the war in Iraq, and it may well prove very difficult to oppose the latest anti-missile shield project. In a country whose army relies on second-hand submarines that catch fire at sea and on helicopters with a history of killing those soldiers who still dare to fly in them, we aren't in much of a position to throw our weight around on the military scene.</p> <p>Canadians like to think of themselves as a fiercely independent people. They reserve their right to boo if they so please - and to be Americans in their own way, if and when it suits or pleases them.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Yves Boisvert is a columnist with La Presse in Montr\u00e9al</p>",
  "Over the past three years, to judge by these polls, the Bush administration has squandered a huge wealth of global goodwill towards America - a moral, political and social asset as necessary to managing the world as money or military power. <p>Rarely has an administration been as isolated as this one is after the situation it has created in Iraq. </p> <p>In the end, however, whether it is Bush or Kerry who wins, the US will need some international help if it is to escape the quicksand it has fallen into through recklessnes, ideology and incompetence.</p> <p>That wealth of sympathy was never so great as in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Yet three years later, mostly because of the war against Iraq, the perception of the US and of its administration among citizens in the countries included in the poll, from Japan to Mexico, lies at almost dangerous levels - at least, it does in Spain. </p> <p>Even during the long Vietnam war, successive administrations were able to leave \"their\" war out of transatlantic relationships. Iraq, however, is a different case, because of its importance from regional and strategic points of view, because of all the deception, because of the emergence of a global public opinion, and because the invasion is seen as useless in the war against terrorism. </p> <p>Generally speaking, the polls show the same pattern in almost every country: rejection of the Iraq invasion, contempt for the Bush administration and lukewarm support for Kerry, but no clear sentiment of anti-Americanism, no rejection of the Americans or of their society. Such is the case in Spain, where there has traditionally been anti-American sentiment on the extreme right and the extreme left, but not in the centre. </p> <p>This lack of anti-Americanism is evidence of a mature society. Along with Mexico's, Spain's rejection of the war was the most emphatic - the strongest in Europe, including Britain, where opposition to the invasion and to Bush is as big as in other countries. Yet only 32.5% of Spaniards claim to have a poor opinion of the Americans, while 47.3% think favourably of them. </p> <p>The divide between the Spanish left and right in this respect is obvious, but even Popular party voters largely reject the war and the Bush administration, while expressing some scepticism about Kerry. These views are widespread in the society as a whole and in other countries, though the Democratic candidate is way ahead in the preferences.</p> <p>The big exception is Israel, which clearly supports both this war and Bush and wants the US to keep playing the role of world leader. This gulf between the Israeli and European points of view is one of the things widening the transatlantic breach. </p> <p>To a lesser degree, Russia shares Israel's more lenient attitude towards Bush. The Russians are, perhaps because of their past and their dreams of being a great power, among those who most favour the US being the world's policeman, whereas Europe sees the hyperpower as wielding too much influence.</p> <p>Many links have been broken in the last three years. However, these polls show that whether the winner is Bush or Kerry, the possibility remains - perhaps even with a mandate - of rearranging positions in a way that people would understand, as long as those positions were reasonable. </p> <p>In every country, the generally favourable opinion of \"the Americans\" should mean that after November 2 it will not be too difficult to achieve a victory for who regard a good relationship with the US as very important - provided Washington also takes a step.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andr\u00e9s Ortega writes for El Pa\u00eds</p>",

  "<p>Oil prices fell back sharply yesterday from the record highs seen on Tuesday on a bout of profit-taking from big investment houses. </p> <p>US light crude futures were down 51 cents a barrel on the day to $52 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than $2 below the $54.45 record set on Tuesday. London Brent closed was down $1.10 at $48.85. Earlier this week it had been above $50. </p> <p>Dealers said the market had turned bearish after prices failed to break the $55 level and people started to focus on the fact that the 75% rise in oil prices so far this year could lead to demand drying up. </p> <p>The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday that world oil demand growth would be considerably slower in 2005 than this year's fastest rate for a quarter of a century, and that China was trying to reduce its consumption of oil. </p> <p>Oil prices were also said to be under pressure because of heavy selling on other commodities markets, hit by fears of a slowdown in demand from China's fast-growing industrial sector. </p> <p>The fall in prices could prove temporary, because Gulf of Mexico production is still disrupted in the wake of Hurricane Ivan. </p> <p>A strike by oil workers in Nigeria, although having had little impact on the country's exports so far, could yet become more severe and hamper supplies. </p> <p>\"The prospect of increased consumer demand towards the year-end as the northern hemisphere winter closes in is another point of concern that is likely to keep the market sensitised ... until significant new capacity comes on stream,\" said Catherine Hunter, analyst at World Markets Research Centre.</p>",
  "<p>The US has Houston as its oil capital and the UK has Aberdeen. Wherever you go in the town, there are signs of the oil industry that has driven the economy of this town for over 30 years. Trucks drive through the city centre transporting lengths of chain as a thick as a child's arm and piles of steel hawsers: both used in the heavy industrial business of extracting oil from below the seabed. </p> <p>Although the Texans are proud of displaying their wealth with shiny skyscrapers and swaths of swanky suburbs, signs of prosperity are harder to find in Aberdeen. The streets are lined with branches of the Co-op rather than designer names. It may be the fact that Britain's oil reserves are in decline that has resulted in Aberdeen's parsimony. But those involved in the region's oil industry are resolutely upbeat. </p> <p>About 30bn barrels of oil have been pumped from Britain's oil reserves, says Mike Tholen of the UK Offshore Operators' Association. But there remains a further 30bn - so only 50% of the reserves have been exploited. </p> <p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but it is the maturing of the oilfields that is driving the growth of Aberdeen. While the oil majors are not always interested in squeezing the last drop of oil from their fields, there are many smaller operators that specialise in extracting oil from mature fields. </p> <p>\"There are many more players on the market today than there were ten years ago,\" said Jim Atack, managing director of Petrofac - an oil service company. The new players are either US companies who are transferring their expertise of managing mature fields in the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea or British independent companies . </p> <p>The development of service companies like Petrofac has made it possible for the smaller operators to develop the mature oilfields - known as brownfields, said Mr Atack. \"The smaller operators do not have the necessary manpower to develop the sites alone which is where we service contractors come in.\" </p> <p>Pumping oil is not as easy as simply sinking a well. Crude oil is usually found in a large flat layer of porous rock. Although it is easy to remove the oil around the drill site, extracting more oil from the remainder of the reserve can be tricky. </p> <p>To overcome this problem, oil companies will use other technological tricks, such as horizontal drilling and injecting water or gas to drive more oil out of the rocks. But these techniques are costly. </p> <p>Alex Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen, thinks conventional wisdom on the future of the North Sea is too gloomy. \"Current forecasts underestimate future possible production.\" </p> <p>The main difference between Professor Kemp's estimate and others, is the amount of incremental oil that could be produced - in other words the exploitation of the brownfield sites. </p> <p>With the price of oil having rocketed by 73% since the beginning of this year to over $50 a barrel, this could be seen as a significant incentive for extracting the black stuff. \"Oil companies are used to the price being highly volatile so are very cautious about what price they use to decide where to invest,\" said Mr Atack. </p> <p>The oil community is thought to be using a price of only $20-$25 a barrel to assess where to allocate capital in developing new wells. \"There is a feeling that the supply and demand curve has changed forever and higher oil prices are here to stay,\" said Mr Atack. </p> <p>Higher prices will certainly encourage further development of brownfield sites, since it means that companies' margins will remain healthy despite the higher extraction costs. </p> <p>But a key to the success of the smaller companies is whether they can access the infrastructure of the North Sea. After all, there is little point in extracting gas or oil if there is no way of getting it back on shore. And the oil majors control the infrastructure. \"In the past, negotiations between the smaller oil company and the oil major about access to the pipeline have caused projects to be delayed,\" said Professor Kemp. It is hoped that a new code of practice will put an end to that. </p> <p>In the future, the owner of the asset and the user will negotiate in good faith for six months. If they cannot reach an agreement after that, then the Department of Trade and Industry will be able to intervene and could approve an appropriate tariff. </p> <p>Another initiative which has been welcomed by smaller oil companies is a new licence that gives companies access to parts of the sea floor but at a lower price and for a shorter period of time than traditional licences. The companies will then have a chance to prospect the site and decide whether to develop it. </p> <p>Mr Atack is cheerful about the longer term future of Aberdeen. \"I think the higher oil price and developments in technology will encourage an increasing number of players into the market,\" he said. Developments in subsea technology will make a material difference to oil companies. Connecting oil wells on the seabed and even partially processing the oil will make life easier. </p> <p>Remote monitoring of offshore platforms and the increasing sophistication of the service industry as it matures will also contribute to future growth. </p> <p>The message from Aberdeen is clear - our overall oil reserves may be in permanent decline but there is still plenty of money to be made and no need yet for despondency.</p>",

  "<p>Bill Clinton, forced to sit out the US presidential campaign after heart bypass surgery, is expected to record a number of radio adverts at his home as the White House race enters the final straight. </p> <p>His contribution, which is likely to include a taped message for use by Democratic phonebanks, was confirmed as campaign strategists were preoccupied with the election endgame, deciding on the message and selecting the target audiences for a final blitz of TV advertising. </p> <p>Last night's televised debate was the last national moment of the election season. </p> <p>But in the 19 days remaining until polling day, the Bush and Kerry campaigns combined are expected to spend about $150m (\u00a383.6m) on television advertising, adding to the $430m so far, according to Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. </p> <p>Despite the huge amount spent, much of the message has bypassed the majority of American voters, 87% of the ads reaching only 27% of the electorate. Viewers in New York or Texas, where a swing is highly unlikely, will hardly know there is an election on. </p> <p>But those in the states picked by the Republicans and Democrats for saturation coverage can expect the final encounter between President George Bush and John Kerry to be revisited constantly in the coming fortnight. </p> <p>\"Win, lose or draw for either candidate, there will be enough soundbites for both parties to cut some ads that will try to capitalise on their momentum or to try to stop any slide coming out of the debate,\" Mr Tracey said. </p> <p>Any gaffes or perceived slips are likely to turn up in their opponent's TV ads. \"Both candidates are going to be on the attack constantly,\" said Larry Sabato of the Centre for Politics at the University of Virginia.\"This race is tight as a tick, and nobody is going to let up - because the person who is going to let up is going to lose.\" </p> <p>So far the election has been fought mainly in the 10 battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado, according to an analysis of TV advertising by the University of Wisconsin advertising project. That is a far narrower field than was originally en visaged by Kerry campaign advisers; last July they were confident of contesting as many as 20 states.But it also contradicts Republican claims that New Jersey, considered a safe state for Mr Kerry, is now in play. </p> <p>\"Whatever the campaigns are telling you about what states are in play, or are not in play, where they put their dollars shows what is really happening,\" said Joel Rivlin of the University of Wisconsin. </p> <p>The most saturated city has been Miami - a reflection of the close contest in the Florida in the 2000 election - but the Wisconsin project has also revealed a fierce battle of the airwaves in Albuquerque in New Mexico, and Reno in Nevada, as well as several cities in Ohio and Florida. That could change after last night's debate. \"They are going to try to figure out where they gained the most advantage,\" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Centre at the University of Pennsylvania. </p> <p>\"They are going to look at polls and focus groups, and see what issue resonated with their voters; and that is what they are going to focus on.\" </p> <p>So far Mr Kerry has focused on healthcare, taking up the subject in 62% of his TV adverts. Mr Bush has relied on the \"war on terror\" and national security, using such material for 46% of his campaign ads. </p> <p>Although both campaigns have resorted to attack ads, Mr Bush has been far more negative so far, attacking Mr Kerry in about 30% of his TV ads. </p> <p>As well as defining each candidate's the winning issues, the last of the televised debates usually reduces the number of states in contention, and some commentators predicted yesterday that Colorado and Minnesota may no longer be as fiercely contested. </p> <p>But it is universally expected that the battles for Florida and Ohio will intensify. </p> <p>The tradition of scaling back may also be forgotten this year as the Kerry campaign tries to learn from the mistakes made by Al Gore in 2000. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Former President George HW Bush called Michael Moore a \"slimeball\" for what he said was lies about the Bush family in Fahrenheit 9/11. In an interview with WCSH-TV, when asked his opinion of the filmmaker, he said: \"Total ass, slimeball. It was \"outrageous, his lies about my family.\"</p>",
  "Israel is set on a collision course with the EU and could turn into a pariah state, on a par with South Africa during the apartheid years, if the conflict with the Palestinians is not resolved, Israel's foreign ministry has warned. <p>In a confidential 10-year forecast obtained by the Associated Press, the ministry's Centre for Political Research said the EU is pushing to become a major global player in the next decade, and that as a result the US, Israel's main ally, could lose international influence. If the 25-member EU overcomes internal divisions and speaks in one voice, its global influence would grow considerably, and be more in line with its powerful economy, analysts wrote. Europe is Israel's major trading partner.</p> <p>Up to now, Europe has divided on major foreign policy issues, such as the war in Iraq. A more united and influential Europe would likely demand greater Israeli compliance with international conventions and could try to limit Israel's freedom of action in its conflict with the Palestinians, the document said. Israel might also have to pay a price for growing competition between the EU and the US. Israel-EU relations have long been shaky, and Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom has repeatedly warned that Israel has to work to strengthen ties with Europe. However, Israel also accuses the Europeans of pro-Palestinian bias, and complains of a growing wave of anti-Semitism in parts of Europe. </p> <p>EU officials in Brussels said that while the EU and Israel have sound relations in the areas of trade and scientific research, they have very definite differences of opinion over the Palestinians. </p> <p>\"Regarding the Middle East peace process and our relations with Israel and the Palestinians, there is no doubt that the role of the EU has increased,\" said Christina Gallach, a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. </p> <p>The EU says Israel's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 must be followed by major troop withdrawals in the West Bank, and pave the way for Palestinian statehood. \"None of this is exactly what the Israelis want to hear, but we have to say it,\" Ms Gallach said. </p> <p>She added that the Israeli government wants to broaden the relationship with Europe without giving the EU a bigger role in resolving the Middle East conflict. </p> <p>The EU's ambassador to Israel, Giancarlo Chevallard wrote on the legation's website that when it comes to the conflict, Israel \"tends to keep Europe at arms length and prefers to place all its eggs in the American basket.\"</p> <p>According to the Foreign Ministry document, which was written in August, Israel could become increasingly isolated in the coming years if Europe becomes more influential. </p> <p>\"In extreme circumstances, this could put Israel on a collision course with the European Union. Such a collision course holds the risk of Israel losing international legitimacy and could lead to its isolation, in the manner of South Africa,\" according to the document. </p> <p>Even if the EU fails to become a major international player, Israel will still become increasingly isolated if it fails to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians, according to the document. The best possible outcome - that the Middle East conflict moves toward solution - would still not put Israel and the European Union on good terms, the document said. \"In almost every scenario, there is the potential for friction in Israel-EU relations,\" the analysts wrote. </p> <p>Ron Prosor, the director of Israel's Foreign Ministry, said Israel is investing a great deal in improving ties with the EU, especially in economic areas. </p> <p>\"The situation is not easy, but there is an investment here, especially in Europe, that is important to us all,\" Prosor told Israel's Army Radio. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he will limit the number of Muslim worshippers to 50,000 at Islam's third holiest shrine, the Haram as-Sharaf or the Temple of the Mount as it is known to Jews, because of safety concerns.</p> <p>Israeli police and archaeologists have said a corner of the sacred hilltop should be roped off to prevent it from collapsing during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts tomorrow and draws large crowds to pray at the shrine. </p> <p>Authorities have said an eastern retaining wall of the compound was weakened by an earthquake in February and it is shifting.</p> <p>However, Muslim officials are refusing to meet Israel's demands, which include roping off part of the site and have quoted engineers from Jordan and Egypt as saying the shrine is safe. The chief Muslim cleric of Jerusalem, Ikrema Sabri, has accused Israel of exaggerating the danger in order to gain greater control of the site.</p> <p>Israel captured the site in the 1967 war and retains overall control of the site while Muslims run it. The site is plagued by controversy and it has been claimed the second intifada was started when Sharon, then opposition leader, visited it in 2000. In other developments today, Israeli tanks and bulldozers pulled back from the Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahiya today, after tearing up roads, flattening strawberry greenhouses and knocking down walls of dozens of houses in what residents said was the most devastating raid in four years of fighting.</p> <p>The two-day foray into Beit Lahiya was part of a major Israeli military offensive in the northern Gaza Strip, now in its third week. As part of the latest fighting, five Palestinian militants and an elderly civilian were killed in three separate missile strikes, starting yesterday evening. </p> <p>Israel says the campaign is aimed at halting Palestinian rocket fire on Israeli towns. Palestinians say much of the destruction is wanton. </p> <p>Since the September 29 start of the campaign, triggered by a deadly Palestinian rocket attack on an Israeli town, 105 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli army fire, including dozens of militants and 18 children and teens under the age of 16. </p> <p>Despite the heavy army presence in northern Gaza, Palestinian militants have continued to fire rockets and mortars at Israeli border areas and Jewish settlements in Gaza. Israeli military commentators wrote today that while an offensive might appease Israeli public opinion, it would not stop rocket fire. </p> <p>Sharon told parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee in a closed-door meeting that the offensive would continue as long as Israelis were being harmed, Israel Radio said.</p>",
  "The historian and Liberal Democrat peer Lord Russell has died aged 67, it was announced today. <p>Lord Russell, the son of the philosopher Bertrand Russell, passed away this morning after a long illness. </p> <p> The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said: \"He was a personal, political and intellectual rock of support for me. And his contribution to the development of liberalism in Britain should not be underestimated. </p> <p>\"He was a vigorous campaigner to the end, both in the Lords and for the Liberal Democrat party itself.\" </p> <p>Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell was born on April 15, 1937, and became the fifth Earl Russell in 1987. His great-grandfather was the Liberal prime minister Lord John Russell. </p> <p>He was educated at Eton and Merton College, Oxford, and became a lecturer in history at Bedford College, London. From 1979 to 1984 he taught at Yale University in the US. </p> <p>On his return to the UK, he taught at University College, London, before becoming professor of history at King's College, London, in 1990 until his retirement in 2003. </p> <p>Earl Russell wrote widely, primarily focusing on political and parliamentary history. His publications include The Causes Of The English Civil War (1990), The Fall Of The British Monarchies (1991) and An Intelligent Person's Guide To Liberalism (1999). </p> <p>In the House of Lords he focused on constitutional affairs, education and asylum, and was the party spokesman on work and pensions. </p> <p>In 1996, he was awarded the title Highland Park/Spectator Peer of the Year, and came top in the party when the elections to retain hereditary peers were held in 1999. </p> <p>He is survived by two sons. </p> <p>Lib Dem peer Lady (Shirley) Williams said: \"Conrad Russell was a liberal in every fibre of his being, from his wonderful mind to his sometimes agonised body. </p> <p>\"He was a distinctive and distinguished member of the House of Lords, a man of immense learning, elegant oratory and a gentle but perspicacious wit.\" </p> <p>Lord Russell was well known to Guardian readers, in addition to his other achievements, as an assiduous writer to the paper's letters page.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Lord McNally was today named as the next leader of the Lib Dem peers after being elected unopposed to succeed Lady Williams. </p> <p>Tom McNally, a former adviser to Labour prime minister James Callaghan, has been deputy leader since 2001 and will take over after the Queen's Speech next month. </p> <p>Lord McNally was one of the MPs who defected from the Labour party, of which he had been international secretary, to join the breakaway SDP joint-founded by Lady Williams in 1981. </p> <p>He said it was an \"enormously exciting time\" to take over the role. </p> <p>Lord McNally has been a member of the Lords since 1995 and during that time has served as party spokesman on trade, broadcasting and home affairs. </p> <p>From 1979 to 1983 he was MP for Stockport South. </p> <p>He left the Labour party to join the SDP in 1981 and served as political adviser to Paddy Ashdown from 1988-98.</p> <p>When he left Labour, Roy Hattersley sent him an acerbic telegram telling him that he \"owed the party everything\".</p>",
  "<p>Cast an eye over the many forests' worth of scientific literature on global warming and it quickly becomes clear that working out what a temperature rise of a few degrees will mean for life anywhere on the planet is far from straightforward. Vast ice sheets may melt, sea levels will rise, and faced with a new climate, species must adapt, move or perish. Yet the precise details of how any of it will happen are, frankly, unknown. </p> <p>Now it seems the future has become even more uncertain. Climate scientists say they have identified a dozen weak links around the world, regions where global warming could bring about the sudden, catastrophic collapse of vital ecosystems. The consequences will be felt far and wide. </p> <p>An abrupt halt in one ocean current could devastate Antarctic fish stocks, while disruption to another could make temperatures in Britain and elsewhere plunge. When rains return to the Sahara, disease and crop damage from pests could soar. Meanwhile, a drier Amazon will trigger huge die-back of the forests, threatening many species with extinction. Losing the forests will itself exacerbate global warming. </p> <p>Earlier this week, scientists reported that we may have less time to combat global warming than we realised. Measurements of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, taken from the Mauna Loa Observatory, 12,000ft up a mountain in Hawaii, suggest atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have risen sharply and inexplicably in the past two years, prompting fears of runaway global warming. Though it is too early to confirm that it is a definite upward trend, the results came as an unwelcome surprise to climatologists. </p> <p>Over the span of the coming century, even the most extreme global warming scenario predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - an increase of 5.8C - seems gentle. </p> <p>Surely civilisation will have enough time to protect itself against the consequences, while ecosystems could gradually adapt? Not so, say scientists studying the world's weakest links. </p> <p>John Schellnhuber, research director at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich, played a key role in identifying the dozen systems where global warming could produce sudden and dramatic environmental damage. He calls them the \"tipping points\", the achilles heels of the planet. </p> <p>At a conference earlier this year, Schellnhuber and other scientists called for a concerted, global effort to investigate the earth's known tipping points and to search for new ones. Only then, he says, will we be able to identify where the consequences will be felt first. </p> <p>\"It'll take a global effort to understand these, and we have to make sure that none are activated through human actions,\" he says. Here, we present a list of the tipping points and what might happen if they are triggered.</p> <p><strong> Sahara desert</strong><br> </p> <p>Occupying some 3.5m square miles of northern Africa, the Sahara desert is expected to shrink with global warming as more plentiful rain brings a flourish of vegetation to its southernmost reaches. </p> <p>For those on the edge of the desert, the fertile land will undoubtedly be a boon, but the Sahara plays a broader role in the health of the planet. The dry dust that is whipped up from the desert by strong prevailing winds contains crucial nutrients that seed the Atlantic and may even help fertilise the Amazon. </p> <p>As the Sahara turns from brown to green, the flux of nutrients into the ocean is expected to drop, restricting food available for plankton, the smallest of links in the marine food chain. </p> <p>As the number of plankton falls, so does food for aquatic creatures further up the food chain. </p> <p>That's not the only knock-on effect. Plankton lock up the greenhouse gas CO <sub>2 </sub> from the atmosphere, and so help counter global warming. With fewer plankton, the oceans will take less of the gas from the Earth's atmosphere. </p> <p>Dust from the Sahara has other, more subtle influences. When blown out over the Atlantic, clouds of Saharan dust act to stabilise the atmosphere, suppressing the formation of hurricanes. </p> <p>A greener Sahara could mean more frequent, or more severe hurricanes slamming into the Caribbean, parts of central and southern America and the south-eastern US. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the now wetter Saharan regions of Sudan, Morocco and Algeria could become more prone to infestations of locusts, such as the swarms that have devastated crops in the region this year.</p> <p><strong> Amazon forest</strong><br> </p> <p> The size of western Europe, the Amazon forest is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. Models suggest that with global warming will come a drop in Amazonian rainfall, leading to the gradual death of the forest and subsequent collapse of the myriad ecosystems it supports. </p> <p>The extinction of species is only one consequence of a warmer planet. As the trees die off, they will fall and rot, releasing carbon dioxide. In the worst case scenario, the quantities of CO <sub>2 </sub> emitted could be of the same order of magnitude as from the 20th century's total fossil fuel output. </p> <p>\"It's the biggest biodiversity pool on Earth and if it were lost, it would be an incredible loss for our nature capital. This is not just a fantasy. There's clearly a vulnerability here,\" says Schellnhuber. </p> <p><strong> Ozone hole</strong><br> </p> <p>Decades after many countries introduced a ban on CFCs, the danger of the ozone hole causing a nasty surprise remains very real. </p> <p>\"In a sense, this is the mother of all tipping points, and it's one that has been activated already,\" says Schellnhuber. </p> <p>Scientists are now generally agreed that global warming may drastically amplify the power of ozone-destroying chemicals, which linger in the stratosphere for decades. At high altitude, ozone acts as a shield against the sun's damaging radiation. Global warming, while heating the lower atmosphere, can lead to cooling in the stratosphere where the ozone layer forms. Cooling this band of air has a complex knock-on effect, disrupting a chemical process that prevents ozone from breaking down. The result is a loss of ozone as the world warms up. </p> <p>Though the ozone hole is often associated with Antarctica and Australia, ozone loss due to global warming could see a hole appear over parts of Europe. </p> <p>\"If it were to stretch beyond Antarctica, it would increase in an intolerable way, the risk of skin cancer and blindness,\" says Schellnhuber. </p> <p><strong> Greenland ice sheet</strong><br> </p> <p> The Greenland ice sheet holds about 2.6 million cubic kilometres of fresh water, which is some 6% of the planet's supply. It is imperative that this water remains frozen. If global warming sees temperatures rise by more than about 3C, Greenland is likely to begin a slow thaw, steadily releasing all that water - currently resting on land - into the north Atlantic Ocean. </p> <p>Climate models suggest that a more drastic temperature increase of some 8C could see the Greenland ice sheet disappear almost entirely, a thaw that would see the seven seas rise by seven metres. Such a dramatic rise in sea level would cause flooding that is bound to have a devastating impact on people living on unprotected shorelines around the globe. </p> <p>And the drowned land won't reappear for some time. \"If the Greenland ice sheet goes, it probably will not come back for the next 60,000 years,\" says Schellnhuber. </p> <p><strong> Tibetan plateau</strong><br> </p> <p>Spanning one quarter of China's entire landmass lies the Tibetan plateau. Because the region is permanently under snow and ice, it behaves like a giant mirror, reflecting the sun's rays back into space. </p> <p>The effect is to keep a lid on global warming, at least locally, as the darker soils are unable to bask in the sun's radiation and increase in temperature. </p> <p>In a warmer world, the white of the Tibetan plateau will slowly turn to brown and grey as the snow retreats to reveal the ground beneath. As the ground warms, melting will accelerate. Tibet will become a much warmer place. </p> <p><strong> Salinity valves</strong><br> </p> <p> In some parts of the world, local geography conspires to pinch the waters between adjacent seas into separate bodies of water. If one is saltier than the other, a flux of salt, nutrients and oxygen can be set up across the gap, producing what scientists refer to as a salinity valve. </p> <p>Arguably the most significant salinity valve is the Strait of Gibraltar, acting as a pinch between the Mediterranean and the north Atlantic Ocean. The gradients across the valves give rise to unique ecosystems that are highly adapted to local conditions. </p> <p>As global warming is expected to disrupt ocean currents, by warming the seas and diluting the surface waters that drive other water circulations, marine life around salinity valves could in turn face major disruption. </p> <p>\"Everything is in a balance now, all the ecosystems have adapted to a certain salinity,\" says Schellnhuber. If conditions around salinity valves change rapidly, those ecosystems might not be able to adapt quickly enough to survive. </p> <p>\"The Mediterranean is very fragile already. It could have an extremely negative effect for several decades,\" adds Schellnhuber. </p> <p><strong> North Atlantic current</strong><br> </p> <p> The North Atlantic current is one of the strongest ocean currents in the world, of which the Gulf stream is the precursor. </p> <p>It works like a conveyer belt. Surface water in the North Atlantic is first cooled by westerly winds from North America, making the water more dense and salty so it sinks to the ocean floor before moving towards the equator. Driven by winds and replacing the cold water moving south, warm water from the Gulf of Mexico moves upward into the Atlantic. </p> <p>The effect of the current on climate is dramatic. It brings to Europe the equivalent of 100,000 large power stations' worth of free heating, propping up temperatures by in excess of 10C in some parts. </p> <p>Global warming could change all that, though not very quickly. Computer models predict that as global warming increases, so will rainfall in the North Atlantic. Gradually, the heavier rains will dilute the sea water and make it less likely to sink, a process that could bring the whole conveyer to a gradual halt. </p> <p>\"It won't happen in a matter of weeks, like in the movie The Day After Tomorrow, but it could happen over a few decades,\" says Schellnhuber. </p> <p>In the past 50,000 years, the current has stopped at least seven times. Collapse of the North Atlantic current would hit Iceland, Scotland and Norway most, where temperatures could drop 10C or more. If it happened soon, we would notice a difference. But in 100 years, when global temperatures may be a few degrees higher anyway, temperatures may simply revert back to today's levels. Total shutdown of the current would lead to a rapid regional sea level rise of around 1m along UK the coast as the ocean adjusts to the change. </p> <p><strong> El Ni\u00f1o</strong><br> The disruption caused by El Ni\u00f1o is well known, from droughts in Asia and Australia to flooding in regions such as Ecuador and northern Peru. The Peruvians gave El Ni\u00f1o its name, derived from the Spanish for \"the boy child\". El Ni\u00f1o was originally used to describe a warm ocean current that arrived around Christmas time. </p> <p>Nowadays, the term refers to a general warming of the central and Asian Pacific, which causes a major shift in weather pattern and in particular responds sensitively to changes at the western boundary of the Pacific. El Ni\u00f1os are already somewhat erratic, occurring every two to seven years, but some models suggest global warming could make El Ni\u00f1os not just more severe but more frequent. </p> <p>The impact on agriculture and so food production could be serious. Indonesia, the Philippines, south-east Asia and Eastern Australia could face damaging droughts while the heavy rains and flooding cause problems for the northwestern regions of South America. </p> <p><strong> West Antarctic ice sheet</strong><br> </p> <p> The giant West Antarctic ice sheet is not about to melt any time soon - the ice is up to a kilometre thick - but two years ago a vast chunk, the Larsen B ice shelf, broke off the eastern side of the Antarctic peninsula and fragmented into icebergs. In just 35 days, about 3,250 square kilometres of ice was lost; the size of the entire shelf is now roughly 40% the size at which it had previously stabilised. </p> <p>Some predictions suggest that the rest of the sheet could feel the force of global warming quickly. Should the entire sheet melt, it is estimated the sea level rise around the world would top 6m. Once more, coastal regions would be under threat. </p> <p><strong> Methane clathrates</strong><br> </p> <p> Deep within the Siberian permafrost and ocean floor sediments lie vast deposits of gas-filled ice called methane clathrates. </p> <p>At Siberian temperatures, or under the weight of icy oceans, the clathrates are stable. But as global warming takes effect, the icy crystals that clutch the gas could rupture, releasing it into the oceans and atmosphere. </p> <p>According to the US Geological Survey, some 10 to 11 trillion tonnes of carbon are locked up in clathrates in ocean floor deposits, the equivalent of 20 times the known reserves of natural gas. Some scientists believe sudden releases of methane from clathrates caused a severe environmental impact in the past. </p> <p>If released into the atmosphere, methane from clathrates could exacerbate global warming. Some estimates suggest that since methane is such a strong greenhouse gas, a significant release could increase global warming by up to 25%. More likely, some scientists say, is that released methane poisons the oceans or oxidises and dissolves as carbon dioxide as it rises, which would still be toxic to some species. </p> <p><strong> The monsoon</strong><br> </p> <p> During March and April, the Indian subcontinent begins to heat up, reaching some of the highest surface temperatures of the year by May. The hot land produces a sharp temperature gradient between the land and sea which causes an abruptreversal of the winds from seaward to landward. </p> <p>As the winds strike the Himalayas and are deflected upwards, they create a low pressure system, forcing rainclouds to release their stores of water. While the monsoon season can cause incredible flood damage, local populations are largely adapted and to some extent reliant on the weather. </p> <p>If global warming has the expected effect of heating India even more, the monsoon season could become far more severe. What happens will be influenced by the level of pollution in the region. Sulphur dioxide and even dust make rain droplets smaller and so diminish overall rainfall. These substances also increase the reflectivity of clouds, which prevents the ground from heating up so much. </p> <p>Both of these factors would weaken the monsoon, causing havoc for Indian agriculture, with serious consequences for food production.</p> <p><strong> The Atlantic circumpolar current</strong><br> </p> <p> Some scientists believe the Atlantic circumpolar current to be the most significant on the planet. It swirls some 140m cubic metres of water around Antarctica every second, mixing water from the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans as it goes. </p> <p>The current taps into another circulation that sees cold surface water sink while warmer water rises, bringing with it vital nutrients from dead plankton (left) and other marine life on the ocean floor. </p> <p>Global warming is expected to produce more rainfall over the poles, which could slow the rise of nutrients for dispersal by the Atlantic circumpolar current. </p> <p>\"For marine life, any change in the currents is extremely important,\" says Schellnhuber.</p>",

  "<p>\"I confess that I've never watched a presidential debate in an atmosphere so reminiscent of a pro wrestling crowd.\" So writes John Hinderaker of the pro-Bush <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/\">Powerline </a>blog. He was at the Minneapolis Hilton last night, along with the people behind <a href=\"http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/\">Captain's Quarters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shotinthedark.info/\">Shot in the Dark </a>and others in the \"patriotic\" camp.</p> <p>If you ever wondered what a party of bloggers sat round a table in a hotel ballroom looked like now is your chance to <a href=\"http://powerlineblog.com/archives/008179.php\">check out the photographs</a>.</p> <p>In terms of style and presentation, the last debate was closer than the previous two. Mr Bush had ditched his sometimes petulant air for warmth and charm, and, in some of the answers at least, Hinderaker felt he had something to cheer for. \"For me, the defining moment came near the end, when moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS asked the candidates an open-ended question about religion. Bush's answer was perfect: straightforward, inclusive, heartfelt.\"</p> <p>But he still hesitates to put it in the win column for the president. \"On the whole I thought that Kerry did somewhat better than Bush on the ordinary domestic policy issues. He was almost always on the attack and was better able to back up his arguments with (often misleading) data. On the other hand, Bush did better than Kerry on the 'social' or 'values' issues.\"</p> <p>The same analysis is shared by Andrew Sullivan's <a href=\"http://www.andrewsullivan.com/\">Daily Dish</a>, a blog moving away from the president with some reservations. Even so, his \"<a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_10_10_dish_archive.html#109772584733900818\">big surprise</a>\" is that Mr Kerry won the exchanges on fiscal discipline, guns and immigration. \"I sat slack-jawed as I watched Kerry clearly seem tougher on illegal immigrants than Bush! This is Bush's big weakness with his base.\"</p> <p>Those at the pro-Kerry <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos</a> are delighted by the instant or near-instant polls that cast the encounter as a tie or a clear win for the senator (set out on <a href=\"http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/index.php\">Donkey Rising</a>).

  "<p>After a strangely subdued first Test, the mayhem expected from this series arrived as Australia felt the heat on a scorching first day in Chennai.</p> <p>After Australia, who won the toss, blazed to 136 for 0 and then 189 for 2, Anil Kumble absolutely shredded them. Starting with the wicket of Damien Martyn from the last ball before tea, he took seven wickets on the spin and effected the run-out that ended the innings.</p> <p>It was absolute pandemonium: Australia collapsed to 235 all out, and though India lost Yuvraj Singh - caught behing slashing at Shane Warne, who thus equals Muttiah Muralitharan as the leading wicket-taker in Test history on 532 - to end on 28 for 1, there is no doubt who is in control after the first day.</p> <p>The day had started so well for Australia, with Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden plundering yet another century opening partnership.</p> <p>But, as is usually the case when Australia play in India, the introduction of the home spinners changed the mood. The stand had reached 136 when Hayden, having already struck two sixes in his 58, was caught by VVS Laxman just inside the long-on boundary attempting to launch Harbhajan Singh over the ropes.</p> <p>Justin Langer (71) went two balls later, snicking Harbhajan to Rahul Dravid at slip, but the ice-cool Simon Katich and Damien Martyn had quietly restored Australia's authority as tea approached. Then, the turning point. Martyn, who made 26, gloved the last ball of the session to short leg, and Kumble was away.</p> <p>Darren Lehmann, essaying an ugly, crooked cut shot, was caught behind without scoring; Michael Clarke was pinned lbw on the back foot by a topspinner, and Adam Gilchrist, lunging forward dangerously on a pitch offering copious bounce for the spinners, walked after bat-padding to short leg.</p> <p>Australia, under excruciating pressure for the first time in the series, found their Indian demons resurfacing, and the tail was blown away in a flash: Warne slapped a return catch, Jason Gillespie was snaffled at short leg, and Michael Kasprowicz also walked - even though David Shepherd had already given him not out and called 'over' - after inside-edging Kumble onto his pad.</p> <p>The denouement of Australia's innings - the ridiculous run-out of Glenn McGrath - reflected the blind panic that had set in. For them, it was all depressingly familiar: none of the bottom seven had reached double figures, and the almighty collapse - ten wickets for 99, seven wickets for 44 - was proof that when the Indian kitchen is at its hottest, their batsmen simply do not have the answers.</p> <p>They know it, all of India knows it, and when the post-mortem of this series is conducted, there is every chance that this will be recognised as the day the momentum changed irrevocably.</p>",
  "Ahmed was only half-joking when he told the audience at this week's New York Arab-American Comedy Festival: \"I can't fly anywhere.\" <p>\"It's such a bad time to be an Ahmed, and my name's Ahmed Ahmed, so it's really fucking bad,\" said the Californian-Egyptian Muslim, who returned from the recent Edinburgh Festival with an ethnic comedy award. </p> <p>Here in a packed basement club in midtown Manhattan, the laughs were flowing from empathy and shared experience, rather than Scottish sympathy. The largely Arab-American crowd are learning to make fun of the predicament they find themselves in since becoming the country's least favoured - and perhaps least understood - ethnic group. </p> <p>Ten performers were featured during the festival's \"new faces\" set, and almost every comic dwelt on how life has changed for the worse since the September 11 attacks. Much of the material was based on real-life encounters with over-bearing authority figures at airports, immigration services and the local police precinct. It was wryly informative and anecdotal, rather than thigh-slappingly funny. </p> <p>But as every established ethnic minority in America knows, laughter and self-mockery is one way to bind a people together in the face of adversity. </p> <p>\"I read a statistic that said hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims went up over 1000%, right after September 11, which still put us in fourth-place behind blacks, gays and Jews,\" said Ahmed. \"So what the fuck do we have to do? We can't even win in hatred.\" </p> <p>There is nothing coincidental about the existence and timing of the festival. This is its second year, and the four-day event has drawn on Arab actors, comics, playwrights and filmmakers from all around the country. It was scheduled deliberately for mid-October, to draw attention to the looming presidential elections. </p> <p>\"Everybody's defining us, but we need to define ourselves,\" said Elias El-Hage, founding co-producer and general manager of the festival. \"This is our opportunity to do so...Even if they feel they won't be open to the subject matter, when you get people to laugh, they open up. They see the other side.\" It is a non-profit venture, but El-Hage is happy to concede that it is also about career building and fuelling the \"community of Arab-American artists that are out there\". </p> <p>Before the mike was even turned on, it was clear from the two T-shirts taped to the back wall of the stage, that politics and protest against the Bush administration would underpin the laughter. With voter registration now complete, the shirts read simply: \"Yalla - Vote.\"</p> <p>The Arab-American vote has never been hotly sought-after by any presidential candidate in the past, but there are significant communities in many of the swing states. Florida and New Jersey have a quarter of a million each, while Ohio and Pennsylvania have around 150,000 each. </p> <p>In 2000, George Bush secured just over 45% of the Arab-American vote, compared with 38% for Gore. Ralph Nader scored a remarkable 13%. Some 90% of Arab-Americans registered for the last election, and political consciousness is bound to be even higher this year, given the security backlash. </p> <p>There was no cheerleading for Kerry on the comedy stage, but anger towards Bush and despair at the ignorance of Middle America, was profound. Compere Dean Obeidallah's bitter-sweet gag was typical of the mood: </p> <p>\"Every other ethnic group gets months which identify with their culture. There's Black History Month, Hispanic Awareness month ... What do we get? Orange Alert.\" </p> <p>Many of the anti-establishment barbs were not Arab-specific, but the funniest ones were. Several performers laid into the futility of suicide bombing, while at the same time supporting the wider political argument. \"We're all Arab and it's only my opinion, but for the time being, we're all Palestinian too,\" said one as an aside.</p> <p>Withering jokes about the lack of democratic freedom and women's rights in the Middle East, together with gently mocking anecdotes about parental misunderstanding, painted a picture of a hugely diverse community that includes Muslim, Christian and Jew. </p> <p>One female performer described her horror at finding that a girlfriend's Arabic name meant exactly the same thing as her own: \"big black eyes like a cow\". Another gave sarcastic thanks to his parents for giving him the name Shahed. \"How do you come up with a name like that for a kid you know is growing up in the US ...'This is our son, Shit-Head'.\" </p> <p>The warm reception for this curious blend of comedy, culture and politics was to be expected in the bosom of liberal New York, but I asked Elias El-Hage whether he felt it would work in the Bush heartlands. Would an Anglo-Saxon audience be laughing there? </p> <p>\"Palestine, Arkansas, wouldn't get it. Somebody did research there and they just don't realise what Palestine means to an Arab-American. So not now, but in five or 10 years, I believe we'll be able to go anywhere in this country,\" he said. </p> <p>As for the Arab-American audience at the Improv Comedy Club, there were definite signs of a very different mood going into this 2004 contest, compared with four years ago. Mohannad Aama, who works for a capital management company on Wall Street, said his parents had voted for Bush, but things were different now. </p> <p>\"I am still undecided myself. What is going for Bush is that you know where he stands, whereas I still don't trust what Kerry is saying. My real concerns though are with the crew Bush brought in - the Neo-Conservatives.\" </p> <p>A young Arab-American New Yorker, Nora Farid, was beaming as she headed towards the exit. \"It really hit home. It really touched the heart,\" she said, admitting that this was her first trip to a comedy club. </p> <p>\"Since 9-11, a lot of us have been coming together whereas before, we didn't seek each other out,\" she said. \"A lot of new groups are popping up everywhere. I don't think Bush is going to be getting many votes from us this time round.\"</p> <p>A Muslim American audience member, Imran Khan, told me that disquiet among Arab-Americans was even more pronounced within the Islamic community in general. </p> <p>\"I didn't much care about it then, but this time I really want Kerry to win because I think Bush is not doing the right job,\" he said. \"Kerry is all over the place on Iraq right now too, but he knows how to negotiate. That's what it requires. People hate Bush outside the US, that's a fact.\"</p>",
  "The series of presidential debates that have transformed the US election campaign ended last night in Arizona, with President George Bush characterising his opponent as a politician on the \"far left\" of the political mainstream, and Senator John Kerry attacking the president's record on jobs, the economy, healthcare and Iraq. <p>Instant polls on the debate suggested that the result of the confrontation was another victory for the Democratic candidate, with some news organisations giving Senator Kerry posting a lead of between 1% (on ABC) and 14% (CBS). However, other polls indicated a draw, with neither candidate deemed to have landed a killer blow.</p> <p>The third and final debate, which focused on domestic issues and the economy, came less than three weeks before polling day on November 2. </p> <p>The impact of the debates on voting intention has been pronounced. At the beginning of the debates, President Bush held a steady 11% lead. Today that lead has evaporated, with most polls putting the two candidates neck and neck.</p> <p>The 90-minute debate, with the two candidates standing behind lecterns, followed a pattern, with President Bush choosing to talk in terms of big ideals and Senator Kerry trying to nail the incumbent on his record. </p> <p>The two men's stylistic differences were also in evidence: President Bush attempted to engage the audience with jokes which, while they might work on the stump, fell flat with an audience that had agreed to remain silent; Senator Kerry did his best to erase his reputation as a wordy policy wonk by looking directly at the camera to deliver firm, short answers.</p> <p>The first question, about whether America could ever be safe again, was met with a resounding \"Yes. We absolutely must be,\" from Senator Kerry. But his old habits tripped him up at times, particularly during an extended answer on the outsourcing of US jobs to overseas.</p> <p>President Bush, by contrast, mainly steered clear of specifics, and of discussing his record. \"I went to Washington to solve problems,\" he said when talking about education, a theme the president brought up many times during the debate. \"I've got four more years to go, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards.\"</p> <p>Although the scowls and visible signs of irritation, so marked in the first debate, were largely absent from President Bush's performance, there were still times when he seemed to cross the thin line between passion and anger. A discussion of the arcane details of social security reform left President Bush frowning and looking annoyed.</p> <p>But, as with every debate, a moment arrived when the two men were given the opportunity to show their human side. Asked by the moderator, CBS news presenter Bob Schieffer, what they had learned from the strong women in their families, President Bush, referring to criticisms of his performance in the first debate, said: \"To listen to them. To stand up straight and not scowl.\" Although the comments drew the first laughter of the evening, it is widely believed that the Bush camp strategist Karen Hughes, not the First Lady, was the person to give that advice to the president.</p> <p>Senator Kerry responded to the same question by talking about his mother. But he also showed a self-deprecating side not often seen in public. \"I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up,\" he said to Mr Schieffer. \"And,\" he added, in reference to his marriage to the heiress to the Heinz fortune, \"some would say maybe me more so than others.\"</p> <p>Security and Iraq came up, with Mr Kerry blaming President Bush for rushing into the Iraq war and pushing away allies. \"As a result America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be,\" he said. \"We can do a better job of homeland security.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush responded that America would be safe \"if we stay on the offence against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world\".</p> <p>But domestic issues, ranging from healthcare to the debt burden to social security reform, immigration and affirmative action, dominated the evening. And the answers to a question about abortion rights gave a clear indication of the candidates' different visions for the US. Asked whether he would like to overturn Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that established the legal right to abortion, President Bush's answer, in its entirety, was: \"What he's asking me is will I have a litmus test for my judges? And the answer is no, I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.\"</p> <p>In contrast to the president's brevity, Senator Kerry used his 90-second allocation to argue that \"the right of choice is a constitutional right. So I don't intend to see it undone. Clearly the president wants to leave it in ambivalence or intends to undo it.\"</p> <p>That led into a discussion of the role of faith in politics. In his most eloquent passage of the evening, President Bush said: \"Prayer and religion sustain me. I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency ... But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am.\"</p> <p>Senator Kerry responded, \"Frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbour to do in this country and on this planet.\"</p> <p>Attempting to paint his opponent as a liberal who is out of step with ordinary Americans Mr Bush said: \"There's a mainstream of American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.\" On tax, Mr Bush accused his challenger of planning increases on top of the repeal Mr Kerry has announced of tax cuts for those earning more than $200,000. \"There is a tax gap, and guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class,\" he said. He added that Mr Kerry's healthcare proposal would cost $5 trillion over 10 years. </p> <p>Mr Kerry riposted that he did not like to be lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility. \"This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see,\" he said.</p> <p>Senator Kerry made a point of addressing women voters and the electorate in Arizona. Women voters are essential to a Kerry victory - men poll heavily in favour of President Bush - while Arizona has gone from being a swing state to being a safe Bush state to, in the last 10 days, being a swing state once again. A poll released this week gave the president a 5% lead, with a 5% margin of error.</p> <p>The only time the debate touched on Britain was in a discussion of the shortage of flu vaccines in the US following a decision by British authorities to remove the licence from the subsidiary of a US company producing them in Liverpool. While Senator Kerry took the episode as an indicator of the poor state of healthcare under the Bush administration, the president tried to claim credit for the move, saying: \"We relied on a company out of England to produce about half of the flu vaccines ... we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country ... My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year.\"</p> <p>Asked why the president had suggested that it was the fault of a foreign company and that the US government and not British health authorities had decided to revoke the company's licence, Bush campaign manager Ken Mehlman, said: \"I can't answer that question.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Ferreiras, the EastEnders family branded \"unbelievable and unrealistic\" by Asian viewers, have been axed in one of the first moves to turn around the struggling soap by new executive producer Kathleen Hutchison.</p> <p>Ash, Kareena, Ronny and Adi Ferreira will leave Albert Square next spring, along with half brother Tariq and taxi operator Sasha - less than two years after joining the BBC1 soap.</p> <p>Family patriarch Dan has already been written out of EastEnders, after the actor who plays the character, Bollywood star Dalip Tahil, was banned from working in the UK because of visa problems.</p> <p>The BBC said the actors who play the Ferreiras - Ameet Chana, Raji James, Ray Panthaki, Pooja Shah, Nabil Elouahabi and Jemma Walker - were leaving the soap \"by mutual consent\".</p> <p>\"Their acting ability has been been outstanding and we'd like to thank them for their professionalism,\" a BBC spokeswoman said.</p> <p>The Ferreiras have borne the brunt of the critical flak flying at EastEnders in recent months, with reviewers branding storylines involving the Asian clan \"boring\".</p> <p>For a while the BBC seemed oblivious to the criticism.</p> <p>But at the Edinburgh TV festival in August the BBC1 controller, Lorraine Heggessey, implied in an exchange with Daily Mail soap critic Jaci Stephen that it was only the out of touch Mail that didn't rate the Asian family.</p> <p>However, she admitted that one of the storylines - a kidney donation between two of the Ferreira brothers - had been unexpectedly drawn out because of cast problems.</p> <p>\"I would admit that EastEnders has had problems, but when you have a cast where one is ill, one pregnant and one maybe in re-hab; another in a car crash, you get [a situation] where you become overdependent on a story line about a kidney transplant,\" she said.</p> <p>Storylines involving the Ferreiras since their arrival in Albert Square have included Dan abandoning his offspring, Tariq donating a kidney to Ronnie - after it emerged that he was actually a half-brother to the Ferreira children - and the family having their house repossessed.</p> <p>The most damning verdict, however, came from Asian viewers surveyed by online magazine Britainsasianassets.com earlier this year.</p> <p>\"The Ferreiras? Crap, unbelievable characters, negative storylines, totally unrealistic,\" one 20-year-old student told the survey.</p> <p>A twentysomething female journalist added: \"Shoot them all. None of them can act. They don't look like a family. How do you get a Tariq, a Ronnie, a Kareena and an Ash in one family? And Ferreira, how does that add up? It's lazy casting.\"</p> <p>\"Tariq is a muslim name, Kareena is Hindu, Ash is a bit of a catch-all - it could be Muslim or Hindu - and Ronnie, where does that come from? Plus they have a Portugese surname, so why aren't they Catholic?\" said barrister Rehna Azim, who conducted the survey.</p> <p>The house possession storyline was also criticised by Asian viewers in the poll who said repossession is unlikely in Asian culture where extended family would step into the breach. </p> <p>However, former EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge, who introduced the Ferreiras in July 2003, said her team had conducted two years' research before introducing the Asian family.</p> <p>Ms Berridge quit last month to be replaced by Ms Hutchison, the executive producer of Holby City.</p> <p>The five-strong Ferreira family, who are apparently from Goa in India, were the first new Asian family to move into Walford since Gita and Sanjay Kapoor left in 1998. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "John Kerry said last night that George Bush bears responsibility for a misguided war in Iraq, lost jobs at home and a rising number of Americans without health care. <p>The incumbent cast his rival in campaign debate as a lifelong liberal bent on raising taxes and government spending.</p> <p>\"There's a mainstream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank,\" President George Bush said in the final debate of a close and contentious campaign for the White House. \"Your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.\"</p> <p>But the Democratic challenger said many of the nation's ills can be laid at Bush's feet.</p> <p>He \"regrettably rushed us into war\" in Iraq, Mr Kerry said, and is the first White House occupant in seven decades to preside over a net loss of jobs.</p> <p>As for health care, the Democratic senator said, \"five million Americans have lost\" coverage under Bush's watch. \"The president has turned his back on the wellness of America, and there is no system and it's starting to fall apart,\" Mr Kerry said.</p> <p>Kerry and the president also debated abortion, gay rights, immigration and more in a 90-minute debate that underscored their deep differences.</p> <p>This debate was similar in format to the first - the two rivals standing behind identical lecterns set precisely 10 feet (3 metres) apart. </p> <p>The night's first question was whether America could ever be as safe as it was in a pre-terrorist world, and Kerry swiftly turned his answer into an attack on Bush.</p> <p>The president \"regrettably rushed us into war,\" he said, and added that the president had \"pushed alliances away and as a result America is not bearing this enormous burden where safe is not as safe as we ought to be.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush spoke dismissively of his rival.</p> <p>\"My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling,\" he said. \"I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.\"</p> <p>Taxes was a particular flash point between the two men.</p> <p>Questioned by moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS, Mr Kerry said he would follow through on his plan to roll back tax cuts for Americans who earn more than $200,000 (\u00a3111,000) a year while preserving the reductions that have gone to lower and middle income wage earners. Under Bush, he said, the tax burden of the wealthy has gone down and that of the middle class has gone up. But Bush said Kerry would never stick to his promise, and his election would mean higher taxes for all.</p> <p>The two men disagreed over abortion, Mr Kerry saying the choice should be \"between a woman, God and her doctor,\" and the president saying he wants to promote a \"culture of life.\"</p> <p>Asked directly whether he supports overturning the 1973 supreme curt ruling that gave women the right to abortion, Mr Bush sidestepped. \"What you're asking me is will I have a litmus test for my judges, and the answer is no,\" the president said.</p> <p>The president dodged a bit, too, when the issue of a minimum wage increase came up. Kerry said emphatically he favours one, and said that Republicans in control of Congress had repeatedly blocked Democratic attempts to pass legislation.</p> <p>Bush and Kerry agreed on one point, stating that marriage should be preserved for heterosexual couples. But they gave different answers when asked about whether homosexuality was a choice.</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" said the president. Mr Kerry referred to vice-president Dick Cheney's gay daughter, and said it was not a choice. \"We're all God's children,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked about the catholic bishops who have advised parishioners it would be a sin to vote for a candidate who supports abortion rights, Kerry evoked the name of John F Kennedy, another Massachusetts senator and the first catholic elected president.</p> <p>He quoted Kennedy's famous 1960 campaign statement in which he said he wasn't running to become a Catholic president, but the first president who happens to be a catholic.</p>",
  "Detainees held at Belmarsh high security prison without charge or trial have become seriously clinically depressed and are suffering from anxiety, with a number becoming psychotic as a result of their indefinite detention, a report by some of the country's top psychiatrists concludes. <p>Some of the men have suicidal thoughts and many have self-harmed, ranging from cutting their bodies to attempts at hanging, according to doctors.</p> <p>Eleven men are detained under anti-terrorism legislation because the home secretary, David Blunkett, believes that they are a risk to national security. One is held at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital because his mental health deteriorated whilst at Belmarsh. Another, identified as G, is under house arrest because he is too sick to remain at the prison.</p> <p>The report concludes that the men's mental state has declined because of the \"sense of helplessness and hopelessness which is an integral aspect of indefinite detention\".</p> <p>It says: \"There is a strong consensus that indefinite detention is linked to deterioration in mental health and that fluctuations in mental state are related to the prison regime and to the vagaries of the appeal system.\"</p> <p>Three of the men's wives are also suffering from depression as a result of their husbands' detention. One is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing her husband's arrest and another is said to have a \"phobic anxiety state\".</p> <p>The report says: \"Concern with regard to their wives' mental state is exacerbating the mental health problems of many detainees.\" Some of the detainees suffered mental health problems before their detention but this has been seriously exacerbated, the specialists conclude. The report has been compiled by psychiatrists including Professor Ian Robbins at St George's hospital in London and Dr James McKeith of the South London and Maudsley NHS trust.</p> <p>Last May, the Guardian visited one of the detainees, Mahmoud Abu Rideh, at Broadmoor. The hospital said that he was not sufficiently ill to be detained there, but to send him back to Belmarsh would lead to a further deterioration, resulting in him being in a Catch-22 mental health limbo.</p> <p>Last April, the first detainee to be released without charge from Belmarsh, M, told the Guardian that a number of his fellow inmates had become \"mad, exactly mad\". G was released on bail on the orders of the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) - and to the fury of the home secretary - because he had become mentally deranged in prison.</p> <p>Last month the home secretary released another detainee after almost three years without charge. He was among the first alleged terrorists to be detained under the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001. The Algerian national, identified only as D, was said by Siac to have a \"long history of involvement in terrorist support activity\".</p> <p>Last night a prison service spokeswoman said: \"All people held at Belmarsh have access to 24-hour healthcare on the basis of clinical need.\"</p>",
  "<p>After winning the Brent East byelection in September last year, parliament's youngest MP, Sarah Teather suddenly found herself without an office. The temporary lease on her campaign office had run out and her official one wasn't ready. It meant, having promised during the election that she'd be an accessible MP, she didn't even have a phone line.</p> <p>\"I was in an abject panic in case people were trying to contact me,\" she remembers. \"I didn't sleep for weeks, it was the most stressful period of my life.\"</p> <p>Nowadays, the diminutive 30-year-old Liberal Democrat MP is used to making the journey from her north London constituency office to her one at the House of Commons and today celebrates her first year since taking up her seat.</p> <p>During that time, she has spoken in parliament nine times, asked 81 written questions, and appeared on Question Time twice. She says she has been an \"unashamedly local campaigner\", focusing her efforts on issues such as cleaning up Brent and tackling the problem that while it has inner London problems, the council has outer London funding.</p> <p>Brent has a very ethnically diverse population - in the last census 22% of the population were Hindi, and 11% Muslim. She has also been helping individuals with unresolved asylum claims, as well as aiding the families of two constituents who are being held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, taking the family of one to meet the foreign secretary, Jack Straw. But she admits to finding it hard to raise issues.</p> <p>\"You expect people will be waiting to listen to your erudite words, but it is quite difficult to get called to speak in the House of Commons, so I had to learn that you have to look for other ways to raise things,\" she says.</p> <p>Brent is one of three London boroughs where the number of people from ethnic \"minorities\" now outnumbers the native population, according to the census of 2001.</p> <p>Many people who attend her surgeries in Brent don't have English as a first language, so she is learning Gujarati, which has raised some eyebrows on the doorsteps, even though she's still at an early stage and has only just learned how to order a kilo of apples. She says it has been fascinating representing such a diverse community and says the many different groups have been very good at sending her briefings as well as meeting her regularly. Their concerns are an interesting mix of the international and the local.</p> <p>\"The one issue that unites them all is parking,\" she says. \"It is quite a problem, particularly for the mosques because they worship on a Friday. But you also have to think of local residents, so it is a difficult issue to balance.\"</p> <p>For now her ambitious are focused on being re-elected. But she says that her generation of Lib Dems expect the party to be in government during their careers and she hopes to serve in that government. In the coming election she says it is \"obvious\" the Lib Dems are going to make gains, and she particularly hopes that there will be more female Lib Dem MPs to add to the six there are currently.</p> <p>In terms of her own seat, which she won with a 29% swing from Labour, she says she is confident but not complacent that she will hold on to it at the next general election. She points to the fact that people are still joining the party locally and coming into her office saying they want to help, and she doesn't want to even consider the possibility of losing.</p> <p>\"It is looking very positive for us,\" she says, \"and I also know how hard I'm going to work between now and the election. I don't think about the worst scenario. I think there can only be a Plan A.\"</p>",
  "The shots are not quite as loud as you might expect them to be, but still they are too close for comfort.

A sharp voice shouts: \"Contact to our left, three or four rounds.\" Seconds later, there is a small burst of fire. <p>They call it a contact and what it means is that somebody, somewhere, shot at British troops.

Colour Sergeant Keith Irving from Hawick in the Scottish Borders is in charge of this expedition, and is standing on a street outside the community centre, watching for possible trouble, his SA80 rifle at the ready. He is surrounded by dozens of cheeky-faced children shouting, \"Mister, mister, Saddam donkey,\" while showing him the soles of their feet. But as the convoy pulls off later, the children's faces turn resentful and they start throwing stones. </p> <p>It's just another day for the Territorial Army soldiers serving in Iraq - people who, most of the time, live daily lives every bit as ordinary and banal as yours or mine, but who find themselves, in times of war, called upon to do an extraordinary second job in a very dangerous place. The mobilisation of reservists for the war in Iraq was the biggest since the Suez Crisis, and it continues to grow through the postwar phase. There are 1,210 Territorial Army soldiers serving on Op Telic 4, as the current operation in Iraq is known, making up 14% of the 8,069-strong British force. Roughly 10% of the TA contingent are female, many of them nurses. </p> <p>As the British army has come to rely ever more heavily on part-time soldiers, the contrast between the jobs they do at home and what they do in \"theatre\", as the military call the Iraqi conflict zone, has become more striking than ever. There is the Calor Gas tanker driver who is currently gathering intelligence; the joiner who runs a job creation scheme for Iraqi people; the marketing officer for the National Archive at Kew who now spends his days trying to liaise with public service officials; as well as the mechanics, plumbers and City analysts doing guard duty. Then there are those on a busman's holiday of sorts: the two electricity specialists working on the Basra power grid; the doctors and nurses working in the military field hospital; the chefs now preparing meals for thousands of soldiers stationed in the desert. </p> <p>The soldiers from 52nd Lowland Regiment have spent most of their time in Iraq on force protection, interspersed with what they consider the more boring job - guard duty. They are coming to the end of their six-month stint in Amara and their morale is still pretty high. At home, they belong to various TA units, training in their different bases in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Ayr and other towns across Scotland during the week, coming together as a brigade at periodic short residential camps. While they may have met each other's wives and families at dances and other TA events, they don't like to talk about home too much. </p> <p>Irving, the broad-accented Scotsman, is typical of the TA soldiers here in that he believes that he is just as professional as any regular in the field. He served in the regulars for five years, then signed up with the TA 10 years after leaving the forces. \"Having seen it from both sides of the fence, I think commitment-wise the TA guy is the better soldier,\" he says. We are standing outside a British-funded blacksmith's shop. Inside, the owner is telling the MoD man that he is now employing five members of his family because of the funds he received to kit out his workshop. The MoD man is happy, even though this marks just a small success in terms of the British attempt to help rebuild the country. </p> <p>Outside on the street there is a perception that the tension is mounting. The road is busy with cars and bicycles and people, all of them staring: most don't look particularly friendly. It's not the numbers on the street you need to worry about, says Irving, it's when the crowd suddenly disappears that you know something might go wrong. I ask him if he ever gets scared. He shrugs his shoulders and quips: \"Wit's for ye will no go by ye,\" a fatalistic Scottish expression which means whatever happens happens. In his other life, Irving delivers medical oxygen across the Borders of Scotland. </p> <p> *** </p> <p>Another day, another scene. It is just past 7am and a watery sun is burning a hazy white light across the flat landscape that British soldiers have taken to calling the \"Gifa\". Territorial army fusilier Michael Greville explains that it means the \"great Iraqi fuck all\". </p> <p>Greville is 26, and usually works as a credit analyst for Cazenove, a city investment bank. It's an office-bound job and most days he finds himself by a computer. In Iraq, when he is not soldiering, he goes back to his accommodation to study his notes for the chartered financial analyst exam which he hopes to take next year: \"When I am really bored, which is pretty much 12 hours a day when we are not working, I go back to my room and study.\" Being here means he is missing out on his city bonuses, but Greville is enjoying the tour anyway. </p> <p>This morning some of Four Platoon from Messines Company, the London Regiment, are on their way north, escorting three vehicles from the British divisional headquarters at Basra airbase to the Dutch army camp near the town of Samawa, south of the flashpoint city of Najaf. Like 52 Lowland, they provide armed escort and covering fire should the convoy of regular troops meet any insurgency on the road. </p> <p>They may work alongside the regulars, but ultimately all the TA soldiers in Iraq are under the command of the British Forces General Officer Commanding Major General Rollo, who is a regular soldier. Those serving with Messines Company are led by a TA Major Conrad Giles whilst those attached to a regular regiment such as the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment take orders from a regular commanding officer. The TA frequently provides protection for regular soldiers who are not fighting on the frontline but who have to move around southern Iraq. In such situations the regular soldier must obey the TA unit's senior ranking soldier. </p> <p>In this instance it is Colour Sergeant Rob Denman, and he is calling out orders through the radio to the two guys in each of the vehicles whose heads are sticking out through a hole in the roof to provide covering fire. They are known as \"top cover\" and find themselves in one of the most exposed situations of all the military - a number of the recent deaths and injuries in Iraq amongst British troops were of soldiers doing top cover. </p> <p>Up top, one soldier faces the front and another the back, one with an SA80, one with a Minimi light machine gun, both looking for a possible threat. They cautiously keep their eyes open for snipers, mortar teams, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and the particularly lethal improvised explosive devices, IEDs, that can be left on the side of the road and detonated some distance away by remote control. If the convoy stops or slows for too long, they must dismount and try to move the trafficon while at the same time watching out for potential assaults. The rebels in the south have yet to use the suicide car bombs seen in Baghdad, but the soldiers are anxious that they soon could. </p> <p>\"Just so you are aware, there's one pax [person] standing up on that flatbed coming towards us,\" says Denman. \"As we move up the MSR [main supply route] make sure the vehicles are tight. I don't want no civvies in between us.\" The previous night, another Messines Company force protection team was the target of an RPG, which shot through the gap between two of their vehicles. They need to stay close. </p> <p>Nicknamed the Colourman because of his rank, Denman is 37 and works as a principal officer at Wandsworth prison. An hour and a half outside of Basra, he spots a cloud of black smoke up ahead. He tells the boys to approach slowly. They soon realise it's a traffic accident involving a Dutch military vehicle and a local car. </p> <p>Three Iraqis have died in the accident (the casualties were quickly removed by locals), but the Dutch soldiers have been standing by the side of the road for a while apparently doing nothing to police the situation. \"Maybe they are in shock,\" says Denman. He jumps down from his wagon and orders his soldiers to enact the drill they have trained for to deal with this situation. Denman starts to set up a vehicle checkpoint and control the traffic; the rest of the guys are sent to guard the peripheral area. An hour and a half later, the Dutch \"quick reaction force\" arrives and he can stand his men down. \"It's not very quick, the quick reaction force, is it?\" someone pipes up. \"Yesh, we have just come from Camp Shpliffy,\" cracks another. The Dutch, whose camp is called Smitty, are the butt of a lot of British jokes. </p> <p>Denman calls his boys \"the PlayStation generation\" because \"all they can use is their thumbs\", but really, he admits, \"I think they are the mutts' nuts because they bring all their outside experience to the job - and today they showed that the TA can do the same job as the regular army.\" </p> <p>In the team - as well as the prison officer, the nurse, and the City boy - are: Lance Corporal Ander Broadman, 30, who procures engineering works for Network Rail and missed out on a vital promotion by being in Iraq; private Ed Elliott, nicknamed Billy (as in Billy Elliott), who works for JP Morgan Fleming in the city and \"likes this sort of stuff, it's a break from delays on the Northern Line and fixing the photocopier\"; Private Tom Kelly, nicknamed Forceps because of the shape of his skull, who drives a HGV lorry for the Post Office; Dean \"Deano\" Moore, a shaven-headed joker of a joiner from Belfast; and Private Tim \"Watesy\" Wates, a recently-redundant recruitment consultant who joined the TA \"to shoot stuff. Not people, but to shoot off weapons, the feel, the sound, the power, there's a huge adrenalin rush: it's boys' toys\". </p> <p>Pace, who could have been a medic in the TA but preferred to join the infantry, says: \"It's like training for a football match and wanting to play. I didn't want to train and just use blanks in a forest somewhere. We do use live rounds when we are training sometimes in the UK but there's a different apprehension about it.\" Wates pipes in: \"That's what gives it the edge, you know there are people out there wanting to kill you.\" </p> <p> *** </p> <p>Britain has a long history of reserve forces, with Volunteer and Yeomanry units being formed during the Napoleonic wars. The TA was established in 1907. First known as the Territorial Force, it encouraged Britons to join in \"homeland defence\": the word territorial signified that those who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas. By 1921 it had changed its name to the Territorial Army. In the first world war, a number TA units volunteered to go to war and did not come back for four years, bringing back 71 Victoria Crosses for bravery. </p> <p>With the abolition of national service and the advent of the cold war, it seemed the TA's role was assured, but with the fall of the iron curtain, the security of the homeland was deemed to be under rather less of a threat. The Conservatives cut TA numbers by 15,000 between 1991 and 1994, then the present government scythed the numbers further from 54,000 to 41,000 as part of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. The then defence secretary George Robertson said: \"The TA should no longer be a force of last resort, held against a major conventional threat to the UK and Nato allies. More units will be placed at significantly higher states of readiness. And we will now be prepared to call them up - in formed units if needs be - in situations that fall short of a direct threat to the UK such as the Gulf war.\" This would, he added, give them a \"more heavyweight role\". The 40,000-strong TA now forms 25% of the British army, and can be called on to provide the army with entire formed units, or to supply individual specialists as required in IT, logistics, medicine, communications and other areas. </p> <p>Almost all of them, while essentially volunteers, have been compulsorily mobilised (the MoD calls it \"intelligent mobilisation\", insisting that it accommodates people who can prove it would be impossible for them to go for professional or personal reasons). The Reserve Forces Act 1996 obliges all employers to keep a TA soldier's job open but some have returned from Iraq to find this isn't the case. At least 17 are believed to be taking their former employers to tribunals after losing their jobs upon their return. </p> <p>Compared to the training undergone by regular soldiers, the territorials' induction can seem light. Soldiers attend training on three evenings each month, and commit themselves to one Sunday a month, and six weekends and two full weeks camp a year, which they must take out of their annual work leave. For these hours they are paid the same as a regular soldier of equivalent rank, ranging from \u00a329.10 a day for a private to \u00a3102.51 for a major. Each year they are awarded a tax-free bounty of between \u00a3350 and \u00a31,380 depending on length of service and on passing an annual battlefield weapons and fitness test. While they are mobilised, their salaries from their employers are suspended. The theory goes that a TA soldier on active service will be no worse off than he or she would be at home but sometimes this doesn't work out: a City trader can't expect to get his or her bonuses, but will get their mortgage and other \"reasonable\" outgoings covered. </p> <p>Inevitably, the \"Terries\" take a ribbing from both civilians and the regular army for \"playing\" at being soldiers, a dads' army of weekend warriors. The comedian Jack Dee recently described members of the TA as \"part-time soldier, full-time banging on about it\", while the best-known fictional TA member, Gareth from the Office, never lets his own service go forgotten: \"A lot of people think that the Territorial Army are not real soldiers. We are. We are well trained, highly disciplined fighting machines ready for war. We're just not available during the week.\" </p> <p>\"Until the TA changes their courses to six weeks like the regular army we will never be seen as the same as them,\" says one soldier from 52nd Lowland. \"But it takes them six weeks to do a course that takes us two weeks because they are not as brainy as us. That's why when regular guys leave the army the best job they can get is as a security adviser. But TA guys are different.\" In addition, the concept of rank can work rather differently with the territorials. Often, highly qualified civilians prefer to remain privates in what they see as a break from responsibility. Better educated, white-collar professionals often find themselves taking orders from someone who comes from a blue-collar background. </p> <p>Certainly there can be a marked difference in culture between regular and territorial units. Last year, I was embedded with a squadron of regular soldiers during the invasion of Iraq. Spending time with the TA in a similar situation, it seemed to me that the diversity and breadth of experience that these men and women had gained in their normal daily lives gave them more interesting things to talk about than their regular counterparts - and a rather different view of their involvement in the conflict. Most had signed up for the TA out of a sense of patriotism and duty, but they are far from army machines; as one, who had copies of The Spanish Civil War and The Rise and Fall of the British Empire by his bed, told me: \"I am a historian and I suppose I am in love with the romanticism of it all.\" Another did not believe the war was justified but enjoyed the adventure of it. </p> <p>Denman has been in the TA for 14 years - \"promoted and demoted a couple of times\" - and got his call-up papers for Iraq in January 2004. It was a blow to his wife Sandy and his two children, Amy, 11, and James, 7, but he has worked every other weekend as a prison officer so he is used to missing key family moments. He has gone on exercise to Estonia, Germany, Cyprus and Romania, but Iraq is his first proper tour of duty. With a few qualms, he says, he would be happy to come back for another. \"It's given me an outlet physically, getting out and not being surrounded by walls, a feeling of not being hemmed in. </p> <p>Like other soldiers, Denman has his own opinion about the war, but out here considers it irrelevant. \"I look at it the same way I do in the prison service: I am paid by society to carry out a task. I am paid to be a prison officer and to lawfully detain people and out here I am paid to be a soldier and follow the orders of my commanding officer and carry out foreign policy.\" </p> <p>His worst day in Iraq, he says, was when he went to the field hospital at Shaiba Logistics Base and saw a 22-year-old private from his company being fed through a straw. He had received a shrapnel wound in his throat when an IED exploded under his vehicle. \"Because I am a platoon sergeant I feel really, really responsible,\" says Denman. \"In a way you are a father figure; I feel responsible for my blokes. When you have been through all the training and the camaraderie and you see someone you don't want to see hurt hurt it makes you angry.\" </p> <p> *** </p> <p>This kind of attack has become more frequent in the British-controlled south since August, when Moqtada al-Sadr declared a holy war on British troops. It is now very rare to see British soldiers on the ground in their soft berets, a style of dress that was much trumpeted by the MoD in the days immediately after the war. The British claim they still have 90% of public consent, but it doesn't seem like that on the ground. </p> <p>The battle group further north in Amara, for instance, has been under the most sustained attack of any British unit since the Korean war, with 881 mortar rounds being fired at them since April. It is estimated that the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment has fired 30,000 rounds of ammunition, more than was used by all troops in the invasion phase last year. In August, the former family home of the governor of Maysan province used by the British as the headquarters of their civil and military cooperation unit (known as \"Cimic House\") came under siege; during one 10-day period, 428 mortars were fired at it. The 100 or so soldiers there - a high percentage of them TA - had to sit and battle it out. </p> <p>Hanging out in the humid, malodorous tent that is their home in Abu Naji camp, five miles outside Amara city centre, some of Colour Sergeant Irving's \"jocks\" (as the infantry privates in the 52 Lowland are known) recall the three-week battle of Cimic House. One soldier filmed the engagement: the camera tracks red tracer fire as it thrashes across the sky towards the building and then back out in returning fire. The subtitles count the 595 mortars, 10% of which landed within the perimeter: 57 RPG attacks, five 107mm rocket attacks and 86 small arms engagements. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't say it was horrific,\" says Fusilier Derek Currie. \"It was mad. A mortar knocked our sanger [an elevated guard post on the edge of camp] and deafened me for 8 hours.\" Currie is 21 and from Glasgow. In his normal life he works with children in after-school care: \"I do training, I do workshops with new employers, I organise sports days.\" Private David McCauley, 29, works in a call centre for the Manpower employment agency. \"It's not scary at the time but you sit down after and go, oh God, that was a bit hairy.\" </p> <p>But a boy with chipmunk teeth pipes up that it's \"brilliant\". Private Craig Hardie is 24 and a mechanic from Kelso, and he loves all this. He joined the TA 18 months ago, around the time of the fall of Saddam Hussein. Having trained in battlefield first aid he is the team medic, and the boys have stuck the label \"witch doctor\" above his campbed. This kind of engagement, he says, is \"what we join the TA for\". </p> <p>But however much it may seem to some like a great game, these boys, unlike many of the territorials in Iraq, have killed people. They know it should bother them, but at the time, when the killing was done, it just didn't. \"They shoot first: it's them or us,\" says McCauley. \"I would rather go home and see my two kids. If you slot someone, they are usually quite a distance away, so surprisingly, when you see them fall over, it doesn't really affect you that much since they were firing at us first.\" </p> <p>They say they are not worrying now about post-traumatic stress, or the many other psychological scars they may carry back to nine-to-five civilian lives. \"Most of us here will be OK because we talk to each other about it,\" says McCauley. \"I have been [nearby] when a mortar has hit a civilian's house and the first thing I have heard is a woman screaming, a sound you would never want to hear. I might not forget that.\" </p> <p>Later, a regular soldier tells me a story about being at Cimic House. \"I was on top of the Pink Palace with Keith [Irving] and we were crouched behind a really low parapet. I was shitting myself. I was on my belt buckle [lying down]. And Keith's up there with his rifle mounted over the parapet, bullets whizzing past him on either side and he's looking at me going: 'When your time's up you time's up.'\" He adds admiringly: \"And he's in the TA.\" Irving is not much of a stickler for ranks and titles. He and his sergeant Gordon Wylie, a plumber affectionately known as \"Wee Speccy\", believe that it is good for morale for the men to talk to each other like friends. </p> <p>That night, at 1am, a loud bang, followed by a dull thud, shudders the ground on the eastern perimeter. Ten 107mm rockets - \"a beast of a munition\", says Irving - have landed and detonated. They are met by outgoing rounds from a Warrior tank. Just another contact, but this time the assault is much more sustained and it comes as a shock to TA Corporal Lisa Lovell, who is in the Royal Military Police. Sitting up in bed, a worried look on her face, she tells me that this is the most scared she has felt on her tour. She is a solicitor from Newcastle and thinks this fear may be because her time here is coming to an end. The soldiers believe that this is statistically the time when something bad might happen to them because they are apt to let their guard down. </p> <p> *** </p> <p> Last month, the British moved out of Cimic House and handed it back to the Iraqis. Much of the work they were doing is now carried out from a cabin they call Cimic Hut that sits at the gates of Abu Naji; trips out of base are now very limited. On a table inside the hut sits a thick green file with the words \"Compensation Claims\" written on its spine. Sergeant William Cooper is looking at a photograph of a hole made in a wall by an RPG. A local woman, Jinan Salman Mohammed, hands over a photocopy of her identity card and a form which says, in English: \"My house was bombed during the events between Al-Sadr militias and British forces by shelling by British army.\" In a box she details the damage and how much she reckons it will cost to build again. \"Air conditioning, $400, bricks $250, sink and paint and glasses and basin with valves and mixer, $140, cement and sand, $300. Total: $1,340 US.\" </p> <p>Cooper says it seems a pretty fair assessment - \"sometimes, for damage to buildings they are trying for $10,000\" - but says it is not clear who is to blame. \"A lot of them bring these claims but they are not really sure who fired. We are trying to tell them that if we do fire any rockets or missiles it is all regulated and documented and we will know if it was us.\" In the past week they have had 30 claims for rocket damage. </p> <p>Sitting beside him, Lance Corporal Dougie Telford, a swimming pool lifeguard from Motherwell, is looking at a set of photographs showing damage to a car and getting angry. \"I saw this photograph yesterday with another claimant. Fuck off. I want other pictures, I want a court report.\" The young man's claim for damages astounds him. \"An air conditioning unit for $6,372. You can build a house for $2,500 and you are trying to claim $6,372.\" The boy laughs when he hears the interpreter's translation. They add the claim to the pile. </p> <p>Later, Telford holds up an x-ray and says: \"This is a compensation claim. The person says they have been hit by shrapnel.\" In the middle of the negative is a distinctive foreign body lodged in the gut. \"Look, it's a bloody safety pin.\" </p> <p>Today, a frustrated crowd of 350 men have been hanging around since dawn. This assembly has been going on for a few days now, since the rumour spread that they were hiring people at the camp and recruiting for the new Iraqi police force. It's not true, but still the desperate turn up; an enterprising man hunkers down on his knees beside the crate of cola he has hauled for miles to sell to them. Lack of jobs is probably the most serious issue in Amara. \"The pot is starting to boil again and it is all about unemployment,\" predicts one intelligence officer. </p> <p>Several soldiers tell me they are enjoying their time in Iraq, but many members of the TA detest their assignments. One senior regular officer admits that the TA very often get the less exciting jobs, particularly the monotonous guard duty, day in day out. This is because his men - the \"real soldiers\" he slips, before quickly correcting himself with \"regular soldiers\" - are career soldiers who have to think about promotion and the jobs they have to do in order to secure it. </p> <p>Nor are the conditions in which they are serving in any way hospitable. Abu Naji is the worst of the British camps in terms of living conditions: there isn't much to do here apart from be a soldier. There are no TV lounges or bars like the other camps, and no air conditioning in the junior ranks' cookhouse. In the height of summer the fetid 60 degree air is thick with flies. </p> <p>Corporal Malcolm \"Beachy\" Grieve is a 43-year-old slaughterman whose daily life involves cutting through animal carcasses in an abattoir in Selkirk in the Scottish Borders. He was mobilised in February and is extremely unhappy in Abu Naji. He joined the TA 14 years ago, he says, \"to be part of a team and get the extra coin, it was good money at the time\"- and until Iraq he loved it. This is his first deployment and, apart from the TA annual two-week camp, the first time he has been away from his family. His wife Theresa was \"very upset and didn't want me to gang [go]\". A small man with a large paunch and decorously tattooed arms, he has been assigned to stores and so instead of soldiering he is gofering: \"I go for coffee, I go for salmon, I go for corned beef.\" </p> <p>Sitting in the Portakabin-type accommodation that he shares with Telford and Cooper, he says he was originally brought out as a driver of what are called \"white fleet\" vehicles, unarmed 4X4s. But the situation in the Amara area has since escalated, and the white fleet never go out any more. Hence the gofering. </p> <p>\"For the first three months we were battered from pillar to post - guards, convoys, whatever they could fit us into - which was a bit of a disappointment because I would rather have gone back to my own company. Really, I thought they had nothing for us to do. If anybody said to me, 'What do you think of the tour?' I would say it's been the biggest waste of nine months of my life, because I have never done anything constructive to help the Iraqis.\" </p> <p>Beachy's other big complaint, aside from boredom, is money. He is missing out on his bonuses and funds at home are tight. \"Naturally, working in a slaughterhouse, there's no need for the wife to buy butcher meat and that. With four bairns that's quite a lot of money. Every job has got its perks but the army doesn't appreciate that.\" He asked to get back home in October so that he could be back at work in time to earn some money for Christmas. TA soldiers are allowed 40 days leave upon their return but many, like Beachy, can't afford to take it. </p> <p>Then there's what he sees as the lack of support for his wife. \"I'm lucky because I have a big family around about my wife but there has been no information or support for her. I think the army should help them, the wives have not got a clue. What does the wife do if she's got depression or that?\" </p>",
  "Booker prize winning author Bernice Rubens, who once said \"I feel unclean if I don't write every day\", has died in hospital in London, weeks after a memoir. <p>\"She was writing, writing, writing right up to the final weeks of her life,\" her agent, Charles Walker, said yesterday. \"The memoir is more or less finished.\" </p> <p>She had been in hospital since suffering a stroke a fort night ago. At the age of 76 her work rate was unrelenting. She published two novels in the last three years, the most recent, The Sergeant's Tale, a startlingly topical book linking the British mandate in postwar Palestine with the problems of contemporary Israel. </p> <p>She also worked as a documentary film maker, and two of her own books were filmed, most memorably Madame Sousatzka in 1962, directed by John Schlesinger and starring Shirley MacLaine. </p> <p>She was brought up in an Orthodox Jewish community in Cardiff, where her father had arrived as a Russian refugee, and where she was born in 1928. </p> <p>Many readers came to her work through the literary festival circuit, on which she was a virtuoso reader of her own and other authors' work. Her own work was relished for its wry humour, sly observation of character and cracking plots, as much as its political themes and examination of the Jewish identity. </p> <p>Last year when the Guardian nominated 101 worthy women left out of Prospect Magazine's top 100 public intellectuals, we in turn left out Bernice Rubens. Readers' protests poured in and she was hastily added to a revised list. </p> <p>She won the Booker in its second year, 1970 - from an exceptional short list including books by Iris Murdoch and William Trevor - for The Elected Member, a study of mental illness and the theories of RD Laing.</p>",
  "The Israeli army yesterday suspended an officer who is accused of firing up to 20 bullets into a 13-year-old Palestinian as she lay on the ground after having been shot from an army outpost. <p>Another schoolgirl died yesterday after being shot while sitting at her school desk. </p> <p>The deaths were in the southern Gaza Strip, some miles away from an ongoing army operation which have seen more than 100 Palestinians killed, including many civilians. </p> <p>The Israeli army suspended the platoon commander when several soldiers threatened to refuse to serve under him if he was not removed. The soldiers told Israeli media that the officer ignored warnings that a person approaching an army outpost last week was a schoolgirl. </p> <p>After she was shot, he approached Imam al Hamas, 13, as she lay on the ground and fired two bullets at her body before emptying the contents of his rifle magazine into her, the soldiers said. </p> <p>Colonel Eyal Eisenberg, an army commander in Gaza, told Israel Army Radio that he had suspended the platoon commander pending an investigation. Col Eisenberg said this would be conducted quickly and that there would be no whitewash. </p> <p>The second schoolgirl, Ghadeer Mokheimer, 10, died of injuries sustained on Tuesday at her UN-run school in Khan Yunis. </p> <p>It was the second time in recent weeks that a schoolgirl had been killed at her desk by Israeli gunfire, said Peter Hansen, head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA. </p> <p>\"That two young children have been shot and killed, sitting at their desks in UNRWA schools in the last month is horrific ... schools should be havens of peace,\" he said. </p> <p>The Israeli army said the incident followed the firing of homemade mortars at a Jewish settlement. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Gaza, the army continued its operation to stop the firing of Qassam rockets into Israel. Militants fired two which fell near the town of Sderot without causing any damage. </p> <p>Tanks moved deeper into the town of Beit Lahiya and three militants were killed and seven Palestinians were wounded in the fighting, including four children between the ages of 5 and 16. </p> <p>Early this morning, a Hamas militant was killed in an Israeli missile strike in the Jabaliya refugee camp. Israel also said it had arrested a West Bank leader, Imad al-Kawasme, that it suspects of masterminding suicide bombings in Beerscheba in August that killed 16. </p>",
  "<p>There are footballers who respond to a foul night in the way that other men bask in the sun. As the winter wind scoured the pitch and the mercury cowered in the thermometer, it was victory as usual for England but not in the customary manner. Sven-Goran Eriksson's team, protecting Michael Owen's goal, could only be as neat as unpredictable conditions and frozen feet permitted. </p> <p>This, particularly in a second half where Azerbaijan pushed gamely downfield, put the emphasis on men who would detest football if it ever became a summer sport. Nicky Butt, for instance, was instrumental in ensuring that Carlos Alberto's side scarcely had a chance in the game. Azeri moves cracked like thin ice. </p> <p>With a second win on foreign soil to follow the defeat of Poland, England have developed their control of Group Six by moving on to 10 points. In addition to having talents denied to the other contenders, Eriksson has a broader squad. They could play in a variety of ways and were well equipped to tough it out in Baku. </p> <p>If the margin was slender, this was a much firmer display than those given when, say, England scrambled to 2-1 wins over Slovakia and Macedonia en route to Euro 2004. Jermaine Jenas fitted in as if he had been designed for the responsibilities on the right of the minimalist three-man midfield. </p> <p>This, however, was not only his first start with England but also his debut in international competition. For 71 minutes, he showed athleticism and was prudent on the ball. It seems likely that Jenas found it easier to embrace a downbeat night such as this than the suspended David Beckham would have done. </p> <p>With Frank Lampard as intent as ever on imposing himself, Eriksson's trust in a reduced midfield was vindicated even though Azerbaijan had believed they could put a numerical advantage in that area to good use. If the Swede felt a twinge of disappointment it will have arisen from the shortage of chances despite the abundance of forwards. </p> <p>The Tofik Bakhramov Stadium may well get a plaque as the place where the normally brazen Wayne Rooney first appeared subdued. There would be no difficulty in picking out an incident here or there that highlighted his technique, but there was hardly any exuberance. </p> <p>Just before the interval, a pass back to the goalkeeper saw Azerbaijan concede a free-kick to the left of the goalmouth. On this occasion Rooney could do no more than slam it into a pack of players. When he did hit a 30-yard shot from another set piece, with nine minutes remaining, Jahangir Hasanzade dived to push it away comfortably. </p> <p>These were not failings by Rooney, merely instances of ordinary experience in an already spectacular career. It will be healthy for the Manchester United signing to encounter them and useful, too, for England to realise that they will not always be treated as Rooney's retinue. </p> <p>Owen, of course, can claim the evening as his own. It is premature to declare that he has come back to his best, but his worth was not to be questioned here or against Wales last Saturday. That should be considered a starting point for a man who now goes back to prove himself in Madrid. </p> <p>In the 22nd minute, England moved the ball well from Gary Neville on the right to his fellow full-back Ashley Cole on the other flank. The cross was deep and put Owen at an advantage as he rose to meet it with a header which found the net after clipping the body of Hasanzade. </p> <p>Earlier the goalkeeper had leapt to his right to push wide an attempt by Lampard which had deflected off Owen. It was like a parody of the incident that ended, after long and sober consideration, with the Chelsea midfielder being credited with the opening goal against Wales. </p> <p>Owen, though, was to give everyone something else to focus on. With Rooney staying fairly deep and Jermain Defoe, after a sprightly start, dropping from sight, there was a reminder that the Real Madrid man is England's senior striker. He now has 28 goals from 65 international appearances. </p> <p>Azerbaijan, by contrast, posed little threat at all even if Anatoly Ponomaryov had an appealingly old-fashioned 70s aspect as a long-haired mid fielder who likes to go on rangy runs. He did not get far enough with them, usually checked before he could slice open the back four. </p> <p>Rio Ferdinand attended well to any stirrings by the mediocre forwards and Paul Robinson had only one significant contribution to make. The goalkeeper was decisive, blocking with his feet, when Samir Aliyev challenged for a loose ball at a 51st-minute free-kick. </p> <p>England took a second consecutive clean sheet, doing so with little difficulty, even if Sol Campbell was far from his best. He has served Eriksson so well that the sort of lapse here that led to a booking for Nicky Butt will not be held against him. </p> <p>All the same, Campbell himself realises that, with John Terry and Ledley King around, he will have to be at his best to retain his status in the years ahead. If that makes him pensive, Eriksson can reflect contentedly that England may be bound for a higher level in world football.</p>"
