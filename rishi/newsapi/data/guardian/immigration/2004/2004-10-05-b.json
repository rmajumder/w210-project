  "<p><strong>Eastern Encounters</strong></p> <p> 7.30pm, Five</p> <p>Once Vasco da Gama landed in Goa at the end of the 15th century, there was little to stop other Europeans from exploring the riches to be found in various parts of Asia. These soon manifested themselves in the works of art that make up the Victoria and Albert Museum's new exhibition, The Meeting of Asia and Europe. This preview of the exhibition shows the enduring legacy of the fabrics and materials used to make some exquisite creations. </p> <p><strong>Horizon</strong></p> <p>9pm, BBC2</p> <p>It's always fascinating to see the scientific community get its knickers in a twist when someone comes along to turn over a dearly held theory. This time it's Professor Gerta Keller who is making herself unpopular by questioning the long-held view that dinosaurs were wiped out by the impact of an asteroid 65 million years ago. Not quite, she says, pointing to some rock formations in Mexico that show that the impact theory isn't as cut and dried as once thought. But then two other scientists have worked out another theory, just to thicken the plot somewhat. </p> <p><strong>The Great British Asian Invasion</strong></p> <p> 9pm, Channel 4</p> <p>Many people in Britain tend to lump all Asians into one homogeneous group, not knowing or caring about the differing cultures and continents that make up Britain's largest immigrant minority. As this entertaining and engrossing documentary shows, we've got the doctors from India who were invited to shore up the faltering NHS in the 1960s (organised by Enoch Powell, no less). Then there are the Bangladeshis who transformed British cuisine with their countless \"Indian\" restaurants, and the East African Asians who were suddenly turfed out of Uganda and came to Britain to resume their centuries-old tradition of trade and transformed business practices. And then there are Pakistanis who took up offers of back-breaking, exploitative work in northern factories to keep British industry going.</p>",
  "Islam Dwidar's classmates were still taking in her shocking death - the teacher weeping outside before facing the girls, her closest friend recounting how they walked to school together each day - when the news arrived about Tahreer Abu El Jidyan. <p>The two 15-year-old pupils at Jabaliya's school were both shot in the head by Israeli soldiers inside their homes just a few blocks and several hours apart. Islam died almost immediately after the bullet smashed through her forehead as she baked bread with her mother in their yard on Sunday. Tahreer is still on life support at a Gaza hospital after an operation to remove shards of shattered skull from her brain. </p> <p>She lies motionless, with little to suggest she is alive other than gentle breathing. Doctors do not expect her to survive. </p> <p>Tahreer's mother, Intisar, was at her bedside yesterday. </p> <p>\"Oh Tahreer, my heart. I wish I were lying in this bed, not you,\" she whispered to her child. \"She was sweeping the floor in front of the door,\" said Mrs Abu El Jidyan. \"I was standing talking to her. We knew the Israeli soldiers were around, we knew they had snipers in the buildings on our street but we didn't expect what happened. They just shot her in the head. Her brains spilled out. She said: 'Mum, I'm hit'. She praised God and she collapsed.\" </p> <p>There were two bullets. The first struck Tahreer in the head. As she fell, the second hit the wall behind her. \"I've no doubt a sniper shot her deliberately. There was no fighting in the area. There were no other shots, only the ones that hit Tahreer,\" said her mother. </p> <p>With her stood Tahreer's 14-year-old brother, Naser, who was wounded by shrapnel last week. Israeli forces killed their father 11 years ago during the first intifada. </p> <p>Mrs Abu El Jidyan regrets preventing Tahreer from walking to school on Sunday morning. She thought it would be too dangerous to venture out of their home in Jabaliya's Sikka neighbourhood because it is on the edge of the area occupied by Israeli troops and tanks last week. Snipers are posted in buildings overlooking their street and a tank is less than a block away. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't let her out of the house but it was dangerous at home too. When there was fighting, bullets came through the walls. We stopped using some rooms on the side where the Israelis are,\" she said. </p> <p>Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups say that about half of the nearly 80 people killed by the army over the past week of \"Operation Days of Penitence\" are civilians. The military says it has carefully targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters with missile strikes. </p> <p>But while the numbers are in dispute - in part because it is often hard to say whether youths in their mid to late teens are bystanders or part of the Palestinian resistance - there is no doubt that a growing number of children have been felled by Israeli snipers. </p> <p>At Islam and Tahreer's school in Jabaliya yesterday morning, the headmistress, Rukaya Kamal al Budani, fielded calls from parents wanting to know if it was safe to send their girls. \"If they can get here, it's safe,\" was her stock reply. But of 1,150 pupils, fewer than 200 turned up. </p> <p>Before word reached the school about Tahreer, Mrs al Budani was getting to grips with the death of Islam. </p> <p>\"This is our first casualty at the school,\" she said. \"I don't know how to deal with the girls. It's going to have a big impact on her classmates and friends. I'm shocked that no one in the free world condemns the killing of a child.\" </p> <p>Then one of the male teachers tells Mrs al Budani about the shooting of Tahreer the previous day. The headmistress sits in silence. </p> <p>Until June, the two young women had been classmates, but then Tahreer failed her exams and was held back for a year. Asmaa Abu Samaan walked to school with her each morning. </p> <p>\"I met her in front of my house each morning to walk to school. I did my homework with her. I keep thinking that if she is brain-dead and not killed perhaps she is still suffering. I can't stand it,\" she said. </p> <p>Asmaa walked to school yesterday morning without her friend.\"I walked against the wall hoping the soldiers can't see me. I want to go to school because I know the Jews do not want us to study because we need to be educated to build our country,\" she said. </p> <p>But the killing went on as the conflict claimed the life of another teenage girl in the Gaza strip yesterday. Palestinian medics said Israeli soldiers fired about 20 bullets into 13- year-old Iman al-Hams, including five into her head. </p> <p>The military said she had entered a forbidden zone in Rafah refugee camp, and that she dropped a bag that soldiers feared was a bomb. </p> <p>The Palestinians said Iman was walking to school when troops entered the camp and that she dropped her bag as she ran away in fear. </p> <p>The bag was not found to contain a bomb.</p>",

  "The hour-long drive up route 93 from Boston to Derry in New Hampshire (population 34,021) is punctuated by banners calling on people to \"support the troops\" and others saying \"bring the troops home\". It is also framed by a New England fall. <p>The leaves, ripe with autumn and fluttering in Hurricane Jeanne's tail, blend chocolate, lime, ruby and gold. </p> <p>Take your eyes off the road for a moment and you will catch a glorious blur; fix them back on the licence plate in front of you and New Hampshire's libertarian principles are etched in black and white: \"Live Free or Die\". </p> <p>The state certainly takes these principles seriously. </p> <p>It has no income tax or sales tax. On the ground floor of the local library they mark Banned Book week by putting the works of authors who have been proscribed elsewhere in the country, such as Isabel Allende, Alice Walker, Judy Blume and JK Rowling, on a special shelf with the note: \"Someone, well intentioned or not, wanted to 'protect' other readers by preventing them having the choice to see these books. The Derry Public Library invites you to decide for yourself what your children should read.\" </p> <p>But for a place so suspicious of government, New Hampshire has an awful lot of it. Although it is one of the 10 least populous states in the nation, it has by far the largest legislature - 424 representatives for just 1.28 million inhabitants. </p> <p>\"We expect there to be a close distance between voter and candidate,\" says the historian Richard Holmes. \"When we vote locally it's not for parties but because, 'I know this man to be a good man'.\" </p> <p>And, as the first state to hold primaries, there is an intimacy between voters here and the presidential candidates. Lisa O'Neill had Howard Dean speak in her front garden. Jack Polidoro of Laconia twice had dinner with the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards. </p> <p>The Republican state senator, Frank Sapareto, has met George Bush several times. Sit in Mul's Diner on Derry's Broadway long enough in an election year and there's a good chance you'll bump into the next president. Last week alone Mr Bush, his mother and daughters were here, as were Mr Kerry and Mr Edwards. </p> <p>It may be small but New Hampshire is sufficiently awkward and unpredictable - in the 1992 primaries it resurrected Bill Clinton's fortunes and in 2000 almost derailed Mr Bush by backing John McCain - for it not to be ignored. </p> <p>This year is no different. The state should be a Republican stronghold, but it isn't. In 2000 Mr Bush took it narrowly by 48% to Al Gore's 47%, with Ralph Nader getting 4%. This time round the latest polls have Mr Bush and Mr Kerry even on 46% and Mr Nader on 2%. </p> <p>It is a sign of how close the election is nationally that both parties are working so hard here, even though the state has only four votes in the electoral college that chooses the president. Candidates need 270 college votes to win, but New Hampshire would have been enough to tip the result for Mr Gore four years ago. </p> <p>Many factors could explain the current unease with Mr Bush's administration. </p> <p>\"We left the Republican party because it's been taken over by the religious right,\" says Nan Stearns, who voted for Mr Bush in 2000 but will be backing Mr Kerry in November. \"All my life I voted Republican. But George Bush doesn't represent to us what America means to us.\" </p> <p>Mr Nader, who has been distracted by attempts to get on the ballot, has had little time to campaign here. That has left plenty of room on the left for the Democratic challenger for the senate, Doris Haddock, a 94-year-old great-grandmother of 16 who is known as Granny D. </p> <p>\"The corporations have taken over,\" she says after a packed house party in Laconia. \"To become a powerful man today you have to sell your soul.\" </p> <p>But a worry for both parties, says Andrew Smith, the director of the University of New Hampshire survey centre, is that their national messages have proved too simplistic here. There are few blue-collar workers and minorities who would usually back the Democrats, and relatively few fundamentalist churchgoers on whom the Republicans rely. </p> <p>\"New Hampshire is a Republican state but not a conservative state,\" he says. \"Both the Democratic and Republican bases here are out of step with their bases in the rest of the country.\" </p> <p>The themes that work for each party nationally do not work so well in New Hampshire. James Pindell, the managing editor of <a href=\"http://www.Politicsnh.com\">Politicsnh.com</a>, the state's online newsletter, says: \"Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can play their trump cards.\" </p> <p>In the bowels of the local museum there is a picture marking a moment that would change Derry forever, and helps explain why the politics of the town have become so difficult to read. Alan Shepard, America's first man in space and a native son, is kneeling in a hard hat next to a detonator as his wife, Louise, looks on. </p> <p>It was 1962 and the town's population was in decline along with the shoe manufacturer that was one of the area's major employers. Shepard was presiding over the ceremonial explosion that would blast interstate 93 into existence. From then on Derry would be starved of its identity as a town in its own right and start feeding Boston. </p> <p>After this the growth was exponential, Mr Holmes says. \"It was a good place to grow a family and people came here looking for green. Within a decade its population had doubled. Within two it had tripled; within three it had quadrupled.\" </p> <p>By the late 60s Derry had its first mall and was well on the way to suburbanisation. A fifth of the town's current residents did not even live in New Hampshire 10 years ago, and 70% were born outside the state. The huge influx over a relatively short period of time unsettled an already fragile political equilibrium. </p> <p>\"The question is, who are these people?\" asks Mr Pindell. \"All the indicators are that they are the most likely people to vote but nobody knows how. Seventy per cent of them came from Massachusetts. Did they come here because they were ostracised by the taxes or are they socially liberal people bringing their values with them?\" </p> <p>It matters. In 2000 Rockingham county, where Derry is, voted 49% Republican, 46% Democrat, 4% Nader. Since then the population has grown by 5%. </p> <p>Canvassers from America Coming Together, a progressive pressure group, visited a newly built neighbourhood to find out more about the recent arrivals. They came across a range of opinions, from a man who thought opposing the government in wartime was treasonous to those concerned about illegal immigration. </p> <p>But Yvonne Shostack spoke for most when she said her main concern was the war. \"I thought things would be more resolved than they are,\" she said. \"People are still getting killed and we're still out there ... I'm on the fence. I don't know if Kerry will help the situation, but I don't think Bush can.\"</p>",
  "America's former proconsul in Baghdad delivered a damning critique of the Bush administration's policy on Iraq yesterday, saying the US had made two grave errors of judgment in the early days of the war. <p>Paul Bremer, who was America's most senior official in Baghdad until the handover last June, said the US committed two major blunders which compromised the course of events in Iraq: it went to war without enough troops and it did not contain the looting and violence after Saddam Hussein's regime fell. </p> <p>\"We paid a big price for not stopping it because it established an atmosphere of lawlessness,\" Mr Bremer told a conference of insurance agents in West Virginia. \"We never had enough troops on the ground.\" </p> <p>Mr Bremer is the latest in a stream of US government officials to voice doubts on the administration's strategy on Iraq, but such criticism is surprising from a man who says he \"strongly supports\" the re-election of President George Bush . </p> <p>The comments, surfacing only hours ahead of last night's vice-presidential debate between John Edwards and Dick Cheney, were very badly timed for the administration - and a boon for the Democrats. </p> <p>Mr Cheney is widely regarded as the architect of the war and came under renewed pressure to account for what the Democratic challenger, John Kerry, yesterday called a \"long list of mistakes\" on Iraq. \"I hope Mr Cheney can take responsibility,\" Mr Kerry said. </p> <p>Mr Bremer's comments are also a belated rebuke to the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, who overruled his army chief of staff and other military officials by opting for a smaller invasion force, and who famously dismissed reports of looting in April 2003 by saying \"Stuff happens\" and \"Freedom is untidy\". </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld attempted yesterday to undo the damage from statements made hours earlier, in which he acknowledged there was no connection between al-Qaida and Saddam. \"To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that links the two,\" Mr Rumsfeld told the Council on Foreign Relations . </p> <p>The statement - a u-turn on Mr Rumsfeld's assertion in September 2002 that the CIA had \"bulletproof\" evidence of a connection - appeared in line with a new intelligence review that failed to find a connection. </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld later said his comments to the council had been \"misunderstood\". </p> <p>More attention was devoted to the comments from Mr Bremer, who shared Mr Cheney's and Mr Rumsfeld's views on Iraq, and who maintained yesterday that America was right to go to war. </p> <p>The White House yesterday refused to say whether Mr Bremer had asked for more troops during his frequent visits to Washington. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Bremer released a statement claiming that his remarks were intended for a private audience, and that the US now had sufficient troops on the ground. </p> <p>He also reaffirmed that the war in Iraq is an \"integral part of fighting this war on terror\". </p> <p>However, Mr Bremer began expressing doubts about the administration's strategy before his speech to the insurance conference. During a September 17 appearance at Indiana's DePauw University he accused the administration of disregarding his advice to bring in more troops. </p> <p>\"The single most important change - the one thing that would have improved the situation - would have been having more troops in Iraq at the beginning and throughout [the occupation],\" Mr Bremer was reported to have said. </p> <p>The debate on America's preparations for war on Iraq was opened in early 2003 when the then army chief of staff, General Eric Shinseki, said the invasion needed an occupying force of several hundred thousand soldiers - much to the fury of Mr Rumsfeld whose battle plans called for a streamlined force. </p> <p>In January, the chief weapons inspector, David Kay, testified that western intelligence agencies \"were all wrong\" in their assessment that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>Last month, a former CIA official Paul Pillar told a private dinner that the White House disregarded intelligence reports two months before the invasion warning that a war could unleash a violent insurgency. </p> <p>Mr Bremer claimed that US planners had failed to anticipate the chaos that would follow Saddam's departure, saying that planners were more concerned with preventing a refugee exodus and a humanitarian crisis that did not arise. \"There was planning, but planning for a situation that didn't arise,\" he said.</p>",
  "Police in France yesterday found more arms caches and a secret shooting range belonging to Eta, while Spanish politicians claimed that a vast, ongoing operation against the armed separatists would hasten the end of the Basque terrorist group. <p>The arrests on Sunday of Eta leader Mikel Albizu and the group's most senior woman, Soledad Iparraguirre, at a farmhouse in south-west France was the start of an operation that would last months, the Spanish interior minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alonso, said yesterday. </p> <p>Seven safe-houses and at least four arms caches still have to be searched for clues by French anti-terrorist police - a job that, on its own, is expected to take more than a week. </p> <p>Yesterday a new arms cache, stocked with detonators and explosives, was found in the garden of one of the safe-houses, according to Spanish press reports. One of the houses searched on Sunday, at Saint Pierre de Irube, turned out to have an underground shooting range used for practising with small arms. </p> <p>With 16 other people still being held by police yesterday and large quantities of sub-machine guns, grenade launchers and explosives already discovered, experts said the operation would leave Eta weaker than at any time in the past 30 years. </p> <p>\"Eta is now further weakened and in very bad shape,\" the interior minister told Spanish state television, before warning that the group was not yet defeated. </p> <p>Police were hoping to find details of the group's membership and funding, as well as more arms and explosives. </p> <p>Mr Albizu and Ms Iparraguirre had spent four years living in a French farmhouse near the village of Salis-de-B\u00e9arn. They rented the house from a farmer, a village councillor who lived in a smaller house on the same estate. He has also been arrested. </p> <p>The couple had a daughter who attended the local primary school. Local people were shocked at hearing of their high-level involvement in Eta. \"It can't be true. They had a child,\" one neighbour told Spain's El Mundo newspaper yesterday. </p> <p>The farmhouse was an hour's drive from the Spanish border and the Basque region where the group traditionally carries out most of its attacks. </p> <p>Experts yesterday speculated that leadership would pass into the hands of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Urrutikoetxea, alias Josu Ternera, a veteran of the group who served a prison sentence before becoming a regional deputy for the separatist Batasuna party in the Basque parliament. </p> <p>Mr Ternera disappeared two years ago after the party, which obtained up to 10% of the vote in Spain's semi-autonomous Basque region, was declared illegal. He is reported to have returned to Eta, but police believe that the 54-year-old may be seriously ill. </p> <p>\"The signs point to Ternera,\" said Rogelio Alonso, a terrorism expert at Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid. \"The latest operation is part of a trend. We have seen very important arrests over the last year and the rhythm at which they are happening is extraordinary. Eta is so penned in that it will now find things very difficult.\" </p> <p>Eta is known to have considered increasing the randomness of its violence in recent years, but is aware that it is losing its support among hardline separatists. It has not killed for 16 months, making this the group's quietest period - barring temporary ceasefires - since 1972. </p> <p>Spanish politicians have been claiming for several years that they have Eta on the run, with the previous conservative government pointing to the arrests of nearly 200 suspected members over recent years. </p> <p>\"There is only one thing we can say to Eta: that its destiny is for there to be an end to violence,\" the Spanish prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, said yesterday. </p> <p>But the interior minister warned that the weapons and explosives seized in Sunday's raids showed Eta was still capable of attacking. </p> <p>No official figures for the amount of explosives and ammunition captured have yet been provided but Spain's leading newspaper, El Pa\u00eds, said it included 400kg (880lb) of dynamite and 40,000 rounds of ammunition. </p> <p>\"Clearly, the material that was seized - the weapons as well as the explosives and the detonators, etc - show that the gang had a major arsenal,\" the interior minister said.</p>",
  "Israel is insisting that Operation Days of Penitence, its latest incursion into the Gaza Strip, is needed to protect its territory from the Palestinian rockets which killed two toddlers in the southern town of Sderot last week. But the scale of the offensive, the largest since the reoccupation of much of the West Bank in 2002, poses disturbing questions about the intentions of Ariel Sharon's government. According to independent reports, some 68 Palestinians, fighters and civilians, have been killed in six days of fighting, many around the sprawling Jabaliya refugee camp, where the first intifada erupted 17 years ago. Palestinian sources said one of yesterday's victims was a four-year-old child. Two Israeli soldiers and civilians have died. The unequal casualties reflect the unequal strength of the two sides, one armed with sophisticated Apache helicopters, drone-firing missiles and armoured bulldozers, and the other with rudimentary Qassam rockets and small arms, and of course, when they get through Israel's controversial \"security fence\", suicide bombers. <p>This is a war, and a brutal and senseless one. The UN refugee agency, Unrwa, has rejected accusations by Israel that its ambulances have been used to transport rockets when the \"suspicious\" objects were in fact stretchers. And there is evidence that Gaza's already rickety infrastructure is being deliberately targeted, with thousands of Palestinians trapped for days without access to hospitals, power or water after electricity generators and sewage pipes were destroyed by the army. Gaza was a bleak and hopeless place long before the Israelis conquered it it in their lightning military victory in 1967. But 37 long and and bloody years later, things have never been so bad. Prolonged border closures mean that only a few thousand Palestinians are now able to work across the old \"green line\" border in Israel proper. Unemployment is a staggering 60%, while the PLO the younger General Sharon tried in vain to wipe out in the early 1970s has been supplanted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. </p> <p>The Israelis, who are now finally on their way out, should understand that it is not in their interest to make Gaza even more of a basket case than it already is. Mr Sharon's commitment to a unilateral withdrawal has been welcomed by default since the internationally backed \"road map\" to peace is barely alive. Any return of occupied territory, and the dismantling of settlements which should never have been there, are good things - even if the Likud leader is acting to consolidate Israel's permanent hold on the West Bank with the the irresponsible support of the Bush administration. </p> <p>Mr Sharon, who faces strong domestic opposition, is clearly determined to avoid the impression that he is being driven out of of Gaza under fire. But Hamas is playing politics and propaganda too by launching its rocket attacks - from within densely populated civilian areas - that it must know will attract massive retaliation by the Israelis. </p> <p>Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian president, isolated in his Ramallah HQ - and unwilling or unable to rein in the militants who disdain his crumbling authority - was displaying a familiar reflex action when he called on the international community to stop \"inhumane and racist crimes\" - a call heeded when the UN security council met to debate the escalating crisis. But his prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, struck a different note when he urged Hamas \"to think about the higher national interest and not give Israel excuses to continue the aggression against our people in Gaza\". Israel's offensive is likely only to deepen hatred and fuel Palestinian resistance. But a world that is weary of this endless conflict, and distracted by disaster in Iraq, should do more than wring its hands. Both sides must be warned that they have no alternative but to negotiate with each other.</p>",

  "An Israeli missile strike killed a leader of Islamic Jihad and another member of the militant group today, a week into an Israeli military offensive aimed at ending Palestinian rocket fire on Israeli towns. <p>In Gaza City, an Israeli aircraft fired two missiles toward a car, killing a top official of Islamic Jihad, Bashir Aldabash, 40, and another member of the group, Zarees Alareer. </p> <p>The first missile missed, but the second hit the vehicle, which burst into flames. The burning vehicle drove for about 100 meters (yards) before it came to a stop. The army said Aldabash was \"responsible for dozens of terrorist attacks.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Washington, the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, said he hoped the Israeli campaign in northern Gaza - the deadliest in the strip in four years of Israeli-Palestinian fighting - would end soon. </p> <p>\"The immediate problem right now is that Israeli built-up areas are being hit by rockets and (Israeli Prime Minister Ariel) Sharon finds a need to respond to that. I hope it does not expand,\" Mr Powell said. \"And I hope that whatever he does is proportionate to the threat that Israel is facing and I hope that this operation can come to a conclusion quickly.\" </p> <p>Nearly half the 70 Palestinians killed and 60% of the more than 400 wounded in the campaign were civilians, Palestinian hospital officials said. Israeli troops have also demolished dozens of houses to carve out paths for tanks, mainly in the Jebaliya refugee camp, scene of the heaviest fighting. </p> <p>An Israeli military official said Palestinian security officials have delivered messages through mediators, offering to try to prevent rocket fire on Israeli towns if Israel ends the operation. However, Israel appears to be in no rush to pull back. </p> <p>A senior Palestinian official said he was unaware of contacts with Israel, which refuses to negotiate directly with the Palestinian Authority. </p> <p>Israeli security officials have said targeted killings of Palestinian militants were also part of the offensive, \"Days of Penitence,\" which was launched last week, after two Israeli children, ages 2 and 4, were killed by Palestinian rocket fire on a border town. </p> <p>In New York, Palestinians pushed for quick adoption of a UN security council resolution demanding an end to the Israeli offensive. Arab nations that introduced the resolution said they want a vote today. </p> <p>But the US ambassador to the United Nations, John Danforth, said another resolution is not the answer, and that the council \"acts as the adversary of the Israelis and cheerleader to the Palestinians.\"</p>",
  "The return of Eurosceptic millionaire Paul Sykes to the Tory fold has brought relief to the party, which fears being squeezed by the UK Independence party at the general election, but also unease about a possible move to the right. <p>The Yorkshire businessman, who contributed over half of Ukip's \u00a32m fighting fund for June's European elections, said that the party had \"blown it\" by deciding to field candidates against Eurosceptic Tory MPs.</p> <p>Mr Sykes' announcement was followed by a resolutely Eurosceptic speech by the Tory leader, Michael Howard, who appealed to Ukip voters to back the Conservatives' bid to \"bring power back from Brussels\".</p> <p>Despite Conservative briefings yesterday that Europe would not play a major part in Mr Howard's speech, it was central to his message of restoring accountability and trust to British politics.</p> <p><b>Deal accusations</b></p> <p>Labour meanwhile reacted to the news by accusing the Tories of striking a deal with Mr Sykes, who is known to have met with the party's deregulation spokesman and die-hard Eurosceptic, John Redwood.</p> <p>Cabinet Office minister Ruth Kelly said: \"this secret deal with the rightwing funder of Ukip shows that the Conservative party has not changed. </p> <p>\"They are still the same old Conservative party, still out of touch with the British people and still unable to reach out to voters in the centre ground.\" </p> <p>David Cameron, the Conservatives' policy chief, denied that a deal had been struck, telling Sky News that \"we are not going to do any deals with anybody\". </p> <p>\"What matters is doing the right thing for the country and taking back some of the powers from Brussels to make sure we have proper, good accountable government in Westminster,\" he added. </p> <p><b>Abandoning Ukip</b></p> <p>Speaking on the BBC Today programme this morning Mr Sykes said that it was it was the choice between Labour and the \"only one major party now that is anti-Brussels, that is for repatriating powers\" had had prompted his decision.</p> <p>Mr Sykes added that he was \"warming\" to what he was hearing from the Conservative party, adding: \"I have no intention whatsoever of upsetting their applecart.\"</p> <p>He later met with the former talkshow host and Ukip MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk, who announced the party's intention to \"kill\" the Tories as a political force at the weekend.</p> <p>Former Tory leader William Hague was not convinced, however, by Mr Sykes' promise of good behaviour, cautioning against a hardening of the party's position on Europe in an attempt to woo back Ukip supporters who once voted Conservative.</p> <p>\"I think the thing to do is not to buy off people who are thinking of voting for Ukip by a change in policy,\" he told the programme.</p> <p><b>Tory dilemma</b></p> <p>The Conservatives have been agonising about how to see off Ukip, which threatens to take Tory votes in the party's most marginal constituencies, without alienating centrist floating voters.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, warned at a conference fringe meeting yesterday that Ukip could lose the party between 30 and 50 seats at the general election unless it is stopped.</p> <p>\"We must get the country to buy its conservatism from the Conservatives,\" he said, suggesting that the Tories should concentrate on traditional rightwing issues such as crime and immigration.</p> <p>Mr Redwood, who has been key to Tory efforts to win over Mr Sykes, identified Europe \"above all\" as an election issue at a fringe meeting.</p> <p>However, his cabinet colleague Mr Cameron dismissed his call and insisted that the Tories needed to concentrate on issues preoccupying people \"in pubs and clubs\" and not \"wild forays into different areas\".</p> <p><b>Ukip disunity</b></p> <p>Mr Sykes' withdrawal of support from Ukip follows its conference vote to contest all parliamentary constituencies at the general election, and Mr Kilroy-Silk's appeal for the party to \"kill\" the Tories.</p> <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip's group of MEPs, today suggested that election decision may have been a misjudgment.</p> <p> \"The party went to its conference on Saturday in Bristol in euphoric mood. I think that amidst that euphoria we rather lost sight of our key objective,\" he told the Today programme.</p> <p> \"In my opinion we should not be fighting against sitting Tory and Labour MPs who are prepared to say the right things.\"</p> <p>The move to stand candidates in every seat was strongly supported by Mr Kilroy-Silk, the party's most prominent figure who went on to declare his ambition to replace its leader, Roger Knapman.</p> <p>However, Mr Farage said that the former daytime TV presenter would not succeed in his bid to take over the party and that Mr Knapman's position was safe.</p> <p> \"I am afraid that he is going to be disappointed there because there is no appetite within the party at all for any form of internecine warfare, so that isn't going to happen,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>So my shaky season came to an end when a fiend of a cold got its hands on me. Nature seemed to be saying: stop running! Sneezing, pale as monkfish and aching head to toe, there was only one place to go: bed. I decided to treat myself to a snotty-nosed, autumnal pyjama day. After an hour of lying limply inactive, pondering my recently deteriorating mental health, I remembered that I'm not very good at doing nothing. In fact, I'm useless at it. So I did what people like me do in situations like this, which is come up with a plan to do nothing in a productive way. </p> <p>I fetched a \"guided meditation\" CD called Overcoming Obstacles, something to play it on and my huge, old-fashioned, clunky headphones. Back in bed, inert as roadkill and resembling a Japanese cartoon character, I let the woman with the r-e-l-a-x-i-n-g voice tell me how I was going to overcome all the obstacles in my life. As her voice grew slower and slowerrrrrrrr, my recent sticky patch came into focus. I had been burning the candle at both ends, trying to be super dad, super husband, super son, super brother, super cleaner, super cook, super bill payer, super career person, super sinewy muscle pilates creature, super-bloody-everything-man. </p> <p>Then there's my coffee intake. Since becoming a dad, I've understood why Starbucks is always full of parents with small children or babies. Without caffeine, there would be no reproduction. As a new parent, I am seven parts coffee, one part blood and water. Consequently, I've gone completely over the top with the amount of coffee I drink, fuelling symptoms of anxiety, wantonly inviting panic attacks to waltz in and electrocute me. </p> <p>At Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, I learned an acronym that I rather like - \"HALT\", shorthand for \"Don't get too hungry, angry, lonely or tired\". Although I don't really get lonely because I've been a loner my whole life (I can happily pass entire days alone talking to staplers and spider plants), I'll freely admit that lately I've been more \"HAT\" than not. Hungry (for God's sake, where's my New York cheesecake?), Angry (like all recovering alcoholics, I'm human touch-paper when run down), Tired (newborn baby = sleepless in Ga-Ga-land). </p> <p>The woman with the dreamy, sleepy enunciation tells me to picture how I want my life to look and to visualise it inside a brilliant white circle. Away I go, quite the super-guided-meditation-man. And then she says, \"Prepare to overcome all your obstacles, centre yourself, breathe deeply.\" And then, seconds from enlightenment: Beep. Beep. Beep. The batteries on the CD player ran out. I threw the headphones down, ready to go seriously HAT. My wife appeared. I told her what happened. She started laughing. Then I started laughing. Then our 12-week-old daughter started grinning like a chipmunk. I peered into her beautiful little face and told her that technology had prevented Dad from overcoming his obstacles. She seemed to think this was funny too. </p> <p>For the rest of the day, I thought hard about this recent slump and looked for a causal chain of events. Clearing out some cupboards three weeks earlier, I had stumbled across a batch of old printed-out emails from my very dear friend who committed suicide four years ago. That shook me up for days. What's more, I'm now only weeks away from celebrating 10 years sober. That milestone feels like a big life moment for me. I'm nervous about it. Having pepped myself up with sugary cakes and ice-cream for the past God knows how long, I recently cut all sweet toothed indulgences from my diet, causing a mood crash. </p> <p>Today I'm going to eat something small and chocolatey in a bid to find the middle ground. Unfortunately, I was born without moderation software. My genetic package didn't come with Moderation 4.5 For Easily Addicted Depression-Prone Bookish Males Who Wear Black-Rimmed Glasses. And, lastly, this past month, I've let my yoga practice slip. No wonder I've been feeling downside-up. So that's back today too, no excuses. I'll leave you with another saying from AA meetings: \"More laundry, less drama.\" Simple but true. I'm off now to wash my daughter's latest batch of pooped-out clothes. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nickjohnstone.com\">www.nickjohnstone.com</a></p>",

  "<p>I was born and grew up in South Wales.</p> <p>As you may have heard, we've just been left off the new EU map.</p> <p>I know people in Brussels feel strongly about Neil Kinnock, but I really do think that is going too far.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to go to a very good grammar school.</p> <p>The first political meeting I ever went to was during a general election campaign. It was held by the local Labour Member of Parliament - a great man of his day, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p> <p>I asked him why Labour wanted to abolish grammar schools.</p> <p>And he replied: \"We don't want to abolish grammar schools. We want to make all schools grammar schools\".</p> <p>It was my first experience of a politician's answer.</p> <p>I don't believe in that kind of talk. </p> <p>I'm going to give it to you straight.</p> <p><strong>Rebuilding trust</strong></p> <p>Politicians - all politicians - have made promises they have failed to keep.</p> <p>In 1992 we promised to cut taxes year on year.</p> <p>But we put them up.</p> <p>In 1997 Labour said there would be no tax increases at all.</p> <p>They put them up.</p> <p>Not once, not twice but sixty six times.</p> <p>Sixty six broken promises.</p> <p>And people have been let down on Europe too.</p> <p>In the 1970s, Britain joined a common market. That's what the British people voted for.</p> <p>But it soon became clear our European partners wanted more. </p> <p>They wanted to build a country called Europe.</p> <p>The British people were told: \"Don't worry. France and Germany don't really want a country called Europe. They're coming our way.\"</p> <p>But they haven't come our way. </p> <p>Power has gone from Britain to Brussels. And that's not what the British people voted for.</p> <p>Let's face facts. What has happened on tax and on Europe has damaged people's faith in politics.</p> <p>So it's hardly surprising that people don't trust politicians today. </p> <p><strong>Accountability</strong></p> <p>In the real world, if you say you're going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you can lose your job. </p> <p>It's called accountability.</p> <p>Remember that word - accountability.</p> <p>But politicians seem to live in a different world. </p> <p>A world where promises are dropped just as casually as they're made. </p> <p>A world where the figures are fiddled. </p> <p>A world where there are no penalties for failure. </p> <p>What people want from their politicians is: Accountability. Responsibility. And a little humility.</p> <p>The very opposite of what we've had from Tony Blair.</p> <p>Politicians don't have all the solutions. </p> <p>They should stop pretending they do. </p> <p>So I won't pretend I can solve every problem, right every wrong or cure every ill. </p> <p>I'll leave that to the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>We will only promise what we can deliver. </p> <p>What we start, we will follow through.</p> <p>And we will give people clear measures against which we can be judged. </p> <p>That's why we're setting out a clear Timetable for Action.</p> <p>What we'll do. When we'll do it. Specific times, specific dates. </p> <p>It will put us on the line in a way that no government has ever been before. </p> <p>There will be no wiggle room.</p> <p>Everyone will be able to hold us to account.</p> <p>No dodgy facts and figures. </p> <p>We'll have no place to hide.</p> <p>Accountability.</p> <p>I'll choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver.</p> <p>And if they don't, I'll replace them with people who will.</p> <p>When you ask for people's votes, you have a responsibility to them.</p> <p>Casting a vote shouldn't be a mechanical choice between the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>It should be an opportunity to tell the world what sort of country you want.</p> <p>That's why politicians have a duty to respond to people's dreams and help make them a reality.</p> <p>It's not a crime to want a better school for your child, better healthcare for your mother, and a better life for your family.</p> <p>But it is criminal when politicians hold out these promises without a detailed, deliverable plan.</p> <p>People are fed up with talk. They want action.</p> <p><strong>Talk not action</strong></p> <p>Tony Blair has been all talk.</p> <p>He gets swept away with his rhetoric and his dreams.</p> <p>He's told us about the Euro being our \"destiny\".</p> <p>Well, you know, most people don't actually want a date with destiny. </p> <p>They just want a date with a dentist.</p> <p>Tony Blair has promised so much, but he has delivered so little. </p> <p>That's why people have come to think the problems we face are just like the British weather - something you moan about but cannot change.</p> <p>But we can get a grip on these problems. </p> <p>Where there is cynicism, we can bring hope.</p> <p>I'm not going to promise you a fantasy land.</p> <p>But I do want to take you to a foreign land.</p> <p>In France, they don't have waiting lists.</p> <p>In Sweden, parents can choose the school they want.</p> <p>And in New York, it's now criminals who walk in fear, not the public.</p> <p>I want Britain to be the country that is the envy of the world. And I know that this is the party that can make it happen.</p> <p>Because we instinctively trust the generosity, the initiative and the common sense of the British people.</p> <p><strong>Action on crime</strong></p> <p>And the first problem I'll get a grip on is crime.</p> <p>The gloves will come off.</p> <p>What Giuliani did in New York, what Ray Mallon did in Middlesbrough, we'll do for the whole of Britain. </p> <p>A war on crime.</p> <p>Three weeks ago, on a Saturday night, I went out on the streets of Brixton with people from local churches.</p> <p>I saw the problems their community is up against. </p> <p>In two hours we didn't meet a single policeman.</p> <p>Not one.</p> <p>This was inner city London, just before midnight, on a Saturday night. </p> <p>No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote. </p> <p>The problem is that the police are handcuffed by paperwork. They now have to spend almost as much time at the station as they do out on the streets.</p> <p>And now this Government is making it worse. </p> <p>The police will now have to fill in a form every time they stop someone. Not stop and search. Just stop someone.</p> <p>It takes seven minutes to complete that form. </p> <p>Just think about it. If a police officer stops half a dozen unruly youngsters, he'll have to spend the best part of an hour filling in forms. </p> <p>I don't want police filling in forms. I want them on the streets doing their job. </p> <p>People are fed up that when the police do catch criminals the punishment never seems to fit the crime.</p> <p>Under a new Labour law, shoplifters will only get a fixed penalty fine and no criminal record. Theft is now no worse than parking on a yellow line.</p> <p>I promise you I'm not making this up. </p> <p>And five years ago, Labour introduced an early release scheme. Since then 3,600 crimes - including rape - have been committed by criminals let out of prison early. Every one of those crimes could have been prevented.</p> <p>All this has to change.</p> <p>We need a government that will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. A government that will put their rights first.</p> <p>This is what David Davis will do.</p> <p>Day One. That form police officers will have to fill in every time they stop someone - that form will go into the appropriate filing tray. The bin.</p> <p>Week One. Labour's early release scheme - that will go. </p> <p>Month One. We'll start to recruit 5,000 more police officers a year.</p> <p>And we'll do something else. </p> <p>Career criminals and dangerous offenders should be in prison - not roaming our streets. </p> <p>So we will build more prisons.</p> <p><strong>Action on drugs</strong></p> <p>Everyone knows that drugs are at the root of a lot of crime. </p> <p>There can be few families not touched by the blight or worry of drugs.</p> <p>It's every parent's worst nightmare.</p> <p>I want to give hope and practical support to those families.</p> <p>Many addicts fall into crime to feed their habits.</p> <p>If they're caught, I think they should be given a choice. </p> <p>Prison or treatment.</p> <p>So we'll increase the number of rehab places ten fold - from 2,000 to 20,000.</p> <p>We must give families the chance to win back their children from drugs. </p> <p>Life is far too precious to be written off.</p> <p>Action on school discipline</p> <p>Drugs are a symptom of a wider problem.</p> <p>As a society, we've blurred the distinction between right and wrong. </p> <p>We've tolerated a slow but relentless decline in personal responsibility. </p> <p>Too many people now believe that they are no longer responsible for their actions. </p> <p>It's always someone else's fault.</p> <p>And while we've let responsibility decline, we've allowed \"rights\" to proliferate. You hear it all the time: \"I've got my rights\". The verbal equivalent of two-fingers to authority. </p> <p>The Human Rights Act has tipped the balance of justice away from the victim in favour of the troublemaker.</p> <p>That's why we're reviewing it. And if it can't be reformed, we'll get rid of it.</p> <p>We have also undermined discipline in schools. </p> <p>Too often teachers find their authority challenged when they discipline children.</p> <p>But teachers know their pupils. They know their names and they understand their character - what they are good at and what they find difficult. And we should trust them to exercise their common sense and judgement. </p> <p>So on day one, Tim Collins will start to give head teachers control over their classrooms. They'll have the final say on expulsions. Disruptive pupils won't be able to wreck other children's education.</p> <p><strong>Action on schools and hospitals</strong></p> <p>Hard working families want to restore respect and decent values. </p> <p>But they also want value for money for the taxes they pay.</p> <p>Billions of pounds of their money have been spent on education. But much of it has been wasted on bureaucracy.</p> <p>Twelve pages of government paperwork land on head teachers' desks every single day of the school year.</p> <p>And what do we have to show for it? </p> <p>A third of all eleven year olds still cannot write properly.</p> <p>Billions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been spent on the NHS. And what have we got to show for that? </p> <p>Bureaucrats, people waiting in pain for operations, dirty hospitals.</p> <p>More people die every year from hospital infections than are killed on Britain's roads.</p> <p>That's more than a statistic. </p> <p>It's a tragedy for thousands of families - including mine. </p> <p>Two years ago my mother-in-law died from a hospital acquired infection. </p> <p>Yes she was old. </p> <p>Yes she was frail. </p> <p>But she still enjoyed life. </p> <p>She need not have died. </p> <p>Britain needs a Government that will give hard working families value for the taxes they pay.</p> <p>And what greater value can there be than the dedication of those who work in our schools and hospitals?</p> <p>Look at the astonishing devotion to duty of our doctors and nurses. Their motives are the highest, their skills immense, their energy an inspiration.</p> <p>Think of the commitment of our teachers. Teaching is a noble profession. Teachers simply want the satisfaction - the sheer joy - of inspiring the next generation, and of passing on that most precious commodity, knowledge.</p> <p>Is it too much to ask that we trust their judgement, their experience and their expertise?</p> <p>Let's set them free to follow their vocation, and give of their best. </p> <p>So in week one, Andrew Lansley and Tim Collins will start to scrap Whitehall targets for hospitals and schools. </p> <p>Teachers will run our schools. </p> <p>And doctors and nurses will run our hospitals. </p> <p>We'll trust patients and parents too - so they can choose the hospital and school which best suits them and their family.</p> <p>No-one should have to shut up and just take what they're given.</p> <p>Conservatives will give everyone the kind of choice in health and education that today only money can buy.</p> <p>That's what I call social justice.</p> <p>There are people in Britain who have to wait months for operations on the NHS. Not far from where they live, other more fortunate people only have to wait weeks.</p> <p>We've all paid for the NHS.</p> <p>It's our NHS.</p> <p>So why shouldn't you be able to go to the hospitals that can treat you more quickly? </p> <p>With the Conservatives, you will.</p> <p>We'll also give more choice to parents.</p> <p>Parents know better than anyone what is best for their children. </p> <p>If we want selection, if we want school uniforms, if we want schools that excel at sport, as parents we should be able to choose them. </p> <p>That is the way to give parents the good local schools we all want.</p> <p>But giving parents and patients choice, and giving professionals more control, means cutting back on the pen pushers who run too much of our lives.</p> <p>On day one, Oliver Letwin will freeze civil service recruitment. And I'll do my bit too.</p> <p>In Downing Street there's something called the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit. </p> <p>Yes, the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit. Now there's a contradiction in terms.</p> <p>That Delivery Unit was recently advertising for jobs. </p> <p>Job Title: Joint Action Leaders.</p> <p>Joint Action Leaders.</p> <p>What on earth does that mean?</p> <p>What do these people actually do?</p> <p>I've got the ad here.</p> <p>Let me read it to you.</p> <p>Applicants \"need a track record of diagnosing, analysing and developing workable solutions to key blockages to public service delivery\". </p> <p>Well that's clear then. It's Dyno Rod in Downing Street.</p> <p>And for key blockages, read Gordon Brown.</p> <p>These Joint Action Leaders are paid \u00a370,000 a year each - much more than an experienced midwife gets in a real delivery unit bringing babies into the world. </p> <p>In week one of a Conservative Government, I will order the closure of the Downing Street Delivery Unit. </p> <p>It may not be the biggest waste of money in Whitehall. But it sums up what's going wrong. Tony Blair's got a Delivery Unit - but there's no delivery.</p> <p>I won't have a Delivery Unit - but I will deliver.</p> <p><strong>Action on pensions</strong></p> <p>I will deliver for pensioners.</p> <p>If you want to know about a family, look at how they treat their older relatives. </p> <p>And if you want to know about a country, look how it cares for older people.</p> <p>It's a scandal that this Government took the best pensions system in Europe and turned it into one of the worst.</p> <p>Can you imagine what it feels like to have saved for your retirement only to find that the money you've put aside isn't there? That the value of your pension has been destroyed by Gordon Brown's stealth taxes? </p> <p>How are pensioners on fixed incomes meant to cope with an ever increasing Council Tax?</p> <p>And what a way to treat people who have worked hard and saved all their lives - to make them fill in a twelve page means test form to get what they are due.</p> <p>I want to live in a country where we honour our older generations, cherish their wisdom and care for their needs.</p> <p>A country where they can live out their days in security and with dignity. </p> <p>Respected. </p> <p>Protected. </p> <p>To those who have given so much, we must surely give more.</p> <p>That is why in our first month David Willetts will take steps to restore the link between pensions and earnings. There'll be an extra \u00a37 a week if you live on your own, and an extra \u00a311 a week for a couple.</p> <p>We need a Government which gives pensioners back their dignity.</p> <p>That's what most people want. But only a Conservative Government will deliver it. So my message to you is simple. If you want to give pensioners back their dignity, whatever party you are from, come and join us.</p> <p><strong>Action on tax</strong></p> <p>But pensioners are not the only ones who have been let down. </p> <p>Everyone's been let down by Labour on tax. </p> <p>I want to help those who want to get on in life. The family with a new baby who need a bigger home. The couple who both work, but still don't seem able to make ends meet. </p> <p>Today they are all paying the price of a government that is taxing too much. </p> <p>Young couples, wanting to buy their first home, face hundreds of pounds of Stamp Duty.</p> <p>The poorest households shoulder the highest burden.</p> <p>And teachers, doctors and policemen now pay top rate Income Tax. </p> <p>People who bought their council houses in the 1980s are now being clobbered by Inheritance Tax.</p> <p>This is all wrong. It's unfair.</p> <p>And there's more trouble ahead. </p> <p>Whatever the uncertainty about Tony Blair's future, one thing is certain. If Labour were to win again, we'd have Blair's third term tax rises. </p> <p>And they'd be painful indeed. Council Tax for the typical family of \u00a32,000 a year.</p> <p>Conservatives will stop Blair's third term tax rises dead in their tracks. </p> <p>We'll get a grip on public spending.</p> <p>We'll save billions of pounds by cutting government waste.</p> <p>And that will help to put us back on the path to lower taxes. </p> <p>People work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of it.</p> <p>Families know better than any government can how best to spend their money.</p> <p>So be in no doubt.</p> <p>When I can, I will cut taxes.</p> <p>This week we have set out the taxes we have in our sights - the taxes I want to make fairer, simpler, lower.</p> <p>But I'm not like Tony Blair. I'm not going to make promises I can't keep. </p> <p>I don't want you to leave this hall today with a false prospectus. </p> <p>We must be honest with the British people. </p> <p>It's that word again - accountability.</p> <p><strong>Action on Europe</strong></p> <p>I want to be accountable on Europe too. </p> <p>On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the Constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October.</p> <p>Europe isn't working properly today and the Constitution will only make matters worse.</p> <p>The European Union is spewing out too many regulations. It's holding our economy back. </p> <p>We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline.</p> <p>We need a new approach to Europe.</p> <p>Let me explain why.</p> <p>The British people don't want to be part of a European super state. But other European governments are determined to press ahead with ever closer integration. Britain has tried to stop them. </p> <p>So all we get are arguments and bust ups. Everyone feels frustrated.</p> <p>It's not a terribly clever policy.</p> <p>This is what I will do.</p> <p>Some of our European partners want to integrate further. I'll say to them - \"fine. Britain will no longer try and stop you. But we must have something in return. We want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain\".</p> <p>It is not enough to say No to the European Constitution - though a Conservative Government will.</p> <p>It is not enough to say No to the Euro - though a Conservative Government will.</p> <p>It's time we went further.</p> <p>We want out of the social chapter, which is a threat to British jobs.</p> <p>We want out of the common fisheries policy, which is destroying communities.</p> <p>And we want more British aid to be distributed from London and less from Brussels. It's time to bring powers back to Britain.</p> <p>There's a word for it - accountability.</p> <p>That's what most people want. </p> <p>But only a Conservative Government can deliver it. </p> <p>So my message to you is simple. </p> <p>If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you're from, come and join us. </p> <p><strong>Action on immigration</strong></p> <p>The British people are open, generous and compassionate. </p> <p>We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to people fleeing persecution, and welcoming families who want to settle here and work. </p> <p>We have a long tradition of firm but fair immigration controls. </p> <p>But today, immigration is chaotic and out of control. </p> <p>Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country.</p> <p>And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent.</p> <p>All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused.</p> <p>And they are increasingly concerned about the impact of immigration on our public services - our schools, hospitals and transport. </p> <p>But that's hardly surprising. </p> <p>Immigration has doubled under Labour. </p> <p>And we have a Home Secretary who believes that there is \"no obvious upper limit to legal immigration\".</p> <p>I think we've reached a turning point.</p> <p>We cannot allow unlimited immigration to Britain to continue.</p> <p>We need a Government that gets a grip on this shambles. </p> <p>A government which helps genuine refugees. </p> <p>A government that gives priority to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our country.</p> <p>So in week one, Michael Ancram will signal Britain's intention to pull out of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. We want asylum cases to be decided more quickly and more fairly. We want to allow genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue.</p> <p>That's what I call fair.</p> <p>And in month one, we'll set out plans to enable Parliament to put an annual limit on the number of people who come to Britain. </p> <p>No Conservative Home Secretary will ever say \"there is no obvious limit to legal immigration\".</p> <p><strong>Dangerous world</strong></p> <p>When the Cold War ended, we all hoped that our children and grandchildren would grow up in a safer world. </p> <p>That hope was shattered on September 11th 2001.</p> <p>Our world changed. Taking a plane, going on the Tube - all these things suddenly carried a new risk.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we face the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. </p> <p>How do we confront this sense of insecurity? How do we tackle these threats?</p> <p>First, people need to be told the truth about the threats we face. And if we consider the threat to our freedom and our interests merit military action, we should not flinch.</p> <p>Every day British servicemen and women face great danger in Iraq. The way they carry out their duties does Britain proud, and makes Britain proud. </p> <p>I believe it was right to go to war. That's a controversial view. Many people would prefer me to say something else. But that is how I see it. And I owe it to you to tell you how I see it.</p> <p>The world is a better place without Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Saddam had provoked two wars in the Gulf. He had used chemical weapons against other nations and against his own people. No one knew if and when he would get his hands on more weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>So I think it was right to go to war. But I also think it's right to tell the truth.</p> <p>In the run-up to the war, Tony Blair did not tell the truth. He did not give a truthful account of the intelligence he received. He did not behave as a British Prime Minister should. </p> <p>Tony Blair has said that mistakes were made. He has said he accepts responsibility. But it is not a question of responsibility. It is a question of credibility. </p> <p>I hope that we will not face another war. </p> <p>But the world is a very dangerous place, and you can never be sure.</p> <p>What if this Prime Minister asks people to trust him again? Could the British people trust him a second time?</p> <p><strong>Conservative beliefs</strong></p> <p>If you want people to trust you, you must trust them. </p> <p>Of course, I don't believe that we are right about everything and Labour politicians are wrong about everything.</p> <p>Neither party has a monopoly on virtue.</p> <p>But I do believe that there are times in our history when Conservative ideas are more relevant to the challenges Britain faces. And we have reached one of those times today.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I believe that if people are given a choice, they will make the right decision for themselves and their families.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I understand that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than governments are.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I want people to be big, and the State to be small.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I know that government should be accountable to the people, not people to the government. </p> <p>And I am a Conservative because I have an inherent belief in fair play - no-one should be over-mighty, not the trade unions, not the State, not corporations, not the European Union - not even the Prime Minister.</p> <p>We want to live in a society where people have the freedom to get on in life and get on with their lives, safe in the knowledge that government will provide them with security. Freedom and security: two timeless Conservative ambitions. </p> <p>This is what makes me a Conservative. And I believe it's what makes all of you Conservatives.</p> <p>So when people ask you on the doorstep:</p> <p>\"I can't stand Tony Blair, but why should I vote for you lot?\"</p> <p>Here are ten words to remember.</p> <p>School discipline.</p> <p>More police.</p> <p>Cleaner hospitals.</p> <p>Lower taxes.</p> <p>Controlled immigration.</p> <p>Ten words to address the problems that are worrying people today.</p> <p>Remember those words.</p> <p>And remember one more: accountability.</p> <p>Don't forget to tell them. We won't just make a difference. We'll be different. </p> <p>We'll be accountable to them.</p> <p>We'll do what we say.</p> <p>There'll be less talk, more action.</p> <p>Optimistic about our people's future? Yes.</p> <p>Ambitious for Britain? Certainly.</p> <p>But always utterly practical</p> <p>Ours is a philosophy that is rooted in reality.</p> <p>And it delivers.</p> <p>Britain is the best country in the world</p> <p>It delivers for our country. </p> <p>We all love our country.</p> <p>But everything I have and everything I am I owe to this country. </p> <p>I was born in July 1941, two weeks after Hitler invaded Russia. </p> <p>Those were very dark days. </p> <p>In the next four years millions of people were killed. </p> <p>Many lost their lives on the battlefield, at sea and in the air. </p> <p>Many lost their lives in cities blitzed from the air. </p> <p>And many lost their lives in the concentration camps set up by one of the cruellest tyrannies the world has ever known. </p> <p>My grandmother was one of those killed in the concentration camps.</p> <p>If it hadn't been for Winston Churchill, and if it hadn't been for Britain, I would have been one of them too. </p> <p>That's why when I say I owe everything I am to this country, I really do mean it.</p> <p>I owe my life to it.</p> <p>My father told me Britain was the best country in the world. </p> <p>I think it was. </p> <p>And I think it still is. </p> <p>But I know we could be doing so much better. </p> <p>And it's because I think I can help make things better that I am standing before you today.</p> <p>Put simply, I'm here so I can give back to Britain a tiny fraction of what Britain has given to me.</p>",

  "Michael Howard today blamed the EU for the growing distrust of politicians and politics and promised to \"bring power back to Britain\" in a passionately patriotic conference address. <p>In his first conference speech as Tory leader, Mr Howard sought to couple his call to rebuild trust in politics with his plans to repatriate powers from the EU, saying that both amounted to a return to accountability.</p> <p>Broken promises on tax and the unwanted metamorphosis of the EU from a common market to a fledgling superstate have \"damaged people's faith in politics\", he said.</p> <p>\"Politicians - all politicians - have made promises they have failed to keep. In 1992 we promised to cut taxes year on year. But we put them up. In 1997 Labour said there would be no tax increases at all. They put them up.\"</p> <p>He added: \"And people have been let down on Europe too. In the 1970s, Britain joined a common market. That's what the British people voted for. But it soon became clear that our European partners wanted more. They wanted to build a country called Europe.\"</p> <p>As part of his timetable for action - commitments for the first day, week and month of a Conservative government - Mr Howard promised to set an early date for a referendum on the EU constitution on his first day in office.</p> <p>He also promised to cut a deal with European leaders if he was elected prime minister, allowing them to push forward with further integration in return for them permitting him to repatriate \"powers back from Brussels to Britain\".</p> <p>Mr Howard described his plans to scrap the social chapter, pull out of the common fisheries policy, and distribute aid from London rather than Brussels as a return to accountability.</p> <p>\"It's time to bring powers back to Britain. There's a word for it - accountability. That's what people want. But only a Conservative government can deliver it. </p> <p>\"So my message to you is simple. If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you're from, come and join us.\"</p> <p>Mr Howard's strong Eurosceptic message will be seen as an appeal to supporters of the UK Independence party to return to the Tory fold, as Ukip's biggest donor, Paul Sykes did last night. </p> <p>The millionaire businessman, who is believes to have donated over a \u00a31m to the anti-EU party, said he was abandoning Ukip after it had \"blown it\" by deciding to stand against every Tory MP whatever their view on Europe.</p> <p>Mr Sykes' decision has provided a fillip to a Tory conference downhearted after recent opinion polls have shown the party's and Mr Howard's ratings well below those of Labour and Tony Blair.</p> <p>But it has spread unease among leading Conservatives, who believe that an overemphasis on Europe will put off centrist floating voters more concerned with more mainstream issues such a education, health and tax.</p> <p>Conscious of the need to unveil promises believable to an increasingly cynical electorate, Mr Howard also announced a series of modest \"timetable for action\" commitments.</p> <p>On crime he promised that day one of a Tory government would see the abolition of the police's obligation to fill out a form every time they stop and search somebody - one of the recommendations of the Macpherson inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>Week one would see the scrapping of the early release scheme for offenders, while month one would mark the start to the recruitment of 5,000 more police officers per year.</p> <p>A Conservative government would also start the slimming down of \"fat government\" by freezing civil service recruitment on its first day in office, and abolishing the Downing Street delivery unit in its first week.</p> <p>Mr Howard said: \"I won't have a delivery unit - but I will deliver.\"</p> <p>On pensions, he promised to restore the link between state pensions and average earnings in his first month in power, while on immigration he would announce that Britain is to rip up the 1951 UN refugee convention in week one and set out plans to apply an annual limit on immigration in month one.</p> <p>Like the shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, yesterday, Mr Howard declined to make any specific promises on tax but he was clear in his aim to make cuts when he can.</p> <p>\"Be in no doubt. When I can, I will cut taxes.\"</p> <p>The Tory leader also promised to be tough on ministers who failed to live up to his pledges. \"I'll choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver,\" he said. \"And if they don't, I'll replace them with people who will.\"</p> <p>Mr Howard summarised his speech with \"10 words to remember\": school discipline, more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, and controlled immigration.</p> <p>He ended with an impassioned appeal to be allowed to serve the country that he owed his life to.</p> <p>Stepping away from the podium and speaking without the aid of the teleprompter, he said: \"My grandmother was one of those killed in the concentration camps. If it hadn't been for Winston Churchill, and if it hadn't have been for Britain, I would have been one of them.</p> <p>\"That's why when I say I owe everything I am to this country, I really mean it. I owe my life to Britain... I want to give Britain just a tiny bit back in return for what Britain has give me.\" </p> <p>To the sound of Elgar's famously patriotic Nimrod, Mr Howard received a three-minute standing ovation from the conference delegates.</p>",
  "A Save the Pound bathrobe is walking towards me. Inside it is Edith Bigg, a tall, grey blur. \"Save the pound!\" she says to me. \"Save the pound!\" I am in a very strange place. The UK Independence Party (Ukip) is holding its annual conference in Bristol. As I walk past Robert Kilroy-Silk's Bentley, a lone female protester shouts \"Racists!\" in my vague direction. I am greeted by a triumvirate of Staffordshire Ukip members. \"We are going to gain control of national politics in the House of Commons,\" says a Mr Goode, an engineer specialising in steel fabrications. \"We will bring back Common Sense to our nation.\" His friends nod. <p>Inside, my bag is searched by smiling women \"for flour and eggs, my dear\". Might I bake a Ukip cake to hurl at Kilroy's perfect nose? I see facial hair, 1930s hats, Arran sweaters, angry vicars, fishermen and Jonathan Aitken. If Agatha Christie had written a political thriller, or if Engelbert Humperdink's fan-club entered parliament, this is what it would look like. It is, for a grimy urbanite, very strange indeed. </p> <p>The party certainly has a theme: two enormous gold pound signs, sliced in two to accommodate the Ukip logo, are suspended, twinkling, over the stage. Opposite, basking in their light, are the 1,100 old and middle-aged faces who delivered seven million leaflets back in June. I also see a very young black girl in the second row. </p> <p>Petrina Holdsworth, the party chair, an elegant former barrister on secondment from a Joanna Trollope novel, is in the spotlight onstage, directing the party onwards. \"We remember June, when Ukip came of age,\" she says in perfect posh talk. \"We educated the British public. No to more European integration!\" My attention is stolen by Stephen Anderson, the man who pushed the Tories into fourth place in the Hartlepool byelection. He has mounted the platform and is addressing the delegates. \"Kilroy,\" he explains, \"came to Hartlepool and literally stopped traffic!\" </p> <p>Chris Leas, a short man who looks like a gangster, mounts the podium. Boy does he mount it. He is angry. He is very angry. He exclaims that two years ago, \"I walked out of my nice villa in Marbella and I was arrested for being an international drug smuggler. I was imprisoned for 50 weeks without charge.\" This is, he says, thanks to the fascistic Euro police. \"I made a vow to see the relentless juggernaut of Brussels stop before this happens to others in this great country.\" </p> <p>I am confused. My confusion is suddenly washed away by The Man Himself. The \"Kilroy phenomenon\" is here. Kilroy-Silk joined the party four months ago, but speaks like a man who has given it his life. Like a human bottle of hairspray, upright, golden and faintly poisonous, he begins. \"I've been dying to meet you,\" he drawls, as if the assembled ranks of Ukip supporters were a woman he is trying to seduce. He holds its hand and caresses its wrist. \"You panicked the major parties; you scared them to death. These things are not supposed to happen.\" Then he lays a hand on Ukip's crotch. \"This success is yours. It's been a long road for many of us. We can change the face of Britain and we are going to change it! Our opportunity is today - not tomorrow!\" He almost said: \"Tomorrow belongs to me.\" </p> <p>Kilroy dedicates 10 minutes to denying that the party is racist, so I decide to track down the Ukip Black Person I had spotted earlier, one of only three ethnic-minority members I could find. She is a sweet A-level student from north London called Jummy Olajide. She is currently doing work experience for Ukip's deputy leader, Mike Nattrass. Her parents are Nigerian. She featured in the party political broadcast. I ask her why she joined Ukip. \"I agree with their immigration policy,\" she says (this is essentially, like the Gucci shop in Selfridges, one in, one out). Nattrass says, \"We've got to go.\" </p> <p>I decide to track down the leaders of Ukip, who were pressing the flesh in the lobby. There is Nigel Farage, MEP, a handsome giggling 40-year-old. He was Ukip's darling before Kilroy stole his smile; \"The leadership was his for the taking two years ago\" I am told. I find Roger Knapman, the leader, fat and smiling, a former Tory Whip under John Major. There is Godfrey Bloom MEP, whose infamous command that women clean fridges made a splash, flirtatious and a little camp. And the gorgeous Petrina - who wants to \"send the members back inspired\". </p> <p>I bump into Jonathan Aitken, who joined Ukip five months ago - \"before the Euro elections,\" he says pointedly. He tells me that he and Kilroy became MPs on the same day and have toured the Middle East together. He says he hasn't made up his mind if he will stand for Ukip in his old constituency of Thanet. \"This is a serious party growing in confidence and support and serious voting power. I would distance myself from any party that is racist and so would Robert Kilroy-Silk.\" I can smell on Aitken the lust to return to parliament. It mingles with his aftershave. </p> <p>Finally I find Kilroy. He stands in front of a crowd of admirers and the television crew that seems to be surgically attached to him. \"The Labour party started with three people,\" he says. \"And things happen quicker these days.\" How is his fundraising? \"I've got more money promised me than I can spend.\" He flashes a Mephistophelean smile. </p> <p>An excited, murmuring queue had formed at the parliamentary candidates' desk. Everyone, it seems, wants to enter parliament. They each receive a form, which requests details of criminal convictions, \"anything that might cause embarrassment were it to be revealed\" and signed confirmation that they \"have never been a member of a racist organisation\". Ukip had a purge of BNP infiltrators two years ago and claims to be watchful for Christian fundamentalists who might sneak in. </p> <p>I hurry back to the hall for the great debate of the weekend. The party has to decide whether to contest every seat in the next general election, or to back off if sitting MPs agree to push their eurosceptic line. Do they want to steal the Tory crown or just mend it? To much cheering the result is announced: they will contest every seat. Michael Howard - sweat, baby. </p> <p>In the pub I encounter Reg Mahrra, an Indian Ukipper . \"I want out of Europe,\" he says. \"Europe is a disease.\" He describes himself as \"a social animal\" who \"knew Barry White once\", and adds, \"I have mixed with the criminal fraternity all my life.\" He confirms that, like almost everyone else, he wants to stand for parliament. Nearby is a member with a charismatic moustache called Roy Woodwood. He rails against the government that \"sold us down the canal\". He particularly hates \"the tosspot despot Prescott\". </p> <p>Sunday brings us drama. Kilroy has attempted a putsch on the Frost Show. He wants the leadership and hopes to persuade Roger to retire. What does Roger think? Does he mind? \"When I became leader no one else wanted it,\" he says smiling. \"I have been elected for four years and I have only served two years and one day. I intend to serve the remaining year and 364 days. Now everyone seems to want the job. This is a sign we are a healthy party.\" Will he accept Aitken as a parliamentary candidate? \"I hope he'll put his name forward to the appropriate committee and I hope the decision will be taken by those who know him best.\" </p> <p>The perjurer and the hair-spray are not loved here. I take the temperature of the Kilroy putsch with the party members. Has the chat-show lizard prevailed? Not yet. The grassroots are angry with their phenomenon, who has disappeared. \"He's only been here five minutes,\" I'm told. \"What about Roger? Roger has done everything for us. Kilroy must prove himself. He's only a minor celebrity after all.\" </p> <p>Wandering into the press room, I find Dick Morris, Bill Clinton's former spin doctor who quit after being caught in a rumpled bed with a prostitute. He has been drafted in as a consultant. Sleek and fat, he reminds me of an intelligent pigeon. He compares British politics to a sinking boat. \"There are lots of people on this boat who want different movies, food and destinations. But we are the only party that is concerned the boat is sinking.\" </p> <p>Outside the churning conference, the protest has swelled to three. \"You're as mad as a box of frogs!\" shouts a Ukip member. I return to the hall. The compere is dragging forward the \"unsung heroes\" of Ukip. Somebody named A Badger has been nominated by a Miss Bull. Suddenly, Jummy is on-stage and looking petrified. \"Jummy is rather coloured,\" says the compere. \"This proves we are a multiracial party.\" He rubs her hand, and puts an arm around her. \"It doesn't come off.\" </p> <p>The conference closes with Knapman, the leader Kilroy wants to oust. \"You have proved you are winners!\" Then he quotes Victor Hugo: \"Nothing can stop an idea whose time has come.\" </p> <p>I find I have developed a fondness for these fervent amateurs. Last week I was at the Labour party conference, surrounded by self-important glossy robots. These people, weird, creepy and bizarre though they are, are real. As I gather my things and prepare to leave Ukip-land, an angry man is clutching the podium, railing against the Euro fiend. He is interrupted by the Tannoy. \"A gentleman has lost his ride to Tunbridge Wells,\" it says. \"Can anyone else offer one?\" The man begins to speak again but there is another announcement. \"The Ukip Montego,\" it tells us, 'is about to be towed away.\"</p>",
  "An incoming Conservative government would make a \"war on crime\" the centrepiece of its plans to make Britain a country envied around the world, Michael Howard was telling his party conference today. <p>In a no-nonsense address, the Tory leader was also laying out plans for new action on drug abuse, tougher discipline in schools and radical measures to control immigration. </p> <p>Mr Howard, who was buoyed up earlier today by news that the UK Independence party had lost its biggest financial backer, the multi-millionaire Paul Sykes, also signalled a determination to take powers back from Brussels. </p> <p>He promised that on its first day in power a Conservative government would set the date for the referendum on the European constitution - the Tories want the British people to reject the document. </p> <p>Although he refrained from promising to cut particular taxes, Mr Howard reassured his audience that: \"When I can, I will cut taxes.\" </p> <p>On crime, Mr Howard pledged: \"The first problem I'll get a grip on is crime. The gloves will come off.\" </p> <p>He promised to copy the \"zero tolerance\" approach to crime pioneered in New York. </p> <p>\"What [Rudi] Giuliani did in New York, what Ray Mallon did in Middlesbrough, we'll do for the whole of Britain. A war on crime.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard said: \"We need a government that will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. A government that will put their rights first.\" </p> <p>And Mr Howard, who as home secretary famously declared that \"prison works\" , promised: \"Career criminals and dangerous offenders should be in prison - not roaming our streets. So we will build more prisons.\" </p> <p>On immigration, Mr Howard said that in its first week, a Tory government would signal its intention to withdraw from the 1951 UN refugee convention. </p> <p><b>Police reforms</b></p> <p>Mr Howard went on to tell his audience: \"Three weeks ago, on a Saturday night, I went out on the streets of Brixton with people from local churches. I saw the problems their community is up against. </p> <p>\"In two hours we didn't meet a single policeman. Not one. This was inner city London, just before midnight, on a Saturday night. No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote. </p> <p>\"The problem is that the police are handcuffed by paperwork. They now have to spend almost as much time at the station as they do out on the streets. </p> <p>\"And now this government is making it worse. The police will now have to fill in a form every time they stop someone. Not stop and search. Just stop someone. </p> <p>\"It takes seven minutes to complete that form. Just think about it. If a police officer stops half a dozen unruly youngsters, he'll have to spend the best part of an hour filling in forms. </p> <p>\"I don't want police filling in forms. I want them on the streets doing their job. </p> <p>\"People are fed up that when the police do catch criminals the punishment never seems to fit the crime. Under a new Labour law, shoplifters will only get a fixed penalty fine and no criminal record. Theft is now no worse than parking on a yellow line. </p> <p>\"I promise you I'm not making this up. </p> <p>\"And five years ago, Labour introduced an early release scheme. Since then 3,600 crimes - including rape - have been committed by criminals let out of prison early. Every one of those crimes could have been prevented. </p> <p>\"All this has to change. </p> <p>\"Day One: That form police officers will have to fill in every time they stop someone, that form will go into the appropriate filing tray - the bin. </p> <p>\"Week One: Labour's early release scheme - that will go. </p> <p>\"Month One: We'll start to recruit 5,000 more police officers a year.\" </p> <p><b>Limiting immigration</b></p> <p>On immigration and asylum, Mr Howard accused the Labour government of presiding over a \"chaotic and out of control\" system. </p> <p>\"Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country. And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent. </p> <p>\"All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused. And they are increasingly concerned about the impact of immigration on our public services our schools, hospitals and transport. </p> <p>\"But that's hardly surprising. Immigration has doubled under Labour. And we have a home secretary who believes that 'there is no obvious legal limit to legal immigration'.\" </p> <p>\"I think we've reached a turning point. We cannot allow unlimited immigration to Britain to continue. We need a government that gets a grip on this shambles. </p> <p>\"A government which helps genuine refugees. A government that gives priority to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our country. </p> <p>\"So in week one, Michael Ancram (now shadow foreign secretary) will signal Britain's intention to pull out of the 1951 UN refugee convention. We want asylum cases to be decided more quickly and more fairly. We want to allow genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue. That's what I call fair. </p> <p>\"And in month one, we'll set out plans to enable parliament to put an annual limit on the number of people who come to Britain. </p> <p>\"No Conservative home secretary will ever say 'there is no obvious legal limit to legal immigration'.\" </p> <p><b>Early vote on EU constitution</b></p> <p>On Britain's relations with the EU, Mr Howard told conference: \"On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. \"Europe isn't working properly today and the constitution will only make matters worse. </p> <p>\"The European Union is spewing out too many regulations. It's holding our economy back. We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard argued that the time had come for Britain to opt out of what he described as the momentum towards \"ever closer integration.\" </p> <p>\"This is what I will do. Some of our European partners want to integrate further. I'll say to them 'Fine. Britain will no longer try and stop you. But we must have something in return. We want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain'.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard argued: \"It is not enough to say no to the European constitution - though a Conservative government will. It is not enough to say no to the euro - though a Conservative government will. </p> <p>\"It's time we went further. We want out of the social chapter, which is a threat to British jobs. We want out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which is destroying communities. And we want more British aid to be distributed from London and less from Brussels. </p> <p>\"It's time to bring powers back to Britain.\" </p> <p>He added: \"My message to you is simple. If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you're from, come and join us.\" </p>",
  "The Tory party policy coordinator's speech at the Independent fringe meeting, entitled \"How do the Conservatives win this time?\" <p>You've given me 5 minutes.</p> <p>Let me try it in a sentence.</p> <p>By emphasising the Conservative values that the vast majority of the British public share, by turning them into Conservative polices - and by showing how we would put them in to action.</p> <p>In other words: values, policies and action.</p> <p>Before expanding on that let me say how we don't win.</p> <p>We don't win by a fruitless search for differences between us and our opponents where none really exist. It's opportunist Punch and Judy politics. It's unattractive and it doesn't work. </p> <p>We have to forget about what Blair is going to say tomorrow or the next day. I don't know what he's going to say. He doesn't know what he is going to say. </p> <p>We should just get on and do what we think is right.</p> <p>Second, we won't win by picking one subject - whether it is Europe or anything else - and talking about it incessantly. People want their political parties to tackle the broad range of issues that they care about. In the main that means schools, hospitals, crime, immigration and the economy. </p> <p>If you don't sound balanced, you won't seem balanced.</p> <p>Third, we won't win by being exclusively negative. People now know they have been let down by Labour. We reminded them of that- quite rightly- during the local election campaign. They don't need anymore reminders from us. And every reminder we send probably says as much about us as it does about them. </p> <p>It's time to accentuate the positive...</p> <p>So, back to the simple formulation - values, policies and action.</p> <p>Above all we have to recognise that the biggest problem in British politics today is cynicism, apathy and disillusion. They are the enemy, not Labour or the Liberals.</p> <p>How many times have we all heard on the doorstep - \"you're all the same\", \"you won't make any difference\", ending with the question: \"what's the point?\"</p> <p>Judging from the turn out at general local and by-elections, most people's answer to that last question - \"what's the point?\" - is that there isn't any.</p> <p>Labour and the Conservatives are marooned on broadly the same poll rating, somewhere in the low 30s. </p> <p>They're there because they've let people down. We're there because people don't yet think that we will make any difference. The Liberals are doing well, more than anything else, because they are not either of us.</p> <p>But I'm upbeat.</p> <p>There are three questions that matter in terms of political success. </p> <p>Do people share your values?</p> <p>Do they agree with you about what's wrong?</p> <p>And do they think you have the right plans for doing something about it?</p> <p>The answer to the first question about values is good for the Conservatives. Why else do you think the focus group obsessed Labour party has been so timid?</p> <p>Should crime be punished or tolerated? Does Britain do best when it is control of its own destiny? </p> <p>Are families the key building block of a stable society? Does equality of opportunity matter more than equality of outcome? Are our institutions a source of strength not a cause of weakness?</p> <p>Should we encourage people to do more for themselves when they can? </p> <p>All value questions - and all get a Conservative answer almost anywhere in the country you care to ask them.</p> <p>Answers to questions about what is wrong in Blair's Britain are just as encouraging. </p> <p>Here I admit, we've checked with polls and focus groups. </p> <p>Do people think that crime is rising and the hands of the police are tied by bureaucracy and paperwork? Yes.</p> <p>Do people think that hospital managers and head teachers are too busy looking up to Whitehall to manage effectively? Yes.</p> <p>Do people feel over-taxed and in awe of third-term tax rises and a \u00a32,000 council tax. Yes. They don't just think these taxes are coming if Labour win again - they know they are coming.</p> <p>So that brings us to the big one - \"do people agree with our plans?\" </p> <p>First, they don't know enough - if anything at all - about them. </p> <p>Second, even if they do, because of the wall of cynicism and disillusion, they don't believe we will achieve them.</p> <p>That's why the Timetable of Action being published this week is so important. It will tell you what we will do in the first day, the first week, the first month. </p> <p>It gives you details of the first queen's speech and the first budget. It is about being accountable. </p> <p>It is about people feeling that they are in charge again, and not the politicians. To make sure we are the servants, not the masters.</p> <p>Two last points.</p> <p>Does the Conservative party need to modernise itself? </p> <p>Yes, of course. If you don't understand the complexities and changing nature of modern society you are irrelevant. </p> <p>If you don't address the modern concerns of a modern country, you are dead. </p> <p>Second, by saying that most people in this country share broadly Conservative values, have I said enough? </p> <p>No. We have to make sure that we include all of those values.</p> <p>That we have a vision of society. That we believe we have obligations unto each other. That there is a net beneath which no one should fall. That there is a \"we\" as well as a \"me\".</p> <p>As I look at a Labour government that is closing special schools for disabled children, that is throwing wardens out of sheltered accommodation schemes, that endlessly threatens community hospitals, that offers drug addicts the sort of treatment place that is worse than useless and that crushes the voluntary and charitable sectors with its belief that \"Society is the State\" - nothing more, nothing less - there has never been a greater need for Conservatives to explain our view of society, our obligations to each other and our compassion for those in need.</p> <p>And with everything I've said - I hope we can inject some passion - as well as compassion - into what we say at the same time. </p> <p>So how do we win? </p> <p>Values, policies and action.</p> <p>Who knows? If we follow this with passion as well as discipline, people might just listen.</p>",
  "<p>Writers, if any good, should lead boring lives. Interventions on the great issues of the day can only be justified as a bit of light relief in order to escape the daily wrestle with words and meanings. It was a very bad moment when Johnson declared that the poet should write as \"the legislator of mankind\". That is the road that leads to the dull decency of the writers' conference. </p> <p>But there are some great authors who make such a fuss about their views and their actions that their work needs to be judged in relation to their lives. This is especially true of the, largely class-privileged, generation that grew up in the inter-war period and came to delight in the solemnity of commitment and the signing of the manifesto. This was only partly a question of responding to the Janus-headed rise of fascism and communism. This was the first literary generation to capitalise on the death of Christianity and seize the chance to ascend into a secular pulpit in order to instruct. Hence such wonderfully un-selfconscious moments of comedy as Wystan Auden's judgment that \"About suffering they were never wrong,/ The Old Masters\". Auden intimates that, after some pretty rough experiences in that department of life, he can offer a judgment. But the literary master, once away from his desk, mostly concentrated on how to mix the best dry martini in Manhattan. His was a voyeur's view of suffering. </p> <p>The division between life and work is not so easily made in the case of Graham Greene, who was born a century ago last Saturday. He never tired of quoting Browning on how \"Our interest's on the dangerous edge of things\" - the pretext for a lifetime's thrill in empathetic experiences, often on newspaper expenses, from Mexico in the 30s to south-east Asia in the 60s. And that easy embrace of us all into his, and Browning's, first person plural showed a very interwar prejudice in favour of collective action. Greene is the literary exploiter of the collapse of liberal individualism. </p> <p>Browning's \"honest thief, the tender murderer,/ The superstitious atheist\" populate Greene-land. It is a place that obeys the first rule of great art: the need to create a terrain that is faithful to its own imperatives and is wholly unlike any other possible place. And that world's population of the squalid, the crooked and the fugitive live on because they question all the boring old simplicities about reason, virtue and progress. The 19th-century liberalism that Greene helped to kick into touch had said that reform was obvious: have a cute thought, persuade others of its truth, and then implement it. But in literary terms, he showed how motives are always mixed, how the good can be damned and the wicked end up blessed. Life, happily, sucks. </p> <p> Behind all this joy in the defeat of good intent lay Catholicism - or rather Greene's attraction to an antinomian theology that claims that the more you sin the greater your consequent, repentant bliss. It's unlikely that his acidulated self ever believed in God - but the Catholic doctrine of grace became for Greene a useful bag of literary tricks and explains his use of the ambiguous motive in fiction. </p> <p>Not since Dickens had such a distinctive series of characters leaped from the pages of the English novel. Greene's contemporary Evelyn Waugh was the more fastidious stylist. Behind both writers there is the hand of God used as a literary device, manipulating and undercutting human assumptions to its own purpose. But Waugh's exquisite aestheticism also meant that his characters are often puppets who are merely incidental to the patterning of words and plot. Which is why they so often end up dead or discarded, having been sacrificed to the imposition of an aesthetic order. But Greene's Scobie and Pinkie, like Mrs Gamp and Pecksniff, have that authentic quality of cross-grained humanity that escapes a book's confines. </p> <p>That disillusioned stance of his also led to some cruelly bleak characterisation. Ida, the blowsy, cheerful drunk in Brighton Rock, is mocked because she represents the idea that goodness is somehow basic to human nature. This for Greene was the ethical religion of the English - a decadent liberal Protestantism sliding into secular do-gooding agnosticism. </p> <p>His life contained few real dangers. What Manhattan was to Auden, Antibes was to Greene - a place of writerly refuge from which to judge an England he disliked but couldn't really escape from. His delight in kicking against the traces was childlike, as was seen in Greene's friendship with that other spoilt bourgeois Kim Philby. Catholicism and spying were both reactive games played by two boys who were disappointed by the narrowing horizons of an England on the slide. </p> <p>But Greene transcends the petulance of some of his contemporaries. It is his art and not his life that shows the real taste for danger. For it confronts, and continually affronts, that persistent liberal-minded English belief that truth and decency are always obvious to those endowed with a rational and optimistic goodwill. For this necessary subversion of innocence he deserves more than just a centennial salute. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:taliesin.hywel@virgin.net\">taliesin.hywel@virgin.net</a></p>",

  "A Conservative push to the right, led by John Redwood, appeared to pay dividends last night with the news that the UK Independence party's biggest financial supporter was turning his back on the party. <p>Paul Sykes, the self-made Yorshireman passionately opposed to Europe, said last night he would no longer bankroll Ukip because it had decided to humiliate the Tories at the next election by fielding candidates who could unseat Eurosceptic MPs. </p> <p>Leading Tories, including Mr Redwood, have been holding secret talks with Mr Sykes for weeks. </p> <p>Mr Redwood yesterday called on Eurosceptics to desert Ukip and attacked their most high-profile activist, former Labour MP Robert Kilroy-Silk. </p> <p>\"His objective is not to rescue this country from Brussels,\" he told a fringe meeting. \"His objective is to kill the Tory party. Once a Labour MP, always a Labour MP.\" </p> <p>Mr Sykes said that despite his friendship with Mr Kilroy-Silk the party had \"blown it\" by deciding to attempt to kill off the Conservatives. </p> <p>Mr Sykes, a property developer who made his fortune exporting second-hand buses and lorries, had been a strong supporter of Mr Kilroy-Silk's ambitions to lead Ukip. But the former TV presenter's attack on the Tories at the weekend, combined with the overtures of Mr Redwood, appear to have persuaded him back into the Tory fold. </p> <p>However, asked if he would be rejoining the Tories, the multi-millionaire told the Daily Telegraph: \"Not yet\". </p> <p>Mr Redwood earlier identified Europe \"above all\" as an election issue, but was twice slapped down by his fellow shadow cabinet member, David Cameron, now in charge of policy, who said the party needed to concentrate on issues preoccupying people \"in pubs and clubs\" and not \"wild forays into different areas\". </p> <p>Mr Redwood said it was \"naive and dishonest to say you can simply pull out of the European Union,\" and urged partial withdrawal. \"Above all, we are going to win by telling the people the truth on Brussels and Europe. We have the right policy on that.\" </p> <p>But Mr Cameron countered: \"We won't win by picking one subject - whether it is Europe or anything else.\" </p> <p>At a conference fringe meeting, organised by the Times, David Davis, shadow home secretary, predicted that Ukip could win 30 to 50 seats. </p> <p>\"There is no lurch to the right in the Conservative party, but there may be a shift in public issues that people care about\", notably crime and immigration. \"We must get the country to buy its conservatism from the Conservatives,\" he said. </p> <p>\"People want their political parties to tackle the broad range of issues that they care about ... schools, hospitals, crime, immigration and tax.\"</p>",

  "<b> East Cheshire Hills</b> <p>The white helicopter came low over the russet moor close to Buxtors Hill, swooping low along Wildboarclough to land daintily on the lawn in front of Crag Hall. From Shutlingsloe's conical summit we used binoculars to see the butler come down the steps from the house and carry suitcases to the aircraft. The sun shone across the dale, highlighting the busky moors about the head of Cumberland Clough. </p> <p>Turning through 180 degrees we had a magnificent view. Far away in the south-west were the unmistakable profiles of Titterstone Clee, Brown Clee and the Wrekin. Beyond that rose the blue-grey block of the Breidden Hills straddling the Welsh border. Somewhat closer the backbone of Peckforton Hill rose in front of the distant bulk of the Clwydian Hills. Just to the right the little blue upthrust of castle-topped Beeston Tor appeared as a sentinel guarding the Cheshire Plain. The shining waters of the Mersey estuary helped us to locate the bold, 331ft tower of Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral on the north-western horizon, easily visible with the naked eye. Not so clear was the mast upon the summit of Winter Hill, beyond Bolton and flirting with south Pennine vapours. </p> <p>Below us to the west the crumpled country lay green and russet and criss-crossed with a fretwork of shadows. The flagged path leading to the edge of Macclesfield Forest makes the traverse of the soggy moor much easier these days, and as we went along a curlew skimmed over the heather close by. It would, no doubt, soon be packing its bags for seaside overwintering in the Dee or Ribble estuaries, its mournful song but a memory up here until next spring.</p>",
  "Israeli forces have demolished the homes of hundreds of Palestinians, bulldozed swaths of agricultural land and destroyed infrastructure in their bloodiest assault on the Gaza Strip in years. <p>More than 70 people have died in Operation Days of Penitence, launched in northern Gaza six days ago after a Hamas rocket attack killed two Israeli children. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said that the dead included 31 civilians. Nineteen were under 18. </p> <p>Most of the nine people killed yesterday were Palestinian fighters, but a teenage girl was among the dead, shot in her home. In southern Gaza Israeli forces killed a four-year-old boy in Khan Yunis refugee camp, where several Palestinian children have been shot dead in recent weeks. </p> <p>Last night the Israeli army said it had killed a Palestinian gunman who had tried to infiltrate a nearby settlement. Early today an Israeli missile strike in Jabaliya killed one Palestinian militant and wounded two others. </p> <p>But shielded from view is the suffering of about 50,000 Palestinians trapped in areas seized by hundreds of Israeli troops, backed by about 200 tanks and armoured vehicles. </p> <p>Palestinians in the Israeli-held areas, including parts of Jabaliya refugee camp and the small town of Beit Hanoun, described by telephone the widespread destruction and desperate living conditions. </p> <p>Armoured bulldozers had demolished scores, possibly hundreds, of homes, they said. Thousands of people had spent days without electricity and water, although power was restored sporadically yesterday. Residents said that the destruction of sewage systems had contaminated the water supplies in some areas. </p> <p>\"I can hear shooting now,\" said Hanna Basyouni, 35, who has seven children, speaking from an occupied section of Jabaliya. \"I see the tanks below me. The tanks and the bulldozers are 50 metres away from my home. I can see them shooting right now.\" </p> <p>Mrs Basyouni lives on the edge of Jabaliya where, she said, the Israeli army had bulldozed greenhouses that had been families' only source of income for several generations. </p> <p>The Israeli military says it is clearing a six-mile-wide buffer zone to stop Hamas launching rockets across the border. But yesterday the Islamist group fired two missiles into Israel. \"There's not one tree left for as far as I can see,\" said Mrs Basyouni. \"Five or six homes around me are completely bulldozed, and I can't be sure how many beyond that. My sister's home was destroyed ... [She] is living in a tent. She has nine children.\" </p> <p>Ambulance drivers, the only Palestinians permitted to cross into the occupied areas, confirmed the scale of the destruction. Abid Ahmed Abu Mohammed, a driver for Kamal Odwan hospital, said: \"We saw at least 50 houses bulldozed on the edge of Jabaliya and many inside the camp. </p> <p>\"I think most of the bulldozing was to make way for the tanks. There are main roads but the Israelis were afraid to use them because of mines. The bulldozers ... destroyed whatever was in their way - entire streets.\" </p> <p>The Israeli army said it had destroyed or damaged a \"small number\" of homes, either because its soldiers had been attacked or to allow its tanks to avoid booby-trapped roads. </p> <p>Many people are without water in Beit Hanoun, a town of 15,000 near the border with Israel. Aref Azaneed, a ministry of agriculture inspector, said: \"The water and the sewage lines are near each other. When the tanks destroy them, they mix. The water from the tap has sewage in it.\" </p> <p>Over the past three years the army has levelled 60% of Beit Hanoun's agricultural land, destroying its wealth and the main source of citrus fruit and olives in the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>\"Nobody comes in, nobody goes out,\" Mr Azaneed said. \"We can only move inside Beit Hanoun, and in a very careful way. There are about 40 tanks about 30 metres from houses close to Salahadin Road.\" </p> <p>A UN official said yesterday Israel had wrongly accused Hamas militants of using a UN ambulance to carry rockets, while Israeli officials renewed accusations that Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, was harbouring terrorists, the Associated Press reported. </p> <p>Israel has demanded the UN investigate the actions of Peter Hansen, its top official in Gaza, after its army released video footage from an unmanned aircraft that reportedly showed militants loading a rocket into a UN vehicle in Gaza. </p> <p>The UN says the footage shows a worker loading a stretcher into the vehicle. On Monday Mr Hansen wrote to the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, accusing Israel of inventing the story.</p>",
  "<p><strong>MasterCard and Visa lose appeal</strong></p> <p>The US supreme court yesterday rejected appeals by Visa and MasterCard against a ruling that their credit card associations violated federal antitrust law by barring their member banks from issuing credit and charge cards on the rival American Express and Discover Card networks. </p> <p>Lawyers for MasterCard said the ruling \"will undermine the incentives for vigorous competition\". </p> <p><strong>First Milk wises up</strong></p> <p>Farmers' cooperative First Milk is in talks to buy a 15% stake in dairy firm Robert Wiseman for \u00a328m as suppliers seek better prices by forging links with dairies. Wiseman, which supplies milk to Tesco, said the deal was likely to involve a tender offer for 15% of the company's shares at 250p a share, a 10% premium to last week's closing price. First Milk has more than 4,000 dairy farmer members producing 2.5bn litres a year - more than 20% of Britain's milk production. </p> <p><strong>Mandelson backs Airbus</strong></p> <p>Incoming European Union trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said yesterday he was confident the EU would have a strong counter-case if the United States brought a claim to the World Trade Organisation over aircraft subsidies. \"If the worst comes to the worst and the case is taken to the WTO, I am very confident indeed of the EU's position,\" he told a news conference. </p> <p>The two sides are in talks about revising an agreement over state aid to Boeing and Airbus. The US has threatened that it will go to the WTO if loans to Airbus by European governments are not stopped.</p> <p><strong>Ryanair sells off 20 old planes</strong></p> <p>Ryanair has struck a deal to sell its 20 ageing Boeing 737-200 aircraft to US firm, Autodirect Aviation, for $10m (\u00a35.6m). </p> <p>The aircraft date back to the 1980s and Ryanair has been replacing them with modern Boeing 737-800s, which seat more passengers. </p> <p><strong>Purer water targets set</strong></p> <p>The government has set water companies fresh targets for improving drinking water quality and environmental protection. It wants more work on reducing the volume of drinking water that is discoloured or has an \"unsatisfactory\" taste or smell. </p> <p>The proposals, which will form part of water industry regulator Ofwat's latest round of price-setting due in December, are likely to add about \u00a31 to customers' water bills by 2009. </p> <p><strong>AIG facing more charges</strong></p> <p>American International Group said yesterday that US regulators may file civil charges accusing it of issuing false and misleading statements to investors. </p> <p>The world's largest insurer by market value already faces possible securities and exchange commission civil charges and a justice department criminal probe into whether a subsidiary helped PNC Financial Services Group move $762m (\u00a3423m) of bad loans off its books, inflating the Pittsburgh-based bank's profit by $155m. </p> <p><strong>Balfour scoops US contracts</strong></p> <p>Balfour Beatty, the construction and engineering services group, said yesterday that it had won six civil engineering contracts in America, which are worth about $480m (\u00a3267m).</p> <p><strong>Durlacher chief quits</strong></p> <p>Christopher Stainforth has quit as chief executive of stockbroker Durlacher. Investors in the firm are thought to have expressed concerns over its cost base. Mr Stainforth, a well-known corporate financier who was acquitted of deception charges in the Blue Arrow trial of the early 90s, had joined the firm in 2002 to help its recovery following the bursting of the dotcom bubble. He will be replaced by Simon Hirst, head of corporate finance.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Daily Mirror </strong><br> Editorial, October 4 </p> <p> \"The Tory party is dying because it is almost entirely inhabited by people ... who are narrow-minded, unrepresentative and uncaring. They haven't got a clue about solving the problems of Britain because they are not interested in ordinary people and their problems. </p> <p>\"They are bundles of hate - they loathe Tony Blair, Labour, the unions, workers, the European Union, foreigners and people they call scroungers. Their ambition is to slash taxes for the rich. The real scroungers. This week in Bournemouth they will be navel-gazing while trying to work out where they are going wrong. If they lived in the real world, they would know.\" </p> <p><strong> Trevor Kavanagh </strong><br> Sun, October 4  </p> <p> \"The Tories start their conference ... desperately sick - and tired. Leading lights in the party are crippled by life-threatening anaemia, loss of appetite and delusions of grandeur. Troops have been laid low by the Ukip superbug, which devastated the Hartlepool byelection and threatens to spread its spores nationwide ... </p> <p>\"In recent weeks the Tories have come up with good policies on illegal immigration, crime and political correctness ... [But] the party that picked Britain up by the scruff of its neck under Margaret Thatcher is on its knees - just when the country needs a robust opposition.\" </p> <p><strong> Financial Times </strong><br> Editorial, October 4  </p> <p> \"Only an insane optimist would predict a Tory victory in the general election expected next year. It would take an improbable swing to destroy Labour's 159-seat majority at a single go ... Instead, Tories must begin to build a platform for success in 2009 - starting with deciding what they stand for. </p> <p>\"Its core principle should be a smaller state, with less regulation and lower taxes ... When the economy eventually turns down - as it must, pace Gordon Brown's abolition of boom and bust - the cost will become apparent in much bigger tax rises. A Conservative opposition that had consistently campaigned on an alternative approach even when it seemed unnecessary would be well placed to benefit.\" </p> <p><strong> Simon Heffer </strong><br> Daily Mail, October 4 </p> <p> \"The public simply don't know what the Tories stand for. With a general election campaign perhaps due to get under way in six months' time, that is staggering ... </p> <p>\"Michael Howard needs to take a grip and follow his own instincts rather than those of a clique of out-of-touch, predominantly young and metropolitan advisers. These people have advised him to ignore the party's core vote and appeal to middle-of-the-road voters. As a result, the core vote now votes Ukip, if it votes at all. The party's flawed strategy of avoiding issues such as immigration that might make it appear 'nasty' or uncaring has shut it off from the mainstream concerns of most of the electorate.\" </p> <p><strong> David Mellor </strong><br> Evening Standard, London, October 4 </p> <p> \"Voters ... see a party infirm of purpose, that doesn't believe in itself, and can therefore hardly expect anyone else to do so ... [The Conservatives] do not look like a party of government ... </p> <p>\"The Tories will best serve their own interests, and those of the nation, by being tough, and setting out a firm rightwing agenda that will offer the voters a genuine choice next spring. Like most people, Mr Howard is a composite: part tough-minded rightwinger, part emollient lawyer. The emollient lawyer will never win an election. Nor necessarily would the hard-nosed Thatcherite - but at least it's worth a try.\" </p> <p><strong> Tim Hames </strong><br> Times, October 4 </p> <p> \"The challenge for the Conservative party now, as it has been for seven years (arguably longer), is not really to do with the details of policy. It is instead to submit itself to a personality transplant ... [They] appear to think that if you can shout loudly enough in your own language then others will understand what you want and behave as you would wish them. In truth, the party will remain unelectable until it learns how to conduct a conversation with the country, employing a more emollient vocabulary ... </p> <p>\"This is not the conference when those in the Conservative party who favour market economics, social liberalism and an internationalist outlook abroad have to force themselves to ask awkward and searching questions. They are perfectly entitled to one last heave. In 12 months' time, none the less, they may have no option but to be deeply introspective.\" </p> <p><strong> Daily Telegraph </strong><br> Editorial, October 4 </p> <p> \"As the Tories gather in Bournemouth, the air is thick with advice. Every know-it-all thinks he has some quick fix to their problems. Some want a change in policies, others in personnel, others in presentation ... </p> <p>\"Mr Howard ... may be that rarest of politicians: one who delivers more in government than he promises in opposition. The voters, though, do not see any of this ... Activists and candidates, fretful about the coming general election, understandably want a quick fix. But there isn't one. If there were, the Tories would have found it by now. The best Mr Howard can do is patiently to convince the electorate that he and his party mean what they say: that they have a genuine vision of how Britain ought to be, and carefully measured policies to get us there.\"</p>",
  "As Tory activists sipped afternoon tea outside the conference hall yesterday, they were greeted by a familiar figure. Iain Duncan Smith, who had suffered an agonising defenestration only a year ago at the party conference, was now hailed with warm smiles and effusive handshakes as he walked through the crowd with his wife Betsy. <p>\"Bring back Duncan Smith,\" muttered one Tory. \"He was the best of the bunch because at least he knew where we had to be - on the middle ground banging on about core public services.\" </p> <p>In a sign of the gloom at senior levels of the Tory party, the supportive remarks came from an MP who had rejoiced at his downfall just a year ago. \"There is real concern,\" declared one Tory who predicted that Labour is on course for a majority of \"100ish\" at next year's general election. \"We are simply no match for the Blair propaganda machine. There is profound despair at the carpeting shadow ministers get every day.\" </p> <p>Such grim thoughts are rarely expressed in public and certainly not in the presence of grassroots Tories who were determined to remain upbeat yesterday. In the bars and cafes of Bournemouth the mainly elderly activists are attending one conference where MPs boost their spirits with rousing speeches of how the party is on a roll. </p> <p>As darkness falls on the Dorset resort - and the foot soldiers head for bed - a second conference takes place where MPs and shadow ministers voice their real thoughts in private. Loyal activists would be horrified by the mutterings which they believe are concocted by the media, which is blamed for most of the party's ills. </p> <p>Stuart Sexton, a loyal servant of the party in Croydon South, spoke for many when he said: \"I saw a BBC journalist who arrived in Bournemouth and immediately said the mood was depressed at our conference. I shouted at my television set and said how could she know that when she's just arrived. All I can say is that I am detecting a very positive attitude.\" </p> <p>His upbeat assessment was shared by Elaine Adams, deputy chairperson of the Shrewsbury and Atcham association, who believes that the tide is finally turning. \"I am very positive,\" Mrs Adams said of the battle in her constituency, which was a rock solid safe Tory seat until 1997. \"We really are starting to turn people round. This time four years ago people were reasonably sanguine about the Labour government. Now I am finding on the doorstep that people are really disappointed. We never really got our message across because of the leadership problems. But we have now resolved that.\" </p> <p>Even young Tory activists were talking up the party's prospects. Sam Beaver, 19, of the Conservative Future group, said: \"We are having a hard time in the press. But when we go out campaigning we get a very positive response. Conservative Future is the fastest growing political movement in the country.\" </p> <p>The buoyant activists found their mood improved in mid morning yesterday when Liam Fox, the Tory co-chairman, treated them to a speech which would not have appeared out of place at the height of William Hague's \"core votes strategy\" in the run up to the last general election. </p> <p>Dismissing criticism that Mr Howard has lurched to the right, Dr Fox won loud cheers as he pledged to tackle immigration and resist a European superstate, and talked up tax cuts. \"These are the buttons which get the hall roaring,\" one disgruntled MP said. \"There is no evidence that these are the buttons that will get the country roaring.\" </p> <p>Such remarks gave a taste of the battle raging on the fringes as Mr Howard embraces what one MP described as a \"core votes strategy lite\" in response to Ukip. Sceptics believe this is guaranteed to turn off voters on the centre ground. </p> <p>Nicholas Boles, head of the Portillo Policy Exchange thinktank, who is contesting the marginal seat of Hove, thought the leadership has achieved the right balance. \"We're not tacking in the direction of Ukip,\" he said. \"Robert Kilroy-Silk did us a favour by showing his true colours when he said he wants to kill us.\" </p> <p>Mr Boles, who is tiring of the \"moderniser\" tag always attached to his name, offered a candid assessment of the Tories. \"People fell out of love with us in the 1990s for good reason,\" he said. \"They then fell in love with Tony Blair in a way that no politician has ever experienced before. It was a partnership of passion which has gone sour. Because of the emotions involved people have fallen completely out of love with the entire political system as they turn their back on Blair.\" </p> <p>This presents a formidable challenge for Mr Howard. \"People are fed up with the high flown vision thing. This means that there can be no soaring rhetoric from Michael and only modest commitments. We need to treat people like grown ups.\"</p>",
  "The way other European countries deal with suspected international terrorists was examined by the Home Office when Britain's anti-terrorism law was drafted after September 11 2001. <p><b>France</b> Since the 1980s has had an offence of \"associating with a wrongdoer\", used to detain and prosecute terrorist suspects. It allows a specialist judge to order the indefinite detention of a suspect before prosecution. It is much more widely drawn than the English conspiracy law and has been used for more prosecutions. Unlike Britain, France will deport suspected terrorists to Algeria, Jordan and Egypt, but not if they would face a death sentence. </p> <p><b>Germany</b> Has strengthened its anti-terrorism law since September 11, but unlike the UK has a general offence of terrorism, which includes criminal prosecution of those who support a terrorist organisation. Terrorist cases can be held in secret if state security interests are at risk. </p> <p>Suspected terrorists who apply for asylum can be restricted in their movements by issuing them with a \"geographically restricted identity card\" so the security services can keep them under surveillance. </p> <p><b>Norway</b> has banned terrorism suspects from claiming asylum. </p> <p><b>Sweden</b> has extradited two people who were denied refugee status to Egypt, to face trial on terrorist charges after assurances they would not face the death sentence. </p>",
  "<p>October is black history month. The occasion has become a key part of the academic calendar, providing opportunities for fascinating work across the curriculum capable of broadening pupils' sense of themselves and of the past. Across the country, special black history events and exhibitions are planned and there are some exceptional resources online.</p> <p>Ask your pupils what comes to mind when they think of Tudor times. However great their knowledge, it is unlikely that many of them will have heard of John Blanke - the first recorded black Londoner - but exist he did, enjoying a prominent role among the court musicians of both Henry VII and VIII. His image is thought to have survived on a 60-foot painted roll depicting a lavish tournament of 1511 in Westminster, which celebrated Catherine of Aragon giving birth to a (short-lived) royal heir. Students can view the image and read about him on the National Archive's Black Presence website (<a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/early_times/blanke.htm\"> www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/early_times/blanke.htm</a>).</p> <p>In the same period, there were also black men and women at the court of James IV of Scotland. Long before them there had been black legions in the north. The emperor Septimus Severus was born in Libya (Leptis Magna) and ended his days in York (Eboracum) in AD 211. There are details about him and far more besides at the National Archive site, all of which can be used as the basis of assemblies, displays, talks and discussions.</p> <p><strong>Black history only in October?</strong></p> <p>This would make an interesting topic for discussion among students in history, English and citizenship lessons. It is one that exercises history teachers, too, many of whom feel it is a shame that there is a need for a black history month at all. They argue that the part played by black and Asian people in world history should feature naturally across the curriculum all year.</p> <p>A good place to join the debate and gather ideas for classroom discussion might be the forum at <a href=\"http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?show topic=1894&amp;st=0\"> http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?show topic=1894&amp;st=0</a>. Alternatively, visit Dan Lyden's online seminar at <a href=\"http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=1518\">www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=1518</a>.</p> <p><strong>Does black history matter?</strong></p> <p>It is essential that all children gain a sense of the past that is as sophisticated as possible and does not always come back to certain standard received ideas. The history of black Britons is far broader than the slave trade and the arrival of the Windrush, and Commonwealth citizens seeking new opportunity in the \"mother country\" in the late 1940s - however central these events were.</p> <p>Ask students why a focus on black history that emphasised only these elements might be partial. The part played by every race in the creation and maintenance of the British empire in peace and war is an answer, and can be developed via links at Runnymede Trust's site (<a href=\"http://www.realhistories.org.uk\">http://www.realhistories.org.uk</a>).</p> <p>Nor is the story of immigration into Britain a recent or West Indian monopoly, as students can discover through research in libraries and online. Encourage them to search the main black history month site (<a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/ history/index.html\">http://www.irr.org.uk/history/index.html</a>) or the Moving Here site (<a href=\"http://www.movinghere.org.uk\">www.movinghere.org.uk</a>). The latter is a vast resource, with a teachers' page, of freely downloadable community contributions - from personal thoughts to family photographs. Topics include music and art.</p> <p><strong>Famous black and Asian Britons</strong></p> <p>A principal element of black history month last year was the appeal for nominations for the top 100 black Britons. The fact that the official exercise is over does not preclude running the same kind of event in schools this year, using the brief autobiographies at the project's site (<a href=\"http://www.100greatblackbritons.com/list.html\">www.100greatblackbritons.com/list.html</a>).</p> <p>Put students in groups to research the entire database and come up with their nomination for the greatest black Briton, whom they can then argue for in class. A more targeted approach for younger pupils might involve celebrating the lives of those people who emerged in the top 10, including Mary Seacole, Olaudah Equiano or Queen Philippa of Hainault.</p> <p>The fact that the full nomination list sprang from every walk of life and profession means no department in the school need miss out on highlighting a key black individual. For more on Mary Seacole see a recent Guardian Unlimited article at <a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/review/story/0,,1147393,00.html\">http://books.theguardian.com/review/story/0,,1147393,00.html</a>. This could be offered to older students to boil down to form the basis of a letter to the librarian or headteacher asking for permission to put up a display about her in the library or school entrance hall. </p> <p><strong>Black history - not just in London</strong></p> <p>Of course, there have been prominent black and Asian populations in cities all over the UK (some for centuries) and no study of this topic should ignore that fact. The National Archive site provides a series of virtual tours of Bristol and Liverpool, as well as London. There are also tons of resources at the following museum sites in Liverpool (<a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/hamlyn/blackhistory/index.asp\"> http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/hamlyn/blackhistory/index.asp</a>), Birmingham (<a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ ITEM_ID=45015&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=126\">www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ ITEM_ID=45015&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=126</a>) and Bristol (<a href=\"http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/events.htm#bhm\">www.empiremuseum.co.uk/events.htm#bhm</a>).</p> <p>Another key point of departure for all manner of research is the National Maritime Museum, which for the past 18 months has been involved with the new Understanding Slavery Initiative. See <a href=\"http://www.nmm.ac.uk/site/request/setTemplate:singlecontent/contentTypeA/conWebDoc/contentId/16093\">www.nmm.ac.uk/site/request/setTemplate:singlecontent/contentTypeA/conWebDoc/contentId/16093</a>.</p> <p>Slavery remains a global problem. To bring the topic up to date, refer students to this Guardian article as the basis for a school campaign or class investigation of the issue (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1289222,00.html\">www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1289222,00.html</a>).</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links and guidance</strong></p> <p><strong>This lesson is written for KS3 (age 11-14) but can be adapted for other ages</strong></p> <p><strong>Key Stage 2 (age 7-11)</strong><br> Begin with an art project based on the portrait of Sir Henry Unton at the National Portrait Gallery (see <a href=\"http://www.mape.org.uk/activities/unton\">www.mape.org.uk/activities/unton</a>). Use it as a model to capture the life history of a black or Asian figure from the past.</p> <p>Ask students to investigate heraldry at the College of Arms (<a href=\"http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/01.htm\">www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/01.htm</a>) and then create their own arms designs for one or more of the great black Britons.</p> <p>Black history month emphasises local and personal history. If yours is an ethnically diverse school, celebrate the rich cultural roots of your pupils and the histories of the countries from which they and their families originally hail. Ask them to record their local and family history work using digital cameras, digital video or tape recordings.</p> <p><strong>Key Stage 4 (age 14-16)</strong><br> Black history and the British empire have played a major part in the development of the English language. Investigate the history and evolution of words. Bill Bryson's book Mother Tongue is an excellent resource.</p> <p>If you are still considering a Shakespeare play to study at GCSE, why not choose Othello? Discuss the representation of the Moor of Venice and the almost casual racism of Iago. Does the play undermine prejudice by making Othello a figure of tragic power or does his fateful end seem to reinforce certain stereotypes?</p> <p>In art, study black people in paintings and art (see <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/society_culture/multicultural/ black_britons_01.shtml\"> http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/society_culture/multicultural/black_britons_01.shtml</a>). Look at the images of William Hogarth, such as Mariage \u00e0 la mode (<a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/loadApplet?workNumber=NG116&amp;collectionSection=work\">http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/ CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/loadApplet?workNumber=NG116&amp;collectionSection=work</a>), where the black servant is clearly aware of the scandal brewing beside him.

  "Confusion surrounded the intentions of Eurosceptic millionaire Paul Sykes today after he announced his abandonment of the UK Independence party this morning before taking lunch with Robert Kilroy-Silk. <p>His apparent return to the Tory fold brought relief to the party, which fears being squeezed by Ukip at the general election, but also unease about a possible move to the right.</p> <p>The Yorkshire businessman, who contributed over half of Ukip's \u00a32m fighting fund for June's European elections, said that the party had \"blown it\" by deciding to field candidates against Eurosceptic Tory MPs.</p> <p>Mr Sykes' announcement was followed by a resolutely Eurosceptic speech by the Tory leader, Michael Howard, who appealed to Ukip voters to back the Conservatives' bid to \"bring power back from Brussels\".</p> <p>Despite Conservative briefings yesterday that Europe would not play a major part in Mr Howard's speech, it was central to his message of restoring accountability and trust to British politics.</p> <p> <b>Accusations of a deal</b></p> <p>Labour, meanwhile, reacted to the news by accusing the Tories of striking a deal with Mr Sykes, who is known to have met with the party's famously Eurosceptic deregulation spokesman, John Redwood.</p> <p>Cabinet Office minister Ruth Kelly said: \"This secret deal with the rightwing funder of Ukip shows that the Conservative party has not changed. </p> <p>\"They are still the same old Conservative party, still out of touch with the British people and still unable to reach out to voters in the centre ground.\" </p> <p>David Cameron, the Conservatives' policy chief, denied that a deal had been struck, telling Sky News that \"we are not going to do any deals with anybody\". </p> <p>\"What matters is doing the right thing for the country and taking back some of the powers from Brussels to make sure we have proper, good accountable government in Westminster,\" he added. </p> <p> <b>Abandoning Ukip</b></p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning Mr Sykes said that it was because of the choice between Labour and the \"only one major party now that is anti-Brussels, that is for repatriating powers\" that he had decided to stop funding Ukip.</p> <p>He added that he was \"warming\" to what he was hearing from the Conservative party, adding: \"I have no intention whatsoever of upsetting their applecart\".</p> <p>Former Tory leader William Hague was not convinced, however, by Mr Sykes' promise of good behaviour, cautioning against a hardening of the party's position on Europe in an attempt to woo back Ukip supporters who once voted Conservative.</p> <p>\"I think the thing to do is not to buy off people who are thinking of voting for Ukip by a change in policy,\" he told the programme.</p> <p><b>Tory dilemma</b></p> <p>The Conservatives have been agonising about how to see off Ukip, which threatens to take Tory votes in the party's most marginal constituencies, without alienating centrist floating voters.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, warned at a conference fringe meeting yesterday that Ukip could lose the party between 30 and 50 seats at the general election unless it is stopped.</p> <p>\"We must get the country to buy its conservatism from the Conservatives,\" he said, suggesting that the Tories should concentrate on traditional rightwing issues such as crime and immigration.</p> <p>Mr Redwood, meanwhile, identified Europe \"above all\" as an election issue at a fringe meeting attended by his cabinet colleague Mr Cameron.</p> <p>Mr Cameron dismissed his call and insisted that the Tories needed to concentrate on issues preoccupying people \"in pubs and clubs\" and not \"wild forays into different areas\".</p> <p><b>Ukip disunity</b></p> <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip's group of MEPs, today suggested that the decision to stand against all Tory MPs in the next general election may have been a misjudgment.</p> <p>\"The party went to its conference on Saturday in Bristol in euphoric mood.
