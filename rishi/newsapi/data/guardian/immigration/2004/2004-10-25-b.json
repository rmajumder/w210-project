  "It is a serious matter to vote down the entire incoming European commission, but it also a serious mistake of the EU member states and of the president-designate, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, to propose Rocco Buttiglione as a candidate for one of the most important jobs: commissioner for justice and civil liberties (Report, October 22). He is entirely unfitted to that role. <p>If, as I hope, a majority of MEPs, who are directly elected, joins me in voting down the commission tomorrow, we shall be doing our job of holding the executive to account and helping remedy the EU's much-deplored \"democratic deficit\" two days before signature of the new constitution. </p> <p>It is not just that Buttiglione has prejudices against gay people and women. He has also proved himself, as a member of the Berlusconi government, complicit in widespread non-respect for the rule of law. On asylum, the Italian government is breaching the UN refugee convention by deporting migrants without determining whether they qualify as refugees. It held up agreement on the European arrest warrant, which cuts red tape in getting criminal and terrorist suspects before the courts, and Italy is the only country that has not implemented it. And it has passed laws to pervert the Italian justice system and give Berlusconi and others immunity from fraud and corruption charges. </p> <p>Barroso last week proposed a complicated arrangement whereby he and other commissioners would carry out the fundamental-rights part of Buttiglione's duties. But the portfolio is indivisible, especially as counter-terrorism measures threaten civil liberties.<br> <b>Sarah Ludford MEP</b><br>Lib Dem, European justice spokeswoman</p>",
  "Israel has agreed to allow the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to leave his compound to receive medical treatment, Israeli media reported tonight. <p>The decision would permit Mr Arafat to leave his compound in Ramallah for the first time in two and a half years and receive attention at a nearby hospital in the city in the West Bank. </p> <p>There was some initial confusion about whether the Israelis would allow Mr Arafat to return to his compound, which has been heavily damaged by Israeli attacks over recent years. But the latest reports appeared to indicate that Israel would allow him to return as long as he stayed in the West Bank territory. </p> <p>There was no indication that Mr Arafat wanted to leave the West Bank city and Israel's move apparently followed a request by his aides for him to be treated locally. In the past, Israel has threatend not to allow him to return if he ever left the West Bank.</p> <p>Israel television reported that the defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, had given the permission for a hospital visit.</p> <p>Mr Arafat is recuperating from the flu. In recent days he had been seen by doctors from Egypt and Tunisia. He was seen in public yesterday and it was thought that Israeli officials may have been responding to a request from Mr Arafat's aides from several days ago when he was more ill. </p> <p>Earlier, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, opened a controversial parliamentary debate on the withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip, hours after a major Israeli army raid on the Khan Younis refugee camp today left 14 Palestinians dead and 72 wounded.</p> <p>\"This is a fateful hour for Israel. We are facing an unprecedented decision,\" Mr Sharon told the Knesset, as lawmakers opposed to his plan heckled him. \"I call on the people of Israel to unite in this fateful moment, to allow us ... to erect a dam against the hatred among us.\"</p> <p>He told the parliament the plan would lead to greater peace and strengthen the country. \"I'm convinced this disengagement will strengthen Israel and its hold on the territory vital for our existence,\" he said in reference to the West Bank, home to larger Jewish settlements.</p> <p>Outside, thousands of police were deployed to protect the parliament, after receiving an anonymous threat to kill Mr Sharon and fears over mass rallies for and against the controversial bill.</p> <p>On Sunday, the Israeli cabinet voted 13-6 to approve Mr Sharon's plan, which provides for compensation for about 8,800 settlers who are to be uprooted, with payments of up to \u00a3278,000 for settlers who are forced from their homes and jail terms for those who resist.</p> <p>The parliamentary debate is expected to be bitter, with about 18 of the Likud party's 40 MPs saying they intend to vote against the legislation, making it increasingly difficult for Mr Sharon to govern. Mr Sharon will rely on the support of the opposition Labour Party, lead by Shimon Peres, who has described the vote as one of the \"strangest in history\".</p> <p>\"The main opposition party in its entirety will support the prime minister's policy whereas the prime minister's party will split in the vote and about half the members will vote against the prime minister,\" he said.</p> <p>Religious figures have also expressed their disquiet over the bill, with the spiritual leader of the religious Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruling at the weekend that its MPs are obliged to vote against the plan.</p> <p>Violence has erupted in Gaza in the months since Mr Sharon announced his controversial withdrawal plan to start next year. </p> <p>In a major assault on the Khan Younis camp in southern Gaza, Israeli air strikes and tank fire killed 14 and wounded 72, according to doctors. Three members of the Palestinian security forces, a gunman and an 11-year-old schoolboy were among the dead.</p> <p>Two Israeli soldiers were injured when Palestinians fired an anti-tank missile.</p> <p>The army said the raid on the refugee camp was aimed at stopping militants from launching mortar attacks on nearby Israeli settlements. It also that it had demolished the home of a local Hamas leader who was responsible for the attacks that killed eight Israelis.</p> <p>The disengagement plan would mark the first time Israel pulled down Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza since capturing land in the 1967 war. </p>",
  "Tony Blair today defended EU plans to streamline decision-making on asylum and immigration, insisting that they would give Britain \"the best of both worlds\". <p>The prime minister was speaking to journalists at his monthly press conference, ahead of a summit of EU interior ministers set to agree to abolish the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy and replace it with a system of qualified majority voting (QMV).</p> <p>Mr Blair said: \"There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls.</p> <p>\"With the Treaty of Amsterdam seven years ago, we secured the absolute right to opt into any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe.</p> <p>\"Unless we opt in we are not affected by it. And what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds.</p> <p>\"We are not obliged to have any of the European rules here. But where we decide in a particular area, for example to halt the trafficking in people, for example to make sure that there are proper restrictions on some of the European borders that end up affecting our country, it allows us to opt in and take part in these measures.\"</p> <p>This morning, the shadow home secretary, David Davis, described the plan as being the thin end of the wedge on the way towards a common EU policy, and accused the home secretary, David Blunkett, of being \"gullible\" about the intentions of his European counterparts.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning: \"On this issue we are right to ensure that majority voting can get other countries to do what we want.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We do want to collaborate with border controls ... because people travel through Europe, not just asylum seekers but drug dealers and organised criminals. They travel to the UK through the rest of Europe. We need the rest of Europe to get its act together.</p> <p>Mr Davis, meanwhile, told Today: \"The problem here is that giving away the veto is frankly gullible.</p> <p>\"The answer to the failure on immigration and asylum is for the government to get a grip, not to give up powers to Europe. QMV may make decisions quicker, but it won't necessarily make them in the UK's interests.</p> <p>\"After all, for the last several years, a number of European countries have been perfectly happy for asylum seekers to pass through their country to come here against the normally accepted conventions. Why should they now be altruistic in a majority voting set-up?\"</p>",
  "<p>Sainsbury's Bank upped the stakes in the battle for credit card customers today by offering 0% finance on purchases for a year on its new standard and platinum Visa cards. </p> <p>The development is likely to worry debt counselling groups who fear card companies are making it too easy for people to run up bills they are unable to clear within the interest-free period. </p> <p>Sainsbury's cards, which provide consumers with the longest interest-free period available, also offer 0.25% cashback on the value of purchases or Nectar points. But balance transfers are not included in the deal and carry a rate of 5.9% if transfers are made in the first six months. </p> <p>Lucy Hunter, credit cards manager at Sainsbury's Bank, said: \"Our new cards are the first to offer a 12-month 0% period on purchases as well as cashback and discounts off shopping.\" </p> <p>The standard APR on purchases and balance transfers for the Sainsbury's Bank standard and platinum cards is 15.9%. </p> <p>Mike Naylor, principal credit card researcher at Which?, said on the face of it the cards were good news for consumers, as long as they were disciplined and did not borrow outside their means. </p> <p>\"If people understand how these cards work and don't get tempted into borrowing more than they can afford, then these cards are offering a good deal. </p> <p>\"However, there is always the risk that people will spend more than they had planned to, because for a period of time, it's 'free money'. But there's always a catch: in this case balance transfers are not interest-free, so this card is only really a good option for people using it to purchase items, and at the end of the 12 months the APR is 15.9%. </p> <p>Tomorrow MPs investigating the credit card industry will quiz bosses from Barclaycard, HSBC, MBNA and The Royal Bank of Scotland at a Treasury Select Committee. Last week the committee heard how a disabled man committed suicide after becoming trapped by credit card debt and other loans.</p>",
  "Tony Blair will inevitably face questions about Iraq and the controversial deployment of the Black Watch outside Baghdad at his press conference today. No change there then. But to stop things being too much like groundhog day, he should also be quizzed about the government's plans to sign up to new EU voting mechanisms for immigration policy and for gambling reform. <p><b>Midday</b><br> The prime minister begins proceedings by celebrating the government's record on fighting crime and promising to accelerate the criminal justice process. He announces that certain defendants' past criminal records will also be made known to juries. On Thursday the government will be publishing a report on anti-social behaviour orders, known as Asbos, while next month it will publish a white paper on policing.</p> <p><b>12.10pm</b><br> As usual, the BBC's political editor, Andy Marr, starts the questioning, asking about the expansion of casinos. The prime minister replies that 90% of the gambling bill is about improving and modernising regulation, particular to protect children. However, it will also include changes to the country's planning laws to bring in the \"regeneration\" of casino expansion. </p> <p>He says that the bill will only result in \"20 to 40\" new casinos, and adds that it will allow the government, for the first time, to regulate the industry in the proper way. He insists that it amounts to the \"tightening of regulation\".</p> <p><b>12.15pm</b><br> ITV's Nick Robinson asks about the government \"giving up\" the EU veto on Britain's border controls. Mr Blair disputes this, pointing out that Britain retains an \"opt-in\" to the legislation - allowing it to stay out of measures it does not like - and saying that we will have the \"best of both worlds\". </p> <p>He goes on to say that the introduction of qualified majority voting in immigration allows an improvement of controls across the continent.</p> <p><b>12.20pm</b><br> Asked about the Black Watch's deployment to aid US troops in Iraq, and whether it means the government endorses American action in Faluja, Mr Blair insists that the \"key issue\" is the Iraqi elections in January. If the Iraqis are allowed to elect their own government, that destroys the whole case of the insurgents, he says. He also states that Britain is undertaking a \"limited operation for a limited period\". </p> <p>We have to \"stay firm and see it through\", he concludes. </p> <p>The political editor of the Daily Express asks about Mr Blair's purchase of a multi-million pound house in London, and whether his purchase has been guaranteed by anyone. The prime minister says he has nothing to say other than what has already been said.</p> <p><b>12.25pm</b> Won't allowing juries to see past convictions just increase the number of people in prison? Mr Blair says that the government is trying to \"rebalance\" the criminal justice system to stop people \"playing the system\", seemingly conceding that prison numbers will rise.</p> <p>Mr Blair now has a bit of a bust-up with the Sun's Trevor Kavanagh about whether the government \"rolls over\" to Brussels. The Sun's man thinks it does, Mr Blair disagrees. The prime minister points out that the asylum \"opt-in\" has existed for seven years and hasn't been compromised in that time.</p> <p><b>12.30pm</b><br> Asked about the tax regime for new casinos, Mr Blair says that it's up to the Treasury and describes the Times story that the US gaming industry boss was promised a cut in tax as \"absolute nonsense\". </p> <p>The prime minister is now asked when he is going to start campaigning for a yes vote on the EU constitution which he is set to sign. He insists that he is \"campaigning now\" by talking to the press.</p> <p><b>12.35pm</b><br> Rob Hutton from Bloomburg asks about whether we can put pressure on the Iranians over their nuclear programme when we depend on their oil. The prime minister denies that that is a problem, saying that the government will continue to push the UN nuclear watchdog.</p> <p>He is then questioned on whether he would participate in a joint military action with the US against Iran or Syria. Mr Blair denies that there is any talk of such things and says that negotiations have not been exhausted.</p> <p><b>12.40pm</b><br> Mr Blair now denies that there was a failure of post-war planning in Iraq, arguing that fears about a large-scale humanitarian crisis or Kurdistan seceding have not materialised. What has happened, he adds, is that foreign terrorists have entered the country to stop the creation of a democracy which would undermine their efforts.</p> <p>These people can't be defeated by security measures alone, he says. The biggest blow of the last few months to them is the Afghan election, which shows what we are actually trying to do.</p> <p><b>12.45pm</b><br> The Telegraph's George Jones asks if the prime minister is happy with the way that MPs claim expenses. He replied that he is happy that they have been reported, seemingly not an answer to the question asked.</p> <p>Channel 4 News asks about the government's \"moral compass\" and why the government is intervening more in people's lives in some ways - over diet, hunting, etc - but less in other areas such as licensing and gambling laws. Where is the moral rationale? </p> <p>Mr Blair returns to the issue of the gambling bill, insisting that there is 24-hour gambling at the moment. There is a lot of misapprehension of what is happening here, he adds. </p> <p><b>12.55pm</b><br> The BBC's James Landale asks whether the prime minister thinks that gambling is a good thing or bad. Mr Blair replies that \"gambling goes on\" and that the issue is not whether it is right or not. He insists however that he is not a gambler. After laughter, he conceded that he may be in the political sense. </p> <p>The Times' Tom Baldwin asks if he can remembers anything he said to any of his colleagues that would give them any reason to think he may stand down. No I can't, Mr Blair replies. </p> <p><b>1pm</b><br> Mr Blair is then asked about the Northern Ireland secretary Paul Murphy's optimistic comments about restoring devolution in Ulster. He replied that the chance of a breakthrough is there because the issues now dividing the parties are now \"so well-defined\" and the recent talks at Leed Castle were undertaken in such good spirits. </p> <p>And that's it for another month.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. The Environmental IQ: profiling the impact of products </strong><br> This idea is a truly timely one: it proposes a scheme in which the impact (or 'footprint') of products on the world, in terms of sustainability, fairness and health, is provided for consumers to view. The product profiles could be accessible online, or the 'EIQ' could simply be put as a figure on the packaging; both systems would empower customers to make rounded, accurate ethical choices. So, fruit that is grown on deforested land, picked by seasonal workers with no rights, and which is transported for thousands of miles for sale would have a low IQ; which seems appropriate enough.</p> <p><strong>2. Hibernation Day: an international duvet day for the world</strong><br> There has been something of a laziness renaissance in the past few years, and we've covered research that says that idleness is the key to longer life, power-napping projects in schools and a campaign for greater slacking rights (which was predictably low-key and lethargic). This idea is very much in the same vein, although I like this one particularly for its sheer ambition: that around the world, \"no businesses, schools, restaurants or shopping areas would be permitted to open\" on the day. A little dogmatic for a chilled-out idea, perhaps, but who wouldn't be ready to join in?</p> <p><strong>3. Fame Lottery: people get their 15 minutes, money goes to charity</strong><br> In a world obsessed with celebrity and fame, what better way to raise money for charity than with the Fame Lottery? It works like this: the lottery is run by a non-profit organisation who take a percentage of the proceeds to support their work. People buy the tickets in the hope of being the lottery's spokesperson that month, which would involve spots on TV, radio and the internet. So the charity gets much-needed cash, and the lottery-winner gets their ego tickled with media appearances. And the saddest thing of all? It might just work.</p> <p><strong>4. A city/country house swap network to house everyone efficiently</strong><br> Just as one can see the hand of Big Brother in the Fame Lottery, so the spectre of countless property programmes looms over this idea. The problem is that many people are buying second homes in rural locations, inflating the prices beyond the means of the locals and leaving communities half-empty for much of the year. And the solution? A swap network of city and country houses, so city slickers could escape for the weekend, while those in rural areas come up to the big smoke for their own mini-break. No need to buy, no empty villages, and nary a mention of the dreaded words 'crash pad'.</p> <p><strong>5. Lottery entry slips to have a tick box for 10% to charity</strong><br> One of the simplest ideas in the book and one of the best. Put simply, each lottery ticket should have a tick box which says next to it \"If I win over \u00a3....., I will give 10% of my winnings to charity\". There could even be a space provided for the specific charity the person wants to give to. Obviously, clear terms and conditions would be needed, but the money could be dispensed by the lottery administrators direct to ensure it reached the intended organisation. Not only would this give an extra charitable angle to the current system, but it would also help change the wayward perception that all the lottery money goes to fund refugee groups/athletes/museums/football kits (delete as applicable).</p> <p><strong>6. A proportion of defence spending to tackle the causes of terrorism</strong><br> This is one of those 'if only' ideas that make so much sense but are, to the jaded world-watcher, thoroughly unlikely to happen. Essentially, it contends that 10% of G8 countries' defence spending should be diverted into a UN (or other) development programme. The programme would aim to address the economic, political, social and religious reasons behind terrorism: a different kind of pre-emptive action, and one that would surely have better results. The campaign starts here. Interestingly, our biggest ever influx of social inventions came after the events of September 11 (including the shortest ever idea submitted to us: \"Fight terrorism: fly naked\"), and people's ideas shone with positivity amongst the pervading gloom of that time. </p> <p><strong>7. Heavy parking fines (but only for persistent transgressors) </strong><br> Trebling or quadrupling parking fines is the idea here, but only for those who persistently cross the line (or both yellow ones). Alongside this, measures would be introduced so that drivers could claim back one parking fine when renewing their road tax. As a result, occasional transgressors would not be unduly punished, whereas those who constantly get tickets would have a substantial incentive to stop doing so. This might seem drastic, but not as excessive as the mayor of Ecatepec in Mexico, who recently abolished parking tickets altogether in an effort to reduce police corruption in the city.</p> <p><strong>8. Charging the candidates for political apathy</strong><br> We've had countless ideas submitted to encourage more people to vote: drive-through voting, free beer for voters, discounts in shops with polling cards, and even voting rights from birth. This one stands out because it combines the need to get a disillusioned public involved with our wish for politicians to become more accountable. Essentially, if the turnout is below a certain level (say, 60%), the election in that area would be re-run at the expense of the candidates involved who, in the words of our social inventor, \"have clearly failed miserably to motivate the voters\". Costs of the re-run would be proportional to the number of votes cast. A further suggestion, which could be implemented in tandem, is that every vote from someone under 23 should count double: that might also prove to be a substantial cat amongst some wildly flapping pigeons.</p> <p><strong>9. A focused eco-tax on using animals in product marketing</strong><br> A great piece of simple creative thinking in evidence here: companies who use animals in their marketing and promotion should have to contribute something to preserving or helping the animal in question. Esso would have to contribute to a tiger reserve, Andrex to a dogs home, PG Tips to chimpanzee welfare and so on. It needn't necessarily be a huge amount but seeing as the companies profit from using the animals, it seems fair to give something back, and it may even prove to be a useful marketing exercise for the companies involved.</p> <p><strong>10. Using cartoons to assess middle management problems</strong><br> The theory behind this idea is that if an employee has a Dilbert (or other) cartoon up on their wall or computer, then the organisation is likely to have the problem it details. In larger organisations, therefore, one could total up the number of such cartoons and come to a figure (total number of cartoons divided by number of employees) on what might be termed 'The Dilbert Scale'. This would give a completely unscientific, but quite amusing way of comparing middle management problems in various organisations. </p> <p> These social inventions came from: </p> <p>1.

  "Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat is pumped. Two weeks ago, sitting in an internet cafe on Munich's Odeonplatz, the software marketer who crafted a hugely successful voter registration website, pulls up numbers that show a remarkable spike in Americans overseas mobilising to defeat George W Bush. Between her site and another out of Hong Kong, Democrats have registered 140,000 new voters, 40% of them from swing states - and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Americans abroad, roused to a boiling fury by a Bush doctrine that has smeared America's good name across the globe, are looking like the \"silent swing vote\" in several key battleground states. Overseas registration for both parties is up by 400% over 2000; estimates put the tally of possible civilian votes as high as 2 million. <p>Then the panicked emails start flooding in. Today, less than two weeks before the tightest presidential race in memory, untold thousands of overseas voters still have not received their ballots - and clearly won't be able to get them back in time. Late primaries and legal challenges to Ralph Nader's appearance on the ballot delayed mailings from half the battleground states. In swing states, including Florida, Ohio and New Mexico, different versions of the ballot have gone out, sowing wild confusion. In Pennsylvania alone, at least three versions were mailed overseas, in successive, chaotic waves - with Nader and without him, plus a blank one-size-fits-all ballot with no names at all. </p> <p>Activists now fear that huge numbers of Americans overseas - both military and civilian - may be as disenfranchised as they were in 2000, when anywhere from 10 to 40% of overseas ballots, depending on the county, just plain never showed up. But, far from helping civilians, the Federal Voting Assistance Programme (FVAP) has dragged its feet. A small liaison office based in the Pentagon, the FVAP provides voting materials to the departments of defence and state for soldiers and civilians abroad, and preaches overseas election law to thousands of local election officials back home. </p> <p>The Government Accountability Office excoriated the agency for losing thousands of overseas votes in 2000, but the FVAP insists it has corrected its problems this year. Frustrated civilian advocates, however, say the FVAP remains biased and ineffective. Despite reforms, they attest, it still has not shaken its Pentagon roots: It spends the bulk of its energy getting out a heavily Republican vote among half a million service people - but has failed the far greater numbers of civilians (an estimated 4 million, by most counts) who tend to vote a different way. </p> <p>The tsunami of overseas civilian voters this year has only made the inequity more glaring. The agency was overwhelmed by a flood that has clogged its fax lines, telephones and email. It has blocked access to its website to civilian voters abroad, given military voters access to electronic ballot-request systems that civilians cannot use, and subcontracted sensitive election work to a company with strong Republican ties. For months, it failed to heed requests from the state department to post an emergency substitute ballot on its website that will mainly help civilians living far from consulates and military bases. Finally, on October 21, with only 12 days till the election, it will post a downloadable version of the federal write-in absentee ballot, known as FWAB: a last-ditch device intended for the precise situation in which thousands of overseas voters now find themselves. </p> <p>Those who've busted their guts to get out the overseas civilian vote on both sides are relieved but still angry. \"Considering 2000 and the fact everybody knew this was going to be a close race, they should have seen it coming,\" says Joan Hills, co-chair of Republicans Abroad. \"The obstacles that have been thrown up are incredible,\" says Jim Brenner, executive director of AOK (Americans Overseas for Kerry), an arm of the Democratic National Committee. Samuel F Wright, director of the Military Voting Rights Project of the National Defence Committee, and a Navy Reserve officer who has spent 25 years observing the FVAP, says: \"Frankly, I'm not impressed with them. They're sort of going through the motions. I've been pinging on DoD for four years that this is the perfect situation for the emergency ballot.\" Voters who have requested but not received their ballot by now can dispatch the FWAB in its place. (If the real ballot subsequently arrives, election officials are required to discard the FWAB and count the regular ballot.) </p> <p>A million hard copies of the FWAB have been sent to military bases in Germany and Asia and to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan - two for every member of the military, Wright says - who surely deserve them. But on the civilian side, the record is spottier. The state department, charged with helping civilians overseas, ordered its consulates and embassies to stockpile the form. But Democrats Abroad reports that many have been caught short-handed and that direct voter requests to the FVAP have gone unfulfilled. In one pathetic twist, employees of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart had to beg forms from the military at the gate of the base last week, a voting officer said. </p> <p>Because so much hangs on key states, and on the possibly widespread use of an untested, little-known ballot, the potential for disaster is enormous. \"If this election is close, 2000 is going to look like a cakewalk,\" says Margo Miller, a London-based lawyer for AOK. \"It's going to be so messy in so many places, the fact that the FWAB hasn't been easier to get is inexcusable.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon responds that the two major parties began asking for the online FWAB only in late September and that it has moved \"mountains of bureaucracy\" to get the form online. Starting now, the tiny bureau of 14 civil servants in suburban Virginia will get the word out to election officials in 3,142 American counties that the downloaded version of the write-in ballot is good to go. </p> <p>But the programme's record does not inspire much confidence. Indeed, voters contacting officials to ask about the ballot have been shocked at the ignorance they've encountered. In Nepal, one embassy worker said the ballot could be mailed from the United States, which it cannot; in Chester County, Pennsylvania, an election supervisor had no idea what it was. Says Wright of the Military Voting Rights Project: \"Nobody has ever heard of it. The FVAP does show up at meetings and presentations, but I bet a lot of the 5,000 election officials don't go to those meetings, judging from the very basic questions we get back.\" </p> <p>While waiting for the FVAP to act, both parties gyrated over the internet. AOK put up its own version online with the disclaimer that no one knew if such ballots would be accepted; Democrats Abroad and the two main registration websites did not. Republicans Abroad then snitched the AOK form, without the disclaimer, and put it on its site, only to shamefacedly pull it off when told that, until the FVAP formally approved it, nobody could use the darn thing. AOK finally sent out 25,000 hard copies at its own expense to voters from swing states who'd signed up on the Overseas Vote 2004 website. </p> <p>The overarching problem is the scant resources allotted civilian voters, who outnumber the military overseas by at least eight to one. While all applaud the goal of making sure men and women fighting for our country can exercise their right to vote, civilians point out that they are Americans, too. And the FVAP has a history of favouring the military, not least because the department of defence has a captive, easily identified audience and far more money and muscle than the state department. Citizens abroad are far harder to find than soldiers: Embassies have direct contact only with a small minority of those who have registered to be alerted and evacuated in case of a disaster - though one might call mass disenfranchisement a disaster of another degree. </p> <p>Highly publicised missteps this year have hardly restored faith in the FVAP. Civilian voters still have trouble getting through to the agency and are barred from the email ballot request-and-delivery website that is available to soldiers from ten states. More worryingly, a pilot email voting system signed on to by Missouri, Utah and North Dakota, in which soldiers can email ballots to a contractor that then faxes those ballots to local jurisdictions, is being operated by Omega Technologies, headed by a former Republican Party donor, according to the New York Times. </p> <p>The Times also reports that earlier this week two Democratic members of Congress, Henry Waxman of California and Carolyn B Maloney of New York, asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the FVAP. Among their concerns is that the agency's online ballot-retrieval system is not open to most civilians abroad. </p> <p>Miller, the AOK lawyer, says the FVAP, which moved only two years ago from the Pentagon department that buys soap and toilet paper into the personnel department, \"is basically focused on the military and doesn't care\". A department of defence insider involved in getting out the vote overseas puts it more harshly: \"The senior military leadership will only admit they have a responsibility to help civilians get involved in elections if you force it down their throat. They're only interested in the soldiers.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon denies these charges. As each misstep has occurred, deputy undersecretary of defence Charles Abell has defended the FVAP, saying it is making a heroic effort to reach all citizens overseas through voting workshops and toll-free telephone numbers. Indeed, all observers agree that the FVAP has gone to extraordinary lengths this year to get out the military vote. Still, Democrats suspect that in the case of the online ballot, it's no accident that the agency did not move faster: The measure mainly benefits civilians, many more of whom will support John Kerry than their counterparts in the military. </p> <p>Dzieduszycka-Suinat frets darkly that \"higher up, someone is saying: 'Make sure there are problems.'\" From the perspective of Wright, from the Military Voting Rights Project, political pressure is a given. \"When Clinton was in charge, they tried to suppress the military vote for that very reason,\" he says. \"I would not disagree,\" he says, that politics this year, too, plays a role. Faced with a voting programme that at best is ineffective, and at worst partisan, ordinary citizens have been forced to pick up the slack. Wright's organisation, for instance, blitzed the country's election offices with faxed alerts telling them how to process the write-in ballot. And it is thanks mainly to the efforts of two smart groups of expatriates that tens of thousands of new voters made it through the registration process at all. The FVAP distributed millions of registration postcards, but without help, the complex rules daunted many civilians. </p> <p>The state department, stretched thin by new visa regulations imposed after 9/11, has nowhere near the resources in its consulates to help citizens that the department of defence has deployed for its soldiers abroad, a high-ranking official said. Though it has done its best to walk civilians through the 369-page \"Black Book\" of state-by-state election rules, \"we literally don't have the staff to be able to do this,\" the official said. The upshot: There is a military voting assistance officer for every 30 to 50 soldiers, but the onus is on the civilian to fill out the form alone. </p> <p>Democrats Abroad thus began the campaign season camped at card tables on foreign street corners and screenings of English-language movies, walking voters one by one through the Byzantine process. In late May, Dzieduszycka-Suinat and Mitch Wolfson, head of AOK Germany, looked at each other and said, in the words of Wolfson: \"There has to be a better way.\" In July, they took the federal registration form, simplified it, and lobbed it into cyberspace. Beyond the 140,000 mostly Democrats who registered online, another 170,000 physically registered through Democrats Abroad, according to John McQueen, the group's international campaign chair. Thousands more signed up through another clever website, the Amsterdam-based Tell an American to Vote. </p> <p>What infuriates AOK more than anything else, though, is the vast disparity in money and energy between the military and civilian efforts. Overseas civilians, who turn out at half the rate of the military, arguably need more help, they say. While FVAP spent its $5.5m budget mainly to reach half a million soldiers - a ratio that works out to $11 per vote - the Democratic National Committee spent $50,000 on a website that worked out to less than 75 cents a vote. </p> <p>Republicans eschewed pavement-pounding and bought dozens of ads in the military Stars &amp; Stripes, International Herald Tribune and English-language papers in key countries like Mexico, Canada and Israel, which together host some 1.5 million eligible American voters, says Hills of Republicans Abroad. Registrations are up fourfold over 2000. The Bush campaign is focused on large communities of American retirees overseas and counting on its traditional bases among businesspeople abroad and the military, where, Hills says, \"we're very confident we're going to get a strong majority\". </p> <p>Which way these hordes of new voters go is, in fact, the big overseas question - assuming they get to vote. Democrats and Republicans alike see gold in both the civilian and military camps. What's undisputed is that the Bush administration has galvanised overseas voters as never before. \"The entire world is against Bush, and we reflect that view that America has lost all its credibility abroad,\" says McQueen of Democrats Abroad. \"I was tired of cringing in the supermarket whenever I spoke English to my kids, knowing how much we as Americans were hated,\" says Dzieduszycka-Suinat. Hills, for her part, reports that many Republicans, angered at what they see as unjust attacks, are coming out in equal droves to support the president. On both sides, stories abound of older Americans, and dual citizens who've kept their American passports, emerging like Rip Van Winkle to vote for the first time in 30 or 40 years. </p> <p>In reality, the political affiliation of these voters is unknown. Both sides claim a 60% edge: Democrats, based on a Zogby study, say that Americans with passports tend to vote liberal. Republicans, meanwhile, cite international business and the conservatism of Pentagon civilian employees and soldiers. Yet both estimates are what military people call SWAG - scientific wild-ass guesses - about a woolly and ever-growing overseas population of civil servants, diplomats, employees of global businesses, students, journalists, artists, academics and, yes, soldiers on the battlefield. </p> <p>Since January, when the Pentagon decreed \"100% contact,\" every officer and enlisted man or woman has had a registration application pressed into his or her hands. Soldiers have been exhorted to vote at daily formation and while watching ballgames on Armed Forces TV, and they are reminded that \"It's Your Future - Vote for It\" on the bottom on their paycheques. After the \"horror story\" of 2000, the military is \"extremely vigilant\" this time around, says Captain Christina Maxwell-Borges, a voting assistance officer at the US Army Installation Management Agency in Stuttgart. </p> <p>At US Army Europe headquarters in Heidelberg, voting activists and Americans who've worked for the Army for decades say ordinary soldiers are more motivated than they've ever seen. Even with the massive deployment of voting officers, a non-partisan citizens group like the NAACP, which conducted registration drives on base, was swamped. \"Often we couldn't keep up with the demand,\" says Billee Manigault, an NAACP volunteer. \"There's a definite interest in participating,\" echoes Charles Keene of Democrats Abroad and the NAACP. \"From almost everyone you heard, it was, 'You better believe I'm going to vote.'\" </p> <p>Despite several recent polls showing staunch support for President Bush among high-ranking officers, soldiers on base and Pentagon civilians active in Democratic politics say the mood in the military is far more mixed. The controversial mission in Iraq has brought a sea change in political attitudes on base, these observers report. McQueen, a retired military civil servant, says, \"You're not seeing the kind of pressure to vote Republican you always had in the past.\" </p> <p>The strong pro-Republican culture that emerged in the military in the wake of Vietnam has begun to splinter, many observers say. A report in the Washington Monthly last year described rank-and-file soldiers, who are disproportionately non-white, working-class and female, as increasingly diverging from an ideologically conservative officer corps. \"For a long time here, Democrats were in the closet,\" concurs Trenton Browne, a military security contractor who works on bases from Heidelberg to Kaiserslautern. \"Now in the lower ranks you hear people speaking openly about their dissent.\" </p> <p>Gauging the overseas vote thus becomes a numbers game. Military turnout at home and abroad is high. More than 60% of soldiers overseas voted in 2000, double the record of expatriates, who turned out at a rate of 37%, according to the FVAP (though in both groups, the number of uncounted votes dropped those figures by at least 15%). Many expect even higher overseas military turnout this year. How many of those 500,000 active duty service people will vote for Kerry, or Bush, is the question. </p> <p>A survey of 4,000 service people, released last week by the Military Times, revealed strong loyalty to the president: 72% of those on active duty would vote for him, and 17% would vote for Kerry. In the view of military analyst Peter Feaver of Duke University, the early traction Kerry had with the troops has been lost by his recent hammering of the war as a \"colossal mistake\". Being a decorated Vietnam veteran doesn't improve Kerry's stock with the \"career military\" people polled by the Military Times, either; in fact, two-thirds hold the senator's long-ago anti-war activism against him. </p> <p>The survey, however, concentrated on higher-ranking service people, and is not representative of the rank and file. Along Heidelberg's main street, off-duty soldiers, some fresh from combat in Iraq, divided evenly between rejecting Kerry because \"he doesn't support the troops\" and supporting him \"because a lot of us feel jerked around\". \"People think the military is totally Republican, and that's definitely not true,\" says one strolling soldier, a burly 30-year-old from Florida. \"There's a lot of different views within the ranks.\" Capt Maxwell-Borges, the Stuttgart voting officer, agrees. \"Surprisingly, it's been really mixed,\" she says. \"A lot of people support Kerry because he's a veteran and says he's going to increase military spending, and others are the more traditional pro-Republicans. But I've been on bases in the past three elections and I have to say that this time [political views] seem a lot more varied.\" </p> <p>No one expects the soldier vote to swing to Kerry, but a softening of Bush's overseas military support could be significant. \"Even 100% military turnout overseas only equals 160,000 additional votes,\" points out Brett Rierson, co-founder of the Democratic Hong Kong website. With activists guesstimating that the overseas civilian haul could be as high as 2 million, a strong showing for Kerry among enlisted troops could neutralise the Republican advantage. </p> <p>In any event, it's unlikely anyone will know until well after November 2. Several states, in a scramble to accommodate overseas voters' late ballots, have extended their deadlines. As it now stands, Florida, Washington, Iowa, Colorado and Illinois allow ballots to be received late, in some cases up to 10 days after election day. The justice department, at the prompting of the FVAP, has sued Pennsylvania to extend its deadline by two weeks as well. </p> <p>Nor will Americans find out how effectively the overseas vote has been handled until \"after the horses have left the barn,\" says Joe Smallhoover, legal counsel for Democrats Abroad. Voting reform passed by Congress in 2002 requires states to track overseas ballots, at long last. But more to the point, Smallhoover says: \"We have to do more than reform the FVAP; we have to reform the whole system.\" Wright, the military voting expert, agrees. He advocates placing the whole overseas voting operation in the hands of the new Election Assistance Commission, a far better-funded agency created by the 2002 Help America Vote act that is supposed to help states improve their equipment and procedures. </p> <p>All this, however, lies in the future. In the meantime, Democrats Abroad has formed a \"rapid response\" team to unsnarl problems voters abroad have encountered with their county election officials. Thousands of lawyers on both sides are renting office space in battleground states, ready to pounce on illegalities in stateside balloting and absentee votes. For now, overseas voters groping their empty mailboxes can only download the write-in ballot, send it in - in the faith that local election officials will accept it - and pray. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Alix Christie is a reporter and former editor of the foreign service of the San Francisco Chronicle</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited</p> <p>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",

  "<p>Edward Said was many things for many people, but in reality, his was a musician's soul, in the deepest sense of the word. </p> <p>He wrote about important universal issues such as exile, politics, integration. However, the most surprising thing for me, as his friend and great admirer, was the realisation that, on many occasions, he formulated ideas and reached conclusions through music; and he saw music as a reflection of the ideas that he had regarding other issues. </p> <p>This is one of the main reasons why I believe that Said was such an important figure. His journey through this world took place precisely at a time when the humanity of music, its human value as well as the value of thought, the transcendence of the idea written in sounds, were, and regrettably continue to be, concepts in decline. </p> <p>His fierce anti-specialisation led him to criticise very strongly, and very fairly, the fact that musical education was becoming increasingly poor, not only in the United States - which, after all, had imported the music of old Europe - but also in the very countries that had produced music's greatest figures: for example, in Germany, which had produced Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Schumann and many others; or in France, which had produced Debussy and Ravel. Furthermore, he perceived a sign that bothered him exceedingly, a perception that was to unite us very quickly: even when there was musical education, it was carried out in a very specialised way. In the best of cases, young people were offered the opportunity to practice an instrument, to acquire necessary knowledge of theory, of musicology, and of everything that a musician needs professionally. </p> <p>But, at the same time, there existed a widespread and growing incomprehension of the impossibility of articulating the content of a musical work. After all, if it were possible to express in words the content of one of Beethoven's symphonies, we would no longer have a need for that symphony. But the fact that it is impossible to express in words the music's content does not mean that there is no content. </p> <p>The paradox consists of the fact that music is only sound, but sound, in itself, is not music. There lies Said's main idea as a musician who was also an excellent pianist. </p> <p>In recent years, due to his terrible illness, he was unable to maintain the level of physical energy necessary to play the piano. I remember many unforgettable times that we spent playing Schubert pieces for four hands. Two or three years ago, I had a concert at Carnegie Hall in New York and he was going through a very difficult period of his illness. The concert was on a Sunday afternoon. Although he knew that I had arrived that very morning from Chicago, he showed up very early at rehearsal with a volume of Schubert's pieces for four hands. He told me: \"Today I want us to play at least eight bars, not for the pleasure of playing, but because I need it to survive.\" </p> <p>As you can imagine, at that moment, just in from the airport and with one hour of rehearsal before the afternoon's concert, the last thing I wanted to do was to play Schubert for four hands. But, as is always the case, when you teach you learn, and when you give you receive. And you learn when you teach because the student asks questions that you no longer even ask yourself, because they are part of the almost automatic thought which each one of us develops. And suddenly, the question addresses something that forces us to rethink it from its origin, from its very essence. </p> <p>Naturally, I did it, with the greatest pleasure, because my dear friend asked me to do so. But when we played, those few minutes of a Schubert rondo - an extremely beautiful piece, which was not, however, the deepest or most transcendent - I felt musically enriched in a completely unexpected way. That was Edward Said. </p> <p>Said was interested in detail. Indeed, he understood perfectly that musical genius or musical talent requires tremendous attention to detail. The genius attends to detail as if it were the most important thing. And in doing so, he does not lose sight of the big picture; rather, he manages to trace out that big picture. Because the big picture, in music as in thought, must be the result of the coordination of small details. </p> <p>He had a refined knowledge of the art of composition and orchestration. He knew that in the second act of Tristan and Isolde, at a certain moment, the horns withdraw behind the stage and, a couple of bars later, the same musical note re-emerges in the pit orchestra's clarinets. So many singers I have had the honour and pleasure of collaborating with on that piece are unaware of that detail and look behind them to see where the sound is coming from. He took interest in these things, because he understood that this meticulous interest in detail conferred a grandeur upon the whole. </p> <p>He also knew how to distinguish clearly between power and force, which constituted one of the main ideas of his struggle. He knew quite well that, in music, force is not power, something that many of the world's political leaders do not perceive. The difference between power and force is equivalent to the difference between volume and intensity in music. When one says to a musician, \"You are not playing intensely enough\", his first reaction is to play louder. And it is exactly the opposite: the lower the volume, the greater the need for intensity, and the greater the volume, the greater the need for a calm force in the sound. </p> <p>These are some examples that illustrate my conviction that his concept of life and of the world originated and lay in music. Another example is to be found in his idea of interconnection. In music, there are no independent elements. The character and intention of the simplest melody change drastically with a complex harmony. That is learned through music, not through political life. Thus emerges the impossibility of separating elements, the perception that everything is connected, the need to always unite logical thought and intuitive emotion. How often do we abandon all logic for the sake of an emotional need? In music, this is impossible, since music cannot be made exclusively with reason or with emotion. What is more: if those elements may be separated, they are no longer music, but a collection of sounds. </p> <p>His concept of inclusion also derived from music, as well as the integration principle. The same could be applied to his book Orientalism. It speaks of the idea of Oriental seduction versus western production. In music, there is no production without seduction. Productive as a musical idea may be, if it is lacking the seduction of the necessary sound, it is insufficient. This is why I say that Edward Said was, for many, a great thinker, a fighter for the rights of his people, and an incomparable intellectual. But for me, he was always, really, a musician, in the deepest sense of the term. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Translated from Spanish by Kimberly Borchard.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>MASSACRE OF 50 IRAQI SOLDIERS</b></p> <p>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's militant group - which now calls itself Al-Qaida in Iraq, or the al-Qaida Group of Jihad in the Land of Two Rivers - claimed responsibility last night for the slaughter of 49 Iraqi army recruits near Baquba.</p> <p>\"The Iraqi men had been on their way home on Saturday night to the cities of Amara and Kut from a training base run by the Americans outside Mandali in eastern Iraq, near the Iranian border, in five minibuses,\" reports the Independent. \"They had checked in their weapons at the base and were dressed in civilian clothes. They were stopped on a stretch of road between Baladruz and Badra in the Diyala province by insurgents dressed as security personnel at a fake checkpoint ... The recruits were taken in batches of 12 to the side of the road and made to remove their shoes and lie face down on the ground before being shot in the back of the head.\"</p> <p>The massacre \"makes a nonsense of claims that the situation on the ground is stabilising\", says the paper.

So lay off Prince Harry.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;sessionid=WO5ITNDTMYCBVQFIQMGSM5WAVCBQWJVC?xml=/opinion/2004/10/25/do2505.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/10/25/ixportal.html&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=41775\">Telegraph: WF Deedes</a></p> <p><b>BREAKING NEWS</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,1335434,00.html\">Six men have been convicted of a string of [word omitted] attacks on the remote Pacific island of Pitcairn following trials that exposed a culture of abuse on the tiny home of descendants of the 18th-century Bounty mutineers</a>.</p> <p><b> COMING UP ON GUARDIAN UNLIMITED TODAY</b></p> <p>Nearly 380 tons of powerful explosives have gone missing from a former military installation in Iraq, according to the country's interim government.</p> <p>Tony Blair will hold his monthly press conference at Downing Street at noon.</p> <p>EU interior ministers will meet to agree plans to streamline decision-making on asylum and immigration.</p> <p>Powerful aftershocks were felt in north-western Japan today as tens of thousands of people waited in evacuation centres following the earthquake last weekend.</p> <p>The government is using a \"climate of fear\" over terrorism and crime to force through changes that threaten ordinary people's civil liberties, the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy will warn.</p>",
  "<p>* As we struggle with the prospect of Graham Norton's ground-breaking BBC1 debut (Strictly Dance Fever, since you ask), Monkey was reminded of his autobiography, So Me, a hot contender for book of the month. \"In the midst of all our American excitement we would occasionally remember that we were actually supposed to be thinking up a new show to do on the BBC. At the time of writing we still have no idea what it is, but hopefully when this book is published it'll be on the air and not a complete disaster.\" Better luck next time, Graham. </p> <p>* The News of the World has the youngest staff on Fleet Street, boasted Andy Coulson at the Society of Editors conference, with an average age of 32. Crikey. Impressive stuff. But with the likes of news editor James Weatherup, deputy news editor David Rigby and Greg Miskiw racking up around 150 years between them, Monkey can't help but feel that its senior editorial team is more Oldie than Heat. At least Ian Edmondson's arrival from the People will bring the average down a bit. Rumour has it he's 35. </p> <p>* Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, Wallpaper* founder and presenter of new BBC4 media show The Desk, has some interesting thoughts on London. It's a \"much more dynamic media hub\" than New York, he tells a US website. \"You have to be pretty pathetic to be unemployed as a journalist in London because there's so much work.\" Let's hope some of those pathetic types appear as guests on The Desk. </p> <p>* Richard Desmond's absence from OK! magazine's coverage of its own celebrity awards had Monkey's jaw dropping a fortnight ago. The boss clearly took our comments to heart, making five appearances in the Daily Star and Express last week with his celebrity band, RD Crusaders. Even better was the double page \"editorial\" devoted to the Express Home Shopping Channel on Wednesday. \"It's aimed at a British audience,\" explained Gloria Hunniford, helpfully. \"QVC always seems very American to me.\" </p> <p>* Never a slouch in blowing its own horn, the BBC was unexpectedly shy when presenting its radio listening figures last week. \"It's a solid set of results,\" said BBC Radio's head of research Jo Hamilton. Solid? A record share and its biggest-ever lead over commercial radio and that's the best they can do? Nothing to do with charter review and accusations that its empire - boosted by endless cross-promotion - puts fledgling commercial digital efforts to the sword. No sirree. </p> <p>* Radio 1 DJs celebrated their ratings renaissance with a dinner cooked by Colin Murray. The afternoon presenter whipped up mushroom risotto, lobster spaghetti and steak and chips at a central London eatery for his fellow DJs. But nil points for film critic James King, whose special pudding request was Weetabix, bananas and soya milk. What's wrong with jelly and ice cream? </p> <p>* As the death knell chimes closer for the Times' broadsheet - it is already tabloid-only in Ireland, Scotland and much of the west country - Monkey wonders if you can guess who gave this pledge to readers in a full page ad on June 4? \"We are committed to both compact and broadsheet.\" It's not Times editor Robert Thomson, is it? </p> <p>* What does the BBC's licence fee campaign Building Public Value have in common with Labour's plan to win a third term? They both have their roots in a book called Creating Public Value: Strategic management in government. The once obscure tome by Harvard University professor Mark Moore inspired both Downing Street policy wonks, and former BBC chairman Gavyn Davies and Will Hutton, who played a key part in framing the BBC document. Small world, eh? </p> <p>* Are Tory spin doctors as dozy as Boris? On Wednesday, Michael Howard was virtually guaranteed to dominate Prime Minister's Questions, thanks to unease over the Iraq troops issue. So what day was the hapless Spectator editor sent to Liverpool? Wednesday. The result: The Telegraph ran Boris on p3 and PMQs on p8; the Times tabloid put Boris on p11, PMQs on p28; and the Mail sent its sketch-writer with Boris (p4), and so didn't cover PMQs at all. A PR triumph! </p> <p>* MTV may have got its politically correct knickers (or should that be underwear?) in a twist. The station pixelates videos which feature singers smoking in post-school hours, but hip-hop minx Khia is free to simulate oral sex with various parts of a 4 x 4 in the promo for My Neck, My Back (\"kiss my neck, kiss my back, kiss my, ah!, just like that\") at tea-time without fear of censorship. </p> <p>* Bananas to the BBC's drama department, which is working overtime to bring the more farflung bits of the British Isles to the screen. The Welsh town of Usk is being used to send Dr Who back to Victorian Britain, while Edinburgh was roped in to represent Manchester for panoramic viewers in the forthcoming period drama, North And South.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps the only thing more surprising than the sheer size of Procter &amp; Gamble's annual marketing budget is that the company rarely says anything about it. Massive but silent, fuelled by the UK's largest main media advertising spend of \u00a3200m, P&amp;G inexorably continues on its mission to market its brands further and further into the hearts and minds of consumers and, of course, their wallets. </p> <p>The scale is enormous. P&amp;G is in every supermarket aisle with brands such as Fairy, Flash, Pantene, Bounty and Crest. More than 80% of British and Irish households buy at least two P&amp;G brands each month, from a portfolio that stretches all the way to Pringles, Vicks, Hugo Boss and Lacoste. </p> <p>At the helm is Roisin Donnelly, UK &amp; Ireland head of marketing and corporate marketing director. \"I think I was born to be in marketing,\" says Donnelly, a 43-year-old mother of three girls aged 3, 5 and 7. \"I used to collect proofs of purchase even when there were no promotions. There was one Christmas when I got my gifts all from consumer promotions. I was eight and a half. My grandmother got a plastic jug from the toothpaste we were using.\" </p> <p>Her mission is to \"delight\" the consumer and get close to her, she says. It is always a \"her\" in P&amp;G land, for as Donnelly says, their research shows that even if it is a male shopper, most decisions are made by the woman of the household. Donnelly's war chest tops the government spend of \u00a3122.8m last year and L'Or\u00e9al's \u00a396m. And the P&amp;G marketing budget for in-store promotions, direct mail, public relations and market research is \u00a3400m. </p> <p>Donnelly projects supreme confidence. She gained an MA in English and studied maths and economics at Glasgow university, where she got the better of future MPs Charles Kennedy and Liam Fox by winning a maiden speaker award. </p> <p>The only time she momentarily appears blindsided is when asked about P&amp;G's famous secrecy. \"It was very much the company philosophy that if we tell you our secrets we would lose the competitive edge,\" she says. But the company has become much more open since AG Lafley became its global head in 2000. Marketers have a heavy presence in its executive ranks. </p> <p>Donnelly, who leads a marketing de partment of 70 and corporate marketing department of 65, says: \"Our philosophy is that the consumer is the boss. They make the purchase decision every day. If we delight her, she will reward us with sales. If we disappoint her, she won't.\" </p> <p>The company is increasing its advertising spend as it launches new products, and it does not shirk the unorthodox. To reach children, its Sunny D brand sponsored the virtual swimming pool on a children's website. To reach young working women, a billboard for its Aussie shampoo sent a competition entry code to their mobile phones. </p> <p>And then there is Maureen McGrath, a Dot Cottonish character from its mini soap opera adverts for Daz, who has just been ruthlessly killed off. </p> <p>\"Poor Maureen,\" says Donnelly. But consumers get to share in Maureen's legacy via discount coupons in Daz boxes. \"Will everyone get their hands on Maureen's millions? Find out with Daz, the soap you can believe in,\" chirps the latest advert, launched last week. </p> <p>\"People have now got used to Maureen and she is now leaving her money to the Daz consumer. It's a brand new way of TV interacting with the consumer,\" says Donnelly. \"We have understood the Daz consumer. She likes Daz, she has a relationship with Daz, but we have taken that to a new level with this soap. She has got more engrossed in the characters.\" </p> <p>And presumably more engrossed in Daz, at the expense of rival brands. Another Daz competition offered shoppers a prize of appearing in a Daz advert. Castings were held in shopping centres. \"They knew the campaign, they loved the campaign, they wanted to be on telly. It's just different ways of making the advertising come much closer to the consumer,\" says Donnelly. </p> <p>That means listening and understanding. If new members of the marketing team for Pampers don't know how to change a nappy, they are sent out to learn. </p> <p>When consumers told Donnelly they wanted advertising to get out of the kitchen, she sent Ridley Scott's son, Luke, to Iceland to film an Ariel advert in which an Eskimo woman washes her baby's jumpsuit in a hole carved out of the ice. </p> <p>Television advertising has been the lifeblood of P&amp;G's marketing, but that is changing. It still spends 80% of its media budget on TV but increasing sums are being spent on other media. </p> <p>Donnelly sees the future of P&amp;G marketing as being all about talking to consumers in different ways. She cites industry research which suggests that viewers used to recall 70% of what they saw on TV, but that has plunged to 41%. A growing focus is interactive advertising, which can be \"red button\" sites on interactive television. </p> <p>For its Flash cleaning brand, P&amp;G organised an interactive site that tied in with the Disney film Lilo &amp; Stitch, offering a film trailer, free toys and a quiz about messy people. Consumers spent an average of nine minutes interacting with Flash on the site - not bad for a household cleaner. \"For somebody to spend that amount of time with TV really surprises us, but interactive TV is a very powerful medium because the woman is in control.\" </p> <p>Word of mouth is just another medium to use to promote products. \"If a consumer uses a product, discovers something new and loves it, she'll tell a friend.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G uses word of mouth to sell Eraser, a new cleaner that removes difficult stains such as crayon from walls. \"We are getting it into the hands of the right consumers, expert consumers, people who chat to a lot of friends. We are sending it to magazines. It has been recommended by the Good Housekeeping Institute.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G targets experts and \"influencers\". If it is selling beauty, it talks to makeup artists and sends products to celebrities in the hope that they will mention them in magazine interviews. </p> <p>For young people, P&amp;G harnesses recently developed instant messaging technology through a system called Tremor. \"We tell the Tremor members about something or we give them gifts or insights or snippets of news and they share it with their friends.\" </p> <p>But for all the money it devotes to market research, Donnelly is negative about the traditional market research focus group. \"I think the biggest mistake is the focus group, where you get a small number of women into a room who have never met each other and they talk for an hour and a half or two hours about a product and an ad. You are paying them and it's a very blunt instrument. I think you would get more from 10 hours with one woman than you would get from one hour with 10 women.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not since the year that Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around was top of the pops for an ear-mangling 15 weeks, have so many of the nation's listeners been tuning in to BBC radio. </p> <p>The BBC's stations have hit a 10-year ratings high, but the champagne is on ice. The success comes at the expense of commercial rivals in a period when the corporation is desperate to prove it is all about public service, rather than commercialism, in the run up to the renewal of its charter in 2006. </p> <p>BBC radio stations have increased their popularity to a 54.4% share of listening compared to commercial radio's 43.7%, with people listening for longer, according to Radio Joint Audience (Research (Rajar) figures for June to September. Outstanding success came from Radio 1, benefiting from the popularity of Chris Moyles at breakfast, and at Radio 5 Live, whose summer sports coverage was well-received. </p> <p>But the sound drubbing of commercial radio has provoked angry criticism from the sector, which says it cannot, and should not have to, compete with the BBC's unrivalled cross-promotional reach and multimillion pound marketing budget, funded by the licence fee. </p> <p>But commercial radio stations are reporting some outstanding and commercially valuable successes, particularly in the ability to reach out to women and children. </p> <p>The number of hours children aged four to 14 years are listening to commercial radio for has increased by 50% since 1999. Children aged between four to 14 years are listening to commercial stations across the country for a record number of hours (74.7m over the quarter), with the sector taking a 73% share of listening. </p> <p>In the battle for children's attention, commercial radio is holding its own against television, computer games, shopping and a myriad of equally attractive distractions with 78% (6.3 million) of four to 14-year-olds tuning in for an average of 11.8 hours a week. And in the all-important 15- to 24-year-old group - the youngsters with cash to splash on advertisers' products - commercial stations have a 63% share of listening. </p> <p>And more women are tuning in to commercial stations. Jazz FM has reported 78,000 new female listeners tuning in to its station and Capital FM seeing growth among women in the 15 to 24-year-old age group. Overall more women classing themselves as housewives are tuning into commercial radio than ever before, again a valuable sector for advertisers whose marketing budgets keep the stations afloat. </p> <p>Commercial radio has attracted nearly one million more housewives since this time last year, reaching 61.8% of the group. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Data supplied by Thomson Intermedia Plc (<a href=\"http://www.thomson-intermedia.com).\">www.thomson-intermedia.com).</a> For more information call 020 7549 4343</p>"
