  "<p>The sparse crowd at the Nikaia Hall here yesterday did not have to wait long for a cheerleader. She was second on and Michaela Breeze made sure she savoured every moment of being the first woman to represent Britain in weightlifting at the Olympic Games. </p> <p>\"Come on\" chanted the PE teacher from Wales when she stepped on to the platform and with that the three groups of British fans responded, waving flags and making enough noise to allow their favourite to know she was not alone. </p> <p>By her fifth attempt, her efforts to meet the \"pressure\" she somehow thought she was under became too much. She needed smelling salts before equalling her personal best in the clean and jerk category. </p> <p>Having succeeded at 120kg, she then failed at 122.5kg. She ended the competition in ninth position and by the time she was dashing away to buy an ice cream - her first treat for six weeks - Yanging Chen of China was aiming to break the world record. </p> <p>\"Did you see the line-up?\" said Breeze. \"I am 5ft 6in and weigh 58 kilos and they are 4ft nothing and weigh the same. They are not short of stock and do not have far to move the weights.\" </p> <p>Breeze was the tallest in the field but without doubt the most vociferous. While most of her opponents took a small bow before their lift, the Briton did her best to gain as much support as she could. It was fabulous entertainment and back home, her pupils would have been proud of \"Breezy\". </p> <p>Two of the youngsters she coaches had sent her text messages before she had even finished her competition and she will now pass on to them the experience she gained from being part of this occasion. </p> <p>\"I equalled my PB [personal best] which I am happy with, but I missed a couple of lifts because I gambled,\" she said. \"Having lifted 95kg [in the snatch], I thought I would go for it at 97.5 to try to stay with these girls. They were lifting some awesome weights.\" </p> <p>Each competitor has three attempts at the snatch and three at the clean and jerk. The disconcerting factor for Breeze, 25, would have been that she had completed the first session before three of her opponents had even lifted. </p> <p>It was then that Chen cleared 107.5kg, before securing the gold medal with 130kg in the second half of the programme, just not being strong enough to hold on to 135kg which would have broken the world record. But her snatch and total score were Olympic records, reward for a woman who was the last to be selected for the Chinese weightlifting team a year ago. </p> <p>Since then she has received enough funding and support from her country to compete full-time while Breeze, though supported by the lottery, remains a teacher at Ivybridge Community College, Devon, where many of her pupils are competitors in the sport. </p> <p>Weightlifting for women became an Olympic discipline in Sydney four years ago and Breeze is the best in the country, qualifying after finishing fourth in the European Championships in Kiev in April. </p> <p>\"In the 122.5 clean and jerk, it was the first time I had ever got under it,\" she said. \"The minor problem was standing up but it was good with the pressure I was under. </p> <p>\"You know there are people back home expecting big things, so I am hoping I did not disappoint. It is a lonely world to be full-time. If you do not have the training partners or full-time coaching and the medical back-up you need, it is virtually impossible. My coach does not even live where I do. We do a lot of the communication over the phone. I see him once or twice a month so my job keeps my mind going.\" </p> <p>Meeting the weight for this 58-category has not been easy. Breeze has been on a strict diet for six weeks, losing over 6kg and it started to take an effect. </p> <p>\"I had a couple of jam rolls before I competed to raise my sugar levels,\" she said. \"But it was hot out there and I used smelling salts to clear my head as I was feeling a bit dizzy in the warm up room. </p> <p>\"When you sit around waiting, your legs can go to sleep. I could not feel my legs and even on the platform I could feel my whole body shaking. Now the first thing on the menu is ice cream.\" Along with three large scoops of pride.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Lewis-Francis will arrive in Athens today without a worry about the soaring temperatures and as chilled out as he has ever been. </p> <p>The reason? \"I have discovered how great using an ice bath can be,\" Lewis-Francis said last night, describing how he has plunged enthusiastically into a new aid to physical preparation as one of three members of the 100 metres squad who have spent the past eight days at the British holding camp in Cyprus.</p> <p>He explained: \"My last race was at Crystal Palace, where I did not run well. At the time I said I was suffering from the hot conditions, but it is not the same out here.</p> <p>\"That was a nasty, sticky night in London but in Cyprus it has not been as warm as I thought and I have felt good. I have no worries about adapting to the conditions once we land in Athens because training and preparation have gone well - and I have discovered the plus points of jumping into an ice bath.</p> <p>\"There were three bins at the stadium where we trained and they were filled with ice. It is something I have never done before and I always thought I would never do.</p> <p>\"We have ice baths available at the high-performance centre in Birmingham where I train, but if I want to feel cold normally I can stand outside for two minutes.</p> <p>\"Not here. At first it was a horrible, disgusting feeling getting into the bath. I did not know what to do with myself because it was so cold. I was in there for a few minutes until the ice melted but I have found how effective it can be.</p> <p>\"I know many of my fellow athletes use them and I have to say that the next morning when I woke, I was feeling great. The feeling in my legs was tremendous. I was really refreshed.</p> <p>\"I thought to myself, though, I'm not going to suffer alone - my mum always told me to share things - so when the others were in there, I made sure I put extra ice in to make it even colder.</p> <p>\"It was all a bit of fun but hopefully when I get to the start line I'll feel the effects even more.</p> <p>\"I am so excited about what is ahead. I cannot believe I am going to be part of the Olympic Games. It really hit me on Friday night.</p> <p>\"I have had a fantastic experience with the team in Cyprus, training, acclimatising and enjoying being with fellow athletes at a camp for the first time.</p> <p>\"As a junior I went on trips but this experience is all new to me. On Friday, when the opening ceremony was taking place in Athens, we had our own special celebration in our hotel and it was such a memorable occasion. Denise Lewis walked through the hotel carrying a flag and Team GB followed. We were walking in two by two and we were applauded by the people in the hotel. It was very emotional and it was such an honourable thing for them to clap us.</p> <p>\"Audley Harrison was there with us and Team GB went to the hotel's harbour area where two giant screens were up to watch the opening ceremony.</p> <p>\"That was when realisation struck. In the past I have always watched the opening ceremony from home. Now I am here, and this week I am going to be part of the Olympics.</p> <p>\"Am I confident? I am always confident because I do not want to run just to be part of the occasion. I am happy with the way the preparation has gone - now for the real thing.\"</p> <p>For Mark Lewis-Francis, the real thing begins on Saturday with the 100m heats.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Once again, the Daily Express scoops the world, with a front page story headlined \"PLOT TO KILL BLAIR\". \"Asylum seekers with hi-tech equipment and maps caught half a mile from PM's home,\" it states, with the inside report entitled \"Al-Qaida scouts found mile from PM's home\". If we have a quibble - and it's so tiny we almost feel pedantic for mentioning it - it is with the very last paragraph, which deals with the release of the two Lithuanians after they were arrested last September. \"After they had been thoroughly interviewed,\" it states, \"the force were satisfied no security issues were involved.\" Agonisingly, our attempts to congratulate editor Peter Hill on the scoop prove fruitless. \"I've spoken to him,\" says his secretary eventually. \"He says if you want to discuss this you need to call his PR agency, Maclaurins.\" Sorry, we reply, but have we died and woken up in Spiceworld? Is the editor unable to answer questions about headlines in his paper without referring us to his publicist? \"That's correct,\" comes the answer. <p><b>\u00b7</b> We really haven't the energy to indulge Peter's Tom Cruise fantasies, but given that he sits on the Press Complaints Commission we wonder if it isn't time for some kind of intervention by well-meaning friends. After all, it was less than a year ago that Peter, then editing the Daily Star, splashed with a completely fabricated story headlined \"ASYLUM SEEKERS EAT OUR DONKEYS\". Does it worry you, we ask William Gore at the PCC, that an editor on the commission is apparently too stupid to understand the first clause of the code of practice, which centres on accuracy and distortion? \"That may be your view,\" says William, carefully. \"But we can't act unless we get a complaint from a member of the public.\" Naturally. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Nothing attests to the homespun charm of Brussels so much as its insistence on styling the wired and watchtowered fence on the EU's new eastern borders as \"the Lace Curtain\" - particularly given the community's virulent opposition to Israel's security fence (the Venetian Blind, if you will). But an intriguing report by the Israeli foreign ministry's press monitoring service suggests the two may have more common ground than the EU cares to admit. It reveals that two Israeli companies, Magal Security Systems and El-Far Electronics, are linking up with international partners to bid for Lace Curtain construction contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds. As Magal are rather experienced - they built the security fence - some wonder what will happen if an Israeli bid offers the best value. Although, given it's the EU, we hardly think that'll have much bearing on anything. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In America, George Bush's disregard for the sanctity of life has upset Peta. It seems that, during his recent appearance on the Outdoor Life Network's Fishing With Roland Martin, he threw the smallest fish caught to his dog Barney. Peta president Ingrid Newkirk is outraged, and has written to the president, demanding that he \"recognise that fish are sentient\" and amend his ways accordingly. Yes. Good luck with that one, Ingrid. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Confusion, meanwhile, besets Dubya's attempt to convince doubters that the presence of an Iraqi soccer team at the Olympics indicates a country in rude health. On Saturday, the White House press corp's first pool report noted that when asked who Bush would cheer if the US drew Iraq, spokesman Scott McClellan replied that was \"a good question\" (particularly as the US isn't actually fielding a team). \"To clear up any possible misconception,\" runs the relaxed opener to the day's second report, \"Scott McClellan says Bush would of course support the American soccer team in any hypothetical game with Iraq.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance: Robin Cook, at 11.30pm on Sunday, on the slow Piccadilly line from Heathrow airport into London. Final proof, given his \u00a3450,000 Murdoch book deal, that the Heathrow Express has got absurdly expensive.</p>",

  "<p>Hal Sutton today named 50-year-old Jay Haas and Stewart Cink to complete his team for America's attempt to win back the Ryder Cup in Detroit next month. </p> <p>Haas will become the second oldest player in cup history after Raymond Floyd. His debut was 21 years ago and his last appearance in 1995, when his defeat to Philip Walton gave Europe victory at Oak Hill. </p> <p>Even though he has not won a tournament since the 1993 Texas Open he was given a wild card by Jack Nicklaus into last year's Presidents Cup and now receives another call-up after falling out of an automatic top 10 spot on the final day of the three-year race for places. </p> <p>Cink, a member of the side which lost at The Belfry two years ago, was Sutton's other pick after finishing 14th on the standings. <br> </p> <p>His experience of the match and three recent top 10 finishes swayed things his way in Sutton's mind as Steve Flesch and Jerry Kelly, who finished 11th and 13th in the points table, would have been rookies.<br></p> <p>Sutton already has five of those in Kenny Perry, Chad Campbell, Fred Funk and the two men who forced their way in by coming second and fourth in the US PGA championship yesterday - Chris DiMarco and Chris Riley.<br> </p> <p>There are six survivors of the team which lost the trophy two years ago - major winners Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Davis Love, Jim Furyk and David Toms, plus Cink. </p> <p>Love is the most experienced member of the side with five caps. Masters champion Mickelson will be winning his fifth and Woods his fourth. </p> <p>While Bernhard Langer is unlikely to have a major champion in his line-up - the last time that happened was 1981 - Sutton has felt able to overlook four of America's last six major winners.<br></p> <p>It will have come as no surprise to Ben Curtis, Shaun Micheel or Rich Beem that they did not get picked, but Todd Hamilton's Open victory was only last month and he had hoped it would earn him a debut. <br></p> <p>Justin Leonard, America's match-winner in controversial fashion in Boston in 1999, would have been an automatic selection if he had won the US PGA title, but the 1997 Open champion bogeyed two of the last three holes and then lost the play-off to Vijay Singh. If he had won the play-off Riley would have missed out. It was only the second top 10 finish Leonard had had all year, however, and he knew that counted against him - as did the fact that in two cup matches he has never actually won a game. </p> <p>The Americans will again look far the stronger on paper, but Europe have revelled in the underdog role. They have won three of the last four clashes and have held the trophy aloft at six of the last nine matches. </p> <p>Oakland Hills will stage the first contest on United States soil since the scenes five years ago. Leonard sparked celebrations with a dramatic 45-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, but they were premature. Jose Maria Olazabal still had a chance to birdie as well and if he had done so then the overall match was still alive. </p> <p>Having been subjected to crowd heckling, with Colin Montgomerie the principal target of that, the European camp were outraged by the actions of some American players, vice-captain Sam Torrance singling out Tom Lehman - \"a man of God\" - for fierce criticism. </p> <p>Torrance took over the captaincy from Mark James and following the 12-month postponement caused by the September 11 terrorist attacks in America the match at The Belfry was conducted in good spirit inside and outside the ropes.<br></p> <p>Now Sutton and Langer are hoping the same will be the case, although Langer will be warning his players about the possibility of a \"hostile\" atmosphere.</p> <p><strong>The US team in full</strong></p> <p>Chad Campbell, Stewart Cink, Chris DiMarco, Fred Funk, Jim Furyk, Jay Haas, Davis Love, Phil Mickelson, Kenny Perry, Chris Riley, David Toms, Tiger Woods.</p>",

  "The UN security council has condemned the massacre last week of more than 160 Tutsi Congolese refugees in Burundi. <p>Most of the victims were women, children and babies, shot dead and burned as they slept in shelters at the Gatumba refugee transit camp on Friday.</p> <p>Up to 20,000 Congolese Tutsi refugees have taken shelter in UN camps in Burundi after fleeing Congo, terrified of being attacked by government troops, local militia and civilians in eastern Congo.</p> <p>The UN security council, which met yesterday in an emergency session, urged the authorities in Burundi and neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo to work together and bring those responsible to justice quickly.</p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, said he was \"shocked and outraged\" by the killings.</p> <p>The Forces for National Liberation (FNL), a Hutu rebel group, took responsibility for the attack, saying they were aiming to hit a military camp nearby.</p> <p>The nearly 3,500-strong FNL is the only rebel group refusing to join a power sharing government to end a five-year long civil war that has pitted Burundi's politically dominant Tutsi minority against rebels from the Hutu majority.</p> <p>The war, which involved fighters from five countries, has left more than three million people dead, mostly through hunger and disease. </p> <p>A UN peacekeeping force in Burundi, due to have 5,650 soldiers when it reaches full strength, was authorised by the security council in May to ensure the implementation of the peace process.</p> <p>The former international development secretary, Clare Short, warned that the international community was not focused enough on driving forward a peace process to end the fighting in the DRC, Rwanda and Burundi. </p> <p>\"What we have got is failed states and marauding bands of killers and constant hatred between two peoples,\" she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p> <p>\"If we leave it, there will be endless killing, desperate poverty ... and we will have a failed continent with all the consequences of instability and danger for its neighbour Europe.

  "<p>Sponsoring the Olympics has much less impact on European consumers than it does on north Americans, says a new study that will prompt sponsors of the Athens games, such as Coca-Cola, to question the value of their investment.</p> <p>The soft drinks company has reportedly spent \u00a380m on sponsorship and advertisements associated with the games, while the official sponsors, including Kodak, McDonald's, Panasonic, Samsung, Visa and Adidas have spent $1.34bn (\u00a3728m) on sponsorship.</p> <p>The study by Dynamic Logic, the independent marketing effectiveness researcher, found that while 25% of north American respondents said they paid closer attention to adverts associated with the Olympics, only 12% of Europeans did so. </p> <p>A greater number of north Americans also said they were likely to pay closer attention to adverts that feature the Olympic rings than Europeans - 66% of respondents compared with 51%.</p> <p>Half the north Americans surveyed said they thought Olympic sponsors were industry leaders, compared with 40% of Europeans. </p> <p>\"It may well have something to do with how well countries feel they are going to do,\" said Suzanne Moorey-Denham, the managing director Europe of Dynamic Logic.</p> <p>US interest in sponsorship could be greater because Americans are simply more interested in the games. </p> <p>\"Perhaps it's because they will romp home with more awards than we do,\" Ms Moorey-Denham said.</p> <p>The publicity hoopla surrounding the Olympics had failed to affect many people, with only 51% recalling any advertising that carried a tagline, \"official sponsors of the 2004 Olympic Games\".</p> <p>Ms Moorey-Denham said the findings were \"good news for super brands\" because brands not sponsoring the Olympics would have even lower recall figures.</p> <p>\"Super brands find it harder and harder to reach a mass audience,\" she said.</p> <p>McDonald's is trying to ignite excitement around its Olympics sponsorship with adverts that show Ronald McDonald competing in events and by flying in staff from around the world to serve athletes at three special sites.</p> <p>Ms Denham said that some of the results for the sponsors in the study might look low but sponsors were willing to pay a lot of money to remain in a favourable light in consumers' eyes. \"People can be just that little bit more favourable to a brand name and no-one knows why,\" she added.</p> <p>The online study of 458 people was conducted by research company Dynamic Logic in America and Europe in June and July.</p> <p>On the eve of the 1994 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer in Norway, 43% of people could not name an Olympics sponsor unaided, a study by marketing analysts Corporate Research found.</p> <p>The report embarrassed sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Visa card, because study respondents readily identified rivals such as Pepsi and American Express as being Olympic sponsors. </p> <p>Ms Moorey-Denham said that misattribution of brands was a common problem for many companies.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Opposition parties yesterday called for improved scrutiny of links between government health advisers and drug companies amid accusations of a potential conflict of interest involving the chairman of the committee that approved the new five-in-one inoculation for infants. <p>Michael Langman, the chairman of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI), has declared a \"non-personal interest\" in Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD), one of two drug companies that own the vaccine's sole supplier, because it provides \"industrial support\" for his work as a professor of medicine at Birmingham University.</p> <p>The relationship is declared on the committee's website but over the weekend Conservatives called for changes in the way vaccines are considered and the Liberal Democrats also voiced reservations.</p> <p>The vaccine, developed by Aventis Pasteur MSD, a joint venture betweek MSD and Aventis Pasteur, is said by government officials to be an improvement on the previous four-in-one combination for diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and Hib, and the separate oral polio vaccine. It will be used from the end of this month.</p> <p>Prof Langman was not speaking to the media yesterday but a Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"Prof Langman has not received any personal benefit from Aventis Pasteur MSD since becoming chairman of the JCVI.</p> <p>\"He has declared all his interests in strict accordance with the code of practice. Prof Langman has a non-personal interest in Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme. The funding from this goes straight to his university and includes support for a clinical trial in colorectal cancer and for advice on chronic digestive disease.</p> <p>\"The code makes clear that in such cases of non-personal interests, it is not necessary for people to stand aside from the work of the committee. The declarations of interests' code of practice reflects the advice of the Committee on Public Appointments.\"</p> <p>Prof Langman declared similar non-personal interests in two other companies, Astra and Novartis.</p> <p>Other committtee members also declared interests. Andrew Hall, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, received non-personal industrial support from MSD in 1998, while Keith Cartwright, a bacteriologist with the Health Protection Agency, and David Goldblatt, of the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street hospital, reported similar support from Aventis Pasteur. </p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the health spokesman for the Conservatives, said: \"It would be far better if decisions about vaccines and their use by the NHS were made in the same way as decisions on other medicines, ie with an independent appraisal from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice).\"</p> <p>Such a suggestion is unlikely to cut any ice with the government. Nice does not pass judgement on safety, which is the responsibility of regulatory agencies in both Britain and Europe.</p> <p>Nice spotlights effectiveness and value-for-money within the NHS and it has public consultations during the process. Ministers would have no wish for vaccine sceptics to challenge policy within such a framework. In addition, vaccine policy is determined for the UK as a whole, not just in England and Wales, where Nice's remit runs.</p>",
  "Venezuela's election authorities struggled to retain control of the country's controversial recall poll yesterday in the face of a massive turnout and delays caused by new technology and absent polling staff. <p>Around 80% of the country's 14 million registered voters took part in the referendum to decide whether to recall the president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>By midday both sides were privately claiming victory, but a decision to keep polling stations open for an extra four hours meant an official announcement was not expected until the morning. </p> <p>Mr Ch\u00e1vez will step down immediately and new elections will be held within 30 days if those who answer yes in the referendum gain more votes than he won when he was elected in 1998, and also win a majority on the day. </p> <p>If the no votes gain the majority, Mr Ch\u00e1vez has promised he will invite his opponents to lunch at the presidential palace. </p> <p>Shortly before 3pm the president of the national election council, Francisco Carrasquero, appeared on television to play a faked recording of his own voice announcing that Mr Ch\u00e1vez had been defeated and was stepping down with immediate effect. </p> <p>Calling the recording a \"flagrant crime\" which \"pretends to make fun of the will of the people\", he announced the launch of an investigation. </p> <p>The investigation did not take long: it emerged that the recording is a popular spoof sold at street markets. The discovery did little for the credibility of the electoral council. </p> <p>Earlier, as it became clear that the average voter had to stand in line for seven hours to vote, Mr Carrasquero absolved his organisation of the blame for the delays. </p> <p>\"Those who are responsible are the [polling station machine] operators who did not turn up. It seems that some of them were paid not to go,\" he said. </p> <p>Opposition groups pointed to the hi-tech machinery - including electronic voting machines and a more advanced version of the fingerprint recognition system used by US immigration authorities - as being responsible for the delay. </p> <p>The massive turnout was spurred by campaigners on both sides waking their supporters at 3am yesterday with electric horns, bugles and firecrackers. </p> <p>At noon Mr Ch\u00e1vez voted in a working-class Caracas neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"We are very happy,\" he said. \"Today is a very happy day. This is a people in peace giving an example to the rest of the world. The rumours of violence and fraud have been carried away by the winds of reality.\" </p> <p>He dismissed fears that a victory for him might provoke a coup. \"That is now impossible in Venezuela,\" he said. \"The people are too awake. We now have a democracy that is reactivated and full of life.\" </p> <p>By 5am many polling stations in the capital had queues of several hundred people waiting patiently outside. Inside the Colegio Las Acacias, one of 26 polling stations serving the 54,000 residents of the middle-class neighbourhood of San Pedro, observers from the two sides struggled with a roll of sticky tape as they attempted to assemble flat-pack ballot boxes to hold the paper votes. </p> <p>Olivia G\u00fazman, standing outside in the line reserved for pensioners, said: \"You have to be patient. We can do this little by little. I'm not really political but this government has forced me to take more interest. We're in a pit. I've never seen this country in such a bad state. The politicians know that this is a time for reflection and a time for change, for them as much as for anyone.\" </p> <p>In one of the city's com-mercial areas, La Candelaria, hundreds waited to vote at the Colegio Andr\u00e9s Bello. </p> <p>Ra\u00fal Urquia, bearing a purple stain from having his fingerprint taken, was impressed with the system. </p> <p>\"This is much better than anything we've seen before,\" he said. \"This referendum marks a defeat for the coup plotters and for those who think that oil is more important than people.\" </p> <p>Unlike the rest of the tense and acrimonious campaign, the early stages of election day in Caracas were marked by good humour and tolerance. </p> <p>There was a sense among voters that the referendum was an opportunity to give expression to the belief that, far from being a focus for civil unrest and intolerance, the country could reassert itself as a modern, mature democracy. </p> <p>\"All we want is for today to pass peacefully, in complete calm,\" said Carmen Hernandez, queuing outside the polling station at the Asociaci\u00f3n de Mujeres in San Pedro as dawn broke. \"We're not political fanatics, we're responsible citizens. This is a time for change, but within a spirit of reconciliation, a time for Venezuelans to win democracy.\" </p> <p>When former US president Jimmy Carter and former Colombian president C\u00e9sar Gaviria visited La Candelaria in their capacities as heads of the Carter Center and the Organisation of American States respectively, voters burst out in applause. </p> <p>Speaking above the din, Mr Gaviria said: \"We've been across the country and we have not come across any incidents that cause us concern. People are coming in massive numbers to vote, many more than we expected. Finally, this country is going to find what it has been looking for - the political conflicts can be solved through electoral means.\"</p>",
  "<p>Whatever the outcome of this evening's pinnacle in the pool, one thing is guaranteed: between them, Australia's Ian \"Thorpedo\" Thorpe and America's superfish Michael Phelps will once again have made swimming matter in a way that could transform the fortunes of the sport. </p> <p>Rivalry between swimming's giants might climax in the 105 or so seconds it will take them to complete the 200 metres freestyle but its legacy will be much longer lasting. What these two bring to the pool with their enormous physiques and phenomenal ability is the hype, hysteria and razzle-dazzle rarely associated with their sport. </p> <p>Phelps and Thorpe remain anomalies in international swimming. Each is reportedly a multi-millionaire; both have endorsements coming out of their ears. Since his haul of three golds and a silver medal in Sydney Thorpe's A-list superstar status has endured to the extent that, fittingly, he felt the need for bodyguards at the 2001 world championships and launched his own range of pearl jewellery on the back of his celebrity. He has presented television programmes, is an ambassador for the designer Giorgio Armani's collections and his love of fashion has made him a gay icon - all, it must be said, very David Beckham. </p> <p>Phelps, meanwhile, won his first Olympic title only on Saturday but nonetheless has amassed sponsorship deals worth an estimated $2m (\u00a31.1m) with Visa, Omega, PowerBar and others who see dollar signs flashing in his potential. Already, at 19, he drives a Cadillac Escalade and gave his mother a Mercedes for Christmas. </p> <p>In America his influence is such that Pete's Grill, the Baltimore equivalent of a transport cafe where he eats his post-training breakfast, has become a tourist hot spot. And lucrative offers are still pouring in. Amid much publicity Speedo has promised Phelps an automatic bonus of $1m if the American equals Mark Spitz's seven golds from a single games. </p> <p>Whether or not he achieves what many believe to be an unattainable goal is, in many ways, irrelevant. Merely by declaring his intention to try for eight medals Phelps is helping Thorpe to change our perceptions both of the sport and of what it means to be a world-class swimmer. If their achievements come anywhere near to matching the pre-Olympic hype, then the opportunities could be limitless. And the bigger the splash this pair makes the better the commercial outlook for Britain's potential pool medallists who could be among those to benefit from the sport being catapulted to a new level. </p> <p>Usually, for all but the most dedicated fan, swimming splashes into our consciousness once every four years. It bursts out of its shell for the Olympics when its stars are lavished with the kind of attention we usually reserve for footballers and athletes. But when the games are over its popularity dwindles, its profile evaporates. Most of the time it floats along in anonymity. Even Phelps has bemoaned the fact that, outside Australia, other elite swimmers find they are way down the pecking order when it comes to attracting corporate support. \"You don't see a swimmer doing a Sprite commercial\" is how he puts it. And, if they did, then most of us would not recognise them anyway. </p> <p>Realistically, though, all that could change after Athens. Not only does swimming now possess larger-than-life superstars to rival those in track and field but its image is less tarnished. True, the sport has almost drowned in controversy in the past. Who can forget the Irish sensation Michelle de Bruin who won three golds and a bronze in Atlanta, only to be outed as a drugs cheat months down the line? Or the sight of the far too beefy looking East German women at the 1976 Olympics? </p> <p>It may never be as pure as driven snow - what sport is? - yet swimming's public reputation remains relatively intact. Certainly it threatens to leave athletics and its endless drug-ridden scandals in its wake this year. </p> <p>But it promises so much more, too. At 5.45 BST this afternoon it is the race itself and all the attention it brings that could do far more for swimming than the sum of its major parts.</p>",
  "<p>Informing an American there is more to life than winning has always been one of the world's most pointless conversations. For Ian Thorpe to do just that before the most hyped-up race in the Olympic pool was a cue for widespread bewilderment. What next? A seminar with George W Bush about the dangers of climate change? </p> <p>Tonight's final of the 200m freestyle pits Thorpe against the American wonderkid Michael Phelps. In an atmosphere of slavering expectation, enough to fill a 50m pool of its own, Thorpe chose to offer a passable impression of Baron de Coubertin by talking of the importance of friendship and fair play. Then, to add to the confusion, he omitted to name Phelps as one of his chief challengers for the 200m crown. America senses a snub.</p> <p>Either Thorpe is engaged in a clever psychological ploy, seeking to confuse Phelps's single-minded ambition, or the world's greatest swimmer is seeking a broader Olympic experience that tells of his creeping vulnerability, a man tiring of his obsession. At 5.43pm British time tonight we shall discover more.</p> <p>Phelps's first gold, in the 400m individual medley, came with a world record of 4min 08.26sec and an obligatory rallying cry of \"one down and six to go\", so feeding the United States' delusion that he might equal Mark Spitz's Olympic record of seven golds. He skipped out of the pool with no sign of fatigue and said: \"I'm dedicating this to myself.\" For Thorpe, such days of simplicity may never return.</p> <p>His opening gold, over 400m freestyle, to add to the three that he won as a 17-year-old in Sydney, brought sobs of relief after a swim which he described as \"terrible\". This was the race that he almost did not swim - he was disqualified in the Australian trials after a false start and was only reinstated after his close friend and team-mate Craig Stevens selflessly stood down - and he bore the excess emotion heavily.</p> <p>He was visibly exhausted when he hauled himself out of the pool about 20 minutes after Phelps, having barely held off the challenge of his Australian team-mate Grant Hackett. But not so exhausted that he could not preach about the deeper significance of Olympic competition.</p> <p>\"I have made sure during these Olympic Games that I get it,\" Thorpe said. \"It is not just about competing and winning medals. It is about sharing the Olympic experience with your friends. I have had a wonderful experience here because one of my friends allowed me to do it. That is a greater experience than winning itself.\"</p> <p>The differences between Thorpe and Phelps, the teenager who would take his crown, continue to intrigue. Neither attended the opening ceremony. But in the Olympic village Thorpe watched the proceedings on television whereas Phelps viewed a film about how the United States ice hockey team beat the Soviet Union at Lake Placid in 1980. It sent him to sleep within half an hour, which is not much of a review.</p> <p>Phelps is one American shrewd enough to know that tonight's 200m final does not stop at Thorpe. \"You have an Olympic champion in Pieter van den Hoogenband and an ex-world record holder in Grant Hackett,\" he said. \"But I have always wanted to race Thorpe in a freestyle event before either of us retires.\"</p> <p>Perhaps Thorpe's retirement will come sooner than Australia expects. His new coach Tracey Menzies is no hard taskmaster but allows him to set his own schedules and make his own rules.</p> <p>Thorpe, like Phelps, mentioned who he thought were his greatest challengers tonight and, pressed to justify his naming of only Hackett and Van den Hoogenband, said: \"I like Michael and he is one of the most talented athletes I have seen. My warning is that anything short of Spitz's record will be seen as failure, whereas we should be judging him on his own performances.\"</p> <p>Last night's windswept semi-finals revealed little: Van den Hoogenband qualified fastest in 1min 46.00sec and Thorpe held Phelps in the second semi-final by nearly half a second.</p> <p>There was British satisfaction, too, as the 21-year-old Simon Burnett tore nearly a second from his personal best to qualify sixth fastest. He now trains in the United States and his closest friend in swimming is the South African Lyndon Ferns, who last night won gold in the 100m freestyle relay.</p>"
