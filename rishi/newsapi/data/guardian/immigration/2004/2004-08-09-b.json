  "As a former soldier and a leading member of his local Pakistani community, Mahmood Hussain carries enormous credibility with Muslim voters. So when the soft-spoken 56-year-old warns that his beloved Labour party faces a battle to win back Muslims in Luton, Downing Street should take notice. <p>\"I was opposed to the Iraq war, I was not convinced by Tony Blair and considered leaving the Labour party,\" said Mr Hussain, who knows about the horrors of war after being wounded during the 1965 India-Pakistan conflict. A Labour member for 37 years and now chairman of his constituency party, he joined the party within a month of arriving in Britain after being thrown into a Pakistani jail for protesting against the 1965 war. Mr Hussain eventually decided to stay with the party he has supported for so long. </p> <p>Others have not, as Labour found out last year when all three Labour councillors in Biscot were unseated by Muslim Liberal Democrat candidates. \"The voters will punish Labour. This could be another Leicester South [where the Lib Dems went from third to first place in a recent byelection],\" says Qurban Hussain, a former Labour councillor who spearheaded the Lib Dem assault in Biscot, a deprived ward where 60% of voters are Asian. </p> <p>Labour should - in normal times - look forward to holding the two seats of Luton South and Luton North. The party won both of them from the Conservatives in 1997 and retained them at the last general election with well over half the vote. Labour knows, though, that Luton's voters have changed sides regularly over the past 50 years, backing the winning party at every general election since 1951. And these are anything but normal times in a town where Muslims, who form a sizeable majority of the town's ethnic minority population, will play a decisive role in the election. </p> <p>To complicate the picture, Luton's two Labour MPs took opposing views on the war. Margaret Moran, the loyalist MP for Luton South, voted in favour of the conflict. Kelvin Hopkins, the rebellious MP for Luton North, should feel more comfortable because he voted against the war. </p> <p>But Mahmood Hussain sounded a warning note. \"I stood in Kelvin's area during the local elections. We told voters we had both opposed the war. I lost because voters said: 'But you are part of the Labour party.'\" </p> <p>Against this background, Labour is undertaking a huge effort to try to persuade Muslim voters that the government provides the best hope for a town which has struggled to cope with the closure of much of its industry despite new employers such as the booming local airport. Ministers hope that Labour's record investment in public services will appeal to Muslims, many of whom have struggled to find work after being attracted to Luton in the early 1970s by jobs at the Vauxhall and Bedford car plants. </p> <p>As part of Labour's campaign, Robin Cook used a visit to Luton's Central Mosque to urge Muslims to stick with Labour even though he shared their opposition to the war. </p> <p>For many Muslims, this is an unacceptable attempt to dismiss the defining event of their lives. As he left lunchtime prayers at the central mosque, Mahmud Ahmad said: \"I respect Robin Cook but I do not agree with him about voting Labour.\" </p> <p>Mr Ahmad, 40, who is married with five children, said he is deeply angered by the targeting of his community by police, who arrested a man in the town last week. </p> <p>\"It is like the Soviet Union,\" he said. \"I am a British citizen. I have a beard and am a different colour but I have done everything according to the law. And yet I am suffering. I go for job interviews and do not get the job even though I have the qualifications. I am a devout person but I am not a terrorist.\" </p> <p>His remarks show the depth of feeling in Biscot, where Muslims shop in Halal butchers and DVD stores sell the latest films from Pakistan. The challenge facing Labour is demonstrated by a poster in the Al Madina superstore which declares: \"Countdown to the deceptive handover of sovereignty in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Fida Bukhari, a Labour voter since the 1970s, said he was jumping ship to the Tories. A successful local businessman, Mr Bukhari said: \"My wife and I are walking away from Labour. I think all Muslims are the same. Michael Howard has a credible position because he says that he would not have supported the war if he had known there would be no weapons of mass destruction.\" </p> <p>Others take a more charitable view of Labour. Akbar Dad Khan, of the Building Bridges group, believes that Muslims will continue to vote Labour, though they will do so with a \"heavy heart\". </p> <p>Speaking in the courtyard of the mosque, where his three young sons played catch after evening classes, Mr Khan said: \"Traditionally Muslims have voted Labour for 40 years. A large part of the Muslim community is not happy with Tony Blair but it recognises that for the sake of their own betterment the Labour party is their natural home.\" </p> <p>Labour strategists believe the results of June's European election bear this out. Labour topped the poll in Luton and the Lib Dems were a distant third. The Tories came well behind Labour. </p> <p>Labour also believes it has caught the Lib Dems playing the race card. In an echo of the row over the distribution of different leaflets to Asian and white communities in Leicester South, Labour has seized on a decision by the Lib Dem-controlled council to move the predominantly white ward of Round Green from an area committee which contained the largely Asian Biscot ward. Mahmood Hussain said: \"They haven't done it in racism terms but it is very close it.\" </p> <p>Highlighting such tactics may be paying off. As he rushed home after evening prayers, a respected member of the community said he would be standing by Labour. Shamsul Haque, 72, said: \"Labour. It's always Labour.\"</p>",
  "As one of those Labour members that Neal Lawson and Paul Thompson say will have ceased to exist by 2018 (The stakes are too high, August 9), I would like to ask them how they spent last Sunday morning. Did they, like me, join their local councillors in the blazing sun on a canvass of local streets, speaking to residents, listening to their views, dealing with complaints, collecting case work and pointing out the ineptitude of their Lib Dem-Tory council? Or composing another self-satisfied anti-Blair, anti-American rant, long on complaint but short on solutions, destined to give support and succour to those same Lib Dems and Tories? <p>Like many activists, I am sick of armchair revolutionaries shouting from the sidelines about how awful the party is and longing for the safe days of opposition when we could work up a righteous sweat at a demo that felt fantastic, but achieved nothing. It is just this type of politics - obsessed with process rather than outcome, mired in dogma rather than adjusting socialism to the realities of the 21st century and hell bent on unleashing friendly fire rather than aiming at our real enemies - that so nauseated me when I was a member of the SWP. </p> <p>I finally left the Trots because I realised that all my years of simplistic, feel-good politicising did not help build one new hospital, or lift one child out of poverty, or educate one new doctor, or renovate one new social-housing complex, or help one asylum seeker fleeing persecution, or defend one local day-care centre from closure. All of these I have done since becoming a Labour activist. </p> <p>If Lawson and Thompson are so gloomy about the state of the party and are nostalgic for the days of scraping 27% in general elections, may I advise them to look for another party: one that is obsessed with Iraq, is not troubled with 21st-century realities and is never going to form a government and have to take tough decisions. I hear that the Lib Dems and Respect are still touting for members.<br><b>Matthew Salter </b><br>Streatham CLP </p> <p>I share the pessimism. I am more positive about the government's record and New Labour's legacy, but the key is the erosion of trust. We may win the next election under Tony Blair's leadership, but it would be a hollow victory, based on Tory weakness, not an endorsement of Labour. </p> <p>Liverpool Riverside CLP, of which I am secretary, holds events - from \"big conversations\" to all-member meetings. But our membership has nearly halved since 1997 and the only ward meeting is my own. We are in better shape than many other CLPs. </p> <p>If you believe markets and management alone can deliver results, this does not matter. This I take to be the view of the prime minister and his aides, but not I hope most of the cabinet or the NEC. If a New Labour- supporting councillor from a loyalist CLP, like myself, is desperate for a change at the top of the party, imagine what the mood is elsewhere. </p> <p>Tony Blair has made clear his intention to continue in office during a third term. It would be wrong, if not impossible, to force a change of leadership shortly after an election victory. If the party does not change leader and course now, the outlook is bleak. Time is running out to restore a sense of purpose to the Labour government, revive the party and trust in politics.<br><b>Cllr Steve Munby</b> <br>Liverpool Riverside CLP </p> <p>Last month's Guardian ICM poll showed that only 10% of Labour voters want a leadership change before the general election. Lawson and Thompson would serve the party better by coming up with some concrete policy proposals for a third term.<br><b>Luke Akehurst</b><br> Hackney North CLP  <b>Dan Neidle</b><br> Islington South CLP</p>",
  "<p>Oil group <strong>BP</strong> lagged behind rival <strong>Shell</strong> yesterday amid fears that Britain's biggest quoted company will be forced to stop buying its own shares this month. </p> <p>BP has one of the most aggressive buyback programmes in the London market. It has acquired 380m shares at a cost of $3.25bn (\u00a31.8bn) this year and since reporting interim figures at the end of last month stepped up the size of its purchases from 5.5m to 11m a day. </p> <p>Along with the buoyant oil price, those buybacks have helped to support the BP share price, which last week hit 520p - its highest level since August 2002. </p> <p>Analysts at German investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein believe, however, that BP is contractually obliged to put the programme on ice for 30 days from August 21. </p> <p>This is because during that period BP is due to make the first of three annual payments of $1.25bn in stock to Alfa Group and Access-Renova, the partners in its Russian joint venture, TNK-BP. </p> <p>Dresdner reckons the enforced pause in the buyback programme could not come at a worse time for BP because the consortium of banks which are to take delivery of the stock on behalf of Alfa and Access will try to hedge their exposure. </p> <p>This could see the banks short about 7m BP shares each day over the 30-day period. </p> <p>\"We believe that BP shares have benefited from the recent step up in the buyback programme. This could reverse if we see the recent 11m daily withdrawal turned into a 6.7m injection,\" Dresdner said. </p> <p>BP shares closed 1.75p higher at 501.25p, while Shell climbed 5.25p to 394p, the day's best performance by a blue chip stock. </p> <p>In the wider market, concerns about the US economy and the outcome of today's meeting of the US Federal Reserve saw leading shares extend their losses over the past two sessions to nearly 100 points. </p> <p>The final scores showed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> index down 23.5 points at 4314.4. The <strong>FTSE 250</strong> dropped 51.9 points to 5834.4, while the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index eased 11 points to 2436.0. </p> <p>Trading volumes were lacklustre with about 2.4bn shares changing hands as many investors refused to play ball ahead of the Fed meeting, at which the chairman, Alan Greenspan, is expected to increase rates by a quarter of a point. </p> <p>In the bond market, gilts also closed lower, unsettled by a report showing industrial pricing pressures building up. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 100.320, yielding 4.959%. </p> <p><strong>Wm Morrison</strong>, the new owner of Safeway, was among the day's biggest blue chip fallers after a large chunk of stock was unloaded into the market. </p> <p>Morrisons house broker, ABN Amro, handled the business, taking on 23m shares from an institutional client at 174p before parcelling them out to hedge funds and fund managers at the same price. Morrisons shares closed 6.5p adrift at 171.25p, their lowest level since March 2003. </p> <p>Fund management group <strong>Amvescap</strong> eased a further 3.75p to 261.25p, an 18-month low, on concerns that it will breach its banking covenants if a large fine is imposed on its US operations by the securities and exchange commission. </p> <p>If that happens, dealers believe Amvescap would also require a fund raising. </p> <p>Away from the blue chips, <strong>Benfield</strong>, the reinsurance company, was top dog as rumours of a bid approach resurfaced. The shares rose 8.25p to 233.75p. </p> <p><strong>Icap</strong>, the inter-dealer broker, rallied 4.75p to 208.5p after several large lines of stock, totalling about 5m shares, were cleared. </p> <p>Among the smaller companies, <strong>Filtronic</strong>, the telecoms equipment maker that has halved in value over the past six months, gained 32.5p to 220p as bargain hunters moved in. After its recent fall, Filtronic is reckoned by dealers to be one of the cheapest stocks in its sector. </p> <p><strong>Homestyle</strong>, the home furnishing group, eased 1p to 108p ahead of tomorrow's half- year figures at which the company may give details of its latest shareholder, Formal Property Management Services. </p> <p>The Jersey-based company declared a 5% holding in Homestyle a week ago. Ana lysts also note that FPMS appeared on the share register of Freedom furniture, an Australian furniture retailer, shortly before it received a bid approach last year. </p> <p>On Aim, <strong>AIT Group</strong> slumped 20.25p to 33.25p after the software developer issued a profits warning, blaming the deferral of a big contract and lower than expected sales from clients in the financial services sector. </p> <p>House broker Arbuthnot responded to the news by slashing its 2005 earnings per share forecast from 5.3p to 2.5p. </p> <p><strong>Headway</strong>, the workspace provider which has still to update the market on the bid approach received six months ago, was back in the spotlight. </p> <p>Its shares firmed 1p to 97.5p after Trefick, the investment vehicle of stakebuilder Jack Petchey, announced that it had acquired nearly 15% of the company and had secured an option to buy a further 12.7% at 100p. </p> <p>Trefick will be able to exercise that option on Friday and dealers believe it will do so. They also noted that Trefick had acquired most of its stock from <strong>Country &amp; Metropolitan</strong>, the property developer believed to be behind February's approach. </p> <p><strong>Virotec International</strong> eased 0.75p to 24p despite talk that it is about to strike a deal with the toxic waste clean-up company that entrepreneur John Gunn is planning to bring to Aim this month. </p> <p>According to market gossips, Mr Gunn will inject Virotec's HydroDec Technology into his new stock market vehicle. </p> <p><strong>Discomfort over DFS deal</strong><br></p> <p>DFS eased 0.5p to 440.75p after a leading investment bank advised its clients to reject chairman Lord Kirkham's \u00a3500m deal to take the furniture retailer private. </p> <p>German bank Dresdner reckons the 445p a share bid is inadequate and believes investors should instead push for a radical shake-up of the company. </p> <p>This would include ditching numerous directors, making Lord Kirkham part-time, and returning cash to shareholders. </p> <p>One investor said he would talk with Dresdner about its plan, ahead of formal talks with DFS later this month. </p> <p>However, many shareholders are reluctant to rock the boat because of concerns that Lord Kirkham will retire if the deal is blocked. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham is due to publish his offer document later this week.</p>",
  "A member of Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet yesterday stirred the bitter debate over immigration by declaring that people attempting to enter the country illegally should be \"returned to sender\" en masse before they are allowed to land. <p>The comments from Roberto Calderoli, a member of the Northern League party, were condemned by critics as \"inhumane\" after a boat full of Africans, some close to death, arrived in Syracuse in Sicily. </p> <p>Survivors described how they had to dump the bodies of up to 25 of their fellow immigrants who died during their 15-day ordeal crossing the Mediterranean in a rickety boat from Libya. </p> <p>\"Islamist terrorism is using [Italy's] open door to illegal immigration like an access channel [to Europe], so this door must immediately be closed,\" Italian news agencies quoted Mr Calderoli as saying. </p> <p>Mr Calderoli has been the minister of reform since the Northern League's famously anti-immigration leader, Umberto Bossi, left the government for the European parliament last month. </p> <p>\"If we do not remove the cause of the problem [of terrorists entering the country among illegal immigrants],\" Mr Calderoli said, getting rid of terrorists would be like \"trying to empty the sea with a teaspoon\". </p> <p>Mr Calderoli said anyone \"good or bad\" trying to get into the country illegally should be \"returned to sender\" and anyone living illegally on Italian soil should be immediately expelled. </p> <p>\"This is just good sense, not racism,\" Mr Calderoli said. \"Everyone has the right to legitimate defence, especially when it is preventive in the face of such precise threats as we have received in recent days.\" </p> <p>The minister was referring to repeated internet and newspaper threats Italy has received over the past two weeks, supposedly from the extremist Abu Hafs Brigades, threatening to bring \"unbearable hell\" to Italy if it does not withdraw its troops from Iraq by Sunday. </p> <p>His comments are part of a campaign by the Northern League to toughen up the way Italy deals with illegal immigrants, mainly from the north coast of Africa, who appear to be choosing Italy over Malta, Spain or Portugal as the easiest way into Europe. </p> <p>The minister later said he was not referring specifically to the boatload of exhausted, dehydrated Africans who were rescued on Sunday and taken to safety, some close to death and one dying on the way. But opposition politicians condemned the remarks. </p> <p>\"They [the Northern League] would even shoot at dead people if they could,\" said a Green Party member, Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio. </p> <p>The arrival of the boat full of Africans, who said they were from Sudan, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone, raised more moderate calls for help from the interior minister, Giuseppe Pisanu, who called for increased international cooperation to tackle the illegal immigration problem. </p> <p>All 73 survivors of the latest immigration tragedy were receiving health and social service care yesterday. Two men among them, reported to be of Liberian origin, were arrested for possibly organising the cargo, taking up to \u20ac1,800 (\u00a31,200) for each person for a place in the boat. </p> <p>The Italian government recently estimated that there may be up to 2 million would-be immigrants waiting near Libya's shores, where smugglers keep them in sheds until a rickety boat is ready for departure. </p> <p>The Libyan government has not confirmed these reports.</p>",

  "<p>Sir Clive Woodward has targeted the man at the centre of the most successful Lions tours as he prepares for next summer's trip to New Zealand. </p> <p>Former Scotland coach Ian McGeechan is a Lions legend after triumphs in Australia and then world champions South Africa in 1989 and 1997 respectively, and Woodward has identified him as a key player for his coaching staff.</p> <p>The current Scottish Rugby Union director of rugby stepped away from the head coaching role last autumn to allow Matt Williams take up his mantle. </p> <p>Since then, McGeechan has been working alongside SRU chief executive Phil Anderton in a bid to improve the image of the game north of the border. </p> <p>But the SRU have admitted that World Cup-winner Woodward is in early negotiations with the ex-Scotland international to come onboard with the Lions. </p> <p>The England coach has been in contact with SRU chiefs to grant the country's current director of rugby a temporary release from his duties. </p> <p>But the Murrayfield hierarchy have not yet made a decision about letting McGeechan become part of the Lions' squad. </p> <p>An SRU spokesman said: \"There is informal dialogue at the moment but no decision has been taken.\" </p> <p>McGeechan is the only British coach to have led the Lions on three successive tours but turned down the chance to take charge of trip to Australia three years ago. </p> <p>He led the Lions to series wins against the Wallabies and Springboks, and in 1993 his side came close to beating New Zealand when they lost the series 2-1.</p> <p>McGeechan also has the added advantage of experiencing a Lions tour from both sides after playing with the team in 1974 and 1977. </p> <p>Woodward is set to name a travelling party of 70 for the gruelling tour of New Zealand, with 44 players and 26 support staff on the plane. </p> <p>But it is widely anticipated that the England boss will take five or six coaches with him for the anticipated clash against former Lions coach Graham Henry's Kiwi team.</p> <p>Llanelli Scarlets' coach, Gareth Jenkins, who was surprisingly overlooked for the Wales national team job when Mike Ruddock was appointed after Steve Hansen left, is also tipped to add his experience to the party. </p> <p>The Lions have confirmed 10 games in total in New Zealand, with another match expected to be added shortly along with the three Tests in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.</p>",
  "<p><strong>LEE HUGHES JAILED FOR SIX YEARS</strong></p> <p>The West Bromich Albion striker Lee Hughes has been jailed for six years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Coventry crown court. The jury took just 90 minutes to convict Hughes, 28, of Meriden in the West Midlands, at the end of a six-day trial. Hughes ploughed his super-charged Mercedes sports coupe into another car near his home last November, killing a father-of-four who was travelling in the back, before fleeing the scene on foot.</p> <p>Relatives of Mr Graham, 56, who included his wife Maureen and two sons and daughters, greeted the verdict with cries of \"Yes!\" and burst into tears. The footballer bit his lip but showed no other signs of emotion, while his wife, Anna, sitting just two rows in front of the Graham family in the public gallery, wept. Mrs Graham, 50, later described the impact of the loss of her husband. \"Something has been taken away from my family that can never be replaced,\" she said. \"We can only hope that the person involved will acknowledge what he has done.\"</p> <p>Earlier the nine men and three women jurors were urged not to \"allow fame or fortune or wealth\" to influence their decision. Summing up, Judge Hodson told the panel that they were entitled to draw an \"adverse inference\" from Hughes's refusal to explain where he was in the 36 hours after the crash before he turned himself in at a Coventry police station. He said the jurors also had to consider whether or not Hughes ran away from the scene of the collision because he was over the limit at the time - though he insisted that he had drunk just two whiskies at two local pubs. West Brom responded to the verdict by cancelling Hughes' contract with immediate effect.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Everybody within the club feels we have the quality to challenge for a top-six place\" - Manchester City striker Antoine Sibierski really hasn't learned a lot from working under Kevin Keegan, has he?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>KEEPING IT REAL</strong></p> <p>Every night, Arsene Wenger has a recurring dream in which Patrick Vieira is boarding a flight to Madrid.

  "<p>A crackdown on fraudulent applications for visas from China is barring legitimate students from entering Britain and could leave universities \u00a370m short this year, EducationGuardian.co.uk has learned. </p> <p>The British Embassy in China has tightened up its student visa process to weed out fraudulent applications, but universities claim this is barring other students from taking up their place this Autumn. The moves threatens a pledge - backed by the prime minister - to get more international students into British universities. </p> <p>UK visas, the cross-government agency which deals with applications, confirmed that they have tightened up the process to stop people applying for a visa to come to the UK to study in order to gain work. \"There has been no change in policy but we have strengthened our consideration process and that's in response to evidence of serious abuse,\" said a spokesperson. </p> <p>According to Universities UK, which represents university bosses, a \"significant\" number of universities are reporting widespread failure to secure visas for their students. </p> <p>At Luton University, where 1,800 Chinese students confirmed a place for this Autumn, the vice-chancellor Professor Les Ebdon said that their success rate for getting visas had fallen from 70% last year to 30% this year. Based on their decrease in applications, he has calculated that up to 10,000 students could be barred from Britain this year compared with last. With the median fee for an overseas student being \u00a37,700, the sector stands to lose \u00a377m, he claimed.</p> <p>Professor Ebdon said that the university believed the crackdown was in response to the tragedy in Morecambe Bay where 21 Chinese cockle-pickers were drowned in February. \"While I understand the national concern after the Morecambe bay tragedy there's no evidence that the people there came on student visas.\"</p> <p>The tightening up of the visa rules is believed to have come into effect on May 6. </p> <p>However, after a chance meeting with David Blunkett at an event at the university last month where Professor Ebdon explained their situation, their success rate subsequently returned to last year's levels. </p> <p>But he said that the problems had \"caused a lot of angst. </p> <p>\"When a Chinese student applies to come here it's an enormous sacrifice just to get the money, the fees are substantial, to get that money is a major effort.\"</p> <p>University bosses are adamant that legitimate students are being barred from taking up their university place this Autumn. Some of Luton's students who were turned down should have been taking the last two years of a degree jointly awarded by Luton and their home institution. A Leeds University programme which has brought up to 100 Chinese students from Heilongjiang University in the city of Harbin, northern China, for the last five years saw 78 of its 81 applicants refused a visa. </p> <p>David Baker, head of the international centre at the university, said: \"There has been no history of leakage out of this programme to illegal immigration. </p> <p>\"It's caused us a lot of concern. We sent a staff member out to talk to the embassy and the university.\"</p> <p>Middlesex University, which claims to have the largest number of international students of any institution in the UK, is also reporting problems securing visas. Professor Steven Lei, head of Middlesex University's recruitment offices in China, speaking from Beijing, said that the main problem students were facing was being able to prove to immigration officials that they can afford the fees for their chosen university. </p> <p>\"The British embassy want to know where the money comes from but the parents can't always prove that, it makes it very difficult for the embassy to verify how much they earn.\" Some parents don't receive pay slips, and in other cases it might be a whole community funding the trip, he explained. </p> <p>Middlesex University was one of the first to insist that students pay 50% of their fees as a deposit to make sure they are finding their way to the university. </p> <p>The spokesperson for UK visas said that overall the success rate for Chinese students had fallen 7% year on year. \"All we're doing is seeking to deter bogus applications coming into the country.\"</p> <p>According to the British Council, last year 31,930 Chinese nationals came to study in British universities - more than double that of the next biggest delegations from a single country, America's 14,365. Higher Education Statistics Agency figures for the same year reveal that fees from students outside of the European Union are worth \u00a3875m to universities for a total of 184,685 students. Unlike fees for home and EU students, universities are allowed to charge what they like for international students. They are the single most flexible source of funding for cash-strapped universities. In 1998 Tony Blair backed a campaign to increase the number of students coming to the UK. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills, which is spearheading the universities' drive to recruit more overseas students, said: \"We welcome international students in our universities and colleges, including those from China. However, decisions on visa applications are matters for UK visas.\"</p>",
  "Unswerving defender of Fidel Castro and Latin American literary patriarch he may be, but Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez appears to have finally succumbed to Hollywood's call, signing over the film rights to Love in the Time of Cholera. <p>The Los Angeles production company Stone Village Pictures is reportedly paying the Colombian Nobel laureate between one and three million dollars to make a movie of what producer Scot Steindorff recently termed \"the best love story ever told, next to Romeo and Juliet\". </p> <p>Despite selling millions of books around the globe, the 76-year-old novelist, who is battling with cancer, is said to be worried about the financial future of his lifetime partner Mercedes and their two sons Gonzalo and Rodrigo. </p> <p>Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who has lived in Mexico most of the time since 1961, reportedly sank substantial sums into a news magazine called Cambio that he started in Colombia before launching a Mexican version with mixed results. </p> <p>Born in Colombia in 1928, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez spent years as a struggling journalist before making his name crafting fantastic tales told with breathtaking naturalness, often inspired by the lives of his own family and the turbulent history of his native country and continent. </p> <p>He shot to international literary fame with his 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude, loosely based on the experiences of his own grandparents. In his recent autobiography Bill Clinton described the book as \"the greatest novel in any language since William Faulkner died\". </p> <p>Love in the Time of Cholera, published in 1985, follows the struggles of Florentina Ariza to win the heart of Fermina Daza. It takes the hero 51 years, nine months and four days, but he wins her in the end. </p> <p>The Colombian newspaper El Espectador quoted a triumphant Steindorff as saying it took him two years of constant badgering to persuade the novelist to agree to sell the rights. </p> <p>\"Like the main character in the book I persevered and never lost hope until I achieved my goal. We are going to work very hard to make the most beautiful film Hollywood has ever made.\" </p> <p>The project is an apparent about-turn for Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, a veteran defender of Latin American independence under pressure from successive US regimes intent on imposing their political priorities and cultural trends on the whole hemisphere. </p> <p>The novelist has remained fiercely loyal to Fidel Castro, even after many others on the left distanced themselves from the Cuban leader because of his apparently indiscriminate crackdown on dissidents and political use of the death penalty. Last year this issue drew Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez into a bitter polemic with Susan Sontag, who publicly lambasted the author for not criticizing his old friend. </p> <p>Up to now Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has always resisted the temptation to allow high-budget English language films of his work. The most commercial adaptation of his books to hit the screen so far was the 1987 Italian version of Chronicle of a Death Foretold, directed by Francesco Rosi and starring Rupert Everett. </p> <p>Details of who may direct or star in the movie have yet to be released, although the names of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are already circulating. Steindorff himself has reportedly hinted that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez could be persuaded to write the screenplay.</p>",

Salem Chalabi, who as head of the Iraqi Special Tribunal is responsible for organising the trial of Saddam Hussein, was named as a suspect for the June murder of the director-general of the finance ministry.</p> <p>Ahmed Chalabi is accused of counterfeiting Iraqi dinars, which were removed from circulation after the fall of Saddam. He has promised to return to Iraq from Iran, says the FT, to face the charges. His nephew, currently in London, also plans to go back to clear his name.</p> <p>The move is a \"fresh blow to a dynasty with close former links to the Bush administration\", says the Independent.</p> <p>The issuing of the warrants also happens to coincide with the restoration of the death penalty in Iraq - which is what Salem Chalabi would face if he were convicted of murder.</p> <p>The return of capital punishment for the most serious crimes is a measure aimed at helping the interim government deal with the continuing insurgency, particularly in Najaf, where the forces of Moqtada al-Sadr continue their rebellion.</p> <p>A \"disturbing element\" of the battle for Najaf, says the Times in its leader, is Iranian \"intrigue\". \"The Iranian leadership claims it cannot control the deeds of volunteers [who are suspected of crossing the border to join the insurgency in Iraq]\", but \"there are strong reasons to suspect official involvement is far more substantial than has been admitted\".</p> <p>But, argues the Guardian, \"beyond the shadowy politics of interim Iraq, there is a too easily forgotten ongoing human tragedy.

That is the question at the heart of the Telegraph's front page piece today on Washington's defence of its decision to \"prematurely leak\" the names of arrested militants.</p> <p>The Bush administration has \"come out fighting\" after criticism - not least from Britain's home secretary David Blunkett - that it caused a needless panic when it announced the seizure of computer files containing al-Qaida intelligence on possible bombing targets.</p> <p>Democrats also accused the White House of playing \"election year politics\" with the information, says the paper. </p> <p>But Washington reacted by \"disclosing still more data\", telling Time magazine about PC disks found in Pakistan contained more than 500 photographs of five financial institutions and \"detailed discussions of how to attack them\".</p> <p>An anonymous military source is quoted as saying that there are, in fact, benefits to spreading panic - providing it affects the terrorists rather than the general population. \"People get flushed out when that happens and they get nervous. As they start to move, they talk and we hear them. It's like hunting birds: you scare 'em up, they run, then you shoot them.\"</p> <p>That's the theory, anyway, but the Telegraph does not seem altogether won over by the argument. Perhaps, as it says in its leader on the subject, Mr Blunkett was right to suggest (in yesterday's Observer) that \"in the United States there is often high-profile commentary followed ... by detailed scrutiny, with the risks of inviting ridicule\".</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mr Blunkett's \"public reticence\" about the war on terror has created \"heated debates about how far the sacrifice of civil liberties is justifiable\".</p> <p>The Mail says Mr Blunkett's comments have raised tensions between London and Washington, and created \"the spectacle of top politicians on both sides of the Atlantic effectively condemning each other's policies\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=YA1MGM21IFXSPQFIQMFCNAGAVCBQYJVC?view=SECURELOGIN&amp;grid=P21&amp;nextPage=/RiK2/wXeR.WZvwF?7wF~/RiK2/s119/1N/14/Kvigg14.7wF!2qZiiv~/UDgvXF/s119/1N/14/e7UDgvXFvDU.ZvwF!2iG3gimiygi2Z~vg3i&amp;resize=null&amp;_requestid=5851\">Telegraph: US hits back in row over terror leaks (login required)</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1279158,00.html\">Brown's photo 'on al-Qaida disks'</a><br></p> <p><b>FRUSTRATION AT INTERNATIONAL INDIFFERENCE TO DARFUR CRISIS</b></p> <p>The Independent devotes its first three pages for the launch of its Darfur Appeal.

This has meant a drop in education and prevention programmes and long waiting times for tests. </p> <p>People at high risk of infection, including prostitutes and injecting drug users, were treated as criminals while the NHS's attitude towards failed asylum seekers needed reviewing. </p> <p>The trust said political leadership, cross-government co-ordination and a respect for human rights were all lacking. It said Britain had failed to honour a commitment made in 2001 to report to the UN on targets regarding HIV issues. </p> <p>There were an estimated 7,000 new cases of HIV infection in Britain last year, taking the total to about 50,000, a third of them undiagnosed. There have been increases in heterosexual transmission, particularly within the African community. </p> <p>Only last week, doctors at sexual health clinics said the Home Office policy of dispersing asylum seekers risked spreading the disease because it could interrupt therapy and compromise care. </p> <p>But there is also mounting unease over planned guidance for GPs that will state that failed asylum seekers will only have free access to free emergency or \"immediately necessary\" treatment. </p> <p>That means they would have to pay for other treatments, such as anti-retroviral drugs, when they are banned from working or receiving benefits. </p> <p>Similar rules limiting access to free treatment for those who have been refused permission to stay in Britain have been introduced for hospitals. </p> <p>Campaigners are furious that the package to prevent \"health tourism\" takes in failed asylum seekers because it could hinder attempts to tackle HIV.</p>",
  "A British scientist who has studied the Chernobyl nuclear disaster for more than 10 years has been placed on the Belarussian KGB's \"forbidden persons list\" and banned from the country for five years. <p>Alan Flowers, a professor at Kingston University, was expelled from the former Soviet republic last weekend, just a few weeks after arriving for a lecture tour on an invitation from the state university. </p> <p>He had regularly conducted studies, testing radioactive content in soil, and had his visa renewed in March to continue his work in the country. </p> <p>Detailing his expulsion for the first time, he told the Guardian that he believed the move was an attempt to gag him by the current Belarussian government, led by the hardline president, Aleksandr Lukashenko. </p> <p>His research could have the potential to embarrass past and present governments. </p> <p>\"They claim to be a democracy and with the Chernobyl research I was working in conjunction with the university, which claims it is dedicated to free and open speech,\" Dr Flowers said. </p> <p>\"But whether it is Stalinist purges in the 1930s or the Soviet reaction to Chernobyl, any detrimental history is not greatly encouraged for consumption of Belarus people. </p> <p>\"It's just not given prominence by the present administration.\" </p> <p>The professor said until his expulsion he had been carrying out his work unimpeded and had not been approached by the authorities at any time with suggestions that he had broken any law. </p> <p>But on the afternoon of July 29, when he went to meet the director of the university, Dr Flowers was greeted by a member of the secret service, which still calls itself the KGB, and one member of the local passport registration office. </p> <p>\"My passport was in order, my visa had been granted in March but they told me I was illegally in the territory of Belarus and must leave.\" </p> <p>When he questioned the order, Dr Flowers was told only that his name was on the blacklist and that he was therefore banned from the country. The official's actions had been in no way threatening, he said, and he had been treated with courtesy and respect. </p> <p>\"A police officer actually apologised to me at the end and asked me if I was completely satisfied with the proceedings,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But at the end of the day, if they decide they don't want you there, you are really just going through the process. The policeman who first took my passport said: 'I do hope, Dr Flowers, that this is a mistake.\"' </p> <p>He was told the decision had been taken by the KGB in consultation with several other authorities, including the interior ministry. </p> <p>The next day he attended the local passport office, and left the country the following Monday. </p> <p>The Foreign Office would say only that it was still awaiting an explanation from the Belarussian government to clarify what had happened. Dr Flowers said it had lodged a protest on his behalf, asking for his visa to be reinstated. </p> <p>For more than 10 years Dr Flowers has taken part in scientific exchanges with academics in Belarus. He says he has always had full cooperation from staff there. </p> <p>But the government has been known to gag outspoken researchers. </p> <p>In 2001, Yuri Bandazhevsky, the country's leading scientist, who had tried to highlight the effects of the Chernobyl disaster on children, was sentenced to eight years in a labour camp after a court found him guilty of taking bribes from students. </p> <p>Newspapers in Moscow reported last week that a Russian broadcasting company had been closed down after a report on a protest against President Lukashenko was deemed \"improper\". </p> <p>Dr Flowers believes his expulsion is a sign of declining academic freedom. \"I haven't changed with what I am doing in the past 10 years but the perception of the Belarus authority has changed towards me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's employers are looking nervously over their shoulders as the European Agency Workers Directive steams towards Westminster. Last week, the CBI was sounding the alarm, anxious that the government might see a rigid application of the directive as a way to mend fences with the unions. The directive, which grants temps rights equal to those enjoyed by permanent colleagues, is now seen as unstoppable. All that remains is to settle how long a period temps must work to qualify for their rights. The TUC thinks a day, the CBI a year. The government is likely to aim for a compromise of six weeks. </p> <p>The CBI estimates that 700,000 are employed as temps, which is an interesting figure, because only a few years ago the recruitment industry estimated that a million temps were at work on any given day. Temps are, of course, notoriously difficult to count. It is not impossible for a temp to occupy the same desk on consecutive days for two different agencies. But 300,000 is hardly a reasonable margin of error. Could the number of temps be shrinking of its own accord? </p> <p>Temping is often credited as the reason why unemployment is lower here than in France and Germany. Temps represent flexibility, a word which is increasingly taking on a different meanings - although whenever it is wielded, people do seem to mean it as a positive thing. Temps allow businesses to expand quickly in the event of a sudden upturn, and allow employers to increase the workforce without committing themselves forever. Nearly a third of all temping assignments are of this nature. Employers and the recruiting industry argue that if businesses do not have this flexibility, they might prefer not to expand at all. </p> <p>Although the stereotype of the temp as a woman office worker does represent a large proportion of agency employees, agency work is also implicated in some of the murkier employment practices that have been building up over the past few years - in particular the use of migrant casual labour in agriculture. Nobody denies that the employment law governing agency workers, originally drafted over 30 years ago, needs revision.</p>",
  "Michael Howard will attempt tomorrow to secure his long-delayed political breakthrough with a keynote speech on crime, including measures to restore respect, end the rights culture and free up police time to deal with persistent offenders. <p>In a speech that has echoes of his tough stance as home secretary in the 90s, Mr Howard will blame the decline in personal responsibility and the growth of a rights culture as contributing to a breakdown of respect in society. </p> <p>He will also argue that the decline in responsibility lies at the heart of the crime increase, and that measures to restore responsibility are the precursor to urban renewal. </p> <p>His speech will be made on a visit to Middlesbrough to meet Ray Mallon, the Mayor of Middlesbrough - the so-called Robocop who has championed zero tolerance of disorder. </p> <p>Mr Mallon specialises in ensuring that the council employs community wardens, litter enforcement officers and traffic wardens who fight against local environmental crimes, freeing up the police to focus on proactive policing to tackle more serious crime. </p> <p>The Tories hope that they will go into the next election with a draw on education and health, but surge ahead on their traditional ground of asylum and crime. </p> <p>In a move away from his old rhetoric of \"prison works\", Mr Howard will say that \"in many ways the police, our courts and the prison service are simply picking up the pieces of other people's failures\". </p> <p>He will argue: \"As a society we are in danger of being overrun by values which eat away at people's respect for themselves, each other, their homes and their neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"Most damaging of all has been the dramatic decline in personal responsibility. Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions. It's someone else's, or something else's fault - the environment, society, the government.\" </p> <p>Although the speech will contain tough new criminal justice measures, Mr Howard will stress that the causes of crime lie in the need to ensure parental responsibility. However, he will be careful to eschew any suggestion that children cannot be parented well outside marriage. </p> <p>\"Children, especially boys, benefit hugely from a male influence in their lives. Of course this isn't always possible because a large number of men simply abandon their responsibilities as fathers.\" </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, will counter with a consultation paper this week setting out plans to give police extra powers to levy duties on publicans and give extra powers to community support officers to detain people for anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>Mr Howard's speech comes as the Tories released a Home Office internal survey showing morale in the immigration and nationality department at rock bottom. </p> <p>The leaked survey of Home Office workers has revealed that only 33% of employees feel that it is safe for them to challenge the way that things are done in Mr Blunkett's department.</p>",
  "As doctors working with asylum seekers we have grave concerns about the government's proposals to restrict failed asylum seekers' access to primary care (see <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk\">www.dh.gov.uk</a>). If these proposals are adopted, failed asylum seekers will only be able to obtain free emergency or \"immediately necessary\" treatment from GPs. They would be expected to pay for all other treatment but, as they are not allowed to claim benefits or to work, they would effectively be excluded from most forms of healthcare. <p>It seems to be assumed that failed asylum seekers are removed from the UK and so do not need healthcare, but this is often not the case - many countries remain too dangerous to return people. </p> <p>Experience in Newcastle indicates that one-third of asylum seekers give a history of torture, while 22% of women give a history of rape. The physical and mental pain caused by these events does not go away when an asylum claim is refused: it frequently intensifies - with a greater need for ongoing support, observation and treatment. </p> <p>It is often very difficult to determine exactly what a person's asylum status is. Yet GPs' receptionists, with no training in complex asylum law, will be expected to decide on this and whether a medical problem is an emergency. This will cause chaos at doctors' receptions. Although treatment for serious infections (except HIV) will remain free, failed asylum seekers will be excluded from GP screening and opportunistic case-finding for conditions such as TB. Similarly, children will not have access to free immunisations and health surveillance. </p> <p>It is also likely the proposals will lead to asylum seekers whose claims are still being considered and members of established ethnic-minority communities facing difficulties. Some healthcare providers have already misunderstood and anticipated changes and there have been cases of \"non-failed\" asylum seekers being refused hospital, GP or dental care to which they are entitled. </p> <p>We believe that these proposals have no evidence base and, if implemented, will lead to inhuman treatment of some of the most vulnerable and excluded members of society. They will ethically compromise health workers. They will lead to chaos in the surgery, will be a threat to public health and will lead to discrimination against other ethnic minorities.

  "The oil-well troubleshooter Paul N \"Red\" Adair, who has died aged 89, was a swashbuckling 20th-century hero, portrayed fittingly on screen by John Wayne, and he probably did more than any other person single-handedly to preserve the environment. The fires he extinguished were so enormous that they threatened to be dangerous contributors to global warming, or the potential causes of intercontinental air pollution disasters. <p>His greatest feat came when he was in his seventies - confronting 117 gigantic oil-well infernos that dominated the horizon in Kuwait, the legacy of Saddam Hussein's departing Iraqi troops after the first Gulf war. Adair and his crews finished putting out the fires in nine months, as opposed to the five years first envisaged, without a single casualty, and indeed the 5ft 7in boss maintained that none of his employees had ever suffered a serious injury while firefighting. </p> <p>As well as a charismatic risk taker, Adair was an astute businessman, creating various enterprises throughout his life. As well as pioneering semi-submersible firefighting vessels and the design of oil derricks deployed in the North Sea, he also contributed to the technical advancement of various marine firefighting boats and water guns. </p> <p>Born in the American oil capital of Houston, Texas, as soon as he could toddle, he witnessed the power of fire in the workshop of his blacksmith father, Charles. But it was a large, poor family, and young Red - so nicknamed for the colour of his hair - left Reagan high school early to take on various jobs before joining the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1936. </p> <p>Two years later he got his first oil job, for the Otis Pressure Control Co in the fields around Houston. Here he learned from the bottom up the skills of extracting \"black gold\" from the earth. When the US joined the war after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Adair served in the 139th Bomb Disposal Squad, and rose to staff sergeant. His work on unexploded shells and bombs in Japan taught him two skills that would serve him well later: how to utilise and control explosives safely, and how to keep a cool head under extreme pressure and danger. </p> <p>He returned to Houston after the war and went to work with Myron Kinley, who had established the techniques of oil-well blowout and fire control. He stayed with Kinley for 14 years before forming his own Red Adair Co, where he perfected the methods for controlling \"wild wells\". At the same time, he developed a flamboyant public persona, capitalising on his nickname with bright red firefighting uniforms and helmets, a red logo, and red accoutrements, replicas of which he would later sell to fans. </p> <p>He and his crews were soon averaging 42 fires a year, extinguished or controlled, all over the world, inland and at sea. The Adair teams completed more than 1,000 assignments internationally through using explosives and drilling mud and concrete. In 1968 the film Hellfighters came out, with Wayne starring as Adair. </p> <p>Adair scored numerous firsts in conquering oil-well fires, including capping the first US land well, extinguishing an underwater wild well, and a fire on a large vessel at sea. He got big press coverage for the Catco offshore fire (1959), the \"Devil's Cigarette Lighter\" in the Sahara desert (1962), a massive offshore blaze in the Bay Marchand field off the Louisiana coast (1970), the Bravo blowout in the North Sea (1977), the Ixtoc blowout in the Gulf of Mexico (1979), and the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea (1988), after an explosion had killed 167 oil workers. </p> <p>When Adair arrived in Kuwait in early March 1991, there were fires everywhere. Thick black smoke made it impossible to get any sense of direction. Adair and his teams were housed in ransacked buildings, but most serious was a lack of equipment - and water. </p> <p>He decided to exploit pipelines used to carry oil from stations in the oilfields to the Persian Gulf. These would be reversed to carry salt water from the Gulf back to fight the fires, a plan that required pumping the 1.5bn gallons of water that were eventually used. Adair had to fly to Washington in June to testify in order to get his equipment. With his flair for showmanship, he showed a dramatic slide presentation, explaining that extinguishing a fire is not the most difficult part. What happens afterwards is the most dangerous, because while the well is still blowing it can flash and reignite, killing the crew on top of it. </p> <p>Adair met President George Bush the following day to express his concerns, and got a pledge of support. By early July, the equipment began rolling into Kuwait, and by November the Emir of Kuwait ceremoniously extinguished the last fire. </p> <p>Adair retired when he sold his company in 1994. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Kemmie, daughter Robyn and son Jimmy. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Paul Neal (Red) Adair, firefighter, born June 18 1915; died August 7 2004</p>",
  "<p>The Olympics naturally attracts more than its fair share of scandal and controversy, but it does have one resource to help it overcome these problems - money. The revenues generated by the Athens Olympics - projected to exceed $3.3bn - will be more than any previous games, and will again highlight the massive potential earning power of the modern Olympics, and why there is now such demand from individual countries to host them. </p> <p>The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) income comes from two major sources - broadcast rights fees and sponsorship, with significant contributions also coming through ticketing and licensing agreements. </p> <p>Broadcast rights fees and sponsorship have contributed just over $2.5bn to the IOC in the run-up to this year's games and this is a direct result of the expected worldwide TV audiences. The Athens games will be seen in around 225 countries and will attract a global audience of over four billion. </p> <p>One of the reasons the Olympics outscores the (football) World Cup lies across the Atlantic. America's passion for sport is (in its own vernacular) awesome. But its sporting staples of American football, baseball, basketball and Nascar are all designed to feed the home market. The Olympics provide America with one of the nation's rare opportunities to compete on the world stage. This being the case, Americans love the games, and so too do their major television networks. Broadcasting rights fees are the largest single source of income for the IOC. The broadcasting rights revenues for Athens will top $1.5bn, just over half of which comes from America. </p> <p>Sponsorship is the other key contributor to the IOC's coffers. There are 11 key sponsors, whose agreements will all last for at least four years, which will include one summer and one winter games. The demand from sponsors to be a part of the Olympics is stronger than ever despite the fact that tobacco and alcohol sponsors are precluded from involvement. </p> <p>In Athens companies such as Coca-Cola, Kodak, McDonald's, Panasonic, Swatch, Visa and Xerox have each committed in excess of $50m to be one of the elite sponsors of the event and to have the right to use the prestigious rings in their advertising and promotional activity. </p> <p>Many of these companies have had long term relationships with the IOC. They know the value of the Olympics to them and they know how to make them work for their brands. This is crucial because, unlike other major sporting events such as the (football) World Cup, they don't benefit from athletes in the playing arenas being backed by perimeter advertising or interview backdrop boards. </p> <p>The sponsors, of course, all have different objectives and target markets. Fast-moving consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's, need to reach all genders and age groups, whereas companies such as John Hancock and Samsung will be eyeing a more targeted approach. Ticketing, hospitality and VIP passes to key areas and functions will be important benefits, which the sponsors will be looking to make optimum use of in a bid to impress their top customers as well as giving themselves an edge over their competitors. </p> <p>Not that the sponsors' competitors are likely to get much opportunity to ambush the event. The most stringent policing and monitoring of non-official marketing activity will be in place during the Olympics. Every effort is being made to ensure that nothing interferes with the official sponsors' ability to maximise their returns on their considerable investments. </p> <p>Of course it is not just the 11 key sponsors who are involved in the Games. There are different tiers of sponsors and suppliers including sponsorship packages for all of the National Olympic committees. In the UK, the British Olympic Committee has its own stable of sponsors who support the British team and provide funds and resources to help with training and other costs. Companies such as DIY giant B&amp;Q have linked up with the British Olympic team and are looking to develop their growing reputations as international brands, as well as engaging their employees and customers. </p> <p>For the sponsors involved in Athens, the perceived link with the spirit and ideals of the Olympics movement is a key element. The Olympics offers these sponsors the opportunity to associate themselves with some outstanding performances and extraordinary feats of human endeavour. No other world sporting event can do this. </p> <p>The 2008 games will take place in Beijing, and that will open up the massive and as yet relatively untapped Chinese market. From a financial point of view, Athens will be a huge success. And as the athletes begin their quest for gold, the IOC can relax - they've already struck it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Nigel Currie is vice president, Europe, of sports marketing company The GEM Group.

  "<p>A billionaire had already committed his fortune to making Chelsea pre-eminent, but Jose Mourinho found a way of raising the stakes yet higher. When he could have wallowed in his eye-popping achievements with Porto, he put his reputation on the line not just by coming to England but by developing an addiction to risky, provocative decisions.</p> <p>He is a remarkable character and the annual rejuvenation of the Premiership has been achieved this summer by an upgrade in the quality of its foreign managers. Mourinho, typically, pointed to the paucity of trophies in the career of his predecessor Claudio Ranieri.</p> <p>At Liverpool, the departed G\u00cbrard Houllier suffers in the comparison with Rafael Ben\u00cbtez, who won LaLiga with Valencia in two of the past three seasons and found room in his schedule to collect the 2004 Uefa Cup. Just as creditably, he previously took Extremadura and Tenerife to promotion. Spurs, for their part, have Jacques Santini, who set up Lyon's present domination of the French scene.</p> <p>Of the trio, it is Mourinho who mesmerises. Whether they triumph or flounder, Chelsea have already ensured that they will be the story of the season. People are agog to see what happens when so much wealth is aligned with so bullheaded a coach. The size of the bills presented to Roman Abramovich has not varied, but everything else is transformed.</p> <p>Where Ranieri bought a few grandees of the European scene such as Hernan Crespo and Juan Sebastian Ver\u00cbn, none of the seven newcomers to Stamford Bridge this summer, who were mostly picked by Mourinho, is older than 26. All of them have something to prove, and not only because of their age. </p> <p>Ricardo Carvalho did not make the line-up for the opening match of Euro 2004, Paulo Ferreira was dropped after it and Tiago never got on to the field at all in the tournament. Who, a couple of months ago, would have valued that trio at a total of more than \u00a340m? Mourinho's disdain for the notion that Portuguese players might toil in the Premiership could not have been expressed with greater emphasis or expense.</p> <p>It is part of his temperament to egg himself on by striding into positions of potential vulnerability. There will be no comfort zone for his team either and he will not be inclined to lower expectations as Ranieri occasionally did. Someone commented that the self-revering Mourinho would be \"the most hated man in England\" by the autumn, but there is as good a chance that the country will see the potential fun and enjoy him as they once did Brian Clough.</p> <p>The Premiership is the better for the arrival of the Portuguese since the accent on continuity among the other obvious contenders for the title is not at all stirring. Having reclaimed the title without a single defeat, Arsenal deserve to be favourites, but most of their exertions go into the struggle to retain their squad rather than add to it.</p> <p>Although the club does an excellent job preserving its players in good physical condition, they may be hampered if individuals like Thierry Henry are as badly affected by the exertions at Euro 2004 as Sol Campbell. Ars\u00cbne Wenger at least knows his preferred line-up, but the development of a new Manchester United is still a work in progress.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to stock up on forwards, with Louis Saha and now Alan Smith both added in 2004, suggests a return to first principles at a gung-ho club. None the less, the all-round vigour will depend on how Rio Ferdinand performs once his eight-month suspension comes to an end in September.</p> <p>The leading three clubs will not, at any rate, expect to find interlopers in their midst. Having kept Steven Gerrard, Ben\u00cbtez might think of smashing the cartel and he has already shown at Valencia that he does not depend on a celebrity-strewn side. It is difficult, though, to envisage uprisings elsewhere in the Premiership.</p> <p>Most clubs lack the cash to cure all their problems. Even after the headline signings of Patrick Kluivert, Nicky Butt and others, for example, concerns linger about the Newcastle United defence, particularly if Jonathan Woodgate's fitness is once more erratic.</p> <p>Sir Bobby Robson's side seem to have improved, but may not be sure how much higher they can go in the table. Middlesbrough, now possessing the Premiership's moodiest striking partnership in Mark Viduka and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, start from a more modest position and have the greater scope for progress. Steve McClaren has means that other managers envy. Many clubs are paying belated attention to their accounts and funds have dried up to the extent that Butt's value has dropped by \u00a33m since Birmingham City failed to tempt him in January. Several boards, including Manchester City's, can barely contemplate transfer fees at all.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, those with even moderate resources ought to prosper to a disproportionate degree. Santini, who had spells, at different times, as technical director and coach at Lyon, should be able to settle into the structure at Spurs and direct a squad that has been more impressive than its results towards the top third of the table.</p> <p>The theory that a little investment can go a long way outside the Premiership's elite will also be tested at the Hawthorns. Relegated once, West Brom are trying to avoid the previous error and conduct themselves more like Birmingham this time. Jonathan Greening and the Denmark defender Martin Albrechtsen have both arrived, with Kanu's temperament also to be scrutinised in a workaday part of the football scene.</p> <p>It is tougher for Norwich City and Crystal Palace to get the right standard of recruit and the Premiership pecking order will not easily be disrupted by them.
