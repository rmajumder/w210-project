  "<p>The Barbican and Somerset House are the two coolest multi-arts centres in the UK, according to a survey published yesterday by the Brand Council. But which one is cooler? </p> <p>Donne Robertson, director of events at Somerset House, talks of the sub-zero coolness of her London venue: \"We've got the ice rink from November 25, the beautiful courtyard. And we've been attracting younger audiences, with this year's gigs by PJ Harvey, Snow Patrol and Lemon Jelly.\" </p> <p>Across town at the Barbican Centre, artistic director Graham Sheffield responds: \"When I arrived nine years ago, the Barbican's foyers looked like the departure lounge of a Czech airport. But we're a lot cooler now - our younger visitors have been coming in huge numbers to events like Theatre de Complicite's The Elephant Vanishes.\" </p> <p>So is the Barbican Centre cooler than Somerset House? \"I'm not going to be drawn on that,\" says Sheffield. \"It's not a battle.\"</p>",
  "Gurkhas are to be allowed to apply to settle in the UK and gain British citizenship after leaving the army, Tony Blair announced today. <p>The prime minister's move comes at the end of a long campaign to win the Nepalese soldiers the right to live in the UK and an 18-month review by defence chiefs and officials from the Home Office and the Foreign Office. </p> <p>However, Gurkhas said they could not wholeheartedly welcome the news because the new provision will apply only to those who were discharged from the forces after July 1 1997. This means around 100 of the estimated 400 Gurkhas currently resident in the UK will not be eligible. </p> <p>\"This is extremely good news in a way but it is not a 100% celebration because of the cut-off date,\" said Major Tikendradal Dewan, the chairman of the British Gurkhas Welfare Society. </p> <p>\"It's difficult to rejoice at the news when we know that something like a quarter of the guys will not benefit from it. What will happen to them? Will they be deported?\" </p> <p>The Home Office said changes would be introduced to the immigration rules within the next few weeks, introducing a new procedure for former Gurkhas to smooth their way into the UK. </p> <p>Gurkhas who have served more than four years will be able to apply for entry clearance from Nepal or the UK after discharge. Although approval will not be automatic, most are expected to be granted indefinite leave to remain in Britain and then to apply for citizenship after 12 months. </p> <p>Many ex-Gurkhas who have already applied for citizenship have seen their cases left in limbo over the past two years while they waited for the review to be completed. </p> <p>Major Dewan said their uncertain immigration status meant that they were often unable to find suitable jobs or return to Nepal to visit relatives. </p> <p>\"The Gurkhas have served this country with great skill, courage and dignity during some of the most testing times in our history. They have made an enormous contribution not just to our armed forces but to the life of this country, and it is important their commitment and sacrifice is recognised,\" Mr Blair said when he announced the changes. </p> <p>\"Their 13 Victoria Crosses and numerous other bravery awards speak for themselves ... We have put together the best possible package to enable discharged Gurkhas to apply for settlement and citizenship. I hope that the decision I have made today will make our gratitude clear,\" said the home secretary, David Blunkett. </p> <p>Most Gurkhas retire in their mid-30s after 15 years service, said Major Dewan. Because of the shortage of work in their impoverished homeland and their inability to settle in the UK, many seek a second career overseas, often finding security work in troublespots like Iraq. </p> <p>\"We warmly welcome the government's decision. This should receive overwhelming support from the British people who have enjoyed the Gurkhas' valuable service over nearly 200 years,\" said shadow defence spokesman Keith Simpson. </p> <p>\"Citizenship should not be something that former Gurkhas should have to apply for. It should be given as a right,\" said Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Paul Keetch.</p>",
  "Despite the deaths of at least 21 Palestinians and three Israelis in one of Gaza's bloodiest days in months, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, will meet senior ministers later today to consider expanding his army's offensive in the territory. <p>The Israeli push was sparked by a rocket attack yesterday that killed two Israeli children in a border town, Reuters reported. Mr Sharon has ordered troops to use all means necessary to stop such attacks, which have persisted despite repeated Israeli raids and air strikes.</p> <p>Today, gunmen shot dead two Israeli soldiers and a woman jogger, while Israeli forces raiding the Jabalya refugee camp - Gaza's largest - killed at least 21 Palestinians and wounded more than 100 more, the highest Palestinian casualty count for a single day in four months.</p> <p>In the single deadliest incident, an Israeli tank fired a shell toward a group of Palestinians, killing at least seven people and wounding 20, many of them critically with loss of limbs, according to hospital doctors. The army said soldiers fired the shell at five gunmen planting explosives near the Jebalya market. </p> <p>Bulldozers also demolished 15 homes along a relatively narrow road leading into the camp, witnesses said, apparently to widen it and allow more tanks to get through. </p> <p>In addition to the Hamas rocket attack yesterday, Israeli troops pushing into Jabalya for the first time in four years of fighting killed two Palestinian schoolboys, apparently as they threw stones at the tanks. Another boy was shot dead by soldiers near a Jewish settlement.</p> <p>The latest spiral of violence has sent Mr Sharon scrambling to counter rightwing critics who say his plan to withdraw troops and settlers from occupied Gaza next year has emboldened militants trying to give the impression that Israel is being driven out.</p> <p>Hamas said it made the latest rocket attack on Sderot to mark the fourth anniversary of the intifada, which has cost more than 3,000 Palestinian and nearly 1,000 Israeli lives.</p>",
  "<p>An evangelical preacher who claims to help infertile couples in his congregation have \"miracle babies\" but is alleged to be at the centre of a child-trafficking racket could try to claim political asylum in Britain. </p> <p>Gilbert Deya, the self-styled archbishop of Gilbert Deya Ministries, is wanted by authorities in Kenya over allegations that he trafficked children from the slums of Nairobi for childless couples in Britain. </p> <p>At a press conference in Glasgow yesterday, Mr Deya presented his latest \"miracle mother\" and vowed to fight attempts by the Kenyan attorney general to force him to face trial in Nairobi. </p> <p>Mr Deya's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, refused to comment on whether his client would seek asylum in Britain as part of his attempt to fight extradition, but the pastor confirmed he would \"if advised to by my lawyer\". </p> <p>Last week the Charity Commission froze the bank accounts of Mr Deya's ministry - which has churches in Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester - pending an investigation into his activities. </p> <p>Mr Deya's wife, Eddah, was arrested this month in Nairobi and charged with stealing a child from the Pumwani hospital. When Kenyan police raided Mr Deya's house in Nairobi, they found 10 children, none of whom had any genetic connection to the Deya family. Twenty of Mr Deya's \"miracle babies\" have been taken into care in Kenya after DNA tests showed they had no genetic connection to their mothers. </p> <p>Mr Deya claims that \"through the power of prayer and the Lord Jesus\" he has helped many previously infertile women give birth. He says he has helped two women in the UK, one of whom has allegedly had three children in less than a year. He confirmed the women travelled to Kenya to \"give birth\". </p> <p>DNA tests show no genetic link between the alleged mother or father and the children. One child is in care in the south of England after an investigation by social workers. </p> <p>But Mr Deya denies allega tions of trafficking. \"I have been judged by the media as a child trafficker, which is a slave trade, but miracles have happened,\" he said. \"God has used me and, I tell you, God cannot use a criminal. They are miracles.\" </p> <p>The exact nature of these alleged miracles varies from mother to mother. But there appear to be common factors. The pregnancies do not show up on recognised tests - blood or urine - and the foetus cannot be seen by ultrasound. </p> <p>With Mr Deya yesterday was Deon Dakkins-Scott, who claims to be nine months pregnant despite having had her fallopian tubes removed. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Immigration Service said he could not comment on individual cases.</p>",
  "<p>More murmurs than rumours today, so we'll flip straight to the news pages, past the Angelina Jolie look-alike who's carrying Michael Jackson's twins, and screech to a halt on the revelation that Villa's <strong>resident pixie Lee Hendrie</strong> and <strong>aspiring reader Jade Goody</strong> have hooked up.</p> <p>Although Hendrie, clearly a die-hard romantic, went on a charm offensive when answering the allegation: \"It's f&amp;$\u00a3*n b*!&amp;@$*s mate. <strong>I can't get my breath.</strong> I do know her through a friend but I'm not [engaging with her romantically, or some such].\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Saints' trigger-happy chairman Rupert Lowe continues to support the qualification-shy Steve Wigley, despite an edict that he has to stand aside by December 14. \"Steve is <strong>doing a good job</strong>,\" chuckled Lowe, hand hovering over his holster. \"We will bring in someone alongside him.\" </p> <p>Other managers with a red laser dot settling between their eyes include Gary Megson, who will reportedly <strong>receive the bullet</strong> if the Albion can't grab hold of the form-guide and not so much turn it upside down as send it spinning on its apex, and defeat Bolton at home.

'Arry Redknapp wants a defender and he has his eye on Ghanaian national football coach to be, <strong>Marcel Desailly</strong>.

  "<p><strong> Ikea customer pays twice for the same kitchen</strong><br> Ikea prides itself on two particular achievements: cheapness and green awareness. These are splendid virtues, but the Nordic giant has a strange way of exhibiting them, as Julie Binding discovered when she was required to pay twice for the same kitchen and told that her day's purchases could not be delivered in one journey, but would require two lorry trips (and two hefty fees, of course) to reach her home. </p> <p>Before setting off on the long odyssey from Plymouth to the nearest store in Bristol, Binding had twice checked that the flat-packed kitchen, two bookcases and table and chairs she planned to purchase could be delivered for \u00a3100. So, on arrival at the blue-and-yellow monolith, she ordered and paid for her kitchen, then trundled about the aisles selecting the other bits of furniture she required. </p> <p>However, when she returned to the kitchen department and asked them to add the extras to the delivery, she was told that this was bureaucratically impossible and that the only solution was to reorder the kitchen then go to the dispatch counter to arrange delivery (presumably this makes sense to Ikea, if not to anyone else). She could, she was assured, cancel the first kitchen within 48 hours and receive a full refund. </p> <p>Bemused, she obeyed, and was given a cancellation number. Miraculously, the delivery lorry found its way to her house as promised. But then another one turned up bearing a second kitchen, and Binding found that her credit card had not been refunded, nor had the first order been cancelled. The next week was spent ringing Ikea and being promised return calls that never came. One helpful operative explained that Ikea had not telephoned because a letter was on its way, but that has never arrived. Binding is now in debt to the tune of \u00a31,800 and has given up hope of getting any response from Ikea. </p> <p> <strong> I can sympathise. It has been two months since I first contacted the press office about Binding's case and I have found it impossible to get a response from anyone. Green and cheap Ikea may (sometimes) be, but it could never boast of its customer services. At the last minute, however, there is a development. Ikea discovers that its behaviour has not been as good as it could have been and has now refunded Binding and added \u00a350 as a goodwill gesture. It is, it says unusually, willing to pay additional compensation and is now in discussion with its victim about the amount.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Customer services are too busy to answer calls</strong><br> On the subject of bashful corporations, David Hughes would like to know if anyone has ever managed to make contact with Panasonic. He is eager to report a fault with his hi-fi equipment before the year's warranty expires this month and, in the past couple of weeks, his horizons have shrunk to the edge of his telephone table as he has tried endlessly to get through to customer services. </p> <p>The main number puts him on indefinite hold and so he has tried customer support, but it is always engaged. Head office will only give out two further numbers, neither of which work, and his attempts to email have gone unacknowledged. </p> <p>\"I've been calling customer services every half hour, but a recording says they are too busy to answer and I am eventually cut off without having the chance to leave a message,\" he says. \"I'm concerned that the warranty will expire before I can get hold of anyone.\" </p> <p> <strong> Smugly confident, I set about using some media muscle, but the numbers are indeed busy or engaged. I eventually get through to a switchboard, but the operator has no idea what the number for head office is and puts me through to a bewildered bod in the finance department who can't recall ever hearing of a press office. Finally someone suggests I might call Japan the following dawn, but happily, before I can set my alarm, another someone recalls a friendly lady in media relations and I finally achieve breakthrough. </strong> </p> <p><strong>The press people decline to comment on how ordinary people are supposed to get through to the company, but they do wave a wand to cause a customer services manager to call Hughes and resolve his problem. Sadly, though, there must be hundreds like him camped by their telephones. Perhaps I should auction off the press number for charity.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Airline loses wheelchair but has not replaced it</strong><br> Somewhere between Nottingham and Bordeaux there lurks a wheelchair, and up in South Glamorgan an unfortunate reader sits housebound for want of it. </p> <p>Airlines are well practised in mislaying suitcases, but it takes real expertise to lose a large wheelchair which is what BMIbaby managed to do when Brian and Margaret Gibbon checked in for a flight from Nottingham. </p> <p>To their surprise, Brian was not allowed to wheel himself to the boarding gate as usual, but was ordered to leave his chair at the oversized baggage desk and borrow an airport model to reach the plane. </p> <p>The couple reached Bordeaux without incident, but the chair did not, nor, according to the Gibbons did BMI staff seem disposed to do anything about it. Eventually they hired a replacement from a pharmacy in order to get out of the airport. </p> <p>Since their return home, there has been no sign of the missing chair and it has not occurred to BMIbaby to loan out another one. \"They don't seem to appreciate that a wheelchair is a mobility-aid and not just another item of luggage,\" says the Gibbons' son Nicholas. </p> <p><strong> Low-cost airlines pride themselves on being \"no frills\" and, it seems, the safe arrival of luggage must count as a frill, for BMIbaby remains intransigent on the matter. It has, it admits, lost the chair, but insists that it can do nothing until the Gibbons have filled out a claims form and attempted redress through their own insurance company.</strong> </p> <p><strong>It would be interesting to know the Air Transport Users Council's opinion on this singular stinginess, but no one is available for comment. Perhaps other disabled travellers should invest in a spare wheelchair before travelling BMI.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Transatlantic travellers who are fans of TV crime shows can look forward to their own encounter with US law enforcement under new regulations requiring mandatory fingerprinting for foreigners arriving at US airports. <p>From today Britons, along with travellers from western Europe and other countries who for years have enjoyed a relatively uneventful arrival in America, will be subjected to a security regime devised in the aftermath of the September 11 2001 terror attacks. </p> <p>On arriving at US airports, Britons, who previously travelled visa-free under a waiver programme, will be photographed at immigration counters and have digital fingerprints taken by sliding their left index finger and then their right into a white plastic scanning device. Britons working in America have been subject to the regulations since January. </p> <p>US authorities insist the process is fast - 15 seconds for each traveller - and painless. \"We have been taking finger scans of British nationals coming under the visa regime since January, and we have not had any negative pushback from that,\"said Bob Mocny, the deputy director of the new visitors' regime. </p> <p>\"There is no ink involved, it's not like a booking process. It's a very simple device - kind of like ET going home, where the finger glows red.\" </p> <p>But it is going to be difficult for travellers to dispel worries about flying to America in a year that has produced a slew of airline horror stories - all the unfortunate results of US efforts to prevent a repeat of the 9/11 attacks. </p> <p>First, there were the repeated delays and cancellations of British and French flights to America during the Christmas holidays, after US officials suspected a terrorist was on board. </p> <p>The long-suffering passengers of BA flight 223 to Washington Dulles eventually landed on New Year's Eve, escorted by F-16 fighters. As for the Air France flight from Los Angeles to Paris, it turned out that the three suspect passengers were a child, an insurance agent from Wales and an elderly Chinese woman. </p> <p>Next, the writer Ian McEwan was turned away at the US-Canadian border a day before he was to deliver a lecture in Seattle. The authorities later said the refusal was an error. </p> <p>But there were no apologies for Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, whose flight last week was unaccountably diverted to Bangor, Maine, where he was bundled away by government agents and deported. </p> <p>Aside from Britons, the new measures apply to passengers from western Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei and Singapore. Only diplomats, children below the age of 14, and adults over 80 will be exempt, along with Canadians and some Mexicans.</p> <p>From October 26 Britons will also need a machine-readable passport; travellers using older passports, or those issued abroad, will be barred from the visa waiver programme and will be obliged to apply for US visas. </p> <p>And a year from now Britons may be required to swap that passport for a new one with an electronic chip containing biometric data such as fingerprints. </p> <p>So far, the authorities have not intercepted a single known terrorist. But the system has scored hits against other \"undesirables\", mainly ordinary criminals. </p> <p>\"It's keeping people out that the British tourist doesn't want to encounter,\" Mr Mocny said. He added: \"The US has always been a welcoming nation.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Everyone travelling to the US must have a visa or visa waiver (the green form given out on the plane). To stay more than 90 days you must have a visa </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Nationals of countries designated under the visa waiver programme may enter without a visa for up to 90 days </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Exceptions include people who have been arrested, even if the arrest did not result in a conviction, those with criminal records, those with certain serious communicable illnesses, those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from, the US, or have previously overstayed on the visa waiver. Such travellers must apply for special restricted visas </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> From today travellers from the 27 countries in the VWP will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed to verify their identity as they pass through immigration checkpoints </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Visitors arriving at an air or sea port will have both index fingers scanned before their picture is taken </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Customs and border protection officers will examine travel documents and ask questions about the visitor's stay in the United States </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The additional entry procedures will take an average of 15 seconds in most cases </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> All visa requirements can be found at <a href=\"http://www.usembassy.org.uk\">www.usembassy.org.uk </a></p>",
  "<b> City of rubble</b> <br> <p> It is only an hour's drive east from Ingushetia, where the fallout of one of the longest, most brutal wars of the last century has only begun to manifest itself, to the epicentre of the conflict itself, the Chechen capital, Grozny. </p> <p>So far, six of the Beslan militants have been identified as Chechen. Grozny's ruins, the gnawed skeleton of a city still breathless and flattened after being carpet-bombed twice in four years, embody the savage history of the Chechen people. My driver, Hussein, tells me, as we pass a graveyard on the 1st of May Street, of how its gravestones were ripped up during the mass deportation and executions ordered by Stalin in 1944. \"They were used as paving stones for the street in front of it,\" he says. \"But in 1991 [when Chechnya began to find its independence after the break-up of the Soviet Union], the president had them replaced and the cemetery turned into a memorial for the 1944 genocide.\" </p> <p>It is a fitting metaphor for the city, whose ruins still lie where they fell and whose people live among the rubble where their relatives died. Moscow's disregard for the city it has flattened twice reached almost comic heights earlier this year when President Putin said, after flying over the city in a helicopter, that it \"looked terrible\". Its residents, who live amid windowless shells of buildings with erratic electricity and gas and no water, are now oblivious to such Russian sympathy. </p> <p>The city's graffiti reflects the political turmoil of the past five years. In 1999, Russian troops marched back in to restore federal control after three years of independence had led the republic to collapse into a series of feuds between local warlords. One block of flats - gutted to the point where its sooty windows and the holes left by shells are indistinguishable - bears the slogan: \"Our president - Aslan Maskhadov\", the republic's separatist president, elected in 1996. Moscow has now put a $10m price on his head and said that he ordered the Beslan siege. </p> <p>Another wall proclaims their man as \"Akhmad Kadyrov\", the pro-Moscow president installed by the Kremlin in October, yet assassinated in May by separatists. Another refers to a candidate in last month's elections, staged again by Moscow to install their successor to Kadyrov. Yet the most telling speaks of the republic's thirst for autonomy - after peace. Sprayed in red paint on the underpass on a main avenue, it reads: \"Our President - Our choice.\" </p> <p>The city is livelier these days than it has been in years. Violence is never far away, Russian troops patrolling the streets at daybreak, walking in columns along the sides of the road, nervously close to their APCs and tanks. But the incessant gunfire that rattled through the night six months ago has died down. Now people sell music cassettes on the central street and Tajik children - who consider the poverty of Central Asia worse than that of Chechnya - beg on street corners. </p> <p>In the days after Beslan, Russians interviewed by their own media often blamed the massacre on the Chechen people, an ethnic group widely distrusted, mostly due to ignorance and fear. Yet most people on Grozny's main streets last week expressed their disgust at Beslan. </p> <p>Ruslan, 21, said: \"It's not right. They are kids and not to blame. If we have an argument, what does your son or my son have to do with it? It was some sort of hell there.\" </p> <p>Malika, 53, walking alongside her daughter with her granddaughter in a pushchair, said: \"It's hard to say what it was about. You know, before [the wars] nobody bothered us here and we lived in peace. Beslan is not connected [with separatism], and was probably international terrorism. But the only people who really know what happened are the very stupid, and the very clever.\" </p> <p>Grozny knows about loss. I remember the small wall of posters of the missing from Beslan - a glass window near the school where anxious parents put up pictures of their children. Such pictures, torn from the family photo album to serve an immediate practical purpose, are a common sight in Chechnya, where human rights groups, politicians or officials readily show you a thick folder of the missing - young men who have been abducted and vanished in the republic. </p> <p>In the busy market, middle-aged traders Fatima and Zura appear torn between their disgust at Beslan and their hatred of Moscow. \"The [Beslan militants] were not boeviki - the boeviki fight the Russians, not children. Muslims do not kill children. Putin and the FSB organised it all to help them extinguish the people of the north Caucasus. During the siege, the Russian special forces shot at the children. We are not the sort of people to do that. We build and build again whatever happens to us,\" she says, pointing to the wrecked buildings around her. </p> <p>She says that after the last war, Moscow deliberately let top Chechen separatist leaders go because they wanted a continued \"reason to extinguish us as a people. The federals took away two of my sons, Rizvan, 30, and Ziyaoudi, 24, in October 2000 [at one of the main checkpoints on the Ingushetian border]. I know nothing of them. Even two weeks ago, they shot three men dead at the same place, a controlled shot to the forehead finishing them off.\" </p> <p>Zura breaks down, too. \"My neighbour was taken away only yesterday. On every second floor in every block of flats there is a mother who is crying for their missing. Putin says that everyone who supports terrorists should be wiped out. But he has been trying to do that to us for years. We work all day for a piece of bread, and at night end up crying again.\" </p> <p>Across Grozny Moscow's control is enforced by large groups of Chechen police and militia, many of whom have chosen to be on the Kremlin's payroll rather than fight for inde pendence in the country's thick woodland. Some separatists are exhausted by war or disillusioned by the Islamist extremism in the movement, and Moscow has capitalised on this to bolster recruitment. </p> <p>This tactic came to a head when pro-Moscow President Kadyrov was installed in October, allowing the Kremlin to keep control but use loyal Chechens to do their fighting. Chechen turned on Chechen, and separatists began to turn on each other, or turn to Islamist extremists for ideological or financial fuel. </p> <p>In a dark cafe, a senior police officer in charge of fighting organised crime offers me a thick cup of instant coffee. He tells me: \"In essence the dynamic of the conflict has not changed here since [the start of the last war in] 1999. There are as many recruits [to the separatist cause] as then. Now you can call yourself a Jihadist, a Wahhabite, a separatist, a pro-federalist - whatever you want. There are no clear sides any more.\" </p> <p>Asked why he thinks Beslan happened, he says: \"I am a military man and cannot say,\" before he launches into a long comparison of how the American military-industrial complex propitiously persuaded Washington it needed to fight the Vietnam war, and that the Beslan massacre was intended to spark a regional multi-ethnic conflict. </p> <p>He echoes the blank distrust of Moscow felt here. People's loathing of power is so complete that they need little evidence before hatching the wildest of conspiracy theories against their federal government. He brims with tales of infighting among the presidential security services and of rising crime and unemployment, local police and security men bolstering their income through kidnapping and crime. </p> <p><b> The road to Engenoi</b><br> </p> <p> Grozny is a melting pot where the varying beliefs and allegiances in Chechnya clash. But four of the estimated six Chechens among the Beslan militants came not from its busy streets, but from the south-eastern hills, a two-hour drive away. En route to Engenoi, we pass through the town of Shali. We pause for half an hour, and I fall asleep in the hot car. A Chechen policeman wakes me to ask me to move the car. We talk. \"Here it's calm\", he says. \"But two to three kilometres down the road,\" he points, \"it's completely out of control.\" </p> <p>He speaks of how two weeks ago a group of boeviki attacked three schools where the local police and some of the Kadyrovtsi - the personal security service of the late president Kadyrov - were stationed. Four died in the attack, and the policeman's eyes remain wide at the alien enemy he says he faced. \"There were Arabs and nigres [Russian for African blacks] among the boeviki . They had weapons like those the Americans carry in Iraq. It was like nothing I have ever seen before.\" </p> <p>We drive through endless villages in the Chechen hills - settlements that seem so bucolic and remote that they should be immune to war. Ishkoi Yurt, Balansu - towns separated by checkpoints manned by tense Russian troops, wearing vests, shades and listening to Colombian pop star Shakira on the radio. </p> <p>The village of Engenoi, near the border with Dagestan, is at one of the highest points of the Chechen hills. The rickety road to it runs past lines of edgy Russian troops, each with their dugout, or APC, a slight refuge for when the boeviki come. One reads a book on top of a tank; another chops wood, he and his colleagues all in grimy vests and civilian tracksuits. Further up the road, a nervous line of conscripts, no older than 23, form, their officer barking them into order as they pile off the back of a troop carrier. </p> <p>This is the heart of rebel country, a region only nominally under federal control. \"The boeviki come here to escape from the Russians,\" says a local. \"Among these trees and hills, they can never find them, and the boeviki can rest.\" </p> <p>The sun is bright and fierce on the winding road, and a few hundred metres away from Engenoi stand two Russian troops. One bears the patch - worn by most soldiers in Chechnya - of the Russian interior ministry. The other bears no markings at all - an \"FSB-nik\", or member of the security services. He patiently writes down the details of those who pass him. </p> <p>The reason for the checkpoint becomes clear inside Engenoi. A group of Russian troops are slowly and calmly going from door to door. A zachistka - a Russian word that literally translates as \"mop-up\" - is under way. Zachistkas became infamous in the two years immediately after the second war as the favoured method of federal troops to repress the separatist population. Young men - or any of fighting age or considered suspicious - were rounded up from their homes, detained, sometimes tortured, often executed. Memorial, which documents abuses on only a third of the territory of Chechnya, estimates that since the second war ended in 2000, nearly 3,000 people have been abducted. From January 2002 to August this year, it can list 1,254 people who have been abducted, 148 of whom are known to be dead, and 757 of whom are still missing. </p> <p>The zachistkas go on, much of the work now done by loyal Chechens. But here in Engenoi, Russian troops are still at work, their faces not masked and their approach a lot calmer than nightmarish accounts of the zachistkas of years ago. They plod from house to house, politely opening doors. A large armoured van travels along the road with them, perhaps intended for anyone suspicious they find as they search houses for men, weapons or a sign of dissent. </p> <p>The Kulayev family live a few houses up the road from the troops and are not bothered. Obughash, 69, first learned that his two sons, Hanpashi and Nurpashi, were among the most loathed men in Russia when he saw a tape of Nurpashi in police captivity on television. Nurpashi was one of the only militants taken alive, his brother one of the 32 killed in the storm. </p> <p>Obughash, who mumbles his words into his grey beard as he stares at the floor, says the zachistkas have been going on in Engenoi for six months. Little is known in town about Mairbek Shibikhanov, one of the Beslan militants and another Engenoi resident, whose wife was reportedly also one of the suicide bombers in the school. </p> <p>Obughash speaks only of his elder son, Hanpashi, leaving references to the younger Nurpashi as footnotes to a greater loss. He speaks of how Hanpashi attended the redbrick school down the road - a similar building to that which now lies gutted in Beslan - and particularly enjoyed history. </p> <p>\"He prayed a lot and loved the history of Islam.\" I ask what historical periods he liked. \"There is no end or start to the history of the Koran\", he replies. </p> <p>He continues: \"He was not a Wahhabite, but a pure Muslim.\" </p> <p>Hanpashi served in the Russian army once he left school in 1991. He then fought in the first Chechen war for the separatists, his father says. He is vague about Hanpashi's involvement in the second war, saying it was all over so fast. </p> <p>In mid-August 2001, Hanpashi was shot in the arm during a roadside dispute. He was subsequently arrested, and tortured, his family say. His interrogators put sand in his wound and sat on him so he could not breathe, they claim. He was later transferred to hospital, where his arm, which had turned gangrenous, was amputated. </p> <p>\"He was arrested for being part of an illegal armed group\", Obughash says, \"but amnestied [as part of a government programme to let separatists return to normal lives] on December 18 2001.\" </p> <p>Obughash said his sons then went to live in Ingushetia, where Hanpashi could get better treatment for his arm, which required constant medical attention. The last time he saw Hanpashi alive was on August 26. His son looked broken. \"I asked him why he did not come home, and he said he felt like half a person\", Obughash says. \"He was helpless without an arm. It was a kind of death penalty. He could not go back to fight [for the militants] and he could not return to a peaceful life. They did not say what their plans were.\" </p> <p>He leans towards me and adds: \"But now I will tell you something he said that I have kept from my wife. That last time we met, Hanpashi looked at me and said: 'I don't want them to take these hands alive.'\" </p> <p>Three days later, as 32 militants stormed into the Beslan school, his third son went to Hanpashi's Ingushetian home to find it empty. </p> <p>Hanpashi's disability and desperation does not, even for his father, appear reason enough for his actions. Obughash has identified them both from pictures shown him by prosecutors, and reluctantly accepts their infamy. He says: \"I did not expect this from them. They probably thought the Russians would never storm the building because they had kids in there with them.\" He appears to absolve Nurpashi of blame, saying: \"He was just his brother's bodyguard, looking after him.\" </p> <p>I ask him why he thinks Hanpashi did it and he replies with a wry half-smile:\"We have to learn from the experience of Lenin. He said, 'There is red and there is white' [in reference to the civil war between the revolutionary Bolsheviks and the White generals seeking to preserve tsarist rule]. There is red and there is white. They [the Beslan militants] did not ask for money, but for two words. It was all about two words. 'Free Chechnya'.\" </p> <p>As he speaks, the sisters of the two men sit quietly, and one of their young sons rushes about the room. After 20 minutes, Obughash runs out of things to say and stares at the floor. The zachistka is nearing and I return to my car. As we drive out of the village, the distant sound of machine gunfire echoes through the hills.</p>",
  "In Beslan, they are filling in the holes. The cemetery on the road from the airport is a sprawling mass of upturned earth, each fresh grave marked out from the surrounding mud by a perimeter of red bricks. The flowers and bare wooden stick crosses jut out from the rough grazing pasture. <p>A fortnight after the Beslan siege, the funerals are still going on, and 70 graves remain unfilled. The empty soil trenches are a reminder of how many families still face the gruesome process of identifying the scorched remains of their dead. </p> <p>Lubov Salamova, 58, weeps at the grave of her grandson, Sergei Alkaev. \"He would have been 15 this month. His mother died in a gas explosion at home years earlier, and now he has left me. He was found dead in the gym, his head and hands partly missing. He was such a good boy\". Across the 188 fresh graves, the sound of wailing hangs in the country air. </p> <p>They are also filling in the holes outside Middle School Number 1. Aslan and another workman drill away the surface of the road near the garages on the school's left. Here, a fortnight earlier, Russian special forces and hysterical locals had broken a hole in the garage walls, giving access to the school's courtyard, where the bloody siege was into its second hour. Through the hole poured grimy, bloody children and parents on to waiting stretchers and into local cars, requisitioned for want of ambulances. Aslan explains that his orders are to dig up the pock-marks and make the road smooth again, to remove the traces of the grenade blasts and bullets. </p> <p>No such cosmetic considerations are in evidence at the school itself. It remains an open monument to the town's grief and catalyst for its anger. For two weeks, locals have simply trudged over its ruins, mindless to the human remains and unspent ordnance buried under them. The remains of \"Boevik 3\" - the Russian prosecutor's ID for \"militant 3\" of the 32 who seized the school - still lie outside. His mortar shell, webbing, gloves, the dusty knot of his gristle, are turned over by a curious youth's trainer. </p> <p>The school's serene calm is punctuated by the indelible smell of fire and the mourning of local mothers. Revenge is part of the vocabulary of grieving here; amid the rubble, there has been talk of war. Zaur Rubayev, 16, stands hunched with four other teenagers, mulling over the loss of his brother, Hassan, 14, in the shade of the school walls. He tells me: \"Of course I want revenge, but against who?\" </p> <p>Anger has grown against the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia, from where some of the terrorists came, and against whom North Ossetia fought a bloody war in 1992. Many fear Beslan's grief could eventually spark conflict in a region as ethnically diverse and tense as the former Yugoslavia. But Rubayev says: \"What's the point of attacking them? We can't go and kill their children.\" </p> <p>Instead, around them are signs of how their grief has been internationalised, appropriated by the various\"wars on terror\" fought worldwide. The Israeli government has sent hundreds of bouquets that now line the walls along the gym. </p> <p>Beslan's scars are rarely far from the surface. Near the gym I meet Diana Gagiyeva and Borik Rubayev, both aged 7. They play together despite the terrible gulf that the siege has created between them. Diana escaped from the gym with her mother, and grins, \"I don't know,\" when asked about her return to school. Borik was dragged from the wreckage by a rescuer whose face he cannot remember. He is clearer on another fact. \"I don't have a father or mother\", he says. \"Well, I did, and he was called Arthur, and she was called Lena, but they both died there.\" He points towards his school. </p> <p>There also remain many gaps in the town's grasp of events. Why did the first bomb detonate, sparking the chaotic storming of the building? Few believe that the government is telling the truth about the number of dead. The local administration says 1,347 people were taken hostage, while the prosecutor insists that only 329 of the 1,156 hostages died. </p> <p>At the Palace of Youth, a rickety, unmaintained theatre hall, a private, local meeting is taking place at 1pm on Wednesday. Outside, bearded, husky men gather in circles. \"Of course the real number of dead is higher than 329 - just look at the number of graves there are\", says one. The unemployed, the grieving and angry, and even the prosecutor and local mayor, pile into the theatre. After a 10-second, respectful silence, some take it in turns to speak. Most talk in soothing truisms. Yet a war veteran from the 92 war against Ingushetia stands, a crutch in place of his missing leg, to interrupt one speech. \"We need revenge. We need to mobilise the youth\", he says. \"We need to get rid of our local president\". </p> <p>Above all, what the people of Beslan crave is answers to the countless questions that followed hard on the heels of the grief and shock. Who were these people who were prepared to turn a school into a charnel house? Why Beslan? Why our school? Why was the siege so catastrophically mismanaged?How on earth did it come to this? </p> <p>It will take months or even years to produce meaningful answers, if it is ever possible to answer adequately such questions. But to try to fill in a few of the unfilled holes in the story of Middle School Number 1, I head east from Beslan, along the sparse highways across Ingushetia, and into the hills of Chechnya where the seeds of Russia's September 11 were planted. To understand the road to Beslan, I follow the road out of it. </p> <p>In the days following the massacre, Beslan's anger focused on neighbouring Ingushetia but the first piece of this bloody puzzle lay uncomfortably close to home. Twenty minutes drive south through barren, green plains and dejected roadside houses is the town of Elkhotovo. It's a sleepy place, an armed policeman guarding a nursery school the only sign of its proximity to the horrors of a few weeks ago. </p> <p>In the leafy courtyard of one Soviet-era housing block is the groundfloor flat where Vladimir Khodov lived. My driver, Timur, knows of Khodov, and takes me straight there. Some time ago, Khodov's brother, Borik, had abducted one of Timur's relatives, Sveta Gabisova. Later, he was killed in revenge by another of Timur's relatives, Sveta's brother, Iriston Gabisov. Yet Vladimir went on to eclipse his brother's parochial notoriety. </p> <p>Khodov is the only North Ossetian who has been identified so far out of the 32 militants who seized the Beslan school. Now his old, starving cat, Dima - sipping a watery-yellow liquid from the cut off-end of a plastic bottle - is the only sign of life at his former flat. Here, his mother, Alexandria, and father, Anatoly lived, their two sons occasionally coming home from prison or elsewhere. </p> <p>When I arrive, neighbour Lyda Darakhokova, 50, is in her garage, busy forcing homegrown cucumbers into large pickling jars ahead of winter. She tells me that Anatoly was a good man, but recalls little about the mother. \"Vladimir was a character,\" she says. \"Both the brothers were underhand and cunning. Vladimir was not an Ossetian,\" she insists, \"he was Russian.\" </p> <p>She says he was converted to the Muslim faith when in jail and left the family home in 2003, coming back only for three days to bury his brother in June. My driver Timur recalls how his mother watched at Borik's funeral while Vladimir burst in. Outraged at the Orthodox Christian funeral, he carried away the corpse to give it a proper Muslim burial and then disappeared again. </p> <p>Vladimir became a wanted man when he set off a bomb in the market of the main city of Vladikavkaz in February, according to locals and media reports. He next appeared in Middle School Number 1. </p> <p>Lyda adds: \"The police took Alexandria away at 5pm on the night of the siege and we have not seen her since. We know nothing about her now.\" </p> <p>I peer through a gap in their flat curtains to see ageing flowers in a vase on the empty flat floor. \"It's hard to understand\", she adds. \"Children?\" </p> <p><b> Crossing the border</b><br> </p> <p>It is 30 minutes' drive east through rows of fallow cornfields and verdant sloping hills to the border with Ingushetia. The frontier is closed to cars - a weak bid to keep putative hordes of vengeful Ossetians out. Yet I manage to cross on foot, walk past the open door of a Russian military armoured personnel carrier (APC) parked at the border post's tranquil roundabout, and then the capital of Nazran is only 10 minutes away in a taxi. </p> <p>Two years ago, Ingushetia was a quiet haven to which Chechens fled to escape the ongoing violence of their shattered homeland. Tent-camp cities of refugees emerged on the border, their inhabitants quickly discovering that the horrors of Chechnya followed them. Moscow has for centuries lumped the Ingush and Chechen people together. Stalin sent them both to Kazakhstan in 1944, considering them an equal threat. Brezhnev eventually allowed them home. After the second Chechen war, Russian officials began to suspect that the Ingush president, Ruslan Aushev, was allowing separatists to shelter in Ingushetia, and installed a former KGB officer, Murat Zyazikov, as president. His hardline regime has attempted to send the refugees home, yet also allowed Russian troops to begin replicating in Ingushetia the brutal tactics of their Chechen campaign. </p> <p>The past year has seen the republic transformed from a quiet farming community into the new frontline in Russia's purported war on terror. It began with occasional disappearances and abductions. Then, four students who were quietly sitting and smoking by a river one March evening, were shot at by a Russian military helicopter. Two of them were killed. Days later, the military surrounded a house where they claimed militants were sheltering, and blew it to pieces with grenades. Tensions rose, and Ingushetia became a more dangerous place to be than neighbouring Chechnya, where a decade-old war still rages. On June 21 at 8pm, up to 200 militants burst into the republic's capital, Nazran, and began murdering local policemen. They easily gained control of the capital and some of its major buildings, setting up checkpoints, where they stopped cars, and shot dead local law-enforcement officials. Up to 100 people died in one night. By all accounts, the well-equipped Russian troops stationed there did little to confront the militants. </p> <p>Now Ingushetia has been reluctantly dragged into the spotlight again. At least three of the Beslan militants lived, or were born in, this tiny, volatile republic, which you can drive across in 20 minutes. I drive north from Nazran to thetown of Sagopshi. For much of this year, Sagopshi has been a peaceful place, though it has been bequeathed a modest infamy by its former resident, Bei-Ala Tsechoyev, 27. </p> <p>Tsechoyev lived on a broad, sparsely populated road here. Some men selling motor parts at the market point me immediately towards his home, and local hospitality soon has me standing in the courtyard of his uncle, Magomed, 70, who fumes at his people's fate. </p> <p>\"I served in the army and was sent to Kazakhstan for 13 years. I worked 24 hours a day for the Soviets. I fought in the 92 war where the Ossetians killed children and pregnant women. Nobody cared then. But now we have the KGB and the FSB all over us. And everybody suddenly cares - but about Beslan. I want to live like a man here and for a woman to be able to live like a woman. Without that, it is better not to live.\" </p> <p>His supposed neighbour goes next door to ask if Tsechoyev's family want to speak, and returns with an emphatic \"No\". A few minutes later, I approach their door myself and the supposed neighbour answers. \"OK, so really I am his brother,\" he admits. \"What do you want?\" </p> <p>At first, Hussein, 25, insists that he has seen his brother since the siege but after a while he softens. \"Look, you are English. Where do you live? England. The [Chechens] are fighting for their independence, too.\" We begin to talk about the supposed influence of foreigners - namely Saudi Arabian Wahhabite extremists - on the Chechen separatist cause. Moscow has long maintained that the independence movement sold out to well-funded Wahhabite groups once the separatist core began to flag in the late-90s. Yet Hussein insists: \"There are no Wahhabites, no Arabs here. We do not need Arabs.\" </p> <p>I ask for a photo of his brother and, now friendly and open, Hussein insists that there are none as Bei-Ala feared the police. \"He was part of an independence movement,\" he says. </p> <p>The media have reported that he fled town before Beslan because locals thought he was a Wahhabite and wanted him dead. As he fled, he reportedly shot a local police chief in the neck, wounding him and making his return impossible. </p> <p>Hussein will not fill in the gaps in his brother's story. No photo, no personal details, no fond memories. It is as if, for Hussein, his brother no longer exists. I ask Hussein where Bei-Ala may be now. He answers: \"Allah knows he is alive.\" I leave a phone number that Bei-Ala never calls, and head for Malgobek, a few kilometres down the road. </p> <p>The involvement of some Ingushetians in Beslan and other terrorist acts has fuelled Russian theories that Islamist extremism has spread across the Caucasus, involving them in a war on terror on their own soil. But across the region, most locals see the extremist violence as a radical extension of the Chechen separatist conflict, not some foreign, imported evil. </p> <p>A local prosecutor confirmed to me media reports that the other Ingush militant was called Isa Torshkhoyev, 26, and that he lived in Malgobek. It takes about an hour to drive up the long and dusty roads, often blocked with cows, to the small village, Stari - or Old - Malgobek. The town's idyllic setting does little to soften its poverty. Media reports have laid much of the blame for Torshkhoyev's extremist fate upon the collapsed economy here. A turner like his father, he could not find work. They reportedly ended up cutting down hay - a car's worth can be sold for \u00a330. Isa's cousin, Kazbek, dug up bricks at an old, disused tile factory, selling them for 6p each. When the money ran out, the Wahabites were reported to often be the only source of income. Some of the bus stops here have Arabic writing on them. </p> <p>Torshkhoyev's mother, Luba, 64, answers the door of her ramshackle cottage, wearing a green headscarf and a pair of cut-down Wellington boots, her toe poking through a hole in the left shoe. She points to the small shed behind her home, now a wreck of bricks, collapsing walls and rusted doors, where her son used to live. </p> <p>In March of last year, Isa welcomed in six friends, apparently fellow Chechen refugees aged 16 to 22. He reportedly asked them for 300 rubles each, but they paid double. At 7.20am on March 5, according to testimony collected by the human rights group, Memorial, local police and Russian troops blocked off the roads to the house and approached the shed. Isa and his friends opened fire. A two-hour gunfight ensued, during which five of Isa's guests were killed, while he and another escaped. One policeman died. </p> <p>The FSB apparently believed that the men were \"boeviki\" - a catch-all word that epitomises the gulf in perceptions in the conflict. It translates directly as \"fighter\", but means to some locals \"separatist fighter\", yet to Russian officials, \"terrorist militant\". </p> <p>Luba says that her son never came back and that her husband and second son went to live in the village. She has nothing to say about him except that he had no friends and was \"a good Muslim boy\". The prosecutor had come to take away his possessions and a blood sample from her to help identify her son, she says. Her husband had been asked to identify a corpse in Beslan and said that it was not their son's.</p>",
  "The Gaza Strip was bracing itself for an Israeli military assault last night after a Hamas rocket attack on an Israeli town killed two children, one an infant. <p>Ariel Sharon vowed to respond \"with severity\" to the attack on the town of Sderot, which wounded another 20 people, some of them children. Late last night, missiles ploughed into the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing two Palestinians, one a policeman. </p> <p>Hours earlier a large Israeli force sent to reoccupy the Gaza camp to prevent rocket attacks killed two Palestinian schoolboys. Another boy was shot dead by soldiers near a Jewish settlement. </p> <p>The police said the Hamas rocket hit a house, killing the two children - Dorit Aniso, two, and four-year-old Yuval Abebeh. </p> <p>Another rocket hit a Jewish settlement in Gaza, lightly wounding a Palestinian worker. Sderot residents gathered near the area, some chanting \"Death to Arabs.\" </p> <p>A resident, Ronen Edri, told the newspaper Ha'aretz that he had seen a boy with head wounds lying in the street and tried to give him first aid. \"There was a great deal of hysteria all around. People were screaming from shock. I tried to stem the bleeding for the boy, and then [ambulance] personnel arrived and took him away.\" </p> <p>Another neighbour, Haviv Ben Abbo, also tried to assist the children. \"I saw one child without his legs. We tried to help the other one but it was too late,\" he said. The attack was launched even though the army had sent dozens of tanks, bulldozers and armoured vehicles to seize control of Jabaliya refugee camp in an attempt to stop Palestinian insurgents firing their rudimentary rockets, known as Qassams, into Israel. </p> <p>The army said it met stiff resistance in the camp, a stronghold of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, from Palestinian insurgents throwing grenades, shooting, and planting explosives. </p> <p>But two of the three people killed were 14-year-old schoolboys, apparently shot as they threw stones at the tanks. </p> <p>The deaths in Sderot, particularly coming at the beginning of a Jewish religious holiday, put further pressure on Mr Sharon to confront Palestinian insurgents before he forces Jewish settlers to leave the Gaza Strip next year. </p> <p>The mayor of Sderot, Eli Muyal, has said that if European countries faced similar attacks, Palestinian towns \"would have been wiped out off the face of the earth\". </p> <p>The prime minister called Mr Muyal to assure him that the government would respond with severity to the attack, according to Israel radio. </p> <p>The army has made a dozen incursions into the northern Gaza Strip in the past three months, occupying Beit Hanoun for a month. But mortar assaults on Sderot and the settlements have only intensified. </p> <p>The Israeli army fired several shells and rockets into Jabaliya, and bulldozers destroyed buildings. Gunfire was heard for much of the day. Palestinian sources named the two boys killed in the camp as Saed Muhammad Abu al-Eish and Ahmad Abdul Fattah Madi and said they were throwing stones when they were killed. The army said soldiers shot Palestinians planting explosives or attempting to fire rockets. </p> <p>Doctors said that nearly 20 people were taken to hospital with gunshot wounds, at least seven of them children in school uniform. </p> <p>Hassan Khalil, 15, who was slightly wounded in his hand, said: \"They shot at us before we could even throw the stones. </p> <p>\"The resistance couldn't stop the tanks so we know the stones won't either. But we want the Jews to know that we will not just lie down.\" </p> <p>The army killed a Hamas fighter on the edge of the camp, and in central Gaza shot dead a 13-year-old, Mohammed Jabber, who it said had emerged from a stone-throwing crowd which had entered a forbidden zone next to the Netzarim Jewish settlement and run towards the fence. Several other children were wounded by its gunfire. </p> <p>In a similar incident near Kfar Darom settlement, the army wounded four students. In the West Bank, it killed two Palestinian gunmen in raids on Nablus and Jenin. A third died when his car crashed as he fled. </p> <p>Hamas said it made the latest rocket attack on Sderot to mark the fourth anniversary of the intifada, which has cost more than 3,000 Palestinian and nearly 1,000 Israeli lives.</p>",
  "When Labour party delegates debate Iraq today, they should propose a small revolution in British policy towards America. <p>Under Tony Blair, Britain has more than ever practised what I call the Jeeves school of diplomacy. Like the inimitable Jeeves, and like Alfred, the aged British butler to impetuous Batman, we are impeccably loyal in public but privately whisper sage advice, mixed with a little delicately worded criticism, into Washington's ear. \"Is that wise, sir?\" we murmur, always the perfect gentleman's gentleman. But the boss no longer acts on our advice. </p> <p>The origins of this increasingly humiliating approach go back to the second world war, when, after the fall of France, Churchill decided that the only hope for Britain lay in getting America engaged at our side in world affairs. The result was an effusive public solidarity of wartime allies, mixed with often sharp private disagreements. Now Tony Blair believes, as he indicated once again in his conference speech on Tuesday, that's also where we are today - in a new world war against terrorism. The 9/11 attacks were our generation's Pearl Harbor, 2001 was an action replay of 1941, and so we must again walk Churchill's way. </p> <p>But Churchill was Churchill. He led what was still a world power, although one on the cusp of a precipitous decline. He was listened to both for who he was and for the power he represented. Yet as the power relations between the two countries shifted, even Churchill found himself humiliated. \"What do you want me to do?\" he once angrily asked, when discussing a wartime loan arrangement with Roosevelt. \"Get on my hind legs and beg like Fala?\" Fala was Roosevelt's dog. </p> <p>It's been downhill since then. Harold Macmillan said we should be Greeks to America's Rome - forgetting that those Greeks were usually slaves. John F Kennedy listened to Macmillan sometimes, as Ronald Reagan did to Margaret Thatcher, although that did not stop Reagan invading the British Commonwealth island of Grenada without consulting her. By the time we reached the diplomacy of the Iraq crisis, the British government was reduced to being the provisional wing of the state department. It became almost an internal player in Washington's inter-agency struggles, seeking to influence the president a little this way or that, while swearing constant loyalty to Bush's \"war on terror\" line. </p> <p>Jeeves's tone of voice is perfectly caught by a recently leaked document in which the then British ambassador to Washington sums up his conversation with Paul Wolfowitz, the Bush administration's arch-hawk on Iraq. \"We backed regime change but the plan had to be clever and failure was not an option,\" Jeeves reports himself as murmuring, subtly adapting to the American idiom. </p> <p>This is not to say we had no potential influence. We did. American opinion polls showed that Bush needed a prominent ally to be sure of popular support for the war on Iraq. He needed Britain. But this potential leverage was negated by the Jeeves approach. It not only muffled the cautionary message, which senior British officials, including that ambassador, would deliver much more sharply in private conversations with fellow Brits. It also left Washington calculating, rightly, that Britain would always come along in the end. And so we descended into this God-awful mess, with a knife at Kenneth Bigley's throat and Iraq a worse recruiting ground for terrorists. </p> <p>Blair got two things for his support of Bush: the attempt to secure a second UN resolution, which failed, and the road map for a two-state peace settlement between Israel and Palestine, which Bush tore up in front of our prime minister's nose on the White House lawn a year later. That should have been the last straw for the Jeeves approach. </p> <p>Especially if, as now seems likely, we face another four years of Bush, British policy should change in two respects. First, we should no longer hold back from criticising Washington in public on matters of real importance, like Israel and Palestine. The \"we're at war so we mustn't give succour to the enemy\" objection really does not apply, because this is not a war like the second world war. Even if this president doesn't listen, Congress and American public opinion will. We owe this to our self-respect. American liberals can't understand why we don't do more of it already. In the run-up to the Iraq war, a student at a liberal arts college in Kansas said to me: \"I know that we used to be a colony of Britain, but what I want to know is: when did Britain become a colony of the United States?\" Not true, of course. But do we want to be seen that way? </p> <p>Second, and even more important, we should build up the European Union as a powerful partner for the United States. Give it some military muscle. Help it to speak with one voice on major foreign policy issues like Iran, as it already does on trade. Find ways of concentrating its large but still diffuse soft power. This will place some short-term strains on our treasured bilateral ties with Washington but, in the long run, it will give us more influence there. The British tail will never wag the American dog. Europe, however, is much more than a tail. If Europe can consolidate and project its inchoate, multi-dimensional power, Washington will have to listen to 450 million Europeans in ways that it does not to 60 million Brits. Power respects power. </p> <p>It's interesting that one of the very few occasions on which the Blair government has publicly criticised the Bush administration is over US steel tariffs. And the tariffs were withdrawn. Why? Because the EU went to the World Trade Organisation and threatened counter- measures. Economically, the EU is a superpower. Power respects power. </p> <p>The other reason for us to change tack in this way is that, if we stand aside, much of continental Europe will try to define itself, under French leadership, as a rival to the United States. A lot of people on the British left would rather like that outcome. British Gaullism is a growing sect. Sitting in the Brighton conference hall on Tuesday, I was struck by the silence that greeted Blair's brief but heartfelt reaffirmation of the need for our alliance with the United States. That silence was not lukewarm. It was ice-cold. </p> <p>Yet on this, Blair is right. An anti-American unification of Europe will be no unification at all. There is no majority for it across the continent. The United States will be able to divide and rule. None of the great challenges of our time can be faced without Europe and America working together. Nothing could be more futile than to have these two great blocs of the rich and free squabbling while the rest of the world burns. The tragedy is that Blair's tactical misjudgment, in adopting the Jeeves approach to Bush's policy on Iraq, has imperilled his own strategic vision. </p> <p>Obviously we should keep engaging with the United States through all the many and intimate bilateral channels that have developed since 1941. But we must do these two other big things as well. What should start in Brighton today is not a violent, total reversal of British foreign policy, just a little velvet revolution. Its motto is clear: No More Jeeves.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freeworldweb.net\">www.freeworldweb.net</a></p>",
  "Rarely have delegates to a party conference had such potential to influence the course of history as they do today. In Labour's debate on the occupation of Iraq, the party will confront the biggest question facing the country: will Britain continue to follow the lead of President Bush, or will it change course and help to give the Iraqi people the chance to determine their own future? Ominously for the prospects of Labour and the government - as well as for the future of Iraq - it looks likely that delegates will vote to back the continued bloody occupation of the land of my birth to save the prime minister's political skin. <p>There are now two Iraq wars: the first is being fought with helicopter gunships and cluster bombs along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates; the second is being fought here in Britain and in the pre-election US. This is a propaganda war in which the hundreds of Iraqis killed every week by US bombardment fail to make the headlines, while the horrifying images provided by a Jordanian kidnapper and killer of British and US contractors is portrayed as the true face of Iraqi resistance. Thus the real human suffering, and the reality of the widespread resistance to occupation, is hidden from view, while bombing what US generals call Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's \"supporters' hideouts\" is portrayed as a necessity. And so Falluja, a besieged city of 300,000 people, is under daily aerial attack, and parts of Sadr City, the poorest neighbourhood of Baghdad, are being reduced to rubble. Many towns and villages across Iraq are encircled, and thousands of people arrested to crush popular resistance to occupation. </p> <p>The vast majority of Iraqis reject Zarqawi and his ilk - as do the resistance and its supporters in Falluja, Sadr City and across Iraq. Many even suspect that the occupation forces are somehow encouraging the likes of Zarqawi, or at least failing to prevent their crimes, as a way of obscuring the fact that most Iraqis now actively support a patriotic and widespread resistance movement. </p> <p> The occupation forces have admitted that the attacks on them by the resistance rose last month to 2,700. And how many of these 2,700 attacks a month were claimed by Zarqawi? Six. Six headline-grabbing, TV-dominating, stomach-churning moments. </p> <p>Just as Iraq's 25 million people were reduced, in the public's mind, to the threat from weapons of mass destruction, ready to be unleashed within 45 minutes, the resistance is now being reduced to a single hoodlum. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the name of building democracy, the Iraqi people's democratic rights have been crushed. Instead of an elected constitutional assembly we have a CIA-appointed puppet government. Trade union leaders have been detained by the occupation forces and their offices destroyed. The US proconsul Paul Bremer, and later the US-appointed Ayad Allawi regime, have reintroduced a 1987 law of Saddam's banning strikes in the state sector. </p> <p>Iraqi workers are nevertheless fighting back. Last month the Southern Oil Company Union staged a successful strike to halt oil exports and help force the US to lift its bombardment of Najaf. But Labour's conference will hear little or nothing of this, whether from Tony Blair and his ministers or from pro-occupation Iraqis masquerading as supporters of free trade unionism and self-determination in Iraq. </p> <p>Such insidious misrepresentation of reality helps keep people of conscience in Britain and the US from having sleepless nights about the children daily killed in their name or the trade unionists hounded by Saddamist torturers enlisted by the occupation. </p> <p>One might regret this \"collateral damage\", the government argues, but it is all in a good cause: fighting not against the Iraqi people, but to save them from Zarqawi. </p> <p>Britain is morally and politically responsible for the current US bombardment of Iraqi cities. Indeed, Britain's role in the war is now politically decisive. The announcement of a phased British withdrawal, to be completed by the end of the year, would be the desperately needed move to force President Bush to change direction. </p> <p>The impact of such a decision on the US public would be huge. Blair, speaking on behalf of the British people, played a key role in helping Bush dupe America about WMD. Were that support withdrawn, Bush would either have to change direction or risk losing the election. The impact on Democrat candidate Kerry's campaign would surely be no less dramatic, forcing him to accept that the Iraqi people's struggle for freedom is unstoppable. Once free, the Iraqi people would certainly sweep away Zarqawi's tiny gang, who appear to have little trouble slipping in and out of Iraq under the occupation regime. </p> <p>Labour delegates have it in their gift today to hold their leaders to account and uphold the cause of peace and self-determination. If they fail to seize that chance, we are all likely to pay the price. </p> <p>\u00b7 Sami Ramadani was a political refugee from Saddam Hussein's regime and is a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk\">sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Ever wondered how a US soldier explains to an Iraqi detainee that they are about to undergo a strip search? Till now, we assumed they cracked open a beer and produced their camera, but it turns out the method is way more sophisticated. The Diary has been passed a \"Visual Language Survival Guide\", made by a company called Kwikpoint and issued to both US military and contractors in the country as a means of non-verbal communication. There are several obvious strokes of genius, such as including a mushroom cloud and uranium symbol among the pictures one can point at to indicate what type of explosion has just occurred - sure to satisfy any stray survivors wondering why everything has gone a bit grey. But if we have to pick favourites, it's the three below. The first comes in the \"surrender\" category, and seems to be the pictograph for \"I wonder if you'd remove your toupee so I can search below it for concealed weapons\". The second's pretty straightforward, and hails from the \"booby traps\" section: \"The explosives are hidden under the dead goat.\" As for the last one - \"could you point me in the direction of the mass grave?\" - there really doesn't seem a lot to add at this stage. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Time now to catch up with an old friend, GLA chair Brian Coleman. The self-effacing Tory came to our attention back in April when he denied he was averse to the wrong kind of foreigners, forcing us to dig out an article he had written about 10 minutes earlier, calling for \"the influx of asylum seekers from countries which have no connection with Britain, such as Somalia, [to] be halted\". Since his elevation, he has been a force for change, most notably reinstating the gold chain formerly worn by the leader of the GLC. A delight, then, to spot another blow for Londoners in the minutes of the chair and chief executive's meeting of September 21. \"The chairman said that although cupboards full of silverware would be a liability,\" they note, \"he was inclined to seek the reputed mace...\" Oh dear. One can only guess at the inadequacy that drives him to it. Can't he just buy a Lotus like other chaps? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> No room, alas, for New Labour's latest edifying attempt to raise cash. We'll handle it tomorrow, so lay in the discomfort bags. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In the Mail, a surprising voice pipes up against police brutality. Simon Heffer, a copper's son himself, though hilariously coy about it, is furious. \"It is hard to think of an occasion in modern times,\" he wrote on Tuesday, \"or indeed at any time since the foundation of the Metropolitan police in 1829, when the constabulary has brought itself into greater dispute than it did...\". Now what historical incident do you think he cites next? Is it: a) the purging of over 300 corrupt Scotland Yard officers in the 70s; b) the moment the death toll in police custody in the last 30 years nudged 1,000, without a single conviction; or c) the business with the pro-hunting lobby in Westminster a fortnight ago? No clues, obviously. But way to win the argument, Heff! </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Finally, another contender for Best Adult Film Title.

  "<p>Arsenic trioxide, a weedkiller and the poison employed in many a crime novel, is demonstrating life-preserving qualities in the fight against cancer, scientists said yesterday. </p> <p>Promising results with patients were reported by researchers in Iran, who suggest the treatment could offer an alternative to chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). About 20,000 people worldwide a year are affected by APL, a cancer of the white blood cells that causes anaemia, bleeding and susceptibility to infection.</p> <p>The scientists at Tehran University of Medical Sciences believe it could work against other cancers, too. The arsenic compound is used for patients where other therapy has failed, but the researchers conducted trials using two courses of the drug as a first-line treatment on newly diagnosed patients.</p> <p>Of 63 patients treated, six have died, with a mean survival time for the others of 34 months. Most went into complete remission, but of the 11 who relapsed eight went into remission after a third course of treatment.</p> <p>The drug induces cell death and seems to correct the gene responsible for making the protein which causes APL.</p> <p>The five-year survival rate for patients receiving the current optimum treatment - chemotherapy plus a vitamin-A based substance, all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) - is between 60% and 80%. The researchers believe their results so far are comparable.</p> <p>Ardeshir Ghavamzadeh, of the team, who was unable to present his team's findings to a conference in Geneva, Switzerland, because of visa delays, said: \"There have been a few studies done using arsenic trioxide on a limited number of newly diagnosed patients, but we are the first group to suggest that it is acceptable as a first-line treatment.</p> <p>\"The results are comparable to ATRA with chemotherapy and in our study it has actually proved to be better than ATRA with chemotherapy. We now have the possibility of offering APL patients a new first-line treatment that avoids conventional chemotherapy. It also means that if we have this drug and other effective drugs such as ATRA ...available as well, most patients will be able to avoid the need for bone marrow transplants.\"</p> <p>Arsenic compounds were used in medicine by the Romans and ancient Chinese, and it was the Chinese in the 1980s who tried the substance against leukaemia after finding it was an active ingredient in traditional preparations.</p>",
  "Pensioners Mo and Graham Penson, from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, found themselves fingerprinted and photographed when they tried to re-enter America from Mexico in April. <p>They were detained for three hours and ordered to pay $195 (\u00a3110) each before being allowed back in. </p> <p>Mrs Penson, 66, said the couple had gone with an American friend to Laredo, near the border, and had been told by tourist information staff that simple photocopies of their passports were OK. </p> <p>The trio walked over a bridge to Mexico, paying 50 cents to pass through a turnstile. Nobody checked their documents. Upon their return, a US official sent them to another office. </p> <p>\"Another man looked me straight in the eye and said there were two options,\" said Mrs Penson. \"To either go and get our passports, or pay $195. </p> <p>\"We were three hours away from San Antonio ... and it would take six hours to make the return journey. \"They were just beastly. We were detained for three hours and we told them where we had come into America and when we were leaving - but they weren't interested ... When our friend tried to intervene they said: 'They speak English don't they? Let them speak for themselves.' </p> <p>\"It got to the point where we were photographed and fingerprinted. I was just so angry ... We got a receipt for the money. We were so bloody sick of them by this point.\" </p> <p>She added:\"We are an elderly English couple - my husband is 70.\" </p> <p>Mrs Penson has been in touch with Gwyneth Dunwoody, the MP campaigning for tourists not to be treated as criminals by US officials. \"I think American immigration is losing the plot and becoming too paranoid,\" she said. \"If they realised what damage they were doing - I only wish they would apologise. We were bitterly disappointed, as they are supposed to be our closest allies.\"</p>",
  "<p>The recent discovery of polar ice sheets on the moon reminds us that satellite Selene still has her secrets, but another of her mysteries has been visible from Earth for almost 500 years. </p> <p>In 1540, more than half a century before the first telescope was unveiled, stargazers in the German city of Worms saw a star-like object appear in the moon's north-eastern Calippus region. The Polish astronomer Hevelius in 1650 noted the appearance of a Mons Porphyrites, or \"red hill\", in the north-western crater Aristarchus. In April 1787, the astronomer Sir William Herschel saw so many red lights in this same crater that he thought he was witnessing a lunar volcano, and invited George III to take a look. </p> <p>More recently, Nasa records reveal several hundred spots and flashes of light, coloured glows, mists, unusual shapes and shadows have been observed on the lunar surface. They are known collectively as Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLP), a term coined by Sir Patrick Moore. </p> <p>Professional astronomers sniffed at these reports for many years, declaring them optical illusions or telescope errors. But a 1968 Nasa catalogue documented hundreds of sightings, the vast majority in and around Aristarchus. In July the following year, as Apollo 11 entered lunar orbit, earthbound German astronomers reported seeing a bright TLP in Aristarchus. Asked to check it out, Neil Armstrong noted unusual illumination in what he took to be the same crater. </p> <p>So is the moon, supposedly a lifeless chunk of basaltic rock, undergoing periodic volcanic activity? Most astronomers don't think so. In1963 Zdenek Kopal observed that a significant TLP event occurred during a major solar flare-up. He suggested particles from these vast electromagnetic emissions caused moon rocks to glow, particularly when the moon is passing through the Earth's magnetosphere. </p> <p>Another theory was put forward by Audouin Dollfus of the Paris Observatory in 1992. He identified glowing clouds emerging from Langrenus as moon dust, thrown up by underground gaseous emissions. The crater's surface is indeed cracked, and radon gas was detected in the atmosphere during the Apollo missions. Perhaps these moon burps are the source of some TLP, but it'll take another lunar landing to be sure.</p>"
