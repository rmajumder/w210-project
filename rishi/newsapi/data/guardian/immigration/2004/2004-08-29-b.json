  "<p>In a hushed and empty room, with the blinds shut against the afternoon sunshine, the Bogyman rocks slowly in his chair. His head hangs low in the murky light as he reads the words which describe his violent past. He smiles grimly when one of his new followers calls him \"the spawn of the devil\" and warns that he should \"brace himself for more abuse than any serial killer\". </p> <p>With five days left before the start of another rugby season, the squeamish and easily frightened should look away now. The arrival in England of Corne Krige, the former Springbok captain who is accused by many in this country of being the dirtiest player in international rugby, has already unleashed a wave of horror - and that's just among the supporters of his own team. </p> <p>\"I've seen this one,\" Krige says quietly as he waves a copy of an anguished article from a Northampton website. \"It's quite amusing. Listen to this: 'The hawks on the far right would happily embrace a Saints back-row of Corne Krige, Freddie Kruger and Osama bin Laden if it guaranteed us winning the Premiership, the Powergen Cup and the Heineken Cup.' I like that one. I want to win some trophies here.\" </p> <p>He is more sombre when reminded that a few Northampton \"doves\" have threatened to return their season-tickets this Saturday when he makes his debut at home to Bath. \"I'm expecting a lot of stick - and rightfully so. I made a lot of mistakes while playing for the Springboks in England and I'm ready for abuse from rival clubs. But I'm determined to win over every Saints fan. I'm ready to get stuck in and bleed for their cause.\" </p> <p>Krige has an endearing, if unfortunate, tendency to use the stirring language of battle even when promising to play clean and positive rugby. A desire to \"get stuck in\" and to bleed the green, black and yellow blood of Northampton inadvertently confirms his gruesome image. And yet, off the field, Krige is so charming and sincere that it is hard not to hope the Bogyman has been laid to rest forever. </p> <p>\"Part of the problem is that I'm not as big as most of these guys. I make up for it in aggression and play borderline rugby. Over the course of 40 games a season sometimes I step over that line. So it's inevitable there are a lot of reservations about me. People here have seen me on television in one game and they assume I'm always like that. So I'm not offended at comparisons with Freddie Kruger or even Bin Laden. I take that in the joking spirit it's meant. But I'm determined to change these preconceived ideas about me.\" </p> <p>His notoriety stems from November 2002 - when the Springboks lashed out savagely while losing 53-3 to England at Twickenham. Krige led the carnage as he attempted to smash his forearm into Matt Dawson - only to concuss his own team-mate, Andre Pretorious, by mistake. He then sank a knee into Lawrence Dallaglio, stamped on Phil Vickery and elbowed Jason Robinson in the face. </p> <p>\"I stepped totally out of line and I've got to take the criticism on the chin. People make mistakes in pressurised situations and that's what happened to me. My team was in dire straits and I allowed myself to be pushed into the wrong decisions.\" </p> <p>Krige is equally candid when asked whether his violence was premeditated. \"I have to admit that. We had just lost to France and Scotland so we knew there was no way we were going to beat England. We went out there to ruffle them up and get among them physically. One of my players got a red card early and things spiralled out of control. A lot of my guys gave up but I was determined to go down fighting. It was wrong but we were such a poor team there seemed no alternative. Half of that Springbok side never came close to playing Test rugby again. </p> <p>\"It's ironic that when England took a weakened team to New Zealand this year they also got a player [Simon Shaw] sent off early and were beaten badly. Maybe they now appreciate what we were up against. At Northampton it'll be interesting to talk to Ben Cohen and Steve Thompson and get their perspective as England players. I've obviously seen them since arriving and things seem fine - but I know England players at other clubs might hold a grudge against me.\" </p> <p>That animosity is most obvious in the case of Dawson - who has just left Northampton for Wasps. In his deliberately provocative autobiography, the England scrum-half ridiculed Krige as South Africa's \"thug-in-chief\". </p> <p>\"Matt Dawson is quite outspoken,\" Krige says dryly, \"but I still felt honoured to get a mention in his book. I've heard the rumours that Dawson left Northampton because of me - but I think it was more a contractual situation between him and the club. I would definitely have come to Saints even if Dawson had stayed. If we'd played together and got to know each other over a few beers, then maybe we would've both changed our attitude. </p> <p>\"I'm more encouraged by Martin Johnson. I said some things about him [Krige described Johnson as the dirtiest captain in Test rugby] but we sorted it out, face to face, and he doesn't bear any grudges. There's real quality to his character. And of course he understands rugby and I think he knows Twickenham was a one-off situation.\" </p> <p>Krige has both the eloquence and the determination to become a little more saintly. It is also conceivable that, away from the trials of Test rugby, he could emerge as one of the most commanding players in this season's Premiership. In the process he will provide a personal reminder that, despite England's World Cup win, the southern hemisphere countries are burning to regain their traditional domination of world rugby. </p> <p>\"I think one of the reasons England have been so successful in recent years is down to the quality of the Premiership. It's intensely competitive and provided the basis of a very good English World Cup-winning side. But sport moves in cycles and England, without Johnson and Jonny Wilkinson, look much more vulnerable. Even with Wilkinson back, they might still struggle a little. The All Blacks and Springboks have taken big strides forward. I think that, at the moment, England are only somewhere in the top four. I'd probably pick New Zealand as the world's best team - just - but the Boks are now right behind them.\" </p> <p>The painful irony for Krige is that South Africa, under new coach Jake White, are now a far happier and more fluid team - and beat New Zealand and Australia this month while winning their first Tri-Nations in six years. </p> <p>\"When I heard about Jake's appointment I couldn't believe it. I thought we'd hit a new low. I just didn't see him as an international coach - but I was very wrong. He's done an amazing job in revitalising Springbok rugby.\" </p> <p>Krige admits to recently \"being really emotional and wondering if I had done the right thing in quitting Test rugby. I was still only 28 when I stood down this year. That's quite young in an English context but I'd just had enough. The constant criticism was not only wearing me down. It was affecting my wife, Justine, and that's when it was time to get out. </p> <p>\"I was unlucky to fall between two eras. I played a little for Nick Mallett who was a sophisticated coach, and the Springboks are now starting to regain some of those same qualities. But I won the bulk of my 39 caps under a much more conservative regime during one of the worst slumps in South African rugby. As captain I was under enormous emotional and psychological strain. When you lead the Springboks and things go well then it's wonderful. But when things go badly the bitterness is almost unprecedented. The only other comparison is with the All Blacks. But New Zealanders tell me they can't believe the negativity and anger we face in South Africa.\" </p> <p>That grim era was encapsulated by the Springboks' preparations for last year's World Cup. Deep in the bush, at \"Camp Barbwire\", players were ritually humiliated and stripped naked at gunpoint. \"That camp only lasted three days - but they were the longest three days of my life. The worst moment was when all the players were thrown into a dark pit. They poured ice-cold water over us and played the British and New Zealand anthems. It was very demoralising as they tried to break us down.\" </p> <p>As part of Krige's cathartic attempt to confront his demons, he admits to his own culpability in that grotesque exercise. \"I regret not challenging our coach [Rudolf Straeuli]. Before the World Cup he came to me, Joost [van der Westhuizen] and John Smit [the new Springbok captain]. Straeuli said he was thinking about running a military camp before we went to Australia but wanted our input. And we, rather naively, said, 'Sure, why not?' It seemed a good idea to get away from the press and go out into the bush. It turned out to be a huge mistake. </p> <p>\"It was classic military intimidation. I remember one point when, as captain, I decided enough was enough. We had been made to stand naked in cold water for so long that a lot of the guys were suffering from hypothermia. I led the team out of the water. But the camp was being run by these guys from the Special Forces who drove us back into the water. We had been told beforehand that anyone who didn't survive the camp would not make it to the World Cup. So we gave in. But it would be wrong to use that as an excuse and say that's why we lost to England and New Zealand in the World Cup.\" </p> <p>After the insanity of Camp Barbwire it's easy to understand why Krige can look forward to the spleen of Welford Road or Kingsholm with equanimity. </p> <p>\"You know what they say about tough times. If you survive them they make you a stronger and better person. I've come out of a long tunnel and it's time to start a new life. I've not just been through all this shit to now roll over. I'm determined to make a new reputation in the northern hemisphere.\" </p> <p>He may never become Saint Corne, but Krige will play for Northampton with a yearning for redemption. He points again to the website clipping which imagined him forming a terrifying backrow with Kruger and Bin Laden. </p> <p>\"I read that whole piece and, in the end, the guy starts talking about his own kids. Me and Justine are about to have our first baby in February. So I lingered over those last lines where this ordinary Northampton supporter writes that he wants his kids to grow up 'brave and tough and decent and fair'. And his last line is that he wants me to become their benchmark. That's very humbling. The guy is reserving judgment on me. He's giving me a chance to show that I'm not the person he once imagined. That's a wonderful opportunity for me. I intend to take it.\"</p>",
  "<p>All the disappointments, traumas and general low points of the past 10 years suddenly did not seem to matter any more to Kelly Holmes yesterday. </p> <p>It is surely unprecedented that any athlete has turned their career round so dramatically in the space of just six gloriously uplifting days. At the start of the week Holmes, at 34 and who by her own admission had considered retiring on several occasions, seemed destined to be remembered as a good runner who never quite fulfilled her potential due to injury. </p> <p>By the end of it she was appearing on the front page of every Sunday newspaper in Britain and being hailed as the greatest female athlete in the country's history after adding the 1500 metres gold medal to the one she had won over 800m the previous Monday. </p> <p>She admitted that if she did not have the gold medals to keep staring at she probably would not believe it was true. </p> <p>\"I don't think I'm coming to terms with it at the moment,\" said Holmes. \"I have been looking at my gold medal [from the 800m] every day and tears have been my filling my eyes. I was thinking 'Oh, my God, I've already got one gold medal and I just want this over and done with'. I just wanted to celebrate but I'd focused so much on getting another one. My career has been such a roller-coaster but I just kept sticking in there and I knew in my heart that there was something in there for me to fulfil my dreams.\" </p> <p>Holmes's lowest moment had come in the same stadium in 1997 when, fresh from setting a United Kingdom 1500m record, she arrived at the world championships as the favourite, only to injure her achilles tendon and fail to complete her heat. </p> <p>It was that record she broke as she swept to glory on Saturday when, after running another perfectly judged race, she ran 3min 57.90sec to become the first Briton to complete the middle-distance distance double since Albert Hill in 1920 and emulate Svetlana Masterkova of Russia at the games in Atlanta in 1996 and Tatyana Kazankina of the then Soviet Union in Montreal 20 year earlier. </p> <p>\"If you had told me I had to run that time to win a medal I wouldn't have turned up,\" Holmes said. \"The 1500m has been a psychological barrier for me. I knew I was stronger than I've ever been, but it's what goes on in your head that counts. I knew when I won the 800m that I had to be as confident as possible and that this would be my only chance to do what I have done.\" </p> <p>Among those queuing up to hail Holmes's achievement was Sebastian Coe, the man who in 1980 and 1984 had come close to pulling off a similar double but on each occasion had won only silver in the 800m. </p> <p>\"She has gone through each race without putting a foot wrong,\" he said. \"Really it was textbook middle-distance running, it has just been perfect. In historic terms, and athletics terms, what Kelly did was absolutely supreme.\" </p> <p>Holmes, who had received her 800m gold from Coe, said: \"Sebastian Coe was my idol for years. He was an inspiration when I was younger and to be mentioned in the same breath as him is unbelievable.\" </p> <p>Coe had written a newspaper article in 2001 in which he claimed Holmes was a \"Rolls Royce athlete being given back-street servicing\" and that was what had contributed to her failure to turn all that potential into gold medals. </p> <p>With national lottery funding, however, Holmes received the best medical back-up leading into these games. Alison Rose, a UK Athletics physiotherapist, was available to fly to South Africa to treat her while she was training, and Bryan English, the team doctor, was on hand during the pre-Olympic training camp at the Aphrodite Hills in Cyprus to monitor her closely. </p> <p>\"Taking on both races was going to be physically and psychologically very demanding so I sat down with the medical team and worked out the best way of recovering,\" Holmes said. \"Each morning I would get my protein drink ready, my carbohydrate drink ready and my rehydration drink ready and put them in the fridge. Then I would get my food ready which the doctor would give me when he saw me after the race. </p> <p>\"I suddenly thought that the first person I would see after the heats was Sally Gunnell when she interviewed me for the BBC, so I sent her a text asking her to bring me a bag of nuts. She did and so I was munching and drinking, and that was good because the recovery process had started. </p> <p>\"I then went to the warm-down track, had a massage, got on the bus back to the village, had more food and then into the ice bin. I kept to that routine because it felt so right for me to do it and I was recovering quickly which was crucial. </p> <p>\"After the first heat of the 800m, the races were always around the same time so I stuck to the same routine. I left for the track at the same time, I kept wearing my Team GB dog-tag around my neck and it became my lucky charm, kissing it. </p> <p>\"When I went to the warm-up track I would listen to Alicia Keys singing 'If I ain't got you' and applied the words to the gold medal I wanted. I sang it as I warmed up and it brought tears to my eyes because I was dreaming of a gold medal. When I eventually got it, I kept the same routine for the 1500m. I cried before I left to run the 800m final because it was either going to be my dream or it would all go wrong, and I cried again before the 1500m - I have been an emotional wreck.\" </p> <p>For all her bravado and confidence that has sometimes bordered on arrogance, Holmes was fundamentally a runner lacking self-belief before these Olympics. </p> <p>Even when the likes of Coe and Steve Cram were urging her to double up she doubted her own ability to succeed. Holmes declared she would run the 800m only 48 hours before the opening round. </p> <p>\"I knew I was in the fittest shape of my life but I still needed that self-belief. So I started texting my old coach Dave Arnold because he knows me so well and telling him what times I was doing in the training sessions and he ended up saying it was 'bloody fantastic' and that I had to go for it.\" </p> <p>Undoubtedly it was the best piece of advice that Holmes had ever received.</p> <p><strong>Other British Olympians who can hold a candle to Kelly</strong></p> <p><strong> Ann Packer</strong><br> </p> <p> Britain's Packer had already taken a silver medal in the 400m in Tokyo in 1964 but there were echoes of Kelly Holmes when, with some 80 metres to go, she put in an exceptional winning kick to pass France's Maryvonne Dupureur and won the 800m by some five metres. Packer had been helped by the fact that the then unofficial world record holder Dan Shin-geum was missing for political reasons and the official world record holder Dixie Willis could not run because of illness. Unlike Holmes, Packer, who had finished third in her semi-final, had not been confident of success in the final and had planned to go shopping. </p> <p><strong> Mary Rand</strong><br> </p> <p> In Rome in 1960 Mary Rand, then Mary Bignal, was hot favourite for the long jump but had to settle for ninth place. Four years later four of her six jumps were her best ever and Rand took gold, the first British woman to win in track and field at an Olympics. But she did not settle for that and later in the week also took silver in the pentathlon and bronze in the 4x100m relay. She later married again, this time to the American decathlete Bill Toomey. </p> <p><strong> Sebastian Coe</strong><br> </p> <p> In the days when Britain's men ruled the world of middle-distance running Coe won the 1500 metres at the Moscow Games in 1980 when his greatest rival Steve Ovett had to settle for bronze and made a successful defence of the title in Los Angeles four years later when Steve Cram was beaten into second place. Coe also won 800m silver in Moscow when Ovett took gold in one of the most eagerly awaited confrontations in Olympic history and Coe ran \"the worst race of my life\". Coe later became a Tory MP and nowadays, as Lord Coe, is the chairman of London's Olympic bid for 2012. </p> <p><strong> Steve Redgrave</strong><br> </p> <p> After his fourth gold in Atlanta in 1996 Steve Redgrave had begged anyone seeing him in a boat to shoot him. Four years later Redgrave, the greatest rower in Olympic history, defied the passage of time and all logic to help the coxless four to a memorable gold medal. The 38-year-old Redgrave was knighted after a race in which Britain led from start to finish although they were pushed by the Italian crew. One of the four, Matthew Pinsent, may yet emulate Redgrave in 2008. </p> <p><strong> Bradley Wiggins</strong><br> </p> <p> The pale-faced Londoner made his little bit of Olympic history last week when he became the first Briton since 1964 to take three medals in a single Olympics. Wiggins had won gold in the individual pursuit, silver in the team pursuit and followed it with a bronze in the madison event with his partner Rob Hayles. Hayles fell off his bike midway through the event.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's first call centre travel agency exclusively for gay men and lesbians is offering Texan rodeos, Caribbean cruises, ski trips and Prague city breaks in a bid to extend 'pink tourism' beyond the likes of Sitges, Ibiza and Mykonos. </p> <p>The founders of Outlet 4 Travel were inspired by the success of dedicated gay agencies in the US. 'Most gay men and women have to spend a lot of time looking on the internet to book a holiday, unless they want to go to the usual places,' said Glenn Davidson. 'They have to put it together themselves, which often works out more expensive.' </p> <p>Davidson's business partner, Paula Sullivan, added: 'Some [gay travellers] just don't feel comfortable walking into a high street travel agents. It's OK in London or Brighton but not in other parts of the country.' </p> <p>She said attempts by some major travel companies to break into this niche market had not been successful. 'Gay and lesbian holidays are very specific. You have to fully understand their needs and wants. In the research we did, customers said they had encountered the odd person who was making innuendos and trying to be funny, which they weren't happy with.' </p> <p>The company, launched at Manchester's Gay Pride Festival this weekend, is also offering trips to Vallarta in Mexico and Rio de Janeiro, an exclusively gay resort in Sardinia and packages to the Montreal Black and Blue Festival. It is also selling packages to Bangkok Pride and the Sydney Mardi Gras. 'We're trying to build on gay events but not just the obvious ones,' said Davidson. 'We've put together a gay ski week where we're taking over a whole resort, and we're going to offer commitment ceremonies in Thailand. We will also package holidays for groups of gay and straight friends.' </p> <p>A member of the Freedom Travel Group consortium, the agency has negotiated good insurance deals for cohabiting couples who have found it difficult to get joint insurance with other companies. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Outlet 4 Travel (0845 226 0019; <a href=\"http://www.outlet4travel.com\">www.outlet4travel.com</a>)</p>",
  "<p>Ian Wynne powered home to win bronze in the K1 500 metre final, but he must have wondered if it could have been silver or even gold. </p> <p>'I slipped on a kerb getting off the bus,' he said, 'and twisted my ankle.' </p> <p>Wynne spent the night with an ice pack on his leg and was on crutches as he prepared to go afloat, but was reluctant to claim it had affected his race. 'Once we got going I didn't think about it. I just focussed on the race.' </p> <p>But the 31-year-old did acknowledge that the injury had disrupted his preparation for the single kayak event. </p> <p>'It was painful warming up and I was pretty unbalanced off the start.' </p> <p>Wynne was in sixth place coming up to the halfway point of the race, when he began to move up strongly on the leaders. 'It wasn't the perfect race like the heat and semi-final, but I adapted to it.' </p> <p>He had qualified for the final, by winning his heat, picking up the form he showed in May when he won silver at the European championships. </p> <p>He also made it to the K2 1000m final on Friday, racing with Paul Darby Dowman. The pair finished seventh. </p> <p>'That wasn't a fair representation of what we can do,' Wynne said. 'And I wanted to make amends in the K1.' </p> <p>Afterwards he suggested that he still had some unfinished business. 'I want the upgrade,' he told his coach Eric Farrell. 'Next time I hope to win the gold.' </p> <p>Britain's flatwater kayakers had hoped to emulate the success of the British rowers in Athens. Wynne was 0.1 of a second behind second-placed Nathan Baggaley of Australia and half a second off Canada's Adam van Koeverden, who won gold. In the K2 they were two-and-a-half seconds off first place. </p> <p>Dr Tim Brabants, who won Britain's first ever medal in flatwater kayaking, taking bronze in Australia, finished fifth in the K1 1000m final, failing to match his performance in the heats when he recorded a wind-assisted, unofficial, world-best time. </p> <p>'Tim is the talisman of the team,' said Paul Owen, chief executive of the British Canoeing Federation. 'He's been the backbone of our sprint canoeing and it was a disappointment not to see him on the podium. But sometimes the rhythm isn't quite right.' </p> <p>Lucy Hardy, 24, came in seventh in the women's K1 500m event, while Germany's 42-year-old Birgit Fischer won her eighth Olympic title in the K2 1000m.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>All my shopping list says is 'something for the grill'. Followed by a scribbled note to check I have anchovies, rosemary, garlic and lemon. I don't have any particular meat or fish or vegetable in mind. All that matters are the seasonings - strong, robust, heady - that along with the smoke from the grill give food an unmistakable sense of high summer. </p> <p>I settle on a fat fillet of monkfish from Rowley Leigh's fish shop at the top of Kensington Church Street. It costs 20 quid but is meaty and spanking fresh, its pearlescent skin glistening on the ice. It will feed four of us. Although it is not on my list, I also pick up a couple of handfuls of samphire while I'm there. </p> <p>At home I cut the fish into thick chunks and toss it with lemon and olive oil, anchovies, garlic and needles of rosemary. Covered and in the fridge, it will stay happily for two or three hours without harm. On the grill I will let the edges singe so that the flavour of the smoke permeates the fish. Of course it could have been a fillet of Welsh lamb, a halved aubergine, a pile of long whiskered prawns. Smoke, garlic, lemon and salt - the tastes of August cooking. #</p> <p>I want to crank up the flavours for tonight's meal even more, so I will make a bowl of garlic mayonnaise, too, quite a pungent version made with four fat cloves of garlic to two egg yolks, a good 300ml of peppery olive oil and the juice of half a lemon to create a slovenly texture. </p> <p>I have never been convinced of the need to serve soups chilled in the summer - the exception is a good vichyssoise or a cucumber and prawn soup in shades of soft green and girlie pink. But today I want something more strident, something with long flavours. I find that if you roast tomatoes before you make them into a soup the flavour of the fruit becomes fuller and the soup takes on a more Mediterranean feel. I puree the soup, but leave a goodly amount of roasted tomatoes whole, chopping them roughly and piling them in the centre of the dish. That way the soup has body. </p> <p>Such a butch meal needs a softer ending. My plan was a tart made of greengages embedded in an almond filling, the sort you find in chi-chi pastry shops, but so meltingly ripe were the fruits that I hadn't the heart to cook them. To contrive them into a dessert would have felt like arguing with God. Instead I chilled them and presented them on a pottery platter, a leaf or two tucked artfully among them (once a food stylist, always a food stylist) and served them with shockingly cold glasses of eau de vie that had sat in the freezer for a few hours. Another meal to remember. </p> <p><strong>Roast tomato soup with basil and olive oil toasts</strong><br>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>800g deep-flavoured tomatoes<br>1 red pepper<br>2 fat cloves garlic<br>3 tbsp olive oil <br>1 litre of vegetable stock<br>a small bunch of basil<br>French bread for toasting</strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Cut each tomato into six and put them in a roasting tin. Halve the pepper, pull out the seeds and white core and discard, then cut the pepper into six or so pieces and add to the tomatoes. Peel and roughly chop the garlic, add to the tomatoes then pour over the olive oil. Season generously with salt and black pepper, then roast for 45 minutes or so until the tomatoes are soft, and the skin lightly blackened in places. Make the cro\u00fbtes by slicing the bread thinly and toasting under the grill. Set aside.</p> <p>Pour the stock in the pan. Pull the basil leaves from the stems and add them to the pan, then bring briefly to the boil on the hob. Liquidise most of the mixture, pouring the liquidised soup into a bowl, leaving a couple of handfuls of tomatoes and pepper behind. Drain them of any liquid, putting it back into the soup, then chop the tomato and pepper finely. Correct the seasoning. Pile a quarter of the chopped tomato and pepper in the centre of each of four bowls, then ladle the soup around it. Float the toast on top, then drizzle with olive oil. </p> <p><strong>Grilled monkfish with rosemary</strong><br>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>800g monkfish fillet<br>3 bushy sprigs of rosemary<br>4 anchovy fillets<br>2 large or 4 small cloves of garlic<br>a large lemon<br>3 tbsp olive oil<br>a lemon to serve</strong></p> <p>Pull the leaves from the rosemary stalks and chop them finely, then tip them into a bowl large enough to take the fish. Rinse the anchovy fillets then smash them to a rough pulp with the flat edge of your chopping knife. Peel the garlic, crush it flat then smash it to a puree in the same way. Stir together the herb, anchovy and garlic, adding a grinding of black pepper and a little salt (the anchovies are quite salty). Halve the lemon, squeeze it into the other ingredients then slowly blend in the olive oil until you have a green, fragrant slush. </p> <p>If the fishmonger hasn't removed all the pearly membrane from the fish, peel it away with your fingers. It is edible, but hardly pretty after cooking. Slice the fish into two long, thick strips, then cut each one into four roughly equal pieces. </p> <p>Push the fish down into the marinade, turning them over in the oil. It will not cover them. Cover the bowl then put it in the fridge for a minimum of an hour, maximum of three. </p> <p>Get the grill hot. Lift the monkfish from the marinade and set them on the grill. They will take a good 5 minutes on each side - check it is cooked through. As the fish comes off the grill, season with more salt and a good squeeze of lemon at the table. </p> <p><strong>New potatoes with samphire</strong><br>You only need a very light dressing on this so as not to confuse the garlic mayonnaise. </p> <p><strong>650g new potatoes<br>150g samphire<br>olive oil, red wine vinegar</strong></p> <p>Scrub the potatoes. Cook them in boiling, lightly salted water (you will mix them with the samphire, which is quite salty), then drain them. Refill the pan with water, bring to the boil then add the samphire for just a minute. Toss the warm potatoes with the drained samphire, then add 2 teaspoons of red wine vinegar and 3 tablespoons olive oil. The potatoes will absorb much of the vinegar and oil.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "An Algerian in his late thirties walks nervously into a prison chapel at Woodhill high-security jail in Milton Keynes. For some reason, the authorities have decided that a Christian place of worship is the best place for this devout Muslim to tell his story. <p>But the venue is the least of the problems for Mr A, who has been certified by Home Secretary David Blunkett as a terrorist: an Islamist extremist with links to Chechen rebels, Algerian armed groups and at least one known al-Qaeda suspect held in Britain. </p> <p>We cannot name Mr A because his anonymity is protected by a court order to guarantee the safety of his family in Britain and Algeria. Along with 11 other foreign detainees incarcerated under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, he exists in a penal no-man's-land and can be kept in jail indefinitely. </p> <p>He is charged with no offence by a British police officer, convicted of no crime by a jury, but judged such a risk to the public by MI5, the security service, that he can be detained until Blunkett judges the 'war on terror' is over. No hard evidence has to be produced to back the intelligence service claims. </p> <p>'Just imagine a British man held indefinitely in Algeria,' he says. 'This is a slow death and they are destroying my mind.' </p> <p>Dressed in a green T-shirt, beige chinos and trainers, Mr A looks tidy and well groomed. Close-cropped beard and neat, curly black hair also suggest he is keeping body and soul together. But throughout the two-hour interview one leg jigs unconsciously with nervous ten sion, a sign of the well-documented trauma which comes from indefinite detention. </p> <p>Unlike convicted terrorists, who leave prison at the end of their sentences, this father of five could be in jail for ever. </p> <p>After two-and-a-half years in custody, Mr A has finally been authorised to talk to the press after a long legal battle by The Observer and the Guardian; he is the first detainee held in a high-security prison to do so. He has not been interrogated by police or the intelligence services about his activities. Neither has he been told what evidence they possess for his alleged links to international terrorists. </p> <p>The paradoxes of his situation are multiple. He has been detained without trial precisely because there is not enough evidence against him to bring before the courts. He cannot be deported because the UK authorities judge he would be at risk of torture or death if he returned to Algeria, yet can choose to return voluntarily to his home country whenever he wishes. He is a certified international terrorist, but he can choose to leave for a country other than Algeria if one will accept him. </p> <p>The case against Mr A was discussed in May in open sessions of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), the tribunal that deals with deportation cases involving national security issues. At its heart was the allegation that he supported the Chechen struggle against the Russian government, a claim Mr A does not deny. </p> <p>According to witnesses, Mr A provided boots, a sleeping bag and satellite phone equipment to the rebels in the breakaway Caucasus republic. It was even admitted that such support would not have been classed as terrorism before the suicide attacks in America. Intelligence officers pointed out that, had the equipment been provided to Chechen separatists themselves, then Mr A would not have been committing a crime. But they claimed that, as the boots and sleeping bag were destined for a small group of Arab fighters with known links to al-Qaeda, his actions do constitute international terrorism. </p> <p>Mr A remains proud of the work he did for the Chechen cause: 'Because of the conflict, people are driven from their homes. It is our duty to help them. We sent many things, not just boots - clothing for the poor and needy.' </p> <p>The government claims Mr A also associated with known Islamist extremists and supports militant groups in Algeria, which he violently denies. </p> <p>Last October, SIAC decided that Mr A had procured material for Arab Islamists fighting in Chechnya and was a supporter of an extremist faction in Algeria and concluded: 'We have reasonable grounds for believing that A is an international terrorist as defined by the 2001 Act and for believing that his presence in the United Kingdom is a risk to national security.' </p> <p>Mr A says: 'I am not a terrorist, but I am a member of a group: five kids and a wife.' </p> <p>He just wants to talk about his family. He has not seen his teenage daughters for two years and does not like his wife and younger children visiting him in prison. </p> <p>'Imagine this environment for anyone who has not done any crime. I was scared even to bring [my family] to prison. It will have a great impact seeing all the officers and dogs.' </p> <p>Mr A's wife, a European convert to Islam, has been diagnosed as clinically depressed. His children have become desperate. In a letter to their 'Abee' (Daddy) this month, they wrote: 'It is unfair for you to be there, and we wish you were here to look after us. We dream about you a lot and you've been there for too long and we need you here so much. Inshallah, you'll arrive home soon and our family will be complete again.' </p> <p>Mr A says his children have told him that almost every night they dream of seeing him walking through the door. He claims they are still traumatised by the dawn raid in December 2001, when they were woken to see their father dragged off to prison. His wife was eight months pregnant and, despite begging that he be allowed to stay until she gave birth, he was taken to the Belmarsh high-security prison in London and has been in jail ever since. </p> <p>He finds it particularly difficult not to see his youngest son, born while he was in custody, and finds the child's rare visits with his mother deeply upsetting: 'My son doesn't know me. He screams when he sees me. I can't hold him and can't hug him because he is screaming all the time.' </p> <p>Mr A himself, in common with many other detainees, is on antidepressants. Already Abu Rideh, a Palestinian prisoner, has been transferred to Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital, and three other detainees at Belmarsh are said to be in a state of serious psychiatric collapse. </p> <p>Belmarsh and Woodhill have been described as 'Britain's Guantanamo', but Mr A says the everyday living conditions are not the problem: 'They look after you, give you a cell on your own. But is it me or my family who is punished? They have driven my wife mad.' </p> <p>The problem for Mr A is the unknowns. How long will he be held? What is happening to his family? As a certified terrorist, will anyone who tries to help him be labelled an extremist in their turn? 'If they cannot try me in a court of law, give me other options. Just let me be somewhere with my family.' </p> <p>In his desperation, Mr A has decided that he may even now risk torture or death to return to Algeria if he fails to get bail at his next attempt. He says his fellow detainees have been shocked by his decision because of the danger he and his family will face on their return. But he can no longer bear being separated from his family. </p> <p>He comes from near the eastern Algerian coastal city of Annaba, close to the Tunisian border, hard hit by the civil war between the government and Islamists which has cost more than 100,000 lives. 'It's a beautiful town by the sea,' he says. 'I can't wait.' </p> <p>Incredibly, his family in Algeria does not know he is in prison. He still speaks to them regularly over the phone from Woodhill and tells them everything is all right. When relatives ask to speak to the children, he says he is calling from the office. </p> <p>He knows that he will be questioned by the authorities when he arrives in Algeria, but says anything will be preferable to not knowing his fate: 'In Algeria there is a proper legal system. All these political games are not for me. I want to find a way of being with my family. I want to leave this civilisation.' </p> <p>Blunkett has argued that 11 September 2001 necessitated a new approach to the threat of international terrorism and that the legislation which followed was a response to the exceptional circumstances now faced in the war against terror. </p> <p>Yet supporters of the detainees point out that in their 30 months of detention no attempt was made to debrief any of them about what they might know, despite allegedly being some of the most dangerous international terrorists in Britain. </p> <p>Two months ago each man received a letter from the Home Office asking if he would be prepared to co-operate with MI5. The letter, dated 3 June, states: 'The security service would welcome the opportunity to discuss any knowledge you may have of international terrorism in the United Kingdom or overseas.' </p> <p>So far, no one has agreed to co-operate because no one admits to being a terrorist. </p> <p>Mr A says he is grateful to the British people who have campaigned for the detainees and was particularly touched by a Nottingham priest who spoke against indefinite imprisonment in a service. </p> <p>Asked what he would like the British people to know about the detainees, whose names they are not even allowed to know, Mr A says: 'The government you vote for is a democratic government, but is abusing its power. It holds people without trial and without sentence for an indefinite period. They have damaged our children and wives.' </p> <p>He says he would still like to see his children grow up in Britain, but knows that the chance is fading by the day. </p> <p>'I cannot see my family destroyed under my eyes. I divorce you, Britain,' he says, before leaving the chapel for his cell.</p>",
  "A court in Paris is expected to issue an international arrest warrant tomorrow against former extremist Cesare Battisti, wanted for extradition to Italy despite having been granted asylum in France 19 years ago. <p>Battisti vanished 10 days ago and the Italian media and government have been scathing about 'superior' Parisians and 'incompetent' police who are accused of allowing him to escape vanish 10 days ago. </p> <p>The case has starkly divided the Parisian elite. On the right bank, at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, President Jacques Chirac says Battisti deserves no more clemency than an Islamic terrorist. On the left, the 49-year-old fugitive-turned-author is seen as the victim of a gross miscarriage of justice. </p> <p>Battisti claims the Italian convictions in absentia against him for three murders and one for complicity to murder - during Italy's bloody 'Years of Lead' - are flawed.</p>",
  "<p>At immigration control in Los Angeles airport a couple of weeks ago, I submitted to the bureaucratic ordeal that now routinely greets British visitors to America. When I finally convinced the customs officer that I was not seeking employment, asylum or the destruction of the free world, she asked me who it was I had come to interview. Tim Robbins, I replied. 'But,' she said, a look of bemusement lending sudden animation to her expressionless face, 'he hasn't got a movie coming out.' I told her that I was there to talk to him about a play he had written. 'Right,' she nodded, then supplied a little cautionary advice: 'Just don't be taken in by his politics.'</p> <p>Only in America is it no surprise to find a state official who is aware of a film actor's latest output, and only in America would that actor's political pronouncements inspire that official to issue a warning, almost as a condition of entry. It's hard to overstate the prominence of movie stars in US culture. It's often been said that they are the nearest equivalent to royalty and, as with the royal family here, they can be forgiven almost anything but an opinion.</p> <p>On the whole, Americans will accept their politicians behaving like actors - thus Ronald Reagan became president and Arnold Schwarzenegger has morphed from Terminator to governor of California without a noticeable diminution in respect for his abilities - but they don't much like their actors coming on like politicians. And Robbins, a vociferous opponent of the war in Iraq, is seen by many of his fellow citizens as way too political. </p> <p>Dating back through 'Hanoi' Jane Fonda's exploits in the anti-Vietnam War movement to the McCarthy witch-hunt in the Fifties, there is something about so-called Hollywood liberals - the disjunction perhaps of pampered multimillionaires identifying with the oppressed peoples of the world - that brings froth to the mouths of many middle Americans, and in particular conservative media commentators. With the possible exception of Michael Moore, no one winds up radio talk-show hosts quite as reliably as Robbins.</p> <p>At the same time, for a certain kind of progressive cosmopolitan, Robbins is a hero, a man who speaks his mind regardless of the ensuing vilification. With his partner, the actress Susan Sarandon, he has often criticised the American government, both Democrat and Republican. A few years ago, he and Sarandon used their spot at an Oscars ceremony to bring attention to the plight of Haitian immigrants with HIV interned at Guantanamo Bay. The fuss that caused was more 'Here he goes again'. No one really questioned his patriotism.</p> <p>Last year, however, the couple was disinvited to the Baseball Hall of Fame's celebration to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the film Bull Durham, the baseball comedy in which Robbins met Sarandon. Robbins saw it as a concerted attempt to inhibit free speech. As if to prove that he won't be gagged by the threats to his social life, he has written a play called Embedded, a satire which mocks the compliant role of the American media in its coverage of the invasion of Iraq and takes broad aim at sinister forces within the Bush administration.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the play will be staged in London, having already drawn sell-out audiences in New York and Los Angeles. When I met up with Robbins at the Sony Pictures studio lot in Culver City, he was in the middle of editing a video of the play that is to be shown at the Venice Film Festival. </p> <p>At 6ft 4in, and 45 years of age, Robbins maintains an unlikely but inseparable relationship with the adjective 'boyish'. Though his hair is now more salt than pepper, and his fleshy protean features appear to have belatedly set, there's something elastic in the way he holds himself, not quite gangly but unmistakably youthful. It's in his smile, however, a shy heartwarming gesture that you can never see quite enough of, that his adolescence is most effectively preserved.</p> <p>Part of the reason that you want more of the smile is that Robbins, for all his comic ability, can be self-consciously serious. He makes it clear that he doesn't go in for Hollywood gossip. Indeed, he takes every opportunity to remind me that he doesn't go in for Hollywood. He and Sarandon and their three children live in the more bohemian environment of downtown New York. </p> <p>For all his size, he does not occupy space like a celebrity. There's no force field of fame. He's approachable, if not particularly accessible. He wears jeans and a T-shirt with the legend 'The Actors Gang', the theatre group he founded in the early Eighties. The son of Gil Robbins, a member of the Highwaymen folk group, Robbins developed his twin interests in theatre and politics at an early age. He went on anti-Vietnam War marches as a kid and, when a teenager, set up an improvisational troupe with his sisters called Theatre of the New City. One of their productions was a satire on Watergate.</p> <p>He studied drama at UCLA and moved swiftly into TV with parts in soaps like St Elsewhere. His progress in film was not so rapid. It was not until he was 30 that his gawky charm was properly captured in Bull Durham. But it was Robert Altman's Hollywood satire The Player, in which he played a slick, paranoid studio executive, that his lead potential was seen. He then went on to write and direct and star in a political mockumentary, Bob Roberts, in which he played a folk-singing right-wing political candidate, an achievement that led Altman to suggest that he could be 'the next Orson Welles'. Since then, he's directed the acclaimed Dead Men Walking and starred in an impressive range of films, from the Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy to the slow-burn hit The Shawshank Redemption. Earlier this year he deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his haunting performance as a grown-up victim of child abuse in Mystic River. </p> <p>He's still artistic director of the Actors Gang, and though he's been accused of autocratic management, it is from this LA-based theatre group that he recruited most of the US cast for Embedded.</p> <p>'Once a year,' he tells me, 'I do a training thing with all the new actors. In order to do the workshop you have to be an intern and help out in the theatre, and in return they get free training. I come in and do intensive 10-hour days for six days straight.' He looks tired, heavy lidded, and talks in a half-formed sentences punctuated by hippyisms. 'I don't think I've ever been so busy in my life,' he explains. 'It's really cool.' He runs me through his schedule for the next month, which includes acting, editing, visits to London (to prepare but not perform in Embedded) and Venice, and finally a brief tour supporting Pearl Jam with his weekend band Gob Roberts as part of an effort to register voters for the presidential election in November.</p> <p>'We started this band last summer and played some at the Sundance film festival in the winter,' he says and flashes one of his semi-embarrassed smiles. 'We do mostly Bob Roberts songs electrified and amplified. It's just pure unadulterated fun.'</p> <p>But before the fun, there's Embedded, which he says he was inspired to write following his experience in London filming Michael Winterbottom's Code 46 during the build-up to the war in Iraq. 'I was getting the impression that there was a debate, because I was reading London papers. I was getting balance. Even in the Times - isn't that owned by Murdoch - if they presented the WMD side, they presented the other side too: journalism, what we have come to mourn the loss of in America.'</p> <p>He says that the American media coverage was all about 'fear-mongering, propaganda, demonising', and compares its uniformity to Soviet news reporting. He then explains that while, in the wake of 9/11, he could not bring himself to protest against the war in Afghanistan, he did not agree with the strategy of 'indiscriminate bombing'. If he had been president, he 'would have trained special ops to go do the job right' and not interfered with Afghanistan sovereignty. 'The democratic movement in any country has got to happen on its own. It's never going to happen through bombs and airplanes. Never going to happen that way.'</p> <p>Various aspects of this speech strike me as naive or fantastic (not least the magical powers of special ops), but for the sake of historical accuracy I merely point out that there is a historical precedent for bombs and airplanes bringing democracy.</p> <p>'How? When?' He sits up, suddenly rattled.</p> <p>I mention Germany and Japan in the Second World War.</p> <p>'It seems to be that we always come back to that. I don't know it didn't happen without the determination of the people involved.'</p> <p>I point out that it didn't happen in East Germany, and he replies: 'I'd have to go into the history and the specifics of that. It came at the end of the gun but with the influx of a huge amount of money: the Marshall Plan. In Iraq, the money is going into war-mongering. It has nothing to do with democracy. It's about destabilisation. That's what Kosovo was about. It's the same thing any time there's a threat to US national security.' This is not the typical conversation one has with American film actors, and I feel a professional obligation to steer it back to more familiar territory such as marital infidelity and substance abuse (neither of which appear to loom large in the Robbins biography) but I recall something he had said in an interview some years back. 'The only responsibility I have to anyone is to make sure that when I talk about something, I know what I'm talking about, that I've done the research. I take that responsibility very seriously. I read a lot.'</p> <p>So I ask how Kosovo was a threat to US security.</p> <p>'Ahm...' he hesitates. 'I believe... I'm not the right person to talk about this... but that region of the world, this is the way I've heard it put... Can I go get a cigarette?' He disappears and, as if having remembered his Noam Chomsky, returns a minute later with a ready-fit anti-imperialist answer. 'Where it's all flawed is this hegemonic belief that if you bring business to a country it will help them.'</p> <p>Leaving aside what he had said a moment earlier about the Marshall Plan, I say that when I visited Kosovo it was less about bringing business than preventing communal bloodshed.</p> <p>'I'm ignorant on this subject,' he admits, without bluster. 'I'd have to read up on it.' He returns to Iraq, a subject on which he has done a fair amount of reading. Contradicting himself once again, he repeats the line that the Iraq war was a neoconservative plot hatched in 1989 by Bush advisers who believed 'they could spread democracy. They thought they were altruistic' - so not about destabilisation after all - 'They were wrong.'</p> <p>Robbins is not a politician and it is therefore a little unfair to parse his words, teasing out the contradictions and inconsistencies. But his muddled thinking, in which the only continuum is that American foreign policy is always bad, informs his writing as a dramatist. He shows me a scene that he's editing from Embedded that is both pretentious and simple-minded - not a happy combination - and is reminiscent of the worst shouty agitprop. </p> <p>With admirable foresight, he is not planning on good reviews in London. 'It would be nice to get embraced by a critical community, but we're not expecting it. It was word of mouth in New York. We're doing a populist theatre.'</p> <p>In the scene I see, a 'cabal' of neocons, including caricatures of Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, sit around in commedia masks detailing their conspiracy to run the world. Robbins talks eloquently about the use of masks, something he picked up from the Theatre du Soleil. 'The tendency when expressing emotion is to be too frantic,' he says. 'So we're trying to get people to settle and trust their emotions. What's important is what comes through the eyes.'</p> <p>The problem is that it's hard to imagine a more frantic style of acting than that on display in Embedded. The actors deliver their lines with the exuberance of people taking part in a celebration of political solidarity rather than a satirical drama. I suggest to Robbins that such theatre has to contend with the charge of 'preaching to the converted', and indeed I can't imagine many visitors to the Riverside Studios looking to have their prejudices challenged.</p> <p>'That's one of the lines that's always in reviews,' he says a little wearily. 'And \"sophomoric\" and \"didactic\". It's a non-criticism. First of all, it's not true. My answer is: who's the choir? Who's the converted? An awful lot of liberals supported that war. Even if there was a choir it was way out of tune. They were not singing together. So even if it were true, it's OK.'</p> <p>Since Robbins first started protesting against the war, American politics, and its reporting in the media, has undergone the beginnings of a sea change. It's no longer seen as un-American to question aspects of the US-led occupation in Iraq. I wonder if Robbins had detected a more loquacious mood among fellow actors in Hollywood. 'I don't know,' he says a little tersely. 'I don't live here. I don't know this world. I don't go to the parties. I can't speak for them.'</p> <p>This sounds like a mechanical answer, designed to confirm his position as the celebrity anti-celebrity, the Hollywood player who refuses to play the game. I press him further. 'Look,' he says, 'you can count on one hand the actors in Hollywood who came out against the war. The biggest joke is when people say you do it for attention or your career.'</p> <p>Doubtless it's not pleasant reading unkind things about yourself in the newspapers or hearing snide jokes on TV, but you sense that Robbins savours his position as the film industry's most outspoken voice. </p> <p>'I remember thinking,' he goes on, 'when I went to that anti-war rally: OK, the shit's going to fly. But the shit's going to fly inwards if you don't do it. Because you were afraid of what? Being less rich? After the Hall of Fame thing, I was so thankful I lived in New York because you have to walk around. And people came up to me and said \"Thank you\". Two people said negative things - they were both white men and both in SUVs, and both shouted out the window and drove away. The second time I was able to get one word out and that was: \"Enlist.\" </p> <p>'Because my essential problem with that war, beyond the politics, is that we're getting the poor people to fight the war, and they were put there by people who got out of military service.'</p> <p>When he can resist the lure of cheap conspiracy theories - a test that he failed in what I saw of Embedded - Robbins can talk with impressive passion. Here you see the dramatist as orator. You either agree with him or not. However, it's when the activist shapes the actor that Robbins should beware. That's a matter of aesthetics, and there doesn't seem much debate that the beautifully subtle acting of Mystic River wins out every time over the student histrionics of Embedded.</p> <p>The best-read politico in Hollywood may, as compliments go, rank alongside the tallest pygmy, but there's much to be said for an actor who reads the world's press. And as long as his platform is not the stage, Robbins should not be ridiculed for expressing his views. Even if you don't agree with them.</p> <p>He tells me that at the Oscars a number of actors came up and whispered to him: '\"Thanks for speaking out.\" They whispered. Why?' He shakes his head and then smiles, a big sparkling dimpled grin that somehow says more about Robbins than any of his speeches could ever begin to articulate.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Embedded will be at Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, London W6 (020 8237 1111) from 31 August to 23 October</p>",
  "More republican prisoners are being held in jails in the Irish Republic than in their traditional battleground of Northern Ireland. <p>Ten years ago this weekend, when the world waited for the Provisionals' ceasefire, there were several hundred IRA and INLA inmates locked up in the Maze prison outside Belfast. But in a reversal of fortunes for republicanism, the number of dissidents held in southern jails now exceeds those imprisoned in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Former IRA prisoners described the new scenario as evidence of the futility of continuing the 'armed struggle'. </p> <p>Figures obtained by The Observer show that there are 67 prisoners belonging to four different republican factions being held in Portlaoise top security jail and Castlerea open prison in the south. </p> <p>The latest statistics from the Northern Ireland Prison Service reveal there are only 28 republican prisoners, all but two from the Real or Continuity IRAs. Republicans are outnumbered in northern prisons, with 44 loyalist inmates held there. </p> <p>At Portlaoise there are 10 inmates aligned to the Continuity IRA, the faction closely linked to Republican Sinn Fein. A further 18 are under the command of Liam Campbell, a Real IRA commander and one of only two men sentenced in connection with the 1998 Omagh bomb massacre. Another 11 prisoners at Portlaoise are loyal to Michael McKevitt, founder of the Real IRA, who split from the Provisionals in November 1997. McKevitt and Campbell parted company after the former offered a ceasefire deal to the Irish state during his trial over a year ago. Campbell's faction regarded McKevitt's offer as a sell-out of republican principles and regard themselves as the true representatives of the Real IRA in the jail. A further seven prisoners are held on the terrorist wings of the jail but non-aligned to any faction. </p> <p>In Castlerea open prison there are 11 prisoners connected to the Provisional IRA, including the four killers of Garda Jerry McCabe and five members of the Provos' Dublin Brigade convicted of armed robberies. Two INLA members, including Dessie 'The Border Fox' O'Hare, are also held at Castlerea. </p> <p>Anthony McIntyre was serving a life sentence in the Maze prison 10 years ago when the IRA leadership was preparing for its historic ceasefire. Now a writer, co-founder of the republican website The Blanket and a critic of the Sinn Fein leadership, McIntyre compared those carrying on the 'armed struggle' to Japanese soldiers still waging conflict 30 years after the end of the Second World War. 'They are like those Japanese soldiers holed up in the Philippines 30 years later, still fighting the war despite the fact that Japan has moved on.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Zig Zag Way</strong><br>by Anita Desai<br>Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a312.99, pp179</p> <p>Salman Rushdie once described Anita Desai's subject as solitude. Her characters tend to be outsiders, torn between privacy and the powerful family and social bonds that both stifle and unite them. No doubt her dual heritage (she is half-Bengali, half-German and her first language was German) gives Desai an 'outsider' status.</p> <p>In her work, characters often adopt escapist ways to cope with the banalities of everyday life. In The Zigzag Way, her 14th novel, Eric is a self-absorbed North American academic, bored by his studies, unable to commit to the fantasy of writing his novel. He may have reached premature domestic bliss with his girlfriend, Em ('They seemed already to have reached a stage that many couples require 30 years to achieve'), but he is beginning to stifle her with his possessiveness. Will the relationship last?</p> <p>When Em is offered a sabbatical in Mexico, it seems a fresh start. Eric decides to accompany her, somewhat to her concern. But Mexico is where Eric's journey begins. He travels high up in the Sierra Madre to undertake a quest to find out more about his grandfather, a Cornish miner who, as a young man, emigrated to Mexico to work the mines in the days just before Pancho Villa and revolution came to Mexico.</p> <p>Desai has said that she has no desire to classify herself as an Indian writer, and her novels have an undeniably European quality. But it is telling that the grand canvas against which she sets The Zigzag Way is Mexico, where she has a retreat ('It's the closest I can get to India when I'm in America'). The heat, the strangeness and the colour of the country seduce Eric. Through his journey, and the people he meets, Desai offers a complex, dreamlike history of 20th-century Mexico, making clear the exploitation of the Mexican Indians by some of their greatest 'supporters'.</p> <p>The novel is structured as three interwoven narratives: Eric's modernday story; the life of Dona Vera, the autocratic 'Queen of the Sierra', who has a dubious European past of her own; and the story of Eric's grandmother, a young Cornish girl who journeyed to join her fiance in Mexico only to die while giving birth.</p> <p>It is only on the feast Day of the Dead, when the locals celebrate their lost loved ones, that the various strands of the novel come together and Eric faces up to his past.</p> <p>Refreshingly, instead of saddling Eric with a creaky new romance, Desai makes the true revelation in his life more internal.</p> <p>Like Desai's earlier novels, The Zigzag Way tackles stereotypical Western views of Indians, anti-semitism, the tensions of family life and the alienation of middle-class women. But, at times, character loses out to detailed panoramic descriptions of Mexico and it is easy for readers' attention to flag. Only in the final section about Eric's grandmother, a proper, flesh-and-blood woman, does the novel stop being a poetic travelogue and really start to live.</p> <p>At her best, Desai approaches the Mexican landscape like a master cinematographer (her earlier novel, In Custody, was filmed by Merchant Ivory) and one senses The Zigzag Way might work best as a film.</p>",
  "<p>When he was murdered in Bolivia in October 1967 by the local army in association with the CIA, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara immediately took his place alongside Bolivar, Pancho Villa and other heroic Latin American revolutionaries. Comparable in popular appeal to Jack Kennedy, he immediately became for young people what TE Lawrence and Leon Trotsky had been for their parents, the contemporary model of the intellectual as man of action. </p> <p>Like Lawrence he was an irregular soldier who took up the cause of others. Like Trotsky he was a communist intellectual and second in command of a revolution that confounded political theory. Like both of them he was physically unprepossessing, but made up for this in charisma, and like them too, he died a violent death. </p> <p>All of them have been the subjects of movies, but only David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is a work of consequence, and the 1969 Hollywood picture Che! (co-scripted, like Lawrence, by Michael Wilson and starring an embarrassed Omar Sharif) is disastrous. Che also figured on stage narrating the grotesque Evita, but in Alan Parker's film version, while still called Che, he no longer wears the trademark beard and beret and is more like the Brechtian 'Man of the People' in A Man for All Seasons. </p> <p>The tough, ruthless, ideologically driven Guevara, though still an icon of sorts through the ubiquity of the Alberto Korda photograph, is no longer the hero he once was. He's gone the way of Chairman Mao and his Little Red Book, to be replaced by the more benign figure of Nelson Mandela as the acceptable face of revolutionary politics. In fact, the Che that is offered us in Walter Salles's The Motorcycle Diaries is a diffident charmer, and the film is set in 1952, two years before he completed his medical studies, left his native Argentina for good, saw the CIA overthrow a democratic government in Guatemala, crossed into Mexico a confirmed revolutionary and met Fidel Castro. </p> <p>The Motorcycle Diaries is an account of a journey of social exploration and self-discovery undertaken by two men and based on books they wrote. The first is the 23-year-old Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) before he was nicknamed 'Che', the much loved son of a well-heeled middle-class family of Irish and Spanish descent living in Buenos Aires. The second is a family friend, the 29-year-old biochemist Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna). They set out on a decrepit 1939 Norton motorbike to travel 8,000 kilometres (nearly 5,000 miles) in five months and see the vast continent on which they live. The trek will take them across the Andes into Chile, through the Atacama Desert to Peru and, after a sojourn at a leper colony on the Amazon, they'll end up in Venezuela. They called their vehicle 'La Poderosa' ('The Mighty One') but it soon lets them down. Anticipating numerous spills to come, they nearly crash into a bus within sight of Guevara's waving family. </p> <p>In some ways the movie resembles Easy Rider, a picture made when Che's posthumous reputation was at its height, but it's altogether more cheerful, optimistic, benevolent, and Ernesto and Alberto are far more likeable and idealistic than the fashionable heroes of Dennis Hopper's movie. They're a complementary pair. The thin, asthmatic Ernesto is naive, withdrawn, compulsively honest and can't tell a tango from a mambo. The robust, moustached Alberto is a silver-tongued, outgoing womaniser, who can charm the birds off the trees and into bed. They are united by a belief in progress and what science and medicine can do for their region. What they discover as they pass through the beautiful, challenging landscape are the near-intractable problems of a continent of such physical and social extremes - mountains and endless flat plains; deserts and lush jungle; the complacent rich and the downtrodden poor; the great civilisation of the Incas that the Spanish conquistadors destroyed and the new cities with their endless slums. The magnificence of Machu Picchu is contrasted with the anonymous sprawl of Lima. </p> <p>The first stop is the grand hacienda in Miramar, south of Buenos Aires, where Guevara's fianc\u00e9e lives in confident splendour. It's a beautifully observed episode of social privilege. Subsequently, with vividness and wit, the film presents the pair's own experience of being indigent and marginal. </p> <p>The film tends to idealise the poor and suggest they have a monopoly on kindness and decency. But one of the pair's most striking encounters is with the dedicated Dr Pescu, a man of probity and a leading authority on leprosy. He takes them into his house and arranges for them to take a five-day boat trip to a leper colony on the Peruvian Amazon. But before they leave he asks them to read the novel he's been working on for years, and Guevara's response to a request for his opinion on it is a moment of great delicacy. </p> <p>This river journey to the heart of the continent takes on a powerful significance, and their working visit to the colony proves vital to both of them. Alfredo decides to retrain as a medical doctor and help the poor. Guevara's development is artfully revealed through a series of expressive gestures. He gives a precious reserve of money to a penniless, unemployed, communist couple they meet in the desert. He leaves some of his own essential medicine with a dying old woman. He throws a stone in anger at a truck belonging to the Anaconda Copper Company, the American firm exploiting Chilean miners. At the leper colony he is shocked that the hospital is on one side of the Amazon and the patients are kept on the other. To mark his 24th birthday he swims the river, braving the piranhas to symbolically unite the two parts, just after he has proposed a toast 'to Peru and to a United America'. </p> <p>The film draws together several countries in making a similar affirmation. The leading actors are Mexican and Argentine. Salles, whose best movie this is, is Brazilian. The excellent photography is the work of a Frenchman, Eric Gautier, and the producer is Robert Redford. Their film would, I think, still command our attention even if we didn't know what lies in store for its principal character, and it doesn't indulge in phoney hindsight. </p> <p>There's a clever variation on the conventional final montage in black and white of people they met on the journey. Instead of an expected succession of still photographs there is a faint suggestion of movement in these carefully posed pictures to tell us that these everyday Latin American folk are not frozen in time but vibrantly alive.</p>"
