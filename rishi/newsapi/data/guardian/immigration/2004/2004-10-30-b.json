  "<p>'A quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing,' said Neville Chamberlain, yet Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, is only two hours from London by air and now crawling with British tourists. </p> <p>When I went there for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund conference in September 2000 the place was under siege from the anti-globalisation movement. Your correspondent was struck by a defenestrated egg - or, rather, the egg scored a direct hit on the letters 'IMF' on a document I was carrying. I was only able to get past the protesters on the last day by climbing a wall and scrambling across wasteland to a housing estate. War correspondents are used to that kind of thing, but for us it was quite an adventure. </p> <p>It was some time after that Gordon Brown, having laughed heartily at the slogan 'World movement against globalisation' decided he might as well enlist the help of the protest movement in fighting for greater debt relief for impoverished African countries. </p> <p>The conference I attended in Prague earlier this month was an altogether smaller and quieter affair. Under the auspices of the British Council, the Foreign Policy Centre and the government of the Czech Republic, the Prague Castle Conference addressed the question 'Can Europe sharpen its competitive edge?' It was a review at almost the halfway stage of the so-called Lisbon agenda, under which the members of the European Union, then not yet swollen to 25, set themselves in 2000 the ambitious task of overtaking the US economy by 2010. </p> <p>This coming week will see the publication of the Kok report (from a committee chaired by Wim Kok, former Dutch Prime Minister) on what has gone wrong and what should be done. Kok was quoted last week as saying: 'Progress to date has been inadequate largely owing to lack of commitment and political will.' </p> <p>This, of course, is in sharp contrast to the extraordinary commitment and political will which drove Jean Monnet and others to form the European Coal and Steel Community and the Common Market in the first place. The ECSC was an attempt to unite Germany and France in the natural resources they previously fought over. The habit has spread. These days, one notes, EDF Energy, a subsidiary of Electricit\u00e9 de France, distributes electricity to a quarter of the UK's population. </p> <p>But let us return to that elusive European 'competitive edge'. Now many, if not most, economists question the concept of the competitiveness of a country, let alone a union of states. They prefer to think of companies or corporations in competition with one another. Also, economists tend to emphasise that trade is a two- (or multi-) way business, and just because most of the toys in your house come from China it does not mean that Europe has lost out in some competitive game. </p> <p>In a paper to the Prague conference, the economist John Kay noted: 'Living standards are a product of competitiveness, but they are not a measure of competitiveness, which is the efficiency and effectiveness with which inputs into production are used.' </p> <p>One important influence on price competitiveness is the exchange rate. After the fall of the Berlin Wall a senior World Bank economist was asked which economy he would prefer, the former Eastern Germany (which had been aligned with West Germany at a very uncompetitive exchange rate) or what was then Czechoslovakia, with its flexible exchange rate. The unhesitating reply was 'East Germany, because of all that West German money'. I wonder whether that economist's reply would be the same today. </p> <p>There is a sense of disillusionment among some in the Czech Republic about the niggardly atti tude of the 15 members they have joined towards the size of the Brussels budget and hence towards the kind of regional help available in the past to Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. Indeed there seems to be an affinity between the Czech Republic and Ireland (not least in the number of Irish pubs there), with envious eyes cast towards past Irish subsidies (one recalls that the letters EMS, for European Monetary System, were known in Dublin in 1979 as standing for Easy Money Soon). </p> <p>Regional help proved a necessary but not sufficient condition for the remarkable economic progress of Ireland and others, whereas it has not so far worked miracles in Eastern Germany. </p> <p>One must never forget that the original European Economic Com munity saw a deal under which Germany, atoning for you know what, undertook massive subsidisation of French agriculture, giving us the Common Agricultural Policy, which still accounts for half the Brussels budget. </p> <p>But back to the Prague conference. If it is any consolation, one Czech contributor listed the ability to read and write English as one of the three most important factors assisting international competitiveness. There was also a reassuring feeling among participants that Scandinavia, with its good marks for high spending on social services, fared outstandingly well in the World Economic Forum's league tables. </p> <p>An interesting theme was the impression of many speakers that the entire Lisbon agenda for improving Europe's economic performance was based on the false premise that the EU was necessarily inferior to the US. For all the talk of the need for 'structural reform' Europe does not compare too badly with the US on measures of productivity per hour. </p> <p>Statistics bear out what the person in the Clapham video shop suspects: that superior US growth is largely accounted for by faster accretions to the labour force in recent decades (immigration), longer hours worked (much shorter holidays) and macro economic policies that have been far more expansionary than in the US. </p> <p>As with most things in the EU, the Lisbon agenda was 'politically driven'. Only a group of politicians could have put their names to the aim 'to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion'. </p> <p>This is not to say the tone of the conference was complacent. There was real concern about the degree to which the US is ahead of the EU in higher education, numbers of Nobel prize winners and so on. There is as much concern today about a 'brain drain' to the US as there was in the Fifties. But such is the attraction of the European way of life to Americans that their home-grown brains delight in spending time in sclerotic, structurally unreformed Old Europe. </p> <p>One such is Philip Bobbitt, of the University of Texas and author of The Shield of Achilles , who livened up the Prague debate by claiming, not to universal agreement, that we haven't seen anything yet when it comes to the so-called 'war on terror'. </p> <p>I spent some time pondering the connection between European competitiveness and the prominence at the conference of such a distinguished expert on terror. Does Europe need to spend more on defence to protect its competitive position because massive US spending on defence will boost its competitiveness as it did during the Cold War? Or will massive defence spending act as a drag on US competitiveness? </p> <p>The more immediate concern for Europe may be that, whoever wins the presidential election, all that US expenditure on fighting 'terror' will, via those ballooning deficits, drive the dollar down a lot further, and the euro a lot further up, thereby damaging - well, European competitiveness...</p>",
  "<p>In just a little over five months we will likely be at the start of the next general election. My bet is on 5 May 2005, which would be called in the first or second week of April next year. </p> <p>The public is increasingly worried about the state of Britain's economy. Nearly four people in 10 (38 per cent) now say they think that the British economy will get worse, more than three times the 12 per cent who think it will get better. The Mori Economic Optimism Index is those who think the economy will improve, less those who think it will get worse, a net -26. Last month the index was -22 (14 per cent optimistic, 36 per cent pessimistic). </p> <p>There is no doubt that the management of the economy will play an important role in determining the majority, if not the outcome, of the general election. That's not to say it is top of people's minds, because most think the Chancellor has it under control. </p> <p>Since the 2001 general election, there has not been a single month in which public opinion has been more optimistic than pessimistic about the general economic future of the country. In April 2001, the month before the general election, only one person in six thought the economy would improve and four in 10 thought it would get worse, for a net -22, yet Labour was still returned with a landslide. </p> <p>Although only one in seven people are currently optimistic about the economy next year, when asked if they think in the longer term that this government's economic policies will improve the state of Britain's economy, the optimists jump to 39 per cent of people in the latest Mori Delivery Index, while 47 per cent are negative. But among those likely to vote, the figures are 45 /45. </p> <p>One person in four, 24 per cent, says that the management of the economy is one of the two or three issues that will be most important in determining their vote, putting it in seventh place behind the NHS, education, law and order, pensions, asylum seekers/immigration and tax. Among those who think the economy important, Labour's policies are preferred by 33 per cent, while the Tories score 30, and the Liberal Democrats 9, a +3 for the Labour government. But at the 2001 general election, Labour led the Conservatives by 34 points on the management of the economy. </p> <p>Much comment recently has focused on Labour's weakness with prospective women voters, which was brought out in the Fawcett Society report. Some of this can be attributed to the fact that there are more elderly women than men. This has two consequences: first, women are more likely to vote Conservative than men, and older women are more likely to vote Tory than their younger sisters. </p> <p>We find that women are significantly less optimistic than men that the economy will improve over the next year. While 17 per cent of men are optimistic, the figure for women is just one in 10. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,031 adults aged 18+ at 186 sampling points across Great Britain, in-home on 21-27th October 2004.

  "<p>No two rugby institutions could be more joined at the hip than the Welsh Rugby Union and the Cardiff Blues. To the North Stand of the Millennium Stadium is bolted the main stand of the Arms Park, home of the Blues. No two rugby institutions share a more common problem. Wales and the Blues are sweet on the eye, full of daring; both are liable to be screwed up front. On Friday night Stade Fran\u00e7ais of one capital city made a mess of the line-out and scrum of another. </p> <p>The result was never in doubt. The Blues have now lost twice in Pool 6 and the pressure will only intensify on David Young to step down as the coach of the side to which he returned as a player shortly after the game went professional in 1995. </p> <p>Those were the heady days of recapturing Welsh souls lost to rugby league. Young came back south to Cardiff, just like Jonathan Davies. Alan Bateman, Paul Moriarty and Rowland Phillips returned to other Welsh clubs. The lost generation was reclasped to the Welsh bosom. </p> <p>It was also a time of fractiousness. The WRU had a notion - 'vision' might be overdoing it - of what professionalism might mean, while Cardiff had theirs. In those days, Cardiff was just a rugby club, although as they were ever keen to remind everyone they were hardly like any other. Modesty has never been Cardiff's bag. </p> <p>That's not to say they were the bad guys in the spat of that hour. It was a delicious tiff between the nearest of neighbours. No two rugby institutions could have been closer and yet further apart. </p> <p>On one side stood Cardiff, prompted then as now by the man who underwrites the debts, Peter Thomas, from a millionaire family of pie-makers. On the other stood Glanmor Griffiths, chairman of the WRU. It was essentially about a 10-year loyalty agreement that the governing body were insisting that every club sign. Cardiff said: 'Ten years? You don't even know what you'll be doing in 10 days.' </p> <p>Cardiff - hauling a slightly more reluctant and certainly less underwritten Swansea with them - left the Welsh fold and sought sanctuary as rebels in England, where the clubs' owners were similarly, if less melodramatically, at odds with the RFU. </p> <p>It was all complicated by the fact that behind Griffiths stood Vernon Pugh, the former chairman of the WRU, who had gone on to be leader of the global game with the International Rugby Board. Pugh was a hard-liner when it came to facing down any challenge to authority. He had left Griffiths behind to do his will. </p> <p>But Glanmor was also trying to build the Millennium Stadium in time for Vernon's World Cup of 1999. And to do that he needed the goodwill of the neighbours. Access, and all that, to the site next door. A lot of concrete had to pass through the Arms Park. </p> <p>It was truly a wonderful time. And only six years ago. The upshot was that Cardiff stayed out of the Welsh system for a year. (And the European. They joined the English boycott of 1998/99). They then returned to the fold. Glanmor built his stadium and was later eased out of office by David Moffet, an ice-man with no interest in Welsh squabbles. </p> <p>Everything should have been dandy. But here Cardiff are in 2004, regionalised as the Blues. The depressed franchise of the four. One of the escape routes in the rebel year was an offer by the English clubs to create an Anglo-Welsh League with places for five Welsh clubs. Only five? How the WRU scoffed at the impertinence. Now, Wales run just four regions in a Celtic League that is struggling to match any aspect of domestic rugby in England or France. </p> <p>And the Blues exemplify the struggle. Peter Thomas may have underwritten Cardiff's debts, but no money has been invested. Worse, the playing budget was cut. Expensive players, like Robert Howley and Jonathan Humphreys, were deemed over the hill, only for them to glow in their twilight years at Wasps and Bath. </p> <p>There is certainly trouble at coaching level. Young can cite lack of investment and injuries to the Robinson brothers, Nicky and Jamie, but that does not explain how other good, fit players at the Blues are playing badly. Martyn Williams is a consummate footballer but was one of five defenders swatted aside by 21-year old Julien Arias as the winger ran more than half the length of the field for a killer try on Friday night. </p> <p>Gethin Jenkins is a gifted prop, potentially a great loose-head and versatile enough to volunteer for the tight-head. He was shoved around by Stade. Robert Sidoli, towering for Wales in the second row against the All Blacks a couple of seasons ago, looks totally stripped of confidence. </p> <p>Next week, the stage shifts from the Arms Park to the Millennium Stadium. Wales against South Africa. Perhaps we had better be braced for sure confirmation that, however much the neighbours shout at each other over the fence, what befalls the one will affect the other.</p>",
  "<b>Dear Andrew</b> <br> I hope that \"Back to church Sunday\" goes well, though I won't be joining the churchgoers. I know that there are people who find support and comfort in religion, but I don't, and I doubt whether society as a whole has much need of religion either. <p>There are countless examples of religious societies that are hostile to change and to science, misogynistic and intolerant of difference - to the point of violence. And even in constitutionally secular states like the USA, fundamentalist Christians seem to have a worrying amount of influence over government policy at home and abroad.</p> <p>British society, on the other hand, is fairly irreligious, and I'm glad of that. I think it helps to make our culture more tolerant and open, even though we are not yet a secular state and vestiges of religious privilege and influence remain. A pluralist society like ours shouldn't favour any one religion - or religion over atheism or humanism.</p> <p>Of course, individuals and societies need hopes and values to live by, but for many of us these will not be religious, and there is no going back to the piety and conformity of the past (if indeed they ever really existed). Modern societies need to recognise that.<br> <b>Best wishes, Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> I'm weary this evening, my bones are aching. I've been doing jury service. Gazing fixedly into a world, it seems, quite without faith, or hope, or any sense of the sacred at all.</p> <p>Does society need religion? No, indeed. We moderns, in our wisdom, have found other ways of holding things together: consumerism, sport, celebrity gossip, party politics. And yes, I thank God that we no longer think we depend upon religion for social cement.</p> <p>Because that means that now, as never before, religion is set free to do its real job - of vindicating truthfulness. We jurors swore an oath to be conscientiously fair. Most of us did so on the New Testament. This, I think, represents what true religion is all about: a commitment to just such conscientiousness about truth, in life generally. Of course, I'm not for one moment suggesting that purely secular \"affirmations\" are any less sincere. Only, what I value is the extra poetic oomph that religion potentially gives, in this regard.</p> <p>Religious fundamentalists, secular fundamentalists: both mostly talk about the same \"God\", for and against. And both no doubt offer comfort, the comfort of a rigid self-certainty. But true religion, as I understand it, has a rather different God in mind. A God who, on the contrary, only takes away such comfort. Makes life more difficult. Confronts us with truthfulness, precisely, as an infinite demand.<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>Dear Andrew</b><br> Jury service must be sorely trying, but perhaps your faith in humanity will be restored when you and your fellow jurors engage in conscientiously seeking truth, fairness, and justice - as most juries do, I believe. Life after religion is not all crime, sex, football and shopping, as religious pessimists often seem to think. Most of us know that a good life depends on various permutations of friends, family, meaningful activity, nature, art, poetry, music ... and trying to leave the world a bit better than one found it. Even the party politics you despise, though it can be trivial and dirty business, is often motivated by a desire to improve society.</p> <p>I'm probably just as interested in and committed to truth as you are, though I find it outside a religious framework. I am by no means as certain about everything as you imply, but I don't find it difficult to live with a few \"don't knows\" in my life. I don't know how life on Earth started (and neither does anyone else at the moment), and I don't know for sure what will happen to me when I die (and probably never will), but I don't find the religious answers at all convincing or helpful, even the more liberal ones that talk in terms of metaphor and religion being a human construct.</p> <p>So I just try to live life as well as I can without supernatural support. I wouldn't say that life as a thoughtful humanist is particularly easy - the obligation to think things through for oneself can be irksome, and any commitment to moral values, whatever they are founded on, can easily produce a state of impotent fury and misery, faced with the suffering and horrors we see every day in the news. I just have to keep telling myself that the world is not full of terrorists who kill children and saw off hostages' heads, and that ordinary goodness and moderation rarely make it into the media.<br> <b>Best wishes, Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> Thanks for the concern. But let me assure you, my faith in humanity has never been in doubt! It's just that, as a Christian priest, I identify it with faith in God incarnate. </p> <p>And then, if I may say so, I do feel slightly patronised by your evident assumption that the one and only possible source of such faith is a craving for - as you put it - \"supernatural support\". I'm really just asking you to acknowledge the possibility, at least, that there might be other forms of religiousness. Ones that are, on the contrary, all about knocking away the false \"supports\" of conventional prejudice.</p> <p>Of course, that you're a public spokesperson for Humanism immediately tells me you're a serious lover of Truth. And if only all serious lovers of Truth could be allies! But I know you won't allow it. You Humanists have converted your lack of feel for religion into such a dogma, such a distraction.</p> <p>I don't at all \"despise\" party politics, by the way. God forbid! I have a real admiration for party politicians' thick-skinnedness. What troubles me, though, is when people deal with religion as if it were something like party politics, a matter for propaganda. Let's argue, certainly. But propaganda's something else. I'm personally just as allergic to propaganda for religion as I am to propaganda against it. In a culture saturated with propaganda, I go to church looking for the very purest opposite. (And just occasionally do find it.)<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>Dear Andrew</b><br> Whenever I say negative things about religion I'm told off for being dogmatic, and whenever I say something even the slightest bit nice, I'm told I'm being patronising - so apologies in advance for whatever it is I'm being today.</p> <p>I didn't mean to imply that the only reason for believing is a craving for supernatural support, but it is surely one of the reasons - and one of the things that will get people into churches on Sunday. And I know that religiousness takes many forms - it is really only the more dogmatic, authoritarian and power-hungry ones that I fear. Like most humanists, I am happy to set aside differences of belief and motivation and work with anyone for a good cause (and some of my best friends are religious!).</p> <p>But also, like most humanists, I don't expect any particular privileges for my world view or any social status or power to come with it. In that I think we differ from some religions (not all, of course). Religious leaders still seem to expect the rest of us to defer to their opinions, and sometimes even (for example, the two archbishops on the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill) claim to speak for us, or to want to educate us. That's why humanists like me would prefer religion to be a private matter, and the search for truth and a good society to be carried out on a level playing field.</p> <p>When I want to escape life's stresses and \"propaganda\" I listen to music or go for a walk. This Sunday, weather permitting, I'll be halfway up a mountain - church does it for you, nature does it for me.<br> <b>Best wishes, Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> Yes, but there you go again!</p> <p>I don't go to church to \"escape life's stresses and propaganda\", as you put it. You're still automatically assuming all we religious folk are essentially escapists. But I don't want to escape the prevailing propaganda-culture - I want to resist it.</p> <p>The disease, the cult of Mammon, thrives on the ever-increasing atomistic individualism of our society. Resistance requires effective structures of solidarity, imaginatively rich community, serious traditions of enlightened authority. All the things that church life, for instance, is meant to provide. Going for long walks (as I also do) simply isn't enough.</p> <p>I don't want the churches to have unfair privileges any more than you do. I just want to help keep alive a certain quite seriously endangered intensity of resistant hope.<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>Dear Andrew</b><br> I too want to resist a lot of what I see around me - war, complacency, inequality, the vilification of asylum seekers - though I want to celebrate some (perhaps endangered) things as well. A recent evening at London's Conway Hall celebrated 75 years of free speech. But what really engaged the speakers - Polly Toynbee, Richard Dawkins, Barbara Smoker and Martin Rowson - and the audience were the threats to that freedom in the proposals for a new law against incitement to religious hatred. Any such law would have to be very carefully framed - individuals may need protection against hatred, but we must remain free to criticise religious beliefs. Why, when all other ideas are up for criticism, evaluation, revision, change, should religious ones be different and given special protection? It seems to people like me yet another example of religion intruding into the public domain, claiming more than its due and trying to shut down dissent.</p> <p>I read a news story about a woman in Italy killed by a falling crucifix - things like that always make me wonder what kind of god could let that happen. It's conceivable that in a year or two I won't be allowed to wonder things like that in public because it might offend someone or incite someone else to religious hatred (a new thought crime, \"cruciphobia\" maybe).</p> <p>I'm pretty sure that individuals will continue to need religion, that some religious individuals will continue to do good in the world, and that religious institutions will continue to provide a sense of community and hope for those who can belong to them. That's where religion should remain, at the individual and local level, far from the societal or political sphere where it often contrives to do more harm than good.<br> <b>Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> Plainly the proposed new law does need careful framing. Nor do we Christians need it. I don't think we need blasphemy to be outlawed either.</p> <p>But there surely are good arguments for outlawing the crude whipping up of mere hatred against minorities. As a matter of general principle, I think it makes perfect sense to protect not only racial but also multi-racial groups, such as the Muslim community in this country. Or Humanists!</p> <p>I've had rather an encouraging experience of the actual workings of British law this week. And I think it would be good to have the distinction between angry but thoughtful critique, on the one hand, and mere self-indulgent hatred, on the other hand, painstakingly tested, explored and negotiated in the courts.</p> <p>Indeed, it seems to me that the cause of Truth positively demands some such process. Doesn't it?<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Marilyn Mason is the education officer for the British Humanist Association; Andrew Shanks is the canon theologian at Manchester Cathedral</p>",

  "<p>It looks so serene. So peaceful. So harmless. Across a mill pond sea, under a clear blue sky, I can make out an oil tanker gliding effortlessly past a large buoy and two tooth-shaped icebergs. After a moment's reverie, I steer my kayak into a gentle slalom through chunks of ice, distant fragments of the 10 million tons that calve off Alaska's Columbia glacier every day. </p> <p>If only it had been so easy 15 years ago. In a bid to avoid bergs from the same prolific source, the Exxon Valdez and its cargo of 53 million gallons of oil, turned out of the shipping lane, made a catastrophic navigational error and ran aground on Bligh Reef, the hazard marked by the buoy. Six sharp jolts announced the world's most environmentally damaging oil spill. </p> <p>Over the next two months, a malevolent dark blanket of 11 million gallons spread 460 miles into the pristine Alaskan wilderness. It's estimated to have killed a quarter of a million seabirds, hundreds of seals and eagles, 22 killer whales, billions of fish eggs and 2,800 otters. \"It was like a war zone,\" said fisheries technician Nancy Hillstrand, who worked on a remote wildlife rescue station. \"We were getting up to 30 otters a day, all screaming.\" </p> <p>So 15 years later, after Exxon's $2 billion clean up involving 10,000 workers and the cleansing effects of countless winter storms, what will tourists find? Have the abundant natural populations fully recovered? Can you still see oil if you dig beneath the pebbly beaches? Is there any trace of the cataclysmic event? </p> <p>One of the best ways to find out is take a kayak trip. Prince William Sound, with its accessible, dramatically glaciated coastline and safe waters, is perfect for paddling. Instead of panicky oil execs and environmentalists, our eclectic group included an American publisher, IT expert and New York trader, along with a Welsh accountant. We were lead by Erik and Andy, two genial guides straight out of a Pepsi Max commercial. </p> <p>Our departure point was Valdez, the US's northernmost ice-free port. Life revolves around fishing, tourism, and, as it's the terminal of the 800-mile Trans Alaska pipeline, crude oil. But the town also drips with the unavoidable legacy of the Exxon Valdez. On arrival, the local Star and Vanguard newspaper was reporting the latest emergency response drill - one of the measures introduced after the spill. And at the Bad Ass Coffee House they still serve a hazelnut and butter rum drink named after the tanker. Slick marketing indeed. </p> <p>Down at the harbour it wasn't hard to find memories of the tumultuous spring and summer of 1989. And they weren't all bad. The massive clean up, where fishing boats were hired for big corporate bucks, had temporarily made Valdez boom. \"It was an oil rush,\" said Ed Bullock Jnr, who had ferried government officials out to soiled areas, and now skippers a salmon boat. \"Black gold, Texas tea, Alaska syrup, call it what you will. Some people made a fortune.\" </p> <p>We set off by motor launch to the drop-off point, following exactly the same route as the ill-fated tanker. It's an extraordinary setting, with some of the highest coastal mountains of the planet, riddled with glaciers, looming above 21 massive oil storage tanks - the meeting place of America's economy and its great outdoors. </p> <p>Waterfalls roared down sheer green slopes into the Sound. But our first kayaking strokes pulled us away from this main body of water, towards the chaotic blue grey toothpaste squeeze of the Shoup glacier. The boom of distant calving ice grew ever louder, as if we were approaching a military front line. </p> <p>When the channel separating Shoup's two bays became too shallow to paddle, we were forced to tramp through the water, pulling heavily laden kayaks. Foregoing wellington boots for open sandals was an early fashion mistake. It was painfully cold. The Welsh accountant squealed and appeared to start crying. Frankly, it wasn't Pepsi Max behaviour. </p> <p>But it was a salutary lesson. \"If you fall in out there you have five minutes before you're unconscious,\" said Erik, matter-of-factly. \"Your life expectancy is 15 minutes.\" </p> <p>We paddled to within three quarters of a mile of the gnarled glacier face that now cracked, groaned and roared with rushing melt water. \"I know people who kayak right up to it,\" drawled Andy. \"They haven't had children yet. Darwin will prevail.\" </p> <p>The first day also gave us a taste of the area's wildlife. Perched on a small island and every surrounding piece of ice, was a colony of 29,000 breeding pairs of kittiwakes. Their raucous cries serenaded us to sleep at a camp site that sounded terrifying - Avalanche Beach next to Bear Alley - but proved as safe as it was beautiful. </p> <p>From now on, every stroke drew us fur ther into a world resembling a David Attenborough documentary. Harbour seals, sea lions and sea otters popped up inquisitively around the kayaks, salmon rolled close to our paddles and eagles watched from the trees. We saw cormorants, loons and striking harlequin ducks - and all within sight of the super tankers heading to and from the Valdez terminal. </p> <p>To the untrained tourist eye it seemed hard to believe the abundant wildlife was still affected. But the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, formed to oversee restoration of the ecosystem using a \u00a3492 million civil settlement, paints a less rosy picture. Six of the 21 \"injured\" species, including herring, cormorants, harbour seals and harlequin ducks, have shown little or no improvement. And while many species have made \"substantial progress\", just six are fully recovered. </p> <p>Only conservationists would know. To our group it was an astonishing display of nature that peaked at Sawmill Bay. At its far shore, where a small river snaked back into dense forest, thousands of pink salmon - one of the recovered species - were heading upstream to spawn and die. Next to the churning water, the bank was littered with fish carcasses, nibbled and left by spoilt, gorged predators. </p> <p>The views kept pace with the wildlife. The only danger was scenic overload. \"Where's that?\" I asked, as we passed an amphitheatre of snow-licked peaks plunging into a fjord that would have been the jewel of most coastlines. </p> <p>\"Jack Bay,\" sniffed Andy. \"Just another inlet.\" Just as a 17-mile-long beach was just another campsite. </p> <p>After a typically substantial meal of steak, vegetables and red wine, I cast my lure into the water and within 20 seconds had hooked a plump silver salmon. Fifteen minutes later, I was dipping its bright orange flesh into wasabi and soy sauce - New York traders travel in some style - for ocean fresh sashimi without the slightest hint of hydrocarbon. After several \"s'mores\" - biscuits with melted chocolate and marshmallows - I contemplated a panorama of 27 peaks and the most scenic indigestion of my life. </p> <p>Days passed without a shred of visible evidence of the spill. The nearest we came to witnessing environmental damage was the Welsh accountant's regular campsite toilet reports: \"lovely view, good drop zone\" and more alarmingly \"private, but watch out for nasty barnacles\". </p> <p>In fact, the elements in spring 1989 had been very kind to the ravishingly beautiful north coast of Prince William Sound. Although we kayaked within six miles of Bligh Reef, the slick had flowed away south and west. Instead, it washed up in varying quantities along 1,300 miles of the Western Sound, and the Kenai and Alaska peninsulas. </p> <p>The latest survey of affected areas in Prince William in Summer 2001, found there was still oil on 20 acres of coastline, including 14 islands. Most of it was light surface pollution, but 20 of the several thousand pits dug discovered \"extremely repugnant\" sub-surface oil. You won't see it, but environmentalists fear winter storms can release isolated pockets, further injuring local wildlife. </p> <p>But it's a tiny area in the Sound's 15,000 square miles. As Dr Pam Tuomi, senior veterinarian at the Alaska SeaLife Centre, pointed out: you may spot more research vessels than 15 years ago because the spill focused attention on the crying need for monitoring and data, but \"tourists are more likely to see oil on the beach at Galveston, Texas than they are here\". </p> <p>So our six-day, 50-mile paddle, revealed nothing more sinister than an increasingly dramatic landscape. The kayaking isn't for the unfit or lazy, but tired arms were a fair exchange for the climactic views of the Columbia glacier. </p> <p>Oozing down the Chugach mountains like a fat serpent, it's over five times longer than Shoup. It's also retreating at a far more catastrophic speed: eight miles in 24 years. Cruise ships used to pull up to the face and blast their foghorns to provoke calving. Now a white field of floating ice keeps them eight miles away. We could go a couple closer, disembarking on to pebbly moraine for a 360-degree view juxtaposing vivid green meadows with dazzling snow and ice. </p> <p>On our last night, perhaps hardened by the wilderness, we fused refreshment with cryogenics, by jumping off small bergs into chest-deep water. It was hardy preparation for an unforgettable final morning when an orca arced past our kayaks, puffins zipped around our heads and a patrol of punchy sea lions jostled us well away from their 500-strong colony. It was the perfect end to a restoration drama. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> <br>Travelbag (0870 8146545, <a href=\"http://www.travelbag.co.uk\">travelbag.co.uk</a>) offers 14 nights in Anchorage, Valdez and Homer from \u00a31,012pp including flights, car hire and accommodation. </p> <p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> <br>Ramada Inn, Anchorage Downtown (+907 272 7561, <a href=\"http://www.the.ramada.com/anchorage146144\">the.ramada.com/anchorage146144</a>).

  "<p>Despite their bitter rivalry easyJet and Ryanair rarely compete on the same route. Yet next week both will begin daily flights from Stansted to Valencia. It's as if they've realised what a great trick they're missing and are now scrambling for a piece of Spain's third biggest city. </p> <p>And with good reason. The city's nightlife and restaurant scene is thriving; the architecture - from medieval gothic to ultra-modern - is stunning; and, thanks to the region's microclimate, the weather is fantastic (over 300 days of sunshine a year). Just last weekend, it was still 30C and the city's beaches were packed. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong></p> <p>Get a feel for the place by strolling around the <strong>old town</strong>. At its heart is the marble-paved <strong>Plaza de la Virgen</strong> , flanked by the cathedral and the basilica, both with intriguing mixes of gothic and classical styles. Nearby is the <strong>Mercardo Central</strong>, Europe's largest covered food market. The modernista building of stained glass and wrought iron is almost as impressive as the produce on show. The aisles of fresh glistening fish and seafood, bursting with colour, will make you regret that you are staying in a hotel - you'll want to take the lot home and cook dinner. </p> <p>Over the road, the stunning 15th-century <strong>La Lonja</strong> (silk exchange), with its elegant stone columns carved to resemble twisted bolts of silk, is the most beautiful building in Valencia and a world heritage site. </p> <p>Valencia's unique selling point is its river, or rather the lack of it. After one disastrous flood too many, the <strong>Turia</strong> was diverted to the edge of the city, leaving an empty riverbed that now forms a twisting green ribbon several kilometres long through the heart of the city, with a lagoon, trees, gardens, playing fields and cycle paths. </p> <p>The jewel in the Turia's crown is the breathtakingly ambitious <strong> City of Arts and Sciences</strong>, a project of futuristic white concrete and glass structures that soar out of the reflective pale blue pools designed primarily by local architect Santiago Calatrava. Take your pick from the Science Museum (hands-on gizmos for kids); Imax cinema and planetarium; the L'Oceanografic aquarium and Palau de les Arts, which looks like a giant armadillo and will be devoted to the performing arts when it opens next year. A combination ticket costs \u20ac28/\u20ac21 for adults/children. </p> <p>The <strong>L'Oceanografic</strong>, which opened last year, is the biggest and most ambitious in Europe, recreating whole climatic zones (Arctic, Antarctic, tropical) and housing dolphins, penguins, sealions and even small whales. While zoos have been deemed politically incorrect it seems we have no qualms about keeping these beautiful creatures in captivity. But your kids will love it. </p> <p>At the moment, the city comes to an abrupt halt at the L'Oceanografic, and the area between it and the port is one big building site. But by 2007, when the America's Cup (and the billions of euros it generates) hits town, the city will flow all the way to the sea. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To see all of the Turia plus the beach area in half a day hire a bike. Cycletour (+647 748040) next to the Gulliver's playground hires bikes for \u20ac15 a day. </p> <p><strong>Where to stay </strong></p> <p>When the five-star boutique <strong> Palau de la Mar</strong> (Navarro Reveter 14, +96 3162884, <a href=\"http://www.hospes.es\">hospes.es</a>) opened this summer, it instantly raised the bar for the rest of the city, in terms of comfort and style. The striking black and white design works beautifully on the hotel's huge airy rooms and ginormous beds. Doubles are \u20ac120 per night at weekends (breakfast is an extra \u20ac12pp). </p> <p>Right in the heart of the city, the <strong>Petit Palace Bristol</strong> (C/Abad\u00eda de San Martin 3, +963 945 100, <a href=\"http://www.hthotels.com\">hthotels.com</a>) is another smart boutique hotel. All the clean, sleek rooms have free internet access and multi-jet power showers (doubles \u20ac107 at weekends, B&amp;B). </p> <p>The stylish, intimate <strong>Ad Hoc</strong> (C/Boix 4, +963 919 140, <a href=\"http://www.adhochoteles.com\">adhochoteles.com</a>) is one of the best smaller hotels in the city. Like many Valenciano establishments, it offers greatly discounted weekend rates (\u20ac88 B&amp;B double). All rooms are the same price, so ask for one of the bigger ones with a balcony. </p> <p><strong>Where to eat</strong></p> <p>The city's gift to the world is, of course, the paella. As with our roast dinner, the best ones are cooked at home on a Sunday afternoon, but a good alternative can be had at the <strong>beach</strong> near the port where there are a string of large, bustling restaurants. The popular <strong>La Pepica</strong> (Paseo Neptuno 16, +963 710 018) is the most famous (Hemingway and King Juan Carlos have eaten here) and full of Valenciano families. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Llac Albufera (Arabic for 'little sea') 10km south of town is both a rice-growing and fishing region - which means fantastic paellas. The beaches are better here, too. </p> <p><strong>Seu-Xerea</strong> (+963 924 000, <a href=\"http://www.seuxerea.tdv.net\">seuxerea.tdv.net</a>) in the old town serves excellent Spanish fusion dishes - baby tuna with teriyaki, stuffed rabbit with mustard sauce - and has a well-priced regional wine list. The taster menu is a snip at \u20ac39. </p> <p><strong>Where to drink</strong></p> <p>Agua de Valencia is the refreshing local cocktail made with freshly squeezed orange juice, cava and whichever spirit takes the barmen's fancy. Many Valencia bars appear to have been thrown together with a few thousand euros, lots of enthusiasm and the odd tin of red paint - yet they ooze atmosphere. You'll find these in the Carmen district in the old town where chic and grunge co-habit happily in a hive of tapas bars, cafes and clubs. </p> <p>A great place to people watch is the lively terrace of <strong>Sant Jaume</strong> (C/Cavalleros 51) set in a beautiful old modernista pharmacy. <strong>Caf\u00e9 da las Horas</strong>, just off Plaza de la Virgen, is also chilled and atmospheric. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong>Getting there: </strong> <br>Magic of Spain (0870 8880220, <a href=\"http://www.magictravelgroup.co.uk\">magictravelgroup.co.uk</a>) offers three nights at the three-star Petit Palace Bristol from \u00a3330pp B&amp;B including from Gatwick flights.

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I have made that trip on the night sleeper a number of times, although not for about five years. The Riga train used to leave Vilnius at around 11pm and would arrive in Riga at 6am. The only drawback was the border control at some ungodly hour of the morning. They would lock the loos at the border crossing so you couldn't even combine this rude awakening with some light relief! </p> <p>The sleepers, much like the French couchettes, are known as \"coupe\" (pronounced as an Englishman, not an American, would say the sportscar). They used to be mixed sex and I always found my fellow travellers to be kind and helpful, despite my beginners' grasp of Russian. Be aware of using Russian today as these countries are now independent and have their own languages. I learned to begin a conversation by saying in Russian \"I'm sorry but I only speak a bit of Russian\" to show I appreciated they may not want to converse in that language. </p> <p>You do sometimes hear of problems on the trains so, if you are on your own, do as I was once shown to do by the Bulgarian conductor on a Budapest-Warsaw sleeper: wedge a shoe in the safety chain lock so the door cannot be slid back enough for a small hand to reach around and slip the chain. </p> <p>The booking system is efficient, but try to book the previous day. Make sure you find your allocated space; I didn't on the first trip I made and, having stowed heavy cases and with absolutely no understanding of the language, was unceremoniously moved out and on to my correct seat. You'll find most of your fellow travellers will change into tracksuits and flip-flops (\"Schlopskis\" in Russian) when the train moves off, so a pair of flip-flops would be useful. </p> <p>Be prepared to be ripped off by the taxi drivers when you arrive in Riga. They pounce on the rather bleary-eyed passengers who are in no real state to argue the outrageous fare suggested. Finally, have fun, I always had a wonderful time in that part of the world and I'm sure you will too. <br> John Sidgwick </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Yes it is possible but the service is not very frequent, fast or direct. It's only 350km but can take anything between seven and 14 hours. Most people seem to take the Eurolines bus or fly (only 55 minutes). </p> <p>As well as using national rail companies' websites, I find the Thomas Cook European timetable a good way of getting the big picture on which routes are the main ones and so likely to have a quicker, more frequent service. It's good value at a tenner from <a href=\"http://www.thomascookpublishing.com\">Thomas Cook</a> headquarters in Peterborough. Don't waste your time asking for the timetable at Thomas Cook branches; they are likely to tell you it doesn't exist.<br>Adrian Tayler </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I investigated this option earlier this year. There is no direct rail service anymore due to the state of the track (the official explanation anyway), and there hasn't been for a year or two. I'm not sure if it's possible to change trains, while staying within the two countries concerned. There are options via Belarus, but you'll need an expensive transit visa for travel via this route.<br>Don Bradley </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I advise going by bus rather than train for two reasons. First, the state of trains in the Baltic States is still rather poor, although things are improving. Second, the time taken by train is much longer than by bus. Eurolines operates a service that runs from Kaliningrad to Tallinn hitting Vilnius and Riga along the way. This service will leave Vilnius five or more times a day with a cost of about \u00a37 return if only going to Riga. You can either book in advance at <a href=\"http://www.eurolines.it\">Eurolines</a> or get better prices and services by going to a travel agency once you arrive in Vilnius. If you buy through the latter, they will have first-hand information on which bus stop you need. I have travelled Eurolines many times across the Baltic States and never had a problem.<br> David Galbreath, Aberdeen</p>",
  "The rural middle class seldom enthuses about the law courts these days, for they are perceived as absurdly indulgent to hooligans, asylum seekers, murderers and malefactors of all kinds. Yet a mighty cheer went up on Tuesday, following the conviction of a career burglar named John Rae, who was jailed for seven years for a long series of offences. <p>The cause of the applause was that Judge Andrew Hamilton endorsed the action of a 73-year-old Derbyshire farmer, Kenneth Faulkner, who shot Rae in the leg during an attempted break-in, after an earlier burglary in which some of his guns had been stolen. \"Mr Faulkner believed that he was being targeted,\" said the judge, \"and he was entirely right. He wrongly believed that the burglars had come back armed with those guns that had been stolen. Very sensibly he took out his own shotgun. No one could criticise him for what he did.\" </p> <p>The judge went on to deplore the fact that the Crown Prosecution Service considered charges of assault against the farmer, which were dropped only shortly before Rae's trial. Here at last, in the minds of many country people, was a sensible judicial view about a man's right to protect himself. </p> <p>The police, however, seemed thoroughly alarmed by the judge's comments. No doubt envisaging a barrage of gunfire against suspected intruders, the Association of Chief Police Officers issued a statement urging householders not to resist. Instead, said Acpo, they should lock themselves into a room and dial 999: \"You should not approach the intruder. If the intruder steals some of your property, that's far better than someone being killed.\" </p> <p>These words prompted a jeer of derision in many a village pub. The police have a rotten record of effective intervention at scenes of rural crime. The shortcomings of law enforcement were highlighted the very next day, when a fiasco was reported in the press. A farmer who caught and successfully detained two intruders stealing tractor diesel fuel from his tank in the presence of witnesses was told that the thieves would not be prosecuted \"for lack of evidence\". Critics demand: how can the police with straight faces urge householders to rely on the law, when the law is an ass? </p> <p>About now, some readers may suppose that I am launching a manifesto for the right of property owners to shoot down burglars. Not so. The doctrine of \"proportionate force\" in resisting crime, enshrined in existing law, seems absolutely correct. I have owned guns all my life. Yet, unless I perceived myself and my loved ones facing an indisputable threat to our own lives, I cannot imagine attempting to shoot somebody. </p> <p>In the United States, gun ownership is widespread. A right to defend property is recognised in law. The consequence is that there are horrific cases of innocent people being gunned down by mistake, for instance when they knock up a house at night to ask directions. Some Americans argue that this is a price worth paying for achieving a burglary rate much lower than that which prevails in Europe. Most of us dissent. </p> <p>British law dealt harshly with the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin, who received a long term of imprisonment after shooting a burglar dead. A token sentence seemed more appropriate, when Martin had been grievously provoked by repeated visits from inveterate thieves. </p> <p>Yet I could never share the view that the farmer was a middle-class martyr. Evidence made it plain that he had deliberately shot the burglar dead while he was attempting to flee. He faced no plausible threat to his own safety. How can the law not uphold the sanctity of human life, even that of a professional criminal? </p> <p>It is hard to see a rational basis for the current campaign for new legislation, to allow householders to use more force in defending their property. What seems needed is a more sensitive approach by the authorities towards the predicament of people living in the countryside who suffer from crime. </p> <p>Everybody has his or her horror story, and few report an effective police response. Some middle-aged friends of ours were visited a few years ago in their remote house by a gang who tied them up and tortured them for some hours, to persuade them to disclose the whereabouts of non-existent valuables and cash. Psychologically, the couple have never recovered from the ordeal. </p> <p>In recent months there has been a string of big country-house burglaries in our area, for which the suspects are well-known, but no successful prosecutions have yet resulted. The farmyard behind our own home was recently stripped of an assortment of power tools, a common form of petty larceny. So what, you may say? Yet if people live alone, some distance from other habitations, and especially if they are elderly, fear becomes very real. If attacked in the country, people can shout their heads off for aid without hope of being heard. Rural dwellers really are on their own. Once a local attack has taken place, the familiar, precious sense of security in one's own home is hard to maintain. </p> <p> A s alarm systems become commonplace, more and more rural crimes are deliberately undertaken when premises are known to be occupied, and thus alarms are switched off. An elderly couple near us were visited recently by two men posing as meter readers, who beat them severely before making off with their pitiful spoils. There seems a good case for awarding an exceptional sentence to any criminal who knowingly targets the old. </p> <p>I do not want to exaggerate, to suggest that a reign of terror has seized rural Britain. National burglary statistics show a decline. Yet in the countryside, the increasing willingness of intruders to assault occupied houses is much more disturbing than a risk of the place being ransacked when it is empty. </p> <p>Judicial verdicts over recent years in cases where residents have tangled with intruders suggest that the balance of police and court sympathy has tilted too sharply in favour of the criminal, too strongly against the householder. Today we need not new law, but simply more wisdom and sympathy from police and judges. </p> <p>It is not necessary to be a rabid rightwinger to feel disgusted by instances in which illegal intruders have invoked civil law against the owners of premises they have wilfully invaded. Legal institutions command public respect only when they are seen to strike a proper mean between the law-abiding citizen and the criminal. </p> <p>It is the apparent loss of that mean which has done such harm to the relationship between police and the middle class in recent years. When the CPS investigates an attempted burglary in which a householder has used violence against the suspect, prosecutors seem to treat both as morally indistinguishable putative criminal offences. This must be wrong. </p> <p>Judge Andrew Hamilton's remarks in this week's burglary case deserve applause not because they promise country dwellers an open season on burglars, which they do not and should not, but because they take a step towards restoring a sensible balance. I do not expect the law to offer me a right to kill a burglar, but I want its agents to display a modest prejudice in my favour if I resist. If such prejudice is lacking, then so will be public respect for justice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "You rightly report that the new Conservative housing strategy pledges to extend the right to buy to 1 million tenants, which is seen \"as a popular measure for middle- and lower-income families\" (Tories housing strategy 'comes close to playing race card', October 28). <p>We hope it will be particularly popular with ethnic- minority families. So we were surprised that an officer of the National Housing Federation suggested the policy document came \"close to playing the race card\".</p> <p>He criticised it for saying that the effect of immigration on housing demand \"is much more significant than relocation from the north to the south of England\". This is a matter of fact. The main analysis of the figures is The Housing Consequences of Migration, published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. They show that even during the 1990s, net migration from the rest of the UK accounted for only 9% of population growth in the south.</p> <p>They conclude that \"the driving forces are net inward migration from outside the UK and natural increase, which together ensure substantial net outward migra tion from London to the rest of the south\".</p> <p>The reason for concern is nothing to do with race. Immigrants overwhelmingly make a positive contribution to Britain. The problem is that the pressures of overcrowding are unprecedented - housing shortages, water shortages, jammed roads and overloaded infrastructure. None of that overrides our obligation to help refugees. But asylum seekers are only a minority: most immigrants come on work permits which the government has boosted fourfold since 1997 to 200,000 a year. For most of our history Britain has been a net exporter of people: it is bizarre that now our population's at a record level this government should think Britain has the scope to import people on a large scale.</p> <p>Land is finite. Either we set sensible limits on immigration, or we relinquish large areas of our remaining countryside. If things continue as they are for much longer, we may well have to do both.<br> <b>Peter Lilley MP</b><br> <b>Angela Watkinson MP</b><br> <b>Teddy Taylor MP</b><br> <b>Julian Brazier MP</b><br> <b>Henry Bellingham MP</b><br> <b>Michael Fallon MP</b><br></p> <p>It would be inaccurate to suggest that immigration is the major cause of the need for homes. There are three key reasons for the increase in the number of households: people are living longer, more people are choosing to live alone and more people are moving into the country than are moving out.</p> <p>According to the latest government household projections (Projections of house- holds in England 2021) inward migration into England accounts for less than one-third of the increase in the number of households being formed within the country.</p> <p>The particular pressure on the south-east comes from the economic success and employment potential of the region. We need new people to provide essential services, if we are to sustain our economic growth. These people need homes, as do we who are living longer, and as will our children in the future.<br> <b>Caroline Green</b><br> Town and Country Planning Association<br></p> <p> </p> <p>The area of Norfolk is around 1.3m acres and the population is less than 800,000 (Fields of dreams, G2, October 25). Norwich occupies around 7,500 acres and houses a population of about 120,000. The largest city in the county, and the biggest concentration of population therefore occupies less than two-thirds of 1% of the available land area. So a new city the size of Norwich could be created without significantly diminishing the area of land available for agriculture, leisure activities or wildlife. There is a real debate to be had about the future of land use in this country, one that will move us on from the pre-war concerns enshrined in the town and country planning acts.<br> <b>Duncan Roberts</b><br> Belford, Northumberland<br></p>",
  "<p><strong> Humphrey Jennings</strong> <br>by Kevin Jackson <br>448pp, Picador, \u00a330 </p> <p><strong> Forgotten Voices of the Second World War</strong> <br>edited by Max Arthur <br>486pp, Ebury, \u00a319.99 </p> <p><strong> Our Hidden Lives</strong> <br>edited by Simon Garfield <br>536pp, Ebury, \u00a319.99</p> <p>January 1937, Blackheath, London: a group of young artists and writers have agreed on the urgent need for an anthropological study of the lives of ordinary Britons. Cultural hooligan Tom Harrisson, who will soon dominate the project, to be known as Mass-Observation, is talking at the top of his voice, while leaning on one end of the mantlepiece. On its other end rests the angular elbow of an even more full-throttle speaker, the surrealist artist, documentary-maker and cultural historian, Humphrey Jennings, who will soon quit Mass-Observation because it does not seem to connect with the poetry of the collective unconscious. </p> <p>By this moment, half-way into Kevin Jackson's biography, you can envisage Jennings clearly. Blond hair. Green teeth. Possibly wearing the ginger Harris tweed overcoat that enwrapped much of his brief life. Superconfident in manner; he was a prizewinning guineapig for the English Literature degree and new criticism at Cambridge. He was physically vain - he jumped about the Parisian bed he shared briefly with Peggy Guggenheim, demanding \"Don't you think I'm beautiful?\". And he was selfish, too - his accidental death on location in 1950 left his wife and children with \u00a31 in the bank; she had to return to the dealer a rare book on parrots he'd just indulged in, price \u00a325. Yet he also possessed a genius for human sympathy. </p> <p>You can hear him, too. Jackson has researched all the reported speech - Jennings talked constantly, communications dense in content and poetic in form. He has read everything Jennings wrote and shows that his genius was as much for synthesising as sympathising. Jackson has also watched Jennings's wartime documentaries so often that the best pages are cinematic in his master's style; beyond the true images and accurate dialogue, you sense an invisible and unspoken mystery. </p> <p>In that sequence by the fireplace, Jackson projects the frame in which Jennings first came into full focus, enthusing about the project that led him to the wartime films. Until Blackheath, he'd been a clever eccentric from Suffolk leaping hurdles to Cambridge, appearing to have intel lectual promise in all directions. </p> <p>After Blackheath, while still multitasking to support his wife and a bibliophile addiction, he was off to snap Mass-Observations's \"Worktown\"(Bolton) and take pictures and make notes of George VI's coronation day, arranged into a volume that prefigured his films. Among the crowds, he encountered both the shared feelings and intense individuality of ordinary people. It gave him heart; it gave him a heart. Jackson dates the transformation through a 1938 broadcast in which Jennings linked the idea of a \"triumph\" (a gala show) via the poet laureate - \"laureate\" because garlanded with the laurels of a triumph - with the enormous poetic emotions evident in newsreels of momentous events. </p> <p>Making inspiring connections of his own, Jackson understands that Jennings became the poet laureate of the second world war; his films are of the ordinary people's triumphs that \"tell them who they are, by reminding them who they have been... reminding them of the mysteries of the everyday\". Jackson explores the crucial reciprocity between the highly individual consciousness of Jennings and the collective unconscious of a nation, in Jennings's words, \"secretly delighted with the privilege of holding up Hitler\"; between Jennings's personal image bank - the burning house Tarot card, the sacrifice who dies so a new man may rise - and the terrible public experience of those images when he shot Fires Were Started. Jackson is fascinated by the interraction between the film-maker and his re-enacters of the real - the auxiliary firemen of the East End playing themselves, the mining families of the Welsh village of Cwmgiedd acting as proxies for the Czechs of Nazi-obliterated Lidice. It's usual for a biographer to document what his subject said and did; Jackson demonstrates how Jennings listened to ordinary people whose innate unordinariness was exposed by war. Every word is worth hearing, such as those in the letter that miner's agent Dai Evans wrote to a disheartened Jennings - \"men will expressive their creative ability, just as working-class women make miniature palaces of hovels\". </p> <p>Would Jennings have continued to listen when Britons were no longer magnificently transfigured by war? Jackson's coda sadly implies not - his few post-war films thinned and stiffened. He painted, journalised, laboured again at his project, Pandaemonium, an encyclopedic cut and paste \"documentary\" (extracts from documents) of the idea of the machine and the industrial revolution, only published in 1985. Perhaps, but for that cliff death fall in 1950, he would have led the broadcast documentary-makers from the late 1950s radio ballads to the television triumphs of the 1970s, instead of only inspiring them - The World at War , especially, is in debt to him for more than clips. It owes him its heart and soul. </p> <p>In fact, many people's recollections of 1939-45 (as excerpted in the Imperial War Museum's oral history) connect with Jennings at a mythic level. Sometimes he seems to have scripted their recall - the London fireman responding to Churchill's demand that St Paul's Cathedral be saved at all costs: \"Now every fireman, without being told... lined their backs to St Paul's and pointed their jets outwards to make sure that no fire would reach St Paul's.\" Sometimes he seems to have arranged the surreal juxtapositions they saw: the British POW describing leaving post-atom bomb Nagasaki by horse-drawn cart as the green rice crop ripened brown in an afternoon while kites, defeathered by fire, wandered on foot. </p> <p>Max Arthur's on-the-page montages honour Jennings's creed \"to bring together is to transform\": the volunteer canteen driver who allowed a soldier, frightened by a flying bomb, to calm his nerves by washing up precedes the boy who delivered death telegrams: \"I saw the curtain twitch as I knocked... and the lady came out. 'That's for me, isn't it?', she said.\" They are separated or maybe conjoined by the words of the German pilot officer who launched the rockets. </p> <p>One thing Jennings was wrong about was his belief that Mass-Observation's thousands of observers would lack poetry. Even in the most depressed post-war years, the Mass-Observation diaries of nobodies are profound with the mysteries of the everyday. Simon Garfield has chosen five participants: the South African socialist wife of a football fan; an Esperanto-speaking accountant; an unsuccessful writer taking in paying guests to feed her cats and her ciggie habit; a gay theatre dresser turned antique dealer in Edinburgh; and Herbert Brush, retired, keeper of an allotment where he raised celeriac, artichokes and garlic. His Pooterism is blissful: \"I paid my usual visit to the bank manager for him to certify that I am still alive. I gave him a couple of large tomatoes.\" </p> <p>This surreal crew are painfully real in their revealed ambiguities: all anti-Semitic in their views, almost to rabidity, yet with unexpected tolerances and generosities. Time has transformed their trivial entries into the sublime; their important days will always resonate. How Jennings would have connected with the Edinburgh observation for November 9 1947. The antique dealer entertained two German prisoners-of-war, who mended shirts and fixed curtains. They kept the armistice day (Remembrance Sunday) two-minute silence together in the kitchen. One POW, Hermann, had brought a gift of two turnips. Potato rationing had just been introduced.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> The news that Boris Johnson had become a football terrace chant - Millwall fans sang \"there's only one Boris Johnson\" to taunt Liverpool supporters this week - made me wonder how many other people, apart from footballers and managers have received this signal honour. There was that man who killed two policemen who was the subject of the \"he kills coppers\" chant of many years ago. But I can't think, off hand, of anyone else - least of all a Conservative MP and magazine editor. <p><b>\u00b7</b> We have a new Tesco in our neighbourhood, and outside it last weekend I bumped into Greg Dyke. I asked him if it was true that he had a new licence plate for his car and he said \"come and see it\". And there it was, parked outside the laundrette, a silver Lexus with plates reading M16 WMD. An astute person at the licensing authority had spotted it and wanted to know if he would like it. If I were one of those people who had helped get rid of Greg and the chairman, Gavyn Davies, I would be worried. Greg is a man quite prepared to eat his revenge cold, ice cold if necessary, but in large quantities and with relish. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I've been reading Hiding The Elephant by Jim Steinmeyer (Heinemann, \u00a314.99). I love tales of the old magicians; how they did their tricks, their rivalries, hatreds and theft of each other's ideas. One story is about Howard Thurston, the American magician who perfected the levitating lady trick. This was quite easily done with scores of fine wires, painted with something that didn't reflect the light. Thurston used to invite a man and a boy onto the stage to inspect the illusion. As one of the boys revealed later, when he was grown up: \"I saw more damn wires than I'd ever seen in my life. As Thurston lifted me up, he whispered, 'if you touch any of those blankety-blank wires ...' Well, I'd never heard language like that in my life. I opened my eyes and my mouth wide, which made everyone in the audience think I was amazed at what I was seeing. They all laughed and applauded ...\" </p> <p>Any idiot can make a lady float or saw her in half. The true genius comes in moments like that one. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I had one of those moments of terror this week, the kind that make you think \"this must be a dream, and any moment I'm going to wake up\". But you don't. </p> <p>I was doing a live turn on BBC News 24 about the Commons' decision to drop the term strangers and call visitors members of the public. I was at Westminster; the interviewer in west London. Before we started, my earpiece, which feeds in the questions, had fallen out a couple of times, but I thought I had jammed it safely back in. I was wrong. When the interviewer had asked the second question it fell out. Though I was staring at the camera with a wild surmise, I could see myself peripherally on the monitor, grasping maniacally for the thing, but reaching only the microphone wire. Then as I chuntered on, answering questions which I might possibly have been asked, I could see myself twisting to the floor, like a man being attacked by a crack squad of anacondas. In the end a technician found half the thing on the floor, and the other on my back collar. The News 24 people were very nice about it, but I don't suppose they'll have me back soon. Say what you like about Andrew Marr, but he is a safe pair of ears. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Your family sayings are still pouring in. Laurence Inman writes from Birmingham about his friend Professor Chris Brooks, an expert on things Victorian. \"He edited a book about the Albert Memorial, and was present at the unveiling when it wasrestored. We clamoured to know what the royal family were really like. Charles: 'very knowledgeable'; the Queen Mum: 'tiny'. When it came to the boss he looked very thoughtful and said: 'I just can't talk to the Queen.' So whenever she appears on telly ...\" </p> <p>On another occasion Mr Inman mentioned to Prof Brooks that he was going on holiday to Branscombe. Did he know the place? \"I think I wrote a book about it once,\" was the answer. This is now the family's stock reply to any request for information. </p> <p>Karen Lane from Ilford says her late grandmother was famous for mangled proverbs. \"When she came out with some particularly garbled bit of folklore and was met with the usual amusement and incomprehension, she retorted 'It may be an old fallacy, but it's true!' - now our stock response to anything met with the slightest incredulity.\" </p> <p>Diana Brodie from Cambridge says her daughter and son-in-law love cooking Indian food. Once they assembled a samosa as big as a baking tray. The recipe was helpful up to the bit where you had to cook the thing. \"The next instruction was: 'simply lift the giant samosa'. Now we use it whenever we are following difficult instructions, assembling flatpack furniture, for example - 'simply lift the giant samosa'.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Last week I mistakenly attributed the Turn The Tables event to Macmillan Cancer Care. It was actually organised by Cancer Research UK. Apologies.</p>",
  "America's electoral battlefield spread out to the far-flung state of Hawaii yesterday as the Democratic and Republican campaigns turned out their highest voltage celebrities in a last dash for votes. <p>After weeks in which the main poll fighting was restricted to fewer than a dozen of the 50 states, the campaign's horizons stretched out to Hawaii, a hitherto Democratic bastion in the mid-Pacific. </p> <p>The two big parties, meanwhile, resorted to the world of celebrity to give an extra sizzle to their campaigns, and to draw in the dwindling band of undecided voters. </p> <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, former bodybuilder and Republican governor of California, joined President Bush at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, and urged the party faithful with typical vigour not to let up. </p> <p>\"Today I'm here to pump you up,\" he intoned in a speech bursting with self-referential quips. \"If you flex your muscles on November 2 I guarantee you, President Bush will be back.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush produced a pun of his own. \"He and I share some things in common - we both married well, we both have trouble speaking the English language, we both got big biceps. Well, two out of three ain't bad.\" </p> <p>For the Democrats, meanwhile, there was Bruce Springsteen, who turned out tens of thousands of people at rallies in Wisconsin and Ohio on Thursday night, delivering live renditions of the anthem that Mr Kerry has adopted as his theme song, No Surrender. The rock star was to accompany Mr Kerry to Florida later yesterday. </p> <p>The Democrats also plan to roll out the party's in-house \"rock star\" for one last tour before voting day. Bill Clinton, who rose from his sick bed earlier this week after heart surgery, goes on the road again to Nevada and New Mexico. </p> <p>Mr Clinton ends his tour tomorrow in his native Arkansas, a state that voted for Mr Bush in 2000, but which the Democrats are hoping to prise away this time round. It carries a potentially crucial six electoral college votes. </p> <p>Mr Bush had hoped to harness another celebrity yesterday by campaigning with Boston Red Sox pitcher, Curt Schilling, who is basking in his team's first World Series victory for 86 years. </p> <p>Schilling, a Texan who thrilled fans by playing with an injured and bleeding ankle, told a television interviewer on Thursday he was voting for Mr Bush. He was immediately signed up by the Republicans to accompany the president to New Hampshire today. </p> <p>The endorsement came as a rebuff to Mr Kerry, who is a passionate supporter of the team and wore a Red Sox cap on the campaign trail this week in honour of their victory. In the end, Schilling cancelled the appearance, saying he had been advised by doctors to rest his ankle. </p> <p>The spotlight on Hawaii is a first in modern American election campaigns. President Bush has visited the state just once, in 2001, and the last major presidential candidate to come calling was Richard Nixon in 1960. </p> <p>But two newspaper polls this week showing the Republicans within striking distance of the Democrats put the islands in play, with a ferocious last-minute battle for its relatively puny prize of four electoral college votes. </p> <p>On Thursday, the Democrats dropped $200,000 (\u00a3110,000) in new television advertising on the state, and both sides were to send in high-powered campaigners at the weekend. For the Democrats, Mr Kerry's daughter, Alexandra, was to appear at a rally last night along with former vice-president Al Gore. </p> <p>Vice-President Dick Cheney takes his turn late tomorrow night, logging an additional 13 hours in the air, and a 38-hour bout of campaigning in the final hours of the campaign. </p> <p>Since attaining statehood in 1959, Hawaii has swung Republican in only two elections. Mr Gore won the state by nearly 20 percentage points in 2000. But the merest glimmer that Hawaii could be up for grabs is enough to get the two campaigns moving. </p> <p>\"Hawaii is a state where the president's leadership resonates,\" Mr Cheney's spokeswoman, Ann Womack, told reporters. \"It's a very close race. We think it's worth a trip.\"</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United and Arsenal hoard much of the Premiership's wealth, but these clubs hold no monopoly on animosity. The entire fixture list is a tangle of sensitive personal histories, long-cherished grudges and wounded feelings. This weekend presents us with a perfect set of case studies. </p> <p>The meeting of Birmingham City and Crystal Palace this afternoon may, for example, be a rather unappetising prospect for the general public, but many of the people who will assemble at St Andrews can barely wait to get their teeth into it. </p> <p>The fans who have travelled from the south will vilify Steve Bruce. Having taken the manager's post at Selhurst Park in the summer of 2001, he soon spoke of his happiness at finding a club where he felt wanted. The fondness cannot have been reciprocated all that strongly by him because he left for Birmingham at the end of the year. </p> <p>Any spare antagonism in the visiting support today can be directed at Julian Gray. He declined to sign a new contract with Palace, who therefore received no fee when he opted, as a free agent, to be reunited with Bruce at St Andrews. The crowd, all the same, are not the only ones with an excuse to brood. </p> <p>The Palace midfielder Michael Hughes was fleetingly on Birmingham's books. He went there on loan from Wimbledon in March 2002. Although he then injured his ankle, it was his understanding that he was guaranteed a longer-term deal if Birmingham achieved promotion to the Premiership that season, as they duly did. </p> <p>Instead, Hughes soon required financial support from the PFA as the dispute kept him out of football for 16 months until he received compensation from Birmingham. Fellow professionals sympathised, but the Northern Ireland international will not expect unmitigated solidarity from them today. </p> <p>His excessive challenge on Robbie Savage provoked a reaction as both of them were sent off in the 2-2 draw with Wales at the Millen nium Stadium last month. There was some sympathy with the argument that Savage, for once, was the wronged party. A player who frequently seems to be at odds with the rest of the human race was soon heard invoking his own human rights when a one-match ban was imposed. </p> <p>This is a week when there have been several demonstrations that combativeness is part of the life force of football. It is pointless and even hypocritical to be scandalised when the contentiousness that makes the sport so exciting to us smashes through its flimsy boundaries. </p> <p>Should good manners be maintained at St Andrews, with Palace's Andy Johnson stifling an impulse to gloat if he happens to score against the club that off-loaded him, we ought to pause and appreciate how much decorum survives despite all the provocative factors. </p> <p>There are more and more causes of friction. Now that Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have virtually separated themselves from the remainder of the Premiership, the games between them are breeding grounds for obsession. When Arsenal went to Old Trafford last weekend, every detail of their previous visit a year before was vivid in their minds. </p> <p>It was all too simple for them to resume the antagonism with Ruud van Nistelrooy that had arisen in the 2003 match. If Arsenal are guilty of throwing food and soup in the tunnel afterwards their conduct was pathetic as well as wrong, but no one should be surprised when incidents get out of control in a competition so overblown that a tussle for three points can be deemed the game of the decade. </p> <p>In the Premiership, everything tends to be expanded until it becomes unignorable. Jamie Carragher seems ready to act with dispassionate professionalism today when he faces Blackburn's Lucas Neill, who broke the Liverpool full-back's leg last year, but the Anfield audience may not be so inclined to let bygones be bygones, particularly if the visitors are doing well. </p> <p>Football is being asked to suppress an ever-increasing potential for uproar. The sport is operated in a rampantly commercial manner yet it is marketed with an appeal to old-fashioned ties and feelings. Spectators are urged to flaunt their devotion to their clubs, but at the same time it is guaranteed that they will be betrayed sooner or later. </p> <p>Clubs seek to transfer players while they can still get a fee for them and the footballers depart in search of improvement or just their next signing-on fee. The behaviour of some of the West Ham fans at Chelsea on Wednesday was despicable, but there were ready targets for the louts. Although Mateja Kezman was hit by a coin, objects were also thrown at Joe Cole and Frank Lampard, who used to be on the Upton Park payroll. </p> <p>In so many matches nowadays, the line-up for the opposing team borders on a roll call of hate figures. This afternoon the Spurs midfielder Sean Davis goes back to Fulham, where he claimed not so long ago to see his entire future. As the game at St Andrews shows, the moves that players make often string a cat's cradle of resentments across the land. </p> <p>Football is a mobile profession. The Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho understood the consequences well enough to beg Uefa not to take action against his former club when a Porto fan spat on him a month ago. The general restraint of people in football is more noteworthy than the occasional eruptions. </p> <p>We ask those in the game to endure loathing, to commit all their emotional reserves and, in the case of the players, to be constantly aggressive while stopping a hair's breadth short of mayhem. All in all, the FA can count itself lucky that there are so few outrages to be investigated. </p> <p><strong>Five of the greatest grudges ever:</strong></p> <p><strong> Norman Hunter and Peter Osgood</strong> </p> <p> Chelsea and Leeds had perhaps the greatest long-running rivalry of the 70s, starting with a bad-tempered FA Cup final replay in 1970, and Hunter and Osgood were at its centre. \"There was a tremendous rivalry between Ossie and myself,\" said Hunter. \"You started getting into him a bit and to be fair he'd come back at you, would Ossie. He wasn't afraid at all.\" Fans still talk wistfully of a famous sideburn-pulling incident (Hunter was doing the pulling) later in 1970. </p> <p> <strong> England and Argentina</strong> </p> <p> It all started in 1966, when England beat Argentina in a World Cup quarter-final at Wembley, the visiting captain Antonio Rattin was sent off but refused to go, and Alf Ramsey described the Argentinians as \"animals\". Then there was a war in the Falklands and Maradona's Hand of God in Mexico. \"We knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds,\" Maradona wrote. \"And this was revenge.\" English players were riled by aggressive gloating after the 1998 World Cup penalty shoot-out defeat, and gained revenge of their own in 2002. Still simmering. </p> <p> <strong> Roy Keane and Alf Inge Haaland</strong> </p> <p> It is not a good idea to taunt Roy Keane, particularly when he is injured. Haaland made that mistake, and in April 2001 Keane got his revenge with a career-ending tackle. \"I'd waited long enough,\" the Irishman wrote in his autobiography. \"I hit him hard. Take that, you c***. And don't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries.\" </p> <p> <strong> Graeme Souness and Terry Yorath</strong> </p> <p> In the years when Scotland and Wales often played each other, these two were always scrapping. \"There's no friction on my part,\" said Yorath innocently after one clash in 1979, \"but I always seem to have trouble from him.\" </p> <p> <strong> Graeme Le Saux and Mauricio Taricco</strong> </p> <p> In September 2001 Le Saux had to be restrained from attacking Taricco after the final whistle, Chelsea having beaten Spurs at White Hart Lane. He alleged he had been punched in the face. In March 2002 Le Saux was sent off for a dreadful tackle on the Argentinian, minutes after Taricco had come off the bench. Three days later the sides met again and sure enough Taricco was sent off for a foul on Le Saux described by the referee Alan Wiley as \"high, late and very dangerous\".</p>"
