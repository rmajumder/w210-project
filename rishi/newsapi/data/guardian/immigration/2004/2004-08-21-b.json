  "<p>Inside my dining room cabinet is a green card with a set of numbers on it. They are contact numbers at the university where my youngest son, the third of my children to go, is studying and were sent to us, together with an advice leaflet for parents, when we paid his first term's hall of residence rent. </p> <p>We paid the rent, even though he took out a loan, because said rent amounted to \u00a32,800 for the year, more than the loan. If we hadn't paid it, he would not have eaten or bought books.</p> <p>He picked the card up when his first year ended and came home. \"What is this?\" he asked, eyeing it and me suspiciously. \"A card that was sent to us,\" I said. \"I just stuck it there because ... well what else was I to do?\"</p> <p>What indeed? Sussex, no slouch as universities go, one of those keen on producing thinking adults as graduates, had sent me the card. I was about to bin it, but I got a guilty twinge. If they thought I needed to be able to reach them quickly, then maybe I did? </p> <p>My son and I talked it through. We had this conversation sitting in the sun with a beer each. Three years ago, when he was 17 and studying English at A-level, we went to see Ethan Hawke playing Hamlet and then, in the heart of London's West End, I offered to buy him a beer. In the first pub we walked into, the Australian barmaid asked me to prove he was old enough to drink. We turned on our heels and went to the pub across the road, where they served us without a glance. </p> <p>The feeling I had then matched the feeling the address card prompted. Did someone out there forget that children grow up? Maybe 17 is young for beer, even with your mum. But at 20, after a gap year working to earn your passage then travelling through Vietnam and Thailand, surely you are old enough to look after yourself at university without your parents having access to a \"Big Sir\" to check your progress? </p> <p>In the five years since my oldest son went to university the degree to which parents are expected, indeed invited, to be part of their undergraduate offspring's academic life has mushroomed alarmingly. It has spread to match the increasing parental hysteria about getting baby into the most hot-housed nursery, into worrying about primary school Sats results and about secondary school GCSE A-C grade results. </p> <p>Throughout that time I have been writing about university education and talking, as a journalist, to admissions tutors around the country about many topics, not least the emotional wellbeing of undergraduates and their ability to handle university life. </p> <p>It appears that there is a correlation between the emotional maturity of the undergraduate and their ability to survive, and indeed benefit, from university. It is something akin to the toughness of a plant that has grown outdoors. </p> <p>All admissions tutors agree that the more emotionally mature undergraduates are, the more receptively they study and that the most mature are those whose parents stay at a safe distance. Not parents who are off the screen, but ones who put themselves discreetly into waiting, to deal with a crisis if one arises but otherwise to back off. </p> <p>But the admissions tutors are also, a touch shamefacedly, party to organising the burgeoning websites and parents' contact points that allow those parents who feel a need to keep in touch a way of doing so. </p> <p>The universities are in a dilemma. Not only do most of them feel that students would work better with less parental interference, but they are in a legal bind as well. Undergraduates are over 18, and are therefore legally adults. The parents have no legal right to know what is happening to them. The university has no power to tell, unless there is an emergency. It is something on which admissions tutors work at maintaining a balance. If Ma or Da rings in a dither because Student hasn't phoned home all week, tutor will point out that it can be a good thing. It can mean Student has settled well into this new life. </p> <p>What is happening, as the green card in my cupboard indicates, is a compromise. Parents are being invited in to look on open days at courses and at university accommodation. They are also given contact points and advice leaflets and websites to look at. But somewhere in the fine print of all that is being offered there is the message: back off, let your child mature. </p> <p>Other parents and teachers I have talked to come up with several answers. Properly, of course, parents need to have knowledge to help their would-be undergraduate make sensible decisions and also need to be sure there is proper back- up available if something goes wrong. </p> <p>On that score, all universities run welfare networks, including putting post- graduate students to live in halls as a point of contact and working with the students\u00bf union welfare officers and housing officers to look out for those who are failing to cope. </p> <p>But beyond that, the repeated parental refrain is: \"Well, I suppose that now we are expected to pay so much, we need to know that we are getting our money's worth.\" Parents always paid. In the days of grants, there was still an element of parental contribution. Even those on full grants mostly still had back-up. They were kept in the holidays. Their clothes were bought for them. Their books were bought. With undergraduates of traditional age, the 18- to 20-year-olds, most will be going away from home for the first time, and even those living at home will be going into a far more challenging academic environment in which they will need to be far more self-reliant. Parents will be involved, certainly financially and emotionally.</p> <p>However, what they need to be, for the welfare of their personal undergraduates, is involved, but not busybodies.</p>",
  "<p><strong>DJ Freeman would like to travel from Santiago, Chile to Quito, Equador, preferably by rail.</strong></p> <p>We spent six months in 2003 making our way up the Andes from Santiago. We planned to theme our travel around rail and festivals, but found that there are precious few railways in South America, so we took buses instead. These were an education in themselves and ranged from those with stewards, three-course meals and DVDs in Argentina, to buses full of dust with people sleeping in the aisles in Bolivia. We travelled on many overnight, because all the distances are huge compared to the UK and even the best scenery gets boring after six hours; and also because we saved a night's accomodation each time. </p> <p>The breathtaking bus route from Santiago to Mendoza in Argentina is one worth doing in the day. It follows a defunct narrow gauge line crossing the mountains beneath Aconcagua (highest Andean peak). There was no rail until far north-west Argentina, and the day trip on the Tren de las Nubes (train of the clouds) from the friendly city of Salta. The views become ever more spectacular until the track reaches snowfields, climbing to over 5,000m. The ticket only takes you to the highest point on the Chilean/Argentine border and then brings you back the way you came. (You can alight at the furthest point and negotiate with the Chilean freight train drivers to travel down the other side, but the trip involves freezing overnight in a coal wagon.) </p> <p>We bused from Salta up on to the high altiplano of Bolivia. Here you can take a train from Tupiza (where Butch Cassidy was shot down) to Ururo through red desert landscapes and past salt flats full of James flamingos. This is a good alternative to touring the Salar de Uyuni for four days in a jeep - the only other way to see the wilds. </p> <p>The next train to be found is in Puno, on Lake Titicaca. We travelled there on more buses, taking in Bolivia's capital La Paz. A train runs from Puno to the Quecha Indian city of Cusco - unmissable not least because it's the best place from which to visit Machu Picchu. If you do the typical four-day Inca trail, the journey back to Cusco will be by vintage rail, or you could just take this lovely shiny blue locomotive down the Sacred Valley there and back again. </p> <p>Another train on the same line runs from nearby Juliaca down to Arequipa, the white mesizto city in the far south of Peru. It has a beautiful climate and is overshadowed by three snowcapped volcanos. There are no trains then for the length of the Peruvian Andes, and flying to destinations will save a huge amounts of time, since every road into the peaks is only B-road size and winds around an endless succession of hairpin bends until you are heartily sick of the views swinging back and forth through 180 degrees. </p> <p>There are only three train journeys available in Ecuador: the spectacular Devil's Nose from Riobamba to Sibambe and back, a weekend excursion from Quito to the El Boliche station near Parque Nacional Cotopaxi and a 45km ride out of Ibarra. The first is the most famous, and follows a small part of the Andes up towards Quito. You can sit on the roof of this train, but hang on tight and wear enough clothes to combat the early morning chill. </p> <p>None of the train journeys mentioned above run frequently - Tren de las Nubes just runs twice a month and the Bolivian routes a couple of times a week. <br><strong>Kate Shanahan</strong></p> <p>To travel from Quito to Santiago by rail is simply not possible. Going by bus, though, will permit you to take almost any route you fancy. <br><strong>J-C Gumucio-Castellon</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sarah Shaw wants to travel to Libya independently and wants to know how to get the required 'invitation' to visit the country. </strong></p> <p>The Libyan People's Bureau (embassy) in London (020-7589 6120) recommends Libyan Tours, a Libyan agency based in London (020-8748 9898, Brittania House, 1-11 Glenthorne Road, Hammersmith, W6). Libyan Tours works with several travel companies in Tripoli, including Robban Tours, Arkno Tours, Wings Travel, Iram Tours and Fezzan Tours (the last two specialise in desert tours). You could try contacting one of these companies direct, but they will only issue the required invitation to travel to groups of three or more, so it is better to go through the agency in London which can apply on behalf of groups - although this does not mean you have to travel with other people, simply that the agency applies for the invitation on behalf of several people at once. Libyan Tours will also arrange for your passport to be translated into Arabic (another requirement). The whole process costs \u00a380 and takes about a week. <br><strong>Joanne Salt</strong> </p> <p><strong>This week's questions</strong></p> <p> I will be in Koh Samui over Christmas.

  "<p>Next month sees the opening of the first W hotel in Canada. But the design-conscious chain hasn't, as you might expect, opted for the biggest Canadian city, Toronto, to make its mark. Instead, they've chosen Montreal, the hip and culturally dynamic Quebecois city long sold to visiting Americans as a little bit of Europe without the jetlag. </p> <p>Montreal - the second largest French-speaking city in the world after Paris - can do that version of itself in its sleep. But there's another, more alluring, side to the city: youthful, vibrant and rich in creative talent, especially in fashion, film, media, and the visual arts. This is reflected in the strong growth of the boutique hotel sector in recent years, of which the W hotel is merely the latest entrant. </p> <p>Information on the traditional sights is available from Tourism Montreal (see Way to go below), but to access the stylish side of the city that the guidebooks have yet to catch up with, here are some recommendations. </p> <p>As soon as you arrive in Montreal, get hold of a copy of Design Guide Montreal, a free booklet distributed widely across the city. It's an invaluable area-by-area guide to award-winning design, with recommendations for bars, restaurants, shops and hotels. </p> <p>With this in hand, plus a few ice-breaking French phrases, you'll experience a rather more dynamic Montreal than those tourists clip-clopping along on the city's ubiquitous horse-drawn carriages. And with the Canadian dollar still in the doldrums, you'll be able to enjoy a stylish stay without breaking the bank. </p> <p><strong> Hippest hotels</strong><br> </p> <p> Behind a 19th-century facade, <strong>Hotel Gault</strong> (449 rue Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, +514 904 1616, <a href=\"http://www.hotelgault.com\">hotelgault.com</a>; doubles from C$229) features vast loft-style rooms with polished concrete floors, natural wood and blissfully little adornment. Bathrooms come with heated floors and freestanding double tubs; thoughtful extras include complimentary bowls of caf\u00e9 au lait delivered to your door each morning. Staff are hip yet affable - for all the minimalism of the decor, this is an impressively relaxed place. </p> <p>If you like your hotels on the icy side of cool in their design, you'll love <strong> St Paul Hotel</strong> (355 rue McGill, +514 380 2222, <a href=\"http://www.hotelstpaul.com\">hotelstpaul.com</a>; doubles from C$215). In the shell of a 1900 Beaux Arts building, this C$15 million project incorporates elements of water, air, earth and the sky in its design, and never stints on drama: in the lobby, a wall of alabaster houses a flickering fire. Much favoured by the fashion crowd. </p> <p>In what was once a dour 60s office block downtown, <strong> Hotel Le Germain</strong> (2050 rue Mansfield, +514 849 2050, <a href=\"http://www.hotelgermain.com\">hotelgermain.com</a>; doubles from C$210) is now a sensual treat. Features include a window from the bedroom into the shower-room (there are shutters for modest souls); furniture by local designers, and Aveda toiletries. Best views are from rooms ending in 03 on each floor. </p> <p>The <strong> W</strong> (901 Victoria Square, +514 282 4585, <a href=\"http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels\">starwoodhotels.com/whotels</a>; doubles from C$519) is housed in the former Bank of Canada building in the newly developed Cite International district. Designed to be foxy and funky in equal measure, the W also has a sense of humour (the eight suites are graded into Wow and Extreme Wow categories). The massive Living Room lobby includes (count them) three 12-foot high waterfalls; stylish rooms feature \"voyeur showers\" with just a curtain for privacy, and the hotel's facilities include a spa and restaurant serving Italian-led fusion dishes. </p> <p>So far, so what you might expect from boutique hotels: varying degrees of design-conscious minimalism. The year-old <strong>Hotel Nelligan</strong> (106 rue St-Paul Ouest, +514 788 2040, <a href=\"http://www.hotelnelligan.com\">hotelnelligan.com</a>; doubles from C$190), named after 19th-century Quebecois poet Emile Nelligan, is different. Rather like the UK Hotel du Vin chain, the emphasis here is on comfy modern luxury, with only an unthreatening nod to contemporary design - all rooms have spacious bathrooms, Frette bathrobes, and CD players. There's a great rooftop terrace for summer drinks with a view, plus a rated French restaurant, Verses. </p> <p>Most forcefully bucking the minimalist boutique trend is the <strong> St James</strong> (355 rue St-Jacques, + 514 841 3111, <a href=\"http://www.hotellestjames.com\">hotellestjames.com</a>; doubles from C$400) - an unabashed shrine to decadent overstatement. Formerly the Mercantile Bank of Canada, its antique-filled rooms are the A-list choice (The Rolling Stones booked the whole hotel for a week last time they played here). Lavish doesn't really cover it; if this hotel were a person, it would be Elton John at his most flamboyant. </p> <p><strong> Hottest tables</strong><br> </p> <p> Normand Laprise, the chef at <strong> Toque!</strong> (900 Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle, +514 499 2084, <a href=\"http://www.restaurant-toque.com\">restaurant-toque.com</a>) is a Montreal celebrity, and his restaurant is widely regarded as the city's best. Expect inventive French-tinged cook ing, audacious combinations of zingingly fresh ingredients, and faultless service from young, friendly staff. Book well ahead. </p> <p>The staff at <strong> Cube</strong> (355 rue McGill, +514 876 2823) look like supermodels, but don't let that put you off. A breathtakingly stylish space, Cube serves subtle fusion dishes to Montreal's beautiful people and visiting stars. Catherine Deneuve, Robert De Niro and Bono have dined here; the U2 front man liked it so much, he invited the entire staff to the band's gig. </p> <p>More arty than starry, <strong> Art-Bar Cluny</strong> (257 rue Prince, +514 866 1213) offers a modern take on refectory-style dining in the Darling Foundry, a cutting-edge visual arts centre in Old Montreal. Prices are keen, and portions are large in this atmospheric venue, derelict until a couple of years ago. </p> <p>Two of the best veggie options are <strong> Chu Chai</strong> (4088 rue Saint-Denis, +514 843 4194) a largely vegan, Thai restaurant, and next door, <strong> Chuch</strong> - the same owners and pretty much the same food, but this one is an immaculate BYOB canteen. </p> <p>For its delicious coffee, pastries, gourmet sandwiches and salads, <strong> Olive &amp; Gourmondo</strong> (351 rue St-Paul Ouest, +514 350 1083, <a href=\"http://www.oliveetgourmando.com\">oliveetgourmando.com</a>) is the best bakery and caf\u00e9 in town. Takeout is available, too. </p> <p><strong> Coolest drinks</strong><br> </p> <p> There are so many good bars in the city, and the best are so busy, it's tempting to think Montrealers never stay home. Head to particularly fruitful streets and districts, and take your pick: Boulevard Saint-Laurent buzzes with style bars; rue St-Paul in Old Montreal encompasses stylish options between more touristy venues, and rue Crescent, downtown, is lined with possibilities. </p> <p> <strong> Skala </strong> (295 rue St-Paul Est, +514 871 2847) is an atmospheric bar-restaurant with a great garden for drinks after dark, with sofas, candles, fine tunes played loud, and roses growing against concrete. <strong> Newtown</strong> (1476 rue Crescent, +514 284 6555, <a href=\"http://www.newtown.ca\">newtown.ca</a>) is a trendy bar, club, and restaurant complex owned by Jacques Villeneuve. Head for the roof terrace in the summer, and the heaving club in winter. Further along rue Crescent, at 1219, is the microbrewery <strong> Brutopia</strong> (+514 393 9277), a relaxed shrine to the intoxicating pleasures of beer. </p> <p> <strong> Exos II</strong> (361 rue Emery, +514 842 3967; exos.ca) is the place to drink ... water. A smoke-free water bar, with its own water cellar, Exos also offers beauty treatments and massage. If this appeals, then check out <strong> O2 Oasis Oxygen Bar </strong> (4059 Saint-Laurent, +514 284 1196, <a href=\"http://www.oasisoxygene.com\">oasisoxygene.com</a>) where 10 minutes of oxygen in a lush chill-out zone costs CD$7. </p> <p>Go people watching in the Plateau, the formerly working-class (and now boho-trendy) district made famous by local playwright Michel Tremblay. <strong> Les Folies</strong> (701, ave. du Mont-Royal Est, +514 528 4343) is the perfect spot: a retro-futurist interior and small terrace at street level. Good all-day venue for coffee, brunch, juices, and cocktails. </p> <p><strong> Designer shopping</strong><br> </p> <p> A big city with designer stores - no surprise there, then. But what makes shopping in Montreal's coolest stores a pleasure is that it doesn't come with attitude. In the following places, staff were uniformly welcoming and unsnooty. </p> <p> <strong> Kamkyl Urban Atelier</strong> (439 rue Saint-Pierre, +514 281 8221, <a href=\"http://www.kamkyl.com\">kamkyl.com</a>) is the brainchild of locally based duo Yvonne and Douglas (ex-Hugo Boss) Mandel: high-end, droolingly lovely menswear in an astonishing post-industrial space. <strong> U&amp;I </strong> (3650 Saint-Laurent, +514 844 8788, <a href=\"http://www.boutiqueuandi.com\">boutiqueuandi.com</a>) is a wonderfully friendly place showcasing local designs for both men and women. Featured designers include Denis Gagnon and Yso; great footwear and accessories, too. </p> <p> <strong> Dubuc mode de vie </strong> (4451 rue Saint-Denis; +514 282 1465) offers urban sophistication for men and women from Montreal designer, and rising star, Philippe Dubuc, while <strong> Interversion </strong> (4273 Saint-Laurent, +514 284 2103, <a href=\"http://www.interversion.com\">interversion.com</a>) is a must-visit designer homeware shop. It was one of the city's first when it opened in 1988, and while others swoon over Italian and Scandinavian designs, Interversion doggedly promotes work by Quebecois talents. </p> <p> <strong> Espace Pepin </strong> (350 rue Saint-Paul Ouest, +541 844 0114, <a href=\"http://www.pepinart.com\">pepinart.com</a>) is an eclectic funky outlet offering love-or-hate-them erotic female nudes by artist Lysanne Pepin, plus cool homeware, distinctive clothing and kooky accessories. Many lines are locally designed. </p> <p><strong>Way to go:</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> BA (0870 8509850, <a href=\"http://www.ba.com\"> ba.com</a>) flies to Montreal from Heathrow from \u00a3387.80 return, inc taxes. </p> <p><strong>Further information:</strong> Tourism Montreal (+514 844 5400, tourism-montreal.org).

  "<p>'Because it's there\" was only part of the story. I was as interested in making the journey with our 13-year-old daughter as I was in climbing the mountain. When we asked, Meg said that what she wanted to do this summer was go to Tanzania and see monkeys. What she got was a pact with me that I would show her monkeys . . . if she would climb Mount Kilimanjaro. </p> <p>\"You'll want to do some altitude training,\" said my sister who climbed it three years ago. </p> <p>\"OK.\" </p> <p>The next morning we set off for Alexandra Palace. At 331ft above sea level it's not exactly \"altitude\", but you have to work with what you've got and what we had was the streets of north London. Next, we did Hampstead Heath, stopping at each of its 700-odd benches to do five \"step ups\". We walked the five miles to Oxford Street to \"get gear\" - headlamps, sleeping bags, water bottles - and then we walked home again. One week before we left we \"did\" the Thames towpath from Richmond to Putney in just over two hours. The next day we cycled from Richmond to Highgate in about the same time. We decided we were in good shape. </p> <p>But, privately, I wondered. After each training session, I would ask Meg how she felt. \"Good,\" she invariably replied. No stiffness? \"No.\" Creaks or twinges? \"None.\" Blisters? \"Nope.\" </p> <p>Which was all very well because I was creaking all over. </p> <p>\"My legs are as long as yours, but I weigh half as much,\" said Meg as if that accounted for everything. </p> <p>At 5,895 metres (19,340ft) Kilimanjaro is the world's highest freestanding mountain. It is also the most easily accessible of the world's major peaks. \"Anyone\" - that well-known person - can climb it, if they're reasonably fit. </p> <p>But, just in case, I had inveigled my brother, Dave, to join us from Cape Town. </p> <p>\"It'll be fun,\" I said. </p> <p>\"For whom?\" he replied. </p> <p>\"Me,\" said Meg. </p> <p>At the hotel in Arusha, in the shadow of Kilimanjaro, we met Jonas Rutta, who was to be our guide. He stressed the need to drink a huge amount of fluids - five litres each per day was the prescribed volume. The first shock came with the scale of the operation. There were only the three of us in our party. Plus two guides. Plus 16 porters. </p> <p>\"Sixteen?\" I asked, unsure that I had heard correctly. </p> <p>Jonas nodded. \"They carry food, water, tents, cooking equipment. Most companies have a ratio of five or six porters for every hiker.\" </p> <p>\"I see no problem,\" said Meg happily. </p> <p>But the next morning we did. We were climbing the Machame Route, which is a longer and - at least in one sense - more arduous route than the Marangu or (so some call it) \"Coca Cola Route\". Machame is more strenuous in the sense that you walk further, but it is \"better\" in the sense that you spend more time at altitude and therefore have more time to acclimatise and to prepare for the final ascent. From the Machame Gate that day, 106 hikers set off to climb the mountain, which is to say about 700 people in total. That's an enormous pressure for one small path to take. Admittedly, July and August are \"dry season\", which is to say \"high season\" and so this was peak volume - but still, 700 people per day, per gate? </p> <p>\"This is going to be horrible,\" I muttered to Dave. </p> <p>But he is a botanist and was already buried in conversation with Remmy (our junior guide) about the distribution of various species of plant. The first day's hike, in which we climbed from 1,800 to 3,000 metres above sea level, was spent entirely under the canopy of the dense forest. Here majestic camphor trees soared 30 or 40 metres into the sky, while beneath them we and a panoply of lesser plants struggled for light, air and life. </p> <p>Dave spent a long time photographing the wild strangler figs while Meg peered between the branches looking for monkeys. They were there, Remmy assured her, but they were tired of being photographed. Perhaps she should call their agent? He was sure something could be worked out. </p> <p>Slow but steady is the way on Kilimanjaro. The first day took us easily to 3,000m, but on the second day, as we ramped up through the gears to the Shira campsite (at 3,840m), it became a case of slow but unsteady. First Dave and then I succumbed to headaches and mild dizziness. \"Altitude\" was Jonas's instant diagnosis, although I was inclined to blame the sun as well. It had been a scorching hot and dry day. In either case the prescription was the same: drink water, drink water, drink water. And if that fails, drink some more water. Only Meg was unaffected. </p> <p>\"It's probably age,\" she mused. </p> <p>We tribal elders drank water and retired early, while Meg read her book late into the night. </p> <p>Day three - another perfect blue sky framed the still mountain. Dave, however, was still a little woozy. \"Drink water,\" Jonas advised with a smile. \"Today we're going up to four-seven.\" Four seven being, for those in the know, 4,700m above sea level. Dave's headache, however, persisted and it was only the prospect of investigating the Senecio johnstonii and giant Lobelia deckenii that kept him going. Jonas revealed a deep knowledge of these plants and he and Dave were getting on well. \"See how the lobelia closes at night,\" he told Meg. \"But by day it opens up to the sun.\" </p> <p>\"Like Dave,\" said Meg kindly. Dave looked like he was open only to the suggestion that we head back down to sea level where, he had decided, he belonged. </p> <p>And still we climbed. Four-one. Four-three. Four-six. At 4,700m, we stopped for lunch. I felt OK. Meg looked un- troubled by anything except the slightly greenish tinge to the mushroom soup. And Dave looked wrecked. The sight of a group of porters playing an impromptu game of football did not help. </p> <p>This ascent to four-seven was all part of the acclimatisation and we spent the afternoon dropping back down to Barranco Camp at 3,950m, a descent that considerably improved Dave's outlook on life. Almost as much as did the discovery of predator droppings. \"Wild dogs,\" said Jonas, but Dave, who has worked for many years in South Africa's game reserves, knew leopard scat when he saw it. </p> <p>\"Well, that was the easy part,\" said Remmy. \"Tomorrow we do the hard stuff. Drink lots of water.\" </p> <p>We drank lots of water and fell asleep. </p> <p>The hard stuff started just like the \"easy\" stuff. A long, slow column heading out of the valley into an instantly brutal ascent. Followed by some more ascent. And some more. It was another hot, cloudless, pitiless (but, thank goodness, mud-less) kind of day. By now the vegetation had given way to the alpine desert. Dave spent some time sniffing lichens and mosses, discussing hanging lichen or usnea with Remmy. It's known colloquially as \"old man's beard\". </p> <p>\"Like your father, no?\" Remmy remarked, to Meg's delight. It had been a while since I had shaved. </p> <p>And then the ascent started again. It was 4pm before we reached Barafu, the final camp before the peak. In the last hour Dave dropped back, going slower and slower. </p> <p>\"Now you must drink,\" said Jonas as we made camp. \"And you must eat. And you must sleep. At midnight we start.\" </p> <p>Eleven o'clock came and Meg and I rose in grim silence. Dave couldn't get up. The altitude had got him. We agreed he would wait for us while we made the ascent and came back down. Around us, the survivors from the 106 who started were making similar decisions. Perhaps 70 began the final pilgrimage to the top. </p> <p>It was a strange sight. The full moon shone brightly and few of us had to use the headlamps we carried. Instead, this bleak, funereal procession of dark figures against a blackened landscape wound slowly up the path. From time to time, there would be the click of a boot or pole on rock. From time to time, someone slipped. But mostly we walked in silence, alone with our thoughts and the constricting absence of oxygen. Every 40 minutes or so we climbed another 100 metres. Four-six became four-seven. Four-seven gave way, grudgingly, to four-eight. Just before the magical \"five\" - still 900m short of the peak - the first people turned back. Soon after, a second party gave up. </p> <p>Meg and I moved on in silence, Jonas ahead of us, Remmy behind. At about this point we lost all interest in the mountain and its barren moonlit beauty. All that mattered was the next, interminable step. And the next. And the one after that - only that seemed too far away to think about. </p> <p>And then it was all over. Somewhere over five-one, we packed it in, unable - or unwilling - to take another step. </p> <p>\"It's not that I can't take a step,\" Meg protested tearfully. \"I can walk OK; I just can't walk up.\" We embraced in silence. </p> <p>\"Then let's go find some monkeys,\" I said. </p> <p>Remmy looked disappointed. A heated exchange followed between him and Jonas before they agreed that Remmy should continue. \"He needs the ascents,\" Jonas explained, \"to become a senior guide.\" Like Jonas, Remmy had started off as a porter. As with Jonas, it was his command of English that allowed him to rise to his current status as a guide. </p> <p>\"I'll take your camera,\" he said. \"Just because you don't get there doesn't mean you can't have the photo.\" And so while he climbed, we dropped, grateful for the oxygen and the release. Grateful at dawn to crawl into our bags for a couple of hours of precious sleep. Remmy caught up with us at about 9am and we spent the next four hours completing our descent. We were 200m short of the Mweka gates when he dropped to one knee. Beckoning to Meg he pointed through the camphor trees to where a patch of sunlight caught the branches of a mahogany tree. There, chattering on the branches, was a troop of black and white colobus monkeys. </p> <p>\"It's why I came,\" said Meg happily. \"How about you?\" </p> <p><strong>Kili, dad and me</strong></p> <p>Sitting on the right-hand side of the plane in order to get a 'good view' of the mountain, we looked out of the window. Flying at 16,000ft, we were looking down on a peak just above the cloud line. 'It looks do-able,' Dad said, not knowing it was the wrong mountain. 'And if you all turn to your left,' the captain's voice crackled over the loudspeaker, 'you will see Kilimanjaro.' Instead of looking down, we looked up. Three thousand feet above us, 'Kili' was covered in ice. 'Wow...' was all I managed to say. 'So whose idea was this?' Dad said. I wasn't laughing. </p> <p>The first few days went smoothly. Altitude sickness missed me, making it a lot more enjoyable. My Uncle Dave seemed to suffer most. 'All part of acclimatising,' Jonas, our guide, told us. Unfortunately, 'de-gassing' was too! You got used to passing pockets of smelly air, where the groups ahead of us had, as Dad delicately put it, 'cut the cheese'. </p> <p>Not making it to the top was disappointing, but at the time seemed like a very good idea. '5,100 metres. We've only been walking three hours,' Jonas sighed. I could tell Dad was glad to be going down. </p> <p>Instead of taking two days for the rest of the journey down, we decided to take one. The sooner we were off the mountain, the better. In the end, the eight-hour descent took us four. At the pace we were going, we were catching up with the porters! We took one last look at the mountain, before it disappeared into the clouds. 'Maybe next year,' Dad said. I was too tired to answer. <br><strong>Meg Falck, age 13 </strong></p> <p><strong>How to get there</strong></p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> Departing September 25, KE Adventure Travel (017687 73966,<a href=\"http://www.keadventure.com\"> keadventure.com</a>) offers a nine-day trek to Kilimanjaro on the Rongai Route from \u00a31,240.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday August 28 2004</strong> </p> <p>We mistakenly said that Steven Reynolds of The Stagg Inn, Titley, was formerly at Shepherd's Inn at Amesbury when he was in fact at the Riverside Inn at Aymestrey, Herefordshire.</p> <p></p> <p> <strong>Telephone:</strong> 01544 230221. <br><strong>Address:</strong> Titley, Kington, Herefordshire.<br><strong>Open:</strong> Tues-Sat, 12noon-3pm, 6.30-11pm; Sun, 12noon-3pm. <br><strong>Rating:</strong> 16.5/20 </p> <p>'I'll have the pigeon breast with fig and port sauce,\" said Mr Hill, \"and then the rack of Marches lamb with sweetbreads and new potatoes.\" </p> <p>I stared aghast. That had been my own choice, exactly, both dishes. The cad. \"Oh, well. Um, Ah. Yes. Well. Hang on. Oh, hang it. Trout tartare and saddle of venison with Jerusalem artichoke dauphinoise, shallots and red wine. Please. And a bottle of Les Pavillions de ...\" </p> <p>\"Mr Hill usually has the Stagg's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, does he.\" </p> <p>\"Damn fine wine,\" said Mr Hill. </p> <p>\"Well, we'd better have it,\" I said. </p> <p>I was reminded forcibly of the definition a friend of mine once gave of his influence within his family - \"I will be master in my own house. I will not come out from underneath the table.\" I would like to put down Mr Hill's hijacking of the command role to the easy-drinking pint of Reverend James beer he had tipped down his throat earlier, but I suspect that he is always like that. He knows his mind when it comes to food and drink. And to many other matters, too, come to that. </p> <p>It was a Thursday lunchtime in the Stagg Inn in Titley, near Kington, which is near ... Well, where is Kington near - Brecon? Ross-on-Wye? Hay-on-Wye? Anyway, somewhere down one of those leafy, swervy lanes in bosky Herefordshire. </p> <p>The Stagg Inn gained a good deal of publicity a couple of years back when it became the first gastropub to be awarded a Michelin star. This was seen as rather radical at the time, although several more have since emulated this achievement. Actually, it makes sense when you think about it. They are, or can be, the restaurants de famille de nos jours et de notre pays , which have long been Michelin material in its native France. And that's what the Stagg Inn is, the personal fiefdom of Nicola and Steven Reynolds. </p> <p>Mr Hill reminded me that I had come across Mr Reynolds's fine, robust, confident cooking before. He used to be at the even more remote Shepherd's Inn at Amesbury in Shropshire, which I reviewed with some enthusiasm several years ago. </p> <p>The Stagg Inn itself is a rather more substantial place, with a fine, cream-painted brick frontage, a bit of a garden, a proper bar serving proper beer, a dining area and a dining room, all offering different opportunities to eat, and all with a handsome plainness to them. It hasn't been tarted up, titivated, or otherwise traduced. Oh, and there is no music. </p> <p>The food, too, is handsome. And plain? Well, it rather depends on how you define it. Certainly more effort is expended on getting the quality of the base ingredients right rather than on plate fancywork. The pigeon breasts were wild and from the woods round about. The lamb from the hills. The beef from the fields. The venison from - where did the venison come from? Oh, yes, it was farmed just up the road. And they are all very fine. </p> <p>To be honest, I have forsworn eating any trout but wild brown trout within no more than a couple of hours of being caught, preferably by me. However, the organically farmed trout in the tartare had an unusual degree of firmness and almost cressy freshness about it, and mixed with chips of nicely crunchy cucumber made for as light, delicate and elegant a summer dish as you could wish for. </p> <p>Mr Hill's pigeon was the antithesis, what with the dusky richness of the bosom, the sweet richness of the port and the squidgy richness of the fruit, but there was a fine layering of flavours crafted to a slavering plateful. </p> <p>\"Taste that,\" said Mr Hill, shoving a nugget of something at me. \"He knows how to cook a sweetbread.\" Indeed, Mr Reynolds does. It was crunchy outside and creamy inside. The lamb, too, had been cooked so that its natural qualities were shown off to effect, the fine grain of the meat, and its rather grave, clear, clean full flavour. </p> <p>There isn't much point in doing anything fancy with such stuff, but it takes far more intelligence to leave well alone than it does to doll it up. On that basis, I conclude that Mr Reynolds is an intelligent chef. There was not much more to the plate than a fine gravy and a few nutty new potatoes. No wonder that, following a brief snickering of knife and fork, all that remained was a pile of bones picked clean of all meat. </p> <p>Moreover - not a word you often come across in restaurant reviews - the creamy opulence of the Jerusalem artichoke dauphinoise was a wonderful foil to the honky-tonk wildness of the venison, with enough concentration of the red wine sauce to cut both. It wasn't fancy, but it was savvy. </p> <p>We had cheeses, all of which were locally produced and in excellent nick, and then a righteous, refreshing summer fruit millefeuille for me and a downright unrighteous, refreshing passionfruit tart with mango ice cream for him. The bill for the two of us was \u00a359.40, not including liquid items, which were another matter that Mr Hill took care of. Well, he's such a forceful presence.</p>",
  "<p>Santiago Pozo is a man with a mission. He is also a man living his own version of the American dream. When he arrived in LA from Spain he had a few dollars in his pocket and an idea in his head: to create a Spanish-language film studio to rival the English-language dominance of Hollywood. And where better to do it than in Hollywood. </p> <p>\"I started alone with a telephone in my house in Studio City,\" he told the Spanish-language paper La Opini\u00f3n this week. \"Then we moved to Sunset Boulevard, then Hollywood Boulevard, and now we are in Beverly Hills.\" Pozo, like many in the film world, is a man with a sharp understanding of the anthropological niceties of LA. </p> <p>This week his company, Arenas Entertainment, releases a film with the catchy Spanglish title of Nicotina - La Vida Unfiltered. A huge hit in its native Mexico, the film tries to ride the wave of other Mexican hits, including Amores Perros and Y tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, films which moved beyond cult success to win mainstream acclaim.. </p> <p>But where those films found international success thanks to the might of established CHK Hollywood players such as Miramax, Nicotina is being distributed by the little-known Arenas Entertainment. </p> <p>\"Nicotina represents the first time that a Latin distributor in the US is releasing a new Mexican film on 120 screens, a figure that will probably rise to 500,\" said Pozo. \"And that means that for the first time we're not dependent on an Anglo-Saxon company accepting or not accepting the film in order to be able to show it in the US.\" </p> <p>\"The marketing is pretty much in Spanglish,\" says John Murphy, who works on the film's PR. \"It touches on cultural icons in most Latino homes.\" </p> <p>In looking to exploit a market equally at ease in Spanish and English, the team behind Nicotina echo an innovative strategy quietly unveiled a month ago by Burger King. </p> <p>The fast-food chain, something of a leader in tailoring its message to reach specific ethnic groups, revealed research showing that many second-generation Latinos were more receptive to adverts aimed at them in English not Spanish. So its exotically titled department of diversity and multicultural marketing developed an English-language campaign aimed at Latinos. </p> <p>\"There are two different groups,\" says Cirabel Olson, the department's director. The first he said were still learning English, but the second \"are more acculturated, are usually bilingual, often second generation, and may or may not be watching Spanish-language TV. We made a conscious decision to target them.\" </p> <p>The message that the Latino community has its own clout is not lost on politicians: both main presidential candidates are running Spanish-language ads in the potential swing states of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida and Nevada. </p> <p>Jorge Ramos notes in his book The Latin Wave - How Hispanics Will Elect the Next President of the United States, forget Ralph Nader, it was probably the Cuban-American community in Florida, seduced by George Bush's lavish spending on Spanish-language TV ads, that won the state for him in the 2000 election. </p> <p>For Pozo, the attention, for whatever reason, is more than welcome. </p> <p>\"It makes me very proud that there is a Latin company here in the heart of Beverly Hills because there's a racist idea at work - many people think that we're operating out of a garage in Pacoima [the fruit-growing area of the San Fernando valley].\"</p>",
  "<p>The Fell pony, one of the UK's rarest semi-wild breeds, will slide towards extinction unless its importance in preserving the character of Britain's uplands is recognised and breeders are given support, the government will be told in a report. </p> <p>David Murray, an independent consultant, says the ancient breed is crucial to maintaining the character of the Lake District, as changes to agriculture policy mean there will be fewer sheep in the hills, which need grazing animals to allow rare wild plants to thrive. </p> <p>He will draw the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' attention to the ponies' plight. </p> <p>An international geographers' conference in Glasgow heard that there are only 246 breeding mares registered, most of them living in the mountains of Cumbria. </p> <p>Unlike farm animals, the Fell ponies attract no subsidy or support. They have lived in Britain's uplands for thousands of years, but their numbers are dwindling. </p> <p>The breed is one of nine descended from the pre-historic horse Tarpan which are still living in Britain. The others, including the New Forest, Dartmoor and Shetland breeds, are better known. </p> <p>Fell ponies live between 200 and 750 metres (650-2,500ft) above sea level, and are exceptionally hardy. They are able to survive in temperatures of -20C (-4F), and lose up to a third of their body weight in winter. </p> <p>Although they are privately owned, the ponies roam the hills in small herds and are semi-wild, keeping clear of people where possible. Of the 24 herds, 20 are in Cumbria, with others in Northumberland, Morayshire and Perthshire. </p> <p>Mr Murray said: \"There is no incentive to keep these animals but for that fact that the farmers are enthusiasts, but they are getting older and there is no one to replace them. These ponies are not just a part of our heritage, they also have a vital future role in keeping the fells as we want them to be.\" </p> <p>He said the old system of paying hill farmers according to the number of sheep and cattle on their land had been abolished in January. This was expected to lead to a dramatic decrease in grazing stock on the hills, which could change the appearance of the landscape as bigger grasses and scrub took over. </p> <p>A study of the ponies' eating habits showed that they ignored wild flowers and heather, but ate the rough grasses and the bark of shrubs - exactly the kind of management the hills need. </p> <p>Mr Murray's report, commissioned by Defra and supported by English Nature, will call for legislation to protect the Fell pony and funding to allow the breed to survive. </p> <p>The ponies are remnants of a much larger population used in the 19th century to haul coal, carry milkmen and deliver post to outlying farms. Domestic versions are used for riding and trekking, but it is the semi-wild herds in the hills Mr Murray believes should be protected for the sake of the landscape. </p> <p>He is doing a second study for the Brecon Beacons national park into another pony variety, the Welsh Mountain pony, which is also semi-wild. Although it is less threatened it is still in decline for similar reasons. </p> <p>\"All these ponies, apart from being important as part of our distinctive regional heritage, are part of a proper form of land management for the uplands,\" he said. \"We need to look after them, value them, and bring them back in sufficient numbers to help keep the vegetation in a state so other wild creatures, plants and birds can thrive.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lake District scientists are trying to save Britain's rarest fish, the Vendace, which only lives in two lakes, Bassenthwaite and Derwent Water. </p> <p>The fish, a relict of the ice age, has stopped breeding in Bassenthwaite because the shoreline gravel in which it lays its eggs has been smothered in sediment washed down from the hills and river banks. Scientists want trees planted on the bank to catch the sediment, and changes to grazing practices on the fells.</p>",
  "<p>Kelly Sotherton showed nerves of steel in the long jump as she reinforced her claim for an Olympic silver medal in the heptathlon. </p> <p>There was no such glory for defending champion Denise Lewis, however, as the 31-year-old's chances of a third Olympic medal now look slim. Lying in second place when heptathlon competition resumed this morning, 27-year-old Sotherton was facing heartbreak when she no-jumped the first two of her three efforts in her specialist event. </p> <p>Sotherton, who hails from the Isle of Wight but now competes for Birchfield Harriers, came into these Games fearing she might crack under the pressure of her first Olympics, and for a while it looked as if her worst nightmare was going to become a reality. </p> <p>Then, on her third and final jump, Sotherton shrugged off the pressure and produced a superb leap under the circumstances as she notched 6.51m for 1010 points, the second best performance in the event behind gold medal favourite Carolina Kluft.</p> <p>Lewis' best leap was 5.89m and she dropped from ninth overall in the heptathlon to 18th with just the javelin and 800m to come tonight. Swedish sensation Kluft, the 21-year-old world champion, is certain to take Lewis' Olympic title as she led the field after the morning session on 5208 points. Sotherton was next on 4879, but 176 ahead of third place. Lewis has it all to do as the long jump left her 199 behind the bronze medal position. </p> <p>Meanwhile Christine Ohuruogu led the way with another personal best as Britain's three 400 metre runners made it through to tomorrow's semi-finals. The 20-year-old Londoner, who won the AAA Championships last month, finished third in the sixth and final heat in 50.50 seconds, shaving 0.39 of a second off her previous best time. </p> <p>Drawn in lane seven, Ohuruogu went off fast as she chased Tiandra Ponteen in the lane outside her and was in fourth position coming off the final bend. She then made it look easy as she stepped up a gear in the final 50m to pass Ponteen and make sure of the third automatic qualifying spot. </p> <p>\"It's fantastic,\" said Ohuruogu. \"I am very happy because I ran the race how I wanted to and I wasn't nervous. I have a prayer I say before every race that calms me down and I thought: 'I have come so far, whatever happens'. I went to a church service last night and that eased my mind. </p> <p>\"When I stepped out and saw the crowd I thought 'wow' and the last time that happened it was at Crystal Palace when I messed up, so I had to make sure I kept myself under control this time. I hope I can make the final now, I still have to sort out the first 200m but I have got another crack at it - I am just relieved that is over.\" </p> <p>Team-mates Lee McConnell and Donna Fraser also looked comfortable as they finished second in their heats in identical times. McConnell, who clocked 51.19 in the opening heat behind gold medal favourite Ana Guevara of Mexico, said her race went according to plan. </p> <p>\"I am glad to get it out of the way,\" said the 25-year-old Scot. \"Ever since I got to Athens I have been desperate to get started. It was very warm, they had us out there for a bit longer than I would have hoped but it was fine. I wanted to finish second behind Ana and I did that so I am happy.\" </p> <p>Fraser, who after three years dogged by an Achilles injury would love to emulate her fourth place in Sydney four years ago, ran also ran 51.19 in heat three and then revealed she was still carrying one or two problems. </p> <p>\"Leading up to these Games has been ridiculous,\" said the 31-year-old Londoner. \"My good Achilles has gone bad and the bad one has gone good. The left one was the bad one and I think the right one must have got jealous. </p> <p>\"It is a bit sore now but I can deal with it. I know enough about Achilles injuries after three years and it will be fine.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere on the second day of athletics in the Olympic Stadium, it had been a tall order to expect Emeka Udechuku to make the 12-man discus final and so it proved. The 25-year-old's best throw of 58.41 saw him drop out of the competition at the qualifying stage.</p>",
  "<p>The best ingredients do not always make for the best drinks. Take cr\u00e8me de cassis, for example, the sweet blackcurrant flavoured liqueur. (I believe that it is customary for anyone who has been to France over the summer to have brought a bottle back. If so, they may well be wondering what to do with it.) </p> <p>Most people add it to champagne or at the very least sparkling wine, to make kir royale. However, a plain kir made with a dash of cr\u00e8me de cassis and still white wine is a far superior drink. It is the perfect aperitif not just in the leftover heat at the tail-end of summer, but also in dankest winter. </p> <p>On a freezing winter's evening when we walk into a sweltering French brasserie and my husband's glasses steam up in an embarrassing fashion, sending him blundering into other people's tables, kir is the drink that you'll find me ordering before settling down to my favourite meal of roquefort salad followed by pork cooked in cider. </p> <p>Surprisingly, the drink only recently acquired its name, in honour of Canon Felix Kir (though he did not invent it), who was elected mayor of Dijon in honour of his work as a resistance fighter during the second world war. Bourgogne aligote is traditionally the wine used in its creation, although anything dry and not too overpowering will do (do avoid any sweaty, overwhelming, heavily oaked New World numbers). I tend to stick to French wines - I quite enjoy the slightly raw liveliness of a sauvignon blanc from Touraine; at the impeccably glamorous Bibendum oyster bar, they use a sauvignon blanc from C\u00f4tes du Tarn. </p> <p>Having established that a good kir does not rely on spending too much on the wine, a similar reduction should also be applied to the amount of liqueur you slosh in. Less is more in this case, so that you should be able to taste the wine, allowing for merely a veil of the sweet blackcurrant. </p> <p>You don't want the cr\u00e8me de cassis to lurk in the cupboard for too long (12 months is probably the limit for storage), so to ensure there is no wastage, try incorporating it into a longer, refreshing concoction. For example, add one measure to another of vodka and a generous squeeze of lemon. Top with soda and stir with a sprig of mint. </p> <p>Cr\u00e8me de cassis also comes in handy in the kitchen: as a livener in a summer pudding; for giving added depth to the fruit flavour of homemade blackcurrant ripple ice cream; or, my favourite, for deglazing the pan after frying duck breasts, reducing the liquid a little until you have a very fine sauce to pour over the rich meat.</p>",
  "<p>There are a number of stock things grown adults tend to regret. Most wish they had carried on playing a musical instrument. A good few spend endless hours on Friends Reunited, wistfully rolling their mouse over schoolday crushes they never had the guts to pursue. Almost all - and this might sound like a dangerously sweeping statement, but honestly, it's true - wish that they could speak another language at least half decently.</p> <p>That's why evening classes are chock-full with stuttering grown-ups muddling through elementary Italian; and why the Costa Brava is overflowing with ex-pat Brits living cheek-by-jowl in English-speaking ghettos, too afraid to mingle with the locals.</p> <p>So save yourself the indelicacy and frustration of being a middle-aged monoglot and bite the bullet. Universities offer all manner of language courses, from Spanish to Sanskrit, many of which go into Clearing and all of which are ripe for the picking.</p> <p>Almost all degrees with a foreign language component take four years instead of the usual three because of the compulsory year abroad. In Scotland, where standard undergraduate degrees last for four years anyway, it either takes four as normal (eg at Edinburgh University) or a fairly hefty half decade (eg at Glasgow University). An increasing majority of students plump for combination or joint degrees, teaming one language either with another, or with another, totally unrelated subject.</p> <p>But why study languages when you could be toiling away over mathematic equations, breaking your brain trying to remember legalese or gnawing your nails over medical vivas? Well, it's obvious. Quite apart from becoming the envy of all your monolingual mates, having languages at your fingertips opens doors. It might not be the definitive key to a lucrative and fulfilling career, but it'll oil the joints on the way there.</p> <p>My first paid assignment for this newspaper came as a direct result of my language skills. While on my year abroad from university in Berlin, I found myself tangled up in a student demonstration that had catastrophic ramifications for the whole German higher education system. Uber-keen ears pricked up at a potential exclusive, I spontaneously interviewed marchers, academics and students (in German), pitched a piece to the newsdesk and landed myself with a tidy 1,000-word commission, to be delivered the next day. One year on, and recently graduated, I am now a professional journalist.</p> <p>Another thing you should bear in mind: no matter how good your intentions, you simply will not be able to keep up your language skills post-A-level (or indeed post-GCSE) without topping them up with either regular periods working or living abroad, or by studying languages.</p> <p>For some language graduates there isn't one specific, eureka moment where it all makes sense, but rather a general sense of horizons opening gradually as a result of being fluent in another tongue. </p> <p>Olaf Furniss graduated with a degree in translation from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. Since gaining the necessary letters after his name, he has used his language skills in all kinds of jobs, including being an international adviser to various music events and to the editor of an international music industry magazine. He reckons that doing languages is definitely worth it - if only for the fabulous compulsory year abroad.</p> <p>\"I spent most of my year in Mexico, which totally changed the course of my life,\" he says. \"It was massively enlightening; I did a stint on the Mexico City Times and I can honestly say the work I did there was probably the stuff I'm most proud of writing ever.\" He adds: \"I certainly think I'm more employable because of my language skills, but unfortunately because in this country we are so monolingual, you don't always get credit for it.\"</p> <p>Language skills do, unfortunately, tend to be underrated, or even berated. Often being linguistically gifted isn't a means to an end, but rather a helpful bonus on the way to getting to where you want to be. The UK is now so short of language teachers that it is offering a \u00a34,000 \"golden hello\" to any PCGE-toting graduates who go on to teach these priority subjects. That is in addition to the \u00a36,000 tax-free training bursary available to most trainees on any postgraduate initial teacher training course. </p> <p>Vicky Smith, 22, graduated this year with a joint degree in French, German and European studies from Bath University. She's currently weighing up whether to become a teacher, lured in no small part by the cash incentive. Not that becoming a teacher was foremost on her mind: \"I fought against it,\" she admits. \"I was so sick of people with no imagination saying 'oh, you do languages, do you want to be a teacher, then?' that I was determined to do something else.</p> <p>\"But then I did a teaching assistantship on my year abroad in Saarland and realised that I loved the human contact that came with teaching. It was so satisfying. It was only when I found myself filling in job applications to become a translator that I suddenly realised that I wanted to do something active, something varied, that allowed me to use my languages.\" </p> <p>Christopher Harte graduated in 2000 with a degree in modern European languages from Durham University. He was in the first batch of new teachers greeted with the \u00a34,000 hello. Now, still only 26, he has recently won the Teacher Training Agency award for outstanding new teacher in the north-east, in the regional Teaching Awards, for his work as a French and Spanish teacher at St Robert of Newminster school in Sunderland. \"At a university like Durham lots of people go straight into management consultancy, accountancy and such, but I wanted to go in a different direction,\" he says, pointing to his year abroad as a teaching assistant in a Marseille Lyc\u00e9e as catalyst for this decision.</p> <p>\"I wanted human interaction, and I find teaching so rewarding. It was when my first set of results came through that I realised how much I enjoy the job, when kids who I knew would normally get Ds came out with Cs.\" </p> <p>Francesca Martin graduated last year with a degree in French and Russian from Nottingham University and recently landed herself a job working for a bank in Switzerland. \"Without my languages I would never have got here,\" she says. \"Languages open doors which might otherwise be closed.\"</p> <p>Language ability really can give you a competitive edge, a well earned leg-up in the crowded global economy. Linguistic talent can really be the clincher in the war for eye-catching CVs, as employment agencies such as Euro London, which is where Francesca nabbed her job, can no doubt testify. What's more, by connecting with other cultures you cannot help but improve your inter-personal people skills, while building on your analytic and interpretive capabilities.</p> <p>Plus you will be doing your bit to counteract the negative impression many of our neighbours have of our fair isle. Stereotypes stick, after all. If you really want to get ahead in the big bad world of Life, Careers and Stuff, you can't go far wrong studying one of the trickier languages such as Chinese, Japanese or Arabic. Fancy yourself as a spy? Well, MI6 are always on the lookout for bright graduates, and linguistic proficiency in the so-called difficult languages is certainly a positive. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office says: \"It would certainly be to a candidate's advantage to show the ability to learn a difficult language, such as Arabic, Hindu, Chinese, Russian or Pushtu [which is the primary language spoken in Afghanistan]. There's this false impression of the British secret services being dominated by white, Oxbridge-educated males, but we're looking for people from a much wider background - especially those who have grown up speaking a different language at home.\" So there is really no excuse not to run the language gauntlet. Then when you're old and grey you can sing along knowingly to \"je ne regrette rien\" - and, if you have a French degree, you'll even understand the grammar.<br> </p> <p><strong>Case study</strong></p> <p><strong>\"You have to choose a subject you like</strong><br></p> <p>Robert Benson (pictured), 21, is studying languages with professional studies at Leeds Metropolitan University<br></p> <p>\"I was predicted two Bs and a C for my A-levels, but I didn't work very hard. I didn't enjoy them and dropped out for a couple of weeks, but got talked into going back by my parents and my French teacher. I was convinced I was going to get three Us, but I ended up with two Es and a D. I was disappointed but at least I had three A-levels. At one point I thought I was going to get nothing out of the two years.</p> <p>I phoned Manchester Met, who said I could do French as long as I started straight away. I wasn't ready to do that - I wanted to have a year out working and travelling with friends. After a bit of persuasion, and with the help of a reference from my French teacher, Leeds Met said they would take me after my gap year.</p> <p>French is the only thing I was really good at at school. Everyone had told me it was important to choose a subject you enjoyed, so I chose French along with beginner's Spanish. I'm also doing marketing.</p> <p>I'd say I'm doing OK: my head is above water. I need to be a bit more organised. There are only about 20 people on my language course, so I know my tutors on a very personal level. It's really good because I can talk to them about any problems. I'm very fortunate.</p> <p>The only downside is that each semester we do a module in marketing, which is part of the professional studies course, and the module isn't linked to the language you're studying. It means language students are treated as normal professional studies students, which can be quite difficult. The highlight for me has been when a group of French students came over from Dijon for a couple of months on an exchange. Every week for an hour we chatted with them: half an hour in English and half an hour in French. I've just finished my second year and I'm starting to get to grips with Spanish. I'm spending next year in France, going to university in Lyon and staying in halls there. There are four of us going. It's very exciting. I can continue learning Spanish while I'm there, which I'm really pleased about.</p> <p>I'm not sure exactly what I want to do when I leave, but I'd like to work in a multinational company.:<br> <strong>Interview by Katie Shimmon</strong><br></p>",
  "<p><strong> The Weekenders: Adventures in Calcutta</strong><br> edited by Andrew O'Hagan<br> 301pp, Ebury Press, \u00a37.99</p> <p> Let me get this out of the way first: I am one of those people to whom Bella Bathurst refers in \"The Nightfishing\", the essay that opens this collection of writing on Kolkata. I \"speak of the city in the tones of a parent with a beloved but intransigent child, complaining that if only Kolkata could get over its filthy habits, its wastrel lifestyle and its penchant for gambling with all it should hold precious, it just might salvage something of its greatness\". This is the city in which I was born; it is where I now live; and it is where, barring longish stints on the other side of the world, I have spent most of my adult life. </p> <p>A city, if you have lived long enough in it, bleeds into you just as much as you bleed into the city. In an anthemic song from his album Tomake Chai (\"It's You I Want\"), the popular contemporary Bengali singer Suman Chattopadhyay describes this process: \"The first day I went to school, the first time I flunked, / The first holiday I ever took on a train from Howrah station / This city has recorded all my firsts / It catches up with me the more I try and escape it\" (my translation). That is how it is with me. And so, the sight of The Weekenders, in which, according to the blurb, 11 writers \"experience a mystical and compelling city like no other on Earth\", made me slightly distrustful of what lay between the covers. Oh no, not another one of those. </p> <p>It is easy to be suspicious of a book that purports to have a group of writers trying to \"uncover the beating heart of a city\". It is easy to mock the endeavour (while admiring its aim - the proceeds of the book go to charity) because any such exercise has its pitfalls: the risk of factual inaccuracy (and there are a few in this book), the danger of pat conclusions (and there are a few), the hazard of sweeping generalisation tantamount to distortion (yes, there are those, too). </p> <p>But that is not what I remember - or, frankly, want to remember - from this collection. It is remarkable for its fine writing; it is worth reading because, like the city it talks about, it flirts with stereotypes and eventually defies them; and because it looks for and frequently finds the contradictory pulls (old money versus new enterprise; Marx versus market economics; crumbling mansions versus gleaming glass facades of IT hubs) that tug at the heart of the Kolkata of today. </p> <p>In his introduction Andrew O'Hagan sets the agenda (and makes me pine for the inclusion of a piece from him): \"From the Bengali to the Colonial, from the art-song to the cinema: the city is a matrix of remembered narratives jostling for air and space.\" He calls The Weekenders \"a travelogue and a thriller, a tone poem and a colour chart\". Few books live up to such claims. This one does. </p> <p>Nearly every writer manages to find his/her own story amid the larger, evolving narrative of the city. Nearly everyone comes away with insights that are as fresh as they are illuminating. Bathurst finds in Kolkata echoes of Glasgow or Liverpool (\"once-great industrial and manufacturing cities with huge and literate migrant populations, working rivers and superiority complexes\"); Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn undertakes an extraordinary journey to anatomise the quality of mercy as exemplified by the city and its best-known do-gooder, Mother Teresa, and her Missionaries of Charity; in her compelling, unadorned, poignant story, Monica Ali talks about Deepak, a lost boy who \"works\" the carriages of trains that steam into Howrah station; Victoria Glendinning, in a bleak but hope-filled story set in the city's red-light area, calls it an \"all or nothing place\"; and Sam Miller, after a ride on the underground (as clean and uncluttered as he remembered it from 15 years ago) and a look at the shopping malls and amusement parks, asks if \"Kolkata is in the process of becoming everywhere else\".</p> <p>But it isn't. Not really. Because Kolkata, despite its removal from the centre to the margin of India's polity and progress, despite its resigned acceptance of its dwindled status, despite its pretensions of intellectual superiority, has one thing that no other Indian city that I know has: it seems to possess a unique dignity, a life-affirming quality that is all its own. </p> <p>\"But just as everything decays, so also it finds another role,\" writes Bathurst. \"One life is never one life, but a potentially infinite set of reincarnations.\" This collection is a joy to read because it taps into the sense of boundless possibilities that Kolkata exemplifies.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Soumya Bhattacharya is deputy editor of the Hindustan Times in Kolkata.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture</strong><br>810pp, Phaidon, \u00a3100</p> <p>A real atlas of what is being built in the world today would be a confounding thing - a Domesday Book of cheapness, pretension and making do. This vast Phaidon atlas is something different: a gazetteer of all that is most inventive, inspiring and humane in the architecture of the past five years. Itself beautifully and thoughtfully designed, it leaves one with a heady reassurance that architecture, so essential and ubiquitous, and often so banal, is still at its best a transforming medium, giving meaning as it gives delight.</p> <p>The atlas circles the globe, from the deserts of Western Australia to the vineyards of southern Chile, taking in 1,052 buildings on the way. Each is given at least half a page, most a full page, and a spectacular few (such as Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Hall in LA or Future Systems' groovy Birmingham Selfridges) are awarded a two-page spread. Each receives a succinct write-up: some of these a little stiff with theory; others, it must be said, based almost verbatim on promotional literature put out by the architects themselves. Anonymity prevails (the book doesn't even admit to an editor), and the brief preface describes the process but not the principles of selection. There is a certain inscrutability, therefore, about the project, despite its openness and inquisitiveness.</p> <p>Overall the book is a celebration, and it is only rarely that a building is even admitted to be controversial. The judgments are made tacitly, by omission, so that Michael Hopkins's new Westminster tube station gets in, but not his hugely conspicuous Portcullis House above it - the space going instead to a bandstand in Bexhill-on-Sea. Many of the buildings covered are astoundingly big, but the charm of the book lies in its insistence on imagination over mere self-assertion, so that as well as visiting the stupendous Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur (1,483 feet high), we spend quality time in a Dutch bus shelter and a sauna in Duluth. Two of the most appealing buildings are public lavatories, one fitted into the old fabric of Dubrovnik, the other a piece of radical \"springtecture\" by Shuhei Endo, an uncoiling twirl of corrugated aluminium half-buried in a Japanese hillside.</p> <p>It is an interesting game to open the book at random and see if you can tell from the pictures which country, or even which continent, a building exists in. Now and then there's a palm tree or glacier to help, and in certain places, such as India or Norway, landscape and building traditions combine to produce something distinctly indigenous. But in general you come to see that the atlas is justly named, and that world architecture really exists. It is not, like world music, a folk-based phenomenon. On the contrary, it is part of the long declension of high modernism, and it is an orthodoxy that is genuinely global. The same language of forms and (since the history of architecture is intimate with the history of technology) the same materials recur across the world.</p> <p>If the modernist box remains the default form, unsurpassable for its elegance and adaptability, it has also been the spur to some amazingly bold escapes from that orthodoxy. Ten or 15 years ago, this would have been a very different book, full of the referential jokiness of postmodernism. Few styles can have dated so quickly or so comprehensively. Here it is remembered only occasionally - as in Venturi Scott Brown's Toulouse Capitol Building, with its vestigial pediments and porticos.</p> <p>It has been succeeded by something more radical in its wit. Gehry continues to design in monumental free-form curves, using every angle except a right one. In his building for a management school in Cleveland, Ohio, writhing stainless-steel-clad forms erupt from a square redbrick block, which buckles and melts beneath them. In his waterfront development in D\u00fcsseldorf, the warped forms themselves resemble reflections in water, the 1,600 windows all skewed at different angles. In London the once formidably cuboidal Norman Foster has designed two beautiful buildings, the Swiss Re tower and City Hall, entirely out of curves; they combine advanced ecological programming with a formal elan one could not have predicted 10 years ago. City Hall's great spiral ramp, which leans back on its curving axis as it rises from basement to roof, has the sublimity and spacial daring of a late baroque master such as Borromini.</p> <p>The materials employed are wonderful to list. On the one hand there are new ones such as ETFE (ethyltetrafluorethylene), of which the geodesic domes of Nicholas Grimshaw's Eden Project are made, and which has less than 1% of the mass of glass, making possible a structure of unprecedented lightness. The airy daring of many large buildings by Foster, Calatrava and others depends on the novel engineering possibilities of lightweight tubular steel. In Frankfurt, Grimshaw has built the largest pillarless span in Europe, under a magnificent roof of conch-like undulations.</p> <p>More unconventional materials are used for smaller-scale projects: that Dutch bus-shelter is made of polystyrene foam and polyester. A more superficial novelty comes from claddings of pixelated graphic panels or the digitally printed laminate that covers a huge French gym in photographed (but not for a moment convincing) ivy. In Holland - where even functional buildings are treated with an imaginative boldness bordering on eccentricity - there is a heat transfer station with a polyurethane-clad \"climbing wall\" which spells out in braille \"The Blind Fa\u00e7ade\", and a \"Popcentrum\" with walls of glass mineral wool clad in black rubber.</p> <p>But there is another trend, in many parts of the world, towards the use of cheap, found and recycled materials. In Alabama the Rural School builds community projects on minimal budgets: an assembly hall out of rammed earth and old car windscreens; a house whose pretty, parti-coloured walls turn out to be made from stacks of carpet tiles. In Holland there's a pavilion of semi-translucent beer-crates. In Westcliff-on-Sea an after-school club is Europe's first cardboard building, made of 90% recycled materials and itself almost totally recyclable. Often these usages are inventive responses to necessity, but they have their own aesthetic. Sarah Wigglesworth's Straw Bale House in London has walls of bales and sandbags as sound insulation and also as a kind of ongoing bricolage, the improvisation of a house that is permanently incomplete.</p> <p>Political and economic currents run through the atlas, creating new vortices of activity and floods of expenditure. So Berlin takes on the functions of a capital, with its new embassies and new Reichstag (another Foster spiral); in Ljubljana such functions are combined with colourful attempts to undo the ravages of socialist modernism; in the Far East magnificent new airports are designed (so globalised is the profession) by Foster (Hong Kong), Terry Farrell (Seoul) and Paul Andreu (Shanghai). SOM's 88-storey Jin Mao tower in Shanghai, with its pagoda-like silhouette, is a vision of economic boom in the language of a fantasy book illustration.</p> <p>In this context there's not a lot about the re-use of old buildings, beyond a handful of museums and some striking Viennese gasometers turned into chic if noisy flats. But it's good to see attention given to the challenging work of the Beirut architect Bernard Khoury. He has designed a series of restaurants and nightclubs amid the dereliction and random commercial redevelopment of that city. \"Beirut is not being rebuilt,\" he says, and indeed only one Beirut building other than his is included in the atlas. Khoury's sumptuously hi-tech works - a restaurant inside an old warehouse shored up by a steel exoskeleton, a jazz club sunk in the site of a refugee settlement wiped out by Phalangist militia in 1976 - are disconcertingly ironic statements about the glamour and denial of pleasure-seeking. They remind us, too, of the loneliness of good architecture in a violent and fiercely commercial world.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alan Hollinghurst's novel The Line of Beauty is published by Picador</p>",
  "<p>I'm just packing my bags for a summer holiday in Tuscany, but by the time I get there Tony Blair will have left the region, having travelled to Sardinia to spend a couple of days with Silvio Berlusconi amid his seven swimming pools (that's one more pool than would have been needed for every member of the Blair family to swim in solitude), and thence to I don't know where. </p> <p>It is hard to keep up with the prime minister's summer movements, since he likes to pack in as many freebies as he can. This hopping about in aeroplanes can't be much fun for Leo, who would presumably prefer to stay in one place with his bucket and spade. But the little fellow has no choice in the matter, for his father has his status to maintain as an international jetsetter with lots of glamorous and important friends. </p> <p>Blair's summer holidays have been a matter of obsessional media interest ever since, as the new leader of the opposition, he spent his first Tuscan holiday at the house near San Gimignano of the Labour millionaire and future cabinet minister Geoffrey Robinson. This raised a few eyebrows even then among those who thought that Labour leaders should have more modest holiday aspirations, but it turned out to be only Blair's first step up the social ladder. </p> <p>When Robinson's business affairs made him too controversial a figure to be allowed to have him to stay, Blair spent his next holiday nearby in a much larger villa with a much grander host - Prince Girolamo Guicciardini Strozzi, Prince of Forlano, Duke of Bagnolo, Conte Palatino, etc, etc. </p> <p>After this, the prime minister had become so addicted to posh foreign sponging and so indifferent to the impression it might create at home that even the great nobleman was worried. Prince Strozzi said publicly in 2001 that he thought it would be wiser politically for Blair to stay in England during the foot-and-mouth crisis than to be his guest in Tuscany, and the prime minister duly complied. </p> <p>But, as soon as he could, he was off sponging again - next time on a former Italian royal estate on the sea near Pisa, courtesy of the president of the Tuscan region to which the estate now belongs. The fawning regional government did the prime minister no favours by having the villa redecorated especially for him at the local taxpayers' expense and closing down a public beach so that the Blairs could enjoy it in privacy. </p> <p>The Tuscans, who had initially been flattered by Blair's choice of their region for his holidays, then started to turn against him and even complained that the sum of money he paid to an Italian children's charity to curry favour with them was stingy and far smaller than what it would have cost him to rent such a villa himself. </p> <p>Then came Iraq, and the Blairs started taking their summer holidays on the other side of the world - in Mexico and Barbados in Sir Cliff Richard's house. The prime minister, who had once promised to put Britain back at the heart of Europe, had become so unpopular on the continent because of his slavish attachment to President Bush over Iraq that he perhaps felt he wouldn't be welcome there any more. </p> <p>But Iraq, while putting Blair's relations with Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder under great strain, made him a new best buddy in the frightful Berlusconi, a fellow Iraq hawk. So he has come back to Europe, but to that small, despised faction of it that worships at the feet of George Bush. </p> <p>To have accepted the hospitality of Berlusconi, a rightwing entrepreneur of immense wealth, questionable business practices and anti-constitutional tendencies, who is furthermore currently under attack for messing up his bit of Sardinian coastline, seemed a recklessly provocative decision. Its arrogance takes the breath away. </p> <p>If Blair has got away with it, it is because few voters in Britain really know or care who Berlusconi is. They probably think of him as someone out of a comic opera with no connection to reality. By staying with him in Sardinia, the prime minister may seem to have indulged a harmless fantasy. </p> <p>But the Labour party should know better. It shouldn't just grumble inaudibly. It should recognise that its leader has become a comic-opera figure himself and rise in revolt. In fact, he's worse than that. </p> <p>His outrageous decision to stay with Berlusconi was beyond mere snobbery and self-indulgence. It was a kick in the teeth for the Labour party and a show of contempt for everything it has ever stood for.</p>",
  "<p>When an advertising agency lands the account of an automobile manufacturer, tension in the office must be akin to that of an over-wound banjo string. Account executives will be torn between euphoria in anticipation of the glamorous locations, swimwear models and award-winning graphics which will go along with flogging their new client's sports cars, and soggy-suited terror at the possibility of being lumbered with the commercials for the family cars that make a virtue of the product's stolid mundanity.</p> <p>The rules are clear: sports cars mean dancing horses, bikini-clad babes and vistas of winding roads in snow-upholstered Alps; family cars mean portly dads in cardigans pootling down drizzle-lashed A-roads to Ikea. It is forgiveable, then, that the poor sap who was saddled with Vauxhall's new brat-haulers, the Meriva and Zafira, attempted to enliven his assignment by throwing a soup\u00e7on of Freaky Friday-style comedy into the mix. With the aid of two children who look and speak remarkably like Ron Dixon from Brookside, we are beckoned through the looking-glass into a world where 10 year-olds are burdened with the weariness of suburban fathers. They conduct, with faintly discomfiting accuracy, one of those overly self-mocking conversations in which mortgaged, mediocre, middle-aged men try earnestly - and always unconvincingly - to enthuse about their drab, utilitarian people-carriers as if they wouldn't swap them in a heartbeat, along with their ghastly offspring, for a Ferrari with Scarlett Johansson parked in the passenger seat.</p> <p>This is painfully poignant when mortgaged, mediocre, middle-aged men do it. From the mouths of children, it's all but unbearable. Most car ads - the ones with the dancing horses, barely dressed hotties and Alps - are ridiculous, but at least they permit the viewer dreams of a life less ordinary. With these powerfully depressing ads, Vauxhall are telling people too young and innocent to know better that the Meriva and the Zafira - and the back seat full of howling, ice cream-smeared, incontinent hellions - are all they're ever likely to get.</p>",

  "<p>On the floor in a corner of my study, sticking out from under a pile of other papers, is a shabby old green folder containing a manuscript I believe will tell me a lot about my father and my own past. But ever since it was discovered I have been glancing at it, looking away, getting on with something else, thinking about it, doing nothing. The manuscript was given to me a few weeks ago. It is a novel written by my father, a legacy of words, a protracted will, perhaps - I don't know yet what it contains, only that it is called An Indian Adolescence. My father, who was a civil servant in the Pakistan embassy in London, wrote novels, stories and plays all his adult life. I think he completed at least four novels, all turned down by numerous publishers and agents, which was traumatic for our family, who took the rejection personally. But Dad did publish journalism about Pakistan, and about squash and cricket, and wrote two books on Pakistan for young people. </p> <p>I am sure An Indian Adolescence was his last novel, written, I guess, after his heart surgery, a bypass, when he was no longer employed in the embassy, where he'd worked most of his adult life. I have little idea what to expect from Dad's novel, but anticipate being shocked, moved and disturbed. Will it be dreadful, a masterpiece, or something in between? Will it tell me a little, too much, or just the right amount? </p> <p>I am wary of forgetting the conditions under which my father wrote. He was ill for most of my adolescence: in hospital, recuperating, about to go back to work, or getting ill again. His father was an army doctor who wanted his sons and daughters to train as doctors. Oddly, none did; though Dad got to spend a lot of time with doctors, as well as with - via the local library - Zen masters and Buddhists, and literary \"soul-doctors\" like Jung and Alan Watts. </p> <p>In place of a discarded Islam, Dad - a Muslim who had left India in his early 20s and never returned - made a religion at home out of library books, discontent and literary ambition. </p> <p>Bed is as good a place as any to write. I think my father wrote An Indian Adolescence lying down, with an old children's blackboard propped in front of him, writing paper clipped to it. When he felt better he'd type it up and carry the work to the post office; then we'd wait. For a while there'd be hope. </p> <p>The book was discovered by my agent a few months ago. I have no idea how long it had been in her office, but Father died nearly 11 years ago. After the age of 16, I didn't read any of his novels and didn't offer him my work to look at. His tough, somewhat sneering criticism was unbearable, and I found myself being too hard on him, too. I would see him getting hurt. </p> <p>It seems inevitable I will read his stories as personal truths. It annoys me to have my own work reduced to autobiography - often, writing isn't a reflection of experience so much as a substitute for it, an \"instead of\" rather than a \"reliving\". Still, whatever my father has made, I will be reconstructing him from these fragments, attempting to locate his \"self\" in these scatterings. Where else could you look? </p> <p>I begin reading. Eighty pages are missing in the middle. I ask my mother whether she has a copy. She doesn't. It'll be impossible, I guess, to find them. It is not only those pages that create the effect of an incomplete narrative. If I were my father's editor - which I am now, the two of us working together again as we did in the suburbs, me typing upstairs, him downstairs - I'd say the material isn't always coherently organised. Father seems to digress, then digress again, failing to return to his starting point, believing the reader will follow him. An Indian Adolescence reproduces the pattern of his mind. It just about holds together enough to be readable, and enjoyable. Father is immersing me in the India of his childhood - and my childhood, through the stories he told of the India he brought with him. </p> <p>Ishow the boys my father's manuscript and they talk about being a quarter Indian. They ask me if they're Muslim and put their arms next to mine, to compare colours. They like to declare their Indianness to the other children at school, most of whom are from \"elsewhere\". For my sons - one of whom wears a baseball cap the wrong way round, does hip-hop poses and makes up \"raps\" - it's a way of being \"in\" with the kids of colour and the whites, though these days there isn't much credit in being English. When my sons return from school they can sound Jamaican. \"Hush your mouth there, bwoy,\" they say. At other times they sound like Little Lord Fauntleroy. </p> <p>A few days after I began this exploration, something serendipitous occurred which opens another door. </p> <p>Of the 12 Kureishi children of my father's generation - most of whom lived in the house in Poona, where the family had their home before Partition - four are still alive: two sisters and my uncles Omar and Tootoo. Tootoo, who lives in Canada, emails me to say that Omar, living in a small flat in Karachi, has written two volumes of autobiography, Once Upon A Time and As Time Goes By. They are published, so far, only in Pakistan. They are \"bestsellers\". </p> <p>I ring Omar, whom I have not seen since the mid-1980s. His voice, once one of the best known in India and Pakistan on the radio, sounds reedy and thin. But he declares himself happy to be alive and working, wonders how long he has to live, and sends his books to me. Once Upon A Time covers the period my father is writing about. On the jacket is an Indian boy, a beach, Bombay's Gateway to India and the British, Indian and Pakistani flags. The jacket of the second includes reviews of the first, one of which says, \"One salutes Omar Kureishi for telling his story exceptionally well and without any apologies. The oracle has spoken.\" It occurs to me that Omar might be \"Mahmood\" in my father's novel, and I wonder what it is he wants to say about this brother. </p> <p>Some sort of search is beginning. I guess you don't really go looking for your parents until middle age. For me, this has become a quest, for my place in Father's history and fantasy, and for the reasons my father lived the semi-broken life he did. As a boy with one sister and a mother who is an only child, I was fascinated by Dad's large family, by the cricket teams, the swimming, the companionship. A number of my close male friendships have been attempts to recreate what I imagined was a \"brotherhood\". </p> <p>In An Indian Adolescence, I find disturbing a furious envy of Omar. Dad seems very competitive with his brother, but there's something about competing he can't bear. I wonder if this is \"the wound\" he seemed to be nursing when I was a child, the feeling of defeat and inferiority he tried to overcome by becoming a writer, and by having me become one. </p> <p>My parents met in 1952. Mother was living with her parents in the suburbs, working as a painter for a local potter. Dad had started at the embassy, in Knightsbridge, and was living in a bedsit in Wood Green, north London. I know Dad played cricket when he first came to England, after Partition when the rest of the family moved to Pakistan. I remember photographs of him holding his bat up, being applauded on some local cricket ground. But I don't think my mother liked sitting in damp pavilions, or being a \"cricket widow\". She was never afraid to stand up for herself; she had, after all, married an Indian for which, presumably, she had received disapproval. </p> <p>In England, Dad began his own family or empire. At home he could be the father he wished he'd had - involved, attentive, guiding - rather than the remote figure he describes in An Indian Adolescence. His own father, Colonel Kureishi, gambled every day and talked of becoming a professional poker player. He played cards with Omar; Omar knew it was the one thing that cheered him up. But my father said it was self-destructive, the gambler wanted to lose. He didn't like me playing card games either. Risk wasn't his thing. </p> <p>Reading An Indian Adolescence, I am startled by my father's feeling of failure so early on. Certainly, he was good at cricket, better than Omar, a fact for which Omar gives him credit, writing, \"Bombay Gymkhana was a 'For Europeans Only' club. It was a great honour for us Indians to be allowed in its hallowed premises. The star of the team was my brother Shannoo. In one match he took eight wickets and the Evening News did a feature on him with the headline 'School Boy Who Bowls Googlies'. When the batsman was asked what happened, he said the ground shook.\" </p> <p>In the late 1950s and early 60s, in our little garden in the suburbs, my father spent a lot of time coaching me at cricket, teaching me the shots, throwing balls so I could practise. In my kitchen I can still \"do\" a googly and even a Chinaman (a left-handed googly). More than this, I remember arguments and the terrible humiliation he made me feel. I'd have hysterical crying fits, tantrums. Cricket bats would get smashed. </p> <p>The position of teacher is never unambiguous. At the very least, one person has the power and the other doesn't. Reading Father's book, I am becoming aware that, partly, I was being made to feel as he had felt. He might want me to be successful, as his father had required him to be, but he was afraid of me becoming too powerful or rivalrous. He didn't want me to turn into his brother, who was more talented and something of a show-off, a man who could bear being enviable. If I was to be a brother to Dad, I had to be the weak, little one, the role he'd had thrust on him. At the same time I had to be good company, and educable. </p> <p>I would practise cricket alone, in the back garden. Father fixed a cricket ball to a piece of string tied to an apple tree. Obediently, I would hit the ball with a broom handle, for hours and hours, after school and at weekends, in all weathers. I'd play games in my head, and would write down the scores of imaginary teams (\"Hunte, Sobers, Kanhai, Kureishi ...\") in a scorebook, while whispering an imaginary commentary to myself in Omar's locutions. (He was, by now, working as a cricket commentator for BBC radio.) </p> <p>Being alone in this way, making things up, might have prepared me for being a writer, for the solitary pleasures of creativity. None of it prepared me for the pace or spin of a real cricket ball, of which I was afraid, or for the competitiveness of an actual match. On the rare occasions when I did go out to play, at school or in the park, I was scared, useless and ashamed. </p> <p>Father persisted and would take me around cricket clubs in Kent, trying to get me a game, which he did, on occasions. Far from any bus stop there would be rotting pavilions that smelled of socks; there'd be big West Indian fast bowlers, cucumber sandwiches and milky tea. Dad would stand on the boundary, shouting encouragement, as I, usually freezing cold, struggled not to fail, attempting not to make him disappointed, knowing he could do better. </p> <p>I failed at cricket, deliberately I hope. But only I knew how big a failure it was. To everyone else, if I wasn't much good at it, what did it matter? But Father had gone to a lot of trouble to initiate me into this game, into this family ideal and passion, and, to do him a favour, I let him down. I see it still as my own foolish failure rather than as a father's unconscious contrivance. Although my sons and I are in the park most weekends, we never play or watch cricket. They don't even know the rules, or why cricket has been an important Indian and family sport. </p> <p>In An Indian Adolescence, my father doesn't mention his parents' alienation from one another until the latter part of the book, where it appears almost as an afterthought. Ten years is a long time for a couple not to speak. My father observed his parents' love, such as it was, as I observed his and my children do mine, wondering what it might be this couple were doing together and what they might want from each other. </p> <p>For a time my parents' life together was, for me, the whole world. I did see that they never seemed to give one another much pleasure - didn't seem to like being together - but the pain wasn't too intense, either. To make the marriage work, my parents divided the labour. My mother concentrated on my sister, and on her first love, watching TV. Like Father, Mother liked stories, soap operas in her case, which she watched every day. Father didn't want a woman he had to compete with other men for. He was left to concentrate on me. He seemed to want to play all the roles: father, mother, brother, lover, friend, leaving little room for anyone else. As a child, I would love to hang on his neck while he lifted me up; we would wrestle in the garden and race in the park, box and play badminton. Narcissistic, and with what I would describe as a \"Muslim gaudiness\", he was for ever fussing with his clothes, cufflinks, shoes, ties, colognes. He would shave in the morning, then shave again. He would iron his own shirts and clean his own shoes. He would spend ages powdering, dressing and worrying about his hair, which he always oiled. He loved mirrors and adored to be praised for his appearance. Then he would worry - because I wore an earring - about whether I was homosexual. </p> <p>Where Mother hid her body - it was private - Dad loved to be touched by me. He wasn't much interested in my body and its burgeoning instincts: he had to be the one having pleasure. When he bathed, he took me with him. In the tiny bathroom I would wash his back, caress his head with oil, walk on his back, massage his feet - an intimacy I adored, the child being made to feel privileged to fulfil what he knows should be the wife's role, and the father happily turned into the adored, pampered baby again. </p> <p>I did think, as I began to make my own sexual investigations, that what my parents had together wasn't something I wanted for myself. My own life with my own woman would be much better. There would be less routine and more excitement and unpredictability. That was the story I told myself. One of the shocks I felt, years later, when I split up with the mother of my twins, was due to the fact I believed I would live my parents' life. Any disruption would be too painfully destructive to bear. But the suburban ideal only worked if nobody wanted too much, or if their wants were only material. </p> <p>In 1958, when I was four, we moved into the house that would be my only family home. It was nothing like any of the houses my father had grown up in, and he never wanted to move again. He loved the suburbs; to insult them was to insult him. Dad never attempted to become an Englishman; that was impossible. But he did join in the English way of life. </p> <p>Extraordinarily, like the other men in the area, my father decided to take up DIY. Unlike the other men, my father had done nothing like this before. He would glue polystyrene tiles to ceilings, cut unevenly, so they never fitted; little bits of white polystyrene stuck to the curtains and carpets for months. Whether he was \"passing\", I didn't know; nor did he. What he did emerged as parody, making our lives seem ridiculous, as though there was no seriousness possible. </p> <p>Like me, Dad may have been a failure at school, but he took his reading seriously; he knew his way around literature, politics, sport. And, despite his determination to join in, Dad was always trying to find time to write, which would prove his singularity. His life was partly formed by his rejection by publishers. He sent his books out and they'd be returned; he'd rewrite them and they'd come back again. Hope; despair; renewal. Occasionally, Father would threaten to give up trying to be a writer. From his point of view, this would be a disaster, a kind of suicide. A couple of days later he'd be back at his desk with a new idea. </p> <p>I spend half a day in my basement, riffling through the damp boxes of my \"archive\". Among the manuscripts, letters and photographs, I discover another of my father's novels and a play, Grocer And Son. The novel, The Redundant Man, I remember leafing through in the early 1980s. Omar was on a binge in London and taking only ice cream and vodka, a combination I recommend. Reclining unshaven in bed in a darkened room in South Kensington, he was given a copy by Dad. \"It's about him,\" Omar said to me later, with some sadness. </p> <p>Dad worked on The Redundant Man for years. I can recall clumsily giving advice about it, and feeling bad after, for being hard on him, even as he blamed me for its failure to get published. \"But you are knowing all these damn people, yaar,\" he'd say. He put us on the same level: writers - almost brothers - together, neither more talented than the other. </p> <p>He seems to have written the novel before An Indian Adolescence, and it is different in tone and style. The latter is written from the point of view of a child in conflict with his parents, while the former is partly about a father in conflict with his children. </p> <p>Set during the Thatcher \"reorganisations\" of the early 1980s, when unemployment was high and the idea around which life in the suburbs was built - that people would have jobs for life - was breaking down, The Redundant Man concerns Yusef, a 50-year-old Pakistani man in a job not unlike my father's. When Yusef is made redundant, he feels he has been cruelly used. Although Dad himself was not made redundant - others around him were - it could easily have been a release he wished for. </p> <p>It is disconcerting to find yourself in someone else's book, and in my father's I am not a pretty sight, dripping with CND badges and chains. The son often does things like this: \"He ran his fingers through his long black hair, which was tied at the back with a pink ribbon.\" Certainly Father and I had many conflicts at this time. He hated my hair, my independence, my aggression towards him; I loathed his advice and his desire to humiliate me. At times I'd be speechless with rage, restraining myself, fearful my words would do him in. Eventually, I more or less shut up, saving myself for writing, ruining my social life. </p> <p>But not entirely, according to Dad. There is a delicious moment in The Redundant Man when the father enters the boy's bedroom to find a naked English girl lying on the bed, \"reading Private Eye\". In this scenario Father himself is, of course, a kind of private eye. I like to imagine him listening at my bedroom door, going in when I was out, opening drawers, reading notes and diaries, generally snooping, as I did in my parents' bedroom. The boy claims, plausibly enough, that he is \"drawing\" the girl. The father, with some kindness, blames \"England\". I can only be surprised at Dad's fantasy of life in my bedroom, for in my diary of the time, aged 20, I wrote, \"Couldn't make love to J yesterday, knowing Dad was downstairs. Anyway my potency is going.\" </p> <p>It was some years before that, aged 14 and having read a few long books, I decided to write one myself, to see if I had the stamina for such a task. I had become drawn to rash challenges, provided they were sanctioned by Dad. He must have recognised that I was having trouble at school, that I was in danger of disappearing into despair and failure. Writing was his thing, the desire he lived with, but by introducing me to it, he lifted my spirits and showed me a way out. </p> <p>I had in my room a desk, record player, radio and a heavy old typewriter that Father had somehow managed to carry home from the embassy. My diary says: \"The novel is the sad story of a Jamaican in this country, his two loves and racial problem. It is written in a modern, flowing style, appealing to all. I've tried to put the colour problem in perspective.\" When the novel, Run Hard Black Man, was finished, I didn't show it to my father. I had offered him other pieces of my writing, but his criticism was surprisingly brusque and discouraging. </p> <p>Fortunately, Omar was acquainted with a woman at a publishing house, Anthony Blond, whom I knew as Jean Genet's British publisher. Blond himself invited Dad and me to his office in Doughty Street, where Dickens had lived. I was in my school uniform; Dad took a day off work and urged me to ask them for a \u00a35 advance so we could afford a good lunch. Dad believed the highest form of critical appreciation was cash. Blond, I think, wanted to see whether I was really the age I claimed to be. Fortunately, he wasn't intending to publish my book, but thought I should continue to work on it. He introduced me to Jeremy Trafford, an upper-class editor in charge of the academic list. Trafford had been brought up in India and had worked in Pakistan. He had been a hippy and was an aspiring novelist. He lived in shabby, traffic-choked, Earls Court bedsit-land, full of Australians, tourists, whores, dealers, fags and chancers. </p> <p>Jeremy loaned me records and books, and guided me in my reading. At his parties, enthusiastically attended by queens and young men, eccentrics and female novelists such as Beryl Bainbridge, and at which people sang No\u00ebl Coward songs, declaimed poetry and behaved as they wished, I was shown off. My father, as Jeremy puts it, was \"puffed-up with pride\". </p> <p>On Sundays Jeremy would come to the family house and sit with me at my desk, going through the sentences in my manuscript, striking some out, complimenting others, talking about the words that worked and the ones that didn't. (Nietzsche calls the creation of all art \"rejecting, sifting, reforming, arranging\".) Jeremy would also write me long letters about the nature of fiction and what made it effective, about creating structure and character. Over all this my father was patient, but excluded. Such praise and attention wasn't something he had received himself. </p> <p>Dad said he liked my first novel, The Buddha Of Suburbia, but didn't think it as good as his stuff, which he considered \"deeper\". If he felt it was a disconcerting picture of himself, he didn't say anything. He had, as I know now, been working on portraits of his own father for years. Nevertheless, its success stimulated Dad to write harder. If I could do it, so could he. </p> <p>But my father was still sick. He seemed to have been sitting in the house in his pyjamas for years. He died of a heart attack in November 1991. He lay on the bed in Brompton hospital, his shirt off and his once magnificent body written on by illness, crisscrossed with scars from his numerous operations, his stomach bulging and soft, the chest hair white. His death was unexpected; we were always at the hospital with him; this was just another visit. But he was gone, and there I was, out on the street at five in the morning, gulping tranquillisers, without him for ever, and Mother saying, \"I just want him to come home.\" </p> <p>Even as he had lain in that familiar place, the hospital bed, thinking he would soon recover, he had been full of questions and projects and talk. He never stopped pestering me about what I was intending to do, as though without him I would die, too. </p> <p>I walked home to my flat, went to bed and stayed there. I was living alone, having recently broken up with my girlfriend. I had no children or reliable friends. I saw no one for four days. I had directed a film, London Kills Me, which was about to be released. It was about a bright but lost boy struggling to make a life. </p> <p>Most communities have public and familial rituals of mourning, which begin the process of detachment. We had no such thing. We didn't even know if Father had wanted a Muslim funeral. Looking at my diary for that period, it is mostly accounts of my drug and alcohol consumption - cocaine, amyl nitrate, ecstasy, alcohol, grass, as though I were trying to kill something, or bring something in myself to life: \"Violent fantasies; thoughts of suicide\"; \"I have never loathed myself like this before\"; \"On the edge mentally, thinking people have been sent in cars to kill me.\" </p> <p>It wasn't long after that I started going to the mosque. (My diary says, \"Drink and drugs all week, plus a visit to the mosque.\") I had visited one in Pakistan as a tourist, but had refused to accompany my cousins on their Friday visits. Father had talked about the childhood monotony of learning the Koran by rote, and of being hit with sticks by the Moulvis. </p> <p>I knew I had to remove my shoes, but otherwise had no idea what to do there: Dad had never shown me. I copied the others, finding I liked the men's faces: so many different races and types, together in the same place. It wasn't belief I was looking for but solidarity, to see if there was a Muslim part of me that existed apart from my father, if being part of this group could be significant, or therapeutic in any way. </p> <p>I didn't find music, stories or community, as I had in church as a child. I found ideology and fundamentalism, and young people holding extreme, irrational and violent views. I'd leave in a fury, feeling unclean, as though nothing had any value. </p> <p>My father, whose own father was westernised, often talked of feeling alienated in India, with its eccentric religions and superstitions. I couldn't lose myself here, either; I didn't want to. But if I separated the ideology and the individuals, if I could get to the person behind the hate, I could find stories. I began to work on The Black Album and the film of My Son The Fanatic. </p> <p>When my father was 50, I was 20 and left home. At 50, Father was still trying to create the life he imagined was ahead of him, if he got the words in the right order. I'd like to talk to him about it, and have often tried to write a story about a man who goes into a pub on his 50th birthday and runs into his father, who is also 50. The two would talk as equals for the first time, the son seeing the father as a man like him. The son would be gay, a theatrical producer, and the father going to meet a lover. I haven't been able to write a word of their dialogue; I can, though, see them walking away from one another at the end. </p> <p>Being 50 will be the hardest birthday I have had, mostly because I have grown fonder of the world the longer I've been in it. As I watch my own sons growing up, I think of my father and Omar together as children, playing sport, arguing over girls, talking about what they've read; and then with their lives lived out, while a son writes this, trying to bring everything together. </p> <p>Opening the green folder and reading, I discovered my father had been writing for years about what it was like to be unwanted, and to have a more talented and favoured elder sibling. Despite this obstruction and much discouragement, he wrote all his life, against the odds, refusing to stop speaking. I am glad I found these books; glad I read them. Father has at last received from me what he wanted when he sat down to write each morning: his stories have been pored over, lived with, become the subject of conversation. </p> <p>Among other things, this has been a story of generations, told through the males, from my grandfather, via my own father, his brothers, myself and my own sons, three British boys called Kureishi. The Colonel, from a military family, could seem like an authoritarian father. My own father was something of a 1960s dad, wanting to be his son's friend and companion, as well as to promote himself in the world through his son. And there is me, a later generation, quizzical, not knowing what a father is, what he should do, or even what a man is now. </p> <p>Father gave me what he wanted for himself, and it was a lot: for a start, the education he lacked. If I've been interested in anything, it came through what was in his head, along with daily visits to the library with my mother. Then, out of his attempted writing cure, the energy of his narrow commitment, I found my own stories to tell. I cannot overestimate what a pleasure the writing life has been and how it has sustained me. It was where I started from and where I'm still going. Being a storyteller, making a living by my pen, getting the children through - Father would have considered it a decent way to live, an achievement, built on a family history of which he was part. </p> <p>Now, as always, I sit alone in the room. It's OK, warm, safe, controlled; beyond, there are no maps; Dad made all the maps, they belong to him, and he's taken them with him. Beyond it's chaos, wild, unknown, and that's the only place to go, to head for. </p> <p>I slip Dad's manuscript back into its green folder, place it under a pile of papers and walk away, out of the room </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from My Ear At His Heart, by Hanif Kureishi, to be published by Faber and Faber on September 2 at \u00a312.99</p>",
  "<p>Robin Weir has to be the most knowledgeable ice cream fanatic that I have come across. His house in London is dedicated to the study of the subject, crammed with every conceivable device and shelves of literature regarding everything from ice cream machines to penny licks. </p> <p>The latter were serving glasses that people could take to an ice cream vendor, who would fill them up so that they could be enjoyed on the spot. That was before the introduction of the ice-cream cone. In spite of claims by the Americans and recent counter-claims in the Times, it is probable that the first commercial cones were invented by the Victorian queen of ice creams, Mrs Marshall. I have written more than once about my admiration for this remarkable woman. This was increased further by a handwritten book of hers dated 1893, a copy of which Weir was kind enough to forward to me. </p> <p>In the book, Marshall gives the recipe for something she calls Snow Cream. Place one pint of cold water in a bowl or pan with one quarter-pint of double cream, the juice of a lemon and two ounces of caster sugar. Whip together until the top is frothy. Take off the froth with a slice and place it on a hair sieve to drain. Carry on whipping until you can get no more froth from the liquid. When ready to serve, remove the froth from the sieve with a spoon. It makes a very pretty garnish for pastries or custard, states Marshall. </p> <p>Of course, what she has really invented is a precursor to all those flavoured foams and 'airs' that Ferran and Albert Adri\u00e0 of El Bulli developed 100 years later, and which are now so fashionable in restaurants around the world.</p>",
  "<p>They say that opposites attract and that the most unlikely couples often make the best partnerships. If shopping and making puddings were Olympic sports, my best friend, Mrs Perfect Housewife, would be a gold medallist. I, on the other hand, would always be left, along with the fat girl who smells, as the last to be picked for the team. I speak from experience, as I'm also utterly useless at sport. </p> <p>\"Come and see what I've just bought,\" Mrs PH gushed recently. \"And it's not another pair of white linen trousers.\" Feeling like Bert Fry from the Archers on being introduced to a mobile phone, I looked on in wonderment as she showed me her new ice-cream machine. </p> <p>Ice cream has come a long way since the synthetic horrors I remember from my childhood. Perhaps the nadir was reached when a certain Margaret Roberts (later Thatcher) allegedly came up with the formula for blending milk solids, sugar and artificial flavourings into something destined to be pedalled by Mr Whippy and others of his ilk. It may have been good chemistry, but it certainly wasn't real ice cream. </p> <p>Despite not being a natural eater of puddings, I have knocked up the occasional ice cream or sorbet for guests using the traditional method of beating the mixture at various points during the freezing process. But if I want a standard flavour such as vanilla or strawberry, it scarcely seems worth the bother of making it myself, since there are now plenty of perfectly respectable ice creams available in the shops. How shatteringly innovative to use real milk, real eggs and real fruit! Even petrol stations are selling the stuff. </p> <p>However, the more inventive efforts of H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Ben &amp; Jerry's et al leave me rather cold, as it were. Despite their sultry advertising campaigns, they essentially seem to comprise the contents of sweet shops in frozen form, and thus are best left to the under-12s. The manufacturer of Magnums might try to sell us sex on a stick, but that's child's play compared with the strictly adults-only pleasure revealed to me through the absinthe ice cream that Mrs PH made in her new toy. I was hooked. </p> <p>It's not only to do with the alcohol - although booze tends not to freeze, so its inclusion gives a user-friendly, soft-scoop quality to the finished product, as well as a cheering kick. </p> <p>The point is that ice creams and sorbets are great vehicles to carry combinations of flavours that would struggle to get past the first date, let alone to marry, in any other form. They can also rekindle the spark in couplings that may have gone stale; we are now past our initial flush of passion for chilled soups, English raspberries and the quintessential embodiment of summer that can be found in a glass of Pimm's. England's sublime asparagus is over for another year, the season for sea trout has just finished, and those of us who grow our own tomatoes are frankly tiring of the glut. </p> <p>We may be getting towards the end of the honeymoon period, but summer is not yet over. </p> <p>Ice creams and sorbets open up whole new horizons for jaded palates, and can inject a little light relief into the long summer holidays. They do not demand any technical wizardry or use of dangerous implements, so they can be tackled confidently by both adults and children. </p> <p>Kids seem to like stirring their favourite fruits or naughty sweets into a simple ice cream or sorbet base; I'd personally draw the line at sweetcorn and fruit gums in lemon sorbet, but then I can't see the attraction of Peter Andre or Pop-Tarts, either, so what would I know? </p> <p>Sweet or savoury, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination and good taste. Just bear in mind that very cold things take the edge off flavour, so err on the side of generosity with the salt and/or sugar when you taste prior to freezing. </p> <p>All recipes serve four to six. </p> <p><strong> Frozen gazpacho </strong><br> </p> <p>This makes a great starter served in a small bowl with a slug of vodka poured over the top. For the more soberly minded, it's also excellent scooped into an almond gazpacho, as described below. </p> <p>400g ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped <br>big cucumber, skinned and deseeded <br>2 cloves garlic, peeled <br>1 large red pepper <br>red chilli, deseeded (or more, if you like it fiery) <br>2 tbsp red-wine vinegar <br>3 tbsp olive oil <br>100ml water <br>Salt and pepper</p> <p>Throw all the ingredients into a food processor, whiz up until smooth and amalgamated, then pass through a fine sieve. Adjust the flavours with more oil, vinegar or salt according to taste, then churn in an ice-cream machine. Alternatively, freeze in a flattish tray in the freezer, whisking the mixture two or three times before it freezes solid. </p> <p><strong> Almond gazpacho</strong><br> </p> <p>Follow the above method, using 75g white breadcrumbs, 75g skinned almonds, 3 or 4 cloves garlic, 2 tbsp each of olive oil and white-wine vinegar, about 800ml water and salt. Add more water if you prefer a thinner consistency. Don't freeze it, but chill thoroughly before serving. </p> <p><strong> Grapefruit, Pimm's and mint sorbet</strong><br> </p> <p>This comes from Caroline Liddell and Robin Weir's excellent Ices - The Definitive Guide (Grub Street, 1995). </p> <p>100g caster sugar <br>150ml Pimm's <br>Juice of 3 large grapefruits <br>Juice of lemon <br>125ml water <br>10 mint leaves, rolled and finely chopped (a chiffonade, as chefs would call it) <br>1 egg white</p> <p>Dissolve the sugar in the Pimm's, add to the rest of the ingredients (except the egg white) in a shallow freezer-proof tray, and freeze, either in an ice-cream machine or in the freezer. When the mixture is half frozen - after about 10 minutes in a machine, 45 in a freezer - lightly whip the egg white, stir into the mixture and carry on freezing. </p> <p><strong> Raspberry and Cointreau spoom </strong><br> </p> <p>A spoom is essentially a sorbet in which the egg whites are whipped with sugar to make a kind of meringue mixture before being frozen with the fruit base. </p> <p>For the syrup </p> <p>125ml boiling water <br>100g caster sugar <br>300g raspberries <br>1 lime, juiced and zested <br>75ml Cointreau</p> <p>To finish </p> <p>2 egg whites <br>50g caster sugar</p> <p>First make the syrup. Pour the boiling water on to the sugar, stir until dissolved, cool, then add the fruit and pur\u00e9e. Pass through a fine sieve and chill. Once cold, stir in the lime juice and zest, and the Cointreau. Add more lime juice if it's too sweet. </p> <p>Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually add the sugar. Fold the raspberry mixture into the egg whites - it calls to mind raspberry ripple at this stage - and freeze. If you're making this without a machine, it needs stirring up only once during the freezing. </p> <p><strong> Banana and gin ice cream</strong><br> </p> <p>Repulsive though this may sound, it won top marks in the sweet category at the ice-cream tasting party I held last weekend. I share Jane Grigson's view that gin in the store cupboard can be mother's little helper, as well as her ruin. It marries so well with many fruits, with equal success, I've substituted the bananas for about 250g of strawberries and blackcurrants. </p> <p>2 very ripe bananas <br>1 lemon, juiced <br>100g sugar <br>125ml cream <br>125ml milk <br>150ml gin</p> <p>Whiz up all the ingredients together, then freeze in the normal fashion. </p> <p><strong> Brown bread ice cream</strong><br> </p> <p>I've included this classic because it is perhaps the antithesis of the above, somewhat outr\u00e9, recipes. It is very old-fashioned, needs no mid-freeze stirring and contains no alcohol (although the addition of a slug of dark rum would not go amiss, should the mood take you). </p> <p>90g wholemeal breadcrumbs <br>200ml double cream <br>100ml milk <br>50g soft brown sugar <br>1 egg</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and toast the breadcrumbs on a flat baking sheet until slightly crisp. </p> <p>Beat together the cream, milk, sugar and egg until light and fluffy. Stir in the breadcrumbs when they are cold. Freeze in the normal way.</p>",
  "In 1968 John Slater, who has died aged 63 of asbestos-related cancer, joined Granada TV as a general researcher. Within 18 months he was on World In Action, and his radical credentials - he was a co-founder of the Campaign For Nuclear Disarmament's (CND's) Sanity magazine - were a perfect fit with television's most iconic investigative series. <p>John went on to become a broadcaster passionate about politics and social history, whose work was invariably filtered through a highly developed sense of the absurd. In one early World In Action he persuaded an entire community to quit smoking. </p> <p>It was this ability to organise people, to persuade, inspire and cajole that attracted the attention of then then World In Action executive producer Gus (now Lord) Macdonald. Alongside Chris Pye, John was given the task of rejuvenating Granada's regional output, engaging the local community and incidentally destroying the BBC's Look North - a programme regarded by Granada as little more than a televised press release. </p> <p>He became its editor, and assembled a team of presenters led by Bob Greaves which included Anna Ford, Tony Wilson, Trevor Hyett, Bernard Clark and Gordon Burns. Alongside more serious items, competitions were launched for the dirtiest street in the north-west, and, following a newspaper report that sheep had developed into intelligent animals, 40 woolly guests were interviewed with questions from the Times crossword. </p> <p>In the mid-1970s John turned freelance, and taught at the National Film and Television School - he was always prepared to pass on his knowledge and enthusiasm. He was also a bon viveur. Incessant travel between London and Manchester, had fueled his disgust with motorway service station food. The result, in 1980, after months research, was Just Off The Motorway, his guide to pubs and restaurants within reach of the junctions. </p> <p>By the early 1980s, with the advent of Channel 4, John set up one of the earliest independent production companies, Mirageland, co-owned with the publisher Anthony Blond and David Starkey. In the late 1970s John had hired the historian to appear on a Russell Harty-presented Granada series, Behave Yourself, that John produced. With Starkey, John made C4's first major history series, This Land of England (1985). </p> <p>John was the son of a tyre company executive and educated at Mercers school, and then the City of London school and St Catherine's College, Oxford. Disappointed by his first chemistry lecture, he switched to politics, philosophy and economics. It was at Oxford that he met his first wife, Gilly - and began a lifelong association with CND. After university he worked as the campaign's information officer. Then, after a spell teaching in central Africa, came Granada. </p> <p>From 1990 until 1991 he worked at the BBC at Elstree, first as head of the history unit - and then as head of the corporation's south-east region. He turned Elstree into a home for the waifs and strays, the talented, the unmanageable. John had an ability to spot, nurture and enhance talent. </p> <p>His brief then had been to popularise history at a time when it was far from fashionable and programmes from Terry Jones and Simon Schama followed. Then there was Masterchef on BBC 1, presented by Loyd Grossman originated by film director Frank Roddam, and a programme networked well before the schedules were swamped by cookery. </p> <p>One beneficiary of his policies was Paul Watson. Regarded by his BBC bosses as a hugely talented but trifle awkward documentary maker, Paul sought shelter under John's benign regime. Together they hijacked budgets to finance Sylvania Waters (1992), the Australian version of Watson's 1974 The Family. In the teeth of my implacable opposition - I was then the BBC1 controller - the programme attracted welcome controversy and plaudits. </p> <p>After leaving the BBC in 1991, John moved to Grosmont on the Welsh/English border. His first wife, Jilly, had died of cancer and he met his second wife Fiona McKenzie at the 1983 Edinburgh TV Festival. John had returned to his roots. In 1995, their company Black Hill Productions made a nuclear history documentary, Geiger Sweet, Geiger Sour, and there was a Radio 4 series that year, too, Atomica, America about American human radiology experiments. </p> <p>In 1997, John received a MacArthur grant to write a history of the British nuclear deterrent. After years of research, this work remains unfinished, but it will be. In a singular twist of fate some of the files to which he needed access have not been released. The reason given is that they are contaminated with asbestos. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Fiona, three children from his first marriage and three from his second, and by his mother. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Slater, writer and broadcaster, born June 22 1941; died August 6 2004</p>",
  "<b>Dear Inayat,</b> <br> The road to hell, goes the saying, is paved with good intentions. Like the letter you sent out to mosques earlier this year. asking them to be vigilant in the phoney \"war on terror\", the Muslim Council of Britain's latest advice to British Muslims in its pamphlet, Know Your Rights and Responsibilities, may be sincere enough. But by appealing to Britain's Muslims to remember their duties vis a vis \"terrorism\", it is likely to fan the flames it seeks to extinguish. <p>Since well before the atrocities of 9/11, the trajectory of government legislation and policy has been to demonise and criminalise the Muslim community, a fact that the much-quoted discrepancy between arrest and conviction figures starkly illustrates. The focus of British Muslim organisations' work should be directed at undermining this cynical government agenda, not supporting it. <br> <b>Yours, Faisal</b></p> <p><b>Dear Faisal, </b><br> In a well-known hadith, the blessed Prophet Muhammad advised us that \"actions are but by intention, and everyone shall be rewarded according to that which they intended\". To be sure, intentions ought to be matched by practical actions if we are to build a cohesive society. So I am puzzled by your criticism of our letter to the mosques and now the guide to rights and responsibilities.</p> <p>The guide points out that Muslims - especially children of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent - are underachieving educationally, and urges greater parental interest and involvement. It notes the growing disaffection among Muslims and anger at their disenfranchisement over the Iraq war, and it calls for increased participation in the mainstream parties.</p> <p>Both the letter and the guide accept that, in the wake of the terrible Madrid train bombings last March, there is an increased terror threat to the UK. We reiterate that averting a terrorist attack in which innocents would be put in jeopardy is an Islamic imperative, and it is the duty of all - Muslims included - to help the authorities prevent such an atrocity.</p> <p>The constant demonisation of British Muslims - often from pro-Israeli quarters - is wholly unacceptable, and I agree that the government's disastrous participation in Bush's wars have done our country - us included - immense harm. We have conveyed this forcefully to ministers on several occasions. I would welcome your thoughts on further measures we could take to halt the marginalisation of British Muslims.<br> <b>Salaams, Inayat</b></p> <p><b>Dear Inayat,</b><br> You appear to have misread my very specific criticism of your advice on terrorism, which - worryingly - seems to be based entirely on the government's unproven claims of an increased threat to the mainland. The approach might curry favour in Whitehall but, with Muslim distrust of officials running at an all-time high, whatever initiatives they may craft to tackle the community's exclusion risk being stillborn.</p> <p>Wielding a club in one hand and a carrot in the other is not the answer. Muslim alienation is increasingly rooted in Islamophobia. One practical step would be to stop resisting calls for legislation outlawing religious discrimination, a move that would undermine this pernicious Muslim-bashing.</p> <p>This is not to play the victim. The community has many problems, many of them the legacy of immigration and internal mismanagement. The government can play a part in the process of reform, but it cannot run the show.<br> <b>Faisal</b></p> <p><b>Dear Faisal</b><br> In fact, it was a key plank of the antiwar argument that - contrary to the government's assertions - our participation in an illegal, unjust war against Iraq would surely increase the threat of terrorism to our shores. A House of Commons select committee recently conceded that this was indeed now the case.</p> <p>Anyway, I am heartened to see that the one practical measure you propose we take - to call on the government to enact legislation outlawing religious discrimination - is one the MCB has been vigorously pursuing since its inception in 1997! The Home Office-sponsored Derby Report (2000) also made the same call. Since December 2003, as the result of an EU directive, religious discrimination has been outlawed in employment and training. This should be welcomed, and acknowledged.</p> <p>Still, as long as the government delays the comprehensive introduction of religious discrimination legislation - not only in relation to employment, but also in the provision of goods and services - there will remain a hierarchy of rights, with British Muslims, as a multi-ethnic minority, having less rights than racially distinct minoritiessuch as Jews and Sikhs, who are protected under existing racial discrimination laws.<br> <b>Inayat</b></p> <p><b>Dear Inayat</b><br> While we can both agree that the war on Iraq has not endeared the government to Muslims, it does not follow that this has raised the risk of terrorism to the level claimed by the government, let alone turned sections of the community into a near and present danger.</p> <p>In fact, such a conclusion requires a huge leap of faith, as was pointed out by the most recent parliamentary review of anti-terrorism legislation. The joint committee on human rights (July 2004) said its members had \"never been presented with the evidence which would enable us to be satisfied of the existence of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation but have proceeded on the basis that there might be such evidence\".</p> <p>You make an important point about the EU Employment Framework Directive 2003 employment law, but seem to assign credit where it is not due. Rather than being an uncharacteristic act of governmental goodwill, the equality laws were forced on London from Brussels.</p> <p>I have no doubt that more mainstream political involvement is key to escaping the current quagmire. My concern is that the agendas of those speaking for the community should be coming from the bottom up, rather than top down.<br> <b>Faisal</b></p> <p><b>Dear Faisal</b><br> I had hoped that the words \"EU directive\" would have been a clear enough indication as to the origin of the legislation! Never mind.</p> <p>Still, can we agree that it is possible for both of the following statements to be simultaneously true? a) In light of events since 9/11 (including Bali, Istanbul, Casablanca and Madrid) it is prudent to assume that there is an increased terror threat facing the UK, and b) numerous aspects of the government's response to this threat, including the detention without trial of foreign nationals, are unjust and unworthy of our democracy.</p> <p>Certainly, the high-profile series of anti-terror raids (with many quietly released without charge), the large increase in the numbers of young Muslim men being stopped and searched, and the constant denigration of Islam and its followers in much of the UK media, has left many British Muslims unsettled and even fearful.</p> <p>I am pleased you agree that mainstream political involvement is key to escaping this current quagmire. I did ask you what additional measures you think we should be taking, and you appeared somewhat flummoxed. It's still not too late ...<br> <b>Inayat</b></p> <p><b>Dear Inayat </b><br> I really don't mind being the one proposing all the practical measures here, but I would have expected an organisation that bills itself as the most representative of Muslims in the UK to have put forward at least a few of its own.</p> <p>If organisations such as the MCB are to earn legitimacy, they must learn to carry the community with them. That can only come from adopting a more inclusive approach - something that will also serve as a more effective check against the temptation to accept an imposed agenda.</p> <p>The priorities facing the Muslim community are evident: government action to roll back unemployment, investment in inner cities, better education, fair treatment in the allocation of goods and services for our organisations, removal of the bars to public participation, and greater sensitivity to Muslim concerns with foreign policy issues such as Palestine and Iraq.</p> <p>Since this is not the forum for detail, and I am not a politician, the details of their implementation can be left to our legislators, executives and their consultants, provided, of course, they can bear to banish the bogey of terrorism from their minds.<br> <b>Faisal</b></p> <p><b>Dear Faisal</b><br> You appear to confuse listing a set of objectives - which is the easy bit - with providing practical suggestions on how to achieve those objectives. I would suggest that simply drawing up a list of demands on a piece of paper, and handing it to \"legislators, executives and their consultants\" may not be enough to deliver the results in the real world.</p> <p>The pocket guide is a simple example of an attempt to help empower the grassroots of an ostracised community to exert greater efforts towards self-upliftment.</p> <p>Still, I do hope you will try and develop your suggestions further. The MCB is always open to receiving advice. Advice given, we trust, with the best of intentions.<br> <b>Salaam, Inayat</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Faisal Bodi is a British journalist and a senior editor for aljazeera.net; Inayat Bunglawala is media secretary at the Muslim Council of Britain, and former editor of the Muslim youth magazine Trends</p>",
  "<p>Britain's Campbell Walsh won a silver medal in the men's kayak slalom yesterday, though it might have been a gold if he had paddled a little harder and paid less attention to the on-course commentator. </p> <p>\"I thought I heard him say I was in the lead, so I eased up at the end,\" the affable Scot said after two exhilarating runs down the 260-metre course, which is the focal point of this stimulating venue. </p> <p>Kayaking is that kind of sport, the kind of sport where the athletes listen to the commentators as they battle fizzing whitewater rapids; where an Olympic bronze medallist, in this case a goofy-looking Frenchman called Fabien Lefevre, says he would like to thank his coach, Michael Jordan and \"my arms\"; and where the eventual winner negotiates the course accompanied by the theme song from the movie Jaws. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Walsh, there were no sharks around to swallow the Frenchman Benoit Peschier before he reached the end of a second run that lifted him from second to first place. The Nottingham-based student, who was leading by a quarter of a point after the first run, still had the chance to seize the gold medal but hit problems early in his second run down a course in which he had tonegotiate 20 gates, six of them upstream. </p> <p>\"I hit a wave head-on coming out of gate five. I'm the lightest guy in the field and, when I hit head-on like that, I get more affected than the others. I could still have won after that but I was too cautious,\" he said. </p> <p>At first it seemed as if his medal was bronze but a mix-up by the time-keepers was quickly corrected. \"When I finished and looked up at the board I couldn't see my name at all. I'd no idea what was going on,\" the Briton said. \"I was going for gold but a silver's not bad at all.\" </p> <p>As for the commentator and his big mouth, Walsh did not seem unduly bothered. \"It didn't really cost me. Listening to the commentator as I'm going down is normal for me. In fact, if I can hear the commentator, that's when I know I am most relaxed.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, if he had stomped from the podium to the commentator's perch and shoved a microphone down his throat, it would have been entirely in the spirit of the kayaking events, which have turned out to be the surprise hit of the games - or, as one veteran of Sydney 2000 described it, \"the new beach volleyball\". </p> <p>That may be going too far but there is no denying the sport's popularity in Athens. While other venues have echoed to the sound of rustling ice-cream wrappers in the cheap seats, the kayaking venue has sold out its 8,000 tickets every day. </p> <p>Part of the appeal is the figure-of-eight course, the only one of its kind in the world. It was built for the Olympics on the site of the old Athens airport at a cost of $26m (\u00a314.2m). Six massive turbines pump water from the base to the start line, from where it drops seven metres over the 260m race distance. Artificial waves and eddies are created by plastic bollards placed at various points on the course. </p> <p>It looks both frightening and stunning, the visual element helped by the use of seawater, which is more \"vibrant\" than fresh water. Add pumping music, raucous fans, many of them dressed for beach volleyball, and a couple of commentators - even if they do get things wrong - and the upshot is a spectacle loved not only by the television cameras but by everybody. That includes the British kayaking team, which has now claimed two medals in Athens. </p> <p>Earlier this week Helen Reeves won bronze in the women's kayaking. The men's double team of Stuart Bowman and Nick Smith had also been expected to win a medal in yesterday's canoe slalom but failed to reach the final after finishing 10th in their semi-final. However, that did not take away from the British team's appreciation of the venue. </p> <p>\"It's definitely the best in the world, the most lively,\" Walsh said. \"There's a good choice of music, great crowds and a couple of good Americans doing the commentary. I wish I was up there in the crowd watching the event. </p> <p>\"I've seen a few events on TV this week and this is much more exciting than any of them.\" He did not specify which sports he was referring to but the dressage riders might have a word the next time they bump into him at the athletes' village.</p>",
  "<p>\"I'm not looking to make a living out of it,\" Paula Radcliffe said one afternoon, sitting on the narrow bed of room 21 in court 5A of the halls of residence at Loughborough University. \"Obviously it's nice that there's a bit of money coming in but that's not my goal. I just want to do my best and still enjoy it.\" Then she stood up, put on her parka and headed off to do some training. </p> <p>That was 11 winters ago and a week earlier she had turned a few heads by coming second in the Durham international cross-country race. On a frosty afternoon at Aykley Heads, in her first race as a senior, the tall, slender girl finished behind Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia and ahead of Elana Mayer of South Africa, the two runners who had taken first and second places in the Olympic 10,000 metres in Barcelona the previous summer. Radcliffe was 19 then and on her way to a first-class honours degree in modern European studies but she was also taking the first steps in a career that would make her the most admired British athlete of her generation. </p> <p>A regime of hyperbaric chambers and ice baths and a diet of ostrich steaks and wheatgrass juice were a long way in the future but even then she had an air of determination beneath the modesty and charm. She had practised for the Durham race not on roads but on frozen lanes and she had walked the course, carefully noting its features. Paula Radcliffe was by no means sure that athletics would turn out to be her career but she was leaving nothing to chance. </p> <p>Something like 50,000 training miles later that attention to detail is about to face its greatest test. Tomorrow Radcliffe's career reaches its climax when she sets off from the village of Marathon on a journey of 26 miles and 385 yards that she hopes will finally secure her place in history. And, of all the marathons to win, this is surely the one. A victory in the footsteps of the messenger whose epic feat inspired the event would give Radcliffe's bobbing head a permanent place in the iconography of sport. </p> <p>At a stroke it would remove the bitter memory of all those years of fourth and fifth places on the big occasions, all those medals conceded to rivals - usually Ethiopians - who dogged her footsteps for lap after lap before sprinting past in the final stages with never a backward glance as she suddenly laboured in their wake. It would erase the famous image of the row with her husband, Gary Lough, at the finish line in Edmonton at the 2001 world championships, when she tried the reverse tactics of taking on the Ethiopians in a sprint finish and failed at that, too. </p> <p>Radcliffe has worked long and hard to overcome the obstacles that nature placed in her path, to the extent that two years ago, after twice breaking the world marathon record, she was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year and the International Association of Athletics Federations' woman athlete of the year. The material rewards have come, in the shape of a lucrative Nike contract and starting money that is now said to have reached a quarter of a million pounds for the big races. She and Lough, a fellow runner whom she met at university, maintain a house in Loughborough but for the last few years have adopted an annual routine based on an apartment in Font Romeu, high in the French Pyrenees, where she lives and trains. In the winters she spends several weeks at altitude in the helpful climate of Albuquerque, New Mexico. </p> <p>When she talked, all those years ago, about the remote possibility of doing some altitude training, she wondered whether it was true what people had told her, that you could get lonely. She thought she would cope. She was pretty self-sufficient. \"I think I could keep myself occupied,\" she said. When she went for a run in the hills around Loughborough, her brain would be going through her French, German or economics revision. Sometimes she let a song run through her head. That gave her a rhythm to which she could run. </p> <p>Even then she was talking at length about the subject of doping, which would become such a preoccupation that she began a campaign to promote blood-testing and appeared in the grandstands in Edmonton carrying a placard denouncing Olga Yegereva, the Russian 5,000m runner. </p> <p>\"It doesn't affect me much in my event,\" she said back in 1993, \"but it does make me angry. It's so unfair. It depends what you're in sport for. If it's the money, I can see it would be a big temptation. But, if you're in it just to do your best, I can't see how you could do it because you wouldn't be able to believe in what you'd achieved.\" </p> <p>She started running because it was fun, which is the one thing it has never looked to those watching her exertions from the trackside or on television. The bobbing head, the straining limbs, the nasal strip, the knee-length compression stockings, the cotton gloves to wipe the sweat from her head, all created an impression of someone running against adversity. </p> <p>Which was largely true, given that she has suffered since childhood from asthma and anaemia, two conditions which might be thought to have disqualified her from the life of a champion long-distance runner, an existence as relentlessly gruelling off the track as on it and supremely demanding of breath and blood. But since she discovered her gift the quest has been to discover ways of overcoming those built-in handicaps and unlocking the talent within. </p> <p>She was recovering from a bad bout of anaemia in 1992 when she beat Wang Junxia and Gete Wami in Boston to become the world junior cross-country champion. The condition, inherited from her mother, is exacerbated by the kind of intensive training she requires, and so she has a diet devised by her nutritionist, Brian Welsby, and hence the preference for venison and ostrich meat, high in iron and low in fat. </p> <p>Wheatgrass juice - \"it doesn't look or taste very nice,\" she has said - provides a cocktail of minerals and amino-acids. And, surprisingly, the menu includes chocolate, which delivers magnesium and zinc as well as iron. Nor is she averse to a glass or two of a good red wine. But the girl who said in 1993 that \"I never worry about what I eat; I just eat when I'm hungry\" now also takes vitamins and supplements, drinks four litres of mineral water a day, eats raw vegetables and is careful to avoid those things, such as cheese and caffeinated drinks, which inhibit the body's ability to absorb iron. </p> <p>Gerard Hartman, a former Irish triathlete, supervises her physical preparation, delivering painful but effective deep massage. She trains twice a day, running for two to three hours and covering 140 miles a week, and allows her body to recover by sleeping 10 hours a night and 2 hours every afternoon. The asthma is kept at bay not just by the nasal strips but by a pre-race routine which includes several short sprints. </p> <p>This Spartan discipline was imposed when she grew tired of being second - or fourth or fifth - best and decided to do whatever it took to realise her potential. The change up to the marathon three years ago was the final gear-shift in a career that began with the 800m in childhood and moved to 1500m at under-15 level and 3,000m two years later, followed by graduation to 5,000m and 10,000m. In her first full marathon, in London in 2002, she set a new European record. Later that year in Chicago she lowered the world record by 1min 29sec, leaving it at 2min 17.8sec. Last year in London she reduced it still further, setting the current mark of 2min 15.25sec. Victories in half-marathons in Portugal and Mexico proved that she could run in the sort of heat she will encounter tomorrow. </p> <p>Her father had run marathons as a young man and, when he took it up again in an attempt to lose weight after stopping smoking, the young Paula trotted alongside. She started going to Frodsham Athletic Club, near their home in Northwich, and when the family moved south she joined a group of girls at Bedford and County AC, under the supervision of Alec and Rosemary Stanton. Her father became vice-chairman of the club and her mother, a fun-runner, managed the women's cross-country team. </p> <p>\"You can't tell how anyone's going to turn out,\" Alec Stanton said back then. \"At 11 years of age they're all ordinary little girls. And that's how they are until they're 16; some are going forward, some are going back. Paula was never a southern champion at under-13 level, for instance. But it's often the good runners who make great runners, if you see what I mean. When they get to 15 or so, really, that's the nitty-gritty. Of course, if you've got the right mum and dad it's a big help. Sometimes you see ones who aren't satisfied with their daughter's performance. They can't stop pushing. Paula's lucky there.\" </p> <p>She has never been pushed. Any pushing came from within. Her parents and her coaches encouraged her to make sure that she got her academic qualifications first. As for the running, they would see how it went. If she turned out to be really good, the decision would make itself. </p> <p>Twenty years after he started working with her, the 68-year-old Stanton is still her coach, although Gary Lough now supervises her training. Back in 1993 she was in negotiation with an agent, Jon Holmes, whose Nottingham-based company also handled Gary Lineker, Rob Andrew and - until his fall from grace - Will Carling. Now her affairs are handled by Octagon, a multinational marketing company. Sian Masterson, once Anna Kournikova's agent, is the Octagon executive in charge of Radcliffe's affairs and has spent the last few months keeping the media at bay. Interviews and press conferences have been cancelled with a regularity suggesting that Radcliffe, normally approachable and co-operative, wants absolutely nothing to disturb her concentration on tomorrow's big moment. </p> <p>Even now concerns persist about her fitness. The operation following a knee injury caused by crouching on the floor to write thank-you letters for wedding presents may be a distant memory but after losing a race in Puerto Rico last winter she admitted that she had been suffering from respiratory viruses brought on by severe training. And she arrived in Athens, where she is entered for next Friday's 10,000m as well as tomorrow's marathon, to be greeted by rumours that she had been seen at the clinic of the sports specialist Dr Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt a few days earlier, apparently seeking treatment for a calf injury. </p> <p>\"This is the biggest two weeks of Paula's career,\" her agent told journalists the other day, explaining yet another cancellation. \"Not of your life. Not of my life. Not of your colleagues' lives.\" </p> <p>Eleven years ago life was a great deal simpler for the girl in the parka. \"I want to keep on enjoying it, keep on improving, get as much out of it as I can and put as much back as I can,\" she said then. Whatever happens this weekend will make a difference but it could never make her a failure.</p>",
  "<p>If Paula Radcliffe wins tomorrow's marathon, she will not be the first member of her family to claim an Olympic medal, writes <strong>Duncan Mackay</strong>. In 1920 at the Antwerp games, Charlotte Radcliffe was a member of the British swimming team that won silver in the 4x100 metres freestyle relay. </p> <p>If her niece does join her on the family roll of honour, then Paula is certain to receive a bit more publicity than great-aunt Charlotte did. There was no mention in The Times the next day, nor the day after that, when a brief Olympic report appeared between a notice about the Westminster Abbey Fund and news of, as the headline put it, \"Another Successful Sale of Pure Bred British Friesian Cattle at Shepton Mallet\". \"I did see the medal when I was a little girl,\" Radcliffe said. \"But it's got lost over the years.\" </p> <p>Those games in Antwerp were remembered chiefly for the dominance in the tennis of Suzanne Lenglen, who lost only four games in the 10 sets she played on her way to winning the gold medal. They were also the only summer games that included ice hockey, while tug-of-war appeared for the final time. </p> <p>Women were not allowed to participate in track and field, let alone run as far as 26.2 miles. Hannes Kolehmainen, one of the first of the famous \"Flying Finns\", won the men's event, setting a world record of 2hr 32min 35sec - 17 minutes slower than Radcliffe's women's world best, set last year. </p> <p>It is also extremely unlikely that Radcliffe will celebrate in the same manner as the bronze medallist, Valerio Arri, who performed three cartwheels as he crossed the line.</p>",
  "A French court yesterday found two men guilty of helping immigrants left homeless by the closure of the Sangatte refugee camp near the Channel tunnel, but let them off without a sentence. <p>Prosecutors had requested three-month suspended sentences against Jean-Claude Lenoir and Charles Frammezelle, two campaigners from a humanitarian group helping asylum seekers stranded in Calais. </p> <p>Two years after the closure of the Sangatte camp, the dream of a new life in Britain is still luring asylum hopefuls to France's northern coast. </p> <p>The criminal court in Boulogne-sur-Mer found Lenoir and Frammezelle not guilty of providing housing for illegal immigrants, saying they had provided humanitarian aid. </p> <p>But it found them guilty of helping illegal immigrants in an organised group and of allowing their names to be used to transfer funds on somebody else's behalf. </p> <p>Some 50 protesters demonstrated in front of the court carrying banners saying \"solidarity is not a crime\". </p> <p>The men had housed 10 asylum seekers so that they would not have to sleep in the street.</p>",
  "The battered body of a British man was found yesterday morning on a rubber plantation in southern Thailand. <p>Police believe the 25-year-old was killed elsewhere by muggers before being dumped at the plantation, near Sungai Kolok, 750 miles south of Bangkok. </p> <p>Major Colonel Chalerm Yingkong, of the local police, told Reuters: \"His face was smashed and we found no documents on him.\" </p> <p>Police were only able to identify the body once they had found the man's passport at his hotel, which was also in Sungai Kolok. </p> <p>The Foreign Office said last night that its consulate officials were attempting to find out what had happened, but the time difference was making this more difficult. </p> <p>The victim's next of kin had not yet been informed. </p> <p>\"We are aware of the incident and consul staff are seeking urgent further information, but details are sketchy,\" a spokeswoman said. </p> <p>The Foreign Office has issued travel warnings for Thailand urging particular vigilance at tourist sites, hotels in airports, on public transport, and in nightclubs, restaurants and places of worship. </p> <p>\"Thailand shares with the rest of south-east Asia a threat from terrorism. Attacks could be indiscriminate and against civilian targets, including places frequented by foreigners,\" the Foreign Office website says. </p> <p>The border town of Sungai Kolok is known for its sex industry and is popular among Malaysian male tourists. </p> <p>The mainly Malay-speaking area has been hit twice by bomb attacks since January. Although most Thais are Buddhist, the deep southern provinces have a Muslim majority. </p> <p>Official sources say they believe that Islamist militants are behind the brutality, which is directed mostly at local security personnel. </p> <p>The man is believed to be the first westerner killed in the region since the unrest began. </p> <p>The prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, expressed his defiance yesterday against the spate of violence in the south which has claimed more than 300 lives since January . </p> <p>But just hours after his speech a bomb exploded under a pick-up truck near a cock-fighting arena which housed hundreds of spectators in the southern province of Narathiwat. It damaged nearby vehicles but caused no injuries. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday a similar device was discovered outside a Thai Military Bank branch office in the same province. It was destroyed an hour before it was set to explode.</p>"
