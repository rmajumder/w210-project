  "The bloody denouement to the Beslan tragedy was barbaric: no other word will suffice. There could never be any justification for terrorists who we are told shot fleeing hostages in the back - nor for those who died at the hands of the ill-judged Spetsnaz operation. I have been asked many times about Chechen involvement in this appalling bloodbath. Of course there can be no denying the direct link between the Beslan tragedy and the war in Chechnya. The president of North Ossetia, Alexander Dzasokhov, made it clear that the terrorists' only demand was an end to the war in Chechnya and the withdrawal of all the Russian forces from our country. <p>For the past five years that has been the sole concern of the Chechen nation, led by its legitimate, elected president, Aslan Maskhadov: to end the fighting and force Russian troops to leave Chechnya. </p> <p>Ten years ago Chechnya had a population of 2 million. Today it is 800,000, and Vladimir Putin has an army of what we estimate to be up to 300,000 Russian soldiers in Chechnya inflicting a regime of terror. Many Chechens are refugees and many others have simply disappeared, often in the night. At least 200,000 Chechen civilians have been killed by Russian soldiers, including 35,000 children. Another 40,000 children have been seriously injured, 32,000 have lost at least one parent and 6,500 have been orphaned. These are figures supported by reports of human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, and we believe they are conservative. This is how Putin's soldiers treat Chechen civilians. </p> <p>We feel trapped on a treadmill which is not of our own making. In 1990, at the height of Mikhail Gorbachov's perestroika, we were told that our republic would be put on an equal footing with others in a renewed Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union collapsed and in 1993 Russia decided that if it was to recreate its empire within the former frontiers, it could start with us. There was no justification for Russia invading Chechnya either in 1994 or in 1999. </p> <p> In 1993, four years after our declaration of sovereignty, Russia arbitrarily included the Chechen Republic as part of its territory in the new constitution of the Russian federation. It did this in spite of the way things were, de facto and de jure, for Chechnya and its neighbours. Unlike other formerly autonomous Soviet republics, the Chechen republic did not give in to the many threats intended to force it to sign the federal treaty with Russia. </p> <p>When Putin unleashed the dogs of war on Chechnya in order to occupy it for a second time, he christened his attack a \"counter-terrorist operation in the northern Caucasus\". Many of us did not realise the significance of that then. Now, with hindsight, we can see that the idea was to discredit the very notion of statehood for Chechnya. While a minority of Chechens regarded Putin's onslaught against us as justified, the majority of the nation has kept faith with its elected president, Maskhadov. </p> <p>Five years have passed since then, and little has changed. Especially since September 11 2001, President Maskhadov's government has systematically disowned any links with international terrorism. Such assurances, however, have not been enough: the lack of any evidence of links between us and any international terrorist network has failed to dent the firmly held views of Putin and his friends. </p> <p>Putin has been blaming every act of terrorism in Russia on the Chechens and by his linking our efforts to achieve freedom with monstrous acts of terrorism, each more terrible than the last, Putin and his government are trying to force us to renounce any claims to independence. The Kremlin will not, however, succeed. Freedom for Chechnya is in our blood and in the struggle that stretches back for centuries. President Maskhdov and his supporters, including myself, will never endorse or support terrorism to achieve this independence. Our aim is to strive for a peaceful resolution to an end to the barbaric injustice that is being dealt out to the Chechens by Russia's government. </p> <p>Putin is keen to get the international community to see the situation in Chechnya as part of the war on international terror. He hopes the outside world will leave him alone to inflict his regime of terror on the Chechens. The international community knows that the situation in Chechnya is quite different, so why does no one intervene? We are keen to participate in mediation to bring an end to this dreadful situation for the Chechens. We call on the international community to step in and help bring peace to both Chechnya and to Russia. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ahmed Zakaev is Aslan Maskhadov's representative and was deputy prime minister in the Chechen government elected in 1997.

  "The Andalusian economist Tom\u00e1s Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, who has died aged 93, spent 37 years in exile between the end of the Spanish civil war and the death, in 1975, of the dictator Francisco Franco. A member of the Spanish Communist party (PCE), Garc\u00eda made sacrifices in the resistance; these, and his subsequent willingness to reach historic compromises, contributed to the transition to democracy. <p>During his years in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Mexico (where he ran the World Federation of Democratic Youth), France and Czechoslovakia, Garc\u00eda became one of the PCE's leading intellectuals, publishing numerous books on politics and agrarian economics, many under the nom de guerre Juan G\u00f3mez. He joined the PCE central committee in 1952, and its executive in 1956. </p> <p>After Franco's death, Garc\u00eda hurried home to play a key backroom role in the Moncloa Palace negotiations that led to free elections to the 1977 constituent assembly. He was elected to represent M\u00e1laga - the constituency that, in 1933, returned Spain's first PCE MP, Cayetano Bol\u00edvar - and combined his work on the new Spanish constitution with responsibility for industry and energy policy in the And- alusian regional administration. Returned to the Madrid parliament in the first democratic election, he continued his pursuit of national reconciliation, making firm friends across the political spectrum. He also pressed for the fuller degree of autonomy that Andalusia won in 1980. </p> <p>Garc\u00eda was born in \u00c1lora, north of M\u00e1laga. He became politically active under the Primo de Rivera dictatorship of the 1920s, and joined the PCE in 1931, while studying for a law degree in Madrid. He then took a doctorate in economics, became a founder of the Communist Youth and was close to the literary circle around Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Rafael Alberti. </p> <p>Appointed to the civil service under the second Spanish republic, Garc\u00eda remained loyal to the government during Franco's revolt, and ended up in a camp in France before beginning his long exile. </p> <p>After he retired from public life in 1982, a family inheritance enabled him to create an educational charity for disadvantaged students in his beloved \u00c1lora, where the public library bears his name. He retired to the picturesque village of Alcauc\u00edn, in M\u00e1laga province, where he died at home. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Teresa Azc\u00e1rate, two daughters and a son. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Tom\u00e1s Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, economist and politician, born 1911; died August 9 2004</p>",
  "Papa Wemba, the world music star known as the King of Congolese Rumba Rock, will be tried in France in October for allegedly smuggling at least 150 people into the country by claiming they were members of his band, his French lawyer said yesterday. <p>Yves Leberquier said the singer, who spent three months in prison last year before being released on bail, would appear in court on October 25 charged with aiding illegal immigration, forgery, fraudulently obtaining official documents and criminal association. He faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine of \u20ac750,000 (\u00a3500,000). </p> <p>A police spokesman said \"several hundred\" people from the Democratic Republic of Congo had entered France and Belgium illegally over the past few years on visas issued on the understanding that they were members of Wemba's group, Viva la Musica. </p> <p>\"Up to 100 would come over at a time claiming to be performers in his bands,\" the spokesman said. \"Of course most of them never went home again. This was a well-organised illegal immigration operation.\" </p> <p>The performer faces similar charges in Belgium, where some of his \"musicians\" arrested last February said they had paid $3,500 (\u00a32,000) to get to Europe. Seven members of Wemba's entourage, including producers and managers, will appear alongside the 55-year-old star in Bobigny, north of Paris. </p> <p>Papa Wemba, a Belgian citizen, was born Shungu Wembadio Pene Kikumba in the former Zaire, where he burst on to the local music scene with his first band, Zaiko Langa Langa, in 1969. </p> <p>Since 1977, playing with his current group, he has enjoyed huge success in Africa and Europe, where he settled in the 1980s to pursue his international career. Among the world music stars he has worked with is the former Genesis singer, Peter Gabriel. </p> <p>Under police investigation since December 2000, Papa Wemba has admitted to French and Belgian police obtaining visas for \"a few dozen\" of his fellow-countrymen, but insisted he was acting for humanitarian reasons. </p> <p>Released on bail from Fleury-Merogis jail outside Paris in June last year, the singer staged a series of concerts in Kinshasa this July to thank his people for their support and to announce that, after 18 years in Europe, he planned to move back home. </p> <p>\"This legal problem is not yet resolved, but I am confident in the justice system and I'm sure they will prove me innocent,\" he said at the time.</p>",
  "<p>In recent months, as alarm bells have been ringing louder and louder over the cash crisis at Alitalia, the green, white and red Italian national carrier has kept up appearances, as far as possible. </p> <p>Despite urgent calls for a cash injection and warnings that Italy's \"Titanic\" will go under if the gaping holes in its bank account are not plugged, the company has resisted putting its ticket prices up. Sort of. </p> <p>Anyone brave or patriotic enough to buy a ticket in the hope that the company will still be in business on the date of travel has noticed a new extra charge in recent months: for those paying the airline by phone there is a \u20ac10 (\u00a36.77) fee for the \"emission of the ticket\" and \u20ac30 for those buying tickets through a travel agent. </p> <p>Whatever extra euros the company has been able to scrape back in its efforts to balance its books appear to have come too late. The Italian national air carrier is already history, according to many, well before yesterday's \"day of truth\". Italians have been referring sadly to their airline as Aliflop for several months now. </p> <p>Many have swung to new low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, easyJet and the two Italian counterparts, VolareWeb and Air One. Alitalia has lost 11% of its domestic passengers so far this year. </p> <p>Last week, union members suggested that as many as 7,000 jobs could go in the cuts. Managers say this is the only way to keep the airline in business, but the Italian media have lifted the curtain on what both sides of the political spectrum agree is the real reason: Alitalia has finally run out of money. </p> <p>The airline, which is 62% state-owned, has been losing money for years. It has been in the red for 10 of the past 11 years. So far this year it has lost a record \u20ac329m, which observers note works out to \u20ac1.8m per day. </p> <p>Where all efforts to save money on in-flight entertainment, catering and staff accommodation have failed the final drastic solution is to reduce the company's staff - many of whom are seen as expecting comfortable, but expensive working conditions by right - by nearly a third. </p> <p>The financial difficulties go back well beyond the arrival of the cheap and cheerful airlines that have transformed European travel in recent years. According to analysts, staff and politicians, Alitalia has been throwing money around for so long its day of reckoning was overdue. The only thing Italy's normally deeply entrenched political opponents cannot quite agree on is whether the staff or the bosses are to blame for the huge waste many believe deserves a place in the Guinness Book of Records. </p> <p>\"The 22,000 Alitalia staff are beginning to realise that playtime is really over,\" said left-leaning weekly Espresso magazine in its latest edition. \"For years they have managed to defend a party of privileges with tooth and nail,\" the magazine wrote. </p> <p>\"The staff in green jackets cost too much,\" the magazine added, pointing out that 20.98 % of Alitalia's budget goes on staff costs compared with 12.89% at easyJet, 16.07% at Ryanair and 10.21% at Volare. \"And they don't exactly do much in return.\" </p> <p>The magazine lists a dizzying \"Babel of benefits\", including a \u20ac1,200 bonus introduced temporarily to compensate staff made to fly in aircraft without sufficient sleeping space. According to Espresso, on January 5 last year, 11.6% of air stewards were off sick. On any given day this year, the magazine notes, the number of Alitalia staff off sick never goes below 8.4%. At competitor Volare, less than 3% of staff take sick leave each day. </p> <p>Espresso, though, blames bad management as much as the staff. \"Those who have run Alitalia in recent years should be banned from public office,\" the magazine declares. Besides the usual executive perks, in 1999 Espresso reported that the company had a Mexico City office, with 15 staff, even though flights to Mexico had stopped in 1985. </p> <p>Panorama, a weekly magazine which firmly backs Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right government, slammed the company for its \"job-for-life\" culture, and an expensive habit of handing out favours to friends in high places. One regular flyer noticed a number of people in the VIP lounge boasting their tickets had been upgraded by friends. </p> <p>Panorama also said Alitalia was one of the few European airlines whose pilots are collected at home and driven to the airport, whose travelling staff are accommodated in city centre hotels and often driven to work in fleets of half-empty coaches. The company spent \u20ac161m on catering and inflight entertainment, including its own airport-based chefs last year. </p> <p>Chief executive Giancarlo Cimoli, known as Diesel for his days as head of Italian state railways, has estimated \u20ac61m could be cut, without the food changing much, in the next year. </p> <p>The Italian state has long bailed out Alitalia, but the European Union has now said that it must stop. The company must be made to stand on its own or die. </p> <p>\"The Italian government has undertaken to privatise the company in the space of a year. They must draw up a plan that is acceptable to the private sector or they will have to close it down,\" the EU's transport commissioner Loyola de Palacio said at the weekend.</p>",

This is similar territory to The Outlaw Josey Wales, and the action is breathlessly exciting, but Lee focuses more on the relationships: the bond between the two; Jack's involvement with a young widow (played by the singer Jewel); and Jake's deepening friendship with former slave-turned-fighter Daniel (Jeffrey Wright).

  "<p>A massive asset sale by Shell that brought in $3.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in the first half of the year continued yesterday when the troubled oil group sold off some of its Egyptian interests for $235m. </p> <p>The 40% holding in the Rosetta concession - which is already producing gas in the Nile delta region - was to have been bought by Kuwaiti interests. Britain's BG stepped in, however, and exercised its pre-emption rights on the shares. </p> <p>Shell said Rosetta had limited synergies with the rest of its business in Egypt and raising cash this way enabled it to \"focus resources on higher-value opportunities\". </p> <p>The latest shake-out comes on top of disposals in Bangladesh, the United States and Angola this year. The company has traditionally sold off about $2bn worth of what it deemed lower-grade interests every year. </p> <p>But the crisis of confidence that hit Shell this year when it cut its proven reserve estimates by 20%, has triggered more vigorous action. The company increased its capital expenditure from $13bn a year to nearly $15bn this year. </p> <p>Some of this cash has gone on overspends in places such as the Nigerian Bonga field and Russia's Sakhalin project, but more money is also being pumped into new exploration and production. </p> <p>The reserves downgrade - which triggered the departure of its chairman of managing directors, Sir Philip Watts, and others - has turned the spotlight on Shell's poor record for replacing reserves. </p> <p>It has fallen behind its biggest rivals, BP and ExxonMobil, so is attempting to make up lost ground. </p> <p>The Middle East and north Africa are seen by all the oil companies as attractive for future business. Shell is at the forefront of efforts to open up Libya as well as the Western Desert in Egypt. </p> <p>But it is also a good time to sell assets because soaring global crude and gas prices have caused their value to increase. There are buyers around because oil companies are awash with cash. </p> <p>BG's managing director for Africa, Stuart Fysh, described the Rosetta purchase from Shell as \"an excellent opportunity\" to increase its position to 80% in a high-quality concession in which it is already an operator. </p> <p>The Rosetta concession has three development leases as well as a producing field which are at present the subject of negotiations with the Egyptian government. </p> <p>Shell is in the middle of a wide-ranging review of the future of the business and is due to outline a new strategy on September 22. In November it will give details of action over an even more critical issue: the future structure and governance of the company. </p> <p><strong>$3.5bn and counting...</strong></p> <p>Shell raised $3.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in the first half of 2004:</p> <p><strong>Bangladesh</strong> Upstream assets</p> <p><strong>United States</strong> Power assets, product pipelines, Delaware City Refinery, Teneska Power Company</p> <p><strong>Angola</strong> Block 18</p> <p><strong>Portugal</strong> Service stations and distribution assets </p> <p><strong>UK</strong> Some upstream assets</p> <p><strong>Germany</strong> A 5.27% interest in VNG downstream gas distribution company</p> <p><strong>Mexico</strong> Gas pipelines</p> <p><strong>China</strong> Shares in Sinopec </p> <p>Further sales since July 1:</p> <p><strong>Peru</strong> Divested service station network, industrial and local marine fuels business to Enap</p> <p><strong>Thailand</strong> Sold its 64% share in Rayong refinery</p> <p><strong>Spain</strong> Intention to sell retail and commercial businesses</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong> Sold 9.96% of the total shares in Showa Shell to Saudi Aramco</p> <p><strong>Egypt</strong> 40% stake in Rosetta concession to BG</p>",
  "The circus tent has gone from Beaumaris Green, its brilliant stripes no longer contrasting with the shining Menai Strait and the blue lift of the Carneddau summits beyond. The periodic rain squalls that swept along from Menai Bridge last month have been succeeded by the soft calm of earliest autumn. <p>As we climbed the russet sea cliffs above Ynys Dulas a single green sail dipped in the sunny swell offshore. High up on the grassy sward we could see the summit of Mynydd Eilian a mile to the west, the second highest Anglesey top. Rabbits darted in and out of the short bracken at our feet. We looked down to the empty bay called Porthygwichiaid, penultimate inlet of the island's east coast. Not only empty but silent and quite forlorn on this day when the sea spread to an uncertain horizon. As we pulled into view of the lighthouse at Point Lynas we espied vague, deep blue profiles away to the north - could they be the Manx Hills, confused with a complex of cloud and sky? </p> <p>Now the weather played its trump card. The clouds had gathered in the west and now the sun had completely disappeared. A dark gloom descended as we went along towards Llaneilian. The wind brought a dark ceiling over the margin of land and sea, the yellow, lichened cliffs near Amlwch turned to navy, then grey. The calls of gulls now seemed more like sirens of alarm. Looking back to the northern flank of Mynydd Eilian we saw nothing but a curtain of driven mist. The light had gone from the sky; then the rain slanted in from the menacing sea, drizzle at first but soon in wetting columns. It seemed that summer had ended at a single stroke.</p>",
  "The Croatian painter and politician Ivan Lackovic Croata, who has died aged 72, began to add the pseudonym \"Croata\" in 1964, when his country was part of Yugoslavia. As a \"naive\" artist from a peasant background, he became a hero of the socialist state while in his thirties. By this time he was already nursing strong nationalist feelings, which could not be fully expressed until Croatia gained its independence in 1992. There is a strong patriotic mood in all of his work, particularly in the vivid winter landscapes celebrating the beauty of his homeland for which he is best known. <p>Lackovic was born in Batinska, a village in the lush Drava valley, north-east of Zagreb. His parents Terezija and Vid had had little education, and their son left school to become a labourer at the age of 12. Soon, he began to paint on glass, a popular material in the folk art of the Balkans, as well as on the walls of neighbours' houses, using whitewash thinned with milk. </p> <p>His talents were discovered by Dragutin Ancic, a teacher, who took him to Zagreb in 1957. It was in the city's Gallery of Primitive Art that Lackovic first encountered the works of the Hlebine School, a group of naive painters in northern Croatia, led since 1932 by the charismatic Krsto Hegedusic. Lackovic's experience of their luminous rural scenes was an epiphany, and he moved to Zagreb shortly afterwards with his wife, Ana, and two-year-old son. </p> <p>Success was not immediate. Until 1968 Lackovic was a postman, but, after meeting Hegedusic in 1962, he began to attract more attention, having his first one-man show two years later, at the Yugoslav Academy of Arts and Sciences in Zagreb. </p> <p>Initially, Lackovic was recognised for his graphic art, at which he excelled. His book illustrations, prints and drawings - often biblical or mythological narratives, The Apocalypse, Nineveh, Eros and Thanatos - are bold, sometimes almost abstract, compositions. Such events as the deaths of stars become vibrant doodles, while Christian images are given the immediacy of a mystic vision. </p> <p> Lackovic's paintings, however, are less successful, often looking like faintly sinister Christmas cards: winter light gleams sickly through leafless trees while peasants throw snowballs or labour in the ice. Sometimes Pegasus drops by, all aflame, or a clump of brilliant blue flowers wildly sheds its blossom. Grotesque as they may be, such pictures undoubtedly expressed a sincere longing for, in Lackovic's words, a \"harmony of man and nature\". He added: \"I have given man a special place in nature, I have elevated him to the throne by making him part of nature itself ... The humans in my paintings are sustained by the melancholy colours of spring, summer, autumn and winter.\" </p> <p>This sympathy with the countryside also had a religious dimension. In 1969 Lackovic depicted a village laid like an offering on an altar, while in Man With A Rooster a peasant's journey across the snow, lit by the setting sun, is a metaphor for human mortality. </p> <p>Rather than seeming hopelessly out-of-date, Lackovic's work became even more relevant in the newly independent Croatia. Whatever the realities of modern life, Lackovic provided his compatriots with imagery that they could recognise not only as resolutely Catholic but also as distinctly Croatian. Moreover, in the 1990s such paintings as The Eyes Of Truth clearly referred to the sufferings caused by the Yugoslavian war. </p> <p>Lackovic's popularity was confirmed by his election, on two occasions, as a member of his country's recently established parliament. He was active politically and artistically right up to his sudden death - while bicycling at a sports centre in Zagreb. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Ana, and their children Ivan and Ivana. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Ivan Lackovic Croata, artist and politician, born January 1 1932; died August 29 2004</p>",
  "Warwick is not known as a hotspot for snowmobiling, especially on a sunny summer afternoon. But a Swedish man has received a ticket alleging his snowmobile was parked illegally in the city one day in June. Now he faces a fine of 1,211 kronor (\u00a390) . <p>Krister Nylander, who lives in the village of Bollstabruk, more than 200 miles north of Stockholm, says he has not left Sweden this year. Crucially, neither has his snowmobile. </p> <p>\"England doesn't have that much snow, does it?\" inquired Mr Nylander when contacted by telephone yesterday at his home. \"Particularly not in June. </p> <p>\"My snowmobile is parked in my barn. It has never left Sweden. I use it for recreation locally,\" he said. \"If I wanted to go on holiday with my snowmobile, I think I would go somewhere else where there is snow, like Finland.\" </p> <p>Mr Nylander, who is 32 and works as an engineer at a sewage and water treatment plant, is one among thousands of EU citizens who have been introduced to the delights of cross-border debt collection thanks to the technical ingenuity of a British company which specialises in recovering fines from foreign vehicles. </p> <p>The demand he received in the post was sent out by Euro Parking Collections (EPC), a London firm which acts as an agent for more than 40 local authorities across Europe, including six London boroughs. Mr Nylander's ticket was sent out on behalf of CP Plus, a company which manages car parks around Britain. </p> <p>EPC's website says it has been given the \"power of autorney\" - which sounds like a pun but may just be a spelling mistake - for the collection of parking fines, speeding tickets and bus lane infringements. Neither EPC nor CP Plus could be contacted yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Nylander said: \"To be fair, the letter had the right number plate, BPM 014, and the correct vehicle type, a Yamaha model. </p> <p>\"But I don't think anyone realised it was a snowmobile. My family have all smiled at it. I'm going to have to deny [the company] their money. I may frame the ticket.\" </p> <p>Mr Nylander said he had barely left his local county in which he lives in Sweden this year. He has only been to Britain once, as a schoolboy when 16. The ship he came on was scheduled to dock in Tilbury for two days but was stuck in the port for five due to a strike. </p> <p>\"We never made it to Warwick, even then,\" he added. \"But it wasn't that I didn't like Britain.\"</p>",
  "<p>The bones of a lost Mexican tribe from the baking sands of Baja California have begun to tell a new story of the peopling of the Americas. Orthodoxy has it that the first American colonists crossed the Bering Straits 12,000 years ago at the close of the last Ice Age. They were people of Mongoloid origin from the Siberian steppes, and they spread slowly from Alaska to Patagonia, and they were the ancestors of all native American tribes. And they were brachycephalic: that is, they tended to have short, wide skulls. </p> <p>But the Pericues, a people who went extinct in the 18th century, may tell a different story. Their skulls were dolicephalic: that is, long and thin. Other enigmatic evidence is beginning to emerge of an earlier settlement of America - perhaps as early as 30,000 years ago - by long-headed, seafaring people who may have crossed the Pacific by boat, migrating from island to island, until they reached the US Pacific coastline, Silvia Gonzalez of Liverpool John Moores University, told the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Exeter. </p> <p>\"They appear more similar to southern Asians, Australian and populations of the South Pacific rim than they do to northern Asians,\" she said. \"DNA analysis of the Mexican remains suggest that these people were at least partly contemporaneous to the first native American settlers on the continent. We think there were several migration waves into the Americas at different times by different human groups. The timing, route and point of origin of the first colonisation of the Americas remains the most contentious point in human evolution.\" </p> <p>The Pericues lived an isolated life as hunter-gatherers with stone tools: Jesuit missionaries recorded their existence before they disappeared altogether. Dr Gonzalez's study of the collected bones in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City is the first fruit of 11 projects investigating the role of environment in the evolution and dispersal of humanity, funded by Britain's natural environment research council. \"Diet, dating and dispersal and all of these areas are very new science and we are getting new results to answer questions. said Clive Gamble, of the University of Southampton \"We are interested in the response to climate change.\"</p>",
  "The shadow home secretary, David Davis, today dramatically pulled out of a launch event for a new book by immigration service whistleblower Steve Moxon, which is highly critical of Britain's ethnic minority communities. <p>Mr Davis was due to attend a lunchtime event to publicise the book entitled The Great Immigration Scandal, although Conservative Central Office had already denied that he would be \"chairing\" the event, as the invitations had stated.</p> <p>But with less than three hours to go, the shadow home secretary - who had championed Mr Moxon as a wronged whistleblower for his role in revealing lax visa checks for EU accession country applicants - withdrew from the event.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Davis said he \"respected Mr Moxon as a whistleblower\" but had not read the controversial book when he accepted the invitation.</p> <p>In the book, Mr Moxon goes some way to defending the British National party (BNP), attacks equal opportunity schemes for immigrants, ridicules the idea that immigrants make a net economic contribution and casually remarks that people should take \"extra caution\" in \"predominantly Afro-Caribbean areas or where blacks deal drugs or pimp girls\".</p> <p>Mr Davis publicly backed Mr Moxon when he was first suspended, then dismissed, from his job, and publishers Imprint Academic had claimed that Mr Davis would be chairing today's launch at the British Academy in London.</p> <p>The embarrassing U-turn will fuel Labour accusations that the Tory party has reverted to the \"attack dog\" mode of former leader William Hague, championing tabloid causes and chasing headlines without a detailed strategy of its own.</p> <p>At his book launch, Mr Moxon strenuously denied allegations of racism. \"Anyone who looks into my background will not find anything that can be misconstrued as racist,\" he told a press conference. </p> <p>He said Britain was suffering from a \"disease of political correctness\". He also compared Tony Blair with the former Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. </p> <p>\"There is not much actually that distinguishes Mussolini from Blair,\" he said. \"They have a shared idea of a third way which is much more rightwing in Blair's conceptions of it.\" </p> <p>The book's publisher, Keith Sutherland, said of Mr Davis' failure to attend: \"Unfortunately he appears to have been frightened off by the Independent article that was published this morning. His office have actually had a copy of the book for the best part of a month. </p> <p> \"The pretext that his office has given for pulling out of this is the rather strange claim that the book is in some way condoning another political party. Neither Steve nor the publisher have had any contact nor any interest in the activities of the BNP.\" </p> <p>Last night Simon Wolley, the director of Operation Black Vote, warned that the book was nothing more than a \"poisonous Islamophobic rant\" and that it would be \"political suicide\" for any party to associate itself with it.</p> <p>e said: \"A more racist, hate-filled book would be hard to find. Moxon's poisonous rant is designed to sow fear, terror and distrust between the white and ethnic communities.\"</p> <p>In the book, which deals at length with his sacking from his Sheffield job within the immigration and nationality directorate - and with it the resignation of the then immigration minister Beverley Hughes after she denied knowing about the affair on television - Mr Moxon describes \"nigger\" as an ironic term and also claims \"Paki\" is not necessarily derogatory. </p> <p>The 48-year-old claims an \"explosion\" of immigration could lead to civil war, and the mass of \"ordinary people\" driven to vote for the openly racist BNP.</p> <p>In a separate move today, Tory officials distanced themselves from proposals to bar low-earning migrants from settling in Britain. </p> <p>A report commissioned by the party suggests only highly-educated workers who earn at least \u00a325,000 a year would be allowed to live in Britain. But Conservative Central Office insisted this would never become party policy. </p> <p>The proposal comes in a report commissioned by the party. It was drawn up by an inquiry headed by former Tory immigration minister Timothy Kirkhope - now a Conservative MEP. </p> <p>The proposal would mean migrants would have to prove they have a good university degree and would be ineligible for state benefits so they do not become a burden on the taxpayer. </p> <p>The report said Britain was one of the most densely populated countries in the world and could not cope with extra people. However, a spokeswoman from Conservative Central Office said: \"This is just one of a number of suggestions made by the inquiry. But it is not Conservative party policy and it is not something we will be moving forward with.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's the first full day of term, a Monday with a temperature of 24C. The order of the day for the kids on their lunchbreak in north London is ice cream, ice lolly or ice pop. And chips. </p> <p>There are dozens of children spilling out of the local schools and onto Islington's Chapel Street Market and Upper Street and heading straight for their favoured eatery. Queues form quickly outside the newsagents and fast food bars. </p> <p>And there are a lot to chose from: Perfect Fried Chicken, Angel Kebab, Crown Fish and Chip Bar, Star Burger and, king of them all, McDonalds. </p> <p>McDonalds is heaving. Forty-odd children clamber in haphazard queues for their chicken McNugget, Happy Meal or Big Mac. More have already taken a seat and are munching away, while outside a couple finish a Benson &amp; Hedges before heading inside. In today's heat it might be the cool air conditioning that lures them in, but from a distance it looks like habit is the overriding factor. </p> <p>Akkas, the manager of the Perfect Fried Chicken shop says he will probably serve a combination of chicken and chips to around 15 children today. For him the holidays are quieter. But even during term time, his business is light compared to that of the fast food giant, McDonalds. \"They don't always come here,\" he says. \"They prefer McDonalds.\" </p> <p>Most of the school kids drifting in and out of Akkas' shop will opt for a special \"kids meal\" he puts on: chicken and chips. It's not actually that different from the normal chicken and chips serving, just cheaper at \u00a31.30. \"It's for the kids, we normally charge \u00a31.75. It's a bit smaller, but it's just designed for their needs. It's affordability that matters for them.\" He sells lots of diet coke on the side. </p> <p>The business from the school children is good, and Akkas doesn't mind the streams of children, unlike other shops, there's no sign on the door permitting only two at a time. \"They are always polite, but they are mostly girls. Girls don't make any trouble,\" he confides.</p> <p>Chapel Street Market was buzzing at 1pm today despite it being the stallholders' day off. A plethora of fast food outlets, bakeries and chip shops are doing thriving trade to not only the school pupils but other Islington residents and workers too. The queue for a sandwich and orange juice at Marks &amp; Spencer's is as big as the one in McDonald's, just a little more ordered. In the Guardian's canteen ten minutes walk away 90kg of chips will be consumed this week. </p> <p>Perhaps on a day when the market's stalls are up and running the pupils prefer a bag or nuts, an orange and a banana to the cones of chips. But today there was only one pupil holding an apple, with an apple Tango in the other hand. None of the pupils opted for the \u00a32.95 eat-as-much-as-you-can vegetarian restaurant where the walls are plastered with vegan propaganda. </p> <p>Hitesh, the owner of the Market News newsagent says he serves around 50 school children a day. \"You can see what they buy,\" he says pointing to the 10p sweet shelf that is nearly empty after the lunchtime rush. Chocolate, canned drinks and crisps are all on their wish lists but today, as the Indian summer continues, the ice creams are in particular demand. </p> <p>Some days Hitesh gets asked for cigarettes too. \"They ask - I of course I never give them any,\" he pauses and adds: \"You only make 10p on a packet of cigarettes, but if I were caught selling them I would be fined \u00a35,000.\"</p> <p>He agrees with the findings of a BBC poll today where 80% asked advocated the age at which young people are allowed to buy cigarettes being raised to 18. \"It's a good idea,\" he says. \"It would certainly make it easier for me to know who I shouldn't be selling them to.\"</p> <p>But he's happy to sell sweets - and has no problem with his own kids munching on Wham bars and sugar necklaces. To put it simply, he says: \"It makes them happy.\"</p>",
  "The US presidential election is anything but a national event. Instead, 50 individual states vote for the president, and only a handful of those really matter. <p>Some states vote solidly for the Democratic candidate (California, New York), and some for the Republican (Texas, Georgia). No candidate wastes too much time or money on preaching to the converted. </p> <p>Even in the battleground states, every dollar a candidate spends once he has secured more than 50% of the vote is a wasted dollar. The winner takes all the electoral votes, whether he wins by one vote or one million. </p> <p>The number of electoral votes a state receives is based on its population, making California the largest with 55 electoral votes. Seven states, and the District of Columbia, qualify for the minimum of three. </p> <p>The magic number of electoral votes needed to win the White House is 270. Setting aside misleading national percentages (remember, Al Gore won in straight percentage terms in 2000), George Bush and John Kerry seem evenly matched in the electoral college. Pollster Charlie Cook gives Kerry 207 electoral votes and Bush 211, with 120 up for grabs. </p> <p>Depending on which pollster you listen to, there are as many as 20 or as few as three battleground states. The candidates will be particularly active in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, because these states have the most electoral votes to offer among the undecided bloc. </p> <p>With the race incredibly close, the independent candidate Ralph Nader may trip Kerry up, but still needs to make it onto the ballots in some key states. A court in Pennsylvania has already ruled that he will not be listed as a candidate there.</p> <p>Pollster John Zogby lists 20 swing states, while Cook believes just 10 are too close to call. John Kerry's campaign has bought ad time in 20 states between now and November 2, meaning he considers all of them to be up for grabs. </p> <p>The following twenty states have the closest races (electoral votes in parentheses):</p> <p>Bush won <b>Arizona (10) </b> fairly decisively in 2000, but a mid-August poll by the Behaviour Research Centre, based in Phoenix, showed Kerry gaining ground. Bush still led Kerry 46% to 41%, but a huge 13% of voters remained undecided. </p> <p>Cook lists <b>Arkansas (6)</b> as a \"likely\" Bush win, but Zogby is not so sure. The Kerry campaign has targeted Arkansas for its pre-election advertising spend. </p> <p><b>Colorado (9)</b> voted for Bush in 2000 and leans towards him now, but Kerry has targeted the state for an advertising blitz during the final weeks of the campaign.</p> <p>The biggest prize among the undecided states is <b>Florida (27)</b>, which chose Bush in 2000 - with a little help from the supreme court - by the razor-thin margin of 527 votes. </p> <p><b>Iowa (7)</b> went to Gore in 2000. By August 26, Gallup still had Kerry leading Bush by 51% to 45%, with Nader trailing at 2%. </p> <p>Cook says <b>Michigan (17)</b> leans toward Kerry, and Gore won here last time. </p> <p>Even with Nader taking 5% of the vote in 2000, Gore still won <b>Minnesota (10)</b>. However, Bush could win here - polls show that neither he nor Kerry has a real lead. </p> <p>A Zogby poll from August 25 showed <b>Missouri (11)</b> being too close to call, with the candidates running just tenths of a percentage point apart. </p> <p>A mid-August poll for the Reno Gazette-Journal showed a statistical tie in <b>Nevada (5)</b>, which went to Bush in 2000. </p> <p>Bush just squeaked ahead in <b>New Hampshire (4) </b>at the last election, although the state may feel well disposed to a fellow New Englander in Kerry. However, at the moment it is too close to call. </p> <p>Gore won <b>New Mexico (5)</b> by a small margin in 2000, and the race for the state is still very close. </p> <p><b>North Carolina (15)</b> leans toward Bush - but this is John Edwards' home state, and the Kerry campaign intends to spend heavily to turn things around. </p> <p>A Gallup poll taken in mid-August confirmed that <b>Ohio (20)</b> will be a key battleground state. Neither candidate has managed a lead, Nader is running at 4%, and another 4% declare themselves to be undecided. </p> <p>In 2000, Gore won <b>Oregon (7)</b> by a whisker, with 46.9% of the vote to Bush's 46.5%. Nader took a hefty 5%. Cook believes the state is leaning towards Kerry. </p> <p><b>Pennsylvania (21)</b> went to Gore in 2000, but only just. The August 26 Gallup poll had Bush and Kerry neck and neck on 47%, with Nader at 2%, and 4% undecided. </p> <p>Cook lists <b>Tennessee (11)</b> as \"likely Bush\" after Gore famously lost his own home state in the 2000 election, but Zogby feels it could still go either way. The Kerry campaign doesn't seem to be holding out much hope - it's not one of the 20 states where they have bought ad time. </p> <p>Bush will win <b>Virginia (13)</b>, Cook believes, and Kerry has not pre-bought ad time in the state. </p> <p><b>Washington (11)</b> will probably go to Kerry, says Cook, and the Republicans haven't won a presidential vote here since Ronald Reagan did so in 1984. Bush has been targeting the state, but Kerry has not been complacent, allocating money for late-campaign advertising. </p> <p>Democrats outnumber Republicans by two to one in <b>West Virginia (5)</b>, but Bush took the state in 2000. Both Bush and Kerry campaigned here over the Labour Day holiday weekend, with polls showing the candidates running neck and neck. </p> <p><b>Wisconsin (10)</b> went to Gore in 2000, but the August 26 Gallup poll put Bush slightly ahead at 48%, with 45% preferring Kerry. Given the 5% margin of error, neither candidate had a real lead, while Nader had a potentially significant 4% of the vote.</p>",
  "<p>For too many students, getting into debt is as much a part of university as cramming for exams and drinking pound a pint lager. The rising cost of studying coupled with many parents' inability to foot the entire bill up front mean that a lot of freshers will already have racked up some debt by the end of their first year at university. But while debt may be inevitable for many, keeping the cost of borrowing down is both essential and manageable.</p> <p>Annabel Brodie-Smith, director of the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) says: \"Many young people go to university to enjoy some of the best years of their life but at the end of three years find themselves deeply in debt.\" The AITC's research has shown that students and parents alike fail to appreciate the full cost of higher education. \"Students expect their parents to fund them, when in actual fact, less than a third of parents say they are in a position to do so,\" says Ms Brodie-Smith.</p> <p>It's important to be clear about your finances from the start. \"Work out a budget,\" says Gill Cardy, an independent financial adviser. \"For many, this is the first experience of living alone, being totally responsible for food costs, utility bills and so on. You may not have a realistic idea of the figures involved.\"</p> <p>The National Union of Students (NUS) estimates the average course costs for the 39-week academic year 2004/5 at \u00a32,100 for students inside London, and \u00a31,734 for those living elsewhere. This figure includes tuition fees (\u00a31,150) money for books and equipment (\u00a3132: \u00a3315 for London) and travel (\u00a3438: \u00a3621 for London). Added to that are actual living costs, estimated at \u00a38,086 for Londoners and \u00a36,850 for the rest of the country. The largest outgoing in this section is rent, estimated at \u00a32,146 (\u00a32,989 for London). Food comes in third at \u00a31,103 (\u00a31,247 for London). Beating it into second place is the \"leisure\" category, allocated \u00a31,440 across the board. So all those happy people heading off to university will have to find around \u00a310,186 for their first year if they are heading to a London university, \u00a38,584 if they're off to study in another part of the country. </p> <p>Bearing in mind that parental contribution cannot always be counted on, and given that a student's earning power is usually quite limited, the next port of call is generally a student loan. Gavin Greig, from the Student Loans Company, says \"A student loan is in effect interest-free, because the interest is based on the Retail Price Index (RPI). So this year it's 2.6%, while last year it was 3.1%. Compared with the rates at a high street bank or on a visa card, which might be 18.9%, that's really very good\". </p> <p>But while Ms Cardy agrees that student loans are a good option, she cautions against getting carried away. It can be difficult to get to grips with the fact that you will have to live on that money for a whole term. \"Try simple techniques to control your spending - maybe take out your week's money in one go and then don't let yourself take out any more,\" she says, although having that wad of cash around on the first day creates a temptation to overspend that will require discipline to avoid. </p> <p>Joanna O'Brien, from the financial website Moneyfacts, says: \"It might be worth putting that lump sum into a savings account rather than your current account. For example, Intelligent Finance offers an instant access account at a reasonable rate.\"</p> <p>However, the NUS calculates that, after student loans, the average student still faces a cost of living shortfall of about \u00a35,513 (\u00a36,399). </p> <p>There are a number of options available to make up the difference, but it's important to choose carefully to get the best deal. It's also important not to get carried away. We all know how easy it is to develop an \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" attitude to getting into debt, but one day you will have to pay it all back - with interest. </p> <p>Interest-free overdrafts on student current accounts can offer something of a fallback, but make sure you pick the right one. \"It's staggering how many people choose an account because their parents have it,\" says Gill Cardy, \"Many accounts offer interest-free overdrafts which can be a useful and cheap way to borrow money. </p> <p>If you do plan to use your interest-free overdraft, Joanna O'Brien says: \"Ask exactly how much is interest-free and whatever you do, don't go into unauthorised overdraft.\" If you go over your limit, you could be faced with big charges. Keep an eye on the amount you can borrow interest-free as you may find that interest kicks in at a much lower level than you think.</p> <p>Remember too, that as a student you shouldn't pay tax on interest paid on your balance when you're in the black. Gill Cardy explains: \"The default position is that interest on a bank or building society account is calculated with the 20% income tax already deducted. As non-taxpayers this shouldn't happen to most students, so make sure you have filled in the Inland Revenue's R85 form to claim exemption.\" </p> <p>It's common sense that running up credit card bills is not a good idea when your income is limited, but if you must have a credit card, the first thing to do is to look at the APR. \"Some places offer student credit cards, \" says Joanna O'Brien, \"which can be useful if you can't get a card from anywhere else. But if you can, bear in mind that student cards generally don't offer the best rates of interest.\" </p> <p>Moneyfacts.co.uk can give you a good idea of the lowest APR rates available, or the best balance transfer offers if you're switching from another card. In that instance, \"cut up your original card\" implores Gill Hardy. Although, these finer points are missed if you then start running up bills on both cards.</p> <p>As for store cards, steer clear. \"I certainly wouldn't recommend store cards in any form,\" says Joanna O'Brien, \"they are so expensive. You could be looking at an APR of 31%.\"</p> <p>The debt students face already is substantial: according to the NUS, since most students take out a student loan (which could be over \u00a314,814 in London) and are almost certain to supplement that with other borrowing, those starting a course in 2004 could face a debt of \u00a316,294 on graduation. When increased tuition fees are introduced in 2006, friendly society the Children's Mutual suggests it will add \u00a35,550 to that final debt.</p> <p>While the Association of Graduate Recruiters found the average graduate starting salary this year is \u00a321,100, Gill Cardy warns against assuming that you will have plenty of money to pay back your loans once you graduate: \"Your lifestyle adjusts and so do your needs. You may need expensive clothes for work. Your rent is likely to be higher.\" </p> <p>But by borrowing sensibly you can minimise the pain. And if you do get in trouble, don't be tempted to ignore it. Dodging your rent, failing to make repayments or pay utility bills and so on could mean you run the risk of getting a county court judgement, which could make things difficult for you later. If you're in more debt than you can handle, seek advice. \"Most student unions have counselling services,\" says Gill Cardy. \"You don't have to suffer in silence.\"</p>",
  "<p>I first saw him, many years ago now, staring out with an uncanny gaze of blank intensity from the pages of a newspaper. Seated alone on a bench, immune to the endless motion of the airport around him, there was a curious inscrutability to his slight, balding yet dignified countenance. He looked like some unlikely cross between a Zen master and Chaplin's Tramp. He had these amazing long brows, as dark as his hooded eyes, and a small, perfectly groomed moustache perched on top of his upper lip. It was like a caricature of a face, five charcoal marks on a canvas. But strangely noble, too. </p> <p>His name was Merhan Karimi Nasseri though he called himself \"Sir Alfred\". He lived in a lost dimension of absurd bureaucratic entanglement. That is to say, on a bench in Terminal One of the Charles de Gaulle International Airport, and he had lived there since 1988. For a series of insanely complicated reasons, the Iranian-born refugee was now a man without a country - or any other documented, internationally accepted identity status. Alfred couldn't leave France because he did not have papers; he couldn't enter France because he did not have papers. The authorities told him to wait in the airport lounge while they sorted the paradox out. That he did - for years and years. </p> <p>Then one day, I heard that Alfred had finally been given his papers. He was free to go anywhere in the world he wished. Except now it seemed he didn't want to leave the airport after all. It was the only home - the only past - he had left. </p> <p>I woke up that night burning with an idea for a movie about Alfred - co-starring Alfred himself. I counted the hours before I could hit my desk and get started on the script. To me, his unlikely nightmare was nothing less than one of the quintessential tales of our lonely, displaced, increasingly unreal age. </p> <p>Perhaps I was a little overexcited, but I soon found that I was not the only one inspired by Alfred's true story. Every screenwriter in London seemed to have a version of his life in the drawer somewhere. And every single one (except mine) was a romantic comedy with a happy ending. None of the others had been made, nor would they ever be. Because word was out that over at DreamWorks, Steven - the Steven - was interested in the story. In sunny faraway LA, the big boys were preparing to immortalise Sir Alfred. </p> <p>Meanwhile, down at the other end of the world cinematic digestive system, my friend Glen Luchford and I grabbed a DV camera and a few changes of clothes and drove overnight to meet Alfred in the airport. Fittingly, days turned into months and we ended up spending close to a year with him shooting our low budget, arthouse feature, Here to Where (2001). If you've seen it, I probably know you. </p> <p>Recently, Alfred has been back in the news again. Spielberg's latest, The Terminal, starring Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, is playing on thousands of screens around the world. Media everywhere is asking the same old question. Who is Alfred? No one has a clue. Alfred least of all, it seems. That is exactly how he wants it - I have spent enough time with him to know that. He has been in the airport for 16 years now. I suppose my fantasy upon first meeting Alfred back in the summer of 2000 was that I would be the one to save him. Where friendly lawyers, concerned doctors, crusading refugee groups and assorted praying Christians had failed, I would succeed. I would be the one to convince him to finally leave the airport. </p> <p>He lived in the basement shopping mall of Terminal One. The circular main building was a triumph of avant-garde airport design when it opened in 1974, but its swank jet-age days were long gone. Alfred's red bench was the only anchor in his life. It was his bed, living room and corporate headquarters. It was actually two benches pushed together, about eight feet long in total and gently curved, just about wide enough to sleep on if he kept his hands tucked under the pillow. (Alfred did have a pillow - and sheets - that he carefully laid down when he turned in for the night.) But he never slept during the day, though his eyes would often droop out of boredom; you could always find Alfred sitting in the middle of his bench, in front of a rickety, white Formica table, which he employed as a desk. </p> <p>From this perch, Alfred would survey his world. The display windows of an electronics store were across a corridor to his left; he could see the back of a newsagent's to the right. If he moved to one side of his bench, he could gaze across to a MacDonald's on the outer ring of the level. If he moved to the other, there were the shuttered doors of the misleadingly named Hotel Cocoon. </p> <p>Stacked around the back of the bench were boxes, suitcases and plastic bags containing everything Alfred owned in the world. This included: an extensive archive of newspaper, magazine and TV reports about himself; a rather large library donated by friendly passengers with lousy taste; giant files of postcards and letters from well-wishers around the world; his dry cleaning; a vast collection of McDonald's straws and - most tantalisingly - a diary which recorded in apparently exacting detail every day of his bizarre existence since he first appeared at Terminal One. </p> <p>Sitting next to Alfred I tried to get into the rhythm of his airport life. It was punctuated every other minute by three chimes heralding the flight announcements, that exotic mantra of foreign destinations that practically drove me mad by the end of my first day there. But Alfred had evolved in his strange habitat; he was able to tune them out. Life in the airport followed a masterplan, designed and controlled by some far off power. Waves of passengers came and went, the same patterns of humanity every hour, every day - the tide would bring in the Japanese in the early morning, the Africans would wash past the bench late at night. </p> <p>Many passers-by recognised Alfred; some had even made a special pilgrimage to meet him, first or last stop on their Paris tour. Even those who had never heard of him seemed to sense that this was no ordinary passenger. He provoked pity in all of them but Alfred certainly didn't see it that way. He had an extremely high opinion of himself. And besides, as he would quickly remind you, his situation was only \"temporary\". </p> <p>During Alfred's first years in the airport, his basic needs were supplied by sympathetic passers-by and airport workers who knew of his Kafkaesque situation. People bought him food, gave him money and listened with sympathy to his tale. But by the time I met him, Alfred had developed a more retail approach to survival. Now he preferred to engage with the professionals of the media, people like me. In return for a few exclusive hours of his stream of consciousness tale, Alfred would graciously accept a small gratuity. The constant stream of journalists and film-makers passing through provided more than enough to keep him going. </p> <p>And yet from the moment I sat down next to him I felt the force of his - there is no better word - dignity. Alfred seemed totally content within himself. He did not aim to please or play on your sympathy. He was not the homeless guy on the tube singing for a drink. Everything in Alfred's life was conducted on his own terms. In some sense he was a freer man than most. </p> <p>Despite outward appearances, Alfred lived a life of total self-sufficiency and order. He kept himself meticulously clean and groomed, using a nearby airport bathroom. He hung his freshly dry-cleaned clothes from the handle of a suitcase next to his bench. He always ate a MacDonald's egg and bacon croissant for breakfast and a McDonald's fish sandwich for dinner. (Perhaps one day McDonald's will have the wit to sign Alfred up for a celebrity endorsement.) He always left a tip. Alfred was not, to put it bluntly, a bum. </p> <p>Still, I felt sorry for him - how could I not? Because one thing was never made quite clear in all the reports about Alfred: just how far gone he was. When he got talking about politics or the economy you could sense the remnants of a fine mind. But when he turned to his past you were dragged into the labyrinth of Alfred's fragile mental state. All the stories he had ever told over the years, all the articles ever written about him, were jumbled together in his head to produce a narrative that changed from day to day. The more you pressed him, the more absurd his supposed memories would become until he would suddenly stop short and fall silent. There seemed to be something in his past that he needed to forget. </p> <p>It was very frustrating. He once spent a week insisting to me that he was really Swedish. But his most consistent story, as far as I could piece it together, went like this: </p> <p>After his physician father's death in 1972, his family summoned him with the news that he was illegitimate. His real mother was, in fact, Scottish. (Looking at him, this seemed unlikely.) His family rejected him and Alfred left home to study Yugoslav economics in northern England. (This, amazingly, turned out to be true.) He returned to Iran in 1974 and got caught up in anti-Shah demonstrations. Arrested and tortured by Savak, the Iranian ministry of security, Alfred was stripped of his Iranian nationality and expelled. He spent the next years roaming through Europe in a search for asylum. Finally, in 1981, Belgium granted him refugee status and identity documents. That should have been a happy ending, of sorts. </p> <p>Instead, soon afterwards Alfred was robbed of his documents or - according to another version - sent them back to the authorities in what he called \"a moment of folly\". He left Belgium for France where he spent the next years in and out of jail on illegal immigration charges. Apparently, he tried to return to England but was turned back at Heathrow. It was at this point, in 1988, that he first settled into his limbo waiting for papers in Terminal One. A prominent lawyer took on Alfred's case and fought a 10-year legal battle to win him identity documents and the right to travel. But then Alfred refused to leave the airport. </p> <p>If nothing changed, he would die on his red bench. </p> <p>It seems very naive to me now, but I hoped that the making of Here to Where would somehow provide the catalyst for Alfred to reclaim a \"normal\" existence. It was the story of Paul Hugo, a selfish and incompetent American director (played by me, naturally) who goes to Paris to make a fiction film about Alfred's life. Along the way, Hugo's own life falls apart; his producer and crew turn on him, his main actor quits, his girlfriend leaves him and shooting grinds to a halt. The arrogant young man changes from using Alfred to identifying with him. Hugo redirects all his frantic energies to saving him - or what he thinks will save him. My plan was that the last scene would see Alfred and I leave the airport together both on film and in real life. </p> <p>It didn't exactly work out like that. For one thing, Alfred wasn't going anywhere, despite all my best efforts. Otherwise, our script took over reality or perhaps it was vice versa - I wasn't sure after a while. My friend Glen and I were at each other's throats, the crew was in revolt, my girlfriend left me, the money ran out. Only Alfred kept his cool, looking on with his usual Zen-like detachment. </p> <p>The last day of filming was an emotional one for me. My character Paul Hugo had spent the night in the airport sleeping on the floor next to Alfred. Early the next morning they were in the airport bathroom, looking into the mirror at themselves, shaving. Nothing had worked out as I hoped. I felt we had failed Alfred in every way. </p> <p>\"I'm worried about what's going to happen to you,\" my character said. He was still trying to get Alfred to leave the airport, though I had long given up. </p> <p>\"I followed my identification,\" Alfred replied. \"But you've been doing that a long time, right?\" \"Yes, it takes longer,\" he said. \"I know, but nothing has changed.\" \"Many things have changed.\" \"But you're still here, Alfred, right? You're still at the airport.\" \"Yes,\" he replied, carefully grooming his moustache. \"One of the airport's passengers. I'm always a passenger. If I go, I come back again. I'm not wandering. I don't wander.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, Alfred turned his back on me and walked out of the bathroom. I broke down in tears - me, not Paul Hugo. Like everyone else, we had used him and were about to walk away. What did he truly understand about our intentions - about the cynical real world beyond his bench? </p> <p>Alfred walked up to Glen in the corridor outside the bathroom. </p> <p>\"How did I do?\" he asked. </p> <p>Last week I flew to meet Alfred, three years since I last saw him. His noble Persian face lit up when he recognised me, but then it always does when he first sees a reporter. We shook hands. He seemed quite content. </p> <p>\"I am famous now,\" was the first thing he said to me. </p> <p>That was the only thing that mattered to him any more. Not his family or friends, not his past or future - only the archive of articles about a wasted life and a poster advertising Spielberg's film which he proudly hung from a suitcase next to his bench. \"Life is waiting,\" went the Hollywood ad slogan. </p> <p>Alfred was thrilled about The Terminal, though he would never get a chance to see it. He was looking forward to the Oscars. I didn't want to shatter his daydreams by telling him what a load of puerile crap Spielberg's movie was. I doubt he would have believed me anyway. \"Yes, my interest in America has gone up because of movie,\" Alfred said. \"That is very good.\" </p> <p>Apparently Alfred had received a cheque of several hundred thousand dollars for his life story. It had been deposited in the airport's Post Office bank. But Alfred had never cared much about money. He was now under the impression that DreamWorks was going to get him a passport and take him to California. Spielberg was going to come to his rescue; Tom Hanks was going to visit him at his bench. In fact, publicity material for the film didn't mention Alfred at all; they were distancing themselves from his depressing story. It wasn't exactly a happy Hollywood ending. </p> <p>I asked him if he had heard from any friends or family since I last saw him. He grabbed an old Toronto Globe and Mail article from one of his suitcases. \"It says that my relation has elapsed. Cut off. In this phase, I am without parents.\" I looked at the article. \"He has taken to saying he has no parents at all,\" it said. </p> <p>Alfred looked away from me for a moment. \"He denied me. Not his son.\" He turned back to watch me write notes. He seemed pleased. \"In 1968 they denied me, said I was not their son, so I left country. My parents, I suppose, are Americans. If Clark Gable says he's my father - I don't accept unless he has documents to prove.\" </p> <p>One of the strangest things about Alfred's situation is that no one from his past has ever come forward. It is as if he had never existed before the day he was first spotted in the airport. Perhaps all of us intrigued by Alfred's story preferred it that way. </p> <p>But once I decided to solve the mystery of who he really was, his acquaintances and family were surprisingly easy to find. </p> <p>Alfred had four brothers and two sisters, all of them middle-class people who lived in Tehran, except for one sister who was a dentist in Luxembourg. One worked in a bank, another was a chemist, another worked for state television and radio. Their father, Abdelkarim, was a physician who worked for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Masjed Suleiman, the birthplace of the Iranian oil industry - just like Alfred had always said. After he retired from the oil company, Abdelkarim moved the family to Tehran. He died in 1967 of cancer when Alfred was 22. </p> <p>It seems the family had known for a long time about Alfred's plight. They were a very well educated family, knew the west well, and read newspapers from abroad. But they apparently always believed that Alfred was living the life he wanted, that he had some kind of master plan. </p> <p>Alfred's closest relative was his brother, Cyrus, who was two years older than him. In their youth, the two boys seemed to have an idyllic childhood in Masjed Suleiman. \"He was close to me and we usually had the same friends,\" he said. \"We were mostly together. We had a good life. I liked swimming and Merhan used to play table tennis. He was very good at it.\" </p> <p>Cyrus was a businessman who imported surgical supplies into Iran. He knew England well. He and his wife, Mina, had lived and worked there for many years. Their son still did. Cyrus was, in fact, responsible for Alfred attending university in Bradford. He was very reluctant to talk, at first. The family thought that Alfred's problem was still only one of papers - and they worried that speaking to me might cause their lost brother problems with the authorities. It seems that the family had no idea of Alfred's fragile mental state. </p> <p>Alfred had lived with Cyrus and Mina for a time in London before moving into a flat of his own. They also lived upstairs from him in Tehran after they got married. At the time he was living with his mother. So Mina knew Alfred - or Merhan, as she scolded me when I used his new name - well. And the portrait both she and her husband painted of him couldn't be more different from the man now sitting on his bench in Terminal One. \"What can I say, he was very normal in every way,\" she said. In every way? She laughed charmingly. \"He was a good-looking man. Some of my friends wanted to be his wife or girlfriend. He had very normal relations with girls. But Merhan chose his own life and I guess it was not a family one.\" </p> <p>We agreed that Merhan was a very intelligent man. \"He was an intellectual. He spent all his time studying and reading books and listening to the radio,\" Mina said. \"He talked all the time about politics. He read books on politics all day and night. It was very important to him. And then he started to do what he believed in.\" </p> <p>One of the key parts of Alfred's story was always his arrest and torture by Savak because of his opposition to the Shah, followed by his deportation to Europe. Cyrus was reluctant to talk about this aspect of Alfred's life. But doing a bit more digging through sources in Iran, I was able to find out what really happened. </p> <p>Apparently, Alfred participated in a student strike at Tehran University in 1970 to object to a new university regulation. Things started to get out of hand and Savak got involved. They questioned all the students and gathered up the ringleaders, about 20, including Alfred. After a few hours of questioning in a university classroom, the matter was apparently dropped. This was evidently Alfred's only serious problem with the security services. </p> <p>There was no arrest, no torture, no confiscation of his passport and no deportation. It was not nearly as dramatic a story as Alfred now remembered. But he must have been scared. He certainly never forgot the incident. </p> <p>The last time Cyrus and Mina saw Alfred was in 1976 when their son was born in England. Alfred had abandoned his studies in Bradford, apparently because his money had run out, according to Mina. (Actually, according to fellow students and teachers I spoke to, Alfred failed his course. They had all wondered what a young Iranian was doing in England studying Serbo Croatian.) </p> <p>He left England to travel through Europe. For a while, he kept in touch, but then his letters stopped coming. With the revolution and then the war with Iraq, his family back home had their own problems to deal with. After four years without any contact, they went to the Foreign Ministry to ask for help trying to find him. \"But we could not find any sign of him,\" said Cyrus. </p> <p>Then in 1991, a family friend came upon Alfred at his bench in the airport. Amazed to find him after all that time, the friend went up to greet him. But Alfred wouldn't acknowledge that he knew him. The same thing happened on other occasions to other family and friends who tried to make contact with him. Finally they stopped trying. Was he ashamed of what he had become? Did the studious boy who loved politics consider himself a failure? Is that why he distanced himself from friends and family? </p> <p>\"Why did he say in the newspaper that his family rejected him?\" asked Mina. \"We do not understand that. That was not true. We thought this was the way he wanted to live. Everyone has his own life and he was going on in his own way. That's what we thought.\" </p> <p>But I was curious - there were still things I wanted to know. The Alfred I knew was mentally ill. Had there ever been signs of it when he was younger? \"No, no, not at all!\" said Mina. \"If there is something wrong with him now, it's not from the past. It must have happened to him there.\" This supported what Alfred's lawyer had said to me. He had arrived sane at the airport. At some point along the way - no one knew quite when - Alfred tipped over into madness. His life was indeed ruined by the absurdities of bureaucracy. </p> <p>And what of Alfred's mother? It turns out that she died only four years ago - at the very time I was filming Here to Where. She knew all about what had happened to her son. And according to Cyrus and Mina, she couldn't understand why he insisted on saying that she was not his mother. It was the great sadness of her life. \"He came from me,\" she told her other children. \"Why does he say that?\" Alfred doesn't know that she is dead. Cyrus is planning to fly to Paris next month to see his long lost brother. Perhaps Alfred's long journey still has another unlikely twist.</p>",

  "Brad Johnston was planning to spend today's Labor Day holiday cruising to the Bahamas with his young family. Instead, he will spend the day picking up the pieces of his 26ft motor cruiser shattered by the 105mph winds of Hurricane Frances. <p>The huge and powerful storm that had threatened 15 million people along Florida's east coast for two days finally came ashore early yesterday, the 75-mile wide eye passing directly over the Treasure Coast town of Stuart, where Mr Johnston's yacht was moored. </p> <p>It was forced from its moorings by the huge waves thrown up by Hurricane Frances and smashed into the quayside, shattering the bow and letting in seawater that flooded the boat's interior and ruined everything inside. </p> <p>\"I guess we were lucky,\" Mr Johnston said. \"At least we have our home.\" </p> <p>The category two hurricane, the second natural disaster to strike Florida in three weeks following Hurricane Charley's ravaging of the west coast, was still raging last night, making it difficult for emergency officials to assess the extent of the damage and destruction. </p> <p>But with the backend of the hurricane threatening more than 30cm (12 inches) of rain over much of the state, and widespread flooding predicted, President George Bush had already declared four counties a disaster zone, freeing up millions of dollars in federal aid for the thousands of people likely to be left homeless. </p> <p>The giant hurricane,1,000 miles wide at its peak, caused the evacuation of 2.5 million residents, the largest such operation in Florida's history. </p> <p>Officials from the state's electricity provider, Florida Power and Light, estimated that up to 4 million residents were left without power. For those unable to return to their homes, help was on the way. More than 6,000 National Guardsmen were due to be deployed and the American Red Cross, which operated 233 emergency shelters statewide during the storm, announced its biggest disaster relief operation, costing twice the $81m (\u00a346m) spent after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. </p> <p>Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, said that aid organisations expected to serve more than a million hot meals a day and that hundreds of lorries were on standby to bring food, water and bags of ice to areas most in need once conditions allowed. </p> <p>\"We won't be waiting for blue skies to react, but we will wait until we can do it safely,\" said Craig Fugate, Florida's director of emergency management. </p> <p>Almost 100,000 people chose to sit out the storm in emergency shelters and last night many were being urged to stay put because conditions outside were still considered to be too dangerous, although no deaths or serious injuries were reported in Florida. </p> <p>\"I've never seen a storm anything like it,\" said Mr Johnston, a 42-year-old marine engineer. \"It's so intense. There's so much rain and wind and it's just going on and on.\" </p> <p>Many people were angry and frustrated that Frances had stuck around so long. The storm ambled across from the Bahamas on Friday afternoon, where it was blamed for two deaths, and seated itself just off Florida's south-east coast, churning away overhead like a giant washing machine for more than 48 hours before resuming its westward crawl towards the state late on Saturday. </p> <p>\"It's painstakingly slow,\" said Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Centre. \"You could be in the eye for 12 hours or more, then the backside of the storm is yet to come.\" Forecasters said the storm would take at least 18 hours to make its way completely across the state. </p> <p>If the storm itself seemed endless, the clean-up operation will last much longer. The first damage assessment crews to appear on the streets yesterday were faced with a forest of fallen trees and branches inland, and seafront roads resembled the beaches from which tons of sand and other debris were kicked up by waves more than 3 metres (about 10ft) tall. </p> <p>\"Big chunks of coral are coming out of the ocean floor on to the boardwalk,\" said the mayor of Hollywood, Mara Giulianti. \"We have water everywhere. It's pretty frightening.\" </p> <p>With the flooding came the danger of electrocution from fallen power lines. Florida Power and Light positioned a 6,000-strong task force of workers on the border with Georgia, ready to move south and set to work as soon as the dangerous conditions eased. </p> <p>\"We are seeing extensive damage and we have a great deal of work ahead of us,\" said a spokeswoman, Kathy Scott. </p> <p>The sheriff of Broward County, Ken Jenne, warned of other potential hazards facing the hundreds of thousands of evacuees planning to return to their homes today. \"We have dozens of traffic lights down, and people either wait and wait at them or they just zoom through,\" he said. One motorist was killed in a post-hurricane road accident in Deerfield Beach. </p> <p>Three people were taken to hospital in Boynton Beach suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning after running a petrol generator indoors, and Governor Bush advised the public to take extra care when removing hurricane shutters or using chainsaws to cut up fallen trees. \"If you've never used a power tool such as this before, now is not the time to start doing it,\" he said. </p> <p>Hospitals around south Florida reported a surge in the number of weekend births. Don Chester, administrator at St Mary's Medical centre in West Palm Beach, said 100 expectant mothers were admitted as the storm passed by. \"We've delivered six babies, four boys and two girls, but none named Frances,\" he said. </p> <p>But in Stuart, a guest at the Suburban Lodge hotel who was unable to reach hospital in time, gave birth to a baby girl on Saturday night as the storm moved in. The baby will be christened Miranda Frances Bennett.</p>",
  "Did you buy a paper? I asked my daughter. No, she said with a grimace and shudder. \"I couldn't face it, I didn't want to read about it\". <p>The \"it\", of course, was Beslan, and hundreds of children like my daughter's children, like your children, lying in that charnel-house of a gym. The first day of school, the crisp new uniforms, the songs and clasped hands, then terrible fear and death. A universal nightmare seemingly beyond scripting or imagining. But now that we have seen it again and again on 24-hour news, now that the plumes of smoke and the naked kids running are images scarred on our brains, what does it mean? </p> <p>The danger, the real danger for professional politicians, professional journalists, professional know-alls everywhere, is not sensing the difference. So Boris Yeltsin was wrong to invade Chechnya a decade ago, and Vladimir Putin was wrong to play the hardest of hard men, and his crack troops cracked up. Wiser international counsels had better prevail. </p> <p>So, fine: but also, so what? Human revulsion slams the door on expertise and reason. These could have been our children. Perhaps, one malign day, they will be our children. And if there is such evil, then perhaps there is also something called an international terrorist conspiracy. </p> <p>Scant evidence, in all rationality, still buttresses that belief. Arabs among the Beslan corpses? Maybe, but Putin would say that, wouldn't he? Join Mother Russia in its \"full scale\" battle for democracy, truth and justice in the style and wake of Father Texas? Stroll on ... but don't stroll through the smoking ruins of Grozny, don't open your history books too wide. There are no simplicities here except the ultimate simplicity of total horror. But that may be enough. </p> <p>For the difficult, inescapable thing, watching those pictures, is an eery feeling of manipulation. Somebody planned this and reckoned the cameras would be there. Take a panning shot of Middle School No 1, go in close on the gym, frame the fleeing children from handy roof tops and let's see plenty of greenery, let's make Beslan like downtown Smallville or Littlehampton. We seemed to look down on a leafy stage set for carnage; and someone knew we would be watching. </p> <p>Perhaps, in another life, that someone might have found other uses for his talents: orchestrating Republican conventions or the backdrops at Brighton next month. He could have been super spin doctor, feted and interviewed. But instead, in the service of Chechnya, he sat alone in a darkened room and thought hard. </p> <p>What kind of outrage makes world news these days? Those early al-Qaida bomb blasts in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi seem pretty outdated now to be honest, just big bangs with loads of dead, no pictures beyond more destruction. Who cares about blowing holes in ships or trains? The wonder of 9/11 was the pictures, the twin towers toppling. Play it again, Sam. Osama had made No 1. </p> <p>How do you follow that? By seizing a Moscow theatre, maybe, by making a stage your stage. Putin couldn't pretend that wasn't happening; the curtain rose on his front doorstep. But the trouble was that the theatre doors were locked, that the cameras couldn't peer inside. You had to rely on imagination - on the thought that this could be Broadway or the West End - and it wasn't enough. You needed a brand new wheeze. </p> <p>Politicians and their intelligence advisers, of course, are always wittering on about WMD. They read Tom Clancy and multiply the threat because that's their particular obsession. It is what seems real to them. But why bother hitting Wall Street, or even Walsall, with hi-tech trappings when there are so many easier pickings on offer? </p> <p>Beslan, North Ossetia. What kind of dateline is that? An obscure town near the Chechen border. A suitable target for infiltration, no nuclear scientists required. Just take a school hostage and see what happens. </p> <p>Hostage-taking on a grand scale means time, among other things: time for the camera teams to arrive, time for the crisis and pressure to build. Will Putin give in? He can't. It would be the end of him. So it will all come to slaughter and bitter tears. But he'll have to let CNN, BBC and the rest see what happens if he wants to make this terrorism international. And then the world will, too, see what we Chechens can do. </p> <p>Someone, that someone, wrote the script. Someone with despair in his heart calculated how it would work out - and break from behind the borders of control that stop us seeing what happens inside Chechnya. Someone wanted to put his case on the international map. Mission accomplished. </p> <p>And for his next trick? An old peoples' home, a nursery, a hospital? There is no limit to the targets that may be chosen by terrorists who expect to die but know that they will make a splash in the process. There is no limit to the soft touches that cannot be anticipated or defended. Frontiers are meaningless, because pictures have no frontier. Fear needs no visa. </p> <p>Two bleak things follow. One is that - whether or not it exists on any organised level - we shall gradually come to identify a force called international terrorism, a force defined not by the coordination of its strikes or creeds but by the orchestration of its inhuman propaganda. I manipulate, therefore I exist. </p> <p>The other thing is self-knowledge for media-makers and media-watchers. If the malignant message is itself a device, a weapon of mass hysteria, how do we defuse it? By a suppression that undermines free society, that gives terror its victory? Or by the realisation that we are not puppets, that we must see and explain for ourselves. That we have a duty of understanding. </p>",
  "Vladimir Putin's solemn weekend broadcast to the Russian people struck many popular chords and will have satisfied most of his compatriots, but it left unclear what concrete changes in policy will come in the wake of the catastrophe of Beslan. <p>The president appealed to nostalgic Soviet patriots and Russia's ancient sense of encirclement when he said the collapse of the USSR left the country \"without defences either to the east or west\". He criticised the mistakes of the security forces, saying: \"We could have been more effective if we had acted professionally and at the right moment.\" </p> <p>He conjured up a frightening external threat, indirectly accusing the US of supporting terrorists and trying to disarm Russia as a nuclear power and pull territory away from it. \"Some would like to cut a juicy piece of our pie. Others help them,\" he said. \"Terrorism is just one instrument they use.\" </p> <p>He called for unity as the best form of strength because in the past \"we showed ourselves to be weak and the weak get beaten\". </p> <p>Mr Putin signalled that he intends to re-establish control over security across Russia. But how can he do it? He faces enormous challenges in all areas of domestic, military and foreign policies. </p> <p><b> Domestic</b><br> </p> <p> In putting all the blame on international terrorism, the president avoided using the word \"Chechnya\" at all. The measures he talked about in broad terms - to strengthen Russia's unity, create a new system of control over the northern Caucasus and set up an effective anti-crisis management system - need to be fleshed out. </p> <p>The speech also left the suspicion that Mr Putin was exploiting the shock of Beslan to accelerate efforts to create a more authoritarian and centralised form of rule, and using the notion of a terrorist war on Russia to divert attention from rising social and economic tensions. </p> <p>All the indicators show an increase in the gap between rich and poor, as well as stubbornly high rates of joblessness, particularly in parts of the northern Caucasus. The high world price for oil has given the government a cushion at least to pay wages and pensions on time, unlike a few years ago, but Mr Putin's neo-liberal economic strategy caused the biggest street protests of his presidency this summer. </p> <p>Other shocks are in store, including a rise in the domestic price of oil and gas, which will hit people's utility bills. Medicine is being privatised, leaving thousands defenceless. The closure of kindergartens and even schools is hitting families hard in smaller towns, many in the northern Caucasus - precisely the areas where tension can turn to violence. </p> <p>In central Russia discontent often turns to apathy. In Muslim regions it can lead people to Islamism. The oddest line in the president's speech was his suggestion that Russians cannot \"live in as carefree a manner as before\" - as though his compatriots have not endured some of the harshest ordeals in Eu rope in the last century, including civil war, dictatorship, foreign invasion, and the recent collapse in living standards and security which he himself mentioned. </p> <p><b> Military</b><br> </p> <p> Mr Putin has few options militarily. The war in Chechnya is going badly, and Russian deaths continue at a rate of 15 a week. The resistance fighters are not as strong as they were during the first Chechen war but the struggle is essentially at a stalemate. </p> <p>The president has gradually been restoring the power of the KGB, now renamed the FSB. It was weakened under President Yeltsin, but Mr Putin recently put the border guards back under FSB control. Handling terrorism is in the hands of a dozen different ministries and he may create a Russian version of the US department of home land security, essentially a strengthened FSB. </p> <p>Other ideas which were already under discussion before the Beslan atrocity were to raise the profile of Russia's security council. Under Igor Ivanov it has little clout and the key discussions on security take place weekly in what is sometimes called \"the little Politburo\". It is chaired by Mr Putin and includes all the \"power\" ministers: defence, interior, foreign affairs, as well as the prosecutor general. </p> <p>Sergei Ivanov, the defence minister and a friend of the president, who is tipped as his successor, might be appointed to chair the security council. Other suggestions are that the job of vice-president be re-established. </p> <p>Mr Putin's call for strengthening the unity of the country might mean a further boost for the restoration of \"vertical\" rule. He has already changed parliament's upper house, the federation council, so that regional governors and legislative leaders no longer sit in it. Now there is talk of the president appointing governors, rather than them being elected. This would bring Russia back towards the Soviet system of hierarchical one-party rule from Moscow. </p> <p><b> Foreign policy</b><br> </p> <p> The president's emphasis on a powerful external threat will cut into his foreign policy options. In the Caucasus, Russia's bargaining position has weakened over the last year. The new nationalist government in Georgia is unlikely to help seal its frontier with Russia when it is trying to remove the Russian troops from the disputed territory of South Ossetia, which was within Georgia's borders in Soviet times. </p> <p>Azerbaijan may be unwilling to help clamp down on its Chechen diaspora while Russia has failed to get Armenian troops out of the large areas of Azerbaijan which they occupy. </p> <p>The US and Russia are struggling for influence in the southern Caucasus, and Mr Putin will not want any American interference in the northern Caucasus, including Chechnya, as well. His claim that Washington is exploiting the disruption caused by terrorism is a warning that, even though both sides claim to be allies against an invisible international enemy, the rules of the game have strict limits.</p>",
  "I'm off in a couple of weeks to Los Angeles - the city where I've spent most of the past 25 years. It's a place outsiders love to disrespect: La La Land, the Nowhere City, Tinseltown, Lost Angeles, where all the oddballs rolled to when America tilted west. <p>Songsters can be sentimental about New York (\"it's a wonderful town\"), London (\"a foggy day in, etc\") and Glasgow (\"belongs to me\"). But not LA. To accompany the 1984 Olympics, the games tsar, Peter Ueberroth, commissioned a city anthem. Sinatra's sugary LA is My Lady flopped. Clear winner was Randy Newman's acerbic I Love LA: \"Look at that mountain/ Look at those trees/ Look at that bum over there, man/ He's down on his knees.\" </p> <p>Traditionally, LA is good for sour jokes. \"Who,\" Woody Allen asked, \"would want to live in a city where the only cultural advantage is right on red\"? According to Tom Taussik, \"The difference between Los Angeles and yogurt is that yogurt has real culture.\" And, of course, there are those like Dorothy Parker who dispute there is anything there: LA is \"seventy-two suburbs in search of a city\". Urban blah. </p> <p>LA has always inspired wildly contrary reactions - \"city of light, city of night\", as The Doors described it in LA Woman, the track that will forever thunder out on the city's classic rock stations. Reyner Banham, the architectural and design historian, famously popularised it as freeway utopia, the ideal blend of \"the four ecologies\" - beach, mountain, desert and town. In the trilogy beginning with City of Quartz, a work which eerily forecast the Rodney King riots, social historian Mike Davis has hammered away at his vision of LA as an \"apocalypse theme park\", the quintessence of all that is corrupt and doomed in the US. </p> <p>Personally I tend to the Banham/City of Light view. But whoever is right, LA is changing. Partly it's the slow breakdown of the state's social services, following the 1970s taxpayers' revolt; mainly it's uncontrollable immigration. With the North American Free Trade Agreement the southwest has virtually an open border with Mexico. Already hispanics are the major block in the state's population. With Cruz Bustamante, who gave Schwarzenegger a good run, they almost had their first hispanic governor. It won't be long. </p> <p>Historically, Mexico is merely reclaiming what was once its sovereign territory. Hispanic irredentism may herald Davis's apocalypse. </p> <p>The LA jokes currently circulating on the web reflect hispanic-Anglo tension. Flavour of the season are mock tests, such as the spoof Los Angeles High School Math Proficiency Exam which opens by requesting the information: \"Name/Gang/Make of Gun\" and has questions such as: \"Raoul is serving six years for murder. He made $10,000 for the hit. If his common-law wife is spending $100 per month, how much money will be left when he gets out of prison? How many years will he get for killing that bitch for spending his money?\" </p> <p>Less xenophobic, but still nastyish, is the spoof Greater Los Angeles Area Driver's License Application. It requests: (1) Name Stage name/Attorney. (2) Sex - a) Male; b) Female; c) Formerly Male; d) Formerly Female. If female, indicate breast implant size. Will the size of your implants hinder your ability to safely operate a motor vehicle in any way?\" </p> <p>The first multiple-choice question on the \"test\" is: \"If you are the victim of a car jacking, you should immediately: a) Call the police to report the crime; b) Call Channel 4 News to report the crime, then watch your car on the news on a high-speed chase; c) Call your attorney and discuss a lawsuit against cellular phone company for 911 call not going through; d) Call your therapist; e) None of the above (South Central residents only).\" </p> <p>Funny, but not exactly funny ha ha. Not much is Ha Ha in La La Land any more, it seems.</p>",
  "<p>One measure of the passage of time since the September 11 atrocities is the shifting tone of the anniversary coverage. While post-Diana programmes have reduced in number over the years, 9/11 television has multiplied - because the global consequences were so much greater - but has also become tougher. </p> <p>Last week's The Hamburg Cell (daringly entering the minds of the hijackers) would have been an impossible commission for the first or second anniversaries, and Channel 4's The 9/11 Conspiracies feels like another show which has only become permissable 36 months after the event. </p> <p>Documentaries about conspiracy theories - or \"counter-histories\", as some adherents prefer - are common on television but generally address questions of only distant sensitivity. </p> <p>The allegation that the Apollo moonlandings were tricked up in an Arizona film studio irritates former astronauts and NASA officials but can be watched by most viewers with a smile. And the various theories that Princess Diana was murdered or is riding Shergar on a desert island as Elvis and Lord Lucan look on, though painful for her immediate family, are actually comforting for her fans who prefer them to the savage lottery of a car crash. </p> <p>The alternative hypotheses for September 11, however, have more in common with Holocaust denial: you gasp that people can be so dismissive of body-counts and substantial documentation. </p> <p>George W Bush and Dick Cheney stood down America's air defences in order to allow an attack which would green-light the neo-cons' plans to hit Iraq. It was not a hijacked plane which hit the Pentagon but an American missile intended to fake damage: the jet was flown to a secret location where pilots and passengers now live. </p> <p>Most of these flights of fantasy are piloted by a theology professor who looks confusingly exactly like Dick Cheney, although former British minister Michael Meacher gives cautious support to some of them. The programme carefully takes apart each of these speculations. It concludes that America's air defences were lax because the nation lost its sense of vulnerability after the cold war. The sister of the pilot of the Pentagon plane explains with commendable calmness that he really wasn't the kind of guy to disappear to fake his death to play volleyball on a secret Hawaiian island with Princess Diana. </p> <p>At first, the documentary's response to these wacky narratives feels disproportionate: like Inspector Morse and Hercule Poirot reopening the Humpty Dumpty case. But then you understand that conspiracy theorists need to be met with their own obsessive solemnity. </p> <p>And, to be fair to the counter-historians, as the film is, the documentary touches on genuine miscarriages of official history. One, though already well-covered in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, is the evacuation of prominent Saudis from the States in the days after the attacks; the other is the presence in Manhattan of a van-load of young Israelis who may have been agents. </p> <p>But, apart from a casual reference to support for conspiracy theories rising as belief in politicians falls, the film is annoyingly short on context. Most of the anti-factual narratives about 9/11 result from a fact of contemporary politics: the belief of many people that the Bush-Cheney adminstration and/or the Israeli government are capable of almost anything. Crucially, the spread of 9/11 conspiracy theories became an industry not after 9/11 but following the Iraq war. </p> <p>In the same way, the internet fantasies about the moon landings are partly driven by the fact that Richard Nixon, the most divisive president until George W Bush, was in the White House at the time. And the belief that aliens landed at Roswell in New Mexico in 1946 - now an almost mainstream opinion in some parts of America - was oxygenated by the shock of Pearl Harbor and the invasion fears produced by the cold war. </p> <p>While alternative histories set themselves against the recorded story, they in fact have a symbiotic relationship with it. Only half of the interest in conspiracy theories is to do with whether they are true; the other fascination is why people believe them. Thorough and responsible on the first question, the programme more or less shrugs away the second. </p> <p>And, if you were the TV critic for al-Qaida, you would note from this programme that a) the cultural shock from 9/11 is receding in the west and b) a lot of those people distrust their leaders to a remarkable degree. </p> <p><strong>A waking nightmare</strong></p> <p>Inevitably most of the anniversary programmes look back, so The Grid, BBC2's three-part drama, is unusual among 9/11-inspired programmes in being futuristic. This US-UK co-production imagines Islamic terrorist cells in Britain, Africa and America plotting to top their signature atrocity. </p> <p>In subject-matter - fact-based speculation on al-Qaida - it's tempting to describe The Grid as a companion piece to The Hamburg Cell, except that they would disagree over almost everything. Where The Hamburg Cell was a responsible reconstruction from documentary sources, The Grid is a lurid fiction, in which a gas attack on a London hotel leads to panic on three continents. </p> <p>Seeking realism, The Grid uses the grammar of factual television: when a new character enters the room, the screen freezes and their name and job-title is typed on the screen. Regrettably, this borrowing from documentary is undermined by writing and acting which seem to aim for the opposite of naturalism. </p> <p>In a piece in which the different nationalities of the characters matter so much, it's unfortunate that much of the script is written in no recognisable language. Jemma Redgrave is required to say at one point: \"I'm sorry. I've also experienced anxiety about loved ones missing in action.\" </p> <p>Despite the lumpen script, there is one recurrent verbal pleasure in the scenes between British and American actors. Local pronounciation means that UK and US agents always seem to be subtly correcting each other, when discussing Kosovo or Iraq: you say Koss-ov-oh, I say Koe-so-vo, you eye-raq, I say ir-rarque, let's call the whole thing off. With so much stress on where the stresses fall, it's no surprise that an American character listed in the credits with the exotic name Canary pronounces it Cannery. </p> <p>Apart from these linguistic stand-offs, the security services are consistently depicted as being better at fighting each other than at confronting the enemy: in London, MI5 and MI6 bicker, while the FBI and NSC argue in Washington. </p> <p>These turf-wars are the strongest aspect of the series, but perhaps we shouldn't be surprised: US-UK co-productions know all about different factions with divergent agendas. Though watchable enough as a kind of Diet-24, The Grid visibly suffers from the trans-atlantic tensions it also portrays.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The 9/11 Conspiracies, Thursday, 9pm, Channel 4<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Grid, Tuesday-Thursday, 9pm, BBC2</p>",
  "<p>Watching England's abject performance in the last 20 minutes of their World Cup qualifying match against Austria, it was hard not to conclude that any number of watching Clives might have done a better job orchestrating matters from the England bench than Sven-Goran Eriksson. </p> <p>The national team, which we have been led to believe will peak at the 2006 World Cup, disintegrated into an unprofessional rabble playing with all the discipline and cohesion of a Sunday morning pub team. Clive Anderson might have communicated better to find out there was nothing wrong with Steven Gerrard when the Liverpool midfielder signalled Wayne Bridge was injured, only to find his gestures being wrongly interpreted by Eriksson and himself laughably being substituted by Jamie Carragher, a man utterly ill-suited to filling the Gerrard role in England's midfield. </p> <p>Or how about Clive Dunn? Having first found the Austrians don't like it up 'em with Blighty two goals to the good, even he might have seen the need for old-fashioned defensive bayonet action instead of the sloppy, gung-ho attack-at-all-costs style that may cost England dearly in their qualifying group. </p> <p>And then, of course, there is Sir Clive Woodward, who spoke last week of his desire to get into football coaching and management, all the way up to England level. On the face of it, the good knight would seem to be in a self-delusional cuckoo land inhabited by those who either are propelled by an out-of-control ego or swill down a little too much booze at the bar. But, as England continued to underachieve for the umpteenth time before Eriksson resorted to those irritating \"That's football\" platitudes that are becoming his hallmark, the feeling was growing that the nation's erstwhile top rugby coach could do no worse. </p> <p>It would have been interesting to hear what Woodward might have made of David James, whose blunder led to the equaliser. Would Sir Clive, with his dossiers on all aspects of players and opponents not to mention his attention to all manner of coaching minutiae, actually have had Manchester City's gaffe-prone goalkeeper anywhere near the England team in the first place? </p> <p>And would he not have the guts to grasp the Emperor's New Clothes issue of David Beckham? Captain Marvel he may once have been, but not any longer. When was the last time Beckham had a major influence on a meaningful international match? And is the man booked for a petulant second-half foul and who ran around like a headless chicken in those key closing minutes in Vienna actually the right man to be captaining the team? Sir Clive had Martin Johnson on whom he could rely, a figure of towering strength who rarely failed to deliver on the international stage. Increasingly, Beckham is looking like a show pony whose tricks no longer impress at the highest level. </p> <p>Surely Woodward, and indeed many other coaches, would conclude the time is right to give the leadership role to one who leads by example on the pitch. There are two obvious contenders, Gerrard or Gary Neville, and a man such as Woodward, who thought nothing of lobbing Neil Back out of his World Cup-winning team almost as soon as he arrived back in England, would certainly see Beckham is becoming an ever more ineffectual talisman. </p> <p>Sir Clive, in all probability, did not mean next week when he spoke about football and the England job. But defeat in Poland on Wednesday night, a possibility that seems by no means as improbable as a man walking out on the best job in rugby, would leave Eriksson on the thinnest of ice. The Swede's detractors within the FA are merely waiting for the moment to make their move, and Freddy Shepherd's shabby treatment of Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United means a ready-made caretaker is ready to take over at the helm while Woodward goes through tiresome formalities like acquiring a Uefa coaching badge and trying to gain credibility in the game he professes to love more than rugby (that must have raised a few eyebrows among the Twickenham faithful). Then Sir Clive can ease his way into the manager's chair. </p> <p>Woodward is a clever man. He has looked at what he perceives to be a lack of support for his methods in the RFU and walked. England's rugby results have been sliding, and there must be a serious doubt over whether or not England can regain their place as the dominant nation in the northern hemisphere, let alone the world, in the years leading to the next World Cup. </p> <p>Deep down, despite all his attacks on Old Fartdom and its inability or unwillingness to seize proper control of the professional game, I suspect Woodward has simply concluded that it is better to get out at the top instead of being shafted at a later date. And he is also shrewd enough to know his next move should be to find a leaky, underperforming unit, where any input he might make will be seen to be inspirational. </p> <p>Already, moves have been made behind the scenes to determine whether he might be interested in taking over the reins as performance director for UK Athletics to replace the retiring Max Jones, and the word is that athletics is another sport he might fancy. Exactly what the rival applicants, Charles van Commenee, Keith Connor and Daley Thompson, might make of that is uncertain. But one thing about Woodward, whether he winds up at Soho Square, Southampton or an Olympic stadium, is that he has total self-belief and knows precisely what is needed to be a winner. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The crowds that thronged the streets of Bolton on Saturday to catch a glimpse of Britain's 17-year-old boxing sensation Amir Khan cheered as he told them what they wanted to hear: that he would stay amateur until the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and bring back a gold medal for Great Britain to add to the silver he won in Athens. </p> <p>He says he wants to do it for his country and that, for now, the professional side of the sport can wait. This is all very laudable, and UK Sport is belatedly waking up to the fact that the youngster should be a recipient of elite lottery funding, which falls a little short of \u00a330,000 a year. Also, Adidas are sniffing around seeing how they might offer their support without breaching boxing's strict amateur code. But Amir should think long and hard about how he might make the most out of his remarkable rise to fame.</p> <p>Almost eight million viewers watched Khan's Olympic final on BBC1, where he lost narrowly to the outstanding Cuban Mario Kindel\u00e1n, with a million or more listening to the fight in radio commentary. By any definition, Khan is hot news. But medals do not pay bills, buy houses and provide for your family and Khan would do well to realise four years is a long time in the boxing world.</p> <p>There have been those who always rejected the overtures of the professional world. The Cuban heavyweight Te\u00f3filo Stevenson, who won three Olympic gold medals, turned down a fortune to turn pro and fight Muhammad Ali saying: \"Professional boxing treats a fighter like a commodity to be bought and sold and discarded when he is no longer of use. I wouldn't exchange my piece of Cuba for all the money they could give me.\"</p> <p>But Khan is a little different, not least because he is unencumbered by the constraints of Castro's communism. A wrong assumption seems to be gaining currency whereby Khan will automatically gain world No1 status with Kindel\u00e1n's anticipated retirement and reign supreme until 2008. But suppose that another brilliant fighter comes out of Cuba to ruin the plans. Then Khan's marketability and earning capacity is damaged.</p> <p>The Amateur Boxing Association might not like to hear it, but my advice would be for Amir to sign as a pro and strike while the opportunity is there. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It is hard to believe any cricketer has ever hit the ball with greater ferocity than Andrew Flintoff. Once upon a time, \"getting Freddied\" involved consuming gallons of lager with a curry thrown in. But now that the Lancashire fat lad has metamorphosed into an athlete the world watches with awe, bowling attacks have learned that \"getting Freddied\" has a new meaning. In his last 17 ODIs Flintoff averages 87.89 with the bat and has 20 wickets at 19.15. Zimbabwe, England's ICC Trophy opponents on Friday, will be quaking in their boots.</p>",
  "<p>Many moons ago Alexander Bocheski wrote a book called The History of Stupidity in Poland. Between the hours of five and eight on Saturday night it felt like England would have to add a new chapter on Wednesday if they were to lose to the prosaic Poland team that won this dirge of a game. </p> <p>But Austria's late goals, David James' calamitous mistake and Poland's modest but rising self-belief means that England may have to be only average to succumb in Chorzow. </p> <p>\"We're feeling confident again,\" said Liverpool's Jerzy Dudek, Poland's highest-profile player. \"But England are an exciting team. You can see how Sven-Goran Eriksson has changed their style. They play more attacking football now. It's not like it used to be when they played kick and rush. I can't understand why people want Eriksson to go.\" </p> <p>It is worth repeating that Dudek's words came before England kicked off in Vienna. After England's declining second-half performance he may have altered his thoughts about Eriksson. But what he thinks of Poland should remain unchanged. </p> <p>This is a workmanlike team that possesses a reasonable spine and a little embroidery on the right wing in the form of Bayer Leverkusen's left-footed Jacek Krzynowek, who scored the third goal here against an embarrassed Northern Ireland side. That was in the 57th minute and Krzynowek was then withdrawn. He was not injured. </p> <p>Lawrie Sanchez's players had lost heart and shape by then. In fact they had lost it inside four minutes when Maciej Zurawski's corner was allowed to fly straight in courtesy of Damien Johnson's unaccountable decision to duck on the line rather than head the ball away. An equally baffling misjudgment by Stephen Craigan shortly before half-time gifted Piotr Wlodarczyk the freedom to make it 2-0. </p> <p>But the scale of the Irish collapse made it difficult to gauge Poland's qualities. Sanchez said the difference between his team and the Poles was in the finishing - \"Otherwise we matched them in general play\" - but he also said that England's extra attacking dimension should ensure a similar difference between them and Poland. England's scout here, Martin Hunter, should relate similar thoughts. </p> <p>Southampton's Graeme Le Saux was another Englishman in Belfast on Saturday and he agreed. The former Chelsea defender played in the England side that won in Poland in 1997 and he said - again before the Austria match - that England's \"flair and creativity\" should see them through. </p> <p>\"Poland are beatable,\" Le Saux said. \"Two of their goals here were self-inflicted by Northern Ireland. It's rare you would see mistakes like that. I'd be optimistic for England. </p> <p>\"But the Poles are good athletes, the back four is experienced and holds a strong line, the holding midfielder Mariusz Lewandowski is a frustrating player and in front of him Sebastian Mila was effective. </p> <p>\"If England use their width and draw Lewandowski out of position they can get at the back line. You do not go into this game thinking England are going to lose.\" </p> <p>The good news for England is that Wlodarczyk is suspended, having been shown a straight red card for swinging a blow at Mark Williams ten minutes from the end. As Poland are also missing the injured naturalised Nigerian-born Emmanuel Olisadebe, two of their key strikers are absent. The substitute Damian Gorawski could start or the rangy Mila could be pushed further forward as his repeated bursts from midfield offered Poland's most eye-catching threat. </p> <p>But after collecting these three points Poland are not under any pressure to win. A draw would leave them two points above England in the group. Poland's two fixtures after that are both away from home, in Austria and Wales. </p> <p>Those will be harder affairs than this and Poland's opponents will take hope from Northern Ireland's three clear chances. Johnson, probably still reflecting on his early mistake, spurned the first after good work by David Healy against a resolute central defence. The other two came late and fell to the captain Aaron Hughes. Dudek saved the first and Hughes then showed a defender's instinct to nod the second wide. </p> <p>Hughes was distraught at the end and not just because of those opportunities. This was meant to be the dawn of a new Irish era. There was a sell-out crowd and the request to turn Windsor Park into a \"sea of green\" saw Belfast's sports shops run out of replica shirts. </p> <p>Despite such optimism Northern Ireland delivered the worst display in memory and serious seasickness set in. They now travel to Cardiff even more hesitant than the English will be in Poland. </p> <p> <strong> Northern Ireland</strong> (4-4-2): <strong> Taylor 5 </strong> (Birmingham); <strong> A Hughes 6</strong> (Newcastle), <strong> Craigan 4</strong> (Motherwell), <strong> Williams 4</strong> (MK Dons), <strong> Capaldi 4</strong> (Plymouth); <strong> Johnson 4</strong> (Birmingham), <strong> Whitley 4</strong> (Sunderland), <strong> M Hughes 5</strong> (Crystal Palace; <strong> Jones</strong> , Crewe, 52), <strong> Elliott 6</strong> (Hull; <strong> McVeigh, </strong> Norwich, 62);<strong> Quinn 4</strong> (Willem II; <strong> Smith,</strong> Preston, 73), <strong> Healy 6</strong> (Preston). </p> <p><strong> Poland</strong> (4-1-3-2): <strong> Dudek 6</strong> (Liverpool); <strong> Zewlakow 5</strong> (Anderlecht), <strong> Glowacki 7</strong> (Wisla Krakow), <strong> Bak 7</strong> (Lens), <strong> Rzasa 6</strong> (Heerenveen); <strong> Lewandowski 7</strong> (Shakhtar Donetsk); <strong> Kryznowek 7</strong> (Leverkusen; <strong> Gorawski,</strong> Wisla Krakow, 67), <strong> Mila </strong> 7 (Groclin; <strong> Radomski,</strong> Hereenveen, 75), <strong> Zienczuk 5 </strong> (Eintracht Frankfurt); <strong> Zurawski 6</strong> (Wisla Krakow; <strong> Krysalowicz, </strong> 83) <strong> Wlodarczyk 4</strong> (Legia Warsaw). </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> J Wegereef (Netherlands).</p>",
  "<p>Not the taxpayers of Greece, given the bill that will be landing on their pay packets - although they will get a purpose-built weightlifting auditorium to enjoy for years to come. </p> <p>No, the real winners are the athletes who won gold - but even then, working out which nation really did best is a tricky business. </p> <p>In crude terms, it was the United States that came out top, with its 35 golds, followed by China and Russia. Obviously, countries with large populations will tend to do well because sheer weight of numbers will throw up more of the freaks of nature able to run faster or jump higher than the competition. </p> <p>But population size alone is not a good predictor of Olympic success. </p> <p>Look at India, with a population of a billion and just a silver medal to show for it. In any case, if China were to win every gold medal bar one awarded to the Bahamas, the Bahamas would still be ahead on a population per medal basis - with fewer than 300,000 people, the Bahamas come well out on top of this year's gold medal winners when ranked by population size alone. </p> <p>Modern sport, however, also requires a lot of expensive infrastructure - swimming pools, velodromes, professional leagues - in order for national success to be achieved. </p> <p>While black athletes from developing world countries are prominent in their success on the track, especially in the middle and long-distance running dominated by countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, there were few non-European faces on the winners' podium at the poolside or in the yachting, equestrian, fencing, canoeing, cycling, rowing and shooting events. </p> <p>On the other hand, Asian countries dominate some sports, especially badminton, and the various martial arts disciplines such as judo and archery, although they tend to be industrialised Asian nations such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. </p> <p>There does appear to be a connection between wealth and medal size, though, as with India and its solitary silver, it does not tell the whole story. Switzerland, one of the world's wealthiest countries, could only manage a single gold, while tiny Luxembourg, another moneybags, could not manage a medal of any hue. </p> <p>So how can we tell who has done well, adjusted for size and income? Just dividing medals by total national income does not say much, because that does not account for population size. The answer is to use an international comparison beloved of economists - national income per head, adjusted for purchasing power parity. </p> <p>By dividing the number of gold medals won by individual national income, we have a comparison that takes into account cost of living differences between the wealthy and the less well-off but which does not penalise large developing countries. It also recognises the different performances between the wealthy winners. </p> <p>This throws up some interesting results, as we can see from the chart at the end of the article. China tops the table, its immense population size balanced out by the country's relatively low income. </p> <p>Ethiopia's modest population size and low national income shows what an achievement its two gold medals really were. The same also goes for Kenya. </p> <p>This new medal table also reveals that the American gold medal haul of 35 is impressive, not just because of the country's wealth or size, as is Australia's 17 golds. These figures show that both countries' successes are actually attributable to their being fiercely good at sport, especially compared with the large, wealthy laggards of Europe - Germany at 19th, France 23rd, and Britain down at 26th. </p> <p>Why count only gold medals, and not silver and bronze? Because total medal counts again favour the larger and wealthier countries, which compete in a host of different sports, thus picking up bronzes and silvers which the smaller nations have little or no chance to compete for. </p> <p>To even things out, it is worth looking at how the world's mightiest trade blocs stack up. Nafta - the North American Free Trade Area - encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico, manages 119 medals. </p> <p>The European Union - even sticking with the 15 members before the recent enlargement of the union, to make things fair - can boast 223 golds, silvers and bronzes. That is some trade surplus. </p> <p><strong> The real Olympic medal table</strong> </p> <p><strong> Rank country golds $ per gold</strong> </p> <p>1 China 32 145 </p> <p>2 Russia 27 299 </p> <p>3 Cuba 9 311 </p> <p>4 Ethiopia 2 390 </p> <p>5 Ukraine 9 533 </p> <p>6 Romania 8 811 </p> <p>7 Uzbekistan 2 820 </p> <p>8 Kenya 1 1010 </p> <p>9 US 35 1031 </p> <p>10 Georgia 2 1135 </p> <p>11 Australia 17 1614 </p> <p>12 Hungary 8 1633 </p> <p>13 Japan 16 1711 </p> <p>14 Jamaica 2 1840 </p> <p>15 Brazil 4 1862 </p> <p>16 Morocco 2 1865 </p> <p>17 South Korea 9 1884 </p> <p>18 Cameroon 1 1910 </p> <p>19 Germany 14 1927 </p> <p>20 Turkey 3 2100 </p> <p>21 Zimbabwe 1 2180 </p> <p>22 Thailand 3 2296 </p> <p>23 France 11 2458 </p> <p>24 Italy 10 2617 </p> <p>25 Belarus 2 2750 </p> <p>26 UK 9 2953 </p> <p>27 Azerbaijan 1 3010 </p> <p>28 Indonesia 1 3070 </p> <p>29 Greece 6 3128 </p> <p>30 Iran 2 3345 </p> <p>Source: World Bank, CIA Factbook </p> <p>'$ per gold' is gross national income per head, expressed in purchasing power parity of US dollars, divided by number of gold medals won</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Richard Adams is a leader writer for the Guardian</p>",
  "<p>A United States cricket team attempting to mix it with world cricket's elite for the first time in the Champions Trophy hardly needed an untimely intervention from Hurricane Frances. But yesterday, with the rest of the squad already in London, officials were frantically phoning Florida to try to ascertain the whereabouts of their veteran all-rounder Tony Reid. </p> <p>Hurricane Frances is only progressing at about eight miles an hour, but that was still much too fast for Reid, a 42-year-old Bajan, who remains stranded in the storm-ravaged state. The US coach, the former West Indies batsman Faoud Bacchus, has learned to field such setbacks philosophically. Don't imagine that the United States cricket team embodies the usual attributes of fresh-faced, physically fit college boys. We are talking immigrant West Indians and Asians who, let's say, have seen the world a little. </p> <p>The world that Reid will see over the next few days, though, is not a five-star London hotel, practice matches against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, and discussions about how the United States, the rank outsiders, can match New Zealand at The Oval on Saturday. His world is one of uprooted trees, torn-down power lines and likely damage running into billions of pounds. </p> <p>\"Three of us left Florida just in time and we drove eight hours to Atlanta to catch a plane to England, but Tony had just returned from Jamaica and wasn't prepared,\" said Bacchus. \"He won't get out. The airports are still closed, phone lines are down, there might be no electricity and even if you could drive a car, you will struggle to get some gas. </p> <p>\"He will have to sit tight for at least another 36 hours. We're not confident that he will be here by the weekend.\" </p> <p>Bacchus lived in Canada when he played for them as a middle-order batsman in the late 70s - \"Clive Lloyd and Gordon Greenidge lived in England, so it was not much different\" - and moved to Orlando in 1988. He runs a car business, repairing and selling crashed cars. Compared to rehabilitating ageing US cricketers, it is a breeze. </p> <p>United States cricket has countless problems; an immigrant game entirely ignored in the schools. Cricketing migrants have to spend five years in the States before they can qualify and by then their lives have often changed. </p> <p>\"People move to the States for betterment,\" said Bacchus. \"They are often the ones who have failed to make it to the top in cricket elsewhere. The first thing they do is buy a house, a car, get married, settle down - all the things you should not do if you are playing cricket.\" </p> <p>The ICC, cricket's governing body, is flirting with expansion in the States. But an anticipated World Cup match in 2007 did not materialise because of fears over visa problems and a new ground in Fort Lauderdale, which Bacchus believes could draw crowds of more than 10,000 for international tournaments remains in abeyance. </p> <p>But, for the moment, the Champions Trophy beckons.
