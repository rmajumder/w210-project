  "<p>The term \"prima donna\" was once a compliment in opera but has become a general insult about those who make a fuss. Two showbiz stars - one in opera - earned the term this week.</p> <p>The conductor Riccardo Muti pulled out of seven Verdi performances at the Royal Opera House after the London company slightly altered the set of the Italian's imported La Scala production. And, on the same day, TV footage showed Sir Elton John in Taiwan, furious in a blue tracksuit at being asked to wait in line to show his passport after landing in his private jet.</p> <p>These off-stage arias are examples of what is known, in another showbiz euphemism, as \"artistic temperament\". Most star performers - whether in pop, opera, theatre or movies - eventually have such an outburst, raising the question of whether the temperamental become artists, or the artists become temperamental.</p> <p>Certainly, there is a recognisable type. The Conservative politician Richard Luce, who served in the Foreign Office and the arts ministry, remarked on the different temperaments he witnessed. When a theatre director thumped the minister's desk and spoke of a \"catastrophe for the entire civilised world\", it meant that the grant to the Shrewsbury Playhouse had fallen behind inflation; while an FO official's murmur about a \"little local difficulty\" might refer to a dictator slaughtering a thousand British passport-holders.</p> <p>Neither of these reactions - emotionally overblown and emotionally stunted - is ideal, but they follow from the kind of personalities who are drawn to Rada and the diplomatic service.</p> <p>Although members of the performing professions are obviously interested in showing off, this often comes not from a sense of their importance, but of worthlessness. Alcoholics have been defined as egomaniacs with low self-esteem, and showbiz stars (many of whom are heavy drinkers) are a classic illustration of this paradox.</p> <p>Living for applause on stage, they crave the same buzz when the show is over. Illegal substances are the most notorious substitute, but status also becomes a sort of alternative applause: the stretch limousine an ovation, the freshly painted dressing room an encore, the no-wait airport immigration an award for your importance.</p> <p>Knowing nothing of Riccardo Muti's private appetites, I would guess that his favourite narcotic is deference. Until a recent democratic correction by the younger generation, conductors have traditionally mainlined on inflated acclaim.</p> <p>And this touches on the other explanation for celebrity temperament: they behave like kings because they are treated like kings. This can be seen in the Royal Opera House's statement of regret that \"Maestro Muti\" has fallen out with them over the size of the set's walls.</p> <p>It's possible that this opera-house honorific is being used facetiously, but it is just as likely that Muti expects and receives it without irony. The British honours system has proved that calling people \"Lord\" or \"Sir\" often leads them to believe that they have superior DNA, and so the consequences of addressing someone as \"Maestro\", a distinction given to far fewer, can easily be imagined.</p> <p>Though Reg Dwight became Elton John and then Sir Elton, there is no pop equivalent of \"maestro\", except, possibly, \"she\", as in \"Listen to what she's asking for now!\" - a phrase more commonly used of male stars than, say, Madonna.</p> <p>But what's interesting about Sir Elton's Taiwanese heebie-jeebies is that he has recently presented himself as someone in recovery from self-obsession. He jokes on chatshows about the time when, overblown on coke, he phoned down from a suite at the Paris Ritz and ordered the concierge to stop the rain outside his window. </p> <p>Now clean of drink and drugs, Sir Elton wrote a song called \"Ego\" (mocking his previous self-love) and took part in a documentary called Tantrums and Tiaras, shot by his partner David Furnish, in which he again drew a separation between the Elton who looked out of the bottom of pills and drink bottles and the new improved one.</p> <p>Ominously, however, even this portrayal included a scene in which the star stormed off a tennis court after a member of the public waved at him. What caused the to-do, Elton explained, was that the woman had shouted, \"Yoo hoo!\" And now we discover that Sir Elton's mocking of his past star demands does not extend to queuing at immigration with ordinary people.</p> <p>This is partly a result of his personality, but also of 35 years of being encouraged to think that he's a special kind of person. The behaviour of Sir Elton and Maestro Muti makes clear that, even if Britain became a republic, we would still be the subjects of the true royalty of our times: showbiz stars.</p>",
  "<p> Last weekend I was doing some work on a Habinteg HA property in my own neighbourhood of Southfields. It was an infill scheme, probably completed in the early 90s. providing special needs accommodation for people with disabilities. </p> <p>There was a family of three living in the house we were working on, a mother recently out of hospital and now confined to a wheelchair and her two teenage sons. She was confronted with the daunting day-to-day struggle of living with a debilitating long term illness, the gnawing loneliness caused by isolation and the recent departure of her partner, and the task of trying to keep her sons on the straight and narrow. </p> <p>But in the midst of this struggle were the housing association, providing and adapting this lifetime home with ongoing specialist support.</p> <p>Talking to the family, which was infinitely preferable to the task of painting, I was struck by the most difficult question I face as Chief Executive of the Housing Corporation - how to bridge the day to day reality of housing association work on the ground, the reality of working with a family like this, with the perpetual policy discourse played out in the thinner air of the corridors of Whitehall. It is this clash of micro and macro, the need to implement policy in a way that somehow meets the needs of a Habinteg and the residents whom they serve, while still satisfying the relentless numerical demands of the Treasury and others. This is what keeps me awake at night.</p> <p>I regard my speech today as the second half of a two partner. The first part I gave at Harrogate at the CIH conference stared through the macro end of the telescope. It took the policy imperatives flowing from the Communities Plan, as filtered through the analysis of the Barker and Gershon reviews, to present a picture of where the Housing Corporation was heading. Its central premise was that we were moving from being the allocator of grant to becoming the procurer of new homes on behalf of Government, and from a one size fits all model of regulation to a risk-based model. It also talked about the particular demands of regional devolution, growth areas, renewal areas, special purpose vehicles and the like. You can find it and read it if you like on our web-site.</p> <p>Here in Birmingham, I want to turn my telescope around and look at the world from the perspective of you as a sector. Using a range of examples, I want to set out where I think the housing association movement, (to the extent that we can still talk about a single movement), might be heading, and about how the Housing Corporation can help.</p> <p>Like my Chairman, Peter Dixon, I was a huge fan of the sector long before I arrived at the Corporation. My career has criss-crossed the work of the sector, from the HA sponsorship division at the then Department of the Environment through partnership in estate renewal while working in London local government to working on affordable warmth schemes in the charitable sector, from the high policy terrain of the Housing Minister's office through the reality of building in social housing to gap funding at English Partnerships and finally, to exemplary design work at CABE.</p> <p>I consider the growth of the HA sector in this country to be an international phenomenon of historic importance. I also believe that the movement is the best example of the Third Way that the Prime Minister is likely to find during his tenure, with \u00a327 billion of public money and \u00a322 billion of private finance now embedded in almost 2 million homes.</p> <p>I am therefore firmly on your side from day one. There will be times when you doubt it, perhaps the advent of grant for non-RSLs or the harsh sting of efficiency data, but there is nothing I want more than to see this sector prosper. This support is not borne from nostalgia or territorialism, but rather, a firm held belief backed up by significant evidence that working with and through the sector is an effective means of meeting the needs of more households - from the homeless to prospective first time buyers.</p> <p>In the remainder of this speech, I want to look at three questions:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> what are the key strengths of the sector that, from a Corporation perspective, we are looking for you to build on </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> what are the new opportunities for the sector that the Corporation is looking for you to respond to</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> what are the demands on the sector that the Corporation needs to reflect and even facilitate in our policies.</p> <p> Three strengths, three opportunities, three demands.</p> <p>First, the three strengths - your diversity, your innovation and your asset strength.</p> <p>First then, diversity. By diversity here, I mean the growing heterogeneity within the sector. </p> <p>While you are united in the primary cause, the provision of affordable homes, you are choosing many different directions for future development. This is challenging for the Corporation in regulatory terms, and consequently we must keep our own regulatory guidance on diversification under review. </p> <p>But it is also welcome. While there are givens for all of you - rent restructuring, decent homes - the Government has many tasks that it needs associations to grapple with; let me rattle through a list:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> general needs social rent<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> key workers<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> supported housing<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> temporary housing provision<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> move-on accommodation for refugees<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> partial and full stock transfers<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> neighbourhood management<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> estate renewal<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> strategic site development<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> conversions and major rehabs<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> procurement expertise<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> market renewal<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> town extensions<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> rural provision<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> public private partnerships, including PFI</p> <p>..and that list is by no means exhaustive.</p> <p> At the Corporation, we want to see associations developing their own unique brand identity linked to their own strengths and visions. For some associations, we know that will mean hard questions, not just in terms of where you should focus your efforts, but also what you should stop doing. </p> <p>At present, we can see that there are some areas of under provision on the part of HAs. I would for example, like to see more associations moving into the specialist provision of move-on accommodation for refugees, sharing the burden with the likes of Safe Haven and Refugee HA. The addition of a question about refugee provision has been added to the next RSR to help us track this provision.</p> <p>Taking just one other area, the passage of the current Housing Bill is likely to create greater opportunities for some housing associations to specialise in managing empty privately owned accommodation on behalf of local authorities. I hope that some of you will grasp this opportunity.</p> <p>The In Business for Neighbourhoods agenda also brings focus to many of your value added opportunities. For example, associations now construct or acquire an average of 6,000 homes a year and improve a further 7,000 units all without SHG. These alone amount to an estimated added value of about \u00a3450 million a year.</p> <p>Across the country, associations make even greater contributions to supporting other Government objectives; for example, by funding community wardens or supporting training opportunities, housing associations are often providing the crucial 'glue' that holds hard pressed communities together.</p> <p>There are two associations that I visited over the summer which showed the full benefits of grasping the In Business agenda. The first in Liverpool is CDS Plus and their work in the L8 district of Liverpool. This is one of five full neighbourhood management pilots in the country. </p> <p>However, to understand the L8 story more fully, one has to appreciate the LIFE model that all the main HAs in Liverpool have developed together. Effectively, they have split the geography of the city between them in allocating 'lead' roles. The remaining associations in each area have then identified themselves within each city quarter as either influencing, following or exiting associations. Over time, this should help to rationalise stock holdings and lead to more efficient and effective delivery of development and management services. </p> <p>In Liverpool 8, CDS plus have used their leadership role to work with the City Council, the police and others to establish a one-stop shop for all neighbourhood services, backed up by some good quality new build and some innovative rehab.</p> <p>The second example is longer established, the work of Poplar HARCA. Here, a housing association has defined its mission by the constraints of geography. It is a true community association, with provision from parents and toddlers through to older residents, mixing economic, social and environmental interventions.</p> <p>These 'housing plus' benefits need to be encouraged and increased. Accordingly, we have initiated a major research project to quantify the added value generated by associations, which will report in 2005. In the interim, we intend to publicise examples of added value to encourage associations to consider how they can do more, and also to help facilitate associations' ability to draw down resources from other parts of Government.</p> <p>The second key strength is innovation. I already knew that the sector was a hive of creativity but seeing is believing. </p> <p>On the challenge of environmental sustainability, associations like Gallion and Catalyst are pushing the boundaries in achieving excellent eco-homes at affordable costs. This is crucial for the Corporation as we consider the timing of moving to at least demanding a 'very good' eco-homes rating on new development.</p> <p>I am seeing innovation in regeneration. In Sheffield, I saw the excellent work that Places for People are leading in the re-development of the Norfolk Park estate, working hand-in-hand with the private sector. </p> <p>In Newcastle, both Nomad and Enterprise 5 impressed me with their commitment to resident involvement in the development process. </p> <p>In London, it has been Toynbee and Bethnal Green Victoria Park who showed me how good urban design and traditional homes can still create thrilling environments. </p> <p>Partnership with the private sector seems to be a recurring and encouraging theme. Another great regeneration project was in Birmingham - this time a partnership between Optima and Crest Nicholson, renewing five estates with a fully integrated mixed tenure scheme. </p> <p>Last week in Slough I saw this terrific scheme as a result of a partnership between Thames Valley HA and Wimpey.</p> <p>I'm also seeing great brownfield and refurb. Projects such as </p> <p>Derwent HA in Loughborough, </p> <p>Metropolitan at Portland Square in Nottingham</p> <p>Community HA at Passmore House in London.</p> <p>I have seen excellent innovation in development models and structures - Harvest, Maritime and Devon &amp; Cornwall are just three associations that have impressed in this respect.</p> <p>I have seen plenty of innovation driving the best LSVT associations, </p> <p>the work of Procure 21 driven by St Helena and Knowsley, </p> <p>the sheer ambition of Sunderland HG.</p> <p>I have seen fantastic community work being undertaken by some of our BME associations, such as North Muslim HA around Stoke Newington &amp; Clapton, and Spitalfields HA, celebrating their 25th anniversary this year, and busy working with other HAs to stitch back together parts of the East End.</p> <p>The roll call could go on and on. I am impressed and excited. And while you will rightly worry about the implications of the current efficiency drive, I do not want to slake your thirst for creativity and innovation. What I do want however is two things. </p> <p>First, it would be good to see more discipline in turning innovation into mainstream practice. A good example of this is in Modern Methods of Construction where we need to see partner relations flourishing with contractors and manufacturers to start driving higher volumes. A second example is the hundreds of projects funded through our Innovation and Good Practice programme where dissemination of outcomes seems too often to be overlooked or downplayed.</p> <p>Second, we have to shout louder about all the brilliant things the sector is doing. I was and am a big fan of the In Business agenda. I was a personal patron long before I joined the Corporation and I now want the Corporation to be In Business too. But I have seen the recent 1st anniversary results and they look all too true to me. You are still talking predominantly to yourselves. You are not reaching the key decision-makers and the key commentators often enough. The result is that too often you are being passed over for new responsibilities and opportunities.</p> <p>We at the Corporation must take some responsibility for this and we must become more powerful advocates for the work of the sector. But the sector itself needs to up its game. Out there in the neighbourhoods you are punching above your weight, but in the corridors of Whitehall, Westminster and Wapping, you are too often featherweight. </p> <p>Let me then turn to a third strength, your asset base, your financial muscle. The Global Accounts analysis this year revealed a sector which overall is in a rude state of health, with surpluses up, and gearing and interest cover ratios both healthy. </p> <p>As regulator, we look at these numbers with caution. We are probably at the top end of the property cycle, with a surge in receipts and capital values. Things may change. Certainly, we are not going to push you towards the cliff edge in search of short term gains at the expense of long term viability.</p> <p>However, as investors on behalf of Government, we are looking for you to use those assets creatively. We are looking for more innovative forms of financing with the lenders, we are content to see a certain level of cross-subsidy to reduce the call on the public purse, and we do want to see associations pooling their asset strength to maximise leverage.</p> <p>The Corporation itself will also be looking for new ways to invest to optimise our return. Clearly, the prospect of grant for non-RSLs is one route but our relationship with English Partnerships may well open others, as exemplified by The Challenge Fund and, more recently, the London-wide initiative. In the past, our investment has been in the form of grant but in the future it may, in part, be in the form of equity - sharing more of the risk, more of the return.</p> <p>Turning then from strengths to opportunities. I want to talk about three opportunities:</p> <p><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> the opportunity provided by the move to risk-based regulation</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the opportunity provided by a larger investment programme</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the opportunity provided by the partnering process.</p> <p>First then, the move to risk-based regulation. We commenced our Regulatory Change programme in 2002, and we have so far seen the introduction of lead regulation, Housing Corporation Assessments and our efficiency programme. We are also about to publish a revised memorandum with the Audit Commission, as the relationship between regulation and inspection starts to bed down pretty well. </p> <p>Now it is time for another major step. The development of a risk model will allow us to allocate our regulatory resources more efficiently, based on the probability of something going awry and the impact if it does. Bob Dinwiddy will go through the detail of this later in the conference but for about 100 associations, it will mean that you are going to see considerably less of us from now on. We are going to quickly reduce your regulatory burden and re-allocate those resources where they are more needed.</p> <p>Second, the opportunity presented by a bigger investment programme. We do not know the full detail of the Spending Review outcomes as yet but we do know that it is good news, with more money to tackle growing problems of homelessness by the provision of more homes for social rent. Clearly, this is core business we all know well but the pressure is on us to develop the right homes of the right size in the right places at the right price.</p> <p>With the focus on London and the South East, many of these additional homes will be delivered through section 106 agreements. That is why we are working closely with ODPM on the revision of PPG3 and will shortly issue a revised policy statement on how we will work on section 106 schemes. Our approach will be positive but will demand early engagement where Social Housing Grant is likely to be required.</p> <p>At the same time, in allocating scarce resources, we need to know who is developing efficiently. There are two tools that will help us here. The growing and successful use of our impact assessments is giving us excellent feedback on the quality of new development. We now want to complement this by establishing an index of development costs, in terms of grant required. This will not be easy and will require full and proper evolution and consultation, but if we can get it right, it will allow us and you to help benchmark your development performance. </p> <p>While complying with the Regional Housing Strategies, we will also be increasingly targeted in how we use our resources. For example, we are increasingly concerned about overcrowding in parts of London and urgently need to increase the provision of family homes. We know this is hard while still meeting unit numbers but I have seen the conditions in which some families are now living, particularly among the Bengali community, and standing still is not an option. </p> <p>Third, the opportunity provided by partnering. Many of you no doubt see this more as threat than opportunity, as the entitlement to ADP resources dries up. We accept that there must be a full evaluation of the partnering programme and we will be commissioning this shortly.</p> <p>But unless that study throws up some very unexpected results, then I think we can safely say that partnering is here to stay. Already we are seeing some really excellent partnerships develop. </p> <p>To give just one example, the NEAT partnership in the North East made up of Enterprise 5, Endeavour, Newcastle and Witney, and Tynedale , a real mix of associations in terms of stock size, distribution, traditional and LSVT, but increasingly combining their asset strength and wielding combined purchasing power. </p> <p>And partnership is increasingly spanning the sectoral divide. For example, we have what I call the Gang of 8 - Hyde, Metropolitan, L&amp;Q and Southern combining with Westbury, Countryside, Bellway and Bovis to provide standard scheme specifications, joint procurement plans, standard section 106 clauses and development protocols. Whether gearing up for grants for non-RSLs or not, this must be sound business development practice.</p> <p>We certainly want partnering to evolve. Neil Hadden, my Deputy, will talk more about this tomorrow but we look towards the prospect of longer term rolling programmes with our partners, driving economies and efficiencies, while upping the quality of the product through experiential learning. The key word going forward will be 'relationship', together, HC and partner HA, building up programmes of schemes on an open book basis, optimising the use of public sector land courtesy of English Partnerships, local government and others, and sharing risk and return. </p> <p>For those of you not in the partner group, I know you will be asking yourself hard questions. Some of you have or will cede your development ambition and focus on management specialisms. Others will retain that development ambition but will seek to fulfil this without access to our resources. Others will also seek to retain the ambition but know that they will need to accede to a partnership with other associations or existing partners. And finally, there will be a small number of associations on the cusp of partnership, who can realistically hope to become fully fledged partners in due course.</p> <p>All these are of course legitimate business courses. The key is to adopt a realistic stance. Partnering is already evolving. The competition will continue to hot up as our demands continue to increase. Non-RSLs are ready to enter the fray. Our demand is higher quality and lower costs, and we do not consider that an impossible equation for the top providers in both sectors. We are becoming more sophisticated in our partner programme evaluation. We will spot and discard the marriages of convenience in the pursuit of genuine added value.</p> <p>So finally from strengths and opportunities to demands upon the sector. There are again two I want to consider, the demand to become more efficient and the demand to be more responsive to residents.</p> <p>Let me then start with efficiency and the pilot index we published in the summer. The index has provoked some fierce reactions, both positive and negative. And I can definitely see if you have a low ranking and you think the pilot index has treated you unfairly, that you would be smarting at present.</p> <p>However, let me try and put the thing in context. First, let us look at where we were eighteen months ago when the Treasury were making assertions that there was a fivefold operating cost differential between the best performing and worst performing associations. At the same time, Peter Gershon was insisting that all providers look at how they could increase value from the public purse.</p> <p>It is these interventions that have influenced us to develop a full efficiency programme of which the pilot index is just one part. </p> <p>There are many good aspects of the index that we have developed through Indepen. It is based on real validated data provided by associations themselves. It reflects many key cost variables. And in comparing actual costs against predicted costs, it looks at each association on its own terms.</p> <p>The index was always intended as one PI, to be published alongside all the other PI data we collect. By itself, it does not tell us or you whether an association is either efficient or effective, but it does provide a potentially important piece of the jigsaw.</p> <p>Various people have accused us of getting different things wrong with the index. Some say we should have validated the index results individually and confidentially with each association, but that would have just created an index of special pleading with the integrity and logic of the approach lost or badly diminished. Others suggested we should have published the pilot list anonymously, but then how would we have learnt where the errors and difficulties lie. Yet others have suggested that there must be a measure of quality in the index but that would be mixing apple and pears. Rather, we must consider the data alongside other indicators such as inspection ratings to ensure a balanced cost and quality approach.</p> <p>One thing I will acknowledge we got wrong and we will now correct. As the National Housing Federation have stated in their considered response to the draft index, we should have not referred to this exercise as the efficiency index but rather to an operating cost index. I accept this criticism and we will make this change when we publish the 2004 results alongside the other PIs. From now, this exercise will be titled an operating cost index. At the same time we are, of course, also reflecting on other criticisms and suggestions that have been made. </p> <p>But all that said, I am a Yorkshireman and I am therefore, by nature, stubborn. The sector must become more efficient and it is part of our task to facilitate this process. There will be an index of operating costs for the foreseeable future and other indices and initiatives will follow under the general banner of efficiency. The agenda is not going away and neither are we. So I suggest we work in partnership on this one.</p> <p>Finally then, the demand of greater responsiveness to the needs of residents and here I can finish on some really good news. </p> <p>Later in the autumn we will be publish the full results of our periodic surveys of tenants and households in shared ownership. But let me share with you some early headlines. </p> <p>As a sector, 77% of your tenants are satisfied with your performance as landlords and 9 out of 10 shared owners are satisfied with their homes and neighbourhood. Only 20% of tenants are looking to move home in the next two years. 69% would like to be still renting from a housing association in ten years time, compared to 2% who would like to be renting from a council.</p> <p>Turning to shared ownership, 15% of new shared ownership sales are to BME households, and the average gross income of all shared ownership households is \u00a3400 per week, in other words, key worker territory. Particularly encouraging is that 51% of buyers were previously tenants and a further 24% had been living with parents, relatives and friends. We are therefore genuinely helping people into ownership for the first time.</p> <p>So well done on all that. But again no grounds for complacency. We can all improve, including the Corporation, on how we involve residents and how we learn from them how to improve services. To assist this, we are launching today the Routes to Involvement web-site, a dedicated resource for housing associations and their residents to access information and suggestions on how to begin, maintain and improve resident involvement. It is an 'electronic handbook' that will be updated over time. And you can test it out on our web-site on the HC stand tomorrow.</p> <p>Time for me to know my place and hand over to the main act. Let me though just summarise my remarks. In the constant battle to reconcile policy demands and resident needs, I want you to know that we are and remain committed to working with and through housing associations as a tried and tested means of meeting the housing needs of vulnerable people. </p> <p>We recognise you have strength in diversity, that many of you are cradles of innovation and creativity, and that most of you have managed your assets wisely over many years. Frankly, who would not want to work with such a sector?</p> <p>There are opportunities that lie ahead, in evolving our regulatory relationship to give greater freedoms where we can, in growing the investment programme and in taking the partnering relationship to another level.</p> <p>In representing the interests of residents and tax-payers, we will remain demanding. We will keep pushing for greater efficiency from the sector in pursuit of our efficiency targets, but not at the expense of quality of product and quality of service. And we will always remember, that, like you, our ultimate customers are the 2 million residents you serve and that we, Corporation and associations, are only intermediaries. Their interests will come first.</p> <p>So thank you for welcoming me to my first NHF conference as Chief Executive of the Corporation. I hope it will be the first of several. I want to work closely with the sector. We have the same goals. We will from time to time disagree. But that is only healthy. As the self-help guru Alexander Penney once said, \"The ultimate test of a relationship is to disagree but keep holding hands.\" My hands are open.</p>",
  "Russia today asked the UN to extend its list of international terrorists to include Chechen rebels. <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, urged the international community to treat the rebels in the same way it treats al-Qaida operatives.</p> <p>\"Those who slaughtered children in Beslan and hijacked aeroplanes to attack America are creatures of the same breed,\" he said in a forceful speech to the UN general assembly. </p> <p>\"Harbouring terrorists, their henchmen and sponsors undermines the unity and mutual trust of parties to the anti-terrorist front, serves as a justification for their actions and actually encourages them to commit similar crimes in other countries,\" he added. </p> <p>Russia also circulated a draft security council resolution that stressed the need for the 15 member nations to \"cooperate fully\" in tracking down the perpetrators and organisers of terrorist attacks.</p> <p>The proposed text would ask the committee that monitors what governments are doing to fight terrorism to consider ways of creating a new list of \"individuals, groups and entities involved in or associated with terrorist activities\". </p> <p>The list would be separate from the one setting out sanctions against al-Qaida and the Taliban, which was drawn up in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the US, according to a copy obtained by the Associated Press. </p> <p>The draft resolution also asked the committee to consider punishments including travel bans, freezing financial assets and \"expedited extradition of anyone named in the list\". </p> <p>The US was reviewing the proposal, said the secretary of state, Colin Powell, who met Mr Lavrov yesterday. </p> <p>The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, supported the initiative and said Britain would \"work closely\" with Russia on the wording to prevent terrorists from abusing asylum status. Russia has denounced countries for granting asylum to Chechen leaders it has linked to violence.</p> <p>\"We cannot let terrorists exploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not the persecutors,\" Mr Straw said. However, he stressed that no EU member state would return suspects to face the death penalty. </p> <p>UN diplomats said the resolution was likely to be formally introduced today. Mr Lavrov did not single out any countries in his speech but Russia was particularly upset by the granting of British refugee status to Akhmed Zakayev, an envoy for the Chechen rebel leader, Aslan Maskhadov, and US asylum to Ilyas Akhmadov, whom Mr Maskhadov named as his foreign minister while he was Chechnya's president in 1999. </p> <p>The development comes about three weeks after militants staged a series of attacks in Russia, including the hostage crisis at a school in Beslan, in which more than 330 people were killed.</p>",

  "<p>Cadbury Schweppes, the world's biggest confectioner, today forecast disappointing annual profits after a wet summer dampened drink sales in Europe.</p> <p>The maker of Dairy Milk in the UK is the latest food and consumer company in the sector to deliver downbeat news, after profit warnings from the global soft drinks giant Coca-Cola and the Anglo-Dutch foods group Unilever, a big seller of ice cream.</p> <p>\"Our European beverage business has had a more difficult summer than anticipated. This is in line with the industry as a whole where cold and wet weather in 2004 compares with record summer temperatures in 2003,\" Cadbury said in a statement. </p> <p>The company stressed, however, that its global confectionery businesses had continued to perform well. </p> <p>\"Although a significant proportion of our sales and profits are earned in the final three months of the year, we continue to expect to deliver financial results within our goal ranges, but toward the lower end,\" it said. </p> <p>Last October, Cadbury unveiled a four-year \"fuel for growth\" strategy aimed at making annual savings of \u00a3400m by 2007, and increasing sales by 3-5% a year. The plan involves closing about a fifth of the company's 133 factories worldwide and reducing its workforce by 10%. </p> <p>Cadbury employs 54,000, of whom about 7,000 work in the UK at eight sites including its chocolate factory at Bourneville in Birmingham. As well as the Dairy Milk range, its chocolate brands include Roses, Flake, Crunchie, Double Decker, Picnic, Turkish Delight and Boost. </p> <p>Today's market update was released in conjunction with an investor roadshow in the US and a visit by analysts to the company's Bournville site. Cadbury faces difficult conditions in the US, with increasingly health-conscious shoppers in the US failing to buy soft drinks with as much zeal as before. </p> <p>\"On balance the fundamentals of its business are not hugely appealing, given its largest profit centre [US beverages] is a market that is not growing,\" Andrew Saunders, an analyst with Numis, told Reuters. </p> <p>The company's continental European soft drinks business, which includes the Orangina fizzy orange brand, was boosted in 2001 by the acquisitions of Spanish soft drinks manufacturer La Casera and the continental European, North American and Australian soft drinks business of Pernod Ricard. </p> <p>Its carbonated soft drinks business in the US, which produces Dr Pepper, had continued to outperform the market, Cadbury said. </p> <p>In July, the group posted a 2% rise in first half underlying profits to \u00a3371m in the 24 weeks to June 13 and said it remained \"cautiously optimistic\" about the full year. </p> <p>Cadbury reported an encouraging performance in the UK, where the relaunch of its Dairy Milk range led to double-digit growth in sales of the chocolate bars. Cadbury's overhaul of the range last year saw products such as Crunchie, Fruit &amp; Nut and Caramel more closely tied together under the same branding.</p>",
  "For three decades the notebooks gathered dust in a cupboard, unknown to the world, forgotten even by their author, but cherished by the secret policeman who sensed history in their pages. As an apartheid agent Donald Card's job involved the decoding of confiscated writings of Robben Island prisoner 46664, to read between the lines about where the liberation movement was headed. <p>Except by the time he received the two books in 1971 Mr Card had lost faith in South Africa's white regime and so without telling anyone he locked away the private thoughts of Nelson Mandela in a cupboard at his home in eastern Cape. </p> <p>This week the two notebooks surfaced when the retired spy handed them over in an emotional ceremony of restitution which Mr Mandela said was the signal for a nationwide \"recovery of memory\". </p> <p>The books will remain private until Mr Mandela has read them. However, the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg yesterday revealed the contents of two pages, dated April 1 1971 and addressed to \"My dear Sisi\", believed to be a sister. </p> <p>Banned from political commentary, the author reminisced about escapades from his adolescence; whether he was trying to cheer up himself or his sister was not clear. </p> <p>\"Thinking about you and home does me lots of good. For most of the times such thoughts give me plenty of fun ... there was the unforgettable occasion when you scolded me for stealing green mealies from Reverend Matyolo's garden. You turned to me and said: 'Why do you disgrace us by stealing from a priest?' \" </p> <p>Mr Mandela recalled another occasion when his friend Justice fled after infuriating a clan chief, who then mistook the future statesman for the reprobate. \"I suddenly realised that I had been left to handle the baby.\" </p> <p>The author turned serious in paying tribute to a mentor, Chief Jongintaba. \"He inspired me to set goals for myself which I hope will be judged to be in accord with the interests of the community as a whole. Our hopes and aims centre around these ideals above all.\" </p> <p>This week the foundation also unveiled a previously unknown photograph of Mr Mandela gardening on Robben Island in 1977. Published here for the first time, the picture shows Mr Mandela with one hand on his hip, the other grasping a shovel. The future Nobel laureate wears a floppy hat, sunglasses and a scowl, furious at what he believed was an attempt by the apartheid regime to take his picture without permission and manipulate world opinion. </p> <p>The day guards guided journalists around the island the prisoners were given extra cartons of milk and an unusually soft job weeding but no chance to speak to the visitors. Mr Mandela, the star attraction, tried in vain to hide behind a bush. </p> <p>\"The reporters and cameramen stormed down upon us like excited visitors to an agricultural show,\" the prisoners wrote in a letter of complaint to the governor. Ironically the photograph was never used because Mr Mandela's image was banned and it was stored, forgotten, in the bowels of the state broadcaster SABC. </p> <p>But this week Mr Mandela welcomed the photograph as part of a trove of newly discovered archive material, especially the manuscripts, which he hoped would galvanise efforts to collect other lost fragments of the struggle. </p> <p>\"What you have just witnessed could be described as one old man giving another old man two old books,\" smiled the former president, and indeed the books were as worn and creased as their guardian and author. \"The history of our country is characterised by too much forgetting. The (notebooks) represent the hope that we can recover memories and stories suppressed by the apartheid regime.\" </p> <p>Adding up to 150 foolscap pages in fastidious, neat handwriting, the books comprised drafts of 79 letters written between 1969 and 1971 when Mr Mandela was barely into his 27-year jail term. </p> <p>\"These two manuscripts probably constitute the best primary source of Mr Mandela's thoughts and emotions at that time,\" said Cornelius Thomas, a historian who is the only person, besides Mr Card, to have read them. </p> <p><b> Letters</b><br> </p> <p> The remarkable tale of how they were safeguarded, and the reverence with which they were displayed yesterday, bore testimony to Mr Mandela's spell over South Africa. </p> <p>When contacted by Mr Card, Mr Mandela had no recollection of the red-bound black-covered books confiscated all those years ago. But after reading three letters he remembered. </p> <p>Letters from Robben Island could be no more than 500 words so Mr Mandela polished drafts in notebooks before sending them. But for security many were destroyed by recipients and others were burnt in a fire in Soweto in 1988, said Dr Thomas, who was commissioned by the foundation to authenticate the manuscripts. </p> <p>This dearth of documentation meant Mr Mandela's memoir Long Walk to Freedom skipped through 1969-1971 in under five pages, said the historian. \"These letters will now help nuance that period,\" said Dr Thomas. He would not elaborate beyond saying the author emerged as a man of faith and principle. </p> <p>A firm believer in apartheid, Mr Card was sent volumes of confiscated correspondence after recruiting an informant who offered to decode political meanings in apparently innocuous personal letters. </p> <p>However under the influence of the campaigning newspaper editor, Donald Woods, the policeman decided Mr Mandela was not a terrorist and resigned from the force in 1971. Because of an adminis trative error the correspondence continued arriving. </p> <p>Recognising the notebooks' value he hid them and after Mr Mandela's release in 1990 made several attempts to hand them over, finally succeeding when the foundation set up a centre of memory and commemoration and paid attention. </p> <p>The unspoken urgency is the former president's frailty. His spirits remain high but these days Mr Mandela, 86 and known universally and affectionately by his clan name Madiba, sits when he speaks. Aides have slashed his engagements since his retirement from public life this year. \"Don't call me, I'll call you,\" he said, and meant it.</p>",
  "So far this year, 11 women have killed themselves in jail, more than half of the number of prison suicides overall. Yet women make up only 20% of the prison population. They are 14 times more likely to self-harm than men. The overwhelming majority of women in prison have committed relatively minor crimes - mostly petty theft and drug offences - but their numbers in prison has doubled over the past decade and continues to grow. <p>Two-thirds of women in jail are the primary carers for children. Factor in the timebomb of potential delinquency presented by 17,700 children separated from what is usually their only resident parent and it is hard to conceive of a worse way of tackling crime than routinely locking up so many women. </p> <p>In addition, almost every prison structure - from privileges and punishments through to cognitive behavioural therapy - was designed with the male prisoners in mind. Studies show that instances of self-harm among women have actually increased after anger management and enhanced-thinking skills courses, where no such effect was detected among men. </p> <p>If we must lock up women - and in the majority of cases this in itself is profoundly questionable - we need to accept that the factors that bring them there, along with the pressures they face once incarcerated, are profoundly different to male prisoners' circumstances and must be accommodated in a different way. </p> <p>First, there needs to be an immediate reversal of the recent trend to lock up petty offenders (shoplifters, handlers of stolen goods, credit-card fraudsters) rather than give them fines or community service. There is absolutely no logic to this - recidivism proves far more likely following the breakdown of the offender's domestic arrangements. </p> <p>Second, sentencing for drug offences needs to be completely overhauled. As damaging as large-scale trafficking is to society, most female offenders are not in this league and are addicts themselves. Anyone with a serious interest in the long-term eradication of dependency would advocate rehabilitation over incarceration. </p> <p>Third, the arrangements for women awaiting trial, those awaiting sentencing after conviction and those awaiting judgment on refugee status, need to be reframed with the emphasis on imprisonment as a last resort, not a holding centre. </p> <p>Fourth, and most importantly, the fact that prison would separate an offender from her children must become the key consideration of sentencing. Judges must consider that a month of captivity for a sole carer is as harsh as a year or more for a non-parent. They must consider the likelihood of reoffending, where children are removed into care, and the grossly increased chances of those children offending in the future. It is interesting that judges have no trouble taking into account the needs of middle-class parents. There is almost certainly snobbery at work here, an assumption that single-parent status is somehow part of the offender profile, and can't therefore be taken into account. That needs to be changed. Judges have enormous powers of discretion in sentencing and they need to put them to better and wider use. </p> <p> <b> Summary</b> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Petty offenders to be fined or given community sentences rather than imprisonment. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> An overhaul in sentencing for drugs offences, with the emphasis on rehabilitation not incarceration. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> An overhaul in the remand and detention process, with imprisonment as a last resort. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Greater emphasis placed on children as a militating circumstance against custodial sentencing.</p>",
  "<b>Margaret Cook, author and retired consultant</b> <br> I wasn't invited to the victory party. Robin was swishing down there with his mistress, but I watched it on telly and thought it was great. I cancelled my party membership in 1998 when it became clear that Blair's style of government was very removed from socialism. He has not welcomed women into government. Gordon has more gravitas but he's emotionally constipated: I don't know that he empathises with women. Labour need a protracted spell in the wilderness. <p><b>Annie Brenton, 57</b><br> I will only get 70% of the full state pension, much less than my twin sister, because I had children earlier. I live in rural north Devon and the jobs that are available tend to be low-paid and part-time. I've always voted Labour and will do again, but the government does make women like me, on low incomes, feel like second-class citizens. </p> <p> <b>Carol Hayman, author of Hard Choices, a satire about women and New Labour</b><br> This government has been ruled from day one by a cohort of guys, and women have been forced to function as groupies. If Carole Caplin is the sort of woman Blair wants to spend a lot of time with - well, I rest my case. </p> <p><b>Antonia Byatt, director of the Women's Library at Metropolitan University</b><br> I've been pleased to see the investment in education, but pensions still need sorting, and it has been disappointing to see the prison population rise. I didn't get married and now I'm dismayed that, despite having a secure relationship and three children, I might have to get married to get the same rights as heterosexual and same sex married couples - and I don't want to!</p> <p><b>Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty</b><br> It meant something to see Blair surrounded by so many women - to see so many new faces of any kind. There's no question there have been positive noises and substantive measures in terms of gay and gender equality. But race equality is still held back by the policy and rhetoric on asylum.</p> <p><b>Kierra Box, co-founder of youth anti-war group Hands Up For Peace, 19</b><br> I still have the election night '97 video on my shelf. I thought we'd have a more diverse government, but parliament is still full of old white men.. This government has bypassed public opinion: they introduced top-up fees not because the argument had been won, but because they said they would, and the same goes for the war. I won't be keeping them in. </p> <p><b>Sandra Gidley, MP for Romsey and Liberal Democrat spokesperson for women, 47</b> I'm not sure the minister for women role serves a very useful purpose. It would be better if you had someone tasked with gender equality working in each ministry. I asked Patricia Hewitt how much time she spent on each of her portfolios [minister for women and the DTI], and she took a long time coming back to me. In the end she said the two were so intertwined it was impossible to know.</p> <p><b>Kat Fletcher, president of the National Union of Students, 24</b><br> The huge increases in student debt impact on women, who are more likely to be underpaid or to need to take time out in the future. Younger people are disengaged from the process of politics, not from politics itself. The scale of the anti-war movement was incredible, and much of that was student-based. The war and top-up fees have been the two most unpopular policies, but both were pushed through against the will of the people.</p> <p><b>Helen Vaughan-Jones, PR, 26 </b> <br> Women politicians tend to be concentrated in the arts, education and media. Brown, Blunkett, Prescott and Clarke are still the dominant media figures. Safety when travelling at night is a big issue for me; we need better public transport throughout the night, better street lighting.</p> <p><b>Diana Athill, author </b><br> I'm not really in the field to be affected by them any longer. Really, I'm so old. I voted for them - automatically, but unwillingly. I suppose they could have done something to make women's incomes more equal. I won't vote for them next time. The way Blair has been a lackey for America has been repulsive. I can't tell the difference between them now. I'm fed up with the lot of them. </p> <p><b>June Baptiste, domestic violence service manager, 41</b><br> They have put domestic violence on the agenda, but there should be stronger measures to protect women and children fleeing violence - the legal system needs to be improved and a stronger message given out that domestic violence is a crime.. Some police safety units are wonderful but others are not sympathetic; there needs to be a more joined-up approach.</p> <p>A lot of minorities felt Blair had our interests at heart he hasn't done enought to challenge right-wing stereotypes. Since 9/11 there has been an incredible awakening in Muslim political activism, and Muslim women have come into mainstream politics. This government's foreign policy has made us establish a sense of who we are, made us learn about our faith. </p> <p><b>Eleanor Laing, MP for Epping Forest and Conservative shadow minister for women</b><br> Most women will tell you that one of the things that concerns them most is fear of violent crime. Last week a man who murdered his girlfriend, the mother of his six-week-old child, was sentenced to 10 years. Only 10 years? How can people have confidence in a system like that? The emphasis on the number of women in parliament is a red herring: it's what they do, not where they are, that matters. </p> <p><b>Jeanette Winterson, author</b><br> I'll never forgive them about the war. It's not a women's issue, it's a world issue. I am buying a place in Paris because I no longer want to be in the UK full-time. I want to be European, not a piece of the USA.</p> <p><b>Dr Gillian Braunold, GP</b><br> Since more women have become GPs and chosen to work part-time, more men are, too. Then there is the removal of the duty to be on call out-of-hours. I think it would be deleterious if the profession was 100% female - we need to reflect society. Women in the public eye have to endure comments about their appearance and weight; nobody comments on how fat or well-groomed the men are.</p> <p><b>Amina Taylor, editor of Pride magazine</b><br> I had hoped Oona King, Diane Abbot, David Lammie, Paul Boateng could do something wonderful but I don't know that they have the power base. And I don't know how useful the whole ethnic umbrella is - black women in particular have unique and special concerns, and experiences of inequality. It bothers me that politics seems to have merged: if people want radical thinking they are more tempted to vote BNP or Ukip. </p> <p><b>Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington</b><br> In opposition we made a commitment to having a Ministry of Women. That was never implemented and so there was never a strong, clear voice for women at the heart of government. Cutting the benefits of single parents impacted badly on single mothers who didn't work and put them at an incredible disadvantage. </p> <p>The two main issues I would flag up for women would be pensions and the minimum wage. The failure to increase pensions in line with earnings has affected women disproportionately as they are less likely to have an occupational pension and are therefore more dependent on the basic pension. All the evidence suggests that many older people won't apply for means-tested benefits so the best way to lift women pensioners from poverty is to raise the basic pension. The minimum wage benefits women more than men as they are generally in lower paid jobs - the failure to put it up to a high enough level affects many women's lives<br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b>Interviews by Lucy Clouting, Melissa Denes, Laura Barton and Simon Hattenstone</b></p>",
  "<p>I had me a Proustian moment at the used-video store this week. I stumbled on a copy of the first movie I ever saw that had been blatantly and brutally cut. It was called Last Summer and I saw it late at night in maybe 1980, on the old Metromedia Five station in Washington DC that Rupert Murdoch later bought and used as a launchpad for the Fox network. </p> <p>Back then it played weekend-long movie marathons and Last Summer - adapted in 1969 by Frank and Eleanor Perry, who also made The Swimmer - rolled around just once, in the dead of night. I'd read the book by Evan Hunter and remembered a sleazy, exploitative scene at the end when a teenage girl goads two boys into raping another girl among the dunes on Fire Island. Come time for the rape, the station cut to commercials, and when they came back the credits were already rolling. I was used to British TV of the 1970s, a veritable cavalcade of knockers and duffings-up until Mrs T started waving that handbag. I knew Metromedia Five hacked movies to bits, but here the moment toward which the whole movie had been building was simply gone - it was amputation, not editing. </p> <p>Around the same time came the first network TV airing of the ice-hockey comedy Slap Shot, which offered another approach to making nasty, sweary movies palatable to five-year-olds. I believe this was a unique cultural moment, as it constituted the public debut of the word \"freakin'\", which the network superimposed over the original movie's every use of the more sensible f-word. Nowadays people use \"freaking\" in everyday speech in bars and on buses, the first instance I know of a network faux-obscenity taking on a life of its own. </p> <p>Movies like Slap Shot and The Last Detail (87 f-words) were among the first examples of what later became a thriving parallel universe: TV versions of foul-mouthed and violent movies. You haven't lived until you've seen Goodfellas cut for TV. All 250-odd obscenities are just gone, replaced by ridiculous euphemisms (\"melon-farmer\", indeed) and tin-eared pseudo-cussing. See The Usual Suspects on TV and the phrase \"you fucking cocksucker\" becomes \"you fairy godfather\", which, come to think of it, is no less homophobic. Die Hard gives us Bruce Willis in his wifebeater vest yowling \"Yippee-ki-yay, Mr Falcon!\" And so on. </p> <p>With uncensored movies, be they at the picture house or on cable stations like HBO, things are better, but censorship information in the US has expanded now to the point where it can actually interfere with the enjoyment of the product. An episode of say, Six Feet Under and any movie on HBO will be preceded by what I call the menu: a list of exactly what kinds of unpleasantness will be heavily featured in tonight's attraction. For example: \"Graphic violence, nudity, foul language, rape\" came before Dr Melfi was assaulted on The Sopranos, so they ruined that episode before it even started. Sometimes the list may extend to as many as seven gruesome items, with mutilation or torture added, until it feels like a full house in bingo. </p> <p>Movie posters and ads likewise have their own little box next to the rating, explaining the things mothers may wish to protect their sprogs from. Not having any sprogs myself I feel this is information I can do without but hey, I already saw the meagre fare on offer - \"Mild profanity, action violence, partial nudity\", blah - and it's already put a ceiling on my expectations. I know I won't be shocked or surprised, both of which rank high in my pantheon of cinema-going pleasures. The LA Times even adds its own spin on the rating at the end of reviews: \"Too intense for young children\" and so on, though I recall a wonderful misprint relating to some plasma-drenched Halloween hack-n-slasher: \"Gore. Beheadings. Elviscerations.\" </p> <p>I was talking about all this recently with Robert Parigi, who directed his first movie, Love Object, from his own script last year. We were bemoaning the censorious state of what we like to call \"Crybaby America\" and Love Object, a horror movie with lots of sexual deviancy, contains plenty to rile and unnerve that constituency. A splendidly macabre psychodrama about a Collectorish young tech writer and his lifelike sex-doll, it jabs innumerable hot buttons and combines perfectly judged black humour (\"You don't have to take a sex-doll to see The English Patient!\") with some deeply disturbing moments of degradation and sexual perversity. Yet its rating - \"R for violence, sexuality and language\" - scarcely hints at what's in store for the viewer in terms of mindbends and sweaty palms. </p> <p>Parigi is not as worried by TV censorship as he is by the new phenomenon of \"bespoke\" or \"DIY\" censorship as practiced by companies such as ClearPlay and Trilogy Studios. ClearPlay will mute, bleep, skip and jump its way through the horrid and naughty bits in any DVD you want altered, while Trilogy's MovieMask software digitally alters your DVD to accord with your own comfort level. You can reduce or remove entirely all sex, violence or language. You can expunge any \"vain reference to the deity\" or \"strong profanity\". You can cut all the bloodshed out of Saving Private Ryan without any dealings with, or permission from, Steven Spielberg or Dreamworks, who are naturally incensed. </p> <p>As an artist, Parigi reasons that, since this service is likely to proliferate, he is being caught at both ends of the process: by the ratings board, and by the end-user's local censorship service. This essentially puts his work in the hands of small-town busybodies, bluenoses and religious bigots, especially the latter, as the digital censorship software folks all reside in Utah or Colorado, white bastions of the religious right, and Love Object would send these people screaming for their assault rifles. If they're going to cut it up without Parigi's permission anyway, then he wonders why he even bothers to deal with the censor's exacting and tiresome demands in the first place. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Trilogy is negotiating with TiVo to see if MovieMask can be used to ruin more TV and movies than it already does. I'm reassured by one fact: the only movie Trilogy say they can't filter effectively is The Passion of the Christ. It would be like throwing away the turkey and keeping the wishbone.

  "<p>Hospital modernisation plans are being put on ice because ministers fear Kidderminster-style political revolts at the next election. </p> <p>Amid cries of political dishonesty from senior NHS managers, the government has told local trusts that it is the wrong time to proceed with proposals that might upset staff or patients in marginal constituencies, whatever the long-term advantage to public health. </p> <p>The moratorium shows ministers have learned the lessons of Labour's defeat in Wyre Forest at the last election, when the independent candidate Richard Taylor swept to victory on a protest vote against withdrawal of services from Kidderminster hospital. </p> <p>Last week John Reid, health secretary, stepped in during the Hartlepool byelection campaign to promise to reconsider plans for removing emergency surgery and consultant-led maternity and children's services from University hospital, Hartlepool. </p> <p>On Monday, a scheme to rationalise maternity and children's services in north London was put on the back burner to avoid protest from consultants at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead. </p> <p>According to a leaked email from the project leader, Rachel Tyndall, chief executive of Islington primary care trust: \"The Department of Health has indicated that a negative (public reaction) prior to a general election would not be acceptable.\" </p> <p>In Scotland, Labour MPs have told the Scottish Executive's health minister, Malcolm Chisholm, to \"get a grip\" on rationalisation schemes that threatened to provoke local revolts at the next election. </p> <p>In Scottish parliament elections last year, one campaigner, Jean Turner, a doctor, overturned a Labour majority to win the Stathkelvin and Bearsden seat on a platform to save a local hospital. </p> <p>The future of St John's hospital, in Robin Cook's Livingston constituency, is causing local concern, amid plans to relocate emergency surgery to the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Mr Cook has labelled the proposal as the \"economics of the madhouse\". </p> <p>And around the country, from the West Highlands to Ayrshire, other battles are breaking out. </p> <p>Nigel Edwards, policy director of the NHS Confederation, representing NHS managers and trusts, said: \"We are in the difficult position of only being able to change anything during an 18-month window between elections, or in safe seats. </p> <p>\"Whatever the politicians say, some of these changes are inevitable, particularly in maternity and paediatric services.\" </p> <p>The Department of Health's view was that NHS trusts should not need instruction from ministers about the danger of bringing forward controversial proposals close to an election when they could become a political football. </p> <p>Sir Nigel Crisp, NHS chief executive, said: \"Responsibility for designing local NHS services has been devolved to local NHS managers. It is up to them how they run local consultations and schedule potentially controversial decisions. It would not be appropriate for the Department of Health to intervene in this process. However, we offer advice to the NHS when asked.\" </p> <p>On Teesside, the hospital reorganisation plans were approved by an external panel in July. But the Department of Health ordered a re-think a month later, as the campaign gathered momentum for the byelection triggered by Peter Mandelson's appointment to the European commission. </p> <p>Tony Blair said last week: \"There is no question of the hospital closing or being run down.\" </p> <p>But a review of local services by the County Durham and South Tees strategic health authority, supported by the external panel and due to go out to wider consultation this month, has warned of increasing difficulty in maintaining services for the most seriously ill patients across two sites in the area - the University hospital of Harlepool and the nearby University hospital of North Tees. </p> <p>A briefing paper from the authority makes clear that consultation plans have been effectively put on hold as a result of the byelection. However, health professionals see no alternative to centralising emergency surgery and trauma services, complicated maternity cases and inpatient children's services at North Tees, with planned, or elective surgery staying in Hartlepool. </p> <p>One longer-term plan is to close both hospitals and build a new hospital. However, in a letter to Ken Jarrold, chief executive of the health authority a month ago, a senior Department of Health official asked for further research \"to see how the fullest possible range of services can be maintained in Hartlepool\" - including complicated maternity cases.</p>",
  "The world's highest ice fields are melting so quickly that they are on course to disappear within 100 years, driving up sea levels, increasing floods and turning verdant mountain slopes into deserts, Chinese scientists warned yesterday. <p>After the most detailed study ever undertaken of China's glaciers, which are said to account for 15% of the planet's ice, researchers from the Academy of Science said that urgent measures were needed to prepare for the impact of climate change at high altitude. </p> <p>Their study, the Glacier Inventory, was approved for publication last week after a quarter of a century of exploration in China and Tibet. It will heighten alarm at global warming. </p> <p>Until now, most research on the subject has looked at the melting of the polar ice-caps. Evidence from the inventory suggests that the impact is as bad, if not worse, on the world's highest mountain ranges - many of which are in China. </p> <p>In the past 24 years, the scientists have measured a 5.5% shrinkage by volume in China's 46,298 glaciers, a loss equivalent to more than 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) of ice; there has been a noticeable acceleration in recent years. </p> <p>Among the most marked changes has been the 500metre retreat of the glacier at the source of the Yangtze on the Tibet-Qinghai plateau. </p> <p>The huge volumes of water from the glacier's melted ice, estimated at 587bn cubic metres since the 1950s, are thought to have been a factor in flooding that has devastated many downstream areas in recent years. </p> <p>Shrinkages were observed at almost every ice-field in the Karakorum range, including the Purugangri glaciers, which are said to be the world's third largest body of ice after the Arctic and Antarctica. According to Yao Tandong, who led the 50 scientists in the project, the decline of the Himalayan glaciers would be a disaster for the ecosystem of China and neighbouring states. </p> <p>If the climate continued to change at the current pace, he predicted that two-thirds of China's glaciers would disappear by the end of the 2050s, and almost all would have melted by 2100. </p> <p>\"Within 20 to 30 years, we will see the collapse of many of the smaller glaciers,\" he said. \"Within 60 years, we can predict a very significant reduction in the volume of high-altitude ice fields.\" </p> <p>In the short term, he said, the water from the ice would fill reservoirs and lead to more flooding - as was already the case in Nepal and downstream areas of China. </p> <p>In the future, he predicted, the end of the glaciers would deprive the mountain ecology of its main life source and hasten the desertification that threatens western China, particularly in Gansu and Xinjiang provinces. </p> <p>Once the mountain ice was gone, rivers would start to dry up and ocean levels would rise, threatening coastal cities. </p> <p>The inventory confirms earlier studies of Everest, which showed the world's tallest peak more than 1.3 meters shorter than in 1953, when it was first scaled by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. </p> <p>To ease the impact of the glacial melt, the scientists plan to advise China's government to build more reservoirs and hydro-electric dams to improve downstream flood control. </p> <p>But they said that there were limits to what could be achieved. </p> <p>\"No one can reverse the changes to a glacier,\" said Shi Yafeng, head of China's environmental and engineering research institute for the cold and arid regions.</p>",
  "<b> Daily Mail </b> <br> Editorial, September 23 <p>\"Michael Howard's call for annual immigration quotas is eminently sensible.

His proposal for an annual quota on immigrants, set by parliament, is both sensible and fair. It works in Australia, where illegal immigration has been curbed and a points system is used to assess the claims of would-be settlers. Unlimited, uncontrolled immigration is bad for everyone.

  "You can always tell when Tory leaders are in trouble - they resort to playing the race card. But I hadn't realised that Michael Howard was in quite that much trouble. <p>On the evening news on Wednesday, the Prince of Darkness appeared in a carefully stage-managed walk towards the TV cameras to talk about immigration. On either side of him were respectable-looking black people chuckling along with him to send out the message: \"Of course our leader isn't a racialist, look here he is with some coloured chappies!\" No wonder they were laughing; Michael had just asked them if they were Tory MPs. </p> <p>This embarrassing gap in the Conservative benches made setting up this photo opportunity a nightmare. At the planning meeting, Oliver Letwin and Theresa May helpfully offered to black up and hum songs from Motown's Greatest Hits. \"No, that won't work, Theresa, the press might notice that you don't have a natural sense of rhythm.\" \"I could be eating rice and peas ... \" suggested Oliver, \"and talk about how good I am at sport.\" </p> <p>In the end they found some black Conservatives that they'd managed to keep as party members by desperately preventing them from ever meeting the rest of the grassroots Tory membership (who probably would have screamed and called security). </p> <p>The Conservative party has come a long way since the days of Enoch Powell. It has to be much more subtle these days; Tories have learned to start by saying: \"I'm not a racist but ... \" \"Yeah that's great, Michael. But can we try it again, but this time without the pointy white hood and the burning cross in the background ... \" However, the core message is still the same: \"If you don't like all these immigrants, we're the party for you.\" </p> <p>At a time when the number of asylum seekers entering Britain is at its lowest point since 1997, the Tory leader chose to go on the offensive about immigration - \"offensive\" being the operative word. He advocated a quota system to set a limit on the number of immigrants and asylum seekers entering the country, which would certainly make for some tense scenes at Harare airport. </p> <p>\"Hello, I'm from British Airways, I'm afraid this flight to London is overbooked - would you be willing to be put on tomorrow's flight instead?\" </p> <p>\"No, you see if I don't get on this plane right now, I'll just miss the cut-off point for Britain's asylum quota, and be sent back to Zimbabwe and certain execution ... \" </p> <p>\"Right, not even if we offer you a glass of bucks fizz and some complimentary travel vouchers ... \" </p> <p>Maybe the RNLI could have a quota for the number of sinking trawlers they rescue. Our hospitals are under a lot of pressure; how about a limit on the number of emergency resuscitations? \"I'm sorry we can't send out the ambulance, we reached our annual quota of lives saved back in August ... \" </p> <p>The curious thing about this week's pitch for the anti-immigration vote is that even from the basest Machiavellian point of view, it was not even good politics. In a week when the focus was on the Liberal Democrats (the greatest threat to Tory marginals), Howard chose to lurch to the right in an attempt to shore up the votes that he is losing to the UK Independence party and the BNP. If you are going to sell your soul, you should at least try to get a decent price for it. </p> <p>When Howard first took over the ailing Tory party, some of us feared that the Conservatives might finally be getting a competent leader to lift their pitiful poll ratings. Of course, we should have trusted the verdict of those who knew him best. Tory MPs gave their judgment in 1997, the last time Howard actually had to fight a leadership election. I suppose coming fifth isn't so bad, even if there were only five candidates. But his own party decided he was less appealing than John Redwood, less charismatic than Peter Lilley, less of a fresh face than Kenneth Clarke and less likely to win an election than William Hague. So in 2003 he was the only candidate - and this time they thought they'd better not risk a vote in case he still didn't win it. </p> <p>But this week marked a new low point in Michael Howard's fading political career; he demonstrated that his integrity is even lower than his charm rating. The presenters of Blue Peter can feel that much more secure that he won't be getting any of their jobs. More significantly, he showed that he just doesn't have the skill or judgment required for the one he has at the moment. What greater case could there be for welcoming more foreigners to our shores? We desperately need immigrants so that challenging jobs such as leader of the opposition can be done properly. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Michael Howard's extreme new line on asylum and immigration played well in the red top newspapers. It was meant to. Ignore the protestations of innocence by the Tory leader in his interview on BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday. Look instead at facts and history. At the beginning of this month Liam Fox, party chairman, was reported to have declared: \"The number one issue to get Ukip voters back to the Conservatives is immigration and asylum. If we had a tougher line on immigration and asylum, they would come back.\" Hey presto, and much to the anger of Ukip, Mr Howard responded on Wednesday. The new policy package parallels Ukip's, with a cap on economic migrant numbers and a points scheme under which people would be selected on the basis of their skills. More serious, Mr Howard said a Tory government would pull out of the international convention on refugees and derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits deporting asylum seekers to countries where people are at risk of torture. <p>There may be some fair-minded people who still believe that Mr Howard is not playing the race card. Let them remember the interview in which Andrew Lansley, Tory MP and former election strategist, enthused to the Observer in the run up to the 2001 election that immigration had played well in the tabloids in both the 1992 Westminster election and the Euro elections two years later, and still had \"the potential to hurt\". Thankfully that proved wrong in the 2001 election when the Tory party was trounced. Hopefully, the insidious tactic will be equally unsuccessful in the next election, despite the jubilation it raised in yesterday's anti-immigrant press: \"Why Howard had to speak out\" (Mail), \"Honest Talk\" (Sun), \"Time to close the gates\" (Express). </p> <p>Contrary to Mr Howard's assertion the asylum system has not become \"chaotic, unfair and out of control\". Far from it. The UK has cut the overall number of asylum applicants by 70% since October 2002. This followed Tony Blair's demand for an arbitrary cut, which was in breach of the 1951 Geneva convention, but at least he stayed in. It was under Mr Howard's term as home secretary that 30,000 asylum seekers were left on the shelf for years leading the UN high commissioner for refugees to describe the UK system as the worst procedure in Europe. Far from signalling serious political leadership, this week's speech from Mr Howard smacks of desperation as his own and his party's position in the polls continue to stagnate. They deserve to.</p>",
  "Police have launched an investigation after up to 40 white pupils took to their school playground shouting \"Pakis out\" after racial tensions at the school boiled over. <p>Police said the chanting is the focus of their investigation into the Parkside community technology college in Plymouth, Devon. </p> <p>An anti-racism group helping parents said when the racist chanting had started, teachers \"herded\" around 20 ethnic minority children into a classroom for their own safety, before sending them home early. </p> <p>The parents of at least eight ethnic minority pupils are refusing to send their children to school, fearing that they will not be safe. </p> <p>The chanting happened on Wednesday lunchtime at the school in the Devonport area. </p> <p>Anti-racism campaigners say children of asylum seekers at the school have been suffering persistent attacks for months, and that Wednesday's events were the most stark manifestation of those tensions. </p> <p>They say the incident started when a white and African-Caribbean girl got into a fight, which was broken up. </p> <p>An hour later up to 40 white pupils took to the playground. Local residents said they had heard racist chanting. </p> <p>Plymouth council said 10 pupils, believed to be white and involved in the racist abuse, had been sent home and had now been suspended. </p> <p>John McKenzie of the Plymouth-based Rural Racism Project said Iraqi Kurdish, Palestinian and Afghani pupils had previously suffered racial violence at the 300-strong school, where around 10% of the children are from ethnic minorities. </p> <p>He said some incidents had not been reported to the police. Numerous children had complained to his organisation, some beaten so badly they required hospital treatment. </p> <p>Mr McKenzie added that the Devonport area was the focus for activity in the city by the extreme rightwing British National party. </p> <p>\"The school has failed significantly to discharge its duty of care to all pupils,\" he said, adding that the parents who were keeping their children out of school \"have no confidence the school can keep their children safe\". </p> <p>Police will examine CCTV footage from cameras at the school to try to establish what happened. </p> <p>Sergeant Alan Mobbs from Devon and Cornwall police said: \"It appears that there was some sort of racial chanting going on, directed at these children. </p> <p>\"It is being dealt with as a racial incident.\" </p> <p>In a statement Plymouth city council said: \"The incident involved a group of pupils and the matter was dealt with quickly by staff. At no stage was the school closed. </p> <p>\"Racism of any sort will not be tolerated in any of our schools. </p> <p>\"This incident will be fully investigated in close liaison with other agencies and appropriate action will be taken once the full facts have been established.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Jacques Villeneuve stood down from BAR-Honda with one race to go in the 2003 season, he had been worn out by the political machinations that had surrounded the team since its foundation five years earlier. </p> <p>Last week, clearly revitalised by almost a year away, the 1997 world champion signed two contracts with two formula one teams within 24 hours, guaranteeing his long-term return to the grand prix scene. </p> <p>Villeneuve concluded a deal to replace Jarno Trulli at Renault for the last three races of this season, starting with Sunday's inaugural Chinese grand prix in Shanghai. Then, after getting back into the swing of things, he will join the Sauber team on a two-year contract starting with the 2005 Australian grand prix. </p> <p>When the 33-year-old Canadian turned out at Silverstone last week for his first test run in the Renault, his temperament seemed transformed. Gone was the surly and preoccupied angry young man who invariably seemed to be embroiled in a spat with the BAR management. In his place was a mellow and calm individual more akin to the Indianapolis 500 winner who arrived at the Northamptonshire track eight years ago for his first drive in a formula one Williams-Renault. </p> <p>\"I'm very relaxed,\" he said after going through his routine technical debrief with the engineers. \"There's no reason to be anything else but relaxed. There's nothing to lose, no negativity, nothing. Initially I was struggling slightly with a loose seat, so I was rather hanging off the steering wheel. But we quickly fixed that.\" </p> <p>Villeneuve admitted that he had needed the break. He had driven for the BAR-Honda team for five years, initially under the direction of his own personal manager, Craig Pollock, who had shaped the team around the ambitions of his protege. But a shortage of results had led to British American Tobacco, the title sponsor and part owner of the team, replacing Pollock with David Richards, who quickly concluded that Villeneuve's $18m (\u00a310m) annual contract was a luxury he could well do without. </p> <p>\"Initially I was happy to get away from all this,\" he said. \"There had been five years of political games, not with the mechanics or the engineers but with all the other side. It was always negativity coming out and at the end of the day, even if you yourself want to be positive, it does come out in many ways. It was just a rolling snowball which was getting bigger and bigger, so the break was a good thing.\" </p> <p>He admits that the need to recharge his batteries was so pressing that he hardly took any notice of last year's Japanese grand prix, where he was replaced as Jenson Button's team-mate by the local ace Takuma Sato, who kept the drive this season. </p> <p>\"Initially I didn't think about it,\" he said. \"For Suzuka, I was back home and watched the race, so I didn't feel bad about that. I spent the winter playing ice hockey for my own personal satisfaction which gave me my adrenalin rush, not on a professional basis but just for my own enjoyment. Then [the season started] and I watched, of course sometimes thinking 'What could I have done there?'\" </p> <p>On the subject of Button, his old team-mate and rival, Villeneuve was full of praise for the effort which has carried the British driver to his third place in the world drivers' championship, behind the unassailable Ferrari team-mates Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello. </p> <p>\"Jenson has done a fantastic job,\" he said. \"It would have been difficult to have done better than he has done this year. Maybe he is leaving because of the political aspects, I don't know, because he was always highly protected within the team. But in going to Williams he's going back where he started, so there should be no surprise there. He obviously feels he will do better there, which is the only thing that matters.\" </p> <p>Looking towards the future he feels confident that his deal with Peter Sauber's team will yield worthwhile results. \"I was impressed with their facilities, particularly their new state-of-the-art wind tunnel,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Obviously the Ferrari engines [in the Saubers] are strong and their whole attitude was very positive. They want to make a step forward and are obviously very determined to raise their game. I'm feeling very optimistic about it.\" </p> <p>It is a testimony to Pollock's negotiating skills that Villeneuve's burning competitive spirit has driven him back towards the cockpit of not one but two formula one cars. </p> <p>Villeneuve added: \"Why come back? Simple, because I'm a racer. I started training in March, which was difficult when you haven't got a specific drive in mind. But I worked at it, and testing the Renault proved that it had been the right thing to do. </p> <p>\"Speeds are a lot faster, that's the biggest change. That's where the training paid off, I hope. Silverstone is the most physical track, muscle-wise, so if I can get through that for two days of testing I don't think I should have a problem.\" </p> <p>For the moment, his priority is to help the established driver Fernando Alonso move Renault back into second place in the constructors' championship, behind Ferrari but ahead of BAR-Honda. \"That's what I'm here for,\" said Villeneuve. \"And it would certainly be nice. Yes, it would be nice.\" </p> <p><strong>The highs and lows</strong></p> <p><strong> Early years </strong><br> </p> <p> Born on April 9 1971 at St-Jean-sur-Richelieu in Canada, the son of the Ferrari formula one driver Gilles Villeneuve, who died at Spa in 1982. </p> <p>Spends two years competing in formula three and one in formula Atlantic. </p> <p><strong> Rise </strong><br> </p> <p> Rookie of the year in 1994 in the Cart series in the United States, and takes the championship the following year.
