  "France and Spain called for a rethink yesterday on radical German-Italian plans to set up a European Union transit camp in north Africa for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. <p>Their objections came at the end of a two-day summit in Florence held by interior ministers from the big five EU countries, including the home secretary, David Blunkett. </p> <p>Britain first raised more than a year ago the idea of an EU-funded transit camp where asylum-seekers could be processed before they reached the border of the EU. The intention was, in part, to try to combat illegal trafficking that has seen thousands drown in the Mediterranean. </p> <p>\"We do not want to accept camps or centres of any kind,\" the French interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, said yesterday at a press conference at the end of the summit. \"It is not for Europe to take this issue forward.\" </p> <p>France, backed by Spain, wants the UN High Commission for Refugees to take responsibility rather than the EU. A French government official said the idea of a transit camp failed to address the root causes of migration, which required development aid, would be legally complex to set up and would be a magnet for human traffickers. </p> <p>The issue is to go to a meeting of all 24 EU members next week. </p> <p>Many of the illegal immigrants end up in Italy because of its proximity to North Africa. About 5,000 people are estimated to die each year attemping the crossing. Many of the refugees are from Morocco, Sudan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Authority. </p> <p>The issue became headline news in Germany when the crew of a German ship was arrested in Italy for saving 37 African migrants at risk of drowning in a rubber dinghy. </p> <p>\"We cannot leave things as they are now,\" the German interior minister, Otto Schily, said yesterday. \"We should offer these immigrants, before they embark on a very risky journey, advice on whether they qualify for protection.\" He added: \"No consensus has been reached.\" </p> <p>The likely location for the transit camp is Tunisia. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said of the Florence summit: \"We welcome these discussions and anything that moves on the debate about tackling illegal immigration to the EU.\" </p> <p>She said: \"We agree there is a pressing need to tackle flows of illegal immigration at source, working with countries of origin and transit. This includes cooperating with countries in north Africa to address the hazardous practice of crossing the Mediterranean into the EU.\" </p> <p>She added: \"This is not about creating 'Fortress Europe'. EU leaders have consistently reiterated the EU's tradition of protecting those genuinely in need. But we must deal firmly with those who seek to abuse our immigration procedures, and fight smuggling by organised criminals.\" </p> <p>The ministers did back plans to introduce biometric identification for EU passports from as early as 2006. </p> <p>The Home Office is at present sending teams round the country to test preferences for fingerprinting, facial or iris identification.</p>",
  "<p>The price of oil hit record highs yesterday amid signs it is encouraging the energy industry to move into previously shunned areas for exploration such as Peru. </p> <p>American crude reached $55.33 per barrel on the global market but then slumped 3% as traders took profits after evidence emerged that high energy costs are taking their toll on economic growth. Brent crude in London fell $1.46 to $48.86. </p> <p>Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had warned last Friday that increased oil prices had made a \"notable\" impact on US gross domestic product. </p> <p>Fears about growing winter demand encouraged the price of crude to rise yesterday to $55 - $11 higher than in the middle of last month. </p> <p>US production in the Gulf of Mexico is still less than 75% of its normal rate because pipelines and platforms have been damaged by storms such as Hurricanes Ivan and Charley which have repeatedly hit the area recently. This has prevented refiners building up supplies ahead of the winter. </p> <p>The continued high price of crude - and predictions it could stay at these levels for some time to come - has encouraged the majors to spend much more on exploration and production. </p> <p>It has also triggered interest in countries previously shunned for their political risk profile or questionable geography. </p> <p>Gold Oil, a tiny new Aim-listed company, yesterday revealed it was the latest foreign firm to sign an agreement with PeruPetro, the state owned oil group in Lima. </p> <p>Gold, formed in July, has been given a huge swath of acreage in the Sechura Basin in the north of the country. </p> <p>It has got permission to evaluate the region - the size of 14 North Sea blocks - but then turn it into a formal exploration contract. </p> <p>Gold believes it can find oil or gas in this desert area and has signed a memorandum of understanding with MAN Ferrostaal of Germany to see whether a petrochemical plant could be constructed in northern Peru. </p> <p>The government has been struggling to entice foreign firms to join the search for oil and gas. </p> <p>It has made the terms for engagement more attractive and Occidental Petroleum recently signed up to explore in the east of the country. </p> <p>American group Hunt Oil also recently won environmental approval to build a gas liquefaction plant in Peru. </p> <p>Another poor Latin American country - Bolivia - has also been attracting more interest from western energy companies over recent months.</p>",
  "I complain a lot (in my own time ...) about the proliferation of stories concerning IVF and fertility in general, since I can generally detect a conservative and/or misogynistic subtext to them, a niggling \"you can't have it all, girls\" message in every anecdotal conception trauma dressed up as news. But at the very least, you can find a correlation between the rising prominence of IVF in the news agenda and its increasing occurrence in the health service. <p>The number of women having IVF each year has reached the region of 30,000. Regardless of the spin you put on their individual stories (selfish, NHS-draining feminist hellcats or regular people having a medical procedure?), their number is substantial enough to warrant a place in cultural debate. </p> <p>The same couldn't be said for \"the young career women who are putting motherhood on ice\", a story from the weekend papers about women who are freezing their eggs so they have time to have a career and find a perfect mate, rather than getting a career, then settling for the first chap who comes along with passable motility. </p> <p>This was trumpeted with remarkable prominence in the Independent on Sunday. Clinics \"around the country\" were reporting \"increasing numbers\" of women who chose the freezing for \"lifestyle\", rather than medical, reasons. It sounds like a bit of a trend, doesn't it, something to maybe keep an eye on, if only from an anthropological point of view. You have to dive in a really committed way into the text before you get to any figures. </p> <p> By \"around the country\" they mean that nine clinics are offering this treatment. By \"increasing numbers\", they mean that eight out of 26 women, in the instance they gave, were undergoing it for lifestyle reasons. If each clinic has the same number of ball-busting, career-loving lifestyle-seekers, that is still only 72 women. In the whole of Great Britain. I bet there are more women who practise fish taxidermy, who go naked curling, who re-enact famous battles of the English civil war every weekend. </p> <p>The egg-freezing business might lack the spontaneity that some fondly attach to the miracle of birth, but if this is a trend, then so is a polyester bed-jacket with puppies appliqued on to the collar. You can do this with practically any birth-based \"craze\" you come across in the media - the women who leave it too late to find a partner and then engage in \"sperm banditry\" (conceiving without checking whether it's OK with the sperm manufacturer); the women who leave it a little bit late, then have a premature menopause and find it's suddenly way too late. Always skip to the figures: most of the time, they barely count as a handful. </p> <p>If you file the nuts and bolts of conception under \"personal choice\", it all seems very strange. Personal choices obviously do make the news, but only if a lot of people are making the same ones. If, on the other hand, you file unusual conception methods under \"crime or misdemeanour\", their status in the agenda suddenly makes sense. Aberrant behaviour doesn't need the meat of numbers to make it interesting, it's interesting all on its own. These stories can only loom so large on the landscape if the subtext exists that they are unnatural, wrong and, crucially, a matter of public rather than private interest. </p> <p>The boundary between public and private can't get any more blurred than it does in childbirth. The law takes it as given that, at a certain point in gestation, the foetus has rights distinct from those of its parents and at that point, any choices made by said parents could no longer be called \"personal\". But the law at least has the grace to formalise that boundary: to determine a time at which abortion is no longer permissible, to establish the furthest acceptable limits of genetic engineering, and so on. </p> <p>The media has no such compunction. It simply decides, according to nothing more rigorous than whim, the point at which a woman's choice becomes a matter of public interest. It then magnifies those choices until they seem ludicrously prevalent to avoid the obvious question we might otherwise ask: \"Why are you banging on about this so much?\" </p> <p>The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that, for all the lip service paid to a woman's right to choose, there is still deep-seated reluctance to cede fertility control to the individual. Unless, of course, that individual happens to be male. In that case, he could be laying down sperm for the future in the freezers of his local KwikSave. Not until it was such a trend that there was no room for the fishfingers would you hear a squeak about it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:zoe_williams @ntlworld.com\">zoe_williams @ntlworld.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Pre-match abuse</strong> \"Who is Rob Smythe?\" asks Paula Willow, correctly observing that I've been spelling my name wrong these past 28 years. \"Where's my Barry Glendenning? What's going on?\" Well, in a groundbreaking development, Barry's on holiday and, erm, Ben and I are doing the games instead.</p> <p><strong>Just the seven changes this time for Sir Alex</strong> Carroll; G Neville, Brown, Silvestre, Heinze; Miller, Scholes, O'Shea, Giggs; Rooney, Van Nistelrooy.</p> <p><strong>Sparta Prague team</strong> Blazek, Pergl, Kovac, Homola, Petras, Poborsky, Sivok, Zelenka, Urbanek, Jun, Vorisek. Subs: Bicik, Meduna, Michalik, Cech, Simak, Koubsky, Pacanda. </p> <p><strong>Random observations</strong> The problem of the current United side is summed up in this team. Whereas three years ago the midfield axis was set in stone, now we have a completely new midfield from the one that started at Birmingham on Saturday. Interestingly, Ferguson trusts Scholes in a 4-4-2 - though not alongside Keane, interestingly - and so Scholes and Rooney start together for the first time at club level.</p> <p><strong>More preamble</strong> \"Is it me, or is Liam Miller actually a bit rubbish?\" says Gez Medinger. \"Can't really see him marauding down the right wing tonight...\"</p> <p><strong>Silvestre?</strong> \"Am I the only United fan who breaks into a cold sweat when Silvestre's name appears on the sheet?\" asks Rupert Deaglan. \"Never mind the Heskeyesque tackling of the last six months, what about that 15 minute kip he's been taking every second half for the last four years?\" Point taken, but between around April 2003 and January 2004 Silvestre and Ferdinand were largely imperious. Indeed Fergie was cooing about them being the new Bruce and Pallister. But Silvestre has regressed since then: I'd have Brown and Ferdinand, when everyone's fit. But then I haven't won the Treble and conquered a long-standing dynasty both north and south of the border.</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> We're off. Prague, in purple, kick from right to left. United, in white, don't.</p> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Nearly a penalty for Sparta inside the first minute - Scholes brings his man down <em>that</em> far outside the box, and the ref's decision was spot on. Urbanek's free-kick wasn't.</p> <p><strong>4 min</strong> Thus far, it's as untidy as my hair before I got it chopped for the first time in about four months today. Not a moment too soon, I can tell you. \"Chat-up lines,\" says David Tetlow. \"Re: your desperate plea for action with reticent young lady - 'I mentioned you on the internet'. I call that abuse of power.\" I call it an option I might just have to use.</p> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Good break from United. Scholes curved a lovely ball in behind for Rooney, who'd timed his run well. But Rooney's square ball fell behind the unmarked Van Nistelrooy and was smuggled away for a corner.</p> <p><strong>7 min</strong> Lovely, twisting run from Giggs - the same Giggs I argued was finished earlier today - wins a corner.</p> <p><strong>9 min</strong> \"Mr Smyth - where did Barry go on holiday?\" asks Paula Willow. No idea. \"Somewhere warm?\" No idea. \"Is he stretched out on a beach, in a tight pair of speedos and smeared in baby oil?\" Is this you in disguise, Glendenning?</p> <p><strong>10 min</strong> Poborsky's corner is cleared to the edge of the box, where Vorisek slams a terrific volley goalwards. Scholes deflects it away for another corner. Lively stuff so far; surprisingly open for the early stages of a European game.</p> <p><strong>11 min</strong> \"Rooney's lovely eyebrows,\" coos Peter Dreary. Then Rooney feeds Giggs on the left; he faffs for a while before driving it diagonally across the face, where Van Nistelrooy misses his kick. A half-chance.</p> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Interesting that Darren Fletcher is not even in the XVIII tonight. I really thought this would be his breakthrough season, and I can't quite fathom why it isn't, to be honest.</p> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Poborsky skins Heinze like a potato, or even a cat, and at the other end Scholes almost plays Rooney in one-on-one. This is good stuff so far.</p> <p><strong>18 min</strong> Lovely pass down the line from Scholes, who has conducted the tempo excellently so far, but Giggs hits his man with the cross.</p> <p><strong>20 min</strong> \"Wo ist Ronaldo?\" asks Tariq Choudry. \"Have Rooney and Ronaldo started a game together?\" Middlesbrough. I think. And Arsenal.</p> <p><strong>23 min</strong> Like a warbling drunk who's passed out after his 17th double whisky, this game has quietened down now.</p> <p><strong>24 min</strong> Zelenka misses a great chance. He picked a loose ball up on the edge of the area, danced past Brown superbly and - with just Carroll to beat - dragged his shot wastefully across the face and wide. Best chance of the match, by quite a way.</p> <p><strong>29 min</strong> I'm bored now: the early mischief and openness has gone, and instead United are struggling for fluidity while being sporadically run ragged by players I've never heard of. And Poborsky.</p> <p><strong>31 min</strong> United try to repeat the famous goal at Bradford in 2000. Giggs pings a corner deep to Scholes, thirty yards out, and he sweet-spots his volley twn yards wide.</p> <p><strong>32 min</strong> Kovac is booked for taking out Van Nistelrooy.</p> <p><strong>33 min</strong> I've just realised that Liam Miller is on the pitch. Honestly, he's had less of a kick than a 7-Up chaser. \"How can you not know where Barry went on holiday?\" says Paula Willow. \"Aren't you friends? Don't you talk? Did he go on his own...?\" I think he went to New York, Paula...</p> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Michael Owen has scored a goal!</p> <p><strong>39 min</strong> Rooney launches one from 25 yards that is deflected an inch or two wide with the keeper rooted to the spot. \"Tell Ms Willow that Barry has gone to Butlins in Skegness for the weekend,\" says Richard Bartley.</p> <p><strong>42 min</strong> Rooney almost scores again. Brilliant carpe-diem play from Heinze, who intercepts a scooped pass from the goalkeeper Blazek and squares for Rooney, who clips it just wide, this time of the other post.</p> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Great chance for Sparta. Another loose ball broke eight yards out for Poborsky, who thumped it towards the top corner, only for Carroll to flap it wide. Fine save. From the resulting corner, Jun's flying header batters off the outside of the post.</p> <p><strong>Half time</strong> Troubling stuff for United, who could be three down really. The plus was the performance of Scholes - his best so far this season.</p> <p><strong>Who <em>is</em> Paula Willow?</strong> \"I think your initial call was right,\" says Matthew Cobb. \"I think Paula Willow <em>is</em> Barry Glendenning. If you Google her, the only times she pops up are on pages with Glendenning. You never see them apart, it appears...\"</p> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Like the bananas in my local Sainsbury's, they're off again. \"43 min,\" says Tim Edwards. \"As I salivated over my pan fried Red Snapper, fresh organic potatoes and a sprinkling of fresh parsley, it occurred to me that Liam Miller looks every ounce the overrated crock he was at Celtic.\" Doesn't a crock usually have something in it?</p> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Plenty of possession for United at the start of the second half, but to little avail. Then Sparta get the first chance, Poborsky almost lobbing a volley over the back-pedalling Carroll. Sparta still carry the greater thrust from midfield.</p> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Vorisek cracks a swinger - a swinging shot, that is - from range that dips and bounces awkwardly in front of Carroll, who held on well. United still aren't really at the races. </p> <p><strong>54 min</strong> \"Bananas,\" says Rob Hamilton. \"Do you prepare these jokes during quiet moments as the day passes? Was the sports desk REALLY that slow today?\"</p> <p><strong>58 min</strong> Sparta are having a really good spell here, as the lone striker Jun wins another corner and my unresponsive mouse ushers me ever closer to the Priory.</p> <p><strong>60 min</strong> Half-chance for the still listless Van Nistelrooy. Excellent first-time ball from Miller and the Dutchman, who had a yard, chested it back into trouble. Two years ago that would have been touch, kapow!, goal.</p> <p><strong>61 min</strong> A low-trajectory cross from Rooney is jabbed onto the roof of the net by John O'Shea. A good effort, and seconds later his fellow Irishman Miller is booked for crunching Urbanek.</p> <p><strong>62 min</strong> United are coming into this more now: Rooney slides a through ball for Giggs, who is <em>just</em> beaten to it by the keeper. That yard of pace makes all the difference.</p> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Ryan Giggs whaps a right-footed volley miles wide from 25 yards.</p> <p><strong>71 min</strong> Another excellent save from Carroll. Simple move: straight ball, flick on and Silvestre was brushed aside too easily by Jun, whose close-range finish was forced wide the keeper.</p> <p><strong>72 min</strong> \"Minute-by-minute is not strictly true, is it Rob?\" asks someone whose email I've huffily deleted.</p> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Scholes is booked for leaving his foot in on Kovac after the ball went for a goal-kick. A farcically soft booking, as Michal Meduna replaces the impressive Jun up front.</p> <p><strong>76 min</strong> Here's Josh Davis: \"Are you possibly using this commentary as a means to promote your journalistic excellence, by proving your article from earlier today, as a step along the way to complete and total world domination? If so, do you need any servile lackeys?\" Isn't Josh Davis DJ Shadow's real name? You're right, by the way: United are actually 4-0 up - Giggs, Scholes, Keane and Beckham the scorers.</p> <p><strong>77 min</strong> \"They generally score a goal,\" opines Peter Dreary. A few years ago an ITV commentator opined that Manchester United \"always score\". Times have changed, but here comes my hero Ronaldo, which has to be good news for all concerned.</p> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Double change: Saha and Ronaldo for Giggs and Mr Rooney.</p> <p><strong>81 min</strong> Dancing feet from Ronaldo, and here's Nick Waller: \"Apparently you are a dead ringer for Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame.....is this true?\" Er, no. But I do a mean Dennis Pennis, if the QPR fan is some random Shepherd's Bush pub last Saturday is to be believed.</p> <p><strong>82 min</strong> Jan Simak - an unwelcome reminder for United fans of Leverkusen 01/02 - on for the impressive Zelenka.</p> <p><strong>83 min</strong> I wonder when United last drew back-to-back games 0-0. Anyone?</p> <p><strong>83 min (again)</strong> Controversy there: Vorisek went down, but United played on and Ronaldo's skimmer was palmed wide.</p> <p><strong>84 min</strong> Ronaldo misses a great chance. Van Nistelrooy, fed in the inside-right channel by Neville,span and whacked a great ball across the face of goal, but Ronaldo could only instinctively kab it into Blazek's hands.</p> <p><strong>88 min</strong> Ronaldo falls over like a drunk on a dance floor right on the edge of the box. Free-kick in a very dangerous position.</p> <p><strong>89 min</strong> Ronaldo's kick hits the top of the wall, and then Heinze concedes a foul.</p> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Two added minutes to play. Can Manchester United score? They don't often score these days.</p> <p><strong>Full time</strong> The draw specialists have done it again. A bitty game, with Sparta perhaps marginally the better side, and certainly the side who created the better chances. It doesn't really affect United's probable qualification, but nor is it the statement of intent they might have wished for ahead of Sunday's friendly with Arsenal. Thanks for all your emails, Rob.</p>",
  "<p>Home Office spending on public relations consultants and advertising increased four-fold in 2000-2004 compared with the previous four years, it was revealed today. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, said that from 1996 to 2000, the department spent a total of \u00a325,974,000 on communications - amounting to an average of 0.9% of its annual budget. </p> <p>But in 2000-2004, spending soared to \u00a3101,120,000 - or an average of 0.24% of annual expenditure. </p> <p>The highest-spending year was 2000-2001, when \u00a335.6m was spent on communications. </p> <p>Increased spending on hiring PR gurus and launching campaigns was largely due to the government's push to recruit more police officers, which has resulted in record numbers of police. </p> <p>There has also been the launch of the government's restyled drugs advice service, known as Frank, with controversial commercials deploying humour for the first time in anti-drug campaigns. </p> <p>The Home Office has also funded a chilling TV campaign on internet child grooming, which features a child's voice-over describing his favourite hobbies as the camera pans down to reveal a grown man sitting next to a computer. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The Home Office makes no apology for investing in publicity campaigns which have helped recruit a record number of police officers, alert children to the dangers of grooming on the internet and provide advice to young people on the risks of class A drugs. </p> <p>\"That spending amounts to less than 1% of the Home Office overall budget.\" </p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, accused Mr Blunkett of trying to \"spin his way out of trouble\". </p> <p>\"Crime in Britain is out of control,\" he said. \"Instead of solving the problem the home secretary is trying to spin his way out of trouble. </p> <p>\"After three years as home secretary, crime is up, asylum is a shambles and no amount of professional communication advice can hide this from the electorate.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Conservatives have a timetable for action in the fight against crime which will cut crime during the first parliament of a Conservative government.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<b>British troops in Iraq</b> <br> The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, confirmed the US had asked for British troops to provide assistance outside the UK-controlled southern sector of Iraq. But he insisted that no decision had yet been made in response. A final recommendation from the chief of defence staff was expected by the middle of the week. <p>Mr Hoon told MPs the request did not ask for troops to be deployed to Baghdad City or Falluja. He denied it was political and had anything to do with the timing of the US presidential election. \"Although it is linked to elections - it is not the US elections but with efforts to create the best possible security situation in which to hold the Iraqi elections in January.\" </p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, warned any such deployment would leave \"a big capability gap\" in the British sector and would represent \"a fundamental change\" in UK operations in Iraq. </p> <p>Robin Cook, who quit the cabinet over Iraq, said restraint shown by British troops in peacekeeping had earned them respect among the Iraqis. \"Is it really possible for them to retain that restraint if they are deployed to a US sector which has been policed for over a year by US forces which have not been showing the same level of restraint?\" </p> <p>Mr Hoon said British forces were able to adjust their approach and tactics in the light of the threat that they faced. \"They will have to be less restrained if there is a direct physical threat to them.\" </p> <p><b>Schooling shake-up</b><br> A blueprint for the biggest schooling shake-up in 60 years offers a \"cogently argued, challenging and compelling vision for the future\", the education secretary, Charles Clarke, said. He told MPs proposals by former chief inspector of schools Mike Tomlinson would provide the base on which to build a broad consensus for reform. </p> <p>Mr Clarke said the \"biggest single reform of qualifications in any of our lifetimes\" would present huge challenges and would take at least 10 years to introduce. </p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said any changes would have to be backed with \"substantial new resources\". Scrapping all existing exams would be an \"unwelcome and unnecessary diversion\" from the priority of improving \"unacceptably poor\" literacy and numeracy among school leavers. </p> <p><b>Gun culture</b><br> The home secretary David Blunkett called for concerted action to tackle \"unacceptable\" levels of gun crime as he led MPs in remembering 14-year-old shooting victim Danielle Beccan from Nottingham. He said new five-year minimum sentences for firearm possession were \"a starting point, not an end point\" in getting guns off the streets but warned pretending the situation was \"out of control\" would encourage a gun culture. </p> <p><b>Gun crime</b><br> One gun crime is committed every hour of every day in a Britain where a rising tide of firearms offences threatens to become \"an epidemic that afflicts the whole country\", the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said. He described the shooting in Nottingham as \"reminiscent of Chicago in the 1930s, not an historic English town\". </p> <p>The home secretary said that the government \"does not dispute at all\" the link between gun crime, hard drugs and criminal gangs. He said the supply and price of drugs in the UK was influenced by a wider global situation and that \"there has never been a tighter border control outside wartime than there is at the moment\". </p> <p><b>Climate change</b><br> Tories dropped plans for a debate on climate change after government statements on Iraq and exam reforms left them short of time. Tory chiefs had planned to spend half the time debating the \"rising tide\" of gun crime and the rest urging action to curb carbon dioxide emissions. But business managers pulled the second debate after the statements. </p> <p><b>Grave desecration</b><br> Mr Blunkett condemned the desecration of a grave by suspected animal rights extremists and said he believed a proposed crackdown would be successful. </p> <p>He told MPs: \"The house would want all of us to join together in condemning the bestial extremists who 10 days ago desecrated a grave in Staffordshire and to send our sympathy to the family. We have the strongest licensing laws in this area in the world. We now need the strongest action to ensure that people can go about their lawful business and can do so free from intimidation.\" </p> <p><b>Sex offenders</b><br> Labour's Huw Edwards demanded a policy u-turn on housing sex offenders at Prescoed open prison after convicted paedophile Robert Stokes absconded this month for almost 24 hours. </p> <p>Home Office minister Paul Goggins said: \"The decision to place a limited number of sex offenders who are coming towards the end of their prison sentence in Prescoed Prison was not the result of overcrowding but was part of a planned programme where suitable risk assessment is taking place.\" He would be monitoring the programme carefully. </p> <p><b>Fireworks</b><br> Loopholes in legislation to tackle misuse of fireworks could be exploited by unscrupulous traders, Labour's John Cryer warned. He said they could allow traders to \"get through\" the net and urged ministers to reconsider a universal licensing system for all firework outlets. Home Office minister Hazel Blears insisted the Fireworks Act was \"robust\" and would make a significant difference. </p> <p><b>Fake colleges</b><br> More than 250 bogus colleges have been uncovered by a Home Office crackdown on illegal immigration, it emerged. Minister Des Browne said more than a quarter of 1,050 suspect institutions inspected so far had proved to be fake and a further 250 would be subjected to more rigorous investigation. </p> <p><b>Darfur crisis</b><br> The World Health Organisation has estimated that since March between 35,000 and 70,000 displaced people have died in Darfur, Sudan from violence, disease and malnutrition, Lords leader Lady Amos said. She also told peers the UN had estimated that 1.45 million had been displaced in the region and a further 200,000 had fled to Chad. </p> <p>Lady Amos gave the figures in response to crossbencher Lord Alton, a former Liberal Democrat MP, who spoke of \"the harrowing first-hand accounts of ethnically motivated killings, rapes, burnings and lootings\" in Darfur. </p> <p><b>Supreme court plans</b><br> The government was urged to postpone its planned constitutional shake-up until the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, makes a statement about the location and cost of the planned supreme court. </p> <p>Former Law Lord Lord Lloyd urged him to spell out plans for a new home for Law Lords who are to be removed from Westminster as part of the changes. </p> <p>Junior constitutional affairs minister Lady Ashton said during the constitutional reform bill's committee stage: \"The notion that anyone would want to see the Law Lords - who are held in the highest esteem - being bundled anywhere would be an anathema to all of us.\" There was \"no question\" of the court being housed in an inappropriate building. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, and his ministers and Cabinet Office minister Douglas Alexander face the Commons at question time.

  "<p>An Indian actor who landed a high-profile role in EastEnders as the head of the soon-to-be-axed Ferreira family, will launch an appeal today against the Home Office's decision to refuse him a work permit. </p> <p>Dalip Tahil - who played Dan Ferreira - will take his case to the independent Immigration Appellate Authority in London. </p> <p>Mr Tahil - well known in his native country for his work in more than 100 \"Bollywood\" movies - faces deportation if the IAA backs the Home Office's ruling. </p> <p>The 51-year-old actor came to the UK in 2002 to perform in the hit musical Bombay Dreams, which led to his casting as head of an Indian family introduced to Albert Square in June last year. </p> <p>Actors' union Equity objected to Mr Tahil working on the BBC show, saying that his work permit had only applied to his work in Bombay Dreams, as he had specialist Indian dance skills. </p> <p>The BBC made a retrospective application to Home Office agency Work Permits UK, but was unsuccessful and was forced to drop the actor. Mr Tahil said: \"I'm hugely hurt. To be treated in this manner by the Home Office is something I find baffling. </p> <p>\"It's really come to the stage where I'm being made an example of and I've done nothing wrong. </p> <p>\"My plea to the Home Office is that the decision should be made on its merits and not on the basis that I am a well-known personality and that an example should be made of me. </p> <p>\"I've never asked for preferential treatment because I am an actor and by the same yard stick I shouldn't be dealt with harshly because I am an actor,\" he said before today's hearing.</p> <p>Mr Tahil has said he hopes to prove his immigration status was the result of inadequate advice by his former solicitor. </p> <p>Last week the BBC announced that the entire Ferreira family were to leave the troubled soap because the characters \"had run their course\". </p> <p>The family had come under fire accused of boring storylines. </p> <p>Speaking about the BBC's decision to axe the family, Mr Tahil said: \"Naturally, I'm a bit disappointed but on that level I have no grudge or animosity against that. </p> <p>\"I have been out of EastEnders for almost a year and it's a decision that has been taken by the executives of the drama department, and that is their decision. </p> <p>\"I would have liked to go back to EastEnders and perform but the decisions are taken elsewhere.\" On September 21 this year the soap had its worst viewing figures in its 19-year history, being beaten by ITV rival Emmerdale.</p> <p>The actor said before today's hearing: \"I feel I'm in the situation because it is a high-profile case and because the Home Office perhaps wants to be seen not to be doing anything special for me, they have actually tried to make an example of me with no evidence of any wrongdoing. </p> <p>\"My leave to remain in Britain has been denied to me under the highly skilled migrant programme on the grounds that I am a consistent offender but there is no evidence for that. </p> <p>\"That decision is baseless and there are no facts to substantiate their refusals.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I'm being dealt with in a manner which is very harsh. </p> <p>\"I'm not a criminal, I'm just a jobbing actor who, due to bad advice from my previous solicitors, has been put in this position.\" </p> <p>Mr Tahil has said he hopes to restore his credibility after being branded an illegal worker by some tabloid newspapers. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "The prime minister of Burma's secretive military government, General Khin Nyunt, has been removed from office by hardliners in the regime, according to reports from neighbouring Thailand. <p>\"We can confirm that Khin Nyunt has been removed from the position of prime minister and is being detained under house arrest,\" Thai government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Diplomats in Burma and other senior Thai officials claimed Gen Khin Nyunt, who is number three in the military junta, had lost a power struggle with its most powerful figure, General Than Shwe.</p> <p>Unconfirmed reports from Thailand said Gen Khin Nyunt, who is seen as a relative moderate, had been accused of corruption and place under house arrest. </p> <p>In Burma, which is a highly closed society, there were rumours that Gen Khin Nyunt had been forced to resign and that soldiers had raided the military intelligence headquarters, which were said to no longer be under his control. </p> <p>Observers said that if the reports were true, the hardliners in the junta would have a more powerful position to hamper reconciliation efforts with the pro-democracy opposition led by Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. </p> <p>Thai General Lertart Rattanatavanich told reporters in Mai Sot, a town on the border with Burma, that Thai army reports indicated that the junta \"is unhappy with Gen Khin Nyunt and they want to remove him from his position\". \"We believe that whatever has happened is about changing the position of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt,\" he said. </p> <p>The Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was holding a cabinet meeting in Mai Sot, said he had received reports that there was \"some political tension\" in Burma but could not confirm what was happening. </p> <p>There was no sign of tanks or increased military presence on the streets of the Burmese capital, Rangoon. Gen Khin Nyunt became prime minister in August last year. The role had previously been seen as a ceremonial position, and Burma observers say his appointment was probably a demotion from the positions he had previously held in the ruling clique of generals.</p> <p>Despite Gen Khin Nyunt being considered something of a moderate, he did not succeed in convincing other generals to strike a deal with Ms Suu Kyi to restore democracy to the impoverished south-east Asian country. </p> <p>Over the past year, Gen Khin Nyunt has promoted what he called a road map toward democracy in UN-brokered contacts between the government and Ms Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy. The talks were unfruitful, and critics accused the government of using stalling tactics to retain its grip on power. </p> <p>Burma has been ruled by the military since 1962, when army commander Ne Win seized power. The country was renamed Myanmar by the junta in 1989, a name recognised by the UN but not by some countries including the UK and the US, which do not recognise the military dictatorship. </p> <p>Pro-democracy protests led by Ms Suu Kyi were bloodily suppressed in 1988, and Gen Khin Nyunt was one of the younger generation of generals who assumed power.</p>",
  "<p>British history appears to have been one long series of climaxes, at least as rendered in <strong> Monarchy By David Starkey</strong> (Channel 4). Every time Starkey turned to camera and said something emphatic, it sounded like a curtain line, or at least a cue for an advert break, but it was really just a teaser for the next, even more shattering climax. This was probably true of life in the dark ages, but it made for exhausting television. </p> <p>History programmes are always looking for new ways to serve the same basic dish, and it's starting to show. Monarchy By David Starkey (is it just me, or does the title sound like a new, highbrow perfume?) is the ultra-traditional tale of kings and queens, but presents itself as a study of the concept of kingship itself. This was interesting for the first quarter of an hour, but then it settled down into the familiar sequence of events, illustrated, as ever, with liberal use of candles and dry ice. I hate myself for writing this, but if I were a commissioning editor at Channel 4, I might be tempted to say: \"Hasn't someone else done British history very recently?\" </p> <p>David Starkey is unquestionably a genius, but even he couldn't get over the feeling of deja vu, not even by making everything sound very important indeed. We strove to be interested in Offa and Edgar and Alfred and co, but there was just too much significance crammed into one hour. Starkey bit off 1,000 years of history for his first episode, and was hard pushed to give it dramatic shape. Undoubtedly the pace of future episodes will ease up, but after last night's opener I felt as if I'd been whacked round the head by one of Dr Starkey's own weighty volumes. </p> <p>ITV1's drama <strong>Tunnel of Love</strong>, on the other hand, was as light and unsatisfying as candyfloss, which wasn't inappropriate as it was set in a fairground. It was notable mainly for the appearance of Jack Dee in a dramatic role, to which he brought his trademark deadpan understatement. The story, by Simon Nye, was flimsy - although that's not to say it was disagreeable. Dee was the boss of a crummy fairground populated by likable oddballs and threatened by bad men in authority who wanted to turn it into a car park or office block. The goodies liked soul music, sex and fags, and they disliked authority, bureaucracy and wholefoods. The baddies sold drugs, committed fraud, bullied children and quite possibly pulled the legs off flies. It took 70 of the 90 minutes for any kind of plot to emerge; after that, the denouement had to happen sharpish. Dee got the girl after a lot of charming, grumpy longing. Tunnel of Love was worth the ride, though, for Cristian Solimeno (Jason from Footballers' Wives), who put in a brilliant turn as fairground lothario, and who managed to wrest from a minimal script a performance of impressive comic detail. Let's hope he graduates to leading-man status very soon, and doesn't get lumbered forever with dumb hunks (even though, as dumb hunks go, he's one of the best). </p> <p>Five felt the need to show <strong> Russ Meyer: King of Sexploitation</strong> after 11pm, probably because it contained a lot of nudity, which just goes to show how little things have really changed in tellyland. It's OK to show hospital gore at 8pm, and psychotic violence at 9, but tits and bush are strictly for wicked nightcrawlers. That's a shame, because this was a joyful celebration of a man who put humour into smut, and whose death last month robbed Hollywood of its last great unrepentant eccentric. </p> <p>The stars of Meyer's insane cinematic oeuvre were interviewed before his death, but they knew he wasn't long for this world, as former girlfriend Kitten Natividad touchingly confessed. Tura Satana (of Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!) still looks as scary as she did in her Meyer heyday; she's also preserved a gutsy sense of humour, which, let's face it, you don't get with Jennifer Aniston or Gwyneth Paltrow. There were clips of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, which would make any programme worth watching, and also rare, elusive footage of Meyer's abortive Sex Pistols project, Who Killed Bambi?, featuring Sting as a gay gangster. Meyer made millions out of such daft flicks as Vixen (an $84m return on a $24,000 budget), but it's in vain to hope that British TV producers will ever take a leaf out of his book.</p>",
  "<p>Far from the sickly-sweet smell of his home in India's northern sugar belt, sapper Arif Mohammed trudged through the snow of the Siachen Glacier, just a few months after the world had come close to a nuclear exchange on the world's highest battlefield. </p> <p>It was September 1999 and Arif, a soldier in the Indian army's 108 Engineering Regiment, had not seen much action when Indian and Pakistani troops had fought over the ice-tipped peaks and frozen wastes of the Himalayas that summer. Just married to his teenage bride, Gudiya, Arif's thoughts were of love, not war. But for the next five years, Arif would not see his wife or his village, or even the craggy ranges of Kashmir that he once patrolled. </p> <p>Inadvertently straying over the border into Pakistan, Arif was captured and held in prison for half a decade. What happened when he returned last month, to find his wife not only eight months' pregnant but married to another man, has gripped India and cast a harsh light on hitherto private affairs. </p> <p>Filling television screens and newspaper columns, the travails of the Mohammed family have been picked over and consumed by an Indian public rarely exposed to the intimacies of married life, let alone those of a poor, conservative Muslim couple. </p> <p>After Arif was detained that September, and while he stared at the bare brick walls of his small, windowless cell in Pakistan, his 16-year-old bride was pining for her missing husband. But as days became weeks and weeks became months, the thought of becoming a \"half-widow\" gnawed away at Gudiya. She began to spend more time with her mother and father. </p> <p>\"There was a decision in my family that Arif was gone,\" she says. \"I could not go on alone, so it was decided that I should remarry. I still loved Arif and remembered him and thought about him. I waited for four years.\" </p> <p>Soon Gudiya met a another man, Taufiq. \"Taufiq cared for me and I began to be slowly involved with him. I had to go on with my life and that meant slowly trying to forget Arif. You cannot have two husbands. Life is not a game.\" </p> <p>Gudiya decided to annul the marriage. This should have been a mere formality since sharia law, which has governed the life of Muslims in India since the days of the British Raj, allows for the dissolution of a union after four years. But rather than taking the case to the sharia courts, Gudiya and Arif's marriage was declared over by a village priest. This was her first mistake. While the local imam has authority over many areas, his writ does not run to dissolving the union between man and wife. </p> <p>Unbeknown to Arif, his difficulties were multiplying. Not only had his family given up on him and his wife left him for another man, but his country had abandoned him; the Indian army formally declared him a \"deserter\". </p> <p>\"I spent my days and nights thinking of going home to see my family and my wife, that is what kept me alive,\" says Arif, sitting in the courtyard of his home in the village of Mundali, 120km from Delhi. </p> <p>Arif says that he only found out about his wife's new life from his sister-in-law when he first returned across the border last month, the event captured on camera, just as the past month of his life has been. Dressed in a light blue sherwani, the traditional dress of Pakistan's Punjab province, and surrounded by the khaki uniforms of Indian officers, Arif waved, smiled and then broke down sobbing in the arms of his brother, Abdul Hamid, and sister-in-law, Sanjida. \"I was happy to be back in my country. I was alive again,\" says Arif. Soon, however, the mood changed. Gudiya was not there. Hope became dread in Arif's mind. </p> <p>\"I was worried then because I had not been able to see or speak to Gudiya. I then found out she was with a child. It was hard, yes.\" </p> <p>Arif could not come home immediately. He had to be debriefed by the Indian army, which makes the 29-year-old very cautious when talking about his \"stay\" in Pakistan. In the celebration and confusion of his eventual homecoming, the question over what to do about his marriage lay unanswered. </p> <p>There were lengthy discussions between the three families involved. Religious leaders were called in and a village council hastily convened. </p> <p>A two-hour meeting between Arif and Gudiya - the first time that they had been alone together since his return home - convinced Arif they could be happy together. \"I asked her if she loved me still. She said she could and I knew then that we could make this marriage again,\" he says. \"Gudiya had waited for four years but there was pressure from family and village to remarry.\" </p> <p>The problem was that while Arif wanted his wife back, he did not want to raise the child she is expecting. \"Gudiya told me that if I did not accept the child, she would not come back to me.\" </p> <p>To make matters worse, Taufiq, the second husband, also said that he did not want to give up his new family. </p> <p>Caught between two lifes and two loves, a heavily pregnant Gudiya at first said that she wanted to be with her second husband, then said she would go back to her first spouse, only to recant both statements. </p> <p>Because the first marriage had not been annulled, the issue still had to be decided under sharia law by Islamic judges, or ulema . Usually, this would be considered an intensely private affair, but instead it became public property, thanks to the country's burgeoning rolling news networks. </p> <p>One in particular, Zee News, took great interest in the story and created a show the like of which had never been seen on Indian television before. Gudiya, her two husbands and the village elders were persuaded to appear in a studio in the presence of Islamic scholars, to make a decision on which husband to stay with and what to do with the child. </p> <p>The programme was an immediate sensation. With questions flashing up on the screen, such as \"Whose Gudiya?\" and \"What kind of relationship?\", viewers were encouraged to ring in with questions for the guests. While this treatment may be a mainstay of British day-time television, India's billion plus population has rarely been exposed to the kind of voyeuristic thrills that shows such as Jerry Springer or Oprah have brought to the west. </p> <p>The programme lasted seven hours and moved from drama to farce. Burning with fever, Gudiya spoke from beneath the folds of an orange duppatta to say that she was not \"above the sharia\" and that she would abide by whatever decision was arrived at. </p> <p>The mock village council, or panchayat , decided that Gudiya would return to Arif and that the child would be raised in his house for a few years. The decision, which was attributed to Gudiya but was heavily influenced by the priesthood, was unsurprisingly popular with community leaders. </p> <p>A bearded Islamic scholar, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, broke down in tears at the end of the programme saying that he, \"had not thought how important a role television can play for society\". </p> <p>Taufiq, having lost both a wife and his child, looked dumbstruck and since the programme has disappeared from public view. His father rushed out of the studio and demanded half a million rupees (\u00a36,000) in compensation. </p> <p>Arif and Gudiya, meanwhile, have gone back to his home in Mundali. While they appear reconciled, there are still issues over what will happen to the new addition to their family. Although he beams for photographs, Arif still says that the child his wife is expecting is his erstwhile rival's. He looks blank when questioned about what happens after the child is born, saying that, \"If Gudiya wants to keep the kid herself then I have no problem. The ulema said it is Taufiq's child. So it is right for it to go back to him.\" </p> <p>Sitting in a cool, dark room, Gudiya shifts uncomfortably under the weight of her belly. The 21-year-old speaks slowly and without much feeling. \"I do not know what the fate of the baby will be. Please do not ask me about its future. Who knows if it will live?\" It is hardly a vote of confidence in the new baby's future. </p> <p>When asked about such dire musings, Arif says that his wife is ill and that he will look after her. After all, he points out, he has five years' pay to collect. He has plans to build a \"double-storey home\" in the village. \"There is a lot I want to do. I want to go back to my unit and serve my country. But I will be taking my wife with me this time.\"</p>",
  "More than 20 years ago, a journalist called Oscar Reyes and his wife Gloria, an interior designer, were taken from their home in Tegucigalpa, Honduras by members of the country's armed forces as part of an operation against suspected \"subversives.\" <p>Over the following days, Oscar was suspended by handcuffs from a pulley and beaten while Gloria had electric shocks applied to her breasts and genitals before being beaten unconscious with rifle butts. </p> <p>Now the man in charge of the country's intelligence service at the time has been tracked down to Florida and faces a civil action in the American courts brought by the Reyes and relatives of other detainees who did not survive to tell the tale. </p> <p>The case is the latest in a series showing that military and intelligence chiefs whose forces were responsible for extra-judicial killings and torture can no longer escape trial by fleeing the country where the atrocities took place. </p> <p>The case is due to be heard in a court in Miami, and involves the former Honduran military intelligence chief, Colonel Juan L\u00f3pez Grijalba. </p> <p>Six people, five of them now resident in the US, allege that Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba was responsible for the torture, disappearance and killing of Honduran civilians during the 1980s. </p> <p>More than 150 people died during that period. Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba was the head of the secret police force called DNI, and Battalion 3/16, a death squad operating at the time of the incidents. </p> <p>Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba, who denies the charges, moved to the Miami area from Honduras in 1998, and is being held in a detention centre by immigration authorities. He had been found to be teaching at the School of the Americas, the military training academy in Georgia that has been accused of training Latin-American soldiers in violent interrogation techniques. He has said, through his lawyer, that he was unaware of the acts committed by his subordinates. </p> <p>As well as Oscar Reyes - who is now the director of a Spanish-language newspaper in Washington, DC - those bringing the actions include Zenaida and Hector Ricardo Vel\u00e1squez, the sister and son of Manfredo Vel\u00e1squez, a university leader abducted and \"disappeared\" by intelligence agents in 1981. Relatives of Hans Madisson, a student who was abducted and murdered at the same time, are also among the plaintiffs. </p> <p>Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba has ended up in court largely through the efforts of the Centre for Justice and Accountability (CJA), a San Francisco-based human rights organisation. The group pursues alleged perpetrators of human rights abuses who have become residents of the US. \"We were alerted to his presence in the US so we went about putting a case against him,\" said Matt Eisenbrandt of CJA. </p> <p>The organisation works with pro bono lawyers and organisations representing the 500,000 political refugees estimated to be in the US. Last month, a CJA case in California resulted in a judge ordering a resident of the city of Modesto to pay $10m (\u00a35.5m) in damages in connection with the assassination of the Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero. </p> <p>While damages are being sought in the present case, the issue of money is not paramount. \"For both the CJA and our clients the most important thing is justice, getting the case into court, not the money,\" Mr Eisenbrandt said. \"At the same time we don't view it as simply symbolic. We think it is important to pursue assets to send a message. Depriving the defendant of assets could be very important.\" </p> <p>The case against Col L\u00f3pez Grijalba alleges that he was under a duty to investigate and prevent violations of international law carried out by members of the military and security forces under his command. \"The penalty we hope to achieve with this lawsuit cannot compare to what the perpetrators did to our loved ones,\" said Zenaida Velasquez, whose brother was last seen being taken for interrogation by members of Battalion 3/16. </p> <p>Success in court, she said, would be a \"moral victory ... We are motivated by love for the ones we lost, and also by a voice of conscience that says we must do everything in our power to stop the cycle of impunity that leads to more human rights abuses.\" </p> <p>Legislation introduced into the US in 1996 gave victims of torture the right for the first time to bring such actions in the American courts. </p> <p>The CJA has been largely successful, but it has not won all its cases. In one action brought against the former Salvadoran ministers of defence Guillermo Garcia and Carlos Vides Casanova, by the families of four US churchwomen who were murdered in El Salvador in 1980, the generals convinced the jury that they did not have \"effective control\" over the subordinates who committed the murders.</p>",
  "Two child refugees, who escaped from an Australian detention centre and were refused the protection of the British government, had their appeal dismissed by the court of appeal yesterday. It ruled the Foreign Office was not in breach of the Convention of Human Rights. <p>Brothers Alamdar and Muntazar Bakhtiari, aged 15 and 14, escaped from the Woomera detention centre on June 29, 2002. </p> <p>They arrived at the British consulate in Melbourne on July 18, and requested asylum. </p> <p>They were initially given protection, but hours later - on the direction of the foreign secretary, Jack Straw - they were handed back to Australian authorities. </p> <p>The unprecedented legal action brought by the brothers, hoped to prove that Mr Straw had defied the Human Rights Act by sending them back. </p> <p>However, counsel for Mr Straw had rejected the claim arguing the British consulate was not a part of the United Kingdom territory and was therefore not subject to British law. </p> <p>Lord Phillips, Lord Justice Chadwick and Lord Slynn said they found the perceived threat to the children was not severe enough that the British officials in Melbourne could have refused to return them to Australian authorities without violating international law.</p>",

For 19 days in July and August, 300 families moved into the school's battered concrete buildings, driven from their homes by rising flood waters.</p> <p>As the Himalayan snows melted and the region's great rivers - the Brahmaputra, the Megna and the Ganges - burst their banks, the children of Velanagar were among some 10 million across the country left homeless in a deluge that killed up to 1,000 people and caused as much \u00a34bn of damage to agriculture, industry and infrastructure in one of the world's poorest countries.</p> <p>Unlike as many as 300 schools around Bangladesh - particularly those closest to major rivers - Velanagar primary's buildings survived the floods, and the near-biblical rains that followed last month. But for the 350 pupils, aged six to 10, lessons stopped as the school, raised above the worst of the water on a concrete plinth, was transformed into a temporary flood shelter, offering refuge to villagers until the waters subsided.</p> <p>The effect of such a grand-scale natural disaster on education is often barely visible to the outside world, as aid efforts and international appeals concentrate on ensuring victims are given the basic requirements of food, medical help and shelter.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, which is attempting, with some success, to improve a chronically underdeveloped education system, this year's damage has set back progress. According to an assessment made in September by charities, development agencies and donor governments responding to the flood emergency, some 23,000 state schools and colleges were affected by the disaster, though many other unregistered institutions - including madrasas, or Islamic schools - have also suffered.</p> <p>Lessons were suspended in 17,871 primary schools during the floods, and over 2,300 were used as flood shelters - common practice as the schools are frequently more robust than the flimsy shacks of woven jute or corrugated iron that make up many village homes.</p> <p>As a result, Bangladesh's schools have lost an average of 25 days' education apiece this year through flooding, according to the country's education minister, Osman Farruk. The closures compound the astonishing 80 days missed annually because school facilities are used for national examinations.</p> <p>The rising waters have left a trail of destruction, even where buildings themselves survived. James Jennings, chief of Unicef's child development and education section in Bangladesh, points to the loss of textbooks, library books and other teaching materials, together with damage to blackboards, desks and chairs, either lost to the deluge or burnt as firewood by sheltering families.</p> <p>The government has provided immediate grants worth around \u00a3250 to the worst affected primary schools, and \u00a3150 to those partially damaged, but a chair and desk alone cost \u00a310 and the cash is swiftly swallowed up.</p> <p>At Velanagar primary, some three hours north-east of the capital, Dhaka, the headmistress, Lutfur Nessa Begum, says her \u00a3150 is inadequate to repair windows, floors, a water well, chairs and tables. Sitting in her shabby office, where a ceiling fan slowly stirs the humid air and an ancient wooden gavel and block are the sole ornaments on the desk, she lists the challenges already facing the school: classes of 80 in the youngest age groups, falling to 60 over five years as children drop out to begin working; a lack of equipment; the shortage of funds to provide food for youngsters who come to school unfed and spend all day hungry.</p> <p>Earnest in her plain blue sari and large tortoiseshell glasses, Begum says her biggest problem as a head is the poverty of her children's families. \"It would be good,\" she says, \"if the families could provide tiffin [a lunch snack] for the children. Most do not eat all day.\"</p> <p>Some Bangladeshi primaries provide a meal as part of a school feeding programme, designed to help with youngsters' nutritional needs, but also to attract children to school in the first place. At Velanagar, in a region where almost a third of children do not even attend primary school, boys in particular drop out at around seven or eight, as they become capable of earning money for their families.</p> <p>\"They work in cottage industries such as block printing, or selling ice cream,\" Begum says. \"Often two boys will hire a rickshaw and carry goods, one pushing and one pulling.\"</p> <p>The Bangladeshi government, when not overwhelmed with flood emergencies - or the political violence currently flaring in the country - is making some headway in tackling the education system's myriad shortcomings, notably in driving up attendance.</p> <p>Ministers boast of remarkable progress in expanding enrolment, particularly among girls, who in 1980 made up just a quarter of school pupils and by 1995 had narrowly overtaken the number of boys in primary schools.</p> <p>At secondary level, a government stipend, or grant, for the families of girls has contributed to a similar rise in the proportion of female pupils, with positive knock-on effects including delayed marriages, lower fertility rates and better healthcare for young mothers.</p> <p>The effect of government efforts, backed by international agencies and spurred by the UN's millennium development goal of universal primary schooling for girls and boys by 2015, is 83% enrolment of girls at primary level - a leap of 30% during the 90s - and 81% of boys.</p> <p>Such impressive progress could stall, however, unless Bangladesh can sort out the fundamental problem still dogging its school system: the inadequate quality of the education provided. The difficulty is partly one of resources. At a primary school in a woven jute hut in the village of Dakshin Bejora, in the Sylhet region of north-east Bangladesh, youngsters sit on the beaten earth floor, each equipped with no more than a small slate and pencil, and a pot containing crayons, a brush to clean the slate, a ruler and a set of counting sticks. Visited by the Labour MP Oona King, assessing the impact of the floods on behalf of her many Bangladeshi constituents in her Bethnal Green and Bow seat, the children jump up to perform folk songs and dances, jangling ankle bells and wearing red and orange ribbons in their hair.</p> <p>Later in the visit, however, the ribbons are gone, though the class's two 15-year-old teachers insist the slates are not merely for show.</p> <p>James Jennings, of Unicef, says the lack of equipment and adequate buildings is compounded by poorly trained teachers. \"The approach is very didactic, and the main focus is memorising, with little analytical thinking. The teacher is proud if the children can 'read' the whole textbook without looking at it.\"</p> <p>With class sizes rising as high as 80 or 90 at the younger end, the possibility of any of the \"personalised learning\" beloved by UK education ministers, is remote.</p> <p>The effects of poor teaching quality are predictable: drop-out rates are a whopping 37% for girls and 38% for boys, and achievement is low - only just over a quarter of girls complete primary education at the minimum expected standard. A mere 8% of girls successfully complete the secondary education cycle, with most of the rest married by 18.</p> <p>At secondary level, Bangladesh is also struggling with exam corruption, with pupils paying others to sit papers for them, or paying bribes to secure answer sheets or good grades.</p> <p>Farruk, the education minister, lists three priorities for education. Improving quality is crucial, and efforts are under way to step up teacher training, and to offer some in-service support to existing staff. The government is particularly keen to see madrasas, some of which are partly state-funded, widen their largely Islamic curriculum to include more mainstream subjects, including English and IT, though some, particularly those outside the state system, are certain to resist.</p> <p>More and better teaching of English in all schools is another priority if Bangladesh is to have a hope of strengthening international trade links and attracting investment.</p> <p>The third fundamental focus is infrastructure, ranging from upgrading the corrugated iron shacks that often serve as schoolrooms to establishing broadband internet access throughout the country. Here, we are back to the floods. Though this year's were exceptionally severe, Bangladesh suffers some flooding annually, and must endure more if climate change continues.</p> <p>Development agencies and donors, including the British Department for International Development - the first and most generous giver in the wake of the summer floods - want the Bangladeshi government to build new schools designed to double as flood shelters, an approach backed by King as she lobbies ministers for more support for Bangladesh.</p> <p>\"Given that the country faces frequent floods, it's critical that the Bangladeshi government looks at prevention methods to reduce the impact,\" King says. The proposed school buildings would be bigger than the typical village primaries, but would stand on stilts or platforms to survive the waters.</p> <p>Such plans, however, rest on both cash and the abilities of a very mixed bag of politicians operating in a country where corruption is endemic, poverty is extreme and forward planning is never first priority.</p> <p>With political strikes and terrorism currently rocking the country, few would bet on improvements soon, though the lines of small girls in blue uniforms who now head daily to school across Bangladesh are testament that progress is possible.</p>",

  "<p>These are exciting times to be doing physics research - but a good deal too exciting for the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (Pparc), the body that has to fund it.</p> <p>Quite apart from the Large Hadron Collider being built deep beneath the Franco-Swiss border, at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern) near Geneva, there is a wave of big projects taking the physics community by storm - a series of European missions to Mars, a gigantic optical telescope to observe earth-like planets orbiting faraway stars, a square kilometre array of radio telescopes to probe deep space and a 30km particle smasher.</p> <p>Researchers in this country are hoping to get a piece of the action when preparatory research and development programmes for these projects get under way in the next decade.</p> <p>But with financial uncertainties stalling the UK's main funder of particle physics and astronomy, it remains unclear whether the UK can afford its researchers to take part in all of them.</p> <p>Normally, the UK research councils would find out their three-year budgets in December, following a spending review such as the one this summer. But this year, a new performance management system will delay the budget announcements for the 2005-08 period until Easter next year.</p> <p>The timing could not be worse for Pparc, which needs to know its future budget sooner rather than later, to make urgent, long-term planning decisions. Already, it has had to make a funding commitment for the preparatory phase of Aurora, the European Space Agency's (ESA) project for exploration of Mars, without knowing whether it will be able to fund the programme proper.</p> <p>The \u00a35m commitment will make the UK a \"leading contributor\" to Aurora, Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, said at the announcement on October 1. Of that sum, \u00a33.5m will be signed away to ESA as a blank cheque towards the preparatory phase. The remaining \u00a31.5m will be spent on research and development activities in the UK.</p> <p>The decision to put money into Aurora at this preparatory stage indicates a positive feeling in Pparc about the ability to find in its future budget the \u00a325m a year that full Aurora membership will require. \"It is implicit if you do R&amp;D in an area that you will put the necessary money on the table [to build it],\" said Professor Ian Halliday, Pparc's chief executive.</p> <p>But the future of the UK in Aurora still depends on a favourable budget settlement this spring. \"It's a good start for the R&amp;D preparation,\" said Professor Martin Ward, chair of Pparc's science committee. \"But it is far short of what will be needed in the long term.\"</p> <p>Aurora is the first of the next generation of big physics projects to reach the stage where firm funding commitments are necessary. But the other three will not be far behind. UK astronomers have already submitted a bid to Pparc, asking it to match European groundwork funding for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) of radio telescopes, requesting \u00a36m over four years.</p> <p>\"We believe that the science case is so strong that Pparc will support it,\" said Professor Andrew Lyne, astronomer at Jodrell Bank Observatory at the University of Manchester, which is leading the UK contingent on SKA. He does not even want to contemplate a scenario where Pparc refuses its bid. \"We really just have to approach these things optimistically,\" he said.</p> <p>In the long term, researchers hope the UK will shoulder 10% of the total SKA project cost, estimated at several hundred million euros. \"If we put in less than 5%, that will put us really in second rank among the countries involved,\" said Phil Diamond, leader of the UK contingent and chair of the SKA international steering committee.</p> <p>The main construction phase for the SKA behemoth is expected to stretch between 2010 and 2020. The top runners for hosting it are South Africa, Western Australia, Brazil, Argentina and the US, and a decision is expected in early 2006.</p> <p>But this timescale could coincide with the construction of the next generation of optical telescopes, which will require preparatory funding on a similar scale to that for SKA. These \"overwhelmingly\" large telescopes would use collectors up to 100 metres in diameter to investigate heavenly bodies that cannot be seen using existing telescopes.</p> <p>The UK has several options to go with, depending on which countries it wants to collaborate with. For example, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is looking into building a 100-metre telescope, operational by 2020.</p> <p>There are other potential partners, such as the US. According to Ward, Pparc will have to decide on what partner to go with, and the budget implications it will have, very soon.</p> <p>But the list does not end there. The international particle physics community is sketching out a Linear Collider (LC) to succeed the Large Hadron Collider being built at Cern. The LC will aim to provide answers to many questions about the nature of dark energy, extra dimensions and the fundamental nature of space and time.</p> <p>Recently, it was decided that the LC should use low-temperature technologies, which puts the project well in line with UK expertise. Already Pparc has awarded \u00a310m to national accelerator science projects this year to ensure the UK can play a lead role. But, as with the other projects, more money will be needed. \"Within the present science budget we can't possibly be major participants in them all,\" Ward said.</p> <p>Pparc's annual budget is \u00a3300m at the moment, and half of that is earmarked for subscriptions to organisations like the ESO. The remaining \u00a3150m needs to cater to all the funding needs of UK particle physicists and astronomers. The Aurora subscription alone would eat up one sixth of this funding.</p> <p>One way of taking the pressure off funding agencies is to make sure the cost profiles of large international projects do not peak simultaneously. \"These things are all global, so we are all in the same boat in terms of looking at the spending profiles,\" Ward said.</p> <p>The need for a global road map for large-scale projects in astronomy and astrophysics was brought up at two OECD workshops earlier this year. But such a road map is not likely to appear for some time. In the meantime, Pparc will have to hope that the timescales of projects will serendipitously match up, to minimise pressures on its budget, and that its budget settlement next year will contain some good news.</p> <p>While awaiting the new budget, Pparc's science committee is trying to keep the options open so the UK will be able to join all four projects if the funding is there in the future.</p> <p>\"Solving the key problems in particle physics and astronomy is like doing a jigsaw, the pictures on some pieces are more interesting than on others,\" Ward said. \"There are strong arguments for a country with the world's fourth largest economy being at the forefront in several of these global endeavours that will shape our view of the universe and our place in it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Linda Nordling is a reporter on Research Fortnight</p>",
  "Was this the tipping point at which the once loyal Labour party finally decided it had had enough over Iraq? Will all those MPs who trooped nervily into the \"aye\" lobby in March last year, and who have cheered Tony Blair to the roofbeams, even after it turned out that the dodgy dossier was full of dross, finally turn in rage upon their front bench? <p>I wouldn't bet on it; they are far too keen to save their seats, and you don't do that by crying: \"Vote Labour: they'll lie their heads off!\" But we got closer to it yesterday than before. </p> <p>The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, came under sustained fire, far more than he has in the past. He coped as he always does, by acting as if it wasn't happening. </p> <p>(He would have been deeply reassuring during the first world war. \"Sir, sir, it looks like the Boche are coming at us, sir!\" </p> <p>\"No need to be alarmed, Hoskisson. I expect they just want another game of football.\") </p> <p>He reminded me of the head of the planning committee on a small provincial town council, being criticised about the siting of a new bus shelter. </p> <p>His tone was calm, even on occasion slightly testy, but basically implied that none of it really mattered too much. It was, after all, only a bus shelter - or at least the deployment of a few hundred troops. Why was everyone so het up about it? </p> <p>He told the Commons that, if the Americans ask for support, the Black Watch might be moved north, instead of going home to Scotland, as they had been told. </p> <p>He insisted that no decision to do this had been made. He implied that it was an open question. </p> <p>Yeah, right. But he gave the game away when Jenny Tonge, a Liberal Democrat, asked: \"If we refuse the American request, what penalties are we likely to incur?\" </p> <p>Mr Hoon replied: \"There will be no penalty, but we will have failed in our duty as an ally and as a country that has closely supported the United States.\" </p> <p>This admission - we will make a decision later with an open mind, but only a craven cur would decide the wrong way - caused the Commons to erupt in mock astonishment and genuine anger, so much so that the Speaker had to calm everyone down, an unusual event when the council discusses new bus shelters - sorry, discusses the movement of British troops to one of the most dangerous places on the planet. </p> <p>It was with almost lip-curling contempt that moments later the anti-war MP Alan Simpson quoted at Mr Hoon the song from Oklahoma: \"I'm just a girl who can't say no.\" </p> <p>I think that even Geoff Hoon must have been worried by the political weight of those who assailed him. Robin Cook (why should our troops suffer because of the Americans' trigger happy rules of engagement?) and Ken Clarke (for goodness sake, don't make them slaughter more civilians - I paraphrase in both cases) are old anti-war warhorses. </p> <p>But Gerald Kaufman was not happy either, seeing our lads being sent into battle to save George Bush's backside next month. Andrew MacKinlay, a Labour MP who voted for the war, pointed out that not a single Labour member had supported the American request. \"I beg you not to stretch the envelope too far, or else it might burst,\" he said, deploying a metaphor which made up in passion for what it lacked in elegance. </p> <p>Mr Hoon calmly finished, in the manner of one who has promised to refer the matter of the bus shelter to the planning sub-committee (bus shelters), and will report back to the council within the next few weeks.</p>"
