  "They walk in slow procession across a field of summer flowers, through the scent of mint into the nightmare of their memories. They arrive this time as survivors, not prisoners. Or else they come to pay homage to dead relatives at this accursed place: the now disused iron ore mine at Omarska, in northwest Bosnia. In 1992 it was a concentration camp, the location of an orgy of killing, mutilation, beating and rape, prior to enforced deportation for those lucky enough to survive. The victims were Bosnian Muslims and some Croats, the perpetrators their Serbian neighbours. <p>They move, tentatively, on this day of commemoration among desolate, rust-coloured industrial buildings, haunted by what happened within them. Nusreta Sivac places a flower on each space of floor where her dead friends once slept in the quarters for women who \"served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, covered with blood\" - quarters just across a hallway from the now empty office where she was, like them, serially raped, night after night. And she passes the window from which she watched the slaughter of men on the asphalt below, day in, day out. </p> <p>Satko Mujagic knows that asphalt well: his two-year-old daughter now plays with a ball on the very spot where he had been too weak to line up for bread because of dysentery, and had to be supported by his father. Later, the child picks a daisy. \"You do this where your father lay bleeding,\" says one of the party. \"Being here gives me the feeling of understanding nothing,\" says Satko. \"The violence here was nothing to do with anything, not even war. It is unfathomable.\" </p> <p>Young Sehiba Jakupovic, her face contorted with grief, stares around the rooms in a building called the White House from which hardly anyone emerged alive; her husband Alem was among those who perished. \"I have a 12-year-old now,\" she says quietly, \"just a baby at the time.\" </p> <p>Nusreta tells the story of a family typical of Omarska and its legacy; one family among the thousands. \"It was the night of one of their saints, St Peter,\" she recalls. \"The guards were drunk and set tyres on fire, singing their songs and screaming as they took prisoners out to jump on them and beat them to death. One man, Becir Medunjanin, was being jumped upon, while his wife Sadeta watched from our quarters. She cried out, 'What are they doing to him?' and I tried to calm her lest she lost control and was taken out too. Sadeta was later killed as well. They had two sons; one had already been killed when they shelled the village - Sadeta always said that if she survived Omarska she would find his body to give it a proper burial. The other, Anes, survived Omarska, the only member of the family to live. He came with me just recently to identify Sadeta's body and gave his DNA. 'That is my mother,' he said.\" </p> <p>The date of this commemoration of the camp's closure - August 6 - is branded into these people's minds. And I have a stake in all this: for the closure of Omarska followed the day after the putrid afternoon of August 5, 1992, on which it had been my accursed honour to find a way into this place, along with a crew from ITN. </p> <p>We saw little that day, but enough: terrified men emerging from a hangar, in various states of decay - some skeletal, heads shaven - and drilled across a asphalt yard, under the watchful eye of a machine-gun post, into a canteen where they wolfed down watery bean stew like famished dogs, skin folded like parchment over their bones. \"I do not want to tell any lies,\" said one prisoner, \"but I cannot tell the truth.\" And it is strange - traumatic, indeed - to stand again in that now empty canteen; strange to walk that asphalt killing ground. </p> <p>It is disturbing to wander these dread buildings - where inmates were held and beaten, and whence they were called to their death: buildings forbidden to us that day in 1992, our paths blocked by armed guards and the camp commander, Zjelko Meakic, now awaiting trial in The Hague. Disturbing also to see the so-called Red House, where prisoners' throats were cut. </p> <p>The feeling is all the more strange when I recognise a man I had met that day, in that same canteen: Sefer Haskic, who is now a joiner in Bolton, revisits the room into which he was crammed. \"I was trying to remember the people they killed,\" he says. \"All my friends. They would call out the names, and men would get up, leave us, and never come back. You could hear the screaming, the killing, you could smell burning tyres and dead bodies. Next morning there would usually be about 30 of them: the yellow truck would arrive so that other prisoners could load them up and go to dig graves. The truck would always come back, but the men who loaded it usually not. I was forever waiting my turn, but it never came - I still can't believe I'm alive.\" Sefer remembers in particular a night of frenzied ferocity, during which some 150 men were killed, \"and the walls were covered with blood\". </p> <p>However, these people have not returned to Omarska only for remembrance; it is also a gesture of defiance. It was intended by the Bosnian Serbs - as has been affirmed at The Hague - that no Muslims (or rather Bosniaks - the secular ethnic term by which they are properly known) should remain on this territory alive; that they should all be deported or killed. But all around us now are the sights and sounds of a once unthinkable return by thousands of Bosniaks to the homes from which they were brutally expelled. They come back under the shadow and insignia of their persecutors, with whom they live cheek by jowl - for this is the so-called Republika Srpska granted to the Bosnian Serbs at Dayton in 1995. But they do so all the same. </p> <p>They return also to the village of Kozarac, the site of a savage attack on May 24, 1992. It was emptied of all 25,000 Bosniak inhabitants. Every Muslim house was marked in paint for incineration; the surviving Muslims herded in droves over the mountains at gunpoint. But the place is now home to more than 6,000 Bosniak \"returnees\", who outnumber the Serbs as they did before, with an additional 15,000 visiting from the scattered diaspora for summer. Once again, minarets - blown apart by the Serbs - nestle, rebuilt, against the hillside. </p> <p>With much greater difficulty, people return also to the local seat of authority, Prijedor, where the persecutions were planned and whence orders for establishment of the camps, for the killing and mass deportation were given. In Prijedor returnees live under the cold stare of their erstwhile persecutors, but Kozarac is an effervescent, if peculiar, place. As families sit out to enjoy pizza and beer in the warm evening, so they recognise one another: a survivor of Omarska here, of another camp there, a bereaved father here, a widowed mother there. The entire community is a concentration camp survivors' reunion. Everyone here is damaged, but resilient. No life is unaffected by the maelstrom of violence. </p> <p>If there is a driving force behind the return to Kozarac, it is the quietly composed figure of Sabahudin Garibovic, who runs the Concentration Camp Survivors' Association. \"We are doing this,\" he says, \"to show the Serbs who evicted us that they did not entirely succeed. That we can come back. They never thought they would see it. They cannot fathom what we are doing.\" </p> <p>Sabahudin's father survived Omarska, but his brother Armin was among the first to die there, his name called from among 156 men packed into the \"garage\", a space just five metres by six. There was no water: the men had to drink urine to live. It was so hot that the prisoners smashed an upper window to let in air, for which Armin and another man were murdered. Sabahudin himself is a survivor of Trnopolje, another camp we entered that day in 1992: \"I remember them taking out the girls to do what they would with them - six or so each night, including my niece.\" Trnopolje was the location for the enduring image of the war: the skeletal Fikret Alic and other prisoners behind barbed wire. </p> <p>\"Almost every day I see the people who did this to us,\" says Sabahudin. \"We live separate lives - there is nothing that unifies us with the Serbs. We rely on ourselves and each other to survive.\" </p> <p>Just before our meeting, a jubilant wedding motorcade passed through town, hooting and waving the old Bosnian wartime flag. In overwhelmingly Serbian Prijedor, it was pelted with bottles and rocks. Two weeks before, a bomb had been thrown at a Bosniak-owned bar in Kozarac; a Serbian former camp guard living near Omarska was beaten up by Bosniaks. There are countless such incidents. \"International foundations organise round tables to discuss living together,\" says Sabahudin, \"but it is empty talk, and the reasons are simple: we cannot forgive or forget what happened, and they either deny it happened or say they had to do it - they were obeying orders.\" </p> <p>Kozarac's economy depends almost entirely on the diaspora - on Omarska survivors such as Edin Kararic, who now works as a tanker driver based in Watford, near London. Edin has managed to put some money into buying a cafe called Mustang on Kozarac's main drag, managed for him by a fellow survivor. \"They drove us out,\" says Edin, \"and we are buying it back. This cafe is my finger stuck up to the Serbs who did not want us here. In fact, that is what those minarets are, on the mosques that no one goes to: fingers stuck up at the Serbs. That is why we must come back to this place - why else would any of us want to, given what happened here? </p> <p>\"Mind you,\" he adds, pensively, \"it's difficult to enjoy yourself in a place where 7,000 people are missing from a population of 25,000.\" </p> <p>Emsuda Mujagic was among the first to come back to Kozarac, having been a refugee in Croatia. \"I wanted to see in the new millennium at home,\" she says, \"and so I came back on December 31 1999. Our house was one of the first to be destroyed in the shelling, but we rebuilt it slowly. There was literally nothing here. No birds, just snakes and a few Chetniks [slang for Serbs]. I have to stand up to their plan, which was to destroy not just a community but a whole people. That is the wish that has kept me going.\" </p> <p>Emsuda is a survivor of Trnopolje, and on the 12th anniversary of our discovery of the camp, she takes me back to what is now a school again, closed for summer. There, sitting on the steps, Esmuda recalls how each night \"the guards would just walk by and shoot or beat people while we slept in the open. Or else they would come into the women's and children's quarters with torches and read the names of young girls from a list, some as young as 10, 12 or 13. They would take them to a house where Serbian soldiers from the front would have their way with them. Some of the girls would come back, scarred and tortured - others would not, and we understood they had been tortured to death. One woman was breastfeeding her baby when they took her - she gave the child for safekeeping and came back horribly scarred.\" </p> <p>Nusreta, who struggled to come to terms with her ordeal in Omarska, steeled herself to return to Prijedor in July 2002. By way of welcome, she found the word \"Omarska\" scrawled across her doorway by her new neighbours. \"At first I thought I wouldn't be able to bear it,\" she says. \"I used to stay indoors, peeping through the curtains.\" </p> <p>There was always a macabre intimacy to Bosnia's war - people knew their torturers and murderers - and the intimacy remains. \"A lot of the Omarska guards live in my neighbourhood,\" says Nusreta. \"I see them almost every day. One of them, called Vokic, has his entrance in the next block of flats and we share a bedroom wall. I see the interrogators and even the man who ordered that I be put in Omarska - he's a bank manager and drives a Mercedes. I try to catch his eye, but he turns away. Another has been let out from prison in The Hague - called Kvocka. Last time I looked him in the eye was when he was in the dock and I was a witness. But I often see him on the street, even on the day we went to buy flowers for the burials of five women from Omarska whose bodies had been exhumed. There he was, in the florist buying flowers for his wife. I said to my friend: 'Look, Kvocka is standing behind you. On the day the dead are buried, and thousands more are dead, he walks free.'\" </p> <p>Nusreta, a former judge, returned not to her own apartment but to her brother's. Why? When she emerged alive from Omarska, she explains, she found a former typist from the bench called Ankica living in her flat, and was invited in for coffee. \"There I was, like someone gone mad,\" recalls Nusreta, \"straight from Omarska and a guest in my own flat. I sat down on my sofa. Ankica, wearing my clothes, made me coffee in my pot, served in the china my mother left me, and asked me: 'Why are you acting so strange?' She said the apartment suited her, she had always wanted one like this.\" </p> <p>Years later, Nusreta returned - as was her right under the Dayton peace plan - to be promised by Ankica that everything would be left in order. \"But when I finally evicted her,\" says Nusreta, \"it had all gone. Even the built-in wardrobe. Everything I had inherited from my mother. Even my photographs. It was pure spite, to wipe out my past.\" Thankfully, Nusreta has a few good friends in Prijedor, notably the only Bosniak doctor in town, Azra, whose elderly father and stepmother had their throats cut when after surviving Omarska in 1992. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I get a crisis in the night,\" says Nusreta, \"that someone may knock at the door or throw a brick through my window. But I will become happier in accordance with how many of our people come back. My only wish is that, by us coming home, the Serbs do not get what they wanted.\" However, she says by way of conclusion, \"I can never again be happy.\" </p> <p>One hallmark of the aftermath of Bosnia's war is an almost complete lack of reckoning on the part of the Bosnian Serbs. Only one defendant - the former Bosnian Serb joint-president herself, Biljana Plavsic - has pleaded guilty at The Hague to what happened, and appealed for reconciliation. But around Omarska the returnees' narrative falls down a black hole in the perpetrators' memory. \"There was no camp here,\" security guards at the entrance to Omarska mine told us. \"It was all lies, Muslim lies, and forgery by the journalists.\" </p> <p>\"There is no remorse,\" says Nusreta. \"No one has apologised or even admitted what happened. They say they know nothing about the camps. There are 145 mass graves and hundreds of individual graves in this region, and we invite the local authorities to our commemorations, but they never come.\" \"Even now,\" says the Bosniak political leader in Prijedor, Muharem Murselovic, \"the Serbs will not accept that anything happened. I am always in a dilemma - are they crazy, or are they pretending to be crazy? I think it is because they were all so deeply involved in what was happening that they cannot come forward and admit it.\" </p> <p>\"Every time I see a Serb who is extremist,\" says Sabahudin, \"I remind him of what happened in front of their eyes. In such a way as I hope might change his viewpoint. He has to understand that, if this country is to survive, they have to change their mind. Any future together is conditional upon them admitting what they did, and apologising for it.\" </p> <p>The security guards from the all-Serbian village of Omarska signal that it is time for the commemorative procession to leave the camp. But as we leave, there remains one urgent question, one burning uncertainty. </p> <p>Crucial to the reckoning of which Sabahudin speaks is the future of the site of camp Omarska. There is nothing to mark what happened here - the horrors are officially buried, hidden, denied. The Serbian local authorities are enthusiastically pursuing a plan to sell off the mine to overseas investors, which could result in the concealment of a mass grave, a monument to barbarity. The killing ground could become a car park. The physical memory of this evil but sacred ground could be obliterated. </p> <p>Bosniak expectations are modest, and quite possibly doomed. \"We would be pleased,\" says Sabahudin, \"if there could just be some kind of memorial, maybe that the White House might be fenced off. We just want something to ensure that the memory is preserved, and in the smallest way to awaken the conscience of the Serbs. That is the really important thing. Because if we don't awaken that conscience, we might as well forget everything. And that would be the saddest thing of all - to forget what happened and what could happen again tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow.\"</p>",
  "A court in Zimbabwe today sentenced British mercenary Simon Mann to seven years in prison for attempting to buy arms to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea. <p>The court also handed down 16-month sentences to the two pilots of a plane that landed in Zimbabwe in March carrying dozens of suspected mercenaries. The 65 men who were on the plane were convicted of immigration offences and given 12-month sentences.</p> <p>Mann, a former SAS officer and co-founder of security group Executive Outcomes, admitted trying to buy assault rifles, grenades, anti-tank rocket launchers and other weapons from Zimbabwe Defence Industries. He and the 65 mercenaries were arrested at Harare international airport on March 7 as they awaited delivery of the weapons.</p> <p>Prosecutors said the arms were destined for Equatorial Guinea where Mann, 51, and his co-accused intended to take part in a coup to overthrow the president, Teodoro Obiang. At a court hearing last month Mann was acquitted of an additional charge of taking possession of the weapons.</p> <p>Mann claimed the weapons were destined to protect a mining operation in war-torn eastern Congo.</p> <p>\"I am devastated. I can't believe it. They have already done six months and with this sentence it is now 18 months,\" Marge Pain, whose husband was a passenger on the plane, told the Reuters news agency. Relatives of the men broke down and wept as the ruling was handed down.</p> <p>One of Mann's former associates at Executive Outcomes, Nick du Toit, is currently on trial for his life in Equatorial Guinea for his part in the alleged plot. Sir Mark Thatcher, son of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, has been charged in South Africa with helping to fund the plot via a payment to a third party. He has been subpoenaed to answer questions on September 22. Sir Mark denies any involvement or knowledge of the coup.</p> <p>A total of 88 people are in custody in South Africa, Equatorial Guinea and Zimbabwe in connection with the plot.</p> <p>Equatorial Guinea wants to question a number of other Britons over allegations they financed the coup plot in Africa's third-largest oil producing nation. The Guardian today reported that a so-called \"wonga list\" of alleged millionaire backers of the aborted coup is said to have been handed over to South African police by two of Mann's former colleagues. </p> <p>According to the list, seen by the Guardian, Mann paid $500,000 (\u00a3281,000) towards the coup. Ely Calil, a London-based Lebanese oil millionaire, is alleged to have raised another $750,000. Mr Calil's lawyer has denied that his client had any knowledge of the plot.</p>",
  "<p>This may not be the most subtle form of political theatre. But Embedded, written and directed by Tim Robbins and performed by The Actors' Gang from Los Angeles, is a lively addition to the body of protest drama about the Iraq war: closer in spirit to The Madness of George Dubya than to the Tricycle's sober verbatim theatre. </p> <p>There are three strands to Robbins's satirical collage. The most potent concerns the US military's attempt to control information from the embedded mainstream media. Then there are the political debates amongst the masked neo-cons in Bush's war cabinet. </p> <p>And, finally, there is the testimony of soldiers who express bewildered dismay and even, as in the famous case of the captive female rescued from an Iraqi hospital, find their experience grotesquely fictionalised. </p> <p>Robbins's weakness is that, in 85 minutes, he takes on too much and embraces too many diverse styles: everything from the techniques of Piscator's 1920s political revues to the homely realism of soldiers' letters. He sometimes takes too much on trust. </p> <p>The ideologically pure neo-cons prostrate themselves before the iconic figure of the German refugee philosopher, Leo Strauss. But I learned more about Strauss, who endorsed Plato's \"noble lies\", from the New York Review of Books than from the show. </p> <p>But to those who argue the show is leftwing propaganda, I would suggest that is nothing compared to the propaganda of the American military machine. </p> <p>Robbins is at his best in showing the journalists being drilled by a showbiz-addicted sergeant and in reminding us of the limitations placed on truth: on-the-spot reporters have to seek \"script approval\" back home, access to casualties is denied, events like the toppling of Saddam's statue are choreographed. His key point is that American viewers and readers have been fed a sanitised vision of the war. </p> <p>It also seems pointless to insist that all political theatre must be identical: there is room for wild satire as well as drama-doc. </p> <p>And when Robbins shows the cartoonish neo-cons offering contradictory justifications for war and gleefully asking \"Where do we go next?\" he is offering justified elaborations of known truths. </p> <p>Back home his buoyant show was critically panned and publicly popular; and the reason, I suspect, is that it offers a disenchanted view that doesn't get much airing in the predominantly pliant media. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until October 23.

  "<p>\"I take serious offence to the RNC being in my fuckin' city; it's really pissing me off. It's the same scumbags who don't live anywhere near you, but are still going to organize a force to stop you from having an abortion - because they care about you. The same people want to feel our pain over 9/11, but they don't realize that we're in a completely different place. The people who actually experienced it have no connection to these people coming in. They didn't experience it, they don't understand what we feel, and they don't understand us. It's just manipulation.\" - Brooklyn, NY, rapper El-P </p> <p>Art Spiegelman's works, especially the groundbreaking Holocaust comic Maus, have always been as much about phenomena occurring outside his vertiginous comic strip frames as it has been about the events within them. This is because the world around the famed comix lifer has always seemed on the verge of annihilation - as he confesses more than once in his sprawling, sharply satirical In the Shadow of No Towers, a collection of strips built by Spiegelman over the last three years and finally published by Pantheon Books just before the third anniversary of 9/11. </p> <p>In his foreword to No Towers, Spiegelman writes that the book's gorgeous \"single-page units,\" printed on 42 pages of heavy card stock and designed to resemble the Sunday newspaper comics panels of a bygone era, \"corresponded to my existential conviction that I might not live long enough to see them published.\" His parents' ordeal in Auschwitz at the hands of the Nazis, he goes on, taught him to \"always keep [his] bags packed.\" Spiegelman freely admits that the psychic terrors of 9/11 corresponded to a deep-seated \"self-inflicted\" trauma, a fervent belief that Armageddon - both the religious conflict and the Bruce Willis movie - was, as the Rolling Stones sang in Gimme Shelter, \"just a shot away\". </p> <p>This kind of unrelenting dread has kept artists of all kinds in full sublimation mode since the invention of the cave drawing, and has provided human culture with no shortage of standout works. But this latent fear has also invigorated the capitalist schadenfreude of everyone from Fox News to Manhattan street merchants to the Bush administration, not to mention the supposedly liberal New York publications that avoided Spiegelman's post-9/11 rants like they were undocumented Arab immigrants. And Spiegelman, always the astute cultural critic, knows this better than anyone. </p> <p>Indeed, his July-August 2003 installment of the No Towers series dedicates itself to the profit others have reaped off the backs of citizens thrown into chaos by a national tragedy. In one of two vertical strips (as with everything Spiegelman, the arrangement and construction of his comics deviate from standard convention whenever possible), one of the artist's doppelgangers holds up a garish tourist trap clock emblazoned with the twin towers, a looming American eagle, FDNY figurines and a United States flag, confessing that he was an eyewitness and even a participant in \"the bombardment of kitsch\" that hit the US after 9/11 like an X-rated Xtina video on Kazaa. </p> <p>In the second strip, the same clock blows up like a bomb in Spiegelman's face, as cowboy boots branded with dollar signs fall from the sky on a fleeing populace filled with cartoon legends like Annie, Wimpy, Hapless Hooligan (who repeatedly serves, as do the meek mice from Maus, as a Spiegelman alter ego), Charlie Brown and many more. Even this summer's Republican National Convention - the capitalization on misfortune to end all capitalizations on misfortune - is identified by the author as an example of tragedy \"transformed into travesty\". This must-have collection of hard-hitting, self-deprecating strips on life during wartime was ignored during its creation by the very publications that made Spiegelman a big name in New York literary and artistic circles: the New York Times, the New York Review of Books and the New Yorker (which has both commissioned Spiegelman for cover art and employed his wife, Francoise Mouly, as an art editor). As he admits in the foreword, \"Outside of the left-leaning alternative press, mainstream publications that have actively solicited work from me ... fled when I offered these pages or excerpts from the series.\" In fact, the only mainstream homes for his controversial work were found in the countries - Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands - that were lambasted by Donald Rumsfeld and George W Bush as \"old Europe\" and derided by the American media. </p> <p>In a sense, this neglect helped push the work further. \"The feelings of dislocation reflected in these No Towers pages,\" Spiegelman writes, \"arose in part from the lack of outcry against the outrages [of the Bush administration] while they were being committed\". Now, in the most heated political season of recent generations, those who once spurned Spiegelman's work have recovered their cojones, and No Towers is something of a hot commodity. </p> <p>New Yorkers like rapper El-P, quoted above, are justifiably sick and tired of facile 9/11 sympathies that turn out to be marketing gimmicks. But no one's going to accuse Spiegelman of cashing in on the tragedy's third anniversary, and not just because he is a New York lifer who has consistently raged against the machines of oppression and manipulation since his days editing the seminal 80s graphic mag Raw. The Pantheon press kit is now packed with fawning headlines from the publications that showed him the door two years ago, but Spiegelman can only control what ends up on the spectacular colored pages that set In the Shadow of No Towers apart from every other 9/11 interrogation. </p> <p>As Spiegelman notes in No Towers while fleeing the crumbling World Trade Center and encountering a giant billboard for Arnold Schwarzenegger's fireman-revenge drama Collateral Damage, irony is not dead. Neither is the idea that art can sometimes transcend the pleasure, pain and callous commerce of the world that generates it. Spiegelman's highly personal exploration of the horrors of 9/11 and how they nearly destroyed him (even as they were being perverted by the \"Architects of Armageddon,\" as he calls Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld, into a blank check for imperial aggression) offers a more powerful criticism of postmodern America's state of affairs than most of those found in this season's Bush-bashing titles. Even better, this lavishly produced, eye-popping collection costs only $20 - a bargain for a work of comics art this sophisticated (and likely to become a collector's item). </p> <p>If anything, the fact that the American intelligentsia finally seems ready to admit that Spiegelman was speaking truth to power in the dark years of 2002 and 2003 ought to make us sleep a little better at night - at least until, as Spiegelman explains in No Towers, the sky starts falling again and the duct tape market catches fire.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Scott Thill is the editor of Morphizm.com and the author of Salon's \"Writing in the Margins\" column.

  "<p>British scientists have spotted a new moon around Saturn. It brings the count of Saturn's moons to 34. They may even have discovered a second one. And they may also have spotted a new ring around the giant planet, they announced yesterday.</p> <p> The discoveries came from the imaging team behind the camera on the US-European space mission Cassini, now in orbit around Saturn. Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London told the British Association festival of science in Exeter yesterday that he spotted the hitherto-unknown moon, only about 5km in diameter, just 1,000 km beyond the planet's outermost ring, the F ring, just days before the spacecraft reached Saturn on July 1. The rings of Saturn are discs of ice and rubble stretching away from Saturn for more than 100,000 km.</p> <p> \"I noticed this barely detectable object skirting the outer part of the F ring,\" he said. \"It was an incredible privilege to be the first person to spot it. The discovery is of at least one and possibly two objects. I would like to say they are moons but we do not actually know yet. There is certainly something there that has to be explained.\"</p> <p> He and colleagues are now trying to calculate the object's orbit. American colleagues found the object again five hours later: however, this time it was in an unexpected place. \"In any other ring system, in any other planet, this would be classified as a satellite, a new moon. But we have to be careful: the F ring is notorious for producing bizarre phenomena.\"</p> <p> He also may have discovered yet another ring, 138,000 kms from the centre, linked to Saturn's moon Atlas. \"The role of the moons in this region was a mystery,\" he said. \"It was while studying the F-ring in these images that I discovered the faint ring of material. My immediate hunch was that it might be associated with the orbit of one of Saturn's moons and after some calculation I identified Atlas as the prime suspect.\"</p>",
  "The basement car park at the Metropolitan medical centre was in a state of barely controlled chaos. <p>Bruised, bloodied and bandaged victims of yesterday's bombing of the Australian embassy were lying on stretchers, slumped in chairs or wandering around, shocked and confused by what had happened to them.</p> <p>Surrounding them were the remnants of a hospital struggling to cope with the rush of casualties.</p> <p>Bowls of blood-soaked water and bandages congealed with flesh and blood littered the floor. The odd rubber glove lay among them.</p> <p>In one tiny office, the most badly injured were being attached to drips, while in another three bodies had been laid out.</p> <p>The bloodstained sheets covering them were regularly pulled back for the benefit of the numerous television cam era crews swarming through the area. \"It's crazy here,\" said Sri Rudiawati, a nurse. \"We have treated more than 50 people in about 45 minutes and still they are coming. I don't know how much longer we can go on like this for.\"</p> <p>By the end of the day, staff at the centre, five buildings away from the embassy, would have treated about 100 people. The casualty toll was nine dead and more than 180 injured.</p> <p>Jeri Langi, 46, a marketing executive, was gingerly touching the points on his head where shards of glass from his car windows had been embedded.</p> <p>\"I was trying to do a U-turn near the embassy when suddenly I heard a big bang and the whole place blew up,\" he said. \"Then all the glass in the car shattered and the car stopped.</p> <p>\"I cried out, 'God help me!' I thought I was finished. I don't know where the bomb came from, I was so confused.\"</p> <p>Mr Jeri said he got out of his car into a scene of mayhem. \"There were lots of people crying,\" he said. \"I saw lots of legs separated [from their] bodies. Hands and arms were also separated. I don't know how many, but it was a lot.\"</p> <p>Helped by a couple of passers-by, Mr Jeri was taken to the nearby hospital. Even though he was one of the first to arrive, he was taken straight to the car park because there was nowhere else to put him.</p> <p>As in all the buildings in the neighbourhood, all the windows in the seven-storey hospital on the side nearest the embassy were blown out.</p> <p>On the road the situation was equally chaotic. The 10-lane Rasuna Said Street, one of the two main arteries through Jakarta's business district, was a carpet of broken glass, fallen leaves and branches and the occasional body part.</p> <p>Thousands of workers from devastated office blocks lined the road, trying to find friends and colleagues from whom they had been separated, unhappy with the police trying to keep them back from the bomb site.</p> <p>\"Give me a signal. Give me a signal,\" Erwien Kurniawan shouted at his mobile phone. \"I need to call my wife. I need to tell her I'm OK.\"</p> <p>\"It's appalling what's happened here,\" he said.</p> <p>Three Indonesian staff from the embassy were consoling each other.</p> <p>\"We're just in such shock,\" said one of the women, who was shaking. \"As I left the building I saw this dead woman under a pile of newspaper. She must have just collected her visa and was leaving the building.</p> <p>\"Next to her was her young son, crying like crazy. I don't know how come she died and he survived. Maybe she shielded him from the blast.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the luckiest of the survivors were Suri Rahayi, 28, and Budi Hariyanto, 30, who had just left the embassy compound after collecting visas.</p> <p>\"We were perhaps 10 steps from the gate when I saw this flash of light, and so we immediately threw ourselves to the ground,\" Ms Suri said. \"That saved our lives, because there was then this huge explosion and bits of glass up to a metre long started falling. It was like rain.\"</p> <p>Mr Budi said there must have been about 20 people around them, nearer the explosion. \"I don't know what happened to them,\" he said. \"After the explosion we got up and ran for safety.\"</p> <p>Ms Suri appeared completely unscathed, and Mr Budi had a small scratch on his right shin. \"We were so lucky,\" Ms Suri said.</p>",
  "<p>It's official: the Germans have gone soft. And not just spongy - they've been reduced to somewhere around the melting, oozing fondue stage: in short, the Germans have fallen in love. With Jurgen Klinsmann.</p> <p>Klinsmann seems like a decent sort but he's so bowled over by the attention, he's even allowing an entire nation to coo - in that sickly, new-parent manner - 'Klinsi' every time they sit fawning over his picture. </p> <p>\"Good luck Klinsi,\" read splotchy painted messages scattered around the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, where Germany took on Brazil on Wednesday night.</p> <p>\"Wishing you every success Klinsi!\" screamed another, a particularly impressive effort unreeled across some 50ft and pinned meticulously in place, allowing no stray creases to dint the message.</p> <p>The noise around the newly revamped stadium was exceptional. It was the sort of sound that seared into one ear, made a brave rush for the other side, but was cut short by exploding into a warm, sticky mess in the middle of your head, leaving you to wonder how long it really takes to go deaf. Hooters, whistles, screaming women, roaring men and an incessant Samba band all combined to make it a hard night on the eardrums.</p> <p>And 'Klinsi' himself was worked up for the occasion, treating reporters to such delicacies as: \"Just the name Brazil, it melts on your tongue, you can't wait for it to happen.\"</p> <p>The Bild were sure it was going to be the footballfest! of the year, refusing to use the word Brazil without prefixing it with 'World Champions' - the only exception being substitution for the phrase 'five times World Champions'. Klinsmann told them \"Playing Brazil, in Berlin, for my first home game - it doesn't get any better.\"</p> <p>The first half seemed to prove him right. The crowd was faultless, in full pantomime mode, cheering and hissing in all the right places. There was even a Mexican wave, started apropos of nothing and confusing a passing ice-cream seller, shocked to find that suddenly the whole of M block was after a Magnum Moment.</p> <p>On the pitch things looked good too. Despite the Berliner Kurier's best attempts to jazz things up with a team sheet reading Dribbelinho (Gerald Asamoah) and Hattrickao (Kevin Kuranyi), the Germans look, on paper, like a troupe of well-meaning journeymen - but they translated their skills into a much better proposition on the pitch. </p> <p>They were not overawed by their [five times World Champion] visitors, they played things nice and simple, and they put together one or two moves in the final third the Brazilians themselves might have been proud of. </p> <p>Even after they went behind to Ronaldinho's superbly taken freekick (edge of the area, barely a step away let alone any backswing, lofted right over wall and flailing keeper), Germany played, well, like Klinsi would have done. With gusto.</p> <p>They were rewarded with a Kevin Kuranyi equalizer which ensured that headlines on the wonder of not losing to Brazil (who, did we happen to mention, are World Champions) did not end up on the printing room floor.</p> <p>Unfortunately it also ensured that the game ploughed on to a tepid conclusion. Germany were not going to let Klinsi's draw slip away, and Brazil didn't really seem to care either way. Watching them was, for large parts, like playing Scrabble with your dad: you could see in his eyes he wasn't really trying. </p> <p>A draw was enough to see them keep a firm hold on their dignity, and it also allowed their hosts to throw lots of beer onto the new, spruced up Olympic stonework; to sing lustily through the streets for many hours to come, and to metaphorically hoist Jurgen Klinsmann up onto their red, yellow and black shoulders.</p> <p>\"Klinsi and Kuranyi bring fresh encouragement\" bellowed Thursday's Bild Sport front page. \"Klinsi, Klinsi, what have you just done with our team?\" panted the introduction. \"Suddenly our problems are no more - we played really good football!\" </p> <p>There's a bit of love's famous myopia in there, but for now it seems German football can surf the crest of a wave of Klinsi mania. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:georgina.turner@theguardian.com\">georgina.turner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A Georgian journalist detained by Russian authorities after reporting on the Beslan school massacre was drugged, according to medical experts, raising fresh concerns about press freedom in Russia.</p> <p>She is the second journalist to claim she was poisoned while trying to cover the school siege in North Ossetia - earlier this week Anna Politkovskaya, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, said she had been drugged on a flight to a nearby airport.</p> <p>Nana Lezhava of the independent Georgian broadcaster Rustavi-2 said she had slept for 24 hours while in the custody of the Russian authorities after being given coffee in her cell, and felt ill when she woke up.</p> <p>Gela Lezhava of the Georgian drug research institute told reporters that urine samples taken from Lezhava after her release this week showed traces of tranquilisers, and that he suspected the journalist was drugged.</p> <p>The tests were conducted at the request of Rustavi-2, which aired an interview with Lezhava and her colleague, cameraman Levan Tetvadze, earlier this week in which she complained feeling weak.</p> <p>\"On Monday evening I was offered coffee. I drunk it and woke up only at 8pm next day. I don't remember how I was carried into the isolation ward of federal security service,\" she said in the interview. </p> <p>Politkovskaya of the daily Novaya Gazeta told a similar story this week. She fell ill after drinking tea given to her on a flight from Moscow to Beslan to report on the school siege.</p> <p>Writing for the Guardian this week, Politkovskaya told how the nurse in the hospital she was taken to had told her she had been poisoned.</p> <p>\"The nurse tells me that when they brought me in I was 'almost hopeless'. Then she whispers, 'My dear, they tried to poison you.' All the tests taken at the airport have been destroyed - on orders 'from on high', say the doctors.\"</p> <p>Lezhava and Tetvadze were accused of violating visa rules when they entered Russia from neighbouring Georgia and prevented from covering the aftermath of the tragedy. Rustavi-2 maintained the pair did not need visas to enter Russia.</p> <p>Both journalists were released on Wednesday after the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, personally contacted the Mr Putin. No charges have been brought against them and their employers claim their detention was a \"gross violation\" of their human rights.</p> <p>The coverage of the Beslan massacre has divided the Russian press with state TV channels failing to cover the first hour of the horror unfolding last Friday morning. They have also been accused of holding back on criticism of the way Mr Putin handled the siege.</p> <p>And in the press there have also been recriminations with Raf Shakirov, the editor of daily newspaper Izvestiya, sacked after his reports proved too raw and emotional for its Kremlin-loving metal magnate proprietor.</p> <p>Politkovskaya, who has a reputation for fearless writing about the Chechnya war, said she feared the Russian media were stepping back into a \"Soviet abyss\".</p> <p>She pointed out that the Russian Union of Journalists conspicuously failed to protest against the sacking of Shakirov. </p> <p>\"We are hurtling back into a Soviet abyss, into an information vacuum that spells death from our own ignorance. All we have left is the internet, where information is still freely available. </p> <p>\"For the rest, if you want to go on working as a journalist, it's total servility to Putin. Otherwise, it can be death, the bullet, poison, or trial - whatever our special services, Putin's guard dogs, see fit,\" she said. Another journalist and critic of the Kremlin's policy in Chechnya, Andrei Babitsky of Radio Free Europe, never made it to Beslan after being detained by Russian authorities.</p> <p>Research released this week showed that just 13% of Russians trust media reports about the tragedy, in which at least 335 people died.</p> <p>Eighty-five per cent of respondents expressed disbelief in the reports, according to the poll conducted across Russia by the St Petersburg-based Independent Analytical Centre last weekend.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Hurricane Ivan was heading towards Jamaica last night after devastating Grenada with 160mph winds, leaving at least 23 people dead in five countries and thousands of homes damaged or destroyed.</p> <p>The Jamaican prime minister, PJ Patterson, urged his people to pray. \"We have to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Let us pray for God's care,\" he said. \"This is a time that we must demonstrate that we are indeed our brother's and sister's keeper.\" </p> <p>Some 500,000 people - one in five Jamaicans - need to evacuate, said Barbara Carby, head of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management. </p> <p>The most dangerous storm to hit the Caribbean in years is projected to pass over Jamaica, Cuba and into the heart of the southern United States. </p> <p>Details of the death and destruction in Grenada are only emerging now because the storm cut all communications after hitting the island on Tuesday and Wednesday. </p> <p>\"We are terribly devastated, it's beyond imagination,\" said Grenada's prime minister, Keith Mitchell, from a Royal Navy warship helping with the rescue. </p> <p>The US declared Grenada a disaster area and released $50,000 (\u00a328,000) for emergency relief. \"This is just a jump start,\" said the US agency for international development. \"We'll send more.\" </p> <p>US officials told tourists and residents to leave the Florida Keys because Ivan could hit by Sunday; it is the third evacuation in a month after Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances. </p> <p>On Grenada, Royal Navy crews from two ships said yesterday that they had cleared the flooded airport outside the capital, St George's, and that emergency relief flights were starting to arrive. </p> <p>The Grenadian prime minister confirmed that the island's 17th century stone prison had been \"completely devastated\", allowing its inmates to escape, including leftwingers jailed for 20 years for killings in 1983 in an internal power struggle that led to an invasion by the United States. </p> <p>Mr Mitchell, whose home was flattened, said that nine-tenths of all houses were damaged and he feared the death toll would rise. He said much island agriculture had been destroyed, including the staple nutmeg crop. </p> <p>A UN spokesman estimated that virtually every major building in St George's had suffered damage, and said that it was sending a disaster team. </p> <p>\"It looks like a landslide happened,\" said Nicole Organ, 21, a student from Toronto at St George's University, which overlooks the capital. \"There are all these colours coming down the mountainside - sheets of metal, pieces of shacks.\" </p> <p>Students, mostly Americans, were arming themselves with knives, sticks and pepper spray against looters, said Sonya Lazarevic, 36, from New York City. Ms Organ said she saw bands of men carrying machetes looting a hardware store. She said she saw a bank with its glass facade intact on her way down that was smashed when she returned. </p> <p>Grenada's police commissioner, Roy Bedaau, said every police station was damaged, hindering efforts to control looting. Trinidad and other Caribbean countries were sending troops, he added. </p> <p>The storm strengthened early yesterday to become a category five, on a scale of five. It packed sustained winds of 160mph (255kph), with higher gusts as it passed north of the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. </p> <p>Its howling winds and drenching rains flooded parts of Venezuela's north coast. </p> <p>Ivan is expected to reach Jamaica today and Cuba by the weekend, the US national hurricane centre in Miami said. </p> <p>\"After Jamaica it's probably going to hit somewhere in the US,\" said a meteorologist, Jennifer Pralgo. \"We're hoping it's not Florida again.\" </p> <p>Hurricane Charley killed 27 people last month and caused an estimated $6.8bn (\u00a33.8bn) in insured damage. Not even a category four storm had hit the Caribbean since Hurricane Luis in 1995. Hurricane Gilbert was only category three when it devastated Jamaica in 1988. </p> <p>The island has been on hurricane watch since Wednesday and has ordered schools closed and fishermen to pull their skiffs ashore. Haiti's south-west peninsula was also on hurricane watch; the city of Les Cayes suffered hours of downpours on Wednesday. </p> <p>Les Cayes residents worried that Ivan would bring disaster equal to the May floods that killed 1,700 people along the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. </p> <p>Yesterday Ivan was centred 455 miles south-east of Kingston, Jamaica. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles and tropical storm-force winds a further 160 miles. The storm centre was moving west-northwest at 17mph.</p>",
  "Russia yesterday rounded on Britain for having granted political asylum to Akhmed Zakayev, a spokesman for the Chechen separatist leader that Moscow claims is behind the Beslan school massacre, and letting him live in London. <p>Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, said yesterday: \"Granting asylum to people involved in terrorism - and Russia has documented evidence of this - effectively undermines the unity of the anti-terrorist coalition.\" </p> <p>In an interview published in the centrist Vremya Novosti newspaper, Mr Lavrov said that asylum enabled \"terrorists to hide behind ... the official position\" of the countries granting them such status. He acknowledged that in some countries the executive branch of government could not interfere in court decisions; nevertheless, it could at least \"take measures so that those people [can] not spread terrorism propaganda\". </p> <p>\"It is enough to recall Akhmed Zakayev's statement he made from London, in which he plainly and bluntly ... blamed what happened in Beslan on the Russian leadership,\" Mr Lavrov said. \"The cynicism of this statement is clear to everybody.\" </p> <p>Mr Lavrov said that he did not believe the decision by the British and American governments to offer asylum to Mr Zakayev and another separatist, Ilyas Akhmadov, was a case of \"deliberate\" double-standards; instead he blamed \"inertia\" and hang-ups from the cold war. \"It is difficult to get rid of outdated stereotypes, but, although I don't want to look immodest, we are managing to do this faster than our partners,\" he said. </p> <p>The comments reopen a year-long feud with London over the fate of Mr Zakayev, who won asylum last November. The Russian prosecutor's office reportedly bungled the presentation of a case seeking his extradition from Britain, increasing the fury in Moscow. </p> <p>The tragedy at Beslan has put new emphasis on the plight of Mr Zakayev, who cannot be extradited unless his asylum is overturned. This could happen if he is proved to have committed a crime. The Russian authorities have so far struggled to make a convincing case that he is connected to terrorism. Mr Zakayev has said he fears for his safety, after another prominent Chechen, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, was assassinated, presumably by Russian agents, in Doha, Qatar, in February. </p> <p>At the least Mr Zakayev will face Russian attempts to use the international sympathy extended after the Beslan massacre to have him extradited. Any ultimate decision over his extradition will rest with the home secretary, David Blunkett, who is also in charge of anti-terrorism efforts in the UK. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, described Moscow's statement yesterday that it reserved the right to pre-emptively strike at terrorist bases anywhere in the world as an \"understandable\" reaction. </p> <p>Britain's position is that, if Russia has evidence against Mr Zakayev that would stand up in court, it should hand it over; otherwise there is no case for extradition. </p> <p>A Foreign Office official with detailed knowledge of the dispute said Russia last brought up Mr Zakayev's extradition in July, when Mr Straw visited Moscow. He said: \"They have never stopped asking for it.\" He said no new attempt to have him extradited had been initiated since the Beslan tragedy. Mr Zakayev could not be reached for comment. </p> <p>A senior official with the Russian security service, the FSB, voiced a commonly held opinion in Moscow that Mr Zakayev had been granted asylum because he was useful to Britain. \"Maybe he's helpful if they want to criticise Russia. I can't see another motive.\"</p> <p>In another development, a separatist Chechen website offered $20m (\u00a311.2m) for the \"head of President Putin\", saying, among other things, that he was guilty of organising the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Chechen civilians, including children. </p> <p>A day earlier, Moscow had put a $10m bounty on the heads of a militant Chechen commander, Shamil Basayev, and the separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov.</p>",
  "Robert Kilroy-Silk, the former Labour MP turned daytime TV star, returned to his old Westminster haunts yesterday to warn the \"metropolitan political elite\" that the UK Independence party intends to defeat the European superstate and \"change the face of British politics forever\". <p>In a speech which deftly mixed self-deprecating humour and combative politics with lacerating attacks on \"lying politicians\" and \"lazy, sloppy\" media, Mr Kilroy-Silk repeatedly predicted that an angry and betrayed electorate is poised to overthrow the \"old politics\" and that he intends to be its instrument. </p> <p>Claiming to have contacts and friendships within both the Labour cabinet and Tory shadow cabinet - including Jack Straw, \"a very good friend of mine\" - he said Ukip was already influencing the major party agenda and would do so increasingly. </p> <p>Apart from British withdrawal from the EU - \"the single issue that is most important to me is self-government\" - his most specific pledges during his address to the parliamentary press gallery was to stand at the coming general election. </p> <p>He has picked a seat somewhere in the east Midlands where he cruised to a spectacular result, narrowly in second place behind the Tories, and became an elected Ukip MEP in June. </p> <p>\"We have been promised the money to fight every marginal seat\" that Ukip leaders considered important, he said. \"That money is in place and it's open ended.\" </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk, MP for Ormskirk in Lancashire from 1974 to 1983 when he quit after a running feud with the Militant Tendency, refused to divulge his sources of funds - \"as much as I need\" - though Paul Sykes, the anti-EU Yorkshire businessman, was the key donor in the June Euro-elections when Ukip ended up with 12 seats. </p> <p>But he made no secret of his contempt for \"the old politics and the old parties\" along with every politician he mentioned except Tony Benn, who he sees as also rejecting the lies and deceits of mainstream politics. </p> <p>There will be no pacts or alliances with any of them, said Mr Kilroy-Silk, who is not yet Ukip's leader, but spoke as if he was. </p> <p>\"People are deeply angry about the way they are made to feel guilty about being proud to be British or ashamed to celebrate Christmas,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Are we allowed to say that this is a terrible thing to have done to ordinary decent people?\" </p> <p>The ex-MP, whose successful morning show, Kilroy, was dropped by the BBC after he made savagely sweeping generalisations about Islam - many repeated at Westminster yesterday, insists that he is still the leftwinger he once was on civil liberties, anti-racism, equality, poverty, aid to the third world and even progressive taxation \"for people like me\". </p> <p>But he revealed a bleak view of a country alienated from its past; not racist, he insisted, but angry about the lies told about immigration and about a \"bureaucratic and corrupt\" Europe. Political correctness was another of his targets. </p> <p>Asked if he would ban the Islamic headscarf, the hajib, he said no, although he opposes multi-culturalism that threatens British culture. </p> <p>\"People say 'isn't Kelly Holmes a triumph for multi-culturalism?' No she isn't. She's British and always has been,\" he told reporters he had already repeatedly chided for lazy, London-based reporting. </p> <p>His supporters, fans of his TV show, have to suffer the policies which elite politicians avoid for themselves and their children - \"doing a Diane Abbott or a Harriet Harman and taking their kids away\". </p> <p>But he praised his own wife, Jan, who had been billed as the brains behind his career. \"She's at home cleaning under the fridge - under, not behind it, we've moved on,\" he said in a joke about Godfrey Bloom, the Ukip's anti-feminist MEP.</p>",
  "Ayman al- Zawahiri, second in command of al-Qaida, said last night that the US faced defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan. <p>In a videotape broadcast by the Arab satellite television station al-Jazeera, he said: \"The Americans in both countries are between two fires. If they continue they bleed to death and if they withdraw they lose everything.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Southern and eastern Afghanistan have completely become an open field for the mujahideen. The Americans are hiding in their trenches and refuse to come out to face the mujahideen, as the mujahideen shell them, fire on them and cut roads off around them. Their defence is only to bomb by air.\" </p> <p>Mr Zawahiri was last heard in March, when al-Jazeera broadcast an audio tape in which he called on Pakistanis to overthrow their government. </p> <p>Yesterday's broadcast was made within hours of a Pakistani military attack on a suspected al-Qaida training camp near the Afghan border, reportedly killing at least 50 militants and an unknown number of civilians. </p> <p>Fighter jets and helicopter gunships attacked the camp near Dila Khula in the restive South Waziristan tribal area, destroying two mud-walled buildings and sending up plumes of smoke. A Pakistani military spokesman, Major General Shaukat Sultan, said most of the 50 militants killed were foreigners, mainly Uzbeks, Chechens and Arabs, and that they had proved links with al-Qaida. </p> <p>\"I don't think they put up a fight. They were taken by surprise,\" he said. </p> <p>Details of the attack were difficult to confirm, since foreign and most local media are forbidden from entering South Waziristan. </p> <p>Although military personnel described the bombing as \"surgical\", villagers suggested that up to 90 people, many of them civilians, may have died. </p> <p>One local resident, Ajab Nur, told Reuters news agency that 40 Taliban fighters and other Islamist militants in the camp were killed in the initial strike. </p> <p>Minutes later dozens of villagers who rushed to the scene were killed by a second wave of bombs, he said. </p> <p>Another resident told Associated Press that dust and smoke could be seen rising from three other villages hit in the attack. </p> <p>Gen Sultan said the army had been monitoring the camp, which he said included an explosives training facility. </p> <p>Asked to comment on civilian casualties, he said: \"They were all militants, and if there were any locals they would have to be part of those militants.\"</p>",
  "In common with our partners in Russia, part of the EU-funded European Human Rights Advocacy Centre, we are horrified by the recent events in Beslan and condemn the methods of those who perpetrated these crimes (Leaders; Ahmed Zakayev, September 7).

They all claim to be victims of grave violations of their human rights and include mothers whose children were killed by the Russian bombing of civilian refugee columns leaving Grozny at the end of 1999. </p> <p>Our experience in taking cases to Strasbourg in relation to the conflict in south-east Turkey has convinced us that no peaceful settlement is possible in such regional conflagrations unless the government concerned respects fundamental human rights.

Despite the enormous sacrifices and strides Russia has made in the past 15 years toward becoming building a successful democracy, all it has received in return is double-crossing trickery, economic theft and exploitation, and western support of enemies of the Russian state. </p> <p>In particular, the west seeks to deny Russia control of the oil pipelines being built to carry Caspian Sea oil to the oil-hungry world, instead placing control in the hands of anti-democratic, Islamic extremists - a truly brilliant move given that Russia is the only serious democracy in the region.

  "Indonesian and Australian investigators will today continue sifting through the wreckage caused by a massive bomb which exploded outside the Australian embassy compound in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, yesterday morning, killing at least nine people and injuring 182. <p>Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, flew to Jakarta last night, along with the federal police chief and head of the domestic intelligence agency. Mr Downer, who described the bombing as a \"brutal, cruel and callous attack\", said his government would provide \"every support to the Indonesian government and officials to catch those responsible\". With him were Australian forensic experts, who immediately went to help local police scour the scene. The blast devastated about 10 multistorey office buildings, destroyed a dozen passing cars and could be heard up to 10 miles away. </p> <p>Indonesia and Australia both immediately blamed Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a militant Islamist group linked to al-Qaida, for the attack. </p> <p>Last night an Arabic internet forum carried a purported JI statement claiming responsibility, Reuters news agency reported. It warned of more attacks unless Australia withdraws forces from Iraq. </p> <p>\"We decided to make Australia pay in Jakarta today when one of the mujahideen brothers carried out a martyrdom operation at the Australian embassy,\" the statement said. </p> <p>\"We advise all Australians to get out of Indonesia, or we will make it a grave for them ... and the Australian government to get out of Iraq, and if it doesn't we will direct a number of painful blows.\" </p> <p>It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the statement which appeared in a chat room that has sometimes carried claims from Islamic groups which turned out to be false. </p> <p>Last night analysts were divided on how the attack would affect Australia's federal election on October 9. There were suspicions that the bombing was designed to emulate the Madrid train attack in March, which was credited with turning opinion against Jose Maria Aznar's government. </p> <p>The prime minister, John Howard, has come under intense criticism over his decision to back the war, which his opponents say has made Australia more vulnerable to terror attacks. \"This is not a nation that is going to be intimidated by acts of terrorism,\" Mr Howard said last night. </p> <p>All yesterday's fatalities were Indonesian, four of them police or civilian security officers. Another was an embassy gardener and a sixth a woman collecting a visa. Three were passersby. </p> <p>About a dozen Australians were slightly hurt by flying glass and collapsing ceilings, as were four Chinese nationals, and three Greek diplomats in their embassy on the 12th floor of a neighbouring building. </p> <p>The bomb left a crater several metres deep outside the Australian embassy compound and blew a 10-metre hole in the security fence, but the heavily fortified building suffered only minor damage. </p> <p>The Greek mission, in contrast, was gutted, as were scores of offices in buildings along the 10-lane Rasuna Said Street in the heart of Jakarta's business district. </p> <p>An Australian embassy spokeswoman said the mission and the consulate in Bali would be closed until further notice and that non-essential staff and dependents had been given the option of repatriation. </p> <p>The Indonesian president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was in neighbouring Brunei for a royal wedding, cut short her visit and went straight to the scene on her return. </p> <p>Indonesia's police chief, General Da'i Bachtiar, said the bombers' method virtually mirrored the Bali bombing in 2002 that killed 202 and last year's bombing of Jakarta's Marriott hotel that killed 12.</p>",
  "<p>The United Kingdom population looks set to top 60 million before the end of this summer, following figures yesterday from the Office for National Statistics showing it climbed to a record high in 2003. </p> <p>After adjusting the totals for the past three years to take account of people missed during the 2001 census, the population reached 59.6 million in June 2003 - 400,000 more than the year before. </p> <p>The increase was the same as in 2002 and one more step of this magnitude would have taken the total past 60 million by June this year. </p> <p>But since the average annual growth over the past 12 years has been 300,000, the milestone may be passed a little later. </p> <p>The ONS said immigration was the main reason for the rising population. Only one third of the latest increase was due to an excess of births over deaths. The ONS said that its figures continued the pattern of steady growth in the UK population, which has increased by nearly 2.1 million since 1991.</p> <p>Latest official forecasts suggest that the population will peak at more than 65 million in 2051 before declining gradually to 64.8m in 2071.</p> <p>Almost all the growth will be among older people and the working-age population will start to decline within the next 20 years, leaving the country increasingly dependent on immigrants to maintain its economic vitality. </p> <p>It is forecast that life expectancy will rise to 81 years for men and 84.9 years for women by 2031. </p> <p>The population in Scotland is expected to decline from 5 million to 4.5 million in 2041. Numbers in Wales and Northern Ireland are projected to peak in 2031 at 3.1 million and 1.8 million respectively, leaving England as the only growth area for the following two decades.</p>",
  "<p>To startled media watchers, political documentaries have become commercially viable, with customers paying hard cash to be enlightened, excoriated and browbeaten by the likes of Michael Moore and other less flamboyant crusaders whose rants would normally be confined to public television. Films about al-Jazeera (Control Room) and corporate malfeasance (The Corporation), have received theatrical openings, as have cinematic essays on the arterial dangers of a McDonald's diet (Super Size Me), the egregiousness of Fox Television (Outfoxed), the machinations of Karl Rove (Bush's Brain), the illegal retention of immigrants (Persons of Interest). </p> <p>Needless to say, most of these are from the left-liberal side of the political spectrum, which finds itself locked in a titanic struggle to defeat the Bush juggernaut in November. </p> <p>But what about narrative cinema? What are the ideological underpinnings during this critical moment? In the old days, vigilantes were on the alert for communist rhetoric shoehorned into the most innocent of Hollywood scripts. Adrian Scott, one of the Hollywood 10, worked on the screenplay of Swing Time, contributing the following exchange. Fred Astaire's debonair but impoverished gambler has inadvertently given his \"lucky\" nickel for change to working girl Ginger Rogers. A misunderstanding grows into a shouting match when a cop appears and, taking Astaire in dance costume for a swell, immediately sides with him. \"We have to protect rich people like you from crazy dames like her,\" he assures Astaire, to which Rogers shoots back: \"You Cossack!\" </p> <p>Surely, in these polarised times, the blandest films aren't immune from the sneak attack. Can we detect biases favourable or unfavourable to the Republican party in recent offerings? </p> <p>We Don't Live Here Anymore, with its erotically charged quartet, appears to be a throwback to a 1970s sex-lib fascination with wife-swapping, a darker, sexier and more maudlin version of Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice. The adulterous shenanigans of the two couples - English profs Peter Krause and Mark Ruffalo, married, respectively, to Naomi Watts and Laura Dern - might be seized upon by the right as proof of the decline of family values, just the sort of selfish behaviour typical of east coast smartypants secular bohemians. On the other hand, the world of the film, adapted from two Andre Dubus novellas, is so pre-feminist that the two wives, despite severe shortages of income, never consider getting a job ... or forming a consciousness-raising group to complain about their lying husbands. Blue or red? Ambiguous. </p> <p>While most of the major studios are running from overtly political themes - Disney having passed on Fahrenheit 9/11 and Warners on David O Russell's Iraq documentary - 20th Century Fox surprised with Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow, a virtual screed on the dire consequences of global warming. Mostly it was a special effects extravaganza, in which Los Angeles is decimated by tornadoes and New York submerged under ice. The movie would seem to wear its Democratic heart on its sleeve; the obstructionist economy-first vice president bears an undisguised resemblance to Dick Cheney. On the other hand, the two states, California and New York, that serve as targets are solidly in the blue state alignment. </p> <p>Any movie sympathetic to gays (A Home at the End of the World) obviously falls into the liberal camp, but even Shrek 2 addresses bigotry. Thanks to his marriage to Princess Fiona, Shrek now stands at the portals of respectability. But will his aristocratic in-laws accept him? Can mum and dad overcome class and species (red state) prejudices and embrace not one, but two, ogres in the family, persons of colour? </p> <p>Mum and dad are inhabited by the veddy English voices of John Cleese and Julie Andrews, two of a number of emissaries from the British isles to provide class (red state) and wisdom (neutral). Ian Holm appears as a sadder but wiser Scottish meteorologist in The Day After Tomorrow, one of the few resonant and likable characters, a compensation perhaps for the film's unkind deep freeze of the UK. But the same actor is sad but not so wise as the analyst-father in Zach Braff's winningly befuddled and very personal first film, Garden State. Braff, as a depressed would-be actor who returns home (New Jersey) for his mother's funeral, has been doped up for years with antidepressants by his father, who is also, most unwisely, his analyst. When the young man throws away his \"meds\" and rebels against his imperial father, can we take this as a kind of July 4 parable of the young colony's declaration of independence against British paternalism? </p> <p>Brits like Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole, inhabiting roles rather than adapting them to modern tastes, salvage what there is to salvage in Troy, a softened and liberalised version of Homer's Iliad in which Brad Pitt's buff Achilles is more introspective Hamlet than pre-Renaissance action hero. Unfortunately, blue state liberalism is here profoundly at odds with the essential brutality, the how-glorious-it-is-to-die ethos and pre-Romantic sensibility of ancient Greece. </p> <p>And finally, in a reverse casting gambit, cheeky Reese Witherspoon has been imported to play that grasping and glorious schemer Becky Sharp in Mira Nair's mod-progressive adaptation of Thackeray's sprawling satiric canvas of Victorian England. A parable of post-feminist empowerment - a gal's gotta do what a gal's gotta do - the film says it's okay to root wholeheartedly for this anachronistic material girl. </p> <p>On the fundamentalist right we have Exorcist: the Beginning, but the depredations of the devil are child's play compared with the relentlessly bloody Jesus-flaying spectacle presented in The Passion of the Christ. Indeed, Mel Gibson has become the standard bearer of a nutty holier-than-thou constituency of the perpetually enraged. To his crucifixion opus he has added, as producer, another gratuitously bloodthirsty little number called Paparazzi, which takes a twisted page from the Dodi and Diana story to furnish a self-righteous star with an excuse to go on a homicidal rampage against offending photographers.</p>",
  "<p>The Jockey Club's investigation into Sean Fox's controversial ride on Ice Saint comes to a head today when the rider's appeal against a 21-day ban will be heard. </p> <p>Fox will appear before the Jockey Club disciplinary panel after the racecourse stewards at Fontwell found him guilty of breaching rule 157. </p> <p>They decided he had intentionally stepped off the horse after jumping the ninth fence in the Cantor Sport Beginners' Chase on March 8. </p> <p>The panel will consider the evidence that was before the Fontwell stewards as well as evidence that came to light subsequently as a result of Jockey Club security department investigations. </p> <p>The Jockey Club have the alternative of punishing Fox under rule 158 if they are not satisfied that his actions were intentional. </p> <p>Rule 157 specifies that a rider's actions must be taken \"with the intention of concealing the true ability of the horse or affecting the result of the race\". </p> <p>On the day of the Fontwell race, Ice Saint opened at 2-1 on course before being returned at twice those odds, having also drifted markedly on betting exchanges. </p> <p>At least one other jockey has already been interviewed by Jockey Club officials in connection with the race.</p>"
