  "<p>A project to assess the world's ecosystems has found that the widespread use of fertilisers and the burning of fossil fuels will severely damage life in lakes and rivers around the globe. </p> <p>The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, launched by the World Bank in Washington in 2001, examines how any disruption to the environment, whether by human action or natural events, will harm human health, food production and natural resources. </p> <p>Scientists have spent the past three years piecing together data from thousands of studies. Their official report will be published early next year, but a first draft shows a number of alarming trends. </p> <p>A major concern is the increase in nitrogen emissions because of fertiliser use and the burning of fossil fuels. </p> <p>\"In the past 100 years, emissions have risen from around 20m tonnes a year to more than 150m tonnes a year,\" said Robert Watson, the project leader and the World Bank's chief scientist. \"We're emitting more than seven times more nitrogen and that is going to have incredible implications for ecological systems.\" </p> <p>As an ingredient in fertiliser, nitrogen helps to feed some 2 billion people. But when it is washed from soils into water courses it can make rivers and lakes too rich in nutrients. </p> <p>As a result, algae and other life can grow out of control, eventually stripping oxygen from the water which fish and other aquatic life need. </p> <p>Dead zones have already begun to appear, notably in the Gulf of Mexico, which is fed by nitrogen-rich water from the Mississippi river. \"We are looking at major effects in the US, Europe and south-east Asia,\" Dr Watson said. </p> <p>As the world's population is estimated to grow to 9 billion in 40 years, food production is expected to become more intensive, requiring ever more nitrogen-rich fertiliser. </p> <p>Kenneth Cassman, an expert on environmental health at the University of Nebraska, said the efficiency of nitrogen use needed to be \"massively improved\". \"There are a number among us who think this is more important than carbon emissions, in terms of environmental impact,\" he said. </p> <p>In a separate part of the study, the scientists found that global warming would severely disrupt ecosystems, especially in the developing world, if it was not kept in check. An increase of more than 2C (3.6F) would be enough to severely degrade the availability of food, water and human health in developing countries. </p> <p>Dr Watson, who worked as a scientific adviser to the White House during the Clinton administration, said that while the final report would describe different ways the problems might be dealt with, it was up to governments and private companies to collaborate. </p> <p>\"We can move in a direction where we destroy our natural heritage or we can move in a direction where we improve both human wellbeing and maintain our natural heritage,\" he said. \"We've got choices and we have to decide which future we want.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is not often that charities are compared to pugilists, but the former light-heavyweight boxing champion John Conteh believes their work is similar. </p> <p>Speaking at the Guardian Charity Awards 2004 ceremony yesterday, he told the finalists: \"You deal with tough issues. Like going into a fight, you don't shy away from it, and I'm very grateful for the work that you do.\" </p> <p>The awards, in association with Sainsbury's, recognise the contribution of charities with an income of less than \u00a31m. </p> <p>The winners were: Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group in Crawley, Sussex, which helps detained asylum seekers; Disaster Action in Woking, Surrey, a self-help group for people affected by major disasters; Norfolk and Norwich Families House, which supports vulnerable children and their families; the Food Train, which delivers groceries to and befriends housebound people in Dumfries and Galloway; and the Guy Fox History project, a charity working with children in Southwark in south London. </p> <p>Winners, who received \u00a35,000 and a computer from SmartChange, were chosen because they offer innovative and easily replicable services. </p> <p>The judges included Naomi Eisenstadt, the director of Sure Start; Stuart Etherington, the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations; and David Brindle, the Guardian's public services editor.</p>",
  "<p>Diageo is pressing the government to launch a multi-million pound anti binge-drinking campaign, using the same shock tactics as the hard-hitting drink-drive adverts. </p> <p>The drinks group - whose brands include youth favourites such as Smirnoff Ice, Archers Aqua and Bailey's Glide - has held high level meetings with the Downing Street strategy unit and at the Department of Health to persuade the government to back a campaign. </p> <p>Diageo's advertising agency - Abbott Mead Vickers - has been working on ideas for an issue-based campaign which the government could adopt. AMV has suggested targeting an initial campaign at young women drinkers focusing on their lack of control and vulnerability after binge-drinking. The agency wants to use hard-hitting tactics and shock imagery to get the message across. </p> <p>Another meeting with government is planned. Kate Blakeley, head of social responsibility at Diageo said: \"We want to make binge drinking as socially unacceptable as drink-driving\". Ms Blakeley said Diageo took its responsibility for promoting sensible drinking \"very seriously\", but binge-drinking, along with underage and drink-driving, was a problem for government. </p> <p>She said Diageo would like to see a \"sustained\" anti-binge drinking campaign, modelled on the drink-drive adverts which, although they have been criticised for their shock imagery, are credited with changing public attitudes. </p> <p>As a result of its impact on health and crime, binge-drinking has already become a political issue. </p> <p>Tony Blair waded into the debate this year when he addressed a \"responsible drinking forum\" organised by the Institute of Public Policy Research. The forum - hosted by Diageo - was attended by home office minister Hazel Blears, public health minister Melanie Johnson together with representatives from the police and alcohol treatment services. Mr Blair told the industry binge drinking was in danger of becoming \"the new British disease\". </p> <p>Diageo's efforts to seize the initiative in talks with government have only served to anger other industry players. Several of Britain's largest brewers and pub operators tore up invitations to the IPPR meeting. </p> <p>They are keen for the industry to maintain a united position through the Portman Group and the British Beer &amp; Pub Association. </p> <p>Some drinks groups - particularly those with profits from premium brands to protect, like Diageo - are nevertheless concerned that these industry-funded trade groups are not moving fast enough to meet the growing problem. </p> <p>They fear that the relaxation of licensing laws next year, which will allow bars to stay open for longer hours, is likely to exacerbate the problem and that unless action is taken the problem will backfire on them and, ultimately, their profits. </p> <p>But many struggling high street bar operators have more immediate concerns. They are locked in a price war as they fight for limited custom in an overcrowded market. </p> <p>The resulting happy hour promotions and price cuts have been condemned by politicians, police and health authorities, but few operators have paid heed. </p> <p>The drinks industry funds The Portman Group to act as an independent lobby group to promote responsible drinking, but there is understood to be concern among the biggest drinks companies about the progress it is making.</p>",
  "Up to 4,000 asylum seekers drown at sea every year as they flee persecution or poverty, according to newly published British research. <p>Fear of terrorism and public scares about mass migration have led to more vigilant coastal patrols and an international climate that discourages captains from stopping to help small boats in distress, says Professor Michael Pugh of Plymouth University. </p> <p>His figures derive from interviews with refugees, records of bodies washed up on shores, wrecks and government statistics. </p> <p>They suggest that about 2,000 people perish annually in the Mediterranean trying to reach prosperous European states. A similar number are thought to die on crossings to Australia and the United States - the two other main destinations for boat people. </p> <p>Prof Pugh, who believes that he is the first to produce such global statistics, stresses that the numbers are, inevitably, estimates. </p> <p>Up to a third of the people who set out on perilous crossings fail to land safely, he says in his study, Drowning not Waving, published in the Jour nal of Refugee Studies. \"The Spanish produce reasonable records of the bodies they find, but many people think that's an underestimate. </p> <p>\"It's a hidden tragedy because there are few aid organisations at sea to monitor the situation and undertake rescues. In the past, captains were concerned that they were being decoyed by people who might turn out to be pirates. Now their concerns are that they could be attacked by al-Qaida.\" </p> <p>Such fears, says Prof Pugh, are usually unfounded. \"There are far easier ways of attacking western targets and it's the lives of refugees and migrants that are most at risk. Yet politicians in the UK, southern Europe and Australia have fabricated refugees and migrants as a 'security threat', even sending out warships to turn back boats on the high seas. In part, this is to make capital in domestic politics.\" </p> <p>Three German aid workers were arrested recently after their ship, Cap Anamur, docked in Sicily with 37 African refugees they had picked up from an inflatable dinghy. The asylum seekers initially claimed to be fleeing the stricken Darfur region of Sudan, but were later shown to be from Ghana and Nigeria. The vessels hired by those trafficking migrants and asylum seekers are often old and unseaworthy, Prof Pugh points out. \"Many have no, or only limited, navigation aids or charts. They have unreliable engines and steering and little by way of safety equipment.\" </p> <p>Last week, 64 African migrants were feared drowned after their overcrowded boat capsized en route from Tunisia to the Italian island of Lampedusa. Most of the victims were thought to be Moroccans. </p> <p>Prof Pugh, who lectures in international relations, suspects that the numbers dying at sea have risen recently. Fatality rates were probably higher, however, during the 1970s, when tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people crossed the South China Sea. Many were attacked by pirates. </p> <p>\"The International Maritime Organisation should encourage support for seafarers who adhere scrupulously to the norms of humanitarianism at sea,\" Prof Pugh concludes, \"if necessary regulating the shipping industry to ensure that masters are not penalised for bona fide rescue deviations and delays.\"</p>",
  "The Hilton hotel in Taba hosted some of the first and the last Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, beginning with the tentative and hopeful discussions of 1993 and ending in their bitter collapse nine years later. <p>But the hotel was itself the subject of intense diplomatic wrangling as a sideshow to Israel's peace deal with Cairo when both sides claimed ownership as the Sinai desert was handed back to Egypt. </p> <p>The hotel was built by an Israeli, Eli Paposhido, yards inside what would become the border. Today it towers over the Egyptian immigration post but 22 years ago Israel fought to keep the hotel, then called the Avia Sonesta, in its territory. But the peace agreement with Egypt was clear. </p> <p>The mayor of the neighbouring Israeli town of Eilat demanded the hotel be demolished so that it did not compete with hotels in his jurisdiction. But Mr Paposhido was forced to sell his hotel to the Egyptian government, which then sold it to the Hilton group. </p> <p>The Israeli employees were sacked and replaced with Egyptian staff. Under a special agreement, Israeli guests did not need visas. The Hilton had a special desk before immigration to escort them past officials on the short walk to the casinos that helped keep the hotel packed for much of the year. </p> <p>The Israeli guests may have technically stepped into a foreign country - and an Arab one at that - but many said that even after Israel handed back the Sinai they felt at home visiting it. </p> <p>Thursday night's carnage will have changed all that.</p>",
  "The Muscovites' rural retreats are alive with the sound of - bulldozers. After years of the new rich ploughing their dubiously acquired wealth into vast country dachas, the authorities, anxious to remind everyone who is in charge, are tearing them down. <p>The first victim was in Silver Springs, a small but elite settlement near the exclusive Gorky 2 area in the Zvenigorod region. The state newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta ran a large picture on its front page yesterday of a two-storey building in its mock-Tudor splendour and another, taken moments later, of the bulldozer picking its way through the rubble. </p> <p>Instead of tearing down the more palatial residences on the land, the bulldozer went straight for the outhouse where the servants live and the telephone exchange is kept. A parrot - the house's only remaining resident - died during the procedure. </p> <p>Oleg Mitvol who, as head of the federal agency for surveying the use of natural resources, has become chief scourge of the luxury dacha, was on hand with a busload of journalists. </p> <p>The company which owned the house decided to destroy it rather than go to court, he explained. But without court approval, \"we can't drive bulldozers and destroy other cottages. </p> <p>\"I hope that after this case many would think it is better to destroy a cottage than to spend years in court.\" </p> <p>He added that the house was destroyed because it was allegedly on land which had been appropriated improperly. </p> <p>The drama was designed to send a message to the owners of 1,500 other dachas accused of breaking the law, and the other 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) of illegally acquired land. </p> <p>The bulldozer has long been a feature of the Moscow woods, albeit there to build up rather than rip down dachas. In the past few years fences have been going up all over the woods as private companies seek to seal off land for hugely profitable developments. </p> <p>Compounds with names like Dreamland, behind whose high gates lurk fake Tudor mansions, provide status symbols to rich Russians. To a people who can still remember what it was like to all be equal, it is yet another way of feeling different from, or better than, your neighbour. </p> <p>The campaign to rein in the growth of dachas across Moscow's rural hinterland has raged all summer. Some believe the authorities are seeking to punish the corrupt elite, others that they want to extract \"fines\" for the land's corrupt sale (a hefty payoff to the state to maintain the status quo). </p> <p>The more cynical maintain that the government is anxious to get its hands on better dacha plots for its new top officials. </p> <p>The effort to reclaim these highly desirable stretches of countryside has even reached the top of Moscow society. Alla Pugachova - a Russian blend of Cilla Black and Cher - is being investigated because her dacha may have violated laws about building near a riverbank. </p> <p>Former president Boris Yeltsin has even been implicated in the dubious acquisition of land for a dacha. </p> <p>The Moscow prosecutor claims that the Kremlin kingmaker Boris Berezovsky, who now lives with political asylum in London, got 14 hectares of land in 1999 for his daughter by \"abusing his authority\". Mr Berezovsky says Mr Yeltsin gave him the land by decree, and the Kremlin is trying to get at him and the ex-president. </p> <p>As usual in Russia, a larger power struggle is at play. And, as usual, it claims a few innocent bystanders - even if it is only a small house and a dead parrot.</p>",
  "Slaves found oil deep in the forests of the tiny west African island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 more than 200 years ago. In recent times, a company surveyed the bubbling pools of crude with a view to exploiting it, but concluded it was not possible. What the locals call the \"petrol mine\" near Uba Budo is now a rarely visited geological curiosity; for a few dollars, children will lead you down a slithery path to collect a bottle full of the \"black gold\" that drives the world. <p>Two hours' drive away, in the capital, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 city - a dozy, delightful place of a few thousand people where not much works - the smell of oil is becoming all-pervasive. A far more rewarding source has been discovered than the muddy hollow at Uba Budo. Three years ago, the world's largest oil company, ExxonMobil, found vast offshore deposits reckoned to be between 4bn and 10bn barrels. The first contracts have been awarded, and sooner or later the first $100m down payment will be paid to one of the most impoverished and indebted countries in the world. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, coupled with the even smaller island of Principe, straddling the equator, has won the geological lottery: a state the size of the Isle of Wight, with a population of just 150,000, could soon become the Qatar or Kuwait of Africa. Its people, mainly dirt-poor subsistence farmers, will theoretically be worth millions of dollars each within a generation. The interest alone on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's expected oil finds in a few years should repair its diabolical roads, pay off its $300m debt, wipe out its rampant malaria and rebuild its decrepit schools and hospitals. There could be so much money that no S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an need ever work again. </p> <p>In theory. But all leading economists know that when a poor country finds oil, it is more often a curse than a blessing. The history of all the other oil-producing countries in the region - Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Congo, Chad, Cameroon - shows that sudden petro-wealth can swamp a poor country, rip apart its culture, divide its people, destabilise its governments, lead to massive corruption and human rights abuses, encourage coups and militarisation, and wreck the environment. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, a palm-fringed tropical island, is now a test case for oil companies and the world: will it be plundered and overwhelmed by the changes about to happen? Or could it, as many of the world's top economic and social advisers hope, avoid the paradox of plenty, become the only small, undeveloped country ever to have found oil in large quantities, shared the benefits equitably and guaranteed future generations sustainable development? </p> <p>To see what can happen when oil comes to a small nation, head to Malabo, the capital of only slightly larger Equatorial Guinea, which lies 300 miles to the north-east of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, close to Nigeria. Ten years ago, ExxonMobil found vast quantities of oil and gas in its waters, just as it has now done in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. Tiny Equatorial Guinea, split between the island of Santa Isabella - the former Spanish colony of Fernando Po - and a strip of mainland west Africa, now produces 440,000 barrels of oil a day, almost half the yield of Nigeria; within five years it will probably be Africa's second largest oil and gas producer, and one of America's largest providers. </p> <p>On one level, oil has been good for Equatorial Guinea. ExxonMobil, US oil giant Marathon and others have invested more than $3bn in a country of about 500,000 people. The average income is said to have grown to $5,000 a head from less than $500, the economy is growing by 65% a year - faster than anywhere else in the world - and the country has paid off its crippling $200m international debt. According to the International Monetary Fund, its income from oil and gas is about $1bn a year, but this is based on 1992 oil prices and output. It's more likely that Equatorial Guinea is currently earning $3bn a year from oil. </p> <p>This kind of wealth makes a little known, globally insignificant nation a target for every kind of investor, entrepreneur, political opportunist and freebooter. Oil has brought attempted coups, massive corruption, xenophobia and paranoia. There have been frequent coup attempts in Equatorial Guinea, but the most serious was last March, when 25 men, including South Africans and Germans, were arrested in Malabo for allegedly plotting to overthrow the president. The next day, a further 70 men, including Old Etonian Simon Mann, were arrested on a plane at Harare airport in Zimbabwe, en route, it was claimed, to Equatorial Guinea from South Africa. The men said they were going to act as guards for a mining company in the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p> <p>The government's theory, pieced together from prisoner statements, is that the two groups were going to meet in Malabo, kill the president and secure the city to allow an exiled Equatorial Guinean living in Spain to be installed as president. To add to the intrigue, the Spanish government and US officials are said to have known of the plot in advance. Sir Mark Thatcher has been detained in Cape Town pending another court hearing into whether he invested money in the coup attempt. Meanwhile, the men held in Zimbabwe have been tried for arms offences and been given sentences ranging from one to seven years. The trial of those arrested in Malabo is expected to re-open on Monday. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea was a Spanish colony until 1968. After independence, a Marxist government held power until 1979 when Teodoro Obiang Nguema overthrew his uncle in a coup. Obiang has retained absolute power since presiding over his country's spectacular access to wealth. He has a reputation for a brutal way with political opponents, and from the evidence of a visit, he has done nothing to share out the oil riches fairly. </p> <p>Oil is changing Malabo fast. A new dual carriageway leads from a new airport into the capital, where new hotels are being built and glass-walled office blocks are springing up. But the city centre is quiet, edgy and almost empty. Within an hour of arrival in this strange little country without bookshops or tourists, two spies eavesdropped our conversation in a hotel, we were followed in the street by the army, special police and national police, informed on by a man standing at a corner, stopped at gunpoint, asked for our papers, and had a film confiscated. </p> <p>\"Who are you? Why are you here? Where is your permission? Nobody takes pictures here,\" shouted the nervous kid in fatigues waving his gun. </p> <p>The head of the UN development programme in Equatorial Guinea, Bacar Abdouroihamane, warned us, \"Beware, this place, it's dangerous. It is very extreme, a place of nightmares and miracles. Two years ago they only had a few hundred cars, no airport, nothing. Now there are some very full bank accounts. They have 50 ministers and 25 presidential advisers. They have been kept in deep poverty for 200 years. Now oil comes, they see light at the end of the tunnel. But the companies do not care what happens. Equatorial Guinea has the worst mosquitoes and malaria in the world, there is appalling poverty and many shadow places that no one wants you to see.\" </p> <p>That evening, sitting in the eerie orange light of \"the eternal flame\" - the gas-flaring from Marathon Oil's giant $1.8bn methane works being constructed outside Malabo - we met Madame Lucie Bourthemieux, a Paris-based Cameroonian lawyer acting as an adviser to the minister of justice. Mme Lucie was keen to defend the regime. \"There is a deep distrust of foreign powers here,\" she said. \"The president has a hatred of, almost an allergy to, the west, especially to Spain, which treated the country like dirt as a colony. It was left at independence with nothing, and run by a Marxist dictator until he took over. Democracy is young here. It may not actually be the most suitable method of politics. The president says that God wants him to build the country. He is sincere, very Catholic. He knows what poverty is, what it is to have no light or water.\" </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea, she said, had been ripped off by US oil companies from the moment oil was discovered. \"The companies struck a deal that left it with just 15% of the oil revenues. The president could do nothing. They took the lion's share. In front of the lion, what can the rabbit do? The lawyers involved in signing the first contracts were supposed to advise the country, but were working for the Americans. Today, if America doesn't like a president, it takes him out.\" The second problem, she said, was that oil had made Equatorial Guinea strategically important. \"It's now in the interests of many countries to try to destabilise us. We have no friends. Until oil came, no one was interested in us. Now everyone wants to steal our wealth.\" Equatorial Guinea's enemies, she said, were waging an intense propaganda war, spreading rumours and libels about the president. </p> <p>Over the next three days, Mme Lucie interrogated us regularly and had Guardian articles about the president sent to her from Paris. She objected strongly to reports from watchdog groups in Europe and the US that Obiang had profited handsomely from oil at the expense of human rights and the poor, and was furious that a political exile had been allowed to say that the president was \"a cannibal\" who \"eats human testicles\". \"How can the Guardian write that? It is so demeaning and insulting to an African head of state. You could never ever say that about Mr Blair,\" she thundered. </p> <p>\"This is a good place. You are welcome to talk to people,\" she said. But Malabo is almost the only city in Africa where no one, not even the children, want to talk and where people look around in fear or just walk away when you speak to them. By chance, we met Charles, a young man who was as anxious to show us Malabo as he was to leave it. </p> <p>We started the reality tour on the new motorway. \"The president and his family own all the land on either side for miles. That enormous house is the president's wife's hotel ... that's his brother-in-law's house ... this is his third son's ... this is the nephew's ... that is the house of his first wife,\" he said. Indeed, every new building of any size seemed to belong to the president or his family. </p> <p>All the US companies - ExxonMobil, Marathon, Halliburton, Chevron, Total - had refused to meet or talk to us, but we got to within 300 yards of some of their huge complexes, all built on more land owned by the president. Here we were stopped by armed guards demanding bribes. We turned back, past the golf course hacked out of virgin forest also owned by the president; the prefab city built by multinational Bechtel for the 4,000 Filipino construction workers shipped in to build Marathon's plant; the village flattened without compensation to make way for the companies; and the fortified ExxonMobil compound with its guardhouses, tennis courts, cinemas and canteens where even the tomatoes are flown in from America. </p> <p>\"The president and his family own everything. They earn many millions a year from the land he rents to the oil companies. The money goes straight out of the country. It's paid in dollars straight into secret accounts,\" said Charles. </p> <p>\"This is what oil brings,\" he continued as we drove past rows of new $1m houses built for oil executives, and huge houses bristling with satellite and radio masts lived in by ministers, government advisers and security chiefs. We headed up Chester E Norris Jnr avenue, an American-style suburb named after a US ambassador who was pulled out of Malabo in 1988. Less wealthy expats live here with their barbecues and basketball nets behind high fences. </p> <p>\"Now see how Equatorial Guineans live,\" said Charles. He headed to Newbuildings, an ocean of wooden shacks where about 30,000 people live in some of Africa's worst slums. There were six foot-high rubbish mountains, ponds of standing water infested with mosquitoes, broken drains and water pipes. \"Most people live without electricity. There is no sanitation. People are living in rubbish dumps. Everything is fucked here. We were promised a better world with oil, but we have nothing and now we live only in fear,\" said Charles. \"They have done nothing for health or for schools. The president and his family have all the money, the opportunities and the power. All power leads to him. He makes all the decisions. One family only lives well here.\" </p> <p>We continued the tour of downtown Malabo. \"This is where the prostitutes from Cameroon and Gambia have come to live. Oil has brought many bad people, bandits. This area was burned down twice this year ... People say that the ministers and the oilworkers brought Aids. There are many bars in the city for expats to pick up girls. Before, we were poor. Now, we are poor and raped,\" said Charles. \"Duck your head now. We must be careful no one sees you here .. People are afraid to talk. All we see now is more police and army. Petrol has brought only problems. Since it came, rents have more than doubled. All prices have risen.\" As he spoke, Obiang's two personal military helicopters flew overhead towards the airport. </p> <p>We asked to see the hospital, which was clean, orderly, staffed mostly by Cuban doctors. The hospital had a new wing and the babies slept under mosquito nets stamped with the ExxonMobil logo. Very quickly staff asked us to leave. That evening, however, we went back with 15-year-old Rico, whom we'd met in the street. He needed to have a festering wound on his thigh treated. We took him to the new wing where he was assessed by a doctor, treated and given antibiotics in less than 30 minutes for $3. </p> <p>\"But my family has nothing,\" said Rico, leading us to his house, a six foot-square wooden shed which he shared with his mother, baby sister and brother. None of the families in the large compound wanted to talk or have their picture taken. That evening a policeman followed us back to our hotel, sat down beside us and pointedly fiddled with his gun. </p> <p>For Anglo-Cameroonian businessman Patrick, the country is a nightmare place to work. \"Oil has made Equatorial Guinea a family business with 500,000 employees. Every business here must release a percentage of the company or pay a bribe, or both, to the president or one of his family. That generates huge amounts of dosh. It all goes straight offshore. You can do nothing without presidential support. The president has 17 children and the oldest drives a red Ferrari. The government demands that companies who come here build the roads or whatever. The country has been badly treated by everyone for years, so it's payback time now.\" He adds that 20 years ago Equatorial Guinea was so poor that it offered itself to neighbouring Cameroon for $1m. Cameroon refused. </p> <p>Political opposition has been muted and depressed since the recent elections overwhelmingly returned the government. There is notionally an opposition party, but Pio-Miguel Obama, general secretary of the socialist CPDS party, didn't want to be seen with us in public and said that, like many of his party, he had been in prison and tortured. </p> <p>\"This country is very rich now, but everything is concentrated to benefit the power of the president. No one knows how much oil money is coming in, not even the finance minister. It is not in the budget. The oil money goes to the president's accounts in Europe and the US. ExxonMobil is accused in the US of having paid $400m into his private account, but the company gives no information. </p> <p>\"They said that oil would bring jobs, but it's impossible to get a job with the companies. They employ only a few hundred people - the rest are temporary workers from the Philippines. The companies provide only a few mattresses, nets and beds for the hospital. Meanwhile, there is a huge network of spies who are paid to inform on people. Everyone here is a policeman.\" </p> <p>Two days later, having been refused interviews by the ministers of information, justice, security and tourism, we tried to leave but were dragged back from the airport departure lounge by a flustered Mme Lucie. \"You must not go,\" she implored us. \"The president knows you are here. He has ordered his personal political adviser, the man whom he is closest to, and the minister of justice, to meet you. It would be very unwise to leave.\" </p> <p>Their Excellencies Miguel Oyono Ndong Mifuno and Dr Ruben Maye Nsue were both angry. Both were relations of the president. Obiang's right-hand man dripped with gold, while Dr Nsue, the justice minister, educated in France, Spain and Geneva, was young, smart and charming. \"Why are you here?\" demanded Mifuno. \"Are you here to destabilise the country? Our security investigations say that you are engaged in an operation to discredit the country. Who is behind this? We have our ideas. You must apologise for your past mistakes.\" </p> <p>He added, more calmly: \"Oil here is a political resource. When we had none, no one was interested in us. Now everyone comes to take advantage of us. Our enemies say that the oil money goes only to the president. That is vulgar talk. What I know is that people here - everyone - has money or the facility to build his own house, or look for work. There are no secret or private accounts. Everything is accountable.\" </p> <p>He said that oil has brought global companies flocking to Malabo. \"They want to steal our wealth. They demand a percentage share of the oil. We say no. They want to build an airport the size of Frankfurt, we say no. They say that they want to make us a gift of sanitation and water, but it is not a gift. They want to build a new port, but they demand $200m to do the feasibility studies, so we say no ... We do not want five-star hotels. We only want development that is suitable for our people. I know the president well. He wants the best for his people. Soon Malabo 2 [a new administrative capital] will be built. Ten thousand houses will be built for the people.\" </p> <p>Q: Will they be given to poor people? </p> <p>A: No, they must buy them. </p> <p>Q: How? </p> <p>A: Everyone has money. </p> <p>Q: How much does the country earn from oil? </p> <p>A: You should ask the IMF. </p> <p>Q: What is your annual budget? </p> <p>A: [He telephones the minister of finance before answering.] $1bn. </p> <p>Q: How much is spent on health and education? </p> <p>A: 40% of the budget - $400m a year. </p> <p>Q: How much does the president and his family take from oil. What about his mansions in America? </p> <p>A: That is not an issue. </p> <p>But it is. The next day, the Washington Post reported that Riggs Bank in New York had agreed to pay $25m in fines for what US regulators called a \"wilful, systemic\" violation of anti-money-laundering laws. Regulators said the bank failed to report \"clearly suspicious transactions\", particularly ones connected to the embassy of Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>In Malabo, it was President Obiang's 62nd birthday. The country's elite, about 100 people, went by Mercedes, Toyota and Buick to the cathedral. Obiang arrived last in a 12-car convoy of police and army vehicles from his palace 500 yards away. Six bodyguards ran alongside it holding handguns. No one else in Malabo was allowed within 300 yards. </p> <p>\"When people smell oil, they delude themselves. They go mad,\" said Patrick as we said goodbye. </p> <p>Oil financed 30 years of civil war in Angola. At least $30bn of oil money has been squandered or stolen in Nigeria and the Niger delta region, where it is found, is close to anarchy. In Chad, Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, oil money has led directly to governmental corruption, electoral fraud, environmental destruction, financial mismanagement and human rights abuses. Can tiny S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe do any better? </p> <p>The capital, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 city, has the pace and feel of a Caribbean island 30 years ago. Just three years ago it was neglected and broke. There were about 50 cars on the whole island and just one flight a week to the capital. The budget for the country was $25m a year - a quarter of the turnover of a London supermarket - and anyone who wanted to see the president could walk into the down-at-heel palace. Aid made up 80% of the country's income, it owed $300m and its economy was dictated by harsh IMF structural adjustment programmes. </p> <p>Not much has changed. The palace now has three guards, but chickens run around its grounds. The one TV channel regularly closes down because it cannot get spare parts. The power goes off most nights, there is no daily newspaper and goats walk the streets. The only token of the global economy is a Visa cash machine. However, there are many more cars, daily flights to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 from Europe - and a lot of smart lawyers, businessmen and soldiers in town. </p> <p>\"Oil will change everything very soon,\" says Colonel Eugene Michael Mensch, president of Consulting Africa Ltd, a recently retired US marine sent to conduct seminars on military/civilian relations with the government. He is part of an advance guard of Americans now regularly in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 to prepare it for the changes that oil and America demand. </p> <p>America's unstated but emerging policy is to turn S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 into a strategic regional base to protect its growing oil interests in the Gulf of Guinea. The region has an estimated 50bn barrels of oil reserves, and within 10 years is expected to provide 25% of US oil, more even than the Middle East. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is ideal. Unlike Equatorial Guinea, which the US State Department has labelled \"ruthless\" for its torture and incarceration of the opposition, it has a pro-west president, few people, a large Voice of America radio station and no anti-Americanism. </p> <p>To underline S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's new strategic importance, a full US military exercise was staged in its waters during the summer. Washington is paying $900m for feasibility studies on a new airport able to take the largest military aircraft, as well as a deep sea port large enough for its warships. Under the terms of the contract, both will have to be built by American companies. </p> <p>The US has other plans for S\u00e3o Tome. \"They've got 350 people in the army and no coastal defences. They don't know what is going on, or who is coming in, but oil money will bring drugs and illegal immigration. They're not at the point where they know if they need an air force. If you take the cynical view, you would say that the US is in it for the money, but we want to help them, too. They need to be ready,\" says the US military attach\u00e9 in Gabon. There are others wanting a stake in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, too. Brazil, France, South Africa, Nigeria, Portugal and Angola have all recently offered to \"help\" train and bankroll its army, police and coastguards. </p> <p>The international community was not there to lend a hand, however, when S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 made its most crucial decision: in 1997, an unknown, Houston-based Nigerian company called ERHC, which had never drilled a barrel of oil, offered just $5m for - and got - exclusive exploration rights to all S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's waters. It was described as one of the best - or worst - deals in history, and the World Bank declared it unfair. But no money was paid and the deal looked set to fall apart until Sir Emeka Offor, a Nigerian businessman closely associated with the late Nigerian dictator Sami Abacha - who stole an estimated $4bn when in power - bought ERHC, renamed it Chrome, brought in ExxonMobil, involved the Nigerian government and proposed a new agreement in return for lucrative concession rights. When Exxon struck oil, Chrome/ERHC became worth about $600m overnight. Nigeria then disputed S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's territorial limits. Fearing it would lose everything, desperate for cash, the then president caved in and agreed a 60:40 split in Nigeria's favour. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Chrome/ERHC and Exxon also negotiated preferential rights. By the time the first licences were bid for last November, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had effectively given away much of its oil-rich territory, handed a barely existent Nigerian company almost 20% of what was left, and given up most of its rights to down payments. However, November 23 2003 was still the greatest day in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's uneventful history. Twenty companies bid a combined $506m for seven exploration blocks, leading the government to expect more than $200m in signature payments. So far, only one contract has been awarded, to ChevronTexaco. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans are now realising that they will see next to no money for many years. The first boreholes will be drilled next year, but the companies say oil will not flow until 2011. In another controversial deal, the companies negotiated the right to recoup their investments first, receiving 80% of all the oil money for the first five years of production. In other words, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 stands to make only 20% of a 40% share (8%) between 2011 and 2017. </p> <p>No one, least of all Fradique de Menezes, the half-Portuguese cocoa trader elected president in 2001, doubts that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 will one day become rich. Fradique, as he is known everywhere, says that the country will get at least $500m a year from oil, more than 10 times its present annual income. But he, too, is accused of lining his pockets. On taking power, he was found to have secretly accepted $100,000 from EHRC/Chrome's chairman. Both parties said it was a legitimate election contribution. </p> <p>Fradique has had a torrid year. Last June he was flown to Washington to sit at President Bush's right hand with other African oil state leaders. Shortly after, while in Nigeria, he was ousted in a short bloodless coup by a small army group, backed by the \"Buffalo boys\" - S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an mercenaries who fought with the apartheid regime in South Africa. Eventually Nigeria negotiated a deal whereby the organisers of the coup agreed to hand back the islands on the promise of better conditions for the army. Oil may not have been the prime reason for the coup, but no one doubts it was in the background. </p> <p>\"I am optimistic but very afraid,\" says Chr\u00e9tien Lehombre, of the UN development programme that is trying to help S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 prepare for oil. According to a new UN report, unless the country prepares rapidly, it is certain to suffer \"resource curse\". This is a feature of all poor countries that depend for their income largely on one resource - be it diamonds, gold, timber, oil or gas, cacao or copper. </p> <p>Seven things usually happen when oil comes to a poor country, says the report. Prices rise; the government loses interest in everything else; officials become corrupt; multinational companies reward individuals via secret accounts; there is increased military spending; democracy is undermined; and prestige white elephant projects get built. </p> <p>\"Spending the money wisely is the biggest challenge S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 will ever face,\" says Lehombre. \"So many mistakes have been made already in the initial contracts.\" In some ways, says Lehombre, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is enlightened. Last year the government hired experts from Alaska to advise on how to deal with windfall oil money and a UN special adviser has been working with young economists at Columbia university to draw up a model oil law, which, if passed, will ensure that neither government nor president can squander or steal the oil money. \"The broad principles have been agreed by parliament,\" says Lehombre. </p> <p>According to others who have seen the draft law, it also states that the government can increase annual spending by only 20% a year, with the amount it takes from the oil fund dropping 2% a year until, after 10 years, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 must live on the interest alone - expected to be at least $50m a year. One anomaly is that Principe, with only 5,000 people, is to get 10% of the money, the equivalent of an English village having several billion pounds in the bank and earning at least $5m a year. </p> <p>The fear is that President de Menezes will refuse to sign up. Last year, parliament tried to change the constitution to reduce his powers. He dismissed parliament. \"The law will limit the risks, and the amount that can be injected into the economy, but then look at all the aid that has come to the country in the past 20 years. Officially, it was $30-35m a year. Where did that go? That's the reality check,\" says Lehombre. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of rural S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans barely believe there is life beyond the plantations. The island was a Portuguese colony until 1975 and the prime source of income has always been cocoa. \"I just don't know if oil will bring a better life than this,\" says Ricardo Toakares, who lives in the crumbling, colonnaded grandeur of the old Mille Flores cocoa estate. More than 100 families live in its marble-floored rooms, stables, workshops and kitchens. There are fires on the balconies, dogs on the verandas and what once must have been lawns are covered in washing. </p> <p>\"We have very little money. We live on bananas and cocoa, and sell fruit to the town. There's not enough food, we need to repair the school and we need houses and work. The malaria here is terrible. A doctor comes every Tuesday but we have no drugs. It all depends on the government. Maybe things will change. After all, we do not need very much, just decent jobs and a better standard of life. It could be wonderful here. But we have a saying: 'The president drinks with a cup, the rich with a spoon and the poor with a fork.'\" </p> <p>The S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 elite already has grand ideas. \"I see S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 as a Singapore or a Hong Kong,\" says businessman Tony Aguire, who chairs the committee set up to manage the new airport and port studies. \"We see it setting up a free trade zone, becoming a transit and storage place for the region, with shops, hotels, duty-free zones for oilworkers, providing logistical support for the oil companies, a private healthcare centre for rich people in the region ...\" </p> <p>Carlos Tiny, a former presidential candidate, gives his verdict: \"It will be heaven, hell or purgatory, depending on the choices made.\"</p>",
  "When the first visitors come to Tate Modern to see the latest installation in the Turbine Hall on Tuesday, there will be nothing to see. Instead of filling the space with a huge cast sculpture, or the flicker of neon lights, Bruce Nauman has elected to infuse it with the invisible: with sound. <p>The previous two Turbine Hall Unilever commissions, Anish Kapoor's Marsyas and Olafur Eliasson's Weather Project, upped the ante in terms of just how big, dramatic and overwhelming the art in that space could be. </p> <p>For many, Eliasson's piece will be unforgettable for its curious effects on its audience, as visitors were drawn to congegrate, even meditate, beneath that immense sodium globe at the east end of the hall. </p> <p>Emma Dexter, the Tate's curator in charge of the new installation, is convinced Nauman's piece will not disappoint by comparison. \"It may be just as overpowering and spectacular as some of the previous Unilever commissions,\" she said, talking about the effects Nauman's works can have on the spectator's sense of his or her body, and the engaging, emotional nature of the forthcoming piece - though she refused to be drawn on specifics in advance of the project's unveiling. </p> <p>Nor is the work likely to be comforting. Reviewing the last major showing of Nauman's work in this country, at the Hayward Gallery in London in 1998, the Guardian art critic Adrian Searle described his oeuvre as an \"art that hectors and rants and raves, an art that intimidates. Instead of exaltation, we're more likely to experience a panic attack.\" </p> <p>Enticing Nauman to make a work for the Turbine Hall was a coup for the Tate. He is a notably unbiddable artist (\"he is not known for playing to the gallery or being crowd pleasing,\" says Dexter). He rarely takes on commissions, preferring to work in the relative isolation of his New Mexico ranch. </p> <p>He has given only a handful of interviews over his 40-year career, breaking his silence recently to talk to Tate Etc magazine about the installation. </p> <p>So what can we expect on Tuesday? There will be a series of speakers mounted on the side walls of the hall in pairs, starting at the top of the west entrance ramp and drawing visitors down into the body of the hall. </p> <p><b> Collage</b><br> </p> <p> \"It's as if when you walk through the space, you come through wave after wave of different texts ... you walk through these bands of sound as you go down the ramp and into the space,\" said Nauman. The texts will be drawn from previous works: \"I wanted to use spoken text I had recorded over the past 30 or 40 years and make a kind of collage.\" </p> <p>The sound will operate on one level as a sculptural material, it is hinted, such that its relationship with the volume of the space will be explored. It is likely that Nauman will also have exploited the aural, musical qualities of the texts. And one might conjecture that the overall deployment of the various sounds in relation to one another will bear comparison to a musical composition. </p> <p>Nauman was born in 1941, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He studied maths, physics, art, music and philosophy in Wisconsin, then art at the University of California. </p> <p>In a 1987 interview, Nauman said of his working methods: \"I remember at one point thinking that some day I would figure out how you do this, how you do art - like 'What's the procedure, here, folks?' And then it wouldn't be such a struggle any more. Later, I realised it was ... always going to be a struggle, I realised I would never have a specific process. I would have to reinvent it, over and over again. </p> <p>\"That was really depressing ... On the other hand, that's what's interesting about making art, and why it's worth doing: it's never going to be the same, there is no method.\" </p> <p>This refusal to tie himself to a straightforward set of procedures, his heuristic approach and constant self-reinvention, are qualities that set him apart. Nauman has worked in pretty much every medium available to him. He has used performance, neon, video, language, casts, sound. He has even made sculpture from flour. </p> <p>He connects to an intellectual tradition that includes Samuel Beckett, Vladimir Nabokov and Ludwig Wittgenstein (especially in the ways that he has investigated the properties of language). He has named Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray and Jasper Johns as influences. </p> <p>He has also looked to the performing arts, to the music of American minimalists Steve Reich and Philip Glass, and dancers and choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Meredith Monk. </p> <p>In turn, his influence has been wide. He was among the first to exploit the possibilities of video in the 1970s, spawning a thousand imitators. Dexter says that in his use of language in titles and his propensity to making casts of objects, Damien Hirst owes Nauman a debt. </p> <p>Searle's assessment is: \"More and more, I think Nauman is a wonderfully devious and complex artist, and his attitude has been massively influential, especially for younger artists. </p> <p>\"His insistence on using the things about him, the near-at-hand, even his frustrated pacing about, drinking coffee and wondering what on earth to do next; or filming his cat chasing the mice around his studio at night using an infrared camera, is genuinely creative. </p> <p>\"He is incredibly rigorous. Poetry and meaning are where you find them. Nauman shows us you don't have to search out the exotic. In fact, its often better if you don't.\" </p> <p>According to Dexter: \"A lot of artists of his generation or of that immediately before made very formal works, or pieces that interrogated structuralism, or the nature of photography, or what language is - in other words, they worked on a very cerebral level. </p> <p>\"Nauman does work on a cerebral level but he often brings things back to a very mundane, human level - looking at bodily functions, say, or love. Subjects that people don't necessarily regard as very fashionable any more. </p> <p>\"Nauman has a profound message about our existence - albeit one that you might glimpse, and would then slip away.\" </p> <p><b> Get Out Of My Mind, Get Out Of This Room (1968)</b> </p> <p>Nauman's stated prototype for his Turbine Hall installation. The visitor stands in a space while voices are heard from speakers at the sides of the room. Nauman: \"That piece is still amazingly powerful to me. And it's really a frightening piece.\" </p> <p><b> Clown Torture (1987)</b> </p> <p>One of a series of three \"clown torture\" videos. Nauman: \"Because clowns are abstract in some sense, they become very disconcerting.\" </p> <p><b> Violent Incident (1986)</b> </p> <p>A bank of 12 video monitors in three rows is used to tell the story of two characters at dinner. Nauman: \"The images are aggressive, the language is abusive.\" </p> <p><b> Anthro/Socio (1992)</b> </p> <p>A close-up face is projected on to three walls of a room and six video monitors. It screams: \"Feed me, eat me, anthropology ... Help me hurt me, sociology ... feed me, help me, eat me, hurt me.\" </p> <p>Nauman, on the Tate installation: \"I really want to use Rinde Eckert singing from Anthro/Socio, but that's such an intense tape that I have to be careful it doesn't take over the situation.\" </p> <p> Nauman quotes from 1987 interview with Joan Simon, reprinted in Please Pay Attention Please: Bruce Nauman's Words, edited by Janet Kraynak; and from Nauman's interview with Robert Storr for Tate Etc magazine.</p>",
  "Long before you arrive in Bundaberg the smell of the town has already hit: the sickly, sugary odour of the cane harvest season in the warm subtropical night. <p>It was sugar that built this town of 45,000 people, sprawling on the coastal floodplains of the Burnett river in central Queensland. The industry and related businesses are worth A$1bn (\u00a3409m) to the local economy - nearly a quarter of the whole - and one in 12 workers is employed in the industry. But sugar is in decline, and Bundaberg is feeling the pinch. </p> <p>It's a tough town with little to attract the casual visitor, but it holds a key position in the Australian election battle, which is why politicians have been beating a path here. </p> <p>Bundaberg is the focal point of Hinkler constituency, and Hinkler is the 12th most marginal government seat in the country. </p> <p>And with the Labor opposition 12 seats short of a majority in the federal parliament, a win here would give Labor every chance of taking the country. It is Australia's tipping point. </p> <p>Mark Latham held the first public meeting of his campaign here, and his deputy, Jenny Macklin, stopped by on Monday for a policy launch. The deputy prime minister and National party leader, John Anderson, has paid regular visits to shore up support. </p> <p>But with unemployment running at twice the national average, hardship and apathy define attitudes. </p> <p>Mark Slater, 42, and his partner, Pam Kniese, 39, are exactly the sort of people that both sides in the campaign are playing for. </p> <p>They supported the anti-immigration stance of Pauline Hanson, and represent the section of the public the government has tried hardest to woo. But Mr Slater says he would not turn up at the polls were it not for Australia's compulsory voting laws. \"They've done nothing to win me over,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who's in power, they'll only do what they want.\" </p> <p>Even so, John Howard's subsidies for private education and healthcare is a particular bugbear. \"The private [sector] is more like a privilege: it's a luxury item,\" says Ms Kniese. \"That money shouldn't come from the taxpayer.\" </p> <p>There are not many immigrants in Bundaberg - just 3% of people speak English as a second language, compared with 16% nationwide - but the issue remains crucial to voters. </p> <p>And while working-class Labor supporters have been disaffected by the party's perceived soft line, the government's hard line has pushed middle-class Liberal voters into the opposition's arms. </p> <p>Mr Howard's nightmares are filled with people like Sophia McLean, whose six-month-old son Angus goes to the same childcare group as three-year-old Leigh Slater. A teacher and lifelong Liberal supporter who grew up a few blocks from Mr Howard in Sydney, she and her husband Craig are planning to support Labor for the first time today. </p> <p>\"What we're doing is horrific,\" she says, referring to the government's treatment of asylum seekers. \"We have a right to decide who should come here but we shouldn't have them stuck in detention centres.\" </p> <p>She thinks that Mr Howard wins on personal credibility but prefers Labor policies. Like many Australians, she is still making up her mind whether to stick with a familiar government which has lost her faith, or give a chance to an opposition she likes but does not yet trust. </p> <p>\"I'm hoping Labor will win, but I'm a little worried,\" she says. \"We need a little bit of change but not a huge swingaround.\"</p>",

  "The Republican and Democratic parties are massing armies of lawyers to fight for every vote in case next month's US election becomes a repeat of the 2000 debacle in Florida. <p>The court cases have already started more than three weeks before polling day. The Democrats have taken Florida's Republican secretary of state, Glenda Hood, to court twice this week, accusing her of putting up obstacles to first-time voters. </p> <p>One issue at stake is a tiny box on the Florida registration form which the potential voter is supposed to tick to confirm that he or she is a US citizen. Democrats say the box is redundant as the voter is also required to sign a statement stating US citizenship. But Ms Hood has told election officials to reject forms on which the box is not ticked. </p> <p>She was also taken to court yesterday for restricting provisional voting - in which the voter's registration has to be confirmed after the ballot - to the elector's home district. </p> <p>These are the opening skirmishes in what is likely to be a fierce and prolonged legal battle that will rumble on until the election on November and beyond if the results are close. </p> <p>\"It is quite possible we will not know the result of this election on November 3,\" said Robert Boorstin, a former aide to Bill Clinton and a political analyst at the pro-Democratic Centre for American Progress. </p> <p>This week, the Democrats announced the formation of a legal task force ready for rapid deployment to swing states where the vote may be contested. As part of its 2004 Voter Protection Programme, the task force has a contact list of thousands of volunteer lawyers and a coordinator in each of the 23 states where the result may be close. The Republicans have assembled a similar army, targeting 30,000 voter precincts in 17 states. </p> <p>Both sides are setting up legal command centres and have prepared paperwork so they can mount rapid challenges to polling improprieties. In general terms, the Democratic pre-election legal effort is aimed at maximising turnout, particularly among black voters and immigrants. Republican lawyers focus more on combating suspected voter fraud, and insisting that the rules are upheld. </p> <p>This has frequently led to charges that the Republicans and the state governments they control are trying to suppress the minority vote. The Florida police have toured poor neighbourhoods, checking identity documents, in what Democrats say is an attempt to intimidate would-be voters. </p> <p>The arguments have raised ghosts of the 2000 vote, in which a disproportionate number of black Floridian voters were disqualified over technicalities, and some said they were discouraged by the presence of police checkpoints near polling stations. </p> <p>One of the stranger episodes of the past month was an attempt by Ohio's Republican secretary of state, Kenneth Blackwell, to disqualify thousands of registration forms in Democratic districts of Cleveland because they were not printed on thick enough card. He was forced to withdraw the ruling amid public uproar. </p> <p>Harold Meyerson, a liberal columnist, wrote in the Washington Post: \"While US troops are fighting and dying to bring the vote to Samarra [in Iraq], their families may be struggling to hang on to the franchise here at home. </p> <p>\"And even as those soldiers are strapping on their body armour to bring the vote to Sadr City, back home - in Florida, Ohio, New Mexico and other battleground states - Republican election officials are working to reduce the number of black and Latino voters.\" </p> <p>The Republicans have insisted they are concerned only with fraud and are just as keen as the Democrats to promote a high turnout. \"We will fight any effort to suppress votes,\" JC Watts, a black Republican congressman from Oklahoma told the Cox news agency. </p> <p>On election day, legal attention is likely to shift to voting methods. Florida has a new computer system which, critics say, can easily be hacked into. </p> <p>Two-thirds of Ohio voters, meanwhile, will use the punch-card ballots that caused trouble in Florida four years ago. If the presidency rests on a close vote there, both sides could once again be quarrelling over \"hanging\" and \"pregnant\" chads.</p>",
  "<p>Spain's national football coach apologised yesterday for any offence caused by his reference to Thierry Henry as a \"black shit\" but his Arsenal team-mate Robert Pires insisted Luis Aragon\u00e9s should face prosecution for his comments. </p> <p>Aragon\u00e9s claimed not to be a racist despite being caught on camera trying to motivate Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes with the harangue, \"tell that negro de mierda [black shit] you're better than him\", in reference to the Spaniard's Arsenal strike partner. </p> <p>His protest has cut little ice within the France squad, however, and Pires has demanded action. \"He shouldn't be allowed to get away with it; he should be cornered on this,\" Pires said. \"He should be sued for racial aggression. </p> <p>\"We should not be nice to him,\" he went on. \"If this is a joke, it's a weird one.\" </p> <p>Aragon\u00e9s said last night: \"In the first place I want to clarify that I never intended to offend anyone, and for that reason I have a very easy conscience. </p> <p>\"Second, what I said can only be understood in the context of the team and a training session, in which I am obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. </p> <p>\"As part of that job, I use colloquial language, with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. </p> <p>\"Finally, and understanding the importance that the post of national coach has, I can only apologise to the people who may have been offended, reiterating that it was never my intention to belittle anyone because, among other things, I would be doing as much to many of my friends.\" </p> <p>While Aragon\u00e9s's tirade has caused outrage in France and England, the Spanish have rallied around the coach. </p> <p>The president of the Spanish Football Federation, Angel Mar\u00eda Villar insisted: \"Luis Aragon\u00e9s is no racist. He is a great professional and it is absurd to think otherwise. He has coached many foreign and coloured players and has always been correct and respectful. </p> <p>The sports minister Jaime Lissavietzky agreed with Villar that the words had been taken out of context, although he conceded that his choice of words was \"unfortunate\". </p> <p>Players and managers from all over Spain have lent their support, although there has been no response yet from Samuel Eto'o, the Cameroonian striker who played under Aragon\u00e9s at Mallorca and who calls the 66-year-old \"grandad\". </p> <p>\"You lot [the press] have to be careful not to blow things out of proportion,\" said the Spain defender M\u00edchel Salgado. \"This was a joke that should have stayed on the training pitch and if things like this happen we're going to end up training behind closed doors.\" </p> <p>The Spanish media have also supported Aragon\u00e9s, the reaction mainly one of bemused surprise. The sports daily Marca interpreted Aragon\u00e9s's words as merely an example of the coach's peculiar style, insisting there was \"nothing racist about it\".</p>",
  "Sound ideology translated into well-thought-out policy energetically and efficiently carried through. The essentials of good government. <p>What will end Labour's rule? Not, I think, some major mistake in policy, or failure to accomplish; but a shift in perception. It will all come down to the volume of hints and allegations, smears and tittle-tattle that swills around the feet of politicians long in office.</p> <p>And so what was memorable about the Labour party conference? It should have been a celebration of undoubted achievement: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A stable economy bringing jobs and security; massive investment in the health service with real results</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Class sizes down, exam results improved and a courageous attempt to deal with the problem of funding an ever increasing growth in university education;</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Financial support for the poorest in society and a belated but dynamic attempt to deal with the shortage of affordable housing; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Low interest rates fuelling steady economic growth coupled with low inflation (remember inflation?); </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The minimum wage, which according to Conservatives would bring the economy to its knees, now taken for granted.</p> <p>Labour will be re-elected. How could they fail? Well, just look at the media coverage. The serious papers and the television concentrated on the wars: the one between the neighbours from hell in Downing Street; and to a lesser extent, the one in Iraq. </p> <p>This is remarkable. It matters little to anyone. Yet here we are, treated to the secret ravings of one faction or the other and the endless divination of the entrails by pundits bored by an endless diet of successful government.</p> <p>Don't mention the other war. They tried not to. Tony Blair's personal achilles heel. Without being an apologist for him, I would say he believed he was saving the western world and needed to carry the country with him. All those bothersome caveats in intelligence reports just got in the way. He is now unloved among Labour supporters but still acceptable to middle-ground voters.</p> <p>Eye-catching new policies were missing. But no one should be misled: this has been a competent government.</p> <p><b>Howard and the Tories</b></p> <p>Just as I was dismayed by media coverage of Labour's conference I am cautious about the doom-laden take on the Conservatives. Ukip have already served to push both the Tories and Labour and even the Lib Dems towards Euroscepticism. But in a general election they will have little impact.</p> <p>A chastened Oliver Letwin implies but doesn't promise lower taxes, and promises continued investment in public services while asserting that super-efficiency will save squillions of pounds while not making anyone redundant. </p> <p>Why am I not convinced? Whatever move he makes, Gordon Brown will cover it, therefore the shadow Chancellor is trapped in a policy pea-souper where he can only nod and wink and tap his nose. </p> <p>The Tories will privatise to their hearts' content if elected. </p> <p>The Tory vote-winners are law and order and immigration. These are not the biggest problems facing the country today, but it was essential that Michael Howard went big on them, and he did. More expensive prisons, more expensive prisoners spending longer in them. Tories around the country drooled, as did, no doubt, Group 4 and other private security firms who will be the recipients of all this extra business. </p> <p>More police too, and - this is neat - all paid for by stopping immigration in its tracks and re-assigning its budget.</p> <p>The immigration issue is the race card in disguise and it is particularly powerful in the present climate. It borrows a spurious justification from the \"war on terror\" and has received consistent attention from the rightwing press. It has won votes for Ukip and the BNP (and ironically Plaid Cymru, which campaigns against the predations of white, elderly, middle class, English immigrants). The Conservative party has gone after its baby-eating core vote and dropped any ambivalence - about the European Union too. Forget Conservative Europhiles, they will not now rock the boat.</p> <p>I welcome this new honest dishonesty. Michael Howard's preconception of what Britain wants speaks to the rich, the xenophobic, the bigoted and the frightened. </p> <p>It is exclusive, not inclusive. Bigger prisons, smaller universities. I found his philosophy refreshingly loathsome, as loathsome as the idea of Nicholas Soames' first kiss.</p> <p>Will it work? To a degree. It will win back those on the hard right but will be sobering to those who had begun to speak of Labour as Tory lite. </p> <p>Trust. Curious this, from Michael Howard. People of my age (55) remember him, and not fondly, in the swaggering heyday of Conservative government. </p> <p>More to the point do we trust big government or big business? Paradoxically, although politicians are mistrusted (rightly, since we demand lies before we will vote for them), 18 years of Tory government turned the public against privatisation. Think who you want to administer your pension, your health care, your education and security. </p> <p>Private finance initiatives give poor value and service and are ultimately inefficient - yet the Conservatives want more of this .</p> <p><b>What I want</b></p> <p>In their third term I want Labour to grasp the nettle: no more PFI and PPP. Big government is hard to do well, but it is honest.</p> <p>From the Tories I want to see more honesty.</p>",
  "Israel's intelligence chief, Major General Aharon Zeevi-Farkash, told the Israeli cabinet today that al-Qaida were most likely to be responsible for last night's bombings in Egypt, officials said. <p>Varying reports put the death toll from the suicide and vehicle bombings at three Red Sea resorts at between 25 and 31 people. Around 150 people were injured.</p> <p>Thousands of Israeli holidaymakers were fleeing home across the border into Eilat following the attacks, the worst of which sheared outer rooms off a 10-storey wing of the luxury Hilton hotel in Taba, on the Sinai peninsula.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said that he and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, would unite to fight terror. </p> <p>Mr Sharon said he and Mr Mubarak had agreed in a telephone call to \"focus efforts and forces to fight terror\", Reuters reported.</p> <p>No credible claims of responsibility for the attacks - many of the victims of which were Israelis - had emerged. However, Israeli officials believed they bore the hallmarks of al-Qaida or its sympathisers. </p> <p>There were two explosions last night at the Hilton, which is not far south of the Israeli border. One came when a car laden with explosives - reportedly around 440lbs of them - drove into the lobby, causing a section of the building to collapse. A second was caused by a suicide attack near the hotel swimming pool, an Israeli official said.</p> <p>Later, there were two smaller blasts that killed at least four people when Toyota pickup trucks loaded with bombs struck a beach hut and campsites in Sinai.</p> <p>Hopes of finding survivors in the wreckage of the Hilton faded today, with at least four people believed to be buried underneath. Gefan Naty, an Israeli military rescuer, said: \"I don't believe anyone is still alive. We just pulled out one child who was dead.\" </p> <p>Mr Naty said a mother and daughter had fallen from the seventh floor to the first. The mother died from her injuries, but the daughter survived. He said he believed rescue workers could have saved the mother had they been allowed to get to the scene earlier. He claimed Egyptian authorities delayed their arrival.</p> <p>It was reported that rescue teams were allowed in after Mr Sharon instructed his diplomats to contact the Egyptians and expedite the crossing. Four hours after the blast, Israel's military took command of the scene.</p> <p>In a statement, Mr Sharon said he had thanked Mr Mubarak for Egypt's help in evacuating the dead and wounded. </p> <p>Today, sheets and blankets could be seen tied to the balconies of intact rooms at the Hilton, showing that guests had made frantic efforts to flee. </p> <p>There were fears the death toll could rise throughout the day, with reports that dozens of Israelis were still missing. </p> <p>The hotel attack bore similarities to one on an Israeli-owned hotel north of Mombasa, Kenya, in November 2002, which killed 15 people and was blamed on al-Qaida. In that strike also a vehicle packed with explosives rammed into the hotel. </p> <p>An Egyptian government spokesman, Magdy Rady, suggested the Sinai blasts were related to the Israeli military operation against the Palestinians in the neighbouring Gaza Strip. Eighty-four Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive in Gaza that began on September 29 in an attempt to stop militants from firing rockets into Israel. </p> <p>However, Jibril Rajoub, the security adviser to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, told al-Jazeera television that no Palestinian factions were responsible for the explosions. </p> <p>Tensions remained high in Gaza today, with reports stating that a sniper - said to be from a Palestinian town - had killed a Palestinian farm worker at a Jewish settlement. </p> <p>Most people staying at the Hilton were Israelis celebrating the last day of the week-long Jewish festival of Sukkot, during which thousands of Israelis holiday in Sinai.</p> <p>Two Britons were among those injured at the hotel. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the pair were not thought to have been seriously hurt, and added that anyone concerned about relatives and friends could ring the consular information line on 020 7008 0000. </p> <p>The explosions came one month after the Israeli government urged its citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a \"concrete\" terror threat to tourists. The warning, issued by Mr Sharon's office on September 9, identified the Sinai peninsula as the target of a potential attack. </p> <p>Following the blasts, Egypt upgraded a security alert at airports in Cairo and the southern tourist cities of Luxor, Hurghada and Aswan. Police searched cars coming in and out of Luxor and Hurghada and there was a heavy police presence around hotels. </p> <p>An Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said Israel would help evacuate any of up to 15,000 Israelis in Sinai who might wish to leave. Israel set up temporary accommodation in community centres, and Israeli radio reported a nationwide call for surgeons to go to Eilat, where the wounded were being transferred. </p> <p>Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, but relations have been cool as a result of Israeli military actions in Palestinian areas. The last major terror strike in Egypt came in 1997, when 58 foreign tourists were killed by Islamist extremists in Luxor.</p>",
  "To my surprise I actually found Tony Blair's speech very good. I think he made a strong point by reminding us about the achievements of a Labour government; rights won for the union movement, increases in many areas of public services, the pledges actually carried out. <p>When I started work in social services in 1994 the whole sector was beset by cutbacks, real doom and gloom with retrenchment the only policy available.</p> <p>He was also right to remind us how in the mid 90s the possibility of a Labour government was so scary to many in the country.</p> <p>Is the whole trust thing just a new bogeyman whipped up by the media to replace those dire fears of Labour governments? The media always seem to need to put a negative slant on everything.</p> <p>The policies unveiled were mostly worthy; a continuation of the past few years with a \"vision thing\" thrown in. And we need some kind of plan, and one is clearly there.</p> <p>I remain unhappy about the introduction of identity cards - they've had them in Spain for years and their presence didn't stop the Madrid bombers.</p> <p>The choice issue drives me demented: I'm currently receiving cancer services and I don't have the luxury of choice. And why would I want to go to say, London, at this stage? I need quality local service that meet my individual needs. </p> <p>At a micro level the one-size-fits-all philosophy is irritating, but can be addressed if you're assertive enough and challenge staff when they work in a particular way because it suits them.</p> <p>On a macro level, with serious health conditions, centres of excellence can't be available in every district unless there is some kind of private health system. The idea that I can shop around for better chemotherapy is just ludicrous. And don't get me started on choice in education ...</p> <p>How do I feel about Tony Blair for a full third term? What else could he say? I'm just not interested in the supposed personal issues between Blair and Brown. I think Gordon Brown would make an excellent leader and PM. The real issue is how much of an electoral liability is Tony Blair? (I hope you noticed my prescient statement at the end of <a href=\" http://politics.theguardian.com/floatingvoters/durkin/story/0,15109,1314066,00.html \">my last piece</a> about him not looking too good - next time I'm charging a fee!)</p> <p><b>Howard and the Tories</b></p> <p>Never mind Michael Howard's leadership - what about his hands? - what was he doing? Massaging (wringing) someone's neck?- I was mesmerised. He's trying desperately hard to be a leader but looks like he's lost the guidebook. I think he looked unconvincing.</p> <p>As to the timetable: if Michael Howard is to be believed, \"Day One\" is going to be very busy. Frankly I'd be happier if the home secretary wasn't telling police stations to put paperwork in the rubbish bin as their number one priority.</p> <p>I'm a bit confused about the policies (ie we've kind of got some, and we'll sort them out when we get into office, and oh, don't worry if they're not properly costed yet, because they soon will be. What is all that about?).</p> <p>To win my vote the Conservatives need to think through and cost out their ideas. I feel that they haven't really done the groundwork to fully challenge Labour's policies and get themselves on a credible track.</p> <p>A couple of focus groups and half a dozen opinion polls to dream up an election campaign just won't do it any more - politics needs more sophistication this century. In addition, I found it appalling that Michael Howard's family came here as refugees and he is now pulling up the drawbridge behind him.</p> <p>There are flaws in the asylum system that need addressing, but pulling out of the UN convention is not the solution.</p> <p>There are a couple of things from the Tory conference that did catch my attention. People's concerns with their rights and not their corresponding responsibilities - I think a good debate could be focussed on that. Also their thoughts on council tax and pensions.</p>",
  "\"I married my psychotic female prison warden as a cover for the fact that I was gay and then she got artificially inseminated, by paying my best friend to bring the afters in a jiffy bag to impregnate herself,\" the Tory candidate for Stockton South tells me with a wry smile. <p>Cynics may think this is typical of Tory hopefuls, who have traditionally needed a loyal and supportive wife to win selection, but James Gaddas is actually speaking about his role in popular ITV prison drama, Bad Girls, which he hopes to forgo for a parliamentary career.</p> <p>Avid soap fans will know him as Grayling, the rogue prison governor, whose evil antics keep 9.8 million viewers gripped every week. But he may become better known as one of the three celebrities pinning their political hopes to the Tory mast, alongside TV presenter Esther McVey and James Bethell from the Ministry of Sound. </p> <p>Unlike former TV presenter Robert Kilroy-Silk, who sought a return to politics in this June's European elections after his high profile sacking from the BBC, Gaddas is in the throes of a lucrative TV career.</p> <p>If elected, he says he will quit acting for good, though many in Westminster might chuckle behind their sleeve at the notion that a degree of the dramatic arts don't regularly come into play in Westminster. \"If people are going to put their trust in me as an MP, you have to repay that trust. All my energy will go into the job,\" he says earnestly.</p> <p>A general interest in politics took a new turn when his daughter, Cate, was born four years ago. When he got the word from Conservative central office that he didn't have to earn his spurs by lifetime membership of the Tory party and a grounding in local government, Gaddas put his name in the hat. </p> <p>\"I wanted more of an involvement in the society she will grow up in,\" he explains.</p> <p>Despite that touchy-feely answer, he is right behind the party's tough new plans to crack down on asylum and immigration, which have prompted accusations that it is playing the race card. He insists, however, that immigration \"needs to be controlled\". </p> <p>\"It is easy to be liberal about this but you have to look after genuine refugees. We are being swamped. Many people, rightly or wrongly, are blaming it for a lot of the country's ills.\"</p> <p>Incendiary language, but Gaddas insists he is softer on other issues. He can't see the fuss over sexual orientation and cites the day he persuaded his father that capital punishment was simply wrong as one of the greatest moments of his life. </p> <p>A Stockton grammar school boy who shuns the stereotype of the pinstripe-suited toff, he insists on sitting on the floor, cross legged, dressed in desert boots, faded blue chinos and a polo shirt that has seen a few spin cycles in its time, while his Tory peers swirl around him in dark suits and expensive looking shoes. </p> <p>With a fourth series of Bad Girls under way, Gaddas will lead a surreal double life - playing the governor accused of date rape and sexual harassment by colleagues by day, and in between filming gracing Stockton doorsteps to persuade voters of the seriousness of his political intentions. </p> <p> His current line of work does have some inbuilt advantages for a politician, however. Personable, handsome, he's the \"bloke next door \"with a Teeside lilt, the kind of guy you could bring home to meet your mother without fear of disapproval. </p> <p>Can Gaddas capitalise on the \"trust\" factor that has been the refrain of this year's Tory party by using his familiarity with viewers as prospective voters? He's not feeling complacent. </p> <p>\"What you are getting on the doorstep is people who voted for Labour at the last general election and felt let down but are not yet ready to vote for us. It is convincing we are the alternative. I am not going to pretend it is great just yet. I get good personal feedback and its now a matter of convincing them.\"</p>",

  "What's the point of a British political conference? <p>I ask because a couple of months ago I attended the Republican convention in New York. It rammed home the point to me that American conventions have a specific purpose. They occur every four years, and they serve as the launch pad of the presidential campaigns. They cost hundreds of millions of dollars; they define each candidate's position. And each candidate hopes for a post-convention \"bounce\" to launch them to victory, like a rocket leaving the atmosphere. </p> <p>By contrast, British political conferences have a more esoteric purpose. They are annual events, for no particularly good reason. They take place in October simply to fit in with the parliamentary calendar. And each year, the parties are forced to scrabble for a message to define their week beside the seaside, simply for the sake of it. </p> <p>But the parties will never give up their annual conferences. These showpiece events have the one overriding merit of giving each party a week-long media boost and each party is determined to reap the maximum benefit by communicating a simple and clear message to the wider world.</p> <p>On this test, however, both the Labour and Lib Dem conferences failed this year.</p> <p>If the main purpose of the Liberal Democrat conference was to position themselves as the official opposition, it did not come through. Instead, they were distracted by an ideological battle between modernisers and traditionalists, the modernisers keen to lurch to the right, the traditionalists wanting to stay in the mushy middle. It was capped by a surprisingly lacklustre speech by their party leader.</p> <p>Labour suffered similar confusion. The battle between the Brownites and the Milburnites meant that Labour was frozen by internal conflict, prevented from launching a radical set of new policies as Thatcher did in 1987. The party leadership, conscious of the need to address their core vote, ignored the wider electorate. And any benefit of their conference week was immediately discounted by Tony Blair launching the longest leadership battle in history. </p> <p>By contrast, the Conservative conference has been a resounding success. The reason was simple. We were far more ambitious than the other parties. We tried to do something different. And we succeeded.</p> <p>Every conference falls into the trap of ratcheting up the razzmatazz for the visiting media, rolling out the platitudes and the clich\u00e9s, ramping up the rhetoric. We consciously avoided this pitfall. </p> <p>Instead, we addressed the elephant in the room. While the other parties went about their business as if it was business as usual, the Conservatives have realised that something has changed. The voters are annoyed - not just with us but with all politicians. They were seduced by Blair's rhetoric and they feel let down. They will not be seduced again. All politicians are now tarred with the same brush. To woo them back, a party needs to show that it has a considered, well-thought out and practical approach. It is crucial not to over-promise.</p> <p>That can be hugely frustrating for the party activists. But it is essential. As Oliver Letwin pointed out, nothing could be more tempting and more easy than to promise large-scale tax cuts immediately. But in the real world, that may not be possible. So we will not promise what we cannot deliver. We have set out a clear timetable for action. And at its heart is one word that has been missing from politics for too long: accountability.</p> <p>If the conference took a different approach with the wider world, in other respects it was reassuringly the same. Conference is an annual reunion. People come from all over Britain to meet old friends and exchange notes. The bars and restaurants are full. Enormous feats of stamina are witnessed each night, as delegates drink into the early hours. Sadly, I am now too old for this and tend to slope off before midnight. For that reason, conference for me is a much more subdued affair. After 15 years of them, I am less inclined to seek out the best parties or prop up the bar.</p> <p>But what did make this week special for me was that Wantage Conservatives were out in force, sending the largest delegation for years to the conference. It was great to have a number of people who have only recently joined the party enjoying their first party conference. People like Bill Service, a Didcot councillor and former shop steward, who a couple of years ago had never had any political involvement at all, now at the heart of our local party.</p> <p>Wantage and Didcot Conservatives are not backward in coming forward. For the leader's speech they all positioned themselves at the front of the hall, and they all shook his hand as he made his way to the podium.</p> <p>All Tories, not just Wantage and Didcot Conservatives, are leaving Bournemouth with their tails up. Of course, one reason is because we have spent the last week enjoying each other's company. But there is more to it than just that. There is a feeling that we have now started the breakthrough with a clear message. We will be accountable. We will only promise what we can deliver. On the key issues - schools, hospitals, tax, crime and immigration - we have policies that will make a difference to people's lives. Above all, we have a leader who is effective, talented, understated, and passionate to serve the country that has given him so much.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ed Vaizey is Conservative parliamentary candidate for Wantage</p>",

  "<p>A criticism frequently levelled at the music industry is that it is overly enchanted with image. Take the example of Vince Power, founder of the Mean Fiddler empire, which counts the London Astoria and the Reading Festival among its many enterprises. He has a certain Phil Mitchell-like quality - stocky, balding, stubbly about the edges, with a whiff of the boxer about him, and a hardy upbringing in rural Ireland that together have forged a certain tough-guy image. </p> <p>\"Just because I'm Irish, people said I was being supported by the IRA,\" Power told the Guardian in 1999. \"That's crap. I got where I am by sheer hard work and a bit of luck - nothing else ... Because I came from nowhere, people like to think there must be more to it than that. People like to have their images.\" </p> <p>Protest though he may, it is an image that has certainly done him no harm. It is a reputation that growls: '\"You don't mess with Vince.\" </p> <p>He certainly casts a long shadow. Perhaps not surprisingly, few music industry insiders are eager to talk on-record about him. </p> <p>But for a while now, he has been trying to edge away from his hard-nosed image and recast himself as a cuddlier creature, referring in interviews to his charity work, his vintage cars and his love of leisurely Sunday brunches with his family. He has also set about quietly selling his 35% stake in the Mean Fiddler group, because, as he puts it, \"I think I've come as far as I can now; it is a plc. I was never a big plc fan.\" </p> <p>This week, however, he found himself back in the limelight when the sale of a 15% share of his stake - to the internet entrepreneur Richard Clingen - was blocked by shareholders. </p> <p>Clingen had been due to replace Power as the company's executive chairman, and had already marked the operations director, Dean James, as chief executive, dispatching Power's right-hand man, Melvin Benn. With the collapse of the sale, James was summarily removed from the board, and Power was reinstated at the company's helm. The dust has yet to settle. </p> <p>Power, 57, has built Mean Fiddler into a company worth bickering over, with a turnover of about \u00a355m a year and a 300-strong workforce. At 16, he rejected a career in artificial bull insemination in County Waterford, leaving for England and a procession of jobs: making ice cream, demolition, and a stint in the haberdashery department at Woolworths. </p> <p>He turned the corner towards fortune after he invested in an old van and drove around London collecting second-hand furniture to sell. </p> <p>Over the years, he has bought up music venues in much the same way. First came the original Mean Fiddler, a country and western club in Harlesden, north-west London, which he opened in 1982. The venue swiftly gained a reputation as a home for new acts such as the Pogues, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, and the Men They Couldn't Hang. </p> <p>Since then have come numerous other high-profile venues, such as the Garage, Jazz Cafe, Clapham Grand, Kentish Town Forum, Stratford Rex, and an array of festivals including the London Fleadh, Reading, and the now defunct Phoenix. </p> <p>Today, Power sits atop a total of eight festivals, 14 live music venues, restaurants, bars and a successful events firm, organising tours for the likes of Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. </p> <p>He is a man who evidently feels there is safety in numbers. Born one of 11 children, he has over the years amassed three wives, eight children and seven grandchildren, along with his \u00a330m fortune. </p> <p>A spoke is thought to have been put in Power's wheel, however, by a rival promoter, Denis Desmond, who built a 24% stake in Mean Fiddler last year. Through his Irish business, MCD, Desmond's investments include the V festival, the Brixton Academy and the Point in Dublin. Their rivalry dates back many years, with some pinpointing it to 1993, when Power trod firmly on Desmond's toes by bringing Fleadh Mor, an Irish incarnation of the London event, to County Waterford. In so doing, Power placed himself in direct competition with Desmond's Feile in County Tipperary. Ireland could not accommodate two festivals of that size, and despite stellar line-ups, both promoters lost money that year. </p> <p>Desmond is far from being the only person Power has riled over the years. There have been highly publicised spats with Westminster council over fly-posting for his venues, and a shooting incident at the Astoria in 2001, which resulted in a recommendation that the venue's licence be revoked. </p> <p>In the early days, too, Power made few friends by dealing directly with artists himself rather than with their managers. Then, earlier this summer, he had something of a tussle with one of the best-loved figures in the music industry, the Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis. </p> <p>Mean Fiddler became involved with Glastonbury following the 2000 festival, when gatecrashers pushed the venue well beyond its licensed capacity, incurring a fine for Eavis and throwing the future of the festival into doubt. Reassured by the involvement of an events company as reputed as Mean Fiddler, Mendip council agreed to grant Glastonbury another licence. Mean Fiddler secured a 20% stake in the festival, which rises by 10% each year. </p> <p>However, by June this year, the relationship had soured. Power gave an interview to the Daily Telegraph in the run-up to this summer's festival in which he seemed to take credit for Glastonbury's increased success and improved security. Eavis was incensed. \"It's nothing to do with Vince, that's the thing,\" he says, with considerable exasperation. \"And I get annoyed about it.\" </p> <p>Yet the Mean Fiddler-Glastonbury partnership is set to continue until 2006. \"The paperwork - I wouldn't really call it a contract - is just two sides of A4, handwritten; we had more of a verbal agreement to work together until 2006,\" explains Eavis. \"After that, I'll probably retire but, oh yeah, of course I would hesitate to renew the agreement.\" </p> <p>It seems that Power's way of working is characteristically antagonistic. </p> <p>\"Vince and I go back a long, long way, specifically we had a workable relationship in the '90s when I was editing the NME,\" recalls Steve Sutherland, now the executive director of the New Musical Express. \"We used to dance a familiar tango every year, with the Mean Fiddler feeding us news stories about the Reading festival and the Phoenix. And then, as sure as Easter or Christmas will come around every year, and often as late as a couple of days before the Reading festival itself, I would get a call saying, 'Vince Power's on the line: could you hold?' And Vince would come on the line and use all sorts of language - call me things I couldn't say to you.\" </p> <p>It seems Power felt that the NME devoted an excessive amount of coverage to the Glastonbury festival, at the expense of Reading. \"He would end up saying all of the NME were banned from Reading and from all Mean Fiddler events. And then I would spend the next two hours with him on the phone, trying to make it right, basically.\" </p> <p>Despite the gripes, Power's contribution to the British music scene cannot be denied. Over the years, he has shepherded many new bands towards fame and fortune, as well as furnishing the country with some of its finest music venues and festivals. \"In fairness to him,\" admits Eavis, \"through Mean Fiddler, the Jazz Cafe, all those venues in London, and the Reading festival, I suppose he's certainly raised the profile of live music.\" </p> <p>Tim Perry, who books bands for the Windmill, a venue in Brixton, says Mean Fiddler \"has always been really nice with us. The Garage is one of my favourite venues in London; Reading and Leeds are my favourite festivals because it's just about bands.\" </p> <p>He cites ticket prices in the capital as his only beef with the company, but admits \"everyone's as guilty as everyone else - it's not just Mean Fiddler\". </p> <p>It's wrong, he argues, to suggest that Power has a stranglehold over London's music venues. The company doesn't, for example, boast any of London's biggest venues. \"Power hasn't anywhere of the capacity of Brixton Academy,\" he points out. \"It's really not a monopoly.\" </p> <p>If Power succeeds in selling his share in Mean Fiddler, and if Desmond increases his own stake, the country's music venues may, in fact, be in far greater danger of monopolisation. </p> <p>\"Slowly but surely, there is a creeping consolidation of promotions companies - Denis Desmond, SJM, Clear Channel,\" observes Sutherland. \"And it's kind of natural at some stage that one fish will swallow another. It's hard now to think there was once a time when you could put a name and a face to enterprises. With Vince, you had a feisty face to the festival and, yes, I always found him intimidating, but not immovable. It's more difficult with a corporation - with Vince you knew it might have been painful, but you knew what you were getting.\" </p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong> Born </strong> April 27 1947, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford </p> <p><strong> Education </strong> Kilmacthomas primary school, Dungarvan Vocational College.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday October 9 2004</strong> </p> <p>East Timor was colonised by the Portuguese and not the Dutch, as we mistakenly say below. </p> <p>  </p> <p> Newspaper headlines are generally designed to terrify the public while the journalists who concoct them remain indifferent. But a story yesterday had the opposite effect; readers shrugged and turned the page while reporters everywhere spluttered on their pints, skipped breakfast and dashed straight to work. \"The outsourcing of journalism,\" declared the Guardian, as the news agency Reuters began shifting its financial coverage to Bangalore. \"This is an outrage!\" said Telegraph leader-writers, who'd just finished an editorial about how British workers must accept pay cuts to compete with call centres in India. \"These Asians...\" ranted the Daily Star hacks - \"they stay over there, and take our jobs!\" </p> <p>Reuters journalists had been writing for some time about how cost-efficient it might be for corporations to take advantage of India's highly educated workforce. At least now they know that their bosses bother to read their stuff. \"Breaking news will continue to be reported from the world's financial centres,\" wrote the media company's press secretary, struggling with the two removal men who were carrying out his desk. \"Journalists miles away from the actual stories?\" exclaimed one outraged cub reporter. \"How will they check for mistakes?\" At which point the entire newsroom looked at him with one eyebrow raised and he was quietly shown the door. </p> <p>Without anyone realising, this has been happening in local newspapers for some time. Trainee journalists in India get to their computers at 8am and by lunchtime have produced all the news stories that you read in your local freesheet. The template is straightforward; the software prompts the operator to make a series of simple choices to create a typical local news report... \"Pensioner mugged for only 10p/50p/\u00a31.20 (delete accordingly). \"A cowardly attack on a local pensioner was carried out in broad daylight/in the park/in this court report I just read/earlier this week. The attacker was wearing a bomber jacket and jeans/a hooded top and trainers/and fled the scene with only ... p (insert pitiful amount here). Police said this was a particularly despicable/shocking/vague/story and are warning pensioners to take extra care/stay inside/not to read their local newspaper and live in permanent terror.\" </p> <p>To balance up this routinely depressing item the would-be journalists are then presented with heart-warming reports such as \"Hospice Hero Cycling to Scotland!\" and \"Brownies Cake Sale Takes the Biscuit!\" to put above \"notice of planning application for new conservatory\". Then they just press \"send\" on their computer and the next day four copies of the local advertiser are pushed through your door. </p> <p>But now the software has been refined so that Indian computer operators can write the stories for British national newspapers too. The subject matter differs according to which newspaper the journalist writes for. Click on the Daily Mail icon and you get the headline \"Asylum Seekers Threat to House Prices\", and the piece pretty well writes itself from there - although the software prevents you deleting the words \"mother of two\", \"fear\" and \"Islamic extremists\". Click on the Sun and you get: \"It's Christine Agui-Leera!\" You just have to write the caption for a photo of an attractive young singer with a low-cut dress and faulty bra. </p> <p>Soon, London will be full of unemployed journalists, Fleet Street's finest former wordsmiths holding up cardboard signs saying \"hungrey and homless - plese halp\". And the placards of the Murdoch crew will include a plug for what's on Sky that night. </p> <p>But this is payback time for centuries of colonisation. Britain occupied India, imposed the English language and left the country significantly poorer, so that 200 years later it is cheaper to get Indians to compile our crosswords and review the new Dido album. Some former colonies are in a better position than others. \"Right,\" says the finance minister of East Timor, \"we're setting up an online news agency.\" </p> <p>\"But we were colonised by Holland. I'm afraid there's not much call for Dutch financial journalism.\" </p> <p>\"Even in the Netherlands?\" </p> <p>\"Nope, they speak better English than the Americans.\" </p> <p>Unless of course this is an elaborate plan to halt immigration. The presumption was always that third world workers hoped to come and work in the paradise that was Europe or America. Give them a few months of learning about the sort of newspapers we read and they'll all be saying: \"Er, actually, I think I'll stay right here, thank you very much.\" </p> <p>Although this column will continue to be credited to John O'Farrell it has now been outsourced to topical comedy writers in southern India. No discernible change in standard is anticipated. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday October 9 2004</b> <br> We inadvertently changed the nationalities of Barry Burns and the band Mogwai in the feature below on Welsh identity. Burns is Scottish and the band is from Glasgow. <p>Before taking the train from Paddington station in London for Cardiff earlier this week, I thought it would be nice to buy a Welsh newspaper and a guidebook to Cool Cymru. I wanted to get some in-train insight into that proud nation of footballer Ryan Giggs, movie star Catherine Zeta-Jones, clothes designer Julien Macdonald, rappers Goldie Lookin Chain and, to a lesser extent, Rhys Ifans and Huw Edwards. Not to mention my own ancestors. Some hope. It proved very easy to buy a copy of the Scottish newspaper the Herald. Easy, too, to pick up a guidebook to Scotland. No matter that trains do not go north of the border from Paddington. No matter that the station's departure boards suggest that lots of trains go to that forgotten land that allegedly starts where Shropshire gives up. </p> <p>Maybe, I thought, as the train left Bristol Parkway and headed through the Severn Tunnel, those departure boards lied. Perhaps they were lures into a land that doesn't really exist. Evidence for this thesis came on Tuesday, when The Eurostat Yearbook 2004 was published by the EU. It had a picture of Europe on the cover. Only one problem: Wales wasn't on it. Some 2.9 million people had fallen into the Irish Sea. The Western Mail, the national newspaper of Wales, printed a handy dot-to-dot map of Wales for Euro map-makers to cut out and keep for future reference. </p> <p>Wales, you might be forgiven for thinking, is the land fated to be ignored. Alone among the home countries, for instance, it doesn't feature on the union flag. The Western Mail leader yesterday put it this way: \"Blanking Wales from the map reminds us of Stalin's habit of removing his enemies from group photographs.\" </p> <p>Steady on, boyos - it was probably just a slip of a Eurocrat's computer keyboard. This Stalinist analysis, you might think (if you were English), typifies Welsh chippiness. Surely the Welsh would do well to develop a thicker skin. There is no plot against Wales; just an amnesia brought on by the insignificance of the nation's contribution to an irksomely anglophiliac world. I put this hypothesis to a group of young people in a pub called Y Mochyn Du (Black Pig) in Cardiff's Sophia Gardens district, and, surprisingly, was not punched into oblivion. </p> <p>In Y Mochyn Du, where men and women meet to converse in Welsh, Huw Hughes asked me a rhetorical question: \"Why are the Welsh so chippy? Because when I go into a supermarket in Bangor there is a sign advertising football shirts that says 'Support your local team', meaning the England football team. Why am I so chippy? Because my daughter asks if she can have a David Beckham shirt.\" </p> <p>Huw Hughes (\"I know it sounds unlikely, but I was the seventh of the children and maybe they'd run out of names\") works on sustainable development for Environment Wales. He isn't so much angry as disappointed about this English cultural colonialism, particularly in the run-up to tomorrow's World Cup qualifier at Old Trafford between England and Wales. \"One of the great hopes I have for the United Kingdom is that it will be genuinely pluralistic. The UK should be able to nurture a minority culture like Welsh rather than obliterate it.\" </p> <p>His friend Eifion Williams, a former Labour parliamentary candidate who is establishing a community recycling network in Wales, had another gripe. \"BBC News has had several reports on the minutiae of Sven's team's preparations for the game. So given that the BBC is supposed to represent the UK, you would expect them to have lots about Mark Hughes's preparations with the Welsh team. But no.\" </p> <p>Huw, Eifion and their friend Elaine all eagerly want Wales to win, though they fear they won't. \"I reckon it will be 2-2,\" says Huw. </p> <p>Not as optimistic as Bryn Terfel, the great Welsh bass-baritone who is currently rehearsing Don Giovanni in Chicago, then: \"I'm keenly hoping we can start with a win,\" he says when I phone him later. \"Old Trafford is the home to my favourite team, the mighty reds. On Saturday it'll be home to another set of mighty reds. I think this could be a powerful omen.\" </p> <p>Rhodri Morgan, Wales's first minister, is worried that the team's away record is not good enough. \"It's the David and Goliath thing, though - the Welsh love to see themselves as David slaying an England that is 17 times bigger than Wales. I'm not sure if it will happen this time. But ever since the 1870s, when international sporting events like these really started, a great deal of Welsh pride has been invested in sporting achievements over the English, in rugby, obviously, but also in football. </p> <p>\"It used to drive Lloyd George to distraction. He was a member of the Liberal wing called Cymru Fydd (Wales Will Be) that campaigned for Irish and Welsh devolution together. But he could never grasp the industrial psychology of the South Wales workers who cared more about beating England than winning home rule.\" </p> <p>Does the same apply today? \"No. I think we're trying in Wales to do two things: political evolution and sporting success, in tandem. I don't think that means we'll necessarily win, though.\" </p> <p>Other Welsh people are more aggressively anti-English. When, for instance, England played Croatia in the European Championships earlier this year, multi-instrumentalist Barry Burns, on tour in Zagreb with his band Mogwai, told the Croatian media: \"I'd love Croatia to beat England. Please destroy the bastards.\" Burns could not be contacted to express his hopes this time, but they may well have been unprintable. </p> <p>Anti-English sentiment has always existed in Wales. But a national self-confidence that had been made seemingly absurd by the mid-20th century attacks - first of Dylan Thomas in Under Milk Wood and then Kingsley Amis in The Old Devils - has renewed itself more recently. When Catatonia's Cerys Matthews sang that every morning when she woke up she thanked the Lord she was Welsh, it may not have played well on the other side of Offa's Dyke, but it reflected a growing mood, and one that was not utterly dependent on sporting achievement. </p> <p>It has also been buoyed up by devolution, the growth in Welsh language learning, the international success of Welsh bands such as the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals, and the opening of the Millennium stadium in Cardiff. It will be further boosted next month when the marvellous slate, steel and glass Millennium Centre cultural complex at Cardiff Bay opens in two gala concerts under the creative leadership of Terfel. Gone are the memories of the shabby way Zaha Hadid's Cardiff opera house plans were dismissed; now something called Cool Cymru is thriving as never before. </p> <p>This growing mood of national pride has occasionally faltered. The establishment of the Welsh Assembly in 1997, the first political assembly since Owain Glyndwr disappeared in 1406, followed a referendum in which the majority in favour of devolution was only 7,000. Political debate in the chamber was often derided as inane and circumlocutious. Perhaps members were falling to that supposedly common Welsh ailment, Kinnockian windbaggery. \"It has been an effective assembly,\" counters Morgan. \"Since Labour came to power in 1999, unemployment, which was much higher in Wales than the UK, is now lower. Infant mortality rates are lower, GCSE A to C grades are higher. These simple facts show the assembly has been worthwhile.\" </p> <p>\"I think things have moved on in the past few years and now a lot of the Cool Cymru ethos is about pride in the assembly,\" says Janet Ryder, a Plaid Cymru assembly member for North Wales. \"There's a real sense that we can stand on our own two feet. I don't think you'd find any people in Wales now who would want the assembly to be scrapped. Rather, I think a lot of people want our powers to be extended. They want us to take charge of all areas of education, of the police and ambulance services and not just the fire brigade.\" </p> <p>This week, members started to debate the Richard Commission report on whether the Welsh assembly should have more legislative powers and thus become akin to the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. \"The key resistance to that is from a fear of the diminution of Welsh MPs' powers in Westminster,\" says Ryder. \"They've seen what happened in Scotland and I'm sure they would feel like turkeys voting for Christmas in backing it.\" </p> <p>The sensibilities of Westminster turkeys notwithstanding, perhaps now is the time for Wales to self-confidently take charge of its own destiny and wield real political power for the first time in 700 years. After all, the giddy pomp of the Cardiff Bay redevelopment will come to a climax next year when Richard Rogers' new assembly building opens. </p> <p>But Cool Cymru was never even principally about devolution. It had a linguistic tenor unimagined in the philosophy of its big-headed big brother, Cool Britannia. In 1982 a Plaid Cymru campaign that included a hunger strike by MP Gwynfor Evans led to the Conservative government redeeming its election pledge to establish S4C, the Welsh-medium TV channel. Enthusiasm for learning Welsh grew during the rest of the decade. Welsh-medium schools opened and thrived. Now 20% of the country speaks the language - still overwhelmingly in the north-west. </p> <p>Of course, during those two decades the extraction of black gold from the South Wales valleys ended, to be replaced by the ingestion of drugs as well as soaring unemployment, but let's not spoil the story. The nurturing of the Welsh language, when the other Celtic tongues that were once widely spoken across the British Isles survive hardly at all, is a great source of Welsh pride. </p> <p>\"When we came to North Wales from England in 1989,\" says Sunderland-born Ryder, \"I couldn't speak a word of Welsh. But I made it my business to learn - to be part of the community. Me and my husband put our children in the Welsh-medium school that was bolted on to the English school in our village. It was a great decision.\" </p> <p>What is the point in learning Welsh? \"There are so many,\" says Huw Hughes. \"You just have the literary tradition of Shakespeare. I also have a great literary tradition you can't really grasp, as well as Shakespeare. It gives me an access to the tradition of my own ancestors, too.\" </p> <p>But the Welsh language is a tender flower. Large numbers of non-Welsh speakers have been moving to traditional centres of the language, causing resentment as they inflate property prices and, unlike Ryder, do not become involved in local traditions. At the same time, the main Welsh towns and cities are near England, that great sucking vortex of Anglo-American globalised values and so they are often ill-inclined to learn the language of their ancestors. </p> <p>The Welsh-language pressure group Cymuned announced earlier this week that it is preparing a campaign of civil disobedience to defend Welsh-speaking communities. Last weekend, its members blocked the A44 into Aberystwyth to highlight the issue of students who stay in town after graduation but do not try to learn Welsh. Not exactly the same as the Sons of Glendower burning holiday homes, but there is clearly still much resentment of English interlopers. </p> <p>The threat to Welsh isn't quite so brutal as it was in the 19th century, when speaking Welsh was regarded as offensive by Anglocentric educators. \"In the days of the \"Welsh Not\" in the 19th century,\" says Huw's friend Elaine, \"if I said something in Welsh at school, the teacher would put a piece of string with a board around my neck with the legend \"Welsh Not\". If Eifion then said something to me in Welsh, the board would be hung around his neck. Then if Elaine said something in Welsh to me at playtime, it would be hung around her neck. At the end of the day, the one with the Welsh Not would have their hand spanked.\" </p> <p>I did not know that. Clearly it was time to take an Englishman's remedial tour of Wales. I decided on a coast-to-coast journey from Cardiff Bay in the south to Llandudno in the north. Some hope. Thanks to Dr Beeching, 1960s scourge of the railways, there are no train services from the Welsh capital to North Wales that do not involve crossing back in to England. There used to be a railway from Carmarthen to Aberystwyth that continued north, but no longer. And there are no internal flights. So I decided to drive, and in doing so found a country that is geographically divided and thus culturally very diverse. </p> <p>When the drinkers at Y Mochyn Du learned what I was planning, they suggested a consciousness-raising itinerary. I followed it as closely as possible, though I did get hopelessly lost between Builth Wells and Tregaron and found myself rising and falling along single-tracked roads fringed by gloriously dying golden bracken and confronted by unexpectedly grand, sunny mountain vistas that opened up between October showers. I think here I found what the Welsh writer Jan Morris this week called \"a love land, impervious to the vulgarities of map-makers and politicians\". I was for a while delightfully lost. </p> <p>But I did find Cilmeri, a suggested stop on the itinerary, where there is a monument to Llewellyn ap Gruffydd, killed by an English soldier in 1282. Huw describes this Welsh hero as \"the last true Prince of Wales\". Unlike, presumably, our own proper Charlie. And I did visit Trawsfynydd, the home town of the 20th-century Welsh poet Hedd Wynn, another national hero. \"He believed in the Welsh place in the UK,\" Huw had told me. \"He went off to fight in world war one and he died in battle.\" He died before he was able to collect the Welsh poetry prize at the Eisteddfod that he had so coveted. </p> <p>Most piquantly, I visited Llyn Celyn dam near Bala. It was here that, in 1965, the village of Capel Celyn was deemed expendable in order to meet England's purportedly greater needs. It was drowned by waters rising behind the dam on the river Tryweryn to secure water supplies to Liverpool. I sat in the small chapel of remembrance and thought about my Welsh ancestors, who may well feel betrayed that their descendants left Wales for the richer pickings of the West Midlands, flooding other Welsh valleys to create reservoirs to provide the English with water. If I was Welsh, I'd be resentful. </p> <p>\"It was the Westminster decision to allow this dam to happen, against the vote of all the Welsh MPs including the Tories, that really provided momentum for the devolution movement,\" says Eifion Williams. \"It was really a crime against humanity.\" </p> <p>I went on to Llandudno, which Huw had said was \"the shame of Wales\". Why? \"Because when you go into Marks &amp; Spencer there and speak Welsh they give you a filthy look and say, \"What?\" And yet Llandudno is the main town in the middle of a large Welsh-speaking area. It is a betrayal of Welshness.\" </p> <p>I am a poor judge of that matter, chiefly because I cannot as yet ask for Chicken Tikka Masala with a Peshwari nan in Welsh. But, like Ryder, I could always learn. \"Now I'm so Welsh that I'm going to be rooting for Wales on Saturday,\" says the English-born Welsh nationalist. \"I've opted for a nation with a real future.\" And maybe she has.</p>",
  "The surge of violence in the Middle East spilled across Israel's southern border into Egypt last night as more than 30 holidaymakers were killed and scores more injured in a devastating series of apparently coordinated car bomb attacks in Red Sea resorts. <p>Israeli security officials said they believed a car bomb was responsible for a huge blast that ripped through the Hilton hotel in Taba, a resort town in Sinai just yards from the border which is popular with young Israeli holidaymakers. </p> <p>Witnesses said people were still trapped under the burning wreckage of the 10-storey hotel last night, at least part of which collapsed in the explosion. </p> <p>Ambulances and rescue crews streamed across the border from the nearby Israeli town of Eilat. </p> <p>Extra medical and rescue teams and stocks of blood were flown to the southern town. </p> <p>\"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed,\" one witness, Yigal Vakni, told Israel's Army Radio. \"There are dozens of people on the floor, lots of blood. It is very tense. I am standing outside the hotel, the whole thing is burning and they have nothing to put it out with.\" </p> <p>Later, two other blasts shook the resorts of Nueiba and Ras al-Sultan, south-west of Taba. At least one Egyptian was killed in Ras al-Sultan, with as many as 42 injured in the two attacks. Israeli officials said 30 were killed at Taba and at least 100 injured. Dozens of the wounded filed across the floodlit border last night to reach an Israeli hospital. </p> <p>Two Britons were caught in the Hilton blast but the Foreign Office said it was not thought they were seriously injured. </p> <p>Taba is the gateway to dozens of resorts on the Red Sea coast on the Sinai peninsula which are very popular with young Israelis, and an estimated 10,000 are currently in the region for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. </p> <p>Last night the Israeli foreign ministry began an operation to evacuate all Israeli tourists from Sinai. Israel had warned last month that citizens should not visit Egypt, citing a \"concrete\" terror threat to tourists. </p> <p>\"Recently, a concrete possibility has emerged that terrorists will try to attack tourist centres in Egypt, especially the Sinai,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement on its website. However, Egyptian officials said they had no evidence of terrorism. </p> <p>The Sinai peninsula was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six Day war and returned under a 1979 deal that resulted in a formal peace deal between the two neighbours - one of the few deals that Israel has with Arab states. </p> <p>Sinai shares a border with the Gaza Strip, where more than 80 Palestinians have been killed in the past 10 days in an Israeli offensive designed to stop militants from firing rockets into southern Israel. An adviser to Yasser Arafat denied Palestinians were behind the Egyptian attacks. </p> <p>The Bedouin inhabitants of the Sinai do not harbour the same antipathy for Israel and Israelis as other Arabs. Some of the best diving in the world can be found along the Sinai Red Sea coast. </p> <p>Most holidaymakers go for beach holidays but other Israelis go to use casinos which are illegal in Israel. The Taba Hilton, which was built when Israel held the Sinai, incorporated a casino. </p> <p>In Ras al-Sultan and Nueiba, tourists camp or stay in beach huts. There are larger-scale resorts popular with Europeans in Sharm al Sheik and Dahab. </p> <p>The bombs threaten serious damage for the region's tourist trade which relies on Israel for the bulk of its income. </p> <p>The Egyptian government has often acted as an intermediary between Israel and the Palestinians, who have often felt aggrieved that Egypt appeared more as an emissary of the United States than an advocate of their rights. </p> <p>Egyptian officials have been playing a role in Ariel Sharon's disengagement plan, offering to train Palestinian security forces and increase security along the Gaza-Egypt border. </p> <p>Israeli officials complained that Israeli rescue teams were denied permission to cross into Egypt for up to an hour after the blast. </p> <p>Taba, a collection of several hotels, has no major rescue services. Other rescue personnel were not allowed to cross into Egypt without a passport, according to Israel media.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Howard yesterday sent Conservative activists home from their most successful party conference in a decade, after suppressing years of faction-fighting and injecting his supporters with the hope that they might just pull off a sensational election victory against the odds next year. </p> <p>The Tory leader's prospects seem as slender as those of his hero, Winston Churchill, in 1940. But by deploying relentless Churchillian optimism against the odds this week he may finally have ended the long \"War of Thatcher's succession\" and largely reunited his faction-riven party. </p> <p>Mr Howard said he would step down if he became a liability - \"absolutely, no ifs or buts\" - and that the Tories still had a lot of hard work to get their policies across to a disaffected electorate. </p> <p>\"I don't think, if you look back, that we have always used the time we've had in opposition as well as we could or should have done,\" he conceded, in an oblique reference to the traumatic recent years under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith which culminated in a frenzy of plotting at last year's conference. </p> <p>Mr Howard reminded Labour and Lib Dem voters that only he can defeat Tony Blair. </p> <p>\"To those who voted Labour last time, who dream of a better life, who work hard, but feel let down, I say, come and join us. We are the only choice if you want a government that gives you value for money for the taxes you pay,\" he said in a brief closing mini-speech. </p> <p>To signal his determination the 63-year-old Tory leader left the Bournemouth conference centre to take shadow ministers on a campaign tour in marginal North Dorset where they started delivering the first of 11m election pledge cards. </p> <p>The Tory \"timetable for action\" message, unclear for so long, is being boiled down to five pledges covering the agenda polls and focus groups tell all parties are what matters: discipline in schools; locally run and cleaner hospitals; tougher policies on crime; better control of immigration; and a start towards slimmer government and lower taxes. </p> <p>Mr Howard subjected himself to a friendly TV cross-examination by the veteran broadcaster Michael Brunson, conducted before a packed audience of 1,500 supporters. Mr Howard revealed that it was anger over the turbulent state of the NHS in East Kent that drove him back into frontline politics in 2001 and that his political hero remained the wartime premier. Churchill's defiance of Hitler's Germany when the British Empire stood alone in 1940 stood as a \"huge lesson\" about the difference that one man's will can make.</p> <p>The measure of the challenge Mr Howard and his rivals face was reinforced yesterday when research for the politics website ePolitix.com found that 76% of people have little or no interest in the party conferences. Mr Howard assured whoever was watching on TV that, if elected, he would not seek a fourth term.</p>",
  "<p>It's amazing what you can get away with by saying it's a social experiment for the telly. Right, darling, I want you to give up your job and start behaving a bit more like a wife. You know, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. That means get in the kitchen, woman. Do some cooking, do the cleaning and, most importantly, do what I tell you to. And while you're at it, perhaps you could start making more of an effort with your appearance, tidy yourself up a bit. Right, it's time for the match. Be a good girl will you, and bring me and the lads a tray of cold beers and nibbles? And shut those bloody kids up. </p> <p>Honestly, that's what they're doing, on <strong> Make Me a Perfect Wife</strong> (Channel 4). Five working women, all from the same Surrey village, give up their paid jobs for a month, along with all of their principles, in order to spend more time making their menfolk happy. On hand are experts to give advice on how to behave, dress, massage and bake sponge cakes. Because, as everyone knows, a sponge cake is what really makes a man happy. </p> <p>Trouble is, the fellas are rubbish at playing the dominant male, so accustomed are they to being walked all over. So off they go for a day with Ken, the ex-fighter pilot, to learn a bit of assertiveness and find their inner man. Ken shows them how to punch through wooden boards, fire a gun, and walk on red-hot coals. After a day with Ken, our men are real men. Kind of. </p> <p>For Sarah and Sam, the experiment doesn't go so well. When Sam gets home from work, to be greeted at the door by Sarah, who's all dolled up and and gorgeous, he just looks suspicious. \"What's going on?\" he asks. \"I'm scared.\" Come on, Sam, where's that inner man? </p> <p>\"We're having our 15 golden minutes when you get home from work,\" explains his wife. </p> <p>\"I'm sorry? Oh, OK,\" says Sam, without much enthusiasm. </p> <p>They sit awkwardly on the sofa together, before Sarah remembers what the relationship expert said. \"Would you like me to rub your shoulders?\" she asks. And then adds, \"dear\". </p> <p>\"I really wouldn't, actually,\" says Sam, with a nervous giggle. And when Sarah disappears into the kitchen to fetch some snacks, he confesses that he'd really much rather spend 15 minutes on his own after work. </p> <p>It doesn't really matter, though, because Sarah can't keep up the act for long. Soon she's nagging at him again, they're bickering away, and they both look happier and more comfortable. Maybe there's a lesson in there somewhere. </p> <p>There was more bickering on <strong> Horizon</strong> (BBC2), of all places. The dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago, when a giant meteorite smashed into Mexico, says Jan Smit. The resulting tsunamis, the forest fire and the soot that obliterated the sun all contributed to wipe them out. That's what happened. </p> <p>No it isn't, says Gerta Keller. </p> <p>Yes it is. No it isn't. Tis. Tisn't. Tis too. You're just saying that, Mr Smit, because your whole reputation depends on your poxy little theory. </p> <p>Keller says that, actually, they went on living for a further 300,000 years after this impact. Both appear to be using the same evidence to support their theories. </p> <p>As it turns out, they may both be wrong. The dinosaurs may have died out through the normal evolutionary process. Or it could have been a combination of all three. Fascinating. </p> <p>There's going to be less bickering on <strong> The Farm</strong> (Five) now that Terry Christian's gone. I'm a bit cross with the public about this. They just don't get it. You don't vote to keep the people you like most, you vote for the people who make the programme most interesting. Get rid of that one who used to be in a boy band. And the one called Jeff who's famous because he used to go out with someone from another reality TV show. </p> <p>But no, first to be kicked off was Lady Victoria Hervey. She did nothing, was posh, and wound everyone up (ie she was brilliant). And now they've gone and got rid of our Terry. Who's going to pick arguments with people now? Or get at Vanilla Ice about the war? Who else would ask Rebecca Loos whether, during her affair with David Beckham, they ever indulged in \"fudge-packing\"? Terry was good value. </p> <p>Oh well, it's too late now. The public have ruined it. Time to switch off.</p>",
  "<p>Dawn seeps through the bleached curtain and Thembeni Ndlovu rouses the five children beside her. </p> <p>Yawning and stretching they shuffle into the sun while Thembeni fills a plastic bowl for bathing, sweeps the yard and scours bare cupboards for breakfast. </p> <p>Their clothes ragged, their feet bare, their bellies empty, the Ndlovu children are orphans. Thembeni, the eldest at 11, is the head of the household. She has been forced into adulthood by the death of her parents from Aids and in Kamhlushwa, a dusty village on South Africa's border with Swaziland, there are dozens like her. </p> <p>The UN estimates that 11 million children in sub-Saharan Africa have lost at least one parent to the disease. By the end of the decade there will be 20 million. Aid agencies say extended family networks of uncles, aunts and grandparents are increasingly overwhelmed, leaving orphans to fend for themselves. </p> <p>This is the story of just one such family. </p> <p>The Ndlovu children are still together and attend school but Thembeni's attempt to raise them is an unequal battle against poverty, neglect and her own youth. Asked what she wants most she replies: \"Food. And toys - a doll.\" </p> <p>A design on her black T-shirt says \"I rule\", and the siblings do follow her orders. </p> <p>While she collects firewood Sunday, 10, sweeps the house, Velaphi, eight, fetches water and Sannie, seven, washes dishes. Only the youngest, Thokoza, five, and Jane, four, are allowed to loaf. </p> <p>Thembeni boils water for tea over a fire in the yard. Once the tea is drunk she scoops up the household's one toy, a sock rolled into a ball, and oversees a game of catch. It is a display of resilience and spirit but cracks are visible. Behind his bucktooth smile Sunday, the oldest boy, is moody and combative. Thokoza, the youngest boy, is withdrawn. </p> <p>In contrast to his brothers, Velaphi, the eight-year-old, heaves a wheelbarrow of water canisters from the pump, usually a job for stout women. </p> <p>The younger girls, Sannie and Jane, show promise at school but homework is not a priority and the one book in the house, a Roald Dahl paperback, George's Marvellous Medicine, is missing half its pages. There is no electricity and often no money for candles or paraffin for the lamp. </p> <p>The children are not entirely alone. A local charity, Thembalethu Home Based Care, pays an adult neighbour, Lerato Ndlovu (no relation), \u00a323 a month to cook and clean and a Catholic nun donates food. </p> <p>Mrs Ndlovu complains that Thembeni allows her siblings to play past midnight and friends to eat their stock of oats and maize: \"She plays too much.\" </p> <p>By Kamhlushwa's standards the family had been well off: a house made of brick with window panes and electrical goods powered by car batteries. Now the television gathers dust and the fridge contains eight toilet rolls and cough medicine, but no food. </p> <p>Since they have their birth certificates and their parents' death certificates each sibling is entitled to a monthly grant of \u00a345 but welfare officials refuse to pay, according to Sally McKibbin, the founder of Thembalethu Home Based Care: \"The bureaucracy is not responding to HIV/Aids. The government has not catered for this disaster.\" </p> <p>The Ndlovu children are learning to ration food and grow vegetables on a plot the size of three beach towels but Thembeni struggles with the responsibility. </p> <p>\"If the food finishes there is no one I can tell,\" she says. </p> <p>As the sun sets the six children strip and again wash from the plastic bowl on the porch. From neighbouring houses parents can be heard summoning their children home for supper. </p> <p>In their yard in inky blackness they play Tiger, a game involving much shouting and running. Later, huddled around a candle in the house, they start a hymn but do not know all the words so launch into the national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika (God Save Africa). </p> <p>Jane, unaware that today is her fourth birthday, rubs her eyes, clearly tired, but her siblings so enjoyed the song that they sing it five more times. </p> <p>Eventually Thembeni decrees it is time to sleep and the children clamber into the two beds they share. For a few hours the house is silent. </p> <p>To help Thembalethu Home Based Care, contact Sally McKibbin at <a href=\"mailto:smck@worldonline.co.za\">smck@worldonline.co.za</a></p>",
  "<p>Chest x-ray vans will return to England's inner cities as part of a plan to combat the increase in TB cases, which have risen by a quarter in a decade. </p> <p>Vehicles fitted with digital systems that allow rapid chest screening for 300 people a day are seen as crucial to reducing the 6,638 diagnoses annually. </p> <p>Health officials have been so impressed with trials of a van from the Netherlands that up to half a dozen could be employed to target groups most at risk of developing the disease, which kills 350 a year and is expensive to treat. </p> <p>The mobile units will be radically different from those used in the 1950s and 60s. New technology eliminates delays in processing x-rays, making it easier to keep track of suspect patients. The systems also result in less radiation and will be used in a far more targeted manner. </p> <p>Hostels for homeless people and those addicted to drugs or alcohol, centres for asylum seekers and prisons are among the venues likely to be visited. Vans might also be used in ethnic minority communities, as well as to help treat patients in outbreaks. </p> <p>Evaluation of the trial is not complete, and decisions on how many and where to use vans have still to be made, but the impression so far has been positive. The project is expected to cost up to \u00a3400,000. </p> <p>Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, said: \"Wider use of digital x-ray vans will transform the old approach of mass radiography into a simpler, probably safer, more effective process.\" </p> <p>Experts say TB patients who reject or fail to finish treatment can cost the NHS up to \u00a3500,000 each; those with resistance to a drug might cost \u00a360,000; and even routine cases can cost \u00a35,000-\u00a36000. People with TB typically infect 10-15 others, and stopping just 25-30 cases a year might be enough for vans to pay for themselves. </p> <p>Sir Liam said the NHS must get \"back to public health basics\" to eventually eliminate TB, a scourge of the 19th century which has been rising in England since 1987, and is still one of the world's big killers. </p> <p>About 40% of cases are in London, seven in 10 people with TB come from an ethnic minority and two-thirds were born abroad. Too many people, including health professionals, assumed TB had disappeared, said Sir Liam. Others thought it was a disease to be ashamed of. </p> <p>Skin tests on asylum seekers in a pilot project in Kent failed to find active TB, but a voluntary chest-screening programme at Heathrow airport has identified cases. </p> <p>The latest figures available, from 2001-2, suggest that if 100,000 people arriving from high-risk countries and staying in the UK for six months were x-rayed, there might be 157 cases. In practice only 48,000 x-rays were taken that year. Similarly, for asylum seekers - 9,000 of whom were x-rayed - the figure might be 164 per 100,000. </p> <p>Ministers have been considering compulsory screening but TB experts point out the disease may not manifest itself for years. There may be new laws to compel patients to undergo treatment. </p> <p>Sir Liam said New York offered an example in successfully tackling TB, but there would be no new money for his plan, which required more co-ordinated services and better surveillance, diagnosis and care. </p> <p>If it succeeded, TB rates would decline by at least 2% a year over the next three years. </p> <p>TB specialist John Moore-Gillon, the president of the British Lung Foundation and a senior member of the British Thoracic Society, welcomed the plan but said New York had spent $1bn (\u00a3560m) tackling the disease. </p> <p>\"If we think it can solve the problem with cost-neutral reshuffling of resources, we are in for a shock,\" he said.</p>",
  "Tony Blair yesterday proposed a 15,000-strong European Union battle force, including British troops, dedicated to intervening in African conflicts and deployable within 10 days of a political instruction. He said the force should be ready next year. <p>Mr Blair made the proposal just 24 hours after the Iraq Survey Group reported that no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq. The talk of battle plans underlined the fact that despite the controversy over Iraq, Mr Blair has not lost his fervour for human rights-driven military interventions.</p> <p>The force formed part of a wider package to tackle the crisis across Africa, including generous debt and aid pro-posals designed to take the continent out of its cycle of poverty, disease and instability.</p> <p>The EU brigade, capable of more rapid deployment than any other multinational force, would intervene with the sanction of the African Union or the UN. The intention is that it would hold the line until an AU or UN force could be assembled.</p> <p>The force would be broken down into battle groups of 1,500 with bigger countries such as Britain, France, Germany and Poland supplying their own groups and smaller countries contributing to other groups.</p> <p>Such rapid action in Sudan might have prevented the refugee crisis and killings in Darfur in the west of the country. A 3,000-strong AU force, largely Nigerian, is still weeks from deployment.</p> <p>The prospect of British troops embarking on another foreign expedition was warily criticised by the Tories. Nicholas Soames, the shadow defence secretary, said: \"It is unfortunate that when the government is disbanding regiments and getting rid of manpower and capabilities that it should impose another task on our already overstretched armed forces.\"</p> <p>Donald Anderson, the Labour chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said in Morocco, where he will attend today's opening of parliament: \"There are dangers because of the fear of raising old colonial hackles again. The best thing we can do is not to intervene as Europeans but to help train African Union forces to take the lead themselves.\"</p> <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader who recently wrote to the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, suggesting that the EU rapid response units should be sent to Africa, said: \"These arrangements would allow for the kind of intervention we could all be in favour of.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair was speaking in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at the second session of the Commission for Africa, which is preparing a comprehensive plan on how the G8 industrialised countries and the EU can help Africa next year, which Mr Blair described as the year of decision for Africa.</p> <p>Mr Blair, speaking to a hall of leading African politicians and economists, said the drive to restore hope for Africa was \"one noble cause worth fighting for\" in an era of cynicism and disengagement from the political process.</p> <p>Explaining his plan for EU battle groups dedicated to the continent, he said: \"There will be times when Africa cannot stop a conflict on its own. Then the rest of the international community must be there to help. That is why I want Africa to be the top priority for the EU's new rapidly deployable battle groups and to get them operational initially as soon as possible in 2005.\"</p> <p>He added: \"These groups would allow the EU to respond to a crisis in Africa in 10 days.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair also revealed that Britain would train, directly or indirectly, 20,000 African troops over the next five years.</p> <p>He said the commission would report in March - ahead of the UK-hosted G8 summit in June. After publication \"the time for excuses will be over. The world inside Africa and outside will know just what the problems are, but also the solutions.\"</p> <p>The report is likely to call for multilateral debt to be written off, EU food subsidies to end and the international aid budget to double. Africa will be asked to intensify peer group review to stamp out corrup-tion and human rights abuses. Rich countries will be told to stop their citizens laundering money, selling arms and stealing resources in Africa.</p> <p>Mr Blair said a recovery for Africa was necessary to keep Europe secure. \"We know that poverty and instability lead to weak states which can be havens for terrorists and other criminals,\" he said.</p> <p>His visit to one of the world's poorest countries coincided with a strong attack on Europe's aid strategy from the chancellor, Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Mr Brown said Brussels should spend an extra \u20ac1bn (\u00a3691m) a year on low-income countries in Africa and Asia, calling it \"nonsensical\" that the European commission was focusing its <b> </b> financial assistance on relatively rich countries in the Balkans.</p> <p>The EU aid commissioner, Poul Nielsen, attacked Mr Brown's plans for an international finance facility intended to double aid by $100bn a year by issuing bonds in the capital markets using donor countries' long term funding commitments as collateral yesterday. He branded the idea Enron accounting.</p> <p>But Bob Geldof, one of the 17 members of the Commission for Africa, hit back. He said the IFF proposal was \"elegant, timely, simple and necessary\".</p> <p><b> Blair in Africa, page 4 theguardian.com/politics</b><br></p>",
  "<p>Tony Scott's yucky new thriller is a shrill and sentimental bloodbath: Pollyanna meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Denzel Washington plays a heavy drinking ex-soldier who snags a job in Mexico City as bodyguard to a little girl whose rich parents fear kidnappers. She's 10-year-old Dakota Fanning, a child actress so scarily self-possessed she makes Jodie Foster at the same age look like Bonnie Langford. Naturally, the little blonde mite redeems lonely Denzel with her artless charm, and when she is abducted by a coalition of barrio gangstas and corrupt cops, the great man hunts down everyone involved with one thing on his addled mind: to find out who was responsible by opening up a gigantic can of whup-ass. He tortures everyone from the minions to the kingpins, chopping off fingers, sticking dynamite up people's asses. This gets gratifyingly immediate and accurate intelligence, unlike in certain Cuban or Iraqi prison camps we could mention, and without Denz ever needing to hurt anyone but ugly and overweight bad guys. Scott's slick technique is overwhelmed by the sheer fatuous dishonesty of this macho quest. With magnificent effrontery, the final credits give a tremulous \"thank you\" to Mexico City for being such a \"special place\". It certainly looks like it.</p>",
  "<p>Pawel Pawlikowski exudes the confidence of a man who's conquered the town. And it's hard to say that his attitude isn't justified. His new film, My Summer of Love, has just won the top award at the Edinburgh film festival - and so did his previous one, Last Resort. Its entry into the lucrative North American market is assured after a screening at the Toronto film festival last month where it ended up the subject of a bidding war. Pawlikowski can afford to be satisfied. </p> <p>All this is a long way from the BBC's Community Programme Unit, where he started out in the mid-1980s. Pawlikowski, now 46, scratched his way into film-making by coming up with ideas for Open Space, the CPU's forum for public-issue rants. He came across a priest who was planning to construct a giant crucifix on the top of Pendle Hill in Lancashire. The priest told him he was doing it to counter the influence of local satanists; all he was waiting for was planning consent. Almost 20 years later, Pawlikowski giggles sheepishly at the recollection. His big break didn't work out as planned. For one thing, the priest never got to put his cross up. The local council didn't give him permission. But Pawlikowski made his film anyway; he had been given the money. Lucifer Over Lancashire turned out, he says, \"some scrappy thing\", but something about it stuck in his mind. </p> <p>By the time the draft script of My Summer of Love was finished, an extremely liberal adaptation of a novel by Helen Cross, a large chunk of the plot centred around a born-again Christian who wants to put up a giant cross. Since My Summer of Love isn't a documentary, Pawlikowski could arrange things so that his revivalist character actually gets the job done - even if it all happens over the county border in west Yorkshire. So, for a while in the summer of 2003, a giant cross stood tall over the small town of Bacup. Some things just work out. </p> <p>Since that \"scrappy thing\", Pawlikowski has emerged as one of Britain's most influential and important film-makers. After making a string of prize-winning documentaries in the late 1980s and 1990s, Pawlikowski achieved extraordinary success with Last Resort in a crossover into the land of fiction film-making. It's somehow ironic that one of our leading cinematic lights was actually born and brought up in Poland, only coming to the UK as a 15-year-old with his mother after his parents' marriage broke down. Even so, he used the name \"Paul\" on all his film credits, only reverting to Pawel for Last Resort. It seems an almost redundant observation to say that, via his Polish upbringing, Pawlikowsky has access to a film-making tradition at least as vital, if not more so, than that of his adopted home. </p> <p>Now, he says, he can see a continuity between his fiction and non-fiction films. The documentaries he made, mostly under the aegis of the BBC's Bookmark programme, used literary subjects as a cloak to investigate and satirise burning social and cultural issues - mostly following his interest in eastern Europe and Russia. Probably the best known is Serbian Epics, an account of the revival of Serbian oral poetry that took Pawlikowski and crew to the front lines of the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian civil war in 1994. Another success was Dostoevsky's Travels, a remarkable film about the novelist's grandson, whose primary goal while on a lecture tour of Germany is to get hold of a Mercedes and drive it back east. </p> <p>\"The documentaries I made were never normal documentaries,\" says Pawlikowski now. \"They were about subjects I was obsessed with, and I suppose I thought I could sculpt them. What I think I do with my fiction is the same. You take raw materials, a story that you emotionally connect with. And you put materials together that you like: landscape, character, location. Then you start sculpting with the help of a great director of photography and actors.\" </p> <p>\"I always thought that life is full of stories and characters that feel like literary stories and characters. So when I started making documentaries, they weren't humble empirical things, just following people around. I was always trying to impose a story.\" </p> <p>If he managed to find a niche for himself at the BBC - though call him a \"BBC documentarist\" at your peril - Pawlikowski's unashamed literary instincts have encountered more resistance in the cut-throat world of commercial feature film making. \"A good script is like a work of art in itself,\" he says. \"I've read hundreds of scripts, and good ones are very rare. If the writer has something to say, and a voice, and a plot that matches character, and an emotional trajectory that works, then I'd be an idiot to fool around with it. It's just that few scripts ever are like that. Most scripts are just cliches building on cliches to get from A to B. That sort of script I can write myself.\" </p> <p>It's this impatience with standard film-making practices that has created Pawlikowski's reputation for unconventional working methods - a brew of on-the-spot improvising, ceaseless rewriting, and instinctive decision-making. Pawlikowski's \"method\" is responsible for, among other things, the strong, heartfelt performances, and the inspired exploitation of apparently humdrum backdrops in both Last Resort and My Summer of Love. Pawlikowski himself characterises the way he goes about things as \"like total football - whatever works\". There is an intense period of actor workshopping involved, he says, but he hates the idea of being likened to Mike Leigh. He doesn't work to a set script, but bridles at the idea that he's looking to create some kind of down-and-dirty realism. </p> <p>\"The only reason I keep things open, and try not to pin people down to specific text, is to keep some kind of life on screen. Because what's so horrible in movies is the sense of deadness about the dialogue and the scene. I'm not doing it for authenticity; in fact, I'm aspiring to a more unreal and dreamlike state. I think, as an artist, you should try to achieve something that feels like good literature, but not by literary means. I dread to be compared to all these directors who have a lot of spontaneous emoting and swearing in their films - that is death, it's a cul-de-sac, it doesn't lift the material at all. It's just a cliched reproduction of what we think is normal behaviour.\" </p> <p>It's here that Pawlikowski sounds most Polish, talking hyperactively about the cut and thrust of ideas inside his work. Brits just don't say these sort of things. In any conversation with Pawlikowski, you soon realise that the word \"cliche\" - and his hatred of it - is a big part of his world. Presumably that's why he turned away from the kind of ripped-from-the-headlines topicality of Last Resort and its asylum-seekers, towards the story of a love affair between two teenage girls in smalltown west Yorkshire. For My Summer of Love, he cast two relative unknowns in the lead roles, alongside his Last Resort star Paddy Considine (\"there's something absolutely magnetic about him, a presence, strength\"). Warming to his theme, Pawlikowski starts talking about the importance of the actors in determining the nature of his film. \"The imagination goes into finding the right actors, so if they can create naturalness with an interesting personality, it won't be banal.\" </p> <p>Having such a unique directorial style has its drawbacks too. After the success of Last Resort, Pawlikowski was hired to make the Sylvia Plath biopic with Gwyneth Paltrow attached to star. Eventually, however, he walked out of it, citing the problems of dealing with a valuable Hollywood property's piecemeal schedule. \"Gwyneth was kind of tickled by my ideas, I think. She said to me, whatever works. But there was no person to play Ted in the time available. For a long time I was talking to the producers and they would say: we like your methods, do it the way you want - by the way, she's free in October, three days for rehearsal here, four days there, and we have to cast whoever's available in that period. I thought, this isn't going to work.\" </p> <p>But Pawlikowski has overcome what might have been a disconcerting, career-ending derailment. He's actually been here before: his first feature film, a hardly-seen 1998 effort called The Stringer (inspired fairly overtly by his documentary Tripping With Zhirinovsky, made three years earlier) was something of an embarrassment, not least for its leading lady, Anna Friel. Pawlikowski regained his edge by making Twockers, a TV film that harnessed the small-scale actor-centred style that was a prelude to Last Resort. </p> <p>Now that My Summer of Love has generated such a response, he can be generous. \"Paltrow, she's a good actress. If pushed, she could be really good. Some of the scenes in the film are really good. But she needed a strong man to pin her down, to scare her. If there'd been a really good couple around, like Burton and Taylor, then it could have worked. You need a sense of reality about a relationship rather than just acting out a script. It's so hard to find a big man, a man's man nowadays. That's why I did My Summer of Love: girls are the new men.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> My Summer of Love screens at the Odeon West End, WC1 in the London film festival on October 21 (box office: 0207 928 3232), and goes on general release on October 22.</p>"
