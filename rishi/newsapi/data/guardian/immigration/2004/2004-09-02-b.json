  "<p>Little more than nine months after Sir Clive Woodward guided his country to World Cup glory in the southern hemisphere he will start a new footballing life on the south coast following his shock decision to resign as England's rugby coach.</p> <p> At a board meeting today Southampton will rubber-stamp their chairman Rupert Lowe's proposal to hire Woodward in a managerial and motivational capacity, and the plan is for him to begin with Saints' first team as early as this month.</p> <p> In rugby terms, though, Woodward's new job could jeopardise his position as Lions coach for next summer. Woodward's precise role at St Mary's has yet to be finalised but his arrival will not affect Steve Wigley, the first-team coach. While Wigley will continue to train the squad, the club is keen to draw on the World Cup winner's skill in areas such as man management, team-building, motivation and preparation. </p> <p>Woodward's work at Southampton will also not be full-time until he has served his period of notice with the Rugby Football Union but he is expected to have a detailed and regular involvement with the Saints. The 48-year-old, a close friend of Lowe, has made several recent visits to the club's training ground to study the academy set-up and coaching and has been at three of the first four Premiership games. </p> <p>In another dramatic twist last night, however, the Lions committee warned that it could rescind its choice of Woodward as manager of next summer's tour to New Zealand if his new football role takes up excessive time. John Feehan, the chief executive of the Lions, insists Woodward's resignation as England coach has \"changed nothing\" as far as the Lions are concerned. But he acknowledged the committee is watching any football-related developments closely.</p> <p> \"There is a lot of speculation about what he will do next but we can only react to facts. If something came up which interfered with Clive's ability to do his job with the Lions properly, we would have to consider it,\" said Feehan. </p> <p>\"Clive's preparation has been second to none to date and we are very happy with what he has put in place. The only thing which could affect his position is if he accepted another position which took up the bulk of his time, but from our talks with him that is highly unlikely to be the case.\"</p> <p> Woodward spent much of yesterday talking to various RFU officials, many of whom appear to have realised too late they were in danger of losing their champion coach. Legal arguments will resume this morning with the RFU insisting that Woodward has not formally tendered his written resignation, but it was clear last night that this England coach is not for turning.</p> <p> Swapping the flag of St George for St Mary's stadium will be seen as dubious in some quarters but Woodward is intent on a new challenge, having become disaffected with the perennial club-v-country problems which continue to beset English rugby.</p> <p> The former England centre is likely to play some part in training at Southampton, though he will not be responsible for matters such as tactics or set-plays. His task instead will be to work with the head coach, probably in analysing training methods and tuning players' mind-sets. </p> <p>Observers of Southampton's last home game against Bolton may well conclude Woodward needs his own head testing, although the flip side of the coin is that they could hardly perform much worse in front of their own supporters if they had midweek pep-talks from Muffin the Mule or Eeyore.</p> <p>There will be also be several coaches in the world of rugby and football quietly hoping Woodward's new venture goes pear-shaped in order to preserve their own specialist reputations. Credit is due to Woodward for being bold enough to take a big career risk but he can expect scant sympathy from his cynical peers if things do not go according to his visionary plans.</p> <p> His switch also brings to an end an epic oval-ball era at Twickenham. During his coaching tenure England not only revolutionised the way they played but enjoyed unparalleled success, losing only 22 of 83 games under Woodward.</p> <p> As well as the World Cup Woodward's England also won the Six Nations Championship three times, secured a grand slam last year and established supremacy over the traditional southern hemisphere powers. Since bringing the Webb Ellis trophy home, however, Woodward's star has waned. Five of England's last six Tests have been lost and the rugby community will not easily forgive him if his personal career ambitions end up affecting the Lions' preparations ahead of their eagerly awaited showdown with Graham Henry's All Blacks.</p> <p> The odds-on favourite to succeed Woodward is his lieutenant Andy Robinson, with Jonny Wilkinson almost certain to assume the captaincy. Last night, though, the RFU was still in a state of shock, dazed by the pace of events.</p> <p>All of a sudden English rugby is entering into a strange new PC (Post-Clive) world. </p> <p> <strong>Three coaches who switched to soccer</strong></p> <p><strong> Anatoly Tarasov - Ice hockey to football</strong><br> </p> <p> The legendary ice hockey coach took over the CSKA Moscow football team in the mid-1970s but the players failed to respond to his disciplinarian methods and he was sacked midway through his first season. Tarasov blamed the other football coaches in the league for plotting to have him dismissed and returned to ice hockey a year later </p> <p><strong> Roelant Oltmans - Hockey to football</strong><br> </p> <p> Oltmans won gold medals as a player at the 1984 Olympics and then as coach in 1996 before switching to football and becoming general manager of NAC Breda in 1999, where he enjoyed immediate success as they were promoted to the first division in his first year. Oltmans returned to hockey in 2003 and was appointed head coach of the Pakistan national team that finished fifth at the Athens Olympics </p> <p><strong> Jan Erik Aalbu - Ski jumping to football</strong><br> </p> <p> The successful ski jumper stunned his Norway team-mates earlier this year when he announced that he was craving a new challenge and took up the job as director of sports at the Norwegian Premier League side Stabaek. He has failed to make an impression so far with the club third from bottom and involved in a relegation battle.</p>",
  "Spanish women are the longest living group of people in Europe, according to figures from the EU's Eurostat department. <p>They live to an average age of 83.7, three years longer than women in the UK, whose average is 80.7 years. Men in Britain live to 76.2 years on average. </p> <p>A recent report by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer suggested that Spain's excellent health care system and a diet with a lot of olive oil and red wine were together responsible for the longevity of its people. </p> <p>Nature magazine reported research from Harvard University last year which suggested that two elements found in red wine and olive oil, known as resveratrol and flavones, may be the key to a healthier, longer life. </p> <p>Spanish men still come second to Swedish men in longevity, living 77.2 years compared with 77.9. </p> <p>Spain's improving life-spans, high immigration and numbers of children born to immigrants helped give it the fastest rate of population growth in Europe, barring Cyprus, last year.</p>",
  "I always know there has been a terrorist incident in southern Israel when the helicopters start arriving at the regional hospital opposite my place of work. This time I didn't need to wait for the helicopters: Tuesday's suicide bombs exploded near enough for me and my colleagues at Ben Gurion university to be shaken by the blast. <p>It was closer to home in another sense: we were all aware that it could have been any one of us on those buses, popping out of our office to go shopping. And given that it was the last day of the holidays before the country's schoolchildren returned to their desks, we were all worried that maybe, just maybe, one of them was on those buses. </p> <p>Family and colleagues immediately got in touch,as did the foreign correspondents wanting to know more about this place which has, until now, been well off the map of terrorism. Beersheba, the normally peaceful regional capital of the Negev in the south of the country, has finally made it into the international headlines. </p> <p>Beersheba is almost equidistant between the Gaza Strip and the southern section of the West Bank, approximately 20 minutes' drive from each. In the past, when cheap Palestinian labour used to flood into Israel from the occupied territories, it was a place where the two groups of Palestinians met, exchanged information and disseminated their fight for independence from one territory to the other. But those days have long since ceased: today there is no more than a trickle of Palestinians allowed into Israel by the authorities. </p> <p>Israeli rightwingers, who oppose Ariel Sharon's Gaza disengagement plan, have used Tuesday's attacks as another reason not to go ahead, arguing that to disengage from Gaza would be equivalent to rewarding the terrorists. The fact that the suicide bombers did not come from Gaza, but from the Hebron region in the West Bank, is irrelevant to them. Any act of terrorism is, they say, an indication that territorial withdrawal will not bring an end to violence. And when the incident takes place in a major town so close to the Gaza Strip, this argument is strengthened. </p> <p>The lull in bombings over the past six months has been taken by most Israelis as proof that the security wall has served its professed purpose: keeping the bombers out of Israel. The proponents of the wall, which is still being built even though the international court of justice has ruled it illegal, point to the Beersheba bombings as further proof of its value. Why, they ask, did terrorism move southwards this week? Because, they answer, this is the only region where suicide bombers can still cross with relative ease from the West Bank into Israel. </p> <p>If anything, Tuesday's bombings will serve to speed up Israeli plans for the wall. It was reported on Ynet, the Israeli internet news channel, that Sharon undertook a tour of the southern parts of the West Bank last week to push ahead with the construction of the wall in this region, now that it has been completed elsewhere. When construction does go ahead, it will more closely follow the course of the green line. The few Israeli settlements there are more isolated and would not necessitate a rerouting of the border, as elsewhere. </p> <p>The idea that the wall - and only the wall - has brought about the lull in bombings is far too simplistic. There are a host of other reasons. International pressure on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to take a firmer hold of fundamentalist groups is of great importance. So, too, has been the impact of Israel's hardline military operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which have destroyed much of the military and civilian infrastructure, so much so that the situation for Palestinians is worse than at any time since 1967. </p> <p>Not that that makes much difference to some Israeli policymakers, who immediately after the bombings accused the Palestinian Authority of not doing enough to rein in the terrorists. The Israeli government is intent on discrediting Arafat, who is therefore linked to every outrage despite the fact that his declining authority has left him with little control over Hamas and Jihad elements. </p> <p>According to the biblical narrative, Beersheba was the home of Abraham, the common father to both Judaism and Islam. His name is often used to promote it as a city of peace and dialogue between the two peoples. But this week it became a city of violence and blood. It reminded the residents of this outlying town that the conflict does not bypass anyone. Hopefully, when the immediate - and understandable - emotional reaction has passed, it will remind us that peace, if it ever comes, will be for the benefit of all - not just the residents of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Newman is professor of political geography at Ben Gurion University of the Negev </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:newman@bgumail.bgu.ac.il\">newman@bgumail.bgu.ac.il</a></p>",
  "The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, called for a substantial and speedy expansion of the international forces in Darfur after reporting that the Sudanese government had failed to stop attacks on civilians. <p>He was delivering his verdict on Khartoum after the security council's deadline. He said that while the Sudanese government had made progress in some areas, it had still not fulfilled its commitment to stop and disarm the Janjaweed Arab militia which has been terrorising civilians throughout Darfur and bring those responsible to justice. </p> <p>\"I believe a substantially increased international presence in Darfur is required as quickly as possible,\" Mr Annan said. </p> <p>He also urged an extension of the force's mandate from simple monitoring the situation to patrolling the region. </p> <p>The security council discuss today whether to impose sanctions or allow the Sudanese government more time. The latter is the likeliest outcome. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said yesterday that Sudan had not done enough to disarm the militia which has forced up to 1.2 million people into refugee camps. </p> <p>He added that modest progress made so far had come about only \"because of the pressure exerted by the international community\". </p> <p>\"A culture of impunity continues, with no evidence that the perpetrators of these appalling attacks are being brought to justice,\" Mr Straw said. </p> <p>The Darfur crisis began last year when the government armed the Janjaweed to help suppress rebel movements. </p> <p>The African Union, the pan-continental organisation, has 80 monitors in Darfur and a protection force of 305 Rwandan and Nigerian soldiers. It has offered to increase this force to 2,000-3,000. </p> <p>The Sudanese government has not yet said whether it is prepared to accept such an increase. </p> <p>The secretary general, whose report was based on information from a UN team on the ground in Darfur, led by his envoy Jan Pronk, said: \"Stopping attacks against civilians and ensuring their protection is the responsibility of the government of Sudan. </p> <p>\"The government has not met this obligation fully, despite the commitments it has made and its obligations [under a UN security council resolution passed in July]. </p> <p>\"Attacks against civilians are continuing and the vast majority of armed militias have not been disarmed.\" </p> <p>The UN continued to receive reports of militia activity in all three states in Darfur, he said. </p> <p>Mr Annan said an increased international presence could help by decreasing the level of violence and improving the protection of civilians, particularly those in the camps. </p> <p>He said the Sudanese government had achieved \"some progress\" in making some of the camps safe havens and easing obstacles to the provision of humanitarian aid. </p> <p>The security council is unlikely to impose sanctions because at least four of its members - China, Russia, Algeria and Pakistan - are opposed. </p> <p>The US, and to a lesser extent, the British government, have been the two members most in favour of some form of punitive action. </p> <p>The British government will not make a final decision until it hears the views of the other council members, but is leaning toward the view that sanctions would be counterproductive at present and would divide the security council. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>One of the rebel forces in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Army, has released six Sudanese aid workers seized on Saturday.</p>",

  "The racing industry was preparing itself to face a betting scandal that stretches to the top of the sport yesterday, after police officers investigating allegations of race-fixing arrested 16 people, including the current champion flat jockey, Kieren Fallon. <p>If any or all are charged with conspiracy to defraud, the evidence against them will have been gleaned from phone records and computer databases, and not the fingerprints on a dope-filled syringe. Its impact on racing, though, could be more dramatic than anything that Dick Francis might imagine. </p> <p>Two more jockeys, Fergal Lynch and Darren Williams, were also among those arrested, along with a successful trainer, Karl Burke. Also detained in a total of 19 early morning raids was Miles Rodgers, a disgraced former owner who was banned from the sport for two years by the Jockey Club in March this year. </p> <p>It was the inclusion of Fallon among those detained yesterday that caused the greatest shock in racing circles, however, for all that his career has always veered giddily between peaks and troughs. </p> <p>Fallon emerged as a tough, uncompromising apprentice jockey in the late 1980s, displaying aggression both during and, on occasions, after a race. He was banned for 10 days in 1994 for hitting another jockey with his whip, and soon afterwards was so enraged by the riding tactics of Stuart Webster in a minor race at Beverley that he hauled him from his saddle after passing the post. He was banned from riding for six months as a result. </p> <p>His determination to succeed made him a firm favourite with the punters, though, and his career path turned sharply upwards in 1997 when he was appointed stable jockey to Henry Cecil. He rode his first Derby winner for Cecil two years later, only to be sacked by the trainer soon afterwards following claims - which Fallon denied - of an affair with Cecil's then wife, Natalie. </p> <p><b> Out of the saddle</b><br> </p> <p> The pattern of rapidly changing fortunes has continued for Fallon ever since, with six championship seasons in the last seven years punctuated by a near-fatal fall at Royal Ascot in June 2000 that kept him out of the saddle for six months. </p> <p>Fallon is currently awaiting a hearing at the Jockey Club on a charge of bringing racing into disrepute following an undercover investigation by reporters from the News of the World that was published this year under the headline \"The Fixer\". </p> <p>If he is charged with conspiracy to defraud following yesterday's arrest, one of the great postwar riding careers could be heading towards a miserable conclusion. </p> <p>Central to the evidence compiled in the case will be client betting records provided by Betfair, the internet's leading betting exchange. Betfair brings online gamblers around the world together at a single website where they can place bets and, crucially, accept money from other backers. </p> <p>Since Betfair's launch less than four years ago, it has proved wildly popular with punters, who will usually get significantly better odds than a backer with a conventional bookmaker. However, it has also faced persistent criticism that it allows clients with inside information - for instance, that a horse is off its feed, or recovering from illness - to earn easy money from punters who are not \"in the know\". </p> <p>Rodgers, another of those arrested yesterday, has already been banned from racing by the Jockey Club for doing just that. In March, he was found guilty of accepting bets on two horses owned by the Platinum Racing Club, of which he was a director, which were subsequently well beaten. </p> <p>Rodgers was later revealed to have also accepted substantial bets on a horse called Ballinger Ridge, which was narrowly beaten in a race at Lingfield in February when Fallon, its jockey, eased down prematurely and threw away a five-length lead. It is unclear, though, whether this race forms part of the latest investigation. </p> <p>Betfair's database logs and stores every bet struck on a given race. Paradoxically, this means the site could become an important new tool in the regulation of the sport as sophisticated software is also in place to highlight unusual betting patterns, for instance when a certain client enjoys a surprisingly high success rate on horses ridden by a particular jockey. </p> <p>The City of London police, who took over the latest investigation into alleged race-fixing after receiving information from the Jockey Club earlier this year, have a wealth of experience when it comes to analysing such data, and teasing out patterns that suggest collusion. </p> <p>The racing and betting industries must wait as the investigators sift through the evidence recovered during the raids, before deciding whether charges can be laid. </p> <p>The Jockey Club seemed resigned to the likelihood that Fallon's arrest would generate poor publicity for the sport in the short term. He is an immense figure on the British turf, and his association with fresh headlines involving race-fixing, regardless of whether charges are laid against him, is inevitably damaging. </p> <p>A high-profile trial which casts a light into some of the murkier corners of the racing business might also produce a number of embarrassing revelations. </p> <p>In the longer term, however, there is a growing belief that if the club is seen to be doing its job by rooting out corrupting influences, it can only be good for the standing of a sport on which British punters gamble many millions of pounds every day.</p> <p><b>History of scandal</b></p> <p><b> February 1998</b> </p> <p>Kieren Fallon wins \u00a370,000 damages after high court jury decides he had not conspired to cheat when riding Top Cees at Newmarket.

  "Nine books of \"maturity and accomplishment\" - ranging in theme from the story of Noah's ark retold with one-line postmodern jokes, to the Russian Jewish enclaves of modern Toronto - vie with each other in the opening stage of the Guardian First Book award today. <p>The longlist for the \u00a310,000 award, intended to recognise and reward writing by first-time authors, is made up of four books of fiction, four of non-fiction, and one volume of poems. </p> <p>Five of the chosen authors are British, two American, one Dutch, and one Canadian of Latvian origin. Their subject matter is even more heterogeneous. </p> <p>The fiction features stories of love and loss, magic and mystery, and the pain and joy of immigration, as well as the new take on Noah. </p> <p>The non-fiction looks at the intertwined lives of American writers, the reality of global warming, the genetic make-up of the human body, and a journey on foot across Afghanistan. </p> <p>The chair of the judging panel for the award, the Guardian's literary editor Claire Armitstead, said last night: \"We had a bigger submission this year than ever before - 145 books. </p> <p>\"Since we only allow three books per [publisher's] imprint, this gives some idea of how much energy publishers now put into spotting and producing new writers. In fiction, it seems to have been the year of old-fashioned narrative. </p> <p>\"Whereas in previous years there has been a lot of playfulness with form, this year's entry seems to show a return to solid, reader-friendly writing. The strongest sector was probably short stories, where there were three or four excellent collections. </p> <p>\"The age profile of the longlisted writers is higher than in previous years, which may account for the maturity and accomplishment of the books.\" </p> <p>The other judges include: the novelists Hari Kunzru and Ali Smith, the author and academic Lewis Wolpert, the barrister and cultural critic Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, the theatre director Sir Richard Eyre, the author and comedian Alexei Sayle, and the Guardian's deputy editor, Georgina Henry. </p> <p>Unusually for a literary award, readers' groups from Waterstone's bookshops in London, Glasgow, Nottingham, and Manchester will be able to affect the outcome. Stuart Broom, of Waterstone's, will represent their views on the judging panel. </p> <p>Mr Broom said: \"Involving our customers in reading groups actually puts them at the centre of the process of championing new authors. Readers involved in the 2003 award found it incredibly rewarding, and it was fascinating to note the differences in opinions voiced by readers of different ages in different cities which we were able to throw into the mix at the judges' final meeting.\" </p> <p>The shortlist will be announced in early November, and the winner of the prize in December.

  "<p>Mark Eitzel has a new hat. It's a really nice hat, he looks great in it, but he's more comfortable in the hat than with the compliment. The eminence grise of American independent music, a man revered by, among others, Coldplay, REM and Radiohead, a man whose laceratingly intense live shows (he will later only half-joke) invariably provoke reviewers to make reference to his \"rictus of pain\", brightens. </p> <p>\"I want incisive questions about glamour,\" he says, grinning. </p> <p>And hats? </p> <p>\"Hats! Yes!\" </p> <p>Between 1985 and 1994 Eitzel made seven albums as singer with American Music Club, many no longer available, though four - a faultless run from 1988's California, through United Kingdom (1990) and 1991's devastating Everclear to Mercury in 1993 - are masterpieces lauded at the time with rabid critical acclaim. One writer claimed, not unfairly, that a new American Music Club record was worth the entire output of the music industry. The band's intensely passionate muse made for emotionally eviscerating records, sometimes elegiac, sometimes furious, which now stand as a key influence on a subsequent generation of musicians reinventing the traditions of American songwriting. By the end, though, relationships within AMC were tense - as revealed in their patchy final album, San Francisco (named after the band's home town). </p> <p>\"The band ended after touring for a year and being broke,\" Eitzel recalls, wearily. \"It was sort of mutual, but like with everything else in AMC we couldn't agree on anything.\" </p> <p>Except disillusion? </p> <p>\"Except disillusionment, actually.\" </p> <p>Six Eitzel solo albums followed the band's demise, and a handful of unofficial releases. Eitzel's perennial discomfort and what he sees as his marginal status within the music industry are reflected in the titles of two of his favourite solo albums: The Invisible Man and The Ugly American. </p> <p>Now, though, unexpectedly, there is a new American Music Club record, Love Songs For Patriots - a scathing, literate, sometimes even funny collection of songs that stands with the band's best work. The reunion began when Eitzel, then living in Chicago, received a call from drummer Tim Mooney. He was one of AMC's earliest members, though he doesn't appear on record until Mercury. \"He had personal problems that made it inconvenient for him to be part of the band,\" Eitzel says. \"Put it this way, at the time he was a close personal friend of Courtney Love.\" </p> <p>Lonely in Chicago, Eitzel had flown to San Francisco for a party at his house there. \"My room mate was having a big blow-out,\" he remembers. \"A party I don't have to get home really pissed from - I can pass out there. Tim called and said, 'Why don't we try a song?' I said, 'No, let's just talk. Discuss.' I didn't want it to be the same. I showed up and Tim had set up a full drum kit, with microphones and Danny Pearson's bass already soundchecked. It was sort of like walking into the house of somebody you like but they wanna have sex and you're like, 'Oh, no! Eww!' </p> <p>\"We walked around each other for two hours,\" Eitzel continues. Finally, the ice broke and they recorded two songs. One, Another Morning, links love songs to a key figure in the AMC mythos, Kathleen - the woman with whom Eitzel, who later came out as gay, lived for eight and a half years. They sent the tracks to Vudi, the band's guitarist, in Los Angeles, where he now works as a bus driver. Vudi thought them, smiles Eitzel, \"demonstrably better than expected\". </p> <p>Although Eitzel had already written the songs before the reunion, Love Songs For Patriots is, also, demonstrably different from his solo records. \"It's not my band,\" he says enthusiastically, still palpably rediscovering the thrill of collaboration. \"I can't tell them what to play.\" </p> <p>The new album pivots around two extraordinary, characteristically unforgiving songs. One, Patriots Heart, is a brutal re-evaluation of what it means to be American, set in a run-down gay bar. \"If you wanna see something patriotic,\" Eitzel sings, half full of bile, half regret, \"there's a stripper ... It's so red, white and blue the way he works the bar ... \" The other, Home, an echo of the much-loved AMC song Last Harbour, sets a quest for love through a blizzard of self-loathing to surging, majestic chords. Eitzel recounts the song's genesis with a mixture of exasperation and elegant self-mockery. A journey from oblivion through anger and self-doubt to a kind of redemption, it is a quintessential Eitzel story. </p> <p>\"I used to go to bars every single night,\" he begins. \"I had a long period of denouement.\" </p> <p>Do you mean denouement? </p> <p>\"I mean decline. I have a friend who's a bar tender in a lot of bars, funnily enough. There's a bar called the 33 Hundred club, where old men go to die. I was an old man, and I went to this bar for my last drink at 1.30, before stumbling home at 2. I was staring at my last drink, wanting nothing more than to stare at it and drink and be an old man. This kid sat down next to me, very good looking but I don't care. He says, 'Hey, how you doin'?' Fuck. I would not look at him, but he would not stop. He's like, 'How are you?' 'Fine'. 'What do you do?' 'I'm having a drink.' He's an anomaly in this place 'cause he's under the age of 50 and he's not fucked up. He started talking at me, and I'm like, 'Well ... whaddyado?' Then he says, 'Well, I'm a deep psychedelic house DJ.' I said, 'Great! That's great.' I think he thought it would really blow me away, but I just saw his brain shrink to the size of a pinhead. He says, 'Have you ever heard of that?' 'Yes. No. I don't care.' </p> <p>\"I just wasn't being friendly enough to him. He said to me: 'You know what your trouble is?' I said, 'What?' 'You have to live with more love in your heart. I said, 'I really don't need somebody with some post-ecstasy revelation to give me some bullshit about what I fucking need or don't need in my motherfucking heart.' </p> <p>\"And he wouldn't stop. He said, 'No, really, you need more love in your heart. I have a beautiful woman waiting for me at home and we have great sex every night ...' And I'm ready to kill him! I didn't have anyone waiting for me at home and I just wanted to finish my drink. So I gave up. I said, 'You know what? Leave me the fuck alone, I just came in here to have a fucking drink, not fucking talk with you. And I'm sorry, but you're the one who started talking to me and this is what you fucking get. Fuck off.' And I left, and walked home, and I felt kind of bad, because he was just trying to make conversation at a bar, and I thought, the only thing left in this whole world that even bothers to hate you now is your pride, which was the start of the song.

I stumbled home.\" </p> <p>In truth, Eitzel is happier now, in an infectious, uncomplicated way, though his Italian boyfriend is likely to be deported soon by homeland security, despite being a homeowner and having lived in the US for 16 years. Though he's vitriolic about the injustice, Eitzel is pragmatic about the likely outcome: maybe, he says, actually quite relishing the prospect, he'll move to Italy. In the meantime, he is torn between promotional duties for Love Songs For Patriots and spending what little time may be left with his lover in San Francisco. </p> <p>Finally, too, Eitzel can openly acknowledge the worth of his songs. \"We're San Franciscans which means - and it's pretentious, it's a bore - that we believe that music is more important than making money, that creating art is the thing.

  "Thank you for coming. It's always a great pleasure to be here at Chatham House. <p>A year ago, Kofi Annan summed up what many were thinking when he spoke of the United Nations \"at a fork in the road\". There was a feeling that collective action had failed, and that the Organisation's future was at stake. On one side were accusations of unilateralism. And on the other was the conviction that our collective security was being threatened in new ways, with an insufficient collective response being offered. </p> <p>It was clear that we needed to build a new consensus. The High Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General has the task of proposing how that consensus might look; and I look forward to its conclusions. Let me offer some remarks today from a British perspective.</p> <p>In asking how the United Nations can adapt for the future, it is worth looking first at what lessons we can learn from its past.</p> <p>After the Charter was signed in 1945, the New York Times warned that it \"can be either the soul of a brave new world or merely a scrap of paper, depending on the will and action of its creators\". That \"will and action\" has varied over the UN's 60-year history. During the Cold War, although it did do some major work such as the resolutions on the Middle East, the Council was hampered by the superpower stand-off. In the whole period until 1990, it adopted only 17 Chapter VII resolutions. But today, the Council is the scene of remarkable international collaboration: it has adopted 24 Chapter VII resolutions over the last year alone. The UN's founders were well aware that they had not created an organisation fixed in stone: President Truman, at the signing ceremony, said \"no-one claims that [the Charter] is now a final or a perfect instrument\". But change has, in fact, come about not through revision of the Charter text, but by making flexible use of the instruments which it established. UN peacekeeping, for example, is nowhere mentioned in the Charter, but it has been one of the Organisation's great successes. Since they won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988, the \"blue helmets\" have helped to bring peace and democracy to countries such as Namibia, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique and East Timor, and continue to maintain stability from Haiti to Sierra Leone to the Ethiopia-Eritrea border. </p> <p>So its history shows that the United Nations is an effective tool for action when - though only when - its members have the political will to use it. And it shows too that the Organisation is a flexible instrument which is able to adapt - though again, it has done so when and only when its members have been willing to drive that change. </p> <p>The UN will need the same political commitment if it is successfully to adapt today. And it is vital that we build such a commitment to change, because the nature of the threats which we face has evolved, and because they demand collective and global responses.</p> <p>Today's threats are as likely to come from non-state groups such as terrorists and criminals as from states themselves. And they affect us all. The terrible siege at the school in Beslan, in the Russian Federation, shows again that terrorists are prepared to attack anyone, anywhere, without a shred of human compassion. The trauma for those poor innocent children is unspeakable, the anxiety for their parents unimaginable. Their suffering is our suffering. The awesome responsibility of President Putin and his Government is our responsibility too: first, out of simple human compassion and natural solidarity with the Russian people, whose sacrifice in the second world war helped secure our peace and future as well as theirs; but also, because this barbarism unfolding across the world's television screens is a horrible reminder that international terrorism is a present danger to all of us, wherever we are. The Security Council last night was therefore absolutely correct, in calling for the unconditional release of the hostages, to reaffirm that terrorism is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. </p> <p>It is not only terrorism within one state which has to be the concern of the international community as a whole, but other conflicts too. The situation in Darfur, from where I returned last week, demands action both because it is a human tragedy, and because it affects the whole region through the spread of instability and the movement of refugees. And in Gatumba, in Burundi, the horrific massacre a few weeks underlines the continuing potential of that conflict to destabilise the Great Lakes, and the challenges which the UN force there has to face. </p> <p>Those conflicts also show how threats to our security today are often linked to a range of factors such as the breakdown of order, poverty, disease, crippling injustice, environmental degradation and climate change. Unless we tackle such issues, we will not be able to build long-term, sustainable global security. The modern security agenda demands new and wide-ranging forms of collective action. And the United Nations is uniquely fitted to deliver them. The UN alone offers the global reach which is needed, and has the international standing and legitimacy to bring the international community together, developed and developing countries alike.</p> <p>It is beginning to fulfil that role. Over the past years, the Security Council has expanded the range of issues which it determines to be threats to the peace - covering the overthrow of democratically-elected government, terrorism, large-scale human rights violations, humanitarian catastrophe, refugee crises, and states which flout their international obligations on weapons of mass destruction. It has also considered uncontrolled small arms flows and the HIV-AIDS pandemic. </p> <p>We now need to take that evolution further, with the Council beginning to treat such issues more consistently, and as a matter of course, rather than in the relatively ad hoc way in which it has done so to date. That means that we need to continue to build a shared understanding of the nature of the modern threats to international peace and security.</p> <p>And alongside that, we also need to develop a greater consensus on how we can collectively address those threats. Let me highlight three areas for discussion.</p> <p>First, we need to be able to act earlier, as threats emerge; and our action needs to be sustained.</p> <p>To encourage a quicker response to emerging threats, the Secretary General could consider making more use of his power, under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring any matter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and security to the Security Council's attention. But no Secretary-General could do this in a vacuum, nor at the risk of being embroiled in an argument among Security Council members. So the UN's member states, not least the members of the Security Council, also have to face up to their responsibilities. Despite the warnings from United Nations staff this Spring of looming catastrophe in Darfur, and active efforts by the UK to draw international attention to the situation, it took the Security Council until the end of July to agree a resolution. Member States need to provide the UN Secretariat with the analytical capability it needs, and act on its warnings.</p> <p>We also need to ensure that international action is co-ordinated and sustained, particularly in post-conflict societies. Although the success of Namibia or Mozambique shows what can be done, countries emerging from civil conflict may relapse back into it within only a few years. Duplication of effort or competing programmes and priorities can be fatal to such fragile societies - if, for example, economic reforms cause high unemployment, and that coincides with the demobilisation of large numbers of battle-trained soldiers. So the United Nations needs to ensure that its own agencies work together, in pursuit of common objectives, with a clearer division of responsibilities; and it also has the wider potential to act as a co-ordinator of other international efforts and programmes. </p> <p>The second area which I want to highlight is the need to develop more effective tools for collective action. </p> <p>On terrorism, we need to maintain the recent momentum created by Resolutions 1526, on sanctions against Al-Qa'ida, and 1535, on the Counter-Terrorism Committee; and to put those Resolutions' objectives into practice. On the spread of small arms and light weapons, we should build greater international support around the UK's Transfer Control Initiative, aimed at securing agreement, at the UN Review Conference on small arms in 2006, to curb the export of such weapons to countries where they can fuel conflict or the abuse of human rights. </p> <p>We should also look to strengthen the UN's growing relationships with regional organisations. Chapter VIII of the Charter was remarkably visionary in nature, drafted at a time when few regional organisations existed; today, the Security Council could make more use of it. The UN has the potential to act as a clearing-house for the exchange of resources and capabilities - for example, facilitating NATO airlift support for an African Union operation, or deploying a European Union policing contingent as part of a force of UN-led peacekeepers. </p> <p>Perhaps the most sensitive question in the debate about the tools at our disposal is that of collective intervention in another state - including, in the most extreme cases, the use of military force. But it is a discussion which we need to have. </p> <p>A journalist [E.B. White] at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 wrote that underneath all the talk of collective security could be heard \"the throbbing of the engines: sovereignty, sovereignty, sovereignty\". There was no sense that the new Charter had removed the Westphalian principle of non-intervention in a state's internal affairs which lay at the basis of the international system. </p> <p>But equally, all members of the United Nations have accepted some limitation on their power to do as they please, in the service of collective security. It can no longer be acceptable to classify situations such as that in Darfur, or before in Rwanda or Kosovo, as simply the concern of one national government. States have the right to non-interference in their internal affairs; but they also have responsibilities, towards their own people, and towards the international community and their international engagements. Where those responsibilities are manifestly ignored or abused, the international community may need to intervene: the cost of failing to do so in Rwanda still haunts us today. So we are, correctly, not allowing the Sudanese Government to regard the situation in Darfur as a sovereign matter which is none of the world's business - but instead, we are putting pressure on that Government to meet its responsibility to provide security for its people. We are now giving active consideration to the Secretary General's report on the situation which issued yesterday.</p> <p>In the most extreme cases of crimes against humanity or humanitarian catastrophe, such as in Kosovo in 1999, international intervention may also have to include the use of military force. Such action will always be a highly sensitive topic in the international community, and rightly so. But there are some signs that a consensus is beginning to emerge. We need now to build on that - for example by restarting discussion on the basis of the guidelines for humanitarian intervention which the Prime Minister first proposed in 1999. </p> <p>And the debate is also evolving in the face of today's threats to international security. In the wake of the September 11th 2001 attacks, the Security Council recognised that large-scale terrorist action could constitute an armed attack that will give rise to the right of self-defence; and that force might, in some circumstances, be used against those who plan and perpetrate such acts and against those harbouring them, if that is necessary to avert further such terrorist acts. It was on that basis that the United Kingdom participated in military action against Al Qa'ida and the Taleban in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Alongside the debates on humanitarian intervention and action in self-defence, we also need to start building a consensus around the broad criteria for action by the Security Council against threats to international peace and security. We can build there on the growing understanding that these threats are wider, and different in nature, than before. On all of these questions and many others, the UN will be at its most effective when it promotes the widest possible international collaboration. So we also need to address the question of broadening the membership of the Security Council itself, on which the UK has a long-standing position. In pursuing that reform, we should be guided not just by a concern for representation, but by a recognition of the responsibilities which membership entails. That need not necessarily imply accepting specific military commitments. But it does require strong engagement with security issues across the board, wherever they arise. </p> <p>The third theme which I want to highlight is the importance of building the wider conditions for long-term, sustainable security. Let me take just two quick examples.</p> <p>The first is good governance. Well-governed, capable and accountable states are less likely to act aggressively, descend into conflict, or harbour terrorists and criminals - so we all have an interest in supporting them. The United Nations is well-placed to develop international norms on good governance, provide practical support for their implementation, and set up mechanisms for their review. And it also has unique legitimacy and expertise in spreading practical democracy. In Afghanistan, the UN's success in registering some 10\u00bd million electors has been remarkable. And in Iraq, the UN has a vital role to play in overseeing the political process. Just over a year on, the terrible and tragic attack of 19 August last year in Baghdad is still a painful memory for the UN's staff there, as it is for all of us. We and the United States are working closely with the UN to ensure that it gets the security which it needs to increase its presence on the ground, in order to offer the Iraqi Independent Electoral Commission and the Interim Government the advice and support which they have requested to organise successful elections. It is important that we do everything we can to maintain the time-table for those elections in January. And I welcome the appointment of Ashraf Jehnagir Qazi as Special Representative of the Secretary General, to lead the UN team in Iraq.</p> <p>The second example is this: The UN could do more to make development assistance more effective and better co-ordinated. It can help to push aid donors to greater generosity, and encourage recipients to spend aid more transparently and more effectively. As we have seen in Darfur, more could be done to improve the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system. The UK therefore strongly supports the Good Humanitarian Donorship process, promoting better co-ordination and prioritisation, and the more effective allocation of resources. </p> <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p> <p>Let me conclude with some observations on Britain's own role in shaping the United Nations' future.</p> <p>We have helped to shape the UN from its foundation. In 1946, London hosted the first meetings of the General Assembly, in Methodist Central Hall, and the Security Council, in Church House. Through our role in the Security Council and other UN bodies, our important contribution to the budget and to peacekeeping operations around the globe, and our strong commitment to an effective international system, we can be proud of the part which Britain has played in the UN's development. </p> <p>And we are well-placed to contribute as the UN adapts to today's global security challenges. Our armed forces are second to none, and highly adapted to modern, mobile operations. And we pursue a modern, active and wide-ranging foreign policy which helps to build the conditions for long-term global security and sustainable development. Tony Blair has convened the Commission for Africa, with the aim of putting the concerns of that continent back at the top of the international agenda. We will continue to lobby for the International Finance Facility proposed by Gordon Brown, which offers the potential of doubling development aid by leveraging the power of the capital markets. We will use our Presidency of the Security Council in October to lead work on following up the Secretary-General's report on Justice and the Rule of Law, an initiative which I launched during our last Presidency a year ago. And next year, when Britain holds the Presidency of the EU and the G8, we will have an important role to play in preparing for the Summit reviewing progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, and in following up the work of the High-Level Panel. </p> <p>Britain has as vital an interest as any country in a strong, modern and effective United Nations. We will remain at the forefront of efforts to build a new international consensus on the threats we face, and the tools which we can use, collectively, to address them. The UN's history shows a remarkable capacity to adapt and to realise its potential. We need now to ensure that it continues to do so, to address the security challenges of the next decades.</p>",
  "<p>The eminent American astronomer Professor Fred Whipple, who has died aged 97, was a world-renowned expert on meteors, meteorites, comets and planetary structure. During the second world war, he worked on radar countermeasures, and later served as a senior adviser to the US space programme. </p> <p>Over many years at Harvard, where he was professor of astronomy from 1950 to 1977, Whipple developed his initially controversial but now axiomatic theory that comets possess a nucleus, generally no more than a few kilometres in diameter, consisting of an aggregate of frozen gases such as the ices of methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water, and bonding a variety of rocky debris, including a large amount of dust and silica particles. </p> <p>This so-called Whipple \"dirty snowball\" hypothesis attracted savage criticism when it was published in the 1950s. At that time, the belief was that comets were nebulous orbiting clouds of dust and small rock particles - something like orbiting, if dispersed, sandbanks - whose changes of shape were largely determined by gravitational forces. </p> <p>Criticism was finally silenced in 1986 when the European Space Agency Giotto spacecraft penetrated comet Halley and photographed its cracked, rocky and outgassing nucleus, shown to be rich in frozen gases and in the form of an elliptical accreted mass estimated to be some 15km long and 7km wide. This was a complete vindication for Whipple, who had responded to his critics with characteristic rigour, patience and only an occasional mordant comment to silence his most aggressive detractors. </p> <p>One of the oddities of astronomy, and probably an indication of the difficulties involved in the study of comets is that, although their mysterious visitations and superstitious interpretations are dotted throughout the pages of recorded history, there have been very few theories of their origins or structure. Throughout most of the past century, comets were regarded as an area of investigation and discovery best left to diligent amateurs. For example, in the great popular classics, which stimulated widespread interest in astronomy after the first world war such as those by Sir James Jeans, comets are barely mentioned and no attempt is made to explain how or where they are formed, or what starts their extraordinary journeys through the solar system. </p> <p> T his exclusion ended in 1941 when Whipple, by then already an acknowledged expert on meteors and meteorites, published a new kind of popular treatise, Earth, Moon And Planets, focusing on solar system astronomy. This book rehearses the history of planetary astronomy and the many remaining mysteries, explains the basic techniques, and reviews recent discoveries in a form in which mathematics are minimised. </p> <p>In 1949 Whipple published his proposal that comets are made of the same materials as the outer planets, aggregates of ice and rock. This was buttressed in 1951 by the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort, who pointed out that a substantial amount of material left over from the formation of the planets is now dispersed in a huge belt of asteroids which, although in solar orbit, is about a light year from the sun. Gravitational perturbations would result in a few of these small masses being shunted either out of solar orbit altogether, to become wanderers in space, or into the solar system, where they could either be captured to become periodic comets or perhaps to be seen only once as they pass through on an extra-solar trajectory. </p> <p>Whipple developed these ideas, eventually explaining slight variations of cometary orbits through the propulsive forces of outgassing jets at the surface of the nucleus (actually seen by spacecraft Giotto), confirming the \"tail\" as a product of the solar wind and attributing the short survival of near-sun comets to their icy structure. He also promoted the development of meteor tracking systems, and investigated and helped to develop the role of radio astronomy in planetary studies. Supported by observations from around the world, including Jodrell Bank, Whipple showed that the majority of meteors visible from earth originate within the solar system and are produced predominantly from the break-up of comets. </p> <p>He carried out this work as director of the Smithsonian Institute Astrophysical Observatory from 1955 to 1973, and then as senior scientist there until his death. His appointment coincided with the start of the space age, and he anticipated the advent of artificial earth satellites by developing a tracking system. </p> <p>When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in October 1957, Whipple's network of amateur astronomers was the only group already set up to follow its progress, and he later co-ordinated an optical system using Baker-Nunn cameras. This worked so well that astronomers could calculate the exact shape of the Earth from the effect of gravity on satellite orbits. </p> <p> B orn of country stock in Red Oak, Iowa, Whipple spent the first 15 years of his life on a farm but, because of his special abilities, was taken by his parents to California, where got a degree in mathematics at the University of California at Los Angeles. He carried out graduate and postgraduate work at Berkeley and the Lick Observatory, receiving his doctorate in 1931. He became a member of staff at the Harvard College Observatory, where he found the freedom to pursue his studies of meteors. </p> <p>Eventually, he became chairman of the department of astronomy (1949-56), and ultimately Phillips professor of astronomy (1968-77). After retirement, he continued as professor emeritus, cycling to the observatory six days a week until he was 90. </p> <p>At the office of scientific research and development within the Harvard radio research laboratories from 1942 to 1945, he directed the American programme for the development, production and operational use of \"confusion reflectors\", the strips of reflecting aluminium dropped from aircraft to disable enemy radar. In 1946, back at Harvard Observatory, he began his crucial studies of comets and embarked on a lifelong involvement in civil space science as an adviser to the US government and to Nasa. </p> <p>In spite of his scientific rigour, Whipple's huge enthusiasm for space flight and for science fiction did not always endear him to more conventional astronomers, yet, toward the end of his life, he was able to declare himself delighted to have lived through a period during which science fiction had, in many respects, become reality. One disappointment was the inability of Nasa, because of reduced funding, to carry out the programme of cometary investigation that he was heavily involved in planning. He won a vast array of international awards, including the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and, in 1963, the Distinguished Federal Civilian Service award from President Kennedy. </p> <p>In 1928 he married Dorothy Woods, with whom he had a son, who survives him. They divorced in 1935, and in 1946 he married Babette Samelson. She, too, survives him, as do their two daughters. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fred Lawrence Whipple, astronomer, born November 5 1906; died August 30 2004 This obituary has been revised and updated since the writer's own death in 1998.</p>",
  "<p>What is Apple trying to tempt us with this time? A glamorous new wireless desktop computer as skinny as a catwalk model, as minimal as a John Pawson flat, that's what. For those of you working at home, the iMac G5, launched in a whirl of dry-ice publicity in Paris this week, will allow you to say farewell to dog/cat/toddler-trips-over-cable misery as you hurry to meet deadlines. Or it might be used to impress green-faced office colleagues stuck in front of antique Anglepoise-style iMac computers dating all the way back to 2002. As for those still cranking out their work on the first generation of multi-coloured translucent iMacs of 1998: they are dismissed to the outer realms of the electronic ether. </p> <p>The latest iMac, designed by Apple's relentlessly award-winning Jonathan Ive in his Silicon Valley studio, is not just good-looking, with every accessory you could possibly need packed inside its two-inch-deep, 17 or 20-inch wide screen; it has a memory approximately a million times greater than the very first generation of home computers beginning with the MITS Altair 8800 that went on sale in the US, in kit form, priced $395, in January 1975. </p> <p>That machine looked like a leftover from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the sort of anonymous box of electronics that you find dumped in canals. But, it could be used at home - a giant leap for the computer - and was tiny compared to the cabinet-sized IBM machines that looked like giant tape-recorders. </p> <p>Steve Wozniak's Apple 1 made its tenuous debut at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California in April 1976. It represented a revolution-in-the-making, but, clad in timber, looked like a component from a 1930s telephone exchange, and made a Louis XV chair look positively hi-tech. Teamed up the following year with Steve Jobs on the prototype Apple II, Wozniak approached Jim Warren at the first of his West Coast Computer Fairs. Housed in a beige plastic case, Apple II boasted such highly desirable refinements as a built-in keyboard and coloured graphics. When the two Steves offered a sceptical Warren a share in their new company for space at the fair, he shook his head. That headshake cost Warren a fortune. </p> <p>Apple blossomed. Its 1984 Macintosh became a darling of the design and publishing industry. Beige, upright and boxy, and very, very slow compared to the Apples and PCs we are used to now, it marked the beginning of the clear-cut divide between Apple and the rest. </p> <p>Increasingly aware of the marketing power of chic, as opposed to purely practical design, Apple had Ridley Scott direct its TV and cinema ads that year, and then, bit by megabyte, began to shape a new generation of machines calculated to appeal to graphic designers, product designers, architects and, ultimately, to the design-conscious chattering classes as a whole. </p> <p>The British-born Ive brought real excitement to the design of desktop computers with the 1998 iMac. Brightly coloured and wired up for the internet, it adorned the desks of cooing designers and their groupies. In his book Electric Dreams: Designing for the Digital Age (V&amp;A Publications, 2004), David Redhead notes that even as Business Week magazine greeted the iMac as \"illustrating the company's gradual slide into irrelevance\", Apple sold 150,000 of the colourful computers on the first weekend they went on sale. </p> <p>Computers had finally adopted the sleek and even sensual styling of the best hi-fi systems and cameras. What had looked like inscrutable components from hard-worked laboratories or early Moog synthesisers were now consumer goods, lifestyle accessories, desktop fetishes to preen over and show off. </p> <p>Most PC users see their computers as hugely useful tools: they will tell you how many more functions, or how many zillion more gigabytes of processing power, their latest laptop has compared with an iMac G5. This, though, misses the point. Simplicity of operation aside, Apples relies on sheer style to sell, at a premium, in a hugely competitive market. Even though products such as the iMac and iPod have widened the appeal of Apple and boosted sales to new heights, the company has just 3% of the global PC market, down from 5% five years ago. As Jobs told Time magazine in 2000: \"Victory in our industry is survival.\" </p> <p>Ive and his team are already well advanced on the design of the next generation of Apple computers. How they will look is, inevitably, a closely guarded secret. They could, of course, look like anything. Why not abandon minimalist, silver-sheen chic and produce a desktop that can be packaged and repackaged in any number of styles to suit fans of Gothic, Greek, Bauhaus, or deconstructivist styles? Office managers would have a fit, of course, because theirs, for the most part, is a world of the IBM-style neatness of 40 years ago. </p> <p>This is the very world the miniature computer has helped so many people escape, to set up on their own, to gain control over their own destinies, and perhaps why Apple has made a design fetish out of its desktop and laptop computers. Not only can they look good at home but, plugged into the world, with your choice of music, you feel, if only fleetingly, master or mistress of your universe. </p> <p>Apple's computers are an attempt to create a little piece of perfection in an imperfect world. It can never win, of course, and gradgrind PCs will continue to dominate the market, but as the latest iMac shows, Apple simply can't help but keep trying to lead us into electronic temptation.</p>",
  "<p>An epic journey isn't a thing of a few days; epic doesn't really happen in a van. And yet even driving north to the Torres del Paine national park in Patagonia has something of the epic about it: the enormous, empty landscapes, occasional swirling condors and the glimpses of the extraordinary granite peaks of the Torres themselves. </p> <p>Like the Mordor of Tolkien's Middle Earth, these enormous rocks begin to loom larger and larger as our journey progresses: three fat dark fingers pointing vertically skywards out of the middle of a snowy mountain range. We stop every hour or so for a view, as some new and nearer vista opens up. Long before we reach the official boundary of the national park, we assume we are clearly there, not having seen a soul for hours and having already taken a three-stage internal flight down past the Andes from Santiago. Even from Puerto Natales, the town described as the gateway to the Torres del Paine, hours of motoring up deserted roads remain. </p> <p>We break up this drive at the Cueva del Milodon: a gigantic cave where prehistoric remains were found in 1896, briefly sparking a yeti-style surge of interest in this mylodon, a huge bear-like beast of a sloth. It whets our appetite for strange animals, and by the time we do reach the edge of the park and see something furry with a hump, everyone leaps out in excitement. </p> <p>\"Guanaco!\" We give chase, camera lenses pointing, to the poor creature, something between a llama and a deer - much to the amusement of our guide, Cris, who explains that these are as common as sheep. It's true: by day two, we're thoroughly bored of them. Even a sheep would be a change. </p> <p>That said, there are also rhea in abundance, which look a bit more exotic, and huge condors. We don't see a puma, although we do see some worried guanacos charging around, which according to Cris, means big cats nearby. And we nearly run over a skunk. </p> <p>Short of time, we barely leave the van as we try to get around the park's highlights: a blue lake, a mirror lake, waterfalls, more lakes, and viewpoints. In fact, we're pretty much in permaview mode here, because it's never less than spectacular. In this region, the ground shifts rapidly: from grassland to scrub, from scree to the granite horns and snowy peaks of the Paine range at the centre of it all.</p> <p>Our lodgings' immediate landscapes are comparatively benign, perhaps due to the lea of the slopes that surround them: first the Hosteria Las Torres de la Patagonia, a newish, expansive hotel; and then the Mirador del Payne, a hotel-cum-estancia that has been in the Estrada family since the 1920s. The latter has the authentic call of the wild all over it, and after a hospitable evening on red wine and the national drink, pisco sours, I summon up the bravado to promise to ride with their gauchos. </p> <p>The next morning, the lingering effects have me relaxed enough to get in the saddle. It's my first time on the back of a horse, and I'm thrilled to get the thing to go in the right direction and not too fast, either. We amble along on the flat to round up some sheep, with dogs in pursuit. </p> <p>Up ahead, I see the gaucho - all pink shirt, cravat, and beret - turn round and say something to a Chilean friend, who looks at me and laughs. Someone later translates: my horse is known as the Borracho, one that learned to go so slow that even its drunken first owner could ride comatose and arrive home safely. </p> <p>More able riders could do longer treks, which would beat the van for a way of speedy sightseeing. But if time, commitment and mobility are no problem, this has to be a place to see on foot: there isn't a view in the world that isn't improved by having had to work for it. Marked circuits of the park can be done in five days (see below). Yet the weather - clear and perfect though it is on our visit - is liable to change rapidly, locals warn, making these potentially arduous treks. </p> <p>We only manage one walk, on a crisp, sunny day, bathed in clear light and fresh air tinged with wild rosemary. The hour or three's stroll starts at a waterfall throwing up rainbows, continues through paths worn into the prickly green undergrowth, the mata espinoza. We pass a small, idyllic lagoon, where the pebbles on the shore have arranged themselves flat into natural crazy paving, to end looking over a huge lake, face on to the Torres. The dark cliffs below them echo our calls back from hundreds of metres away.</p> <p>Whatever the method of travel, no one should miss the Grey Glacier. From the southern approach to Lago Grey, the glacier itself is a distant part of the panorama, though even from here its huge mass is impressive. In its countless millennia of advance and retreat, it has sculpted out a magnificent scene. We arrive at one end of a wide glacial moraine, a sweeping expanse of flat shingle whose dimensions are barely evident at first glance, until you make the long walk across it and chart your slow progress. </p> <p>And then the lake itself: still, glittering and decorated with fabulous icebergs, from car-sized frozen chunks to mammoth blocks whose visible tips alone would tower over houses: all in bizarre shapes, honed by the winds, blue-hued, with features like peepholes or hanging branches. Occasionally we hear a crash as part of one melts away and changes position in the water. For now, there is plenty more ice waiting to break away and float across the lake to this strange gallery.</p> <p>A path leads up a rock face to a vantage point above. It's a clearly marked route, and with a half dozen other visitors around, almost crowded for this part of the world.</p> <p>Returning to the water's edge, Cris produces a bottle of ready-made pisco sour from his bag. We scoop ice straight from the lake into our cups, and drink an early-evening cocktail to this vast, incredible landscape. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Gwyn Topham travelled to Chile with <a href=\"http://www7.lanchile.com/english/un/index-ie.htm\"> LanChile</a>, the national carrier.

  "<p>At 67, Anita Desai says she is becoming something of a drifter. She didn't leave India until she was 45, but now lives between Boston, Mexico, Cambridge and Delhi. She visits India less and less, just once a year, and \"briefly\" at that. \"Modern-day India is slipping away from me,\" she says. </p> <p>At an age when most writers are descending deeper into their own fictional worlds, into meditations on age, identity and the bankruptcy of the modern world, Desai is exploring lives increasingly remote from her own. Her new novel The Zigzag Way is set in Mexico and Cornwall, and is narrated by a young American writer, a man, who travels to the Sierra Madre without really knowing why. Desai says that this is more and more her own experience. \"There are two ways of travelling: there is the stumbling, directionless kind, and there is the more efficient sort, where you know exactly where you are going and how long it will take. But I think most things in my life have come about through chance, through serendipity.\" </p> <p>She is an unlikely-looking chancer, in her black and white sari and black jacket, her grey hair neatly tied back and a handbag over one shoulder. At the Edinburgh book festival last week, she came on stage carrying a couple of plastic bags and fidgeted with her handkerchief and several bookmarks during her introduction - but if she seems shy and self-effacing, you shouldn't mistake this for weakness of character. She is fiercely bright, extremely well read and has a neat way of unpicking a bad question from the audience. \"She has this absolutely steely core,\" says Alison Samuel, her editor. \"She doesn't suffer fools, I think, but she does it with such grace.\" </p> <p>The idea for the new novel grew out of Desai's passion for Mexico. She first went there six years ago, during a particularly cold New England winter, and immediately felt its affinity with India. \"It's such an ancient country, you feel every stone has a history to tell. Mexico and India share a history of colonialism - 300 years of Spanish and British rule - along with this much, much longer past that goes back into myth. Physically, we're alike, too: I am constantly taken for a Mexican.\" The novel focuses on the history of Mexico's silver mines, which for a time employed large numbers of Cornish miners. The places they lived in are now ghost towns, and the only signs they were ever there are the local pasties, and a rumour that the Cornish brought football to Mexico. </p> <p>Desai wrote the novel over several years, in breaks from teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, often sharing a house with her youngest daughter, Kiran, who is also a writer. (Kiran Desai's first novel, Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard, won a Betty Trask award in 1999, and she has just completed a second.) \"She works upstairs and I work downstairs,\" says Desai, smiling. \"It's a very good arrangement.\" </p> <p>The Zigzag Way is an unfashionably quiet, subtle book, in which history and landscape are more important than character and denouement; like many of Desai's books, it is open-ended. If the first rule of fiction is never to mention the weather or dwell on the scenery, Desai breaks it every time - but she manages to make them matter. \"I wanted to put Mexico in the foreground,\" she says, and the book is full of sunsets on purple mountains, lonely plains strewn with volcanic rubble, the silhouettes of twisted cacti, the air \"sharp as glass cut into splinters, flashing\". She has no argument with the modern taste for noisy, show-off fiction, she says - it is just not her style. \"I think writers have a duty to reflect the times, which are noisy, faster, wilder - but it's not my experience and I can't pretend it is; for some reason it always shows in the writing.\" </p> <p>In her fiction - 11 novels, two collections of short stories - Desai has instead explored the lives of middle-class Indians, the encounter between India and the west, and, in particular, the lives of Indian women. Her mother was German and her father Bengali, and although she was never discouraged from pursuing a career, she felt the options available to her were very limited; there was a strict progression from school to university to marriage and motherhood, with no break between. </p> <p>\"My older sisters both had careers, one as a doctor, the other as a civil servant, but I felt really there were few choices.\" She married at 20, after leaving Delhi University, where she studied English, and had two sons and two daughters. She had by this stage published several short stories, and still found time to write - although she has said that this work was \"utterly subservient to that of being a wife\". She was encouraged by her neighbour, the author and Merchant-Ivory screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who now lives in New York and so remains a friend and neighbour. </p> <p>As a young woman, Desai says she felt her own life was not big or broad enough to feed her writing. \"My whole life was about family and neighbours: it was very difficult for a woman to experience anything else. I was bored, and I needed to find more range, which is why I started to write about men in books like Baumgartner's Bombay [in which a German Jew flees the war in India] and In Custody [a college lecturer goes in search of a famous poet]. Men led lives of adventure, chance and risk. It just wasn't possible to write that from an Indian female perspective.\" </p> <p>In her 1999 novel Fasting, Feasting - her third to be shortlisted for the Booker prize - an unmarried woman is forced to care for her demanding, elderly parents, while her adored younger brother is sent to study in America. It is a brilliantly angry book, full of quiet rage about the pressures on women to marry and to serve (and, in America, to consume). In one brief, devastating scene, the cousin who won a place at Oxford but was forced to marry instead is wrapped in a nylon sari and set on fire: it is unclear whether she has committed suicide, or has been killed by her husband and mother-in-law. </p> <p>In 1990, Desai wrote a controversial essay for the Times Literary Supplement, A Secret Connivance, in which she argued that Indian women connive at their own subordination by aspiring to mythic role models, in the form of Indian goddesses. Desai says she believes that Indian society has changed since then, although not necessarily at a radical level. \"Women are now actively encouraged to work, but the reasons are chiefly economic - it is recognised that women have earning power, too. The pressure to marry is still huge, and so in some ways there are increased pressures.\" The American students she taught are no less obsessed by marriage, she says, but for almost opposite reasons. \"They are very much on their own from a young age, from the minute they learn to drive. And while Indian family life can be suffocating, the American family can be a lonely place.\" </p> <p>Desai arrived in America too late to catch the \"second wave\" of the feminist movement in the 60s and 70s, and left India too soon. \"I don't think feminism reached India till the 80s and 90s. Really it was something that affected my daughter's generation. Women were involved in politics when I was growing up because Gandhi and Nehru were keen that women be a part of the independence movement. These women were looked upon as heroines, but they were also great exceptions.\" She thinks Sonia Gandhi was right to have stood aside as prime minister after the Congress party's victory in this year's general election. \"It was a role she inherited and not one she chose. She would have been used as a tool by the party. The Gandhi-Nehru dynasty could have gone on and on for ever, but I think she was very wise to break it. And it's really magnificent news that a government I so much disapproved of has been voted out.\" </p> <p>On her annual visits to India, to see her husband and eldest son, Desai feels more and more a stranger. \"One likes to imagine that things have stood still, but so much happens. I have become an observer, and not a participant. And so much has happened to me that to them, my friends and family in India, I am becoming a ghost.\" She recently gave up teaching, \"because it required my best attention. I kept breaking my thread and it's a bad way to write.\" Home for the time being is wherever she can find the solitude she needs to work - Mexico, New York state, Cornwall, Cambridge, wherever. After all these years, she is leading the life she wanted for her characters, and which for years she thought could only be a man's - a life of adventure, chance and risk. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Zigzag Way by Anita Desai is published today by Chatto, price \u00a312.99.

  "Israel warned the Arab world yesterday that it saw Syrian hands behind this week's suicide bombings in Beersheba, as it sealed off a nearby West Bank city and destroyed the home of one of the attackers. <p>After the militant group Hamas claimed Tuesday's bus bombings, which killed 16 people, troops entered Hebron and blew up the home of Ahmed Kawasmeh, one of the perpetrators. </p> <p>Mr Kawasmeh belongs to a Hebron clan which has provided the city's mainstay of resistance to Israel. </p> <p>Later an Israeli missile hit a refugee camp in Gaza, injuring five Palestinians. </p> <p>But government officials said they believed that the threat was also coming from further afield, and hinted at reprisals against those supporting terrorists. </p> <p>\"The fact that Hamas is operating from Syria will not grant it immunity,\" Raanan Gissin, an adviser to the prime minister, Ariel Sharon, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>Shaul Mofaz, the defence minister, added that the events of Beersheba could not be seen separately from \"the activity occurring in Lebanon or Syria\". </p> <p>\"Hizbullah activity in Lebanon, with the assistance of Iran, as well as Hamas in Damascus, is very intense, and from there a large part of the attacks against Israel are launched,\" he was quoted as saying. </p> <p>In Hebron yesterday, ourners said Mr Kawasmeh's clan had lost 16 members in assasinations, shoot-outs and suicide attacks. </p> <p>Mourners from the family of the other bomber, Nassim Jabari, said they were proud that one of them had struck a blow against the Israelis. </p> <p>Mohammad Jabari, 62, an uncle, said Mr Jabari's activism was known to the family. </p> <p>\"He was questioned by the army but never jailed.\" </p>",
  "Tony Blair yesterday placed \"seven key policies challenges\" - designed to improve opportunity and security for all classes - at the centre of Labour's strategy for winning a third term. <p>He used a brief speech to party workers at Labour's HQ in Westminster to reject any suggestion that the government can campaign either on its record or on Conservative failings. \"The key to renewing our political support for the coming years is policy,\" Mr Blair declared. </p> <p>One No 10 aide explained: \"We want to keep up the momentum we had before the August break. It's policy that drives the politics.\" </p> <p>Explaining that economic stability, high employment, reformed public services and constitutional modernisation had been the main Labour challenges since 1997, Mr Blair listed the new policy areas: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> wider economic and educational opportunity for a \"larger majority\" as Europe faces growing US competition; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> personalised public services that meet higher voter expectations for health and education; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> doing more for the minority of poor people and neighbourhoods amid affluence; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> balancing tougher law and order policies with respect for civil liberties; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> promoting retirement \"as an opportunity not a threat\"; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> tackling immigration abuses while defending multi-culturalism against extremism; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> building international support for vital policies such as climate change. </p> <p>Mr Blair said: \"There is one key test that every policy decision should pass. Does it, in practical terms, advance and improve the lives of Britain's hard working families in the future? Does it help provide opportunity and security for them in a world of constant and rapid change?\" </p> <p>Though the prime minister offered no specific new remedies he promised initiatives in a dozen policy areas over the next six months - ranging from cutting red tape for business and better vocational education to universal childcare options for the under-fives and better pensions planning. </p> <p>Dismissing his critics as peddlers of \"the politics of pessimism and anxiety,\" Mr Blair twisted the knife in Michael Howard who was also in campaign mode yesterday. </p> <p>\"This responsibility to address the future clearly is ever more important to us as, frankly, the Tories flounder, incapable of the bold renewal, top to bottom, that their party needs. Only this party, Labour, is facing the future with confidence,\" he claimed. </p> <p>It is Mr Blair's conviction that the Tory leader is an attack dog without a strategic vision who is quickly coming to grief. Speaking during a walkabout in Hove yesterday, Mr Howard warned that politically correct attitudes and red tape are preventing the police from doing their job properly. </p> <p>\"We are told that it will take seven minutes on average for a police officer to fill in the forms, and we are not talking about stop and search here. </p> <p>\"We are talking about every time a police officer simply stops someone in the street and says 'what are doing here and where do you live?'\" Mr Howard said. </p> <p>It was Mr Howard's bad luck that he attacked Labour's anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) on the very day they were praised by the Daily Telegraph. Mr Blair, though not all Labour MPs, will take comfort from that.</p>",
  "<p>For some mysterious reason, I was not one of those asked this week by the right-wing thinktank Civitas to become a shareholder in its new model school in north-west London, an educational initiative necessary, in part, to stem the rot of a culture \"in serious decline - one might say meltdown\". </p> <p>However, as a long-time resident of the area in which the new model school will open its doors later this month, I did get its arresting yellow leaflet announcing its intention to set up a school promoting \"the values and knowledge on which the survival of the culture depends\" and calling for local support. </p> <p>Parents felt alternately intrigued and irritated. More than 100 people attended a fractious meeting in February, at which some dared to suggest that Civitas was playing on middle-class fears of the racial mix in local schools, the so-called \"playground effect\". In recent years, this patch has become packed with middle-class families, many of them staggering under the burden of high mortgages. But this is also Brent, one of the most multicultural boroughs in the country; inevitably, the schools reflect that. Civitas surely knew exactly what demographics, and what buried sensitivities, it was targeting with its offer of a \u00a33,000-a-year education based on \"Judaeo Christian\" values. A private education with moral knobs on. </p> <p>Despite that packed February meeting, the new model school has so far failed to recruit many entrants. According to news reports, only 10 parents have signed up. Hence, the need for this week's appeal to potential shareholders, and the warnings of imminent global moral collapse. </p> <p>One can only speculate why so few parents have taken up the Civitas offer; low-cost, \"no frills\" private schooling. But one answer may be a somewhat surprising level of parental support for local schools in Brent. </p> <p>Despite a significant drain to the private sector in this area and a never-ending debate about the problems of the state sector, there exists among local parents a sense that something really important hangs on the success of our local schools: social cohesion in the inner city, no less. One can sense in their attitude towards the local school something between a belief and a yearning for a sense of community, as well as a wish to come to terms with, rather than shy away from, the complexities of the modern world. </p> <p>Our daughters' school, a large mixed primary, is minutes away from the sports complex where the new model school will open its doors on September 13. More than 70 languages are spoken; new refugees arrive almost weekly. The 600 or so pupils come from every imaginable social, ethnic and religious background. </p> <p>In a funny way, our large red-brick primary is a kind of faith school, proud of its secular take on its own social and ethnic mix. Such a sense of excitement and celebration is perhaps easier to sustain at primary level, where the brute power and tricky problems of adolescence have not yet intervened. But where it works, a genuinely mixed, local school daily embodies the wish for, the struggle towards, fairness, tolerance and the chance of higher standards for all, not just those endowed with \"social and cultural capital\". </p> <p>Much of this depends on capital of the more basic sort: resources, plus a managing intelligence. At our local primary there is an on-site refugee centre, a strong behaviour policy, and a burgeoning sports and arts programme. There is also an active parental culture. </p> <p>Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world. But it is in the grind and pleasure of such everyday cooperation that the abstract value of community finds specific and positive meaning. And surely not just in Brent: such an experience is being repeated, largely unreported, in inner cities around modern Britain. I'm not sure what Civitas means by \"Judaeo Christian values\" but my re-readings of the Old and New Testaments find as much justification for the world view our school promotes as Civitas no doubt finds for the errors of mass migration or the moral failings of the divorced. </p> <p>Children at our local primary also get the chance to develop what Civitas calls \"social skills and good character\", only as well as traditional good manners they get a grasp of complex religious difference and the vast inequalities in the world we live in. What our school cannot offer is maths to an \"adequate standard for the Common Entrance exams\", French for the very young, and a reading age of eight by the age of five. </p> <p>I remain curious as to why so many undoubtedly anxious local parents have, so far, failed to take up Civitas's offer and why so many seem to have opted instead for the more complex and uncertain adventure of the local school, the noisy truth of community. </p> <p>Perhaps the playground effect works both ways; it is its thrill, rather than its threat, that has swung it for them. Like me perhaps, they prefer the prospect of lively collaboration, the chance of a range of unexpected friends and experiences, over the rigid certainties of 10 bent heads in a rented sports hall. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Melissa Benn is co-editor of a book of essays on education and democracy to be published by Continuum press this month </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mbenn@dircon.co.uk\">mbenn@dircon.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Searching for the lost Ark of the Covenant? Curious about the location of the Holy Grail? A nondescript street in west London may be the place to start looking. Like many of the most enticing headquarters, it's a public building: the old Post Office Savings Bank, where 7,000 clerks once toiled. Used as a set for the New Avengers, it now houses the physical legacy of Britain's march from the industrial revolution. <p>This is Blythe House, the archive of the Science Museum. The museum galleries that you can see every day are home to some 15,000 objects, with the same amount kept in the Large Objects Store, a warehouse near Swindon. But Blythe, behind the Olympia exhibition centre, is the motherlode: more than 170,000 items secreted on shelves stretching from one side of the building to the other , all neatly tagged, boxed and catalogued. And, from this week, the museum will take guided tours around the stores for the first time; we own the stuff, after all. </p> <p>Organising the four floors is Xerxes Mazda, 39, the museum's manager of collections access. There is no natural light. The windows are blocked off, \"so that we preserve the objects - preserve the temperature and control the humidity\", says Mazda, who handles everything, no matter what size, with a pair of white cotton gloves. </p> <p>\"Memory feeds imagination,\" said Amy Tan, and if a nation has a collective memory, this is it. There are things here that exist nowhere else on earth. </p> <p>Significant objects are everywhere. The aeronautics floor, among the copper-covered radar mini-planes and the ejector seats, hosts a collection of the wind tunnel models used during the development of Concorde, including a free flight model taken up by a helicopter. It is part of the enormous number of objects originally from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in Farnborough, where the problem of metal fatigue in aircraft flying at great speeds was discovered. \"During the cold war, Farnbrough had computers in advance of anything else in Britain,\" says Andrew Nahum, curator of flight. </p> <p>Opposite an unsettling rubber dummy used to test ejector seats underwater, hidden down an aisle, is a prosaic-looking piece of battered painted metal. It's part of the upper fuselage from one of the world's first commercial airliners, the De Havilland Comet. </p> <p>But this particular piece is from G-ALYP, which crashed off the island of Elba in 1954 with huge fatigue cracks around the automatic direction-finding hatches. It was the second to crash, and the entire fleet was grounded later that year. By the time the problem was remedied, the Douglas DC8 and the Boeing 707 dominated the air. It sits not far from the GPS unit of a chopper shot down in the 1991 Gulf war. \"All the things that are quite interesting always look like nothing special,\" says Mazda. </p> <p>There's the unexpected, too, such as the collection of lathes. One of them belonged to Charles Babbage, whose Difference Engine is regarded as one of the precursors to the first computer. </p> <p>\"Ornamental turning was carried out by gentleman amateurs,\" says Ben Russell, curator of mechanical engineering. Parts of the lathe were built by Babbage's engineer, Joseph Clement - presumably before the two fell out and Babbage refused to pay him. </p> <p>The store is also home to the Oxford heliometer from the Radcliffe Observatory, installed in 1848. Designed to measure the diameter of the sun, the split lens micrometer was adapted to make precise measurements of star positions using parallax motion. It was the first large example of this sort of instrument to be used in England. An individual telescope is a beautiful object - particularly the one stored in a glass case from the Royal Society mission to observe the transit of Venus in 1769. But the sight of a multitude of telescopes, amassed like the spiky office furniture in an Ikea furniture warehouse, is overwhelming, a monument to determination. </p> <p>Often the contents are odd. Deep in the bowels of the basement, among the surgical instruments that are part of the collection of items left by Henry Wellcome, behind the amputation kits and the tonsil guillotines (do what they say on the tin) are two drawers best described as items removed from the person. There's the \"ring removed from the penis of an idiot\" after 48 hours \"with considerable difficulty by means of metal-cutting forceps\" or the toothbrush \"swallowed by a male lunatic, 62\". It stayed there for 14 days until the patient underwent surgery. The label notes baldly that although the patient recovered, \"on being transferred to the Maudsley [psychiatric hospital] he cut his throat\". </p> <p>It's a museum of tragedy as much as anything else: the key example being the prosthetic limbs room, with its collection of first world war false legs, and a pair from 1977 designed for a thalidomide baby. </p> <p>The quantity is staggering. Not far from the dentistry room with its smell of mouthwash, collection of toothless skulls and dentists' chairs, there's a chamber filled almost entirely with forceps used by midwives, and another of shelves lined exclusively with pestles and mortars. In the x-ray machine room, there's a pedoscope - used in shoe shops for parents to see how their children's feet fitted their shoes. There's also an iron lung room. Iron lungs were the first life support system and helped paralysed people to breathe. They were widely used during the polio epidemic of the early 1950s, and some people had to spend the rest of their lives in them. </p> <p>There are grimmer discoveries among the dials and buttons of medical equipment here. On one shelf is a silver-coloured device which looks like a primitive stereo amplifier. It includes several dials on which a patient's vital measurements would be entered before a needle would swing toward one of two readings: \"survive\" or \"IBD\" (irreversible brain damage). Mazda points out that the \"London hospital survival predictor\" was never used to determine whether life support should be withdrawn. </p> <p>This is about how people live, and the collection reflects that. It is practical science: not the big developments, but the incremental ones that never make the papers. Mazda says: \"It says far more about the history of science and technology than it does about the science museum.\" </p> <p>Although most of the museum's exhibits are sought out, two or three pieces are donated every day. On receiving them, the curators compare them with their hitlist of items, and eventually the objects make their way into the galleries or onto the shelves at Blythe house. The museum has to be selective, says Mazda, as the process of deselecting an item is long and complicated. </p> <p>It is like an enormous junk shop. A drawer with a condom maker in it is situated near one with an ice skate made out of a sheep's jawbone. But if these items aren't saved here, where would they be preserved? The answer is that they would probably disappear forever. </p> <p>\"You can't put a dome over the whole world,\" Mazda says, wistfully. \"I wish you could.\" </p> <p>Further information about Ingenious: Tours of the Stores, a year-long series of curator-led tours, can be found at <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ingenioustours\">www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ingenioustours</a>.
