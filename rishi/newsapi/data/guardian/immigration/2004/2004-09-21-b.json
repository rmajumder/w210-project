  "The Guardian First Book Award 2004 longlist has been announced (for the full list see below). This year's list is as wide-ranging and eclectic as ever. The five fiction books feature stories of love and loss, magic and mystery, the pain and joy of immigration, and a new take on a biblical tale. The five non-fiction books explore the true nature of the Sicilian mafia, the intertwined lives of American writers, the reality of global warming, the genetic make-up of the human body, and a journey - on foot - across Afghanistan. <p>This year's award will be judged by a panel which includes novelists Hari Kunzru and Ali Smith, author and academic Lewis Wolpert, barrister and cultural critic Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, theatre director Sir Richard Eyre, author and comedian Alexei Sayle and Guardian Deputy Editor Georgina Henry. The panel will be chaired by Claire Armitstead, Literary Editor of the Guardian.</p> <p>Once again, the Guardian has joined with Waterstone's to give readers the opportunity to affect the outcome of the award by taking part in store-based reading groups in London, Glasgow, Nottingham and Manchester. Stuart Broom of Waterstone's, will represent their views on the judging panel. </p> <p> The Guardian First Book Award recognises and rewards new writing across fiction and non-fiction. The award, for first time authors, is open to books from genres including fiction, poetry, biography, memoir, history, politics, science and current affairs.</p> <p> Claire Armitstead, Literary Editor of the Guardian, said: \"We had a bigger submission this year than ever before - 145 books. Since we only allow 3 books per (publisher's) imprint, this gives some idea of how much energy publishers now put into spotting and producing new writers. In fiction, it seems to have been the year of old fashioned narrative. Whereas in previous years there has been a lot of playfulness with form, this year's entry seems to show a return to solid, reader-friendly writing. The strongest sector was probably short stories, where there were three or four excellent collections. The age profile of the longlisted writers is higher than in previous years, which may account for the maturity and accomplishment of the books.\"</p> <p> Stuart Broom, from Waterstone's said: \"Waterstone's is proud to be involved in the Guardian First Book Award for the second year running. Our customers are always passionately interested in the best new writing and involving them in reading groups actually puts them at the centre of the process of championing new authors. Readers involved in the 2003 Award found it incredibly rewarding, and it was fascinating to note the differences in opinions voiced by readers of different ages in different cities which we were able to throw into the mix at the judges' final meeting.\"</p> <p> The winner will receive a prize of \u00a310,000 and an advertising package in the Guardian and the Observer.</p> <p> The shortlist, of five books, agreed by the panel and the Waterstone's readers' groups, will be announced in early November and the winner in December.</p> <p> Guardian Unlimited Books, the Guardian's comprehensive books site, will carry additional interactive information on the Guardian First Book Award.

  "<p>Food and household products group Unilever yesterday shocked the City with a sales and profit warning that sent its shares down 7% at one stage. The setback ensured its high-profile co-chairman Niall FitzGerald will leave next week to go to news provider Reuters on a sour note. </p> <p>His successor - Unilever foods director Patrick Cescau - admitted that the Path to Growth strategy created by Mr FitzGerald to focus on 400 brands was \"not delivering\" the results expected. </p> <p>Mr Cescau planned to put this right by boosting marketing spending and by speeding up remedial action on underperforming businesses hinting that further failure to turn them around would lead to significant disposals. </p> <p>The owner of Dove soap and Hellman's mayonnaise said end of year profit growth would rise - not by more than 10% as it had previously de clared but by less than 5%. In Europe, it blamed bad weather for substantially lower sales of ice cream and ready-to-drink tea, and weaker consumer confidence for a decline in home and personal care products. </p> <p>In Asia Unilever said intense competition was continuing to affect sales in laundry and hair markets. </p> <p>All this would lead to a decline in gross margins during the third quarter compared with the same period last year and damage earnings per share (EPS) figures. </p> <p>\"In the light of the poor July/August and the pressure on some of our market positions we do not consider it in the long-term interests of the business to maintain our previous low double digit EPS guidance for 2004,\" it said in a joint statement from Mr FitzGerald and his co-chairman Antony Burgmans. </p> <p>Unilever's troubles hit the shares of Cadbury Schweppes and other consumer compa nies and encouraged Reckitt Benckiser, the world's biggest household goods producer, to reconfirm its financial targets. </p> <p>Unilever is to put more effort into the relaunch of Slim Fast products which have been badly hit by consumer interest in weight reduction products associated more closely with the Atkins diet. Slim Fast, frozen foods and the fragrances business are the three divisions that have been badly underperforming. </p> <p>Mr Cescau said a final effort would be made to \"fix\" these areas but warned \"if we don't succeed we have to look at other solutions\". Disposals were definitely one of the options, he said. </p> <p>Shares in Unilever recovered slightly as the day progressed ending down 22p at 459.5p but City analysts reduced their profit forecasts and changed their recommendations. </p> <p>Numis Securities cut its share price target from 510p to 400p and changed a hold recommendation to reduce.</p>",
  "Why don't Blair-hating Labour supporters like me plan to vote Liberal, as Charles Kennedy obviously hopes (Kennedy keeps door open to post-election deal with Labour, September 20)?

  "<b>Window cleaners</b> <p><b> Population:</b> Currently 80,000 in the UK, but under threat. </p> <p><b> Why?</b> Between two and seven window cleaners die in accidents each year, which has caused insurance premiums to double in the past 12 months, according to the British Cleaning Council. </p> <p><b> We have a British Cleaning Council? What does it do?</b> It is an umbrella organisation. Members include the Industrial Cleaning Machine Manufacturers' Association, the National Carpet Cleaners Association and the Worshipful Company of Environmental Cleaners. </p> <p><b> Quite an illustrious list.</b> The National Federation of Master Window &amp; General Cleaners is also a member. </p> <p><b> And what does the NFMW&amp;GC do?</b> Established in 1947, it protects window-owners against fraud and misrepresentation, and liaises with government bodies to improve the image of window and general cleaners. </p> <p><b> I imagine they're still reeling from that unsavoury George Formby peeping-tom episode.</b> It's best not to mention that. They also produce a members' magazine, Window Talk, and a training video, Walk Up, Walk Down. </p> <p><b> Not to be confused with the Bannister Makers' Association training video, Polish Up, Slide Down.</b> Absolutely not. </p> <p><b> So tell me more about window-cleaner extinction.</b> The law says that all firms must have employers' liability insurance. As this now costs between \u00a31,500 and \u00a32,000 for each employee, many window cleaners are having to go it alone, or worse. </p> <p><b> Worse?</b> Unable to afford cover, some are having to go underground. </p> <p><b> They won't get much work there.</b> Oh, please! Some are introducing new safety measures to get around the insurance premiums, such as ditching ladders in favour of water-fed poles. </p> <p><b> Ah, I knew it! It was only a matter of time before British window cleaners were usurped by a cheap, migrant workforce coming over from eastern Europe and asking for nothing but a couple o'bob and a cupful of water. </b> Not Poles, poles.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Boots</strong> was one of the worst performers in a weak FTSE 100 yesterday amid talk that next week's half-year trading update from the retail chain could disappoint. </p> <p>City dealers blamed the jitters on a research note published by the company's broker, Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>While retaining a buy recommendation, the US investment house said like-for-like sales growth in the core Boots the Chemist business was likely to fall 0.2 of a point shy of its previous forecast of 4%. </p> <p>In the note, Nick Hawkins, the Merrill analyst, said a number of factors were responsible for the new forecast. The first and most obvious was the wet weather this summer. The second: increased investment in pricing. </p> <p>Including special offers, Mr Hawkins believes Boots, which is in the middle of a radical restructuring, matched <strong>Tesco</strong>, off 0.5p at 275.25p, on price over the summer. He is not convinced that Boots achieved the increase in sales needed to pay for the offers and price cuts. He also believes the implementation of a new in-store merchandising system caused some disruption. </p> <p>Despite announcing the purchase of 300,000 shares for cancellation, Boots still finished 16.5p weaker at 679.5p. The shares have risen 100p since the start of May. </p> <p>Leading shares closed lower, dragged down by a weak opening on Wall Street and a profits warning from <strong>Unilever</strong>, 22.5p lower at 459.5p, which unsettled rival <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> , 21p lighter at \u00a314.11, and key supplier <strong>ICI</strong>, 5p cheaper at 211.5p. </p> <p>The final scores showed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> index down 11.5 points at 4579.5. Traders said the loss would have been greater were it not for strength in oil stocks <strong> BP</strong> and<strong> Shell</strong>. </p> <p>BP, the UK's biggest company, was marked 9p higher at 528.5p as City traders realised the company was able to resume its share buyback programme following a 30-day blackout period. </p> <p>BP was forced to put the buyback on ice ahead of the payment of nearly 105m shares to the partners of its Russian joint venture, TNK-BP. Given the strong oil price, German bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein expects BP to purchase about 5m shares a day for the rest of the year and possibly 10m a day in the short term. <strong>Shell</strong>, meanwhile, added 5p to 422.5p as dealers bet that the company would announce radical changes at tomorrow's strategy update. </p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 250</strong> index eased 18.2 points to 6277.9 despite good performances from its media constituents following confirmation of merger talks between <strong>Capital Radio</strong>, up 28p at 458p, and <strong>GWR</strong>, 24.5p higher at 287p. </p> <p>The <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index eased 1.8 points to 2,572.6. Market turnover was poor with a little over 2bn shares changing hands. </p> <p>In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 100.87, yielding 4,895%. </p> <p><strong>Compass Group</strong>, the world's biggest contract caterer, was the day's main talking point. Although it closed 4.5p weaker at 225p, a chunky 26m shares were traded amid speculation that someone is running a slide rule over the group, which lost 25% its market value earlier this month following a poor trading update. </p> <p>Dealers said the talk was of a bid from a private equity group. With a market capitalisation of nearly \u00a35bn, Compass would be a mouthful for even the biggest venture capitalist, though. </p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>Enodis</strong>, which makes catering equipment for the likes of McDonald's and other fast food chains, eased 4.5p to 85.5p on rumours that a profits warning could be on the way. </p> <p><strong>Big Food Group</strong>, the owner of Iceland and cash and carry business Booker, was also under pressure amid talk that Baugur was unlikely to bid 110p a share once it has completed due diligence. </p> <p>Given Friday's grim trading update and the fact that the company has a substantial pension fund deficit, analysts would not be surprised if Baugur revised its offer to nearer 90p. Big Food fell 4.25p to 98.5p. </p> <p>After the market closed, the company announced, at the request of the Takeover Panel, that it would recommend an offer of 110p if one were made. </p> <p>On a brighter note, <strong>WH Smith</strong> improved 11.75p to 325.75p after Deutsche Bank upgraded to buy and set a 350p target price. </p> <p>\"We believe the market is ignoring a very interesting management change story,\" Deutsche's highly rated retail team said. </p> <p>Among the small caps, <strong>NSB Retail Systems</strong> firmed 0.25p to 25.75p amid talk that rival <strong>Torex Retail</strong>, up 1p at 53.5p, is considering an offer of 35p a share. </p> <p>The trigger for the rumour was half-year figures from Torex which contained the news that the company would \"aggressively pursue\" its objective of becoming Europe's leading provider of software to retailers. Dealers believe a bid for NSB would go some way to achieving that goal. </p> <p>There was a buzz around <strong>Lavendon</strong>, the provider of powered access equipment such as scissor lifts, after two lines of stock - equivalent to 10% of the company - changed hands at 132p, a 9% premium to the opening price. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Lavendon initiated a strategic review following another poor performance from its German business. The shares closed the session 10p stronger at 131.5p.</p>",
  "1. Last night saw the premiere of <a href=\"http://www.uip.co.uk/wimbledon/wimbledon.html \">Wimbledon</a>, starring American golden girl Kirsten Dunst and British actor Paul Bettany. They form a romantic mixed-double in this comedy about two tennis players who fall in love while competing for the coveted <a href=\"http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/index.html\">Wimbledon</a> trophy. <p>2. Tennis is fast becoming a popular sport among filmmakers. A new film called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413356/&quot;\">Tennis, Anyone?</a> will soon be released featuring the much-adored ER star <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001864/\">Noah Wyle</a>.</p> <p>3. Football and film are deeply embedded parts of British culture and over the years a number of filmmakers have brought the two together. One of the classic football flicks is <a href=\"http://www.escapetovictory.spodrum.co.uk/\">Escape to Victory</a> released in 1981. The film is set in a prisoner of war camp during the second world war and features Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone starring alongside a host of famous footballers, most notably Pele and Bobby Moore. </p> <p>4. One of the most recent successes in the fruitful relationship between football and film is Gurinder Chadha's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/\">Bend It Like Beckham</a> (2001), which became one of the biggest British hits in America in recent years. The film is about a young girl from London, played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619406/\">Parminder Nagra</a>, who despite growing up in a traditional Sikh family tries to make it as a top female footballer.</p> <p>5. Not content with playing the beautiful game alongside Pele, <a href=\"http://www.sylvesterstallone.com/\">Sylvester Stallone</a> edged his name in the history of silver screen sports with <a href=\"http://rockythemovie.com/\">Rocky</a> (1976), one of the classic boxing films of all time. Stallone, who starred and wrote the script, based the film on a boxing match he saw in which the previously unknown Chuck Wepner beat <a href=\"http://www.ali.com/\">Muhammad Ali </a>. </p> <p>6. Ali has inspired many filmmakers. Most recently Michael Mann, who in his film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248667/ \">Ali</a>, with Will Smith in the lead role, charted the life of the boxing legend.</p> <p>7. Films based on cricket are rarities. However, this summer saw the release of <a href=\"http://iconmovies.com.au/wondrousoblivion/\">Wondrous Oblivion</a> starring <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005148/\">Delroy Lindo</a>. The film, set in south London during the 1960s, sees Lindo teach the son of a Jewish migrant couple how to play cricket. The film deals with wider social issues and portrays the daily trials faced by immigrant communities. </p> <p>8. Cricket was also a central theme in the Bollywood blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.lagaan.com/\">Lagaan</a> (2001) which had an international star-cast. Lagaan is set in rural India in the late 19th century when the country was under British rule. The film is based on the story of a group of farmers who due to lack of rainfall are unable to pay their agricultural tax (Lagaan) and are challenged to a game of cricket by the British officer in charge, played by <a href=\"http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/PersonDetail/personid-53724 \">Paul Blackthorne</a>. If the villagers win the match their tax will be waived, however, if they fail in their sporting task, they will have to pay double. The film offers a unique insight into the history of India while celebrating the triumph of human determination and spirit. </p> <p>9. There have been films based on more unconventional sports. For instance the newly released comedy <a href=\"http://www.dodgeballmovie.com/ \">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</a> starring <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001774/ \">Ben Stiller</a>. In a film vaguely reminiscent of Lagaan a group of men are forced into a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas to help save their local gym from being bought by a health and fitness company. </p> <p>10. What could be more unconventional than Dodgeball? Try a Jamaican bobsled team. <a href=\"http://love.arisen-ashes.net/rhythm/\"> Cool Runnings</a>, starring the late <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/john_candy_tribute/\">John Candy </a>, was based on the true story of the first Jamaican bobsled team trying to make it to the winter Olympics.</p>",
  "<p>John Vidal reports in today's Guardian on the \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/news/0,12597,1309268,00.html\" title=\"Guardian Unlimited | Online | Poisonous detritus of the electronic revolution\">Poisonous detritus of the electronic revolution</a>\".</p> <p>Apparently thousands of tonnes of potentially toxic computer waste is being shipped out of the UK to Africa and Asia every year.</p> <p>From the article:</p> <p>\"The groups... identified a town called Guiyu, some 200 miles north-east of Hong Kong, where up to 100,000 migrant labourers break up and reprocess obsolete computers from around the world.</p> <p>\"The work involves men, women and children unaware of the health and environmental hazards of dismantling such goods - processes that include the open burning of plastics and wires, acid used to extract gold, the melting and burning of toxic soldered circuit boards and the cracking and dumping of toxic lead-laden cathode ray tubes.\"</p> <p>\"Already Guiyu has become so polluted that well water is undrinkable and water has to be trucked in for the entire population, the report said.\"</p> <p>The article also lists the makeup of your typical 60lb desktop machine: including more than 6kg of plastics, 1.7kg of lead, 6.8kg of silica, 3.86kg of aluminium and trace amounts of substances including manganese, arsenic and mercury.</p>",
  "<p>Venice holds the world's biggest biennial; a village in deepest Catalonia the smallest. Next month, biennials open in Seville and S\u00e3o Paolo. There are more and more of these international art festivals. So far this year I've managed Berlin and Cetinje in Montenegro, which was memorable as much for the deserted streets and the beautifully forlorn, melancholic atmosphere of the city as for the art itself. And last week, I went to the third international biennial in Liverpool, which is forlorn in a rather different way. </p> <p>Who, and what, are all these events for? Curators and biennial directors search their souls about this. An ever-growing number of artists also wonder who their work is for, and how it might have value outside the closed economic and critical circuits of the art world. Actually, every artist worries about this, usually at around 4am. </p> <p>All international biennials try to impose a theme, a rubric or gimmick, to make the thing coherent and relevant. The word \"international\" in this context might make us think not of differences - different time zones, languages, customs and art - but of sameness, like those restaurants that serve debased \"international\" cuisine. One might be forgiven for thinking that the international biennial serves up a familiar menu wherever it is held. </p> <p>Resisting that, most cities, or even villages, holding these events attempt to wrap the location itself into the theme. And the artists who appear in biennials nowadays often produce work in response to the social conditions of the location, work that makes some attempt to engage the specifics of place and history, the dynamics of context. But social engagement doesn't necessarily mean engaging art: it can mean boring art. So it is at Liverpool. </p> <p>Instead of having a team of invited curators, Liverpool asked a group of four \"researchers\" - from Vienna, Mexico, Bangkok and Korea, the latter based in New York - to nominate artists who would visit the city, make proposals and produce new work. The results are full of attempts to be relevant: interviews and reportage about communities in tower blocks, a film about the lifestyles and beliefs of local UFO-watchers, works dealing with Liverpool's history as a centre of the slave trade, and a scary compendium of projected images, shot from the top of Liverpool's Radio City tower, showing us views of a city from which any sign of life has been removed. </p> <p>But all the hand-wringing about social relevance and context stands for little when you are faced with the giant, garish inflatable flowers hanging over the concourse in Lime Street Station and Peter Johansson's prefabricated flat-pack kit house at Pier Head, which is painted red, inside and out, and blares Abba's Dancing Queen at full volume. I suppose the inclusion of Yoko Ono in the biennial is largely due to the fact that she is John Lennon's widow. Her posters, badges and souvenir carrier bags depicting a female breast and a female pubis are pretty slight. </p> <p>Shoppers in Williamson Square might have been bemused by a young woman in a red coat wandering fitfully through the pedestrian precinct with her eyes closed some weeks ago. Hardly anyone noticed. It was American artist Jill Magid, guided by a local Citywatch policeman who watched her every move on the city's CCTV cameras, and talked her through the streets via a small radio. This, at Tate Liverpool, is fun to watch and listen to: her uncertain footsteps, the distant observer's good-humoured instructions: \"Go left ... right a bit, there's an old lady in front ...\" It would perhaps have been more fun had he led her, unsuspectingly, into heavy traffic, but there are limits to trust, as well as to the biennial's insurance. </p> <p>Magid is one of several artists negotiating the city by way of walks, bus tours, a dive in the Mersey, a visit to the abandoned and overgrown 1984 Liverpool garden festival site. This last, an evocative video by Spanish artist Lara Almarcegui, is where things begin to get really forlorn. Israeli Yael Bartana's DVD projection in the mock-up, old-fashioned cinema in the Museum of Liverpool Life is a deftly edited wander through the crowds at Aintree, during the Grand National. All human and equine life is here, even a man wearing a joke horse's head. Bartana cuts from horses' hooves to high heels, from preposterous hats to plaited manes. A punch-up erupts by the toilets. You can almost smell the money and the lack of it, the booze, the scent and the horseshit. I like Bartana's work, but is it more than atmosphere and talented editing? </p> <p>Back at the Adelphi Hotel, Wong Hoy Cheong mounted a camera on a live horse's head and had it clomp through the hotel. This happens a lot at the Adelphi, or at least it did when stage and screen cowboy Roy Rogers stayed in 1954. Rogers got the flu, and the faithful Trigger was led up to the cowboy's sickbed to present him with a bouquet, and possibly a bottle of Sudafed. Wong Hoy Cheong's re-enactment, shown at the Bluecoat Arts Centre, is amusing: the glimpses of the wretched Adelphi from the horse's point of view are a reminder why one should never, ever book a room. </p> <p>More fun can be had in Valeska Soares's ballroom back at the Tate. With mirrored walls, floor and ceiling, this infinity chamber means the room is always crowded, even if you dance alone with your multiple reflected selves. Some excellent amateur ballroom dancers were there on my visit, leading a growing number of audience members to take a turn. I saw a very similar work a decade ago, by Carlos Pazos in Valencia. The international art world dance goes on for ever, with its postcolonial foxtrots, situationist sambas, conceptual limbo dances, video cha-chas and heartfelt headbanging. </p> <p>There is only one truly major work in this biennial. Yang Fudong's magnificent, multi-screen video installation at Fact (Liverpool's Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) is a tour de force. Around the walls are projected a small ensemble of musicians, each standing on rocks at the edge of a sea. On trumpets, trombones, strings and keyboard, they perform a beautiful, plaintive composition by Jing Wang, while on the double screen in the centre of the gallery two people, shot in colour and in black and white, act out a love affair. On either side of the screen, we flip from past to present, on the same beach, in the same roiling sea. The work seems to be about presence and escape. There's a white horse here, too, a shipwrecked raft, a sense that neither will leave the beach. </p> <p>Yang is from Shanghai, and Close to the Sea references Chinese films from the 1920s and 30s. If this work is political, it is so through subtle allegory. If it is related to Liverpool, it is only tenuously so, though Yang wants to draw a connection with Liverpool's identity as a maritime city. This doesn't matter. Totally engaging, mysterious and full of memorable images and music, this moved me. Sometimes atmosphere counts more than narrative. </p> <p>As well as the international biennial, Liverpool also includes the two-yearly John Moores painting prize exhibition, which has been running since 1957 at the Walker Art Gallery, and the annual New Contemporaries student and graduate art show. Sneakily, the Walker, with the Lady Lever Art Gallery at Port Sunlight, is also mounting an exhibition of the Stuckists, though it isn't part of the biennial. Once in a lifetime is too often for the Stuckists. So dreadful are they that one might be forgiven for thinking there must be something to them. There isn't, except a lot of ranting. </p> <p>The \u00a325,000 John Moores paint ing prize was won this year by Alexis Harding, who has been doing exactly the same thing since he was a Goldsmiths BA student in the mid-1990s. This could be taken as a rigorousapproach, a sign of commitment, which I suppose it is, but nothing in his work has developed from the initial premise. You always get the same pictorial effect: a painted grid or lattice that has suffered a disastrous land-slip, the top layer of paint sliding off the thick, wet, glutinous layer beneath, carefully arrested in mid-flow before it all ends up on the studio floor. A lot of art has this effect. For art with a real critical edge, we must turn to the New Contemporaries, and David Rowland's short, hilarious video Bill Viola is Rubbish! Well, he is, isn't he? At least Viola didn't make the shortlist for this biennial. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Liverpool Biennial is at various venues across the city until November 28. Details: 0151-709 7444.

  "<p>More than 250 people died in floods and mudslides in Haiti caused by the tropical storm Jeanne over the weekend, the United Nations said yesterday. </p> <p>\"We have counted 250 bodies at the hospital morgue in Gonaives,\" a UN spokesman, Toussaint Congo-Doudou, said. </p> <p>Jeanne brought raging floodwaters throughout the country, forcing residents to take to rooftops and trees. Officials said they expected the death toll to rise further. </p> <p>Jeanne was churning over the Atlantic east of the Bahamas and was forecast to strengthen over open seas this week, heading away from the mainland US. </p> <p>In Gonaives, Haiti's third largest city with a population of 250,000, people waded through ankle-deep mud. Floodwaters nearby destroyed homes and crops from corn to onions. </p> <p>Katya Silme, 18, said that along with her mother and six siblings she had spent the night in a tree because their house was flooded. \"The river destroyed my house completely, and now we have nothing. We have not eaten anything since the floods. We have no money and we need food,\" she said, adding that she had seen many neighbours swept away in the waters on Saturday. </p> <p>Nearby, two dead children lay on a porch, their faces covering with cloths just above the receding waters.</p> <p>The Catholic humanitarian agency Caritas said its workers had picked up 62 bodies in trucks and counted 18 more at a morgue in Gonaives alone, according to Venel Suffrard, the organisation's director in the town. </p> <p>Floodwaters also left much destruction and at least 24 dead in the north-western town of Chansolme, said civil protection director Maria Alta Jean-Baptiste. She also reported at least four dead in Port-de-Paix, and one dead in the south. </p> <p>The deaths came four months after devastating floods along the southern border of Haiti and the neighbouring Dominican Republic. In those floods some 1,700 bodies were recovered and 1,600 more people are missing, presumed dead. </p> <p>Floods this time tore through Gonaives and surrounding areas, covering crops and turning roads into rivers. The interim prime minister, Gerard Latortue, and his interior minister toured the area in a United Nations truck on Sunday, but were unable to reach many areas because of washed-out roads.</p> <p>Floods are often particularly devastating in Haiti because it is almost completely deforested and unable to hold back floodwaters. </p> <p>People said the floods caught them by surprise on Saturday night. Jean-Baptiste Agilus, a 46-year-old teacher, said he watched the deluge engulf houses in his neighbourhood, filling some with four metres (13ft) of water. </p> <p>Mr Agilus said he saw his neighbour running from his house, saying his wife and two children, aged 12 and 15, were swept away in the waters. </p> <p>\"The water rushed into all the homes in the neighbourhood. It destroyed everything,\" he added. </p> <p>Officials reported at least 388 people injured in Gonaives alone. </p> <p>Argentinian troops, part of a UN mission and responsible for patrolling Gonaives, treated at least 150 injuries, said spokesman Emilio Vera. </p> <p>No doctors were staffing Gonaives' main hospital, which was being used as a morgue. </p> <p>Mr Latortue declared Gonaives a disaster area and urged the international community to provide aid.</p>",
  "Last year we lost one of the great Liberal Democrats and the last to serve as Chancellor: Roy Jenkins. In one of his fine biographies he describes Gladstone's 1860 budget. It was a speech - for Gladstone - of unusual brevity: a mere 4 hours. Roy notes approvingly that he cut duties on French wine in the interests of European free trade. But Gladstone had two main concerns: balancing the budget after a costly war and with simpler and fairer taxes, cutting many duties on what he called the 'working man', preferring to tax the wealthy. <p>My priorities as Shadow Chancellor today maintain Gladstone's liberal tradition.</p> <p>There are painful economic realities. Budgets have to add up. Choices are needed in public spending. People want fairer taxes, not ever rising taxes, and they want value for money.</p> <p>Our response has been to prepare a costed programme for government. The Liberal Democrat pre manifesto for the General Election is to be debated at Conference tomorrow. My role in that process is often to say \"no\". Indeed where people used to ask \"Dr Who\"? they now say \"Ah, Dr No\". But I take heart from our Liberal Democrat councillors around the country. Many have inherited badly run spend thrift Labour authorities. All face hard budget constraints. They are discovering that progressive politics involves financial discipline and tough choices.</p> <p>And I think the electorate will respect candour. Letwin and Brown are promising miraculously large sums in tax cuts or public spending entirely financed by 'eliminating waste'. I wish. I came into politics from private industry; and the government could learn a lot about cutting costs. But I suspect the electorate is suffering from 'miracle fatigue' and shares my scepticism. It is just not this easy. We aim to be by contrast, more concrete, more modest and more honest.</p> <p><b>Fairness &amp; Liberalism</b><br> Economic discipline and credibility are essential. But we intend to balance these economic imperatives with greater social justice. When I worked with Gordon Brown on the Red Papers for Scotland 30 years ago I never imagined then that after almost eight years of Labour Government, under his Chancellorship: inequality of income and wealth would be as bad or higher than under Mrs Thatcher; the poorest fifth of the population would pay a higher percentage of their income in tax than the richest fifth; and that 'fat cats' in failed companies would be able to award themselves million in payoffs and bonuses while hardworking, thrifty people could see their savings and pensions wrecked or stolen. Labour's record is miserable. We could do better.</p> <p>Our commitment to social justice is reinforced by a firm commitment to liberal economic policies: economic freedom. Without wealth creation there is no wealth to spread. That is why I emphasise the traditional liberal message - from Adam Smith to today - that markets must be allowed to work; trade should be free; private enterprise should not be shackled by excessive regulation; and private and state monopolies should be opened up to competition. Yet, damaging state intervention abounds: from the ruinous and immoral Common Agricultural Policy to the bureaucratic and illiberal Working Time Directive and subsidies to nuclear power and arms exporters: What I call the industrial welfare state.</p> <p><b>Stability and the Debt Bubble</b><br> Economic freedom is not the same as a free for all: a mistake the Conservatives made. They unleashed an unsustainable economic boom which collapsed, such that their reputation for economic competence remains in ruins to this day. </p> <p>Gordon Brown has done better, so far. He adopted the Lib Dem policy of an independent Bank of England to set interest rates. And he has followed fiscal rules, cutting government debt. Like the Good Lord in the Book of Genesis he created a new economic world in seven days. But he has spent the last seven years admiring his own creation. Meanwhile the Devil has been at work. An orgy of debt financed household spending has generated a trillion pounds of debt; most of it is secured against a financial 'bubble' in the housing market. As a result numerous young families cannot get onto the housing ladder and those that do have to face negative equity if, or when, the bubble bursts. </p> <p>It may not happen. I seriously hope not. But the Chancellor is taking serious risks by relying solely on the Bank of England's use of interest rates to achieve what is called a 'soft landing'. I admire the Governor and his colleagues. But when an overloaded aircraft tries to land at night in fog on a strange airfield the chances of disaster are high.</p> <p><b>Global Risks</b><br> Policies for economic stability are now more essential, since the world economy, in my view, is teetering on the edge of a major economic shock. One reason is the price of oil. The problem is not caused, as Gordon Brown claims, by OPEC restricting supply; there is genuinely a serious shortage of capacity.</p> <p>A British government less given to vanity and to lecturing the rest of the world on the brilliance of its economic achievements would see the dangers and prepare for them. They would see the connection between the economy and the environment: that curbing excessive energy demand is necessary for our economy our security and the future of the planet. Conservation, not complacency, is required.</p> <p><b>Tough Choices</b><br> Turning now to the budget, at the last general election we argued that a key priority was to support under funded public services like the NHS and to finance that expansion, honestly, through taxation. The government raised taxes - stealthily. We supported the extra funding, and we voted for it. At Conference last year we pledged that future spending commitments should not rely on higher general taxation but on savings elsewhere in government. We pledged to find \u00a35 billion per year to meet our priorities, notably education, pensions and policing. </p> <p>The biggest new financial outlay is to provide a decent state pension. What we can afford is a generous pension to all men and women over 75, earnings linked and not means tested. There is now a growing consensus, everywhere except in Downing Street that we have to move away from means testing since millions do not claim it and live in poverty. While those that do, have little incentive to save. We have put forward a practical, affordable alternative. </p> <p>Then we want to develop our long standing commitment to education. We want to see primary school class sizes brought down further; and investment in training, particularly science and maths teachers who are in alarmingly short supply. There are far better ways of investing in young people than the Government's Baby Bond scheme. It is absurd to commit \u00a3250m a year of taxpayers' money for a system of long term savings when young people are being led by Government policy into excessive debt.</p> <p>I don't pretend that it is easy to take a large chunk out of government spending departments. We have suggested, for example, dismantling the DTI. The DTI does some useful things, like financing non-commercial 'blue skies' scientific research. These activities should continue, elsewhere in government. But serious cuts would have to be made in old fashioned bailouts. The vast majority of businesses do not, in my experience, demand nor need government help. They already live in the Land of Tough Choices. As a leading entrepreneur told Mrs Hewitt recently: \"please stop trying to help us; stop interfering and let us get on with our job.\"</p> <p><b>Fairer Taxes and Tax Reform</b><br> Nor are there soft options in relation to taxation. This country doesn't need or want higher taxes. But people want the burden distributed more fairly.</p> <p>That is why we advocate scrapping council tax and replacing it with LIT on the model which operates efficiently in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and the USA. That is also why we argue for a higher 50% rate on earnings over \u00a3100,000 pa. This revenue will enable us to abolish tuition fees and top-up fees, introduce free personal care helping people with long term diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's and hold down local taxation. </p> <p>It speaks volumes for the priorities of the present Prime Minister that he denounces as dangerously radical the same 50% tax rate: a rate which Nigel Lawson in his memoirs tells us that even Margaret Thatcher was happy to live with. </p> <p>Blair defends or ignores higher marginal tax rates on those on modest incomes: a 50% rate currently paid by pensioners on pension credit; a 50% rate on middle income families after the new student fee repayment obligations; and a 60% rate on low paid workers - as much as 90% for those caught in the benefit trap. Perhaps we should not be surprised that our Prime Minister doesn't understand the economics of poverty when he prefers to spend his quality time with Silvio Berlusconi and George Bush. </p> <p>We believe that too many people on modest income pay too much tax. Under our proposals for taxation and public spending 70% of tax payers would pay less tax than they do at present.</p> <p><b>The Alternatives</b><br> What are the alternatives?</p> <p>The Conservatives, in particular, are reluctant to face difficult choices on spending and taxation. </p> <p>My Conservative opposite number is Oliver Letwin - a delightful and undoubtedly clever man. He established his reputation as a financial wizard while he was the Tory Home Affairs spokesman. He came up with the idea of saving \u00a32bn a year by shipping out asylum seekers to a remote island.</p> <p>Let's just think about it. Round up our asylum seekers - most of them currently working and paying tax. Buy - or lease - an island, somewhere. Build camps to house them. Ship them out. Send their lawyers and relatives backwards and forwards. And save \u00a32 billion?</p> <p>This brainwave deserves to be expressed in mathematical form. Take x, y and z, all positive numbers. Solve the equation where x + y + z = minus 2 billion. This is so original it should be called the Howard-Letwin Theorem. Suffice to say nobody has yet solved it.</p> <p>After this fiasco, Oliver has moved on to bigger things. At his party conference in two weeks, I predict that he will offer some mouth-watering tax cuts to Middle England. </p> <p>He will tell us that he is going to cut waste, billions and billions of it. Of course, genuine waste must be eliminated but it should not be an excuse to duck tough choices. When Oliver Letwin and Michael Howard talk about government waste I am reminded of the old story of the economist stranded on a desert island with tins of food and nothing else. Asked how he is going to eat, he thinks carefully and comes up with a solution - \"Let us assume the existence of a tin opener\". The Tory tin opener is waste. By assuming vast savings from waste they can spend more, cut taxes and balance the budget. Brilliant! Why did no one think of it before?</p> <p>They did. Campaigns against \"waste\" have been the last refuge of Tory politicians without policies or priorities through the ages. </p> <p>Now Gordon Brown has joined in, he promises to match any the Tories can come up with. But since the promised efficiency is never defined let alone measured, so this increasingly resembles a competition in who can nail the most jelly to a wall. </p> <p>And, of course, when Brown and Letwin talk about waste they forget that they both supported the Iraq war which has cost the taxpayer over \u00a33.5 billion to date, and rising. </p> <p><b>Conclusion</b><br> The debate should be about more than waste. It should be about our vision of the future.</p> <p>I reject the old stereotypes of 'left and right'. I don't accept the socialist doctrine that while we can have more fairness in tax and better funded public services the package must also include more bureaucracy and government regulation and centralisation: this obsessive Labour belief, New or Old, that the Man in Whitehall (usually it is a man) always knows best.</p> <p>I reject also the assumption of the Right that if we have a liberal economy - markets, competition, free enterprise - we must accept that there is no such thing as society; that we must have widening inequality and a free for all where the vulnerable are trampled underfoot.</p> <p>They are both wrong. I believe we can have both a liberal and fair economy; better public services and tax cuts for the less well off, strong growth, with tough financial discipline. Our Britain, a Lib Dem Britain, would be a country which embraces economic freedom and social justice.</p>",
  "<p>I knew there was going to be trouble as soon as Marnie went into that Edinburgh junk shop with her father. There was something quite creepy about the place. Then an old clock chimed for the first time in 11 centuries - always a sign something's up. And the shopkeeper knew it was Marnie's 11th birthday, even though no one had told him. He said something about her being the chosen one, then urged her to take an old shoebox containing four carved animals - a wolf, an eagle, a bear and a snake. The eagle winked at her. </p> <p>This is <strong>Shoebox Zoo</strong> (CBBC, and BBC1 from Tuesday). At home, Marnie's dad doesn't help the situation. Putting her to bed, he gets out the wolf. \"I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night,\" he says, before making a wolf noise. Then he turns the light off. Thanks Dad. </p> <p>Of course, the creatures come to life in the night - with the voices of Simon Callow, Rik Mayall, Siobhan Redmond and Alan Cumming. And Marnie finds herself in a strange magical world, \"a world out of kilter, where science tramples morality,\" whatever that means. Evil comes in the form of Senor Toledo the shapeshifter, a dodgy Spanish geezer in a white suit - a bit like the man from Del Monte, although I don't think Toledo ever says yes. Oh, and there's an ancient helmeted head thing that comes out of the telly from time to time. </p> <p>It's Harry Potter plus animation, with a bit of Buffy thrown in. And judging from this first episode, it's very good. If quite frightening. Maybe kids don't scare so easily these days, but if you're thirtysomething and three quarters, it's pretty bloody terrifying. I'll be sleeping with the light on for a while. </p> <p><strong>Blood on the Turntable</strong> (BBC3) told the fascinating story of Jack Thompson, a Christian crusader, and his battle against hip hop in the early 1990s. Jack wasn't a big fan of Ice-T and in particular the song Cop Killer. But more entertaining was the problem he had with his fellow Miami residents 2 Live Crew. If Jack went on Desert Island Discs you can be pretty sure that 2 Live Crew's Me So Horny wouldn't be on his list: </p> <p>\"I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning </p> <p>I have an appetite for sex ,'cause me so horny.\" </p> <p>Jack's message was pretty much the opposite: me not so horny. \"This was raw sewage flowing to the rest of the planet from where I lived,\" he said. </p> <p>Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew didn't understand the problem: \"We all get horny. The only reason why we're on earth is because we get horny... What's the problem? We're only talking about sex.\" </p> <p>Anyway it went to court, and that's where the comedy really begins. After failing to convince the jury of the record's artistic value, 2 Live Crew's lawyer decided to show that there was much worse material freely available around the court house. So he went out and came back with a few magazines he'd bought to be handed round among the jury - magazines such as Naked Stranger and Ass Parade. </p> <p>Then there were a few vocabulary problems. During the cross examination, the District State Attorney didn't know the meaning of one word. \"And what does 'splack' mean?\" he asked Luther Campbell. So, the lawyer remembers, Campbell had to explain in court that \"it's the sound of wet sex when a man and a woman are engaged in heavy sexual actively\". </p> <p>In the end the record was branded obscene, which was probably about right. It was a crap record anyway - unlike Ice-T's stuff from around the same time. All very educational, anyway. </p> <p><strong>Jack Dee Live At the Apollo</strong> (BBC1) turned out to be Omid Djalili Live At the Apollo. Jack was there, for 10 minutes at the beginning and a few at the end, in his shiny suit and his new sideburns (hmm, not sure about those, Jack). But this was really Omid's show. Which was fine, because Omid, it turns out, is pretty funny. He's a fat Iranian who claims to be on the Atkins diet. \"Today I had 16 chickens, a horse and a fried egg.\" </p> <p>Omid Djalili's humour is rather interesting. He does accents, and jokes about farting in the library. But there's more to him than that - it's a kind of knowing parody of a safe, cuddly, self-mocking Iranian. \"I could be doing a very hard-line political statement about racial stereotyping,\" he says, in fact saying something about racial stereotyping. \"But the truth is, the accents get a few big laughs and people love me, so why rock the boat?\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair has agreed to scrap most of the fees levied for making use of the Freedom of Information Act, as part of an effort to regain disillusioned liberal voters at the election. <p>He told a cabinet meeting devoted to party issues last week that Labour was losing votes, not just those of disillusioned working class families but also of the middle class, especially women, many of whom oppose the war in Iraq. </p> <p>It is the first time in many years that Mr Blair has acknowledged in private that the Liberal Democrats win more than a temporary protest vote. </p> <p>It is expected that Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs secretary, will announce that charges for applications for information under the Freedom of Information Act will not be levied so long as the cost of gathering the information does not exceed \u00a3600. </p> <p>That it the ceiling at which parliamentary questions are not answered, on the grounds of disproportionate cost. </p> <p>The act comes into force next year and the Information Commissioner has been pressing for minimal charges. Ministers believe the government has not had enough political credit for introducing the law and has been bogged down by lobbyists demanding wider freedoms. </p> <p>Lord Falconer is eager that the fact of the act, a long standing demand of the civil liberties left, is not lost in the argument that only professional groups will be able to afford to use it. </p> <p>The cost of gathering information will often depend on the complexity of the analysis required by civil servants, since much raw information is available for publication at the touch of a computer button. </p> <p>Writing in the Guardian the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, has made a fresh effort to crystallise Labour's attack on Charles Kennedy's politics, insisting that his party is moving to the right. </p> <p>He says: \"As the Tories have lurched further to the right, the Liberal Democrats have set up camp in the space they have vacated. </p> <p>\"Charles Kennedy says they are neither left nor right. Actually they are seeking to be both, lurching to the right in policy while using Iraq to maintain a leftwing appeal.\" </p> <p>Labour's concern about women voters is reflected in the decision of the industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, to emphasise plans for family-friendly measures, such as longer time off for mothers. </p> <p>The meeting was also told that Labour's private polling shows that many voters in the social catagories D and E still did not believe the government had done enough to tackle its core issues of anti-social behaviour, asylum and Europe. </p> <p>But Mr Blair now recognises that he needs to balance these demands with the threat of alienating the politically liberal vote. </p> <p>He is also seeking ways to refashion his unpopular inter nationalism by trying to shift the focus from Iraq to his plans for Africa and new initiatives on climate change. </p> <p>He is due to visit Africa soon, even though he has insisted that his focus from now until the election will be on domestic issues. </p> <p>Labour's national executive discussed motions for the party conference yesterday, and it is likely that those backing the withdrawal of troops from Iraq will not make the conference floor. </p> <p>It is also unlikely there will be divisive votes on whether 16- and 17-year-olds should be given the vote, a policy rejected by the Electoral Commission, and whether there should be a mainly elected House of Lords: two minority positions adopted by the Labour policy forum in 2003. </p> <p>The option for the Lords favoured by ministers is an 80% indirectly elected, 20% appointed chamber. There would also be clarification that the Commons is the supreme body.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is throwing out more than a million tonnes of electronic \"e-waste\" such as broken computer monitors and discarded mobile phones every year, and new government figures show that more than ever is going abroad. </p> <p>Last year, 23,000 tonnes of IT and other electronic equipment was shipped out illegally, mostly to China, west Africa, Pakistan and India.</p> <p>In one case, the documents on a container waiting to be shipped from Felixstowe to Pakistan declared that its contents were innocuous plastic packaging. But when customs officers opened it up they found tonnes of broken computer monitors and other electronic waste collected by a south Wales company which was sending it to Lahore to be dismantled by hand for its lead and other valuable toxic contents. The illegal shipment of hazardous waste was blocked and returned.</p> <p>The government's pollution watchdog, the Environment Agency, says the e-waste exports are worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Last year such waste involved tens of thousands of old computers, 500,000 television sets, 3m refrigerators, 160,000 tonnes of other electrical equipment and millions of discarded mobile phones, all sent to the poorest countries in the world.</p> <p>But the agency admits it has no idea how much of the waste is being deliberately dumped on poor countries by companies trying to avoid paying increasingly high disposal costs in the UK, and how much is only technically illegal because companies have filled in the forms incorrectly.</p> <p>\"It is not necessarily all illegal,\" said an agency spokesman. \"There is a legitimate international trade in goods, with an overseas market for usable equipment such as computers and TVs. Further work will help us to find out how much is illegal. Our investigations suggest some exporters are not seeking the appropriate legal authorisation.\"</p> <p>However, two reports not re leased by the Environment Agency but seen by the Guardian suggest the problem is far greater than the government wants to admit.</p> <p>One, by the Industry Council for Electronic Equipment Recycling (Icer), is based on confidential interviews with businesses and concludes that most computer exports are certainly waste because the goods are neither tested nor repaired before export.</p> <p>Another, by Impel, a grouping of six European countries' environment agencies including Britain's, says that exporters are finding new ways of bypassing the rules and that governments have neither the resources nor the will to give any priority to checking what leaves the country.</p> <p>\"Priorities for enforcement are low, and as a consequence only little or no capacity is reserved for enforcement _ Follow-up actions cannot be carried out. Enforcement of legislation is absolutely needed,\" say the report's authors.</p> <p>Impel's ongoing study of six major European ports, including Felixstowe, has found that 22% of all the waste exports checked for more than a year were illegal. Enforcement agencies in the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Poland and elsewhere found large quantities of computer equipment, electrical cable, cathode ray tubes, single-use cameras, old tyres, and oil and contaminated motor parts being exported.</p> <p>In many cases the authorities had to let the shipment go because they could not tell what equipment was reusable or what was obsolete.</p> <p>Many of the containers inspected showed misleading information about their contents and origin, and the report suggested scrap exporters were trying to confuse the authorities. One tactic, it noted, was to \"port hop\" - send waste from one European des tination to another, leaving a trail of documents which are impossible to check. A shipment of British single-use cameras complete with batteries was sent to Germany, where it was twice repacked before being shipped to China for \"recycling\".</p> <p>China and India, thought to be the target of most e-waste exports, have urged Britain and other rich countries through the UN and other international forums to stop exporting hazardous waste because they do not have the facilities to inspect all the traffic being sent.</p> <p>EU environment agencies agree. \"No one can pretend that port authorities in India or Asia are not immune from corruption and abuse. It is far more difficult to carry out inspections at the port of destination,\" says the Impel report.</p> <p>The scale of the trade and the damage it is doing is becoming clear. A major investigation by an international coalition of environmental groups this year found huge quantities of e-waste being exported to China, Pakistan and India, where it was being reprocessed in operations extremely harmful to both human health and the environment.</p> <p>The groups, including Basel Action Network (Ban), Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Toxics Link India and Greenpeace, found e-waste mixed with scrap metal from Japan, South Korea, the US and the EU, and identified a town called Guiyu, some 200 miles north-east of Hong Kong in the coastal province of Guangdong, where up to 100,000 migrant labourers break up and reprocess obsolete computers from around the world.</p> <p>The work involves men, women and children unaware of the health and environmental hazards of dismantling such goods - processes that include the open burning of plastics and wires, the use of acid to extract gold, the melting and burning of toxic soldered circuit boards and the cracking and dumping of toxic lead-laden cathode ray tubes.</p> <p>Already Guiyu has become so polluted that well water is undrinkable and water has to be trucked in for the entire population, the report said.</p> <p>\"We found a cyber-age nightmare,\" said Jim Puckett of Ban. \"They call this recycling, but it's really dumping by another name. Yet to our horror, we discovered that rather than banning it, governments are actually encouraging this ugly trade in order to avoid finding real solutions to the massive tide of obsolete computer waste generated.\"</p> <p>The groups appealed to global manufacturers to take responsibility for their electronic products and phase out the dangerous substances found within them.</p> <p>\"It is ironic that these elec tronic discards are being collected in industrialised countries for the purpose of dumping them in poor countries. Asia is the dustbin of the world's hazardous waste,\" said Von Hernandez of Greenpeace International.</p> <p>Exports of e-waste are likely to rise sharply in the next few years as European laws covering electrical and electronic goods insist that scrap is recycled and barred from being burned in incinerators.</p> <p>\"People want the latest electronic gadgets, but they come at a price,\" said Claire Wilton of Friends of the Earth. \"Computers and televisions contain toxic materials. It's the responsibility of manufacturers to design goods, computers and DVD players that are re-usable and recyclable.\"</p>",
  "One of the 13 detainees interned for nearly three years as suspected international terrorists was released yesterday from a high security prison by the home secretary, David Blunkett, without any detailed explanation being offered. <p>The release of the Algerian national, identified only as D, comes just three months after he was said by a special judicial commission to have a \"long history of involvement in terrorist support activity\" and the ability and commitment to resume that work were he at liberty in Britain. </p> <p>His solicitor, Natalie Garcia, said last night she had broken the news to him: \"He was absolutely choked. All he could say was 'I don't understand'. He feels he's been locked up for three years just on a whim.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett in a statement to MPs said yesterday he had made the decision because \"the weight of evidence\" no longer justified D's continued detention and he was revoking the certificate branding him a suspected international terrorist. A Home Office spokeswoman would not elaborate on the reasons for the decision other than saying that the decision was made ahead of the second statutory review of his case. She added that the home secretary had always promised to act on new information or a change in circumstances. </p> <p>The Algerian man walked free from Woodhill high security prison near Milton Keynes yesterday afternoon and has been given \"discretionary leave to stay\" in the country for six months with \"a range of assistance\" from the national asylum support service. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett told MPs yesterday: \"In revoking D's certificate I have made clear that any further activities that are assessed to be a threat to national security could lead to him being certified again.\" </p> <p>The decision mystified human rights campaigners who said it raised questions over the accuracy of the intelligence used to detain him. </p> <p>The Algerian national lost an appeal against his internment last October when the special immigration appeals commission backed Mr Blunkett's decision to detain him indefinitely. He was among the original 13 detained in De cember 2001 when the government's emergency anti-terror laws came into effect. </p> <p>Mr Justice Ouseley, the Siac chairman, described him as \"a practised and accomplished liar\". He was said to be an active supporter of the GIA, the Algerian armed Islamic group which is banned in Britain. The Siac ruling said he was based at a Birmingham bookshop where he developed links with Abu Qatada, the Muslim cleric accused of links to al-Qaida who is also interned under the anti-terror laws. </p> <p>Amnesty International's director, Kate Allen, welcomed his release, but added: \"The irony is that the home secretary's decision is, like the internment process itself, secretive, part of a shadow justice system rather than the rule of law.\"</p>",

First of all we'd like to see the standard of the university reflected in the fee by charging the full amount. The notion of scholarships will probably be for the most able students who would qualify for further scholarships through the three years according to their progress - it would be a motivational thing.\"</strong> </p> <p>4 How much for?<br> <strong>\"Don't know.
