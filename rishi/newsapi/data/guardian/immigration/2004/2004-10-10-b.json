  "<p><strong> Poached pears with praline ice cream and chocolate sauce</strong> </p> <p>A seductive contrast of textures here. Silky pears, heavy with syrup, cold, nubbly ice cream and warm, velvety chocolate sauce. One can't help thinking all desserts should be as sumptuous as this. Such decadence would follow pretty much anything - one of the delights of having such a contrast of textures - but it would be particularly soothing after a spicy stew. </p> <p><strong> serves 4</strong><br> <strong>pears - 4<br> golden caster sugar - 2 tbsp a vanilla pod fine, dark chocolate - 200g praline ice cream lemon juice - 1tbsp</strong><br> </p> <p>Pour a good litre of water into a deep, wide pan, add the sugar, vanilla pod and lemon juice and bring to the boil. Peel the pears, tug out their stalks, then halve them and scoop out their cores. Drop them into the sugar syrup and simmer for 10-15 minutes till the pears are translucent and tender. Leave in the syrup to cool. During this time they will become silkily soft and soaked-through with syrup. </p> <p>Get the ice cream out of the freezer. Chop the chocolate. Bring 200ml water to the boil then whisk in the chocolate, removing from the heat as soon as it has melted - a matter of seconds. Place two pear halves on each of four dishes, add the praline ice cream, one ball per person should be ample, then pour over the warm chocolate sauce. </p> <p><strong> Chicken patties with (or without) gorgonzola and rosemary</strong> </p> <p>There are two possibilities here. Either serve the patties as they are, dry-fried in a non-stick pan till golden (in which case serve them with quarters of lemon) or stuff them with blue cheese and bake them instead. Whether you take the simple or the rich route, you end up with the most savoury little 'burgers' imaginable. </p> <p><strong> serves 3-4</strong><br> <strong>a medium onion</strong></p> <p><strong>garlic - 2 cloves<br> butter - 25g cubed pancetta - 100g rosemary - 3 bushy sprigs minced chicken</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> for the optional stuffing:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>gorgonzola - 75g<br> chicken stock - 250ml</strong><br> </p> <p>Peel the onion and garlic and chop finely, then let them soften and colour lightly in the butter. Stir in the small cubes of pancetta. Strip the rosemary leaves from their stalks, chop finely then add them to the onion mixture, letting them cook for a few minutes till coloured. Let the mixture cool a little. </p> <p>Add the minced chicken and season generously with black pepper and a little salt (the pancetta and gorgonzola will both contribute to the seasoning). Set the oven at 190 c/gas 5. Now, to make the simple patty, shape the mixture into six little burgers, about the size of a digestive biscuit, leave to settle for half an hour, then fry in a non-stick pan for 4 or 5 minutes each side and serve with lemon. Or, if you want something richer, make the stuffed patties. </p> <p>Take a heaped tablespoon of the chicken mixture and push a hollow in it with your thumb. Tip a heaped teaspoon of cheese into the hollow then cover it with a second tablespoon of chicken mixture. Squash gently to form a patty and place on a baking sheet. Continue with this till you have used up the mixture - you will have about six - then refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. </p> <p>Heat up a non-stick frying pan. When hot, brown the patties on both sides, a matter of three minutes on each, then transfer them to an oven-proof dish. Pour in the stock and bake for 25-30 minutes, till the patties are sizzling and the stock is bubbling. Serve two to three patties per person and spoon over some of the hot chicken stock. </p> <p><strong> Baked onions with parmesan and cream</strong> </p> <p>I normally eat these deeply savoury baked onions as a side dish to cold roast beef, and that is probably when they are at their best. But they make a sound main course, too. I eat them and their cheesy sauce with mounds of comforting brown rice, steamed with a cinnamon stick and a couple of cloves. Wet-weather food of the first order. </p> <p><strong> serves 2-3 with rice</strong> </p> <p><strong>onions - 4 medium to large<br> whipping or double cream - 300ml grated parmesan - a good handful<br></strong> </p> <p><strong> to serve:</strong> steamed brown rice for 4 </p> <p>Set the oven at 180 /gas 4. Peel the onions and bring them to the boil in a large, deep pot of water. Leave them at a bright simmer for about 25 minutes until tender. Lift them out with a draining spoon. </p> <p>Slice the onions in half from root to tip and put them cut-side down in an oven-proof dish. Pour over the cream and season with salt, pepper and the grated cheese. Bake for 25 minutes till bubbling. </p> <p><strong> Penne with gorgonzola, walnuts and sage</strong> </p> <p>Supper in 10 minutes: what more could anyone ask on a chilly autumn night? The flavour here is deliberately mild and soothing. The pasta coheres gently with the sauce rather than swims in it. I usually make a chicory salad for afterwards, something crisp and slightly bitter. Even then, all I want to do is to drop off to sleep when I've eaten it. That's what creamy pasta recipes are for. </p> <p><strong> serves 2</strong> </p> <p><strong>300g penne or other small tubular pasta<br> <br>creamy gorgonzola - about 300g<br> <br>walnuts - a dozen or more, freshly shelled<br> <br>a few sage leaves, about six will do</strong> </p> <p> Put the pasta on to cook in a deep pan of generously salted boiling water. Test it throughout the cooking, but it should be ready after about 9 minutes. I like my pasta to have a bit of bite. Drain the penne in a colander, reserving a couple of tablespoonfuls of the cooking water. Put the empty pan immediately back on the stove and turn down the heat to low. Add the cheese and the reserved cooking water, then stir for a minute or less till the cheese starts to melt and you have an impromptu sauce. Tip the pasta back into the pan with the walnuts and sage leaves, then tip onto warm plates. </p> <p><strong> Pot roast pigeon</strong> </p> <p>Nothing fancy this, just a sound pot roast pigeon recipe with classic flavourings and a thick, old-fashioned gravy. You will need some bashed or creamed root vegetables to soak up the copious juice. </p> <p><strong> serves 4</strong> </p> <p><strong>butter - 50g<br> <br>plump, oven-ready pigeons - 4<br> <br>plump, herby sausages - 4<br> <br>a medium to large onion<br> <br>a large carrot<br> <br>celery - 2 sticks<br> <br>a few sprigs of thyme<br> <br>garlic - 2 cloves<br> <br>unsmoked streaky bacon - 4 rashers<br> <br>bay leaves - 2<br> <br>juniper berries - 12<br> <br>plain flour - a level tbsp<br> <br>fruity red wine - 250ml<br> <br>chicken or game stock - 250ml</strong> </p> <p><strong> to serve:</strong> mashed parsnip or potato </p> <p>Melt half the butter in a heavy casserole, then brown the pigeons and sausages lightly on all sides. Lift them out and set aside. Set the oven at 190 c/gas 5. </p> <p>Peel the onion, cut it in half, then slice each half into five from root to tip. Melt the remaining butter over a moderate heat and add the onion. Peel the carrot, cut it into large dice and add it to the onion, together with the chopped celery, 4 or 5 sprigs of thyme and the peeled and sliced garlic. Continue cooking, stirring from time to time. </p> <p>Remove the rind from the bacon and cut each rasher into about six pieces. Stir into the onion and add the juniper berries, lightly crushed, and the bay leaves. Leave to soften, making certain the sausages have the opportunity to colour. After about 20 minutes, the vegetables should be soft and golden. </p> <p>Stir in the flour, let it cook for a few minutes then stir in the wine and the stock. Bring almost to the boil then return the pigeons and sausages to the pan and roast in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until the pigeons are tender but still lightly pink in the centre. </p> <p><strong> Roast leg of lamb with tomato gravy</strong><br> </p> <p>Late autumn often produces some of the best tomatoes, sweet-sharp and intensely flavoursome. Some spinach and roast potatoes would be good here. </p> <p><strong> serves 6</strong> </p> <p><strong>leg of lamb - 2kg<br> <br>a little olive oil<br> <br>2 whole heads of garlic<br> <br>tomatoes - 750g<br> <br>olive oil - 50ml<br> <br>balsamic vinegar - 50ml<br> <br>several sprigs of oregano</strong> </p> <p>Set the oven at 230 c/gas 8. Rub the lamb all over with a little olive oil. Season the fat and any flesh you can get at with salt and black pepper and lay it in a roasting tin, tuck the heads of garlic, halved and tossed in a little olive oil, under the meat. Roast in the hot oven for 20 minutes. Turn down the heat to 200 c/gas 6 and continue cooking for a further 30 minutes. </p> <p>Cut the larger tomatoes in half and toss them in a bowl with a grinding of salt and pepper, the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and oregano leaves pulled from their stems. When the 30 minutes cooking is up, tip the tomatoes and their dressing around the lamb and continue roasting for a further 25 minutes. </p> <p>Remove the lamb from the roasting tin and leave it to rest, somewhere warm and with a bowl or tea towel over it. This will keep the flesh moist and allow it to relax. Please, don't skip this resting; it will keep the meat much juicier than if you hack at it the second it comes from the oven. </p> <p>Turn the oven up to 230 c/gas 8. Return the tomatoes, garlic and pan juices to the oven and leave them for 10-15 minutes while the meat rests. Take the roasting tin out of the oven, remove about a third of the roast tomatoes and keep them warm. Using a potato masher or draining spoon, squash the remaining tomatoes and the garlic into the pan juices. Tip the the lot into a sieve suspended over a warm bowl or saucepan. Push the tomato pulp through the sieve with a wooden spoon then discard the remains. Check the seasoning of the tomato 'gravy' underneath, and correct it with salt, pepper and balsamic vinegar. I tend to heat it up for a minute, too, but then, I like my gravy really hot. </p> <p>Carve the lamb and spoon and serve with the roasted tomatoes and the tomato gravy. </p> <p><strong> Baked peppers</strong> </p> <p>There is so much sweet juice you will need plenty of bread to mop it up. No need to skin or seed the tomatoes if you are using cherry tomatoes such as Gardeners Delight; this is rustic, rough-edged cooking and will be less interesting if you do. This makes a fine, light lunch with some Taleggio or Robbiolo cheese afterwards. </p> <p><strong> serves 4 as a light lunch</strong> </p> <p><strong>red peppers - 4<br> <br>plump garlic cloves - 3<br> <br>ripe cherry tomatoes - 16<br> <br>olive oil<br> <br>anchovy fillets - 6<br> <br>basil - about 12-16 bushy leaves</strong> </p> <p>Halve the peppers lengthways, tear out and discard the white core and seeds then lay the peppers cut-side up in a baking dish. They should fit snugly. Peel the garlic, slice it finely and put a few slices in each pepper, together with a little salt and a tablespoon of oil. Halve the tomatoes and tuck them in. Bake for 50 minutes at 200 c/gas 6 until the peppers have almost collapsed and are full of juice. Rinse, dry and roughly chop together the anchovies and basil leaves. Stir a spoonful of the basil and anchovies into each of the peppers, return to the oven for 10 minutes, then serve warm or at room temperature with crusty bread. </p> <p><strong> Roast halibut with capers, lemon and parsley</strong> </p> <p>Given a spanking fresh piece of white fish, I sometimes do nothing more to it than rub it with salt and roast it in a very hot oven, its only gilding the juice from a fat Sicilian lemon and a modest pile of lightly steamed spinach. Last time, I got the parsley out too, and a few delectably piquant little capers. This to me is a feast of the first order. You can keep your fancy French sauces. </p> <p><strong> serves 2</strong> </p> <p><strong>halibut steaks - 2 x 225g<br> <br>olive oil<br> <br>salted capers - 2 tbsp<br> <br>flat-leaf parsley - the leaves from a small bunch<br> <br>juice of a large lemon</strong> </p> <p><strong> to serve:</strong> steamed spinach, lemon halves </p> <p>Set the oven at 230 c/gas 8. Warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a flame-proof baking dish over a moderate flame. Rub the fish generously with salt and pepper and brown lightly on one side in the hot oil. A minute should suffice. Put the fish into the hot oven and bake for 7-8 minutes until opaque and the flesh parts easily from the bone. </p> <p>Chop the parsley and rinse the capers. Lift out the fish onto warm plates and place the baking dish over a moderate flame. Scatter in the capers and parsley, squeeze in the lemon juice and grind in a little salt and pepper. Drizzle in a little extra virgin olive oil and bring very briefly to a fierce bubble. Tip the lot over the fish and serve. </p> <p><strong> Artichoke soup with ginger and walnuts</strong> </p> <p>This tastes creamy and rich, with only the smallest amount of butter. </p> <p><strong> serves 4-6</strong> </p> <p><strong>large leeks - 2<br> <br>butter - 40g<br> <br>medium sticks of celery - 4<br> <br>Jerusalem artichokes - 400g<br> <br>light stock or water - 1 litre<br> <br>a small bunch of parsley</strong> </p> <p><strong> for the spice-mix</strong> </p> <p><strong>coriander seeds - 1 tsp<br> <br>shelled walnuts - 30g<br> <br>fresh ginger - a 30g lump<br> <br>groundnut oil - 4 tsp</strong> </p> <p>Discard the toughest of the leaves from the leeks then cut into thin rounds. Rinse under running water, then add them with the butter to a heavy saucepan. Let the leeks cook in the butter over a low heat for a good 15 to 20 minutes till they are soft enough to crush between your fingers. </p> <p>Once they have started to soften, you can finely slice and add the celery, then peel and chop the artichokes and stir them in, too. Cover the pot with a lid so the vegetables sweat and soften without colouring, then pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down so the soup bubbles - partially cover with a lid. It will take about 25 minutes for the artichokes to become tender. </p> <p>Grind the coriander seeds to a fine powder with a pestle and mortar, then add the walnuts, mashing them briefly to a pulp. Peel the ginger and slice it thinly, then cut into thin matchsticks. Heat the oil in a shallow pan and fry the ginger for about 30 seconds till it is golden and crisp. Toss in the crushed walnuts and coriander, let them sizzle briefly then tip onto kitchen paper. </p> <p>Blitz the soup through a liquidiser or mouli, stir in the chopped parsley and check the seasoning. The soup should be mild, almost nutty tasting. Ladle into bowls and top with ginger spice mix. </p> <p><strong> Coffee and walnut cake</strong> </p> <p>Made with unsalted butter, unrefined sugar and free-range, organic eggs you will have something infinitely superior to any shop-bought cake. It will take about an hour from start to finish and will keep for several days if you keep it sealed. </p> <p><strong> serves 8-10</strong> </p> <p><strong>butter - 175g<br> <br>unrefined golden caster sugar - 175g<br> <br>walnut pieces - 65g<br> <br>eggs - 3<br> <br>self-raising flour - 175g<br> <br>baking powder - 1 tsp<br> <br>instant coffee granules - 2 tsp</strong> </p> <p><strong> for the filling:</strong> </p> <p><strong>butter - 200g<br> <br>icing sugar - 400g<br> <br>instant coffee granules - 2 tsp<br> <br>walnut pieces - 60g<br> <br>You will also need 2 x 20cm loose-bottomed sponge tins</strong> </p> <p>Beat the butter and sugar till light, pale and fluffy. You could do this by hand but it is far easier and, frankly, better with an electric mixer. Set the oven at 180 c/gas 4. Meanwhile, line the base of two 20cm sponge tins with greaseproof paper and chop the walnuts. Crack the eggs into a bowl, break them up with a fork, then add them a little at a time to the butter and sugar, beating well after each addition. </p> <p>Combine the flour and baking powder and mix into the butter and sugar, gently, with either the mixer on a slow speed or by hand with a large metal spoon. Dissolve the coffee granules in a tablespoon of boiling water, then stir into the cake. Chop the walnuts and fold gently into the cake. </p> <p>Divide the cake mixture between the two cake tins, smooth lightly and bake for 20-25 minutes. I have noticed mine are pretty much consistently done after 23 minutes. </p> <p><strong> To make the frosting</strong>: beat the butter till soft and pale with an electric beater, then add the sugar and beat till smooth and creamy. Stir a tablespoon of boiling water into the coffee granules then mix it into the butter-cream. Fold in the walnut pieces. When cool, turn one half of the cake upside down on a plate, spread it with a good third of the butter-cream, then place the second half on top. Spread the remaining butter cream on top and around the sides.</p>",
  "<p>Our table at Per Se in New York was terribly crowded. It wasn't the place setting, which was a model of simplicity: a glass or two, polished to a shine, a knife and a fork each, a flounce of pleated napkin. And it certainly wasn't the table itself, which was a snowfield of crisp, custom-made linen, with room for at least eight elbows, occupied tonight by just the four. </p> <p>It was the memories of all the other truly great meals I have eaten, clamouring around it, as if trying to get a look. It was the memory of the whole black truffle en croute at l'Auberge de l'Ill in Alsace, the eating of which made time stand still; it was the foie gras and crab biscuit and the pigeon pastilla at the Fat Duck in Bray; the Nantucket scallops in their own buttery juices at Craft on the other side of Manhattan; the whole suckling pig shared with friends at St John in London; the first puff of sweet steam from the chocolate and mint souffle at the Champignon Sauvage in Cheltenham, which started it all. </p> <p>And now here I was at Per Se, the new restaurant from Thomas Keller, the legendary chef of the French Laundry in California, itself regarded as the very best restaurant in America, twice named best restaurant on the planet by a panel of experts. Per Se means 'in and of itself' though this venture is nothing of the sort and never can be. The settings may be different - the chrome and glass gilding of the big city here, to the fields and wide open skies of the Napa Valley there - but Per Se and the French Laundry are still each other's siblings. They share the same DNA. Anyone ordering the $150 chef's tasting menu at Per Se would be entitled to expect greatness, to wonder whether they were sitting in what fellow American superstar chef Eric Ripert has already described as 'the greatest restaurant in the world'. Let's put it this way: I was rather looking forward to my dinner. </p> <p>And so it began, all 15 courses of it, though there were many more individual dishes than that, for Keller is famous for his jazz-style riffs on ingredients. Much of the time my companion Simon and I were given the same ingredients or idea, but realised in a different way. So, for example, to start, a fresh and creamy chilled onion soup for me, poured atop a quenelle of minced pickled apples, and for him, a soup of sweetcorn slicked with basil oil. Next, for me, a Keller signature dish called pearls and oysters: a single fat oyster in a rich, oniony sabayon of tapioca - the pearls - with a generous spoonful of caviar; for him (allergic to oysters, poor sap) a cauliflower panna cotta as a foil for the caviar. </p> <p>There are eggs: a soft-boiled hen's egg, with rich black truffle puree and melba toast for me, a white truffle oil-infused custard set in an open egg shell for him. We share a piece of striped black bass, cut to look like a lamb shank for presentation at the table with a sprig of thyme, then filleted and laid on a buttery tangle of roasted endive and almonds. We have the sweetest tails of Nova Scotia lobster, with sweeter garden carrots and peas for me and melted Savoy cabbage for him. There is a truly stunning fillet of Snake River Farm beef, with chanterelle mushrooms and a tiny, exquisite slice of a bread and bone marrow pudding on the side. </p> <p>Now it's time for pudding. I am brought a dish with what looks like a solid, shiny chocolate lid. The waiter sprinkles on crystals of Maldon sea salt and then dribbles very hot olive oil on top. It melts a hole in the middle to reveal a void in the bowl and at the bottom a scoop of delicate thyme ice cream. Simon gets a melting chocolate pudding with a scoop of olive oil ice cream. </p> <p>A sorbet each: one of fragrant hibiscus with an avocado coulis, another of quince with a yogurt panna cotta. Then two further chocolate dishes, one a brownie with coffee ice cream and caramel chocolate croustillant, another a combination of chocolate 'sweetened salty hazelnuts'. </p> <p>And this list is only the highest of the highlights, perhaps less than half of what we ate, all of it coordinated by as cheery and unstuffy a bunch of waiters as you could hope to find. At the end we were brought mint tea. We were offered hand-made chocolates. We were presented with bags of tiny flavoured meringues to take away, in case we were still feeling peckish on the short cab journey home. There were, of course, wines to accompany this: 13 of them in all. We arrived at 8.15pm and we left at a little after 12.30pm. </p> <p>The extraordinary thing about this is that by Per Se standards there was nothing extraordinary about it at all. This is what they do: dinners of 15 tiny courses, each no more than two or three mouthfuls, lasting four or five or even six hours. It's their shtick. So, was it the greatest meal in the world? Was it the best dinner I have ever eaten? Jesus, give me a break! It's only been a week. I'm still digesting. </p> <p>Above the door out of the kitchens at Per Se is an inscription. It reads 'Finesse. Noun: refinement and delicacy of performance, execution or artisanship'. I ask Keller about it when we meet the next day. He looks up at the sign and says simply, 'Life is all about finesse.' It certainly is if you're Thomas Keller. He's sodden with the stuff, has a bearing and poise uncommon among his professional tribe (even wearing his trademark black clogs) and an apparently unshakeable self-confidence. </p> <p>Per Se is situated in the $1.7 billion Time Warner Centre at New York's Columbus Circle on the southern corner of Central Park. It is a massive secular cathedral, glittering with the best retail opportunities money can buy and here nothing comes cheap, certainly not a top-end restaurant. Though his people prefer not to discuss money, it is said that Per Se cost around $12 million to open - very little of it Keller's - making it possibly the most expensive new restaurant on earth. All the crockery, with its hound's-tooth motif, is custom made, as is the linen and the silverware. The floors are of Italian bronzed tiles, the carpets unique, the kitchens unlike any I've ever seen. There might, therefore, be grounds for anxiety. If so, Keller doesn't show it. </p> <p>'If you're really happy with what you're doing does it matter what the critics say?' he asks. 'Or even what the guests say? If we're having a good night in the kitchen the by-product is your happiness.' It is perhaps easier to say this now that Frank Bruni, restaurant critic of The New York Times, has awarded Per Se four out of four stars, and admitted to being 'ineffably sad' at the finishing of a risotto of summer truffles during a meal there. In a city full of top-end restaurants, fewer than half a dozen have the top score. </p> <p>Even so, Keller does not appear to be a man swayed by the opinions of others; he has always followed his own path. Keller, who turns 49 this week, began his career aged just 17 in the kitchens of the Miami country club his mother managed, when the chef quit. For years he worked his way through kitchens in New England and New York, picking lowly jobs in top restaurants over loftier positions in less well-regarded places, before heading to France for a stint at the famed three-star Taillevent. 'Taillevent has been a model for me,' he says now, 'and my kitchen is modelled on that.' In the Eighties he returned to New York and opened Rakel (the name is a combination of his name and that of his then business partner Serge Raoul). It was there, Keller says, that he started developing his food philosophy. 'I reinterpreted the shrimp cocktail so it was true to the flavour profile of the dish but different. So there was a tomato consomme infused with horseradish and we grilled the shrimp and put it all in a highball glass.' </p> <p>Such culinary high jinks enthused the critics, but then came the Wall Street crash of 1987 and business collapsed. Within a few years, Serge Raoul had downgraded the restaurant to a neighbourhood bistro and Keller quit. It wasn't his thing. So he travelled about again, picking up consultancies he hated, and executive positions which didn't suit him. In 1991, while living in Los Angeles, he was told about a restaurant that was for sale in the Napa Valley town of Yountville. 'I went there, saw the French Laundry and somehow knew it was the place I was looking for all my life,' he later said. 'I remember thinking, Yeah, this is home.' </p> <p>He raised $600,000 from dozens of small investors, which he matched with bank loans, and then set to work creating the greatest restaurant in America, a place that would become famed for the hand-rolled cornets of salmon tartar and creme fraiche with which all his meals begin, and his delicate ways with panna cotta or walnut soups and, above all, the supreme quality of his ingredients. In October 1997 Ruth Reichl, then restaurant critic for The New York Times, said the French Laundry was 'the most exciting place to eat in the United States'. The reservation book filled up and stayed filled. </p> <p>Heston Blumenthal of the Fat Duck has eaten at the French Laundry twice. 'It is just possible,' he told me, 'that the best example of precise classical French cooking is not in France but in the United States.' As we talk Keller refers constantly to his 'philosophy' and I ask him to describe it. All his chefs are entitled to create dishes in a way that 'brings out the integrity of the product', he says, but they must 'not be intrusive on another course. There must be no repetition of any one item across a menu.' Really? 'Absolutely. When fava beans come in and I want to use them on a meat dish, someone else can't use them on fish. It pushes our imagination.' It also results in the most extraordinary list of dishes. Most restaurants have a couple of dozen on at any one time. The French Laundry - and now Per Se - has a repertoire of literally thousands. </p> <p>He has even written a declaration of intent for his staff describing the philosophy behind the myriad tasting menus. 'With each course we want to strike quick, mean and leave without getting caught,' he writes, like some Norman Mailer of the stove. 'All menus at the French Laundry revolve around the law of diminishing returns. That is the more you have of something the less you enjoy it.' So lots of tiny courses and lots of intense flavours. 'Imagine one carrot having as much sweet, earthy and fresh characteristic as a pound of carrots or a spoonful of pea soup with the impact of a thousand peas.' I don't need to imagine. I've tried it. </p> <p>In time, the French Laundry spawned a nearby baby brother, Bouchon, and then a bakery, and then another Bouchon in Las Vegas. Next came the approach from Kenneth Himmel, developer of the Time Warner Centre, who wanted to put together the greatest collection of restaurants in the world. He knew he had to have Keller, and Keller in turn was ready to return to New York, to vanquish the demons of Rakel's failure. 'It is part of America,' he says. 'You've got to be ambitious, you've got to move on. I suppose I wanted to find out how hard I could make it for myself and how hard I could be on my staff.' Plus, as an incentive, he was given complete power to choose who else would be in the collection. </p> <p>'It wasn't about wielding that power,' he says. 'It was about making sure we had like minds around us.' One of the criticisms of Per Se is that it is, essentially, a restaurant in a shopping mall. All Keller will say about this is that 'if the Centre succeeds we all succeed' but there is no doubt that he has tried to stack the house in his favour. So the famed Charlie Trotter will open his first restaurant outside Chicago downstairs from Per Se. There's a steakhouse from Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and a Japanese place called Masa offering tasting menus at $240 a pop. The Time Warner restaurant collection is so top end, so damn bling, it hurts. </p> <p>But for a while it was almost dead before it started. A week after Per Se officially opened in February a fire ripped through the kitchen, closing it down for four months. 'We had also closed the French Laundry for four months so we could bring all the staff out here to train up the new lot to send back,' Keller says. 'Now we had no way of training them.' But somehow they got back on track. </p> <p>He takes me into the kitchen, through the 'breezeway', a corridor specially created to give the waiters a chance to adjust from the clatter of the kitchen to the hush of the dining room. He leads me round, introducing chefs, telling me that his job is to make them the best they can be, to pass on leadership skills. The company now has a staff of over 500 across America, a leap from the dozen or so he started with at the French Laundry. At one point he tells me he has acquired an executive coach, and I hope he means he's bought himself a fancy car. But in fact an executive coach is someone who teaches people like Keller how to run large companies. 'It's something I need to be able to do,' he says. </p> <p>Keller clearly loves this management stuff. He shows me the manuals for his employees, hundreds of pages on fish and cheese and meat and how to serve them; the correct way to store ingredients; how to lay tables. And that's before you get to the recipes. All are now online, on a protected website. Soon there will be video link between the French Laundry and Per Se so Keller can see what's going on. </p> <p>They also keep track of thousands of meals, making lists of what many of their key diners have had and when. I am startled. Really? 'Oh yes'. He pulls up sheets of menus from the night before. They even have ours, which he presents me with. This is when the system becomes a little less shiny, reassuringly a touch less professional. For example our two menus mix up a number of the dishes that we had. One course - the cheese - is completely wrong. And there, two courses apart on my menu, is proof that the philosophy of non-repetition doesn't always work in the heat of service. Horror: I was served Cipollini onions twice. I thought it was a neat bit of conscious self-reference. From the look on Keller's face, though, this is clearly a screw up. 'Damn,' he says. 'If I hadn't told you, you wouldn't have known.' </p> <p>Errant Cipollini onions aside, is Per Se the best place to eat dinner on the planet? Was this my greatest meal ever? Is Thomas Keller the best chef in the world? No, no and no. This is not the damning criticism it looks like. When I ask Keller himself how it feels to be described as the best chef in the world he responds repeatedly as if I had asked him what it feels like to be merely 'one of the best chefs in the world.' He says 'I accept my place in that list because enough people have said it. Thing is, I go to work every day just as I have done for 25 years. It's that experience that has made me one of the best.' </p> <p>The problem, as ever, is hype. If Per Se were in France, it would be regarded as a top player. I have no doubt it would have three Michelin stars and Keller would be spoken of alongside the likes of Pierre Gagnaire, Michel Bras and Marc Veyrat. But because he is in the US, he stands proud of the pack. He has to be the biggest, the most accomplished. </p> <p>The truth is that not everything works. The 15-course dinner idea sounds great in principle but, in practice, creates an unmeetable challenge. It is impossible for every course to deliver, and so it proved with our meal. A dish of 'grouper cheek' in a chickpea crust was underwhelming - two so-what fragments of fish goujon. The 'salad' course was some pretty inconsequential ingredients, shepherded together for no good reason. And, as ever in the US, the cheese was just plain lousy.</p> <p>But that is to judge the restaurant by its hype. I will never forget the striped bass dish, or the beef, or the foie gras, or the oysters and pearls or the lobster. And the chocolate dish with the hot olive oil was truly inspired. If my meal had been just those dishes, it may well have been the best I had ever eaten but because of the others it wasn't. Will Thomas Keller care what I think? I doubt it. He's too centred for that, too focused to let my opinion get in the way. And it's exactly this that makes him one of the best chefs in the world.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The French Laundry Cookbook by Thomas Keller is published by Workman at \u00a340.

  "<p>Before I met Francesco, when I'd only seen a preview tape of his forthcoming television series, I thought he looked like a joke - or a pretend Italian - possibly from stock specially bred by the BBC for use in TV presenting. Handsome, with a shock of white hair, given to enthusiastic gesticulation, he speaks with a heavy eetalian accent and smokes on television. And then I arrived in Venice and realised he's about as authentic as you could possibly get. </p> <p>Francesco's family, the da Mostos, have figured in the life of the city for as long as records have been kept. They probably arrived with the first settlers in the Venice lagoon escaping from Attila the Hun; they became merchants and courtesans, adventurers and academics. The oldest remaining palace on the Grand Canal, the Ca' da Mosto, was owned by the family for generations until 1603. The family now owns another palace, with a door onto a canal and a boat outside, with splendid staircases and frescoes and more than a hint of decay. </p> <p>So it would be hard to think of a better guide to Venetian food than Francesco. We meet, romantically enough, in the middle of the Rialto Bridge. Francesco has promised to show me the palaces and churches, the bridges and back canals, but first he wants to take me to where it all started - to the salt marshes of the lagoon, where the first settlers built houses on stilts and survived on fish. </p> <p>We're not surviving on our own efforts today, so we cross the bridge to the Rialto market, where the rich lagoon stocks of fish are brought, as they have been for centuries. (Seven of the largest rivers in the Mediterranean flowed into the lagoon originally, offering freshwater, lagoon and sea fishing.) The covered market is a 15th-century building with a high wood-beamed roof, stone columns, ancient paving stones and tables covered with shiny sea bass, plump crayfish, bowls of baby black squid in ink, slippery sardines and pink Adriatic tuna. </p> <p>Nino, Francesco's usual fishmonger, comes from Burano, an island that maintains its historic industry (unlike so much of Venice, with its increasingly self-defeatingly tourism-focused economy). The son of a fisherman, Nino has run this stall in the market for 46 years, with his brother and, latterly, his son. Most of Venice's fishermen come from Burano, an island easily identified from the water by its leaning campanile, which is where Francesco, his English wife Jane and three children sometimes go for breakfast when they've stayed out on the lagoon overnight. </p> <p>Nino could easily be 20 years younger than his actual 61. (When I express surprise at his age, he offers to let me feel his biceps, which, even unflexed, are terrifyingly enormous and rigid.) He gets up at 2.30 every morning and takes a boat over to the wholesale fish market at Trochetto, then comes on to the Rialto market. Now he and Francesco sniff fish, look at gills and debate for a bit. We're tempted by crayfish but Francesco is squeamish about killing them on the barbecue, so we settle for sardines, with which Francesco plans to make bigoli in salsa, a Venetian pasta dish; and, for the main course, some pale pink tuna. </p> <p>Francesco and I carry the fish round the corner to the Palazzo Baglioni, the da Mosto home. Francesco's parents live on the first floor, Francesco and his family on the second; they rent out some 15 to 20 apartments at the top of the building. Francesco produces a key as big as my hand and opens a vast wooden door into a wide chamber the length of a block, at the opposite end another set of double doors give onto a glaucous green canal. The tide is coming in, so he slips into some yellow wellies to pull the boat to the jetty, which is now under water. When boats pass, the wake splashes through the doors to the bottom of the internal steps. </p> <p>Under medieval bridges, we inch through canals towards the lagoon. Francesco is careful to keep to the speed limits because the police have started using laser guns. (Parking is also a problem: if you moor in a space someone considers theirs, they have a habit of simply untying your boat and letting it drift away.) We cross the water, leaving behind the towers and Byzantine arches, heading towards islets of the outer lagoon. </p> <p>About four years ago Francesco and his wife Jane, an environmental scientist, bought a bit of land on an island so unimportant that it doesn't have a name. The plot wasn't huge, but it was mostly surrounded by water, with views only of reed beds and white herons, straggling brambles, a jetty and a large shed. Soon afterwards, the shed blew down, so Francesco rebuilt it, using some materials salvaged from Venice, including a window from a palace on the Grand Canal. It's still only a shed, there's no electricity, and being here is like camping, but they love it. </p> <p>Jane, the children, Francesco's parents and the da Mosto cat arrive in a water taxi. Ranieri da Mosto, Francesco's father, shares the family sense (which may be a Venetian sense) that the heyday of the Venetian Republic was only a short time ago. He and Francesco both talk about their ancestors as if they knew them - the one who discovered Cape Verde, the one who fought to keep the Murano glassmakers in Venice, the one who was arrested for raucous picnicking with nuns. </p> <p>Ranieri worked for Rai, the state broadcaster, and presented a programme about food. He wrote a cookery book, Veneto in Cucina. To understand the food of Venice, he tells me, you have to understand the people, and how a band of refugees from Atilla the Hun came to command the most powerful civilisation in Europe - where, up until the eighteenth century, the standard of living was four times higher than anywhere else in Europe. </p> <p>It all started with salt. The lagoon was ideal for salt pans - shallow basins that could be opened to allow in the tide, then closed so the water could evaporate. At a time when salt was crucial for preserving as well as flavouring food, it was also extremely hard to come by. Soon, Venice dominated the salt trade in Europe. The connections with the Byzantine empire meanwhile meant that, between 500 and 1000, Venice also controlled European access to spices from the Orient. 'Rich people ate more highly spiced food than now, just to show they could,' Ranieri says, adding that spices retain a mystery for Venetians, and 'simple people' will put three or four peppercorns on their tongue when they feel a cold coming on. 'He says \"simple people\",' Jane tells me, 'but he does it. It seems to work, too.' </p> <p>There was a saying, Ranieri says, that nothing was born of Venice, but that you could find everything there. That nothing was born of Venice is not, of course, true. The fishermen who work on the neighbouring mud bank have found a dozen early-season soft-shell crabs for us, which Francesco's mother has dipped in flour and fried for four minutes. After all this talk of salt, Jane produces a packet of Maldon sea salt to sprinkle over them. But even with this English innovation, the crabs are perfect: the skins crusty only from frying and the delicately perfumed flesh melting inside. </p> <p>At the peak of the Republic's wealth and influence, food was, above all, sumptuous. Peacocks (which Ranieri has eaten twice and says are delicious) and oysters were highly prized and risotto was commonly served with gold leaf. Some 40 per cent of the population was literate, compared to three per cent elsewhere in Europe; Venice was the centre of publishing. 'This is where the literature of gastronomy began,' Ranieri says. 'There are hundreds of thousands of cookbooks from that time in the Marciana Library in Venice.' </p> <p>Then Venice got poorer. Only 10 years after Napoleon arrived in 1810, a visiting French journalist reported that half the Venetian population was begging in the streets. 'It was said even mothers would sell their own daughters,' Francesco says, 'and Byron came and bought about 30 of them.' Only the simple and cheap foods survived: fish, liver, polenta, risotto. </p> <p>The bigoli in salsa arrives: buckwheat spaghetti coated in pounded anchovies and onion, with raisins and pine nuts to sweeten the aggressiveness of the fish. We eat it with breadsticks, descendants of the biscotto, the twice-baked everlasting ship's biscuits that kept a trading empire alive. The recipe for the biscuits, Ranieri tells me, was handed down from father to son until someone died suddenly at the end of the 18th century without passing it on. Francesco has already told me that in 1821 a supply was found in a bricked-up Venetian fortress in Crete and was perfectly edible. Ranieri claims another stock was found in 1942 and was also quite tasty. </p> <p>For pudding, Francesco whips up some sgroppino from lemon ice cream, prosecco and a dash of vodka (tip ingredients into a bowl and attack with a balloon whisk). This half-drink, half-pudding takes its name from the word 'groppo' which means an indigestion-inspired lump in your throat. 'When you have eaten too much,' Francesco explains, 'it de-lumps your throat.' </p> <p>Happily and mildly drunkenly de-lumped, we take the boat across the creek to see Emiliano, who's given us the crabs. Improbably beautiful, he has a face from a Bellini painting, blond curls and fisherman's biceps. A friend of his, he tells me, married a girl from Norwich, but she left. It wasn't to do with whether she liked Venice, he adds: either you're in love for life or you're not. By now I am ready to faint with romance. </p> <p>Emilio, as they call him, is working with his uncle Marco, sitting on the deck of a boat with sacks of crabs. They learnt everything there is to know about crabbing from Marco's father, Emilio's grandfather. Not so many people collect the crabs today as it's so labour-intensive. Now they're separating out the females, which don't shed their shells. This would take me several days, because the only slight difference is that the females are a bit fatter underneath. </p> <p>The female crabs ( mazzenette ), are boiled for 15 minutes, and the flesh scooped out. The males go into wooden baskets and dangle in the water off the side of the boat until they're ready to shed their shells. They must be checked twice a day: Emilio shows me some that have just shed and says if he doesn't take them out of the water, they'll absorb calcium and be hard by tomorrow morning. </p> <p>I worry that they've got an enormous amount to sort - five sacks - but Emilio says this is nothing. Last week, when the weather was bad, they had 30. The size of the catch depends on the moon (the tides are stronger at full moon, meaning more crabs) and the season. The male crabs shed their shells twice a year, in autumn and spring. I ask Emilio if he likes his job, thinking perhaps I might consider a move to Burano to become a fisherwoman and sit on a deck all day sorting moeche in the sunshine. He looks at me sceptically. 'What you have to remember,' he says, 'is that we also have to do it when it's foggy and raining, flooding and cold.' </p> <p>Emilio and Marco sell their moeche - 'the caviar of the lagoon', Francesco calls them - for \u20ac50 a kilo. Emilio says no one cooks them like his mum, but a good way to eat them is in pastella, a kind of pancake mix. You throw the crabs in and they 'stuff themselves and suffocate', he explains, 'and then you have the eggy mixture inside and out.' While the children go off to look at some kittens - Emilio's cat has made a nest for them in the fishing nets - he shows us how he fishes for vongole, with a net on a kind of rake. The spikes disturb the sediment and the net catches whatever is lying in the mud, which is mostly stones. I can barely lift the pole, but Emilio says sometimes he does it for hours at a time. There is a Venetian saying, he adds, 'healthy like a fish'. </p> <p>Next morning, I leave the Hotel Cipriani (quite reluctantly, because it's so fabulously luxurious and I'd really like to loiter by the pool and gaze across the water at the views a bit longer) and take the hotel's speedboat-shuttle over to St Mark's Square. From there it's a short walk over the Grand Canal to the Palazzo Baglioni. Francesco and I sit and talk in his vast book-lined studio. </p> <p>Francesco still isn't entirely sure how or why he is about to present his personal view of Venice on British television. A BBC crew came to interview him for something else entirely, and then three months later a proposal arrived for a series of personal films on the history and architecture, character and future of Venice. </p> <p>They must have identified him immediately as a natural presenter: unselfconscious, restlessly interested, vibrant, good-looking, and steeped in the city. He was born in Venice and grew up in this palazzo; he walked to school and university, where he studied to be an architect. 'Sometimes, though, there comes a moment that you have to get away,' he says. 'Venice is a little heavy at a certain point. You feel the past. It can be damaging psychologically.' So he took time out from studying to wash dishes in London, to work in film in Rome and Paris, to skipper a boat, to travel in Africa. In 1992, he was about to make a film with Jacque Tati's son, Pierre, when Pierre was killed in a motorbike accident. He decided to return to Venice and take his final exams. </p> <p>His architecture finals project was a plan for the restoration of the Palazzo Baglioni, on which he is working as money becomes slowly available. He has begun at the top, with the artists' studios under the roof, and now plans to install a glass lift (the top of the building can currently be reached only by climbing 150 stairs). </p> <p>For five years after he graduated, Francesco ran the public works department of Venice. He met Jane, who was working for an environmental economics think tank in Milan. After falling out with the public works department for 'being asked to sign things I didn't want to sign', he set up on his own in this studio. He has worked on the rebuilding of La Fenice under Aldo Rossi, designed the Luxembourg pavilion for the Biennale, and completed a number of restorations. </p> <p>Venetian palaces were designed to combine splendour with functionality, to be at once warehouses and living quarters for large families. He takes me up to his parents' apartment and I feel a sense of incredulity that anyone in the 21st century might live in an apartment like this. The ceilings are impossibly high, the walls covered with frescoes, and there are wall-sized windows of leaded glass at either end of the central room, the piano nobile. Off this chamber is a room - covered in leather wallpaper - that was used for the filming of The Talented Mr Ripley. </p> <p>After this, we need another prosecco, so we head round the corner to Cantina Do Mori (The Two Moors), a narrow bar with an entrance onto a street at either end. It's customary to come here for a glass of wine and perhaps a snack in the late morning (when you should drink white wine; if you come in the evening you're supposed to drink red). I ask Sergio Fanello, the tall, silver-haired barman, how long the bar has been in existence. 'Since 1462,' he says. </p> <p>It probably hasn't changed much. There's nowhere to sit, just a bar stretching the length of the room, from the wooden doors with bottle glass in them at one end to identical doors at the other. Behind the bar are barrels of wine and bottles stacked from floor to ceiling. Locals - including lawyers from the nearby courthouse - still come in for a mid-morning snack or a light lunch. Do Mori sells cicchetti, the Venetian version of tapas: baby artichokes in season, slices of pecorino or polenta, tomato bruschetta, boiled salt cod mashed with oil to make a paste and spread on toast. </p> <p>Francesco takes me from here on a short tour of the city. He describes himself as 'a historian of the little things'. He didn't much like history at school and came to it by ferreting around in the Venice archives in pursuit of the history of his family and palazzo and discovering the thrill of, for example, turning up a document about a dispute over the noise made by barrels outside his window in the thirteenth century. When you're only in a city for a couple of days, it's often the little things that make it come alive. Scurrying through the backstreets, Francesco points out the water-borne vegetable sellers on a boat near the Ponte dei Pugni. </p> <p>The Tiozzo brothers (Fulvio, Gino and Ernesto) and their father have been selling vegetables under this bridge for half a century. From the traditional type of a boat known as a bragozzo, you can buy baskets of herbs - sage, thyme, oregano and mint - orange zucchini blossoms, fat porcini, shiny nearly-black aubergines, bunches of densely red peperoncini, peppery rucola and boxes of frutti di bosco. Many of their vegetables come from the island of Sant'-Erasmo, famous for castraure, baby artichokes so tender they can be eaten whole. </p> <p>We cross the Ponte delle Tette, the bridge of the tits, where the prostitutes used to flaunt themselves bare-breasted from windows and balconies (encouraged by the Republic in the 18th century in a bid to reduce sodomy) and into the quarter known as Carampane, where the brothels were clustered. </p> <p>Here, in a restaurant called the Trattoria Antiche Carampane, we are to have lunch. The waitress, Antonia, comes out and tells us what's on offer today: a choice of three dishes for the antipasti and three for the primi piatti. Everybody's husband, Jane informs me, is in love with Antonia, because there's something so effortlessly welcoming about her, 'and she's already decided what you're going to eat before she tells you what there is'. </p> <p>There are no printed menus, and a sign outside announces that the place doesn't serve spaghetti bolognese, lasagne or pizza. In fact, in Venetian dialect, it actually says: 'We really don't know how to make pizza because we're too stupid to learn.' </p> <p>The owner, Piera Bortoluzzi Librai, doesn't own a freezer. She and her son Francesco go every morning to the fish market and decide what to buy. Today there happened to be a lot of excellent scampi and with these she has made a fish soup, which is evidently one of the things that Antonia has decided I'll eat. </p> <p>It is without doubt the best fish soup I've ever tasted. Piera tells me she made it by first slowly frying some onions and leeks with the heads and shells of the scampi, then throwing in some cognac and setting it on fire, then adding water, thyme, salt and a little chilli. After boiling this for 20 minutes, she whizzed up the mixture with a metal blade and strained the liquid through a muslin. In another pan, she quickly fried the scampi, whizzed them up, added them to the broth, and left the soup simmering. She made little breadballs with chopped scampi, parsley, lemon, garlic, pepper, breadcrumbs and beaten egg white and threw them in, too. </p> <p>I trail back to the Cipriani for a last hour of luxury, feeling astonishingly well-fed. I've been to the city before, but never with this kind of insight, and certainly never eating so well. </p> <p>Francesco isn't particularly optimistic about the future of his city. He thinks Venice can be saved from drowning: 'We've been to the moon; I should think we could stop a city from flooding.' The more disturbing question is what kind of city it will be. A population of 170,000 in the 1950s has declined to a mere 64,000 now. There are no substantial companies here any more. You pass the odd workshop of a furniture maker, or a paper maker, but even the traditional crafts are in decline. 'There are people with a real life here, and we have to help them,' Francesco says. 'There ought to be tax breaks for start-up businesses. Tourism exists, but you cannot have all the people working in tourism, or you destroy the character of the people and ultimately, of the place.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, for those of us who are privileged to be tourists in Venice, he has three pieces of advice: 'Number one: come into the city on the water, not by car. (Get a water taxi from the airport.) Number two: come in the autumn, between September and November, when there are fewer people. And number three: allow yourself to wander and wander until you get lost.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Francesco's Venice, published by BBC Books, costs \u00a325.

  "<p>It's an image familiar to every TV viewer - Anthony Hicks, 58, real-life front man of the Government's Quit Smoking campaign, propped in a hospital bed with his voicebox removed, eyes sunken, skin the colour of tobacco smoke, croaking intermittently about plans to spend Christmas with his daughter. Ten days later, the caption tells us, Anthony is dead - killed by cancer of the lung and larynx, a compliant victim of his own smoking habit. </p> <p>There is no ambiguity in the NHS message - and those of us who don't smoke breathe a sigh of relief (because we can). We walk to the kitchen, take a ready-made lasagne from the fridge, place it in the microwave; if we're feeling generous to ourselves, we might fry a fillet steak in a little butter, eat it (guiltily) with a plateful of oven chips and treat ourselves to a can of lager and a tub of chocolate chip ice cream. </p> <p>Unwittingly, we are placing ourselves in the same high-risk category as Anthony - victims not of cigarette smoke but of our Western diet. In its World Cancer Report, published last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) quietly dropped the bombshell that 30 per cent of cancers in the West can be attributed to dietary factors - placing food second only to tobacco as a preventable cause of cancer. If we all improved our diet overnight (dream on), 2.1 million lives a year could be saved. Instead of 20 million people worldwide suffering from cancer, the figure could be 14 million (and a further half of those could be avoided by also banning smoking). Of the 10 million new cases every year, three million could be prevented by eating wisely. </p> <p>What's more, as Western-style diets take hold in developing countries, they too are at increased risk of cancer. The evidence, says Sara Hiom, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, is in various migration studies conducted with Japanese women, who are prone to far lower rates of breast cancer than those in the West. 'Within one generation of migrating to America,' Hiom explains, 'their breast cancer risk was that of the indigenous population of America.' </p> <p>This and other environmental factors have put us in the grip of a global cancer epidemic. By 2020, new cases are expected to rise from 10 million to 15 million a year. Within 20 years, the number of people living with cancer is projected to increase from 20 million to 30 million. All this could be prevented, the WHO implies, by giving up our drip-feed of fast, processed and convenience foods which are high in fat, sugar and salt. </p> <p>Even if we consume none of these, we cannot feel smug. As we unpack our organic boxes and make our Saturday-morning forays to farmers' markets in search of free-range poultry, low-fat ostrich steaks and wholemeal bread, another danger lurks in the drinks cabinet. After obesity (cited by Cancer Research UK as an 'absolutely cast-iron' cause of the illness), excess alcohol consumption - defined by the WHO as 'more than two units a day' - is the biggest risk factor in cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver and breast. Anthony Hicks, heavy smoker, RIP. </p> <p>So there we were worrying about our children's heart disease, stroke and diabetes as a result of 'the obesity epidemic', when all along cancer was a cast-iron risk. But what can we feed our ill-fated progeny to prevent it? </p> <p>In our unhealthy but strangely health-obsessed world, there is no shortage of suggestions. Broccoli is often cited by nutritionists and health writers as a kind of wonder vegetable because it contains vitamins A, C and E - a hat trick of antioxidants, compounds that 'scavenge' free radicals (oxygen particles that can damage body cells and possibly cause cancer). Butternut squash and sweet potato also score three out of three and, like most fruits and vegetables pigmented orange and yellow, are sources of beta-carotene - one of a group of antioxidants known as carotenoids. In fact, the body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A, which is found in green leafy vegetables among other things. </p> <p>Another carotenoid with potential is lycopene, which is present in tomatoes. Some studies have suggested it may reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Tomatoes contain vitamin A and vitamin C as well, making them a doubly valuable addition to the arsenal. If your children can't stand fresh tomatoes, though, don't worry: several studies have shown that the processing of tomatoes makes lycopene more readily available for the body to use, so ketchup, tomato sauce and pizza topping (which make up three-quarters of the lycopene intake of Americans) are just as likely to prevent cancer. </p> <p>Red peppers are excellent for vitamins A and C, while selenium (a mineral) is present in many plants, including broccoli, beets, cabbage and garlic as well as nuts, offal, fish, eggs and poultry. A review study in 2001 reported that selenium, an essential trace element, is necessary for the functioning of an enzyme that protects against oxidative damage to cell structures. In animals, it reduced the frequency of transplanted tumours and may provide protection in the later stages of human cancer. </p> <p>Several other plant compounds (phytochemicals) have shown promise in the fight against cancer, albeit in limited trials in the laboratory and in animals. Glucosinolates (from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and pak choi) confer various health benefits while indole-3-carbinole, another constituent of these vegetables, has been shown to prevent colon cancer in mouse models. Flavonoids are another promising group. Quercetin (found in apples, onions, tea and red wine) blocks the hormone activity in human prostate cancer cells, while allicin (the main ingredient in crushed garlic) has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human cancer cells in the colon, endometrium and breast. </p> <p>In May, a study by Professor Ian Johnson for the Institute of Food Research found that a substance called allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC) stops colon cancer cells dividing relentlessly - the mechanism that causes tumours. AITC - a breakdown compound of sinigrin (found in brassicas such as broccoli, mustard, cabbage, horseradish, cauliflower, kale and wasabi) - is produced when particular vegetables are chopped, chewed, cooked or digested. Unlike chemotherapy drugs, it appears to target tumour cells without damaging healthy cells. </p> <p>Despite this growing body of research, the World Health Organisation offers no advice about specific plant foods in its 2003 report. It simply lists fruits and vegetables - generally - as one dietary factor that may decrease the risk of cancer of the oral cavity, stomach and colorectum. Eat plenty of these (as traditional hunter-gatherers did, consuming more than 800 different plant-based foods on a regular basis) and you may be protected. It is what is lacking in our food - the vitamins, minerals, fibre, phytochemicals and micro-nutrients in a plant-based diet - that counts. </p> <p>But surely working out what we need to eat to boost our chances can't be rocket science. If we know there are lower incidences of cancer in certain parts of the world, such as Japan and rural China, we can monitor what those populations are eating and identify what it is that we are doing wrong. </p> <p>At the Oxford University laboratories of Cancer Research UK, principal scientist Professor Tim Key is doing precisely that. 'All our work here - and cancer epidemiology everywhere - is based on that premise,' he says. 'The reason we bother doing our work is that cancer rates vary around the world and have also varied with time in some countries - so it's clearly not genetics that determine it but something about lifestyle. Diet is one of the top candidates on the list.' </p> <p>With such a bleak epidemic looming, the subject is being researched with a vengeance. In one project, Epic (the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition), scientists are analysing the food questionnaires of half a million people in 10 European countries to shed light on the links between diet and long-term health. The results are due in the next few years. Coordinated by the WHO and supported by the European Union, Epic is the largest such study ever undertaken - and Professor Tim Key is principal investigator of the Oxford cohort, a group of 65,000 human guinea pigs . </p> <p>If anyone can help devise a cancer-busting diet, it is Professor Key - but his suggestions are conservative to say the least. The risk inherent in obesity is 'absolutely cast-iron and confirmed to be true', he says. 'For breast cancer in menopausal women in particular, obesity increases blood levels of oestrogen - and oestrogen is directly linked to breast cancer risk. The link with alcohol is also confirmed, so keep your weight down and don't drink too much.' </p> <p>Eating lots of fruit and vegetables (as the WHO suggests) is 'only a probable', he says, 'and for no specific [plant] food is there convincing evidence that it's important'. Red meat is under 'serious investigation', he adds, because 'there is quite a lot of evidence that high intakes of meat - and it's stronger for processed and preserved meat than for fresh meat - may increase the risk of large bowel cancer. It's a hot topic of research.' </p> <p>And what about boosting soya intake and cutting down on dairy products, like the rural Chinese who are less at risk from breast cancer? Of the first, he says the evidence 'has not been very strong' while the second is 'an interesting area'. I mention Professor Jane Plant's book Your Life in Your Hands, in which she puts forward a persuasive argument that giving up dairy produce helped her survive five diagnoses of breast cancer, but Professor Key is not convinced. 'In less developed countries where there isn't much food around,' he says, 'women start menstruating at a late age, they have several children and breastfeed them for a long time. These factors are all known to reduce breast cancer risk. Worldwide variation is not just to do with diet.' </p> <p>It isn't the Holy Grail I am looking for, and I begin to wonder about all those cancer-busting carotenoids, flavonoids and phytochemicals cited by health writers and nutritionists. Isn't there a shred of truth in it? 'Everyone wants to know which fruits and vegetables they should be eating,' Professor Key acknowledges. 'Is it brassicas, is it garlic? None of these things are sorted out. Reports in the media and in scientific journals are usually based on a single study which may identify an interesting effect in a laboratory - but that doesn't mean it will work in people. The only scientifically based advice we can give is: 'Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, and base your choice on the ones you like and can afford.' </p> <p>It's good advice, but no good at all to those of us who are indecisive in the supermarket aisle (or who never look at price labels). But in California, naturally, the selection of nutritionally perfect fruit and veg has been perfected as a science. David Heber, MD, a scientist at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition in Los Angeles, has devised a formula to help consumers with the weekly shop. In his review article 'Vegetables, fruits and phytoestrogens in the prevention of disease' (published in the Journal of Postgraduate Medicine ), he divides foods into seven colour categories and suggests we eat one type from each group every day - red (tomatoes and related products), red/purple (berries, grapes, red wine), orange (carrots, mangoes, pumpkin), orange/yellow (cantaloupe, peaches, oranges, papaya), yellow/green (spinach, avocado, honeydew), green (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower) and white/green (leeks, onion, garlic, chives). </p> <p>Apart from the red wine (presumably less than two glasses a day), it is not so different from the superfoods programme outlined by Dr Steven Pratt, a Californian plastic surgeon, in his book, Superfoods: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life. It recommends a diet of 14 colourful foods (such as broccoli, tomatoes, pumpkin, soy, spinach, wild salmon, oranges and black tea) containing the range of nutrients we need. Though mainly for weight loss, the diet 'can change the course of your biochemistry', Dr Pratt claims. 'These foods can help stop the cellular damage that can develop into disease,' he says - an optimism shared by Katherine Tallmadge of the British Dietetic Association. 'The reasoning sounds good,' she says. 'These are the kinds of healthy wholefoods we should be eating.' </p> <p>The truth is, few of us will heed this advice, somehow believing that cancer will strike elsewhere - and in the distant future. We have organic muesli for breakfast, we eat up our greens (once or twice a week). Why should it happen to us? For one group of people, however, the link between cancer and diet is real. Already diagnosed, often with weeks or months to live, they will seize dietary advice with both hands because it may prevent secondary tumours occurring and brace their immune systems for the toxic onslaught of orthodox chemotherapy. </p> <p>Michele Eve, 40, a mother of three living in Bristol, was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago this month and immediately went on a cancer-busting diet. She was not prepared to wait for the randomised, double-blind placebo trials of over-cautious scientists to tell her what she should be eating. </p> <p>'I was in a bookshop,' she says, 'and the first book I picked up was about the Bristol Cancer Help Centre. I just feel so lucky that it's in my home town.' </p> <p>While undergoing chemotherapy ('I was very ill indeed,' she says) and eventually surgery, Michele adopted the lifestyle changes recommended by the holistic charity. In addition to counselling and complementary therapies (including shiatsu, meditation and spiritual healing), these involved switching to a plant-based, wholefood diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, pulses and whole grains but very little meat and dairy produce. 'I gave up fish as well and went completely vegan,' she says, 'though that was my choice.' </p> <p>Four years later (and just one year short of being medically 'clear'), Michele is completely well - something she attributes both to orthodox treatment and the Bristol approach. 'When they took the lump out, the specialist couldn't believe it,' she says. 'All the cancer cells had gone - which is very unusual. He seemed amazed, but I wasn't. I think the diet helped me fight the cancer and it was the one thing I could do something about immediately when everything else was up in the air. When given a 50:50 chance, you ask yourself \"Which half am I going to be in, then?\" You can make a choice.' </p> <p>On a damp, doleful September day, I make my way to Bristol and find the reception area of the Bristol Cancer Help Centre suffused with natural light. There is something about the tall windows, high ceilings and minimalist decor of the former convent that makes it seem sunnier indoors than out - and when I peer into the relaxation room, where participants in a five-day residential course are sharing their experiences of cancer, I notice they are sitting not on polypropylene chairs (standard issue in institutions) but reclining sun loungers arranged like radiating spokes around a nutrition therapist. </p> <p>'Would you like a drink?' asks Clare Ben jamin, who has invited me here to find out about Michele Eve's diet. </p> <p>'A coffee would be nice,' I say, but the request is met with an apologetic smile and a tray of herbal teas. </p> <p>At once I am reminded of the lack of consensus when it comes to treating cancer with diet. In the best-known and most controversial approach, Gerson therapy (invented by German-born doctor Max Gerson in the Thirties), coffee is the very thing that is believed to work - albeit administered by enema rather than bone-china cup. When combined with a strict nutritional regime - principally 13 glasses of fruit juice a day and injections of vitamin B12 and liver extract - coffee is said to dilate the bile ducts in the liver and help it excrete cancer-causing toxins. </p> <p>In June, Prince Charles provoked a venomous attack by the medical establishment for suggesting Gerson therapy had worked for a cancer sufferer he knew and merited further research. 'I have no time at all for \"alternative\" therapy that places itself above the laws of evidence,' blustered Professor Michael Baum of University College London. 'The power of my authority comes with a knowledge built on 40 years of study and 25 years of active involvement in cancer. Your power and authority rest on an accident of birth.' </p> <p>Professor Karol Sikora, Britain's most eminent cancer specialist, was equally damning of the diet, saying there was no rationale for it. 'Why would a coffee enema work?' he asked. 'It's popular at the higher end of the middle classes, partly because it's expensive and there's an element of religious mania to it. But the idea that huge amounts of vitamin C can cure you of cancer is wrong.' </p> <p>Yet here at the Bristol Cancer Help Centre (where sufferers are urged to take supplements of 500-2,000mg of vitamin C a day, in addition to seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables), Professor Sikora is an ally. Visit the centre's website and there he is in his lilac shirt, clashing tie and serious spectacles, saying: 'Bristol represents the gold standard for complementary care in cancer.' Climbing the stairs, I pause on the landing beneath a portrait of HRH, the centre's patron. Somehow, the Bristol Approach satisfies both sides in a polarised and very angry debate. When I ask even the most conservative cancer specialists about the centre's dietary advice, nobody is prepared to knock it. </p> <p>'Well, we're not exactly making people eat live lizards,' says Jane Sen, the professional chef and cookery writer who helped devise the Bristol guidelines. Looking at our lunch menu, chalked on a blackboard in the award-winning restaurant (the centre was named Caterer of the Year in 2000 by BBC Radio 4's Food programme), I can see what she means. I'm not a great fan of soybean curd, but Malay-spiced tofu with aubergine, mustard-seed rice, sesame stir-fried broccoli, red pepper, spinach and sprout salad doesn't sound bad, even when lightly drizzled with peanut vinaigrette. I ask Jane Sen what is so cancer-busting about it. </p> <p>'The colour is important,' she insists, 'because a colourful plateful [green broccoli, bright red peppers] means you are eating a variety of ingredients and getting all the plant nutrients you need. Make sure you have something raw in every meal [like the shredded spinach in this one] because raw food still has all its vital energy.' Sprouting seeds should be consumed three times a week, she says, because they are 'the freshest things you can eat', with a raised nutritional value. 'Think of all the energy needed for a tiny thing like that to grow to such a height.' </p> <p>Somehow, it sounds right - but it's hardly Professor Baum's kind of science. What I am after is a forensic breakdown of the meal's active ingredients. How does each one fight or prevent cancer - and are any of the alleged benefits scientifically plausible? In its factsheet 'The scientific basis for the Bristol approach to cancer care', the centre offers a few clues. Soya products (such as the Malay-spiced tofu I am eating) are listed along with six other foods and micro-nutrients that are 'known to be actively beneficial in cancer prevention and reduced recurrence': they are cruciferous vegetables (such as broc coli), tomatoes, onions, garlic, omega-3 fish oils and the mineral selenium. </p> <p>However, when I run this list past Liz Butler, the nutritional therapist at the Bristol Cancer Help Centre, she is more circumspect than the promotional literature. 'Tomatoes are a source of lycopene,' she says, 'but lycopene is not a magic bullet like a drug. There has to be a balance of things in the diet; if you look at one antioxidant in isolation, you're just messing about.' It's the range and variety of micro-nutrients that counts, she explains, and the way these compounds work 'synergistically'. In one study conducted for the Institute of Food Research, due to be published shortly, anti-cancer agents were found to be up to 13 times more effective when several foods in a wholefood diet were combined. </p> <p>The best approach, say Bristol nutritionists, is to eat lots of plant foods with known benefits for general health (not just those that may protect against cancer), with an emphasis on 'adding foods to the diet' rather than subtracting them - the opposite principle to most diets. </p> <p>One controversial addition is supplements in capsule form, since most experts say a balanced diet delivers all the vitamins and minerals we need, and the approach has even been linked to an increased risk of cancer. Beta-carotene supplements (which are recommended on the Bristol programme) slightly increased the risks of recurrence in a trial involving people with lung cancer, and another study showed that high vitamin C intake interfered with apoptosis - the natural cell death that stops tumours occurring. 'We recommend supplements because people who are ill, fatigued or busy may not get an ideal diet every day,' Liz Butler explains. 'There is also evidence that minerals in crops are declining due to intensive farming.' </p> <p>Cancer sufferers are also advised to cut down on foods 'associated with an increased risk of cancer'. These include red meat, dairy products, smoked and salt-cured foods, refined sugars, processed foods, caffeine, alcohol and table salt. Game and poultry should be organic; fish should be non-farmed and from deep unpolluted waters, and oily fish should be small varieties such as sardines and pilchards which carry fewer contaminants. Despite such rigours, hundreds of people passing through the Bristol centre say they have benefited from the guidelines while on courses - and 92 per cent continue to follow them at home. </p> <p>So, does the Bristol approach - and Jane Sen's diet - stand up to scientific scrutiny? The only study that has ever looked at the outcome of Bristol patients compared to others (published in the Lancet in September 1990) concluded that women with breast cancer who had attended the centre fared worse - though campaigners and scientists later argued that the study was flawed. When I ask if the centre keeps its own records of recovery and mortality rates, the answer is no. However, yet another supportive clarion call comes from Professor Karol Sikura. Patients on the Bristol programme show fewer side effects during chemotherapy, he says - an idea that comes as no surprise to nutritional therapist Liz Butler. 'The rationale behind everything we do is restoring people's biochemical balance,' she says. 'Then, their immune system is running well and they benefit more from their conventional medical treatment.' </p> <p>In the fight against cancer, then, the message is clear: legitimate science is leading us inexorably towards a vegan diet. Last year, the WHO made its statement about fruit and vegetables. In March, the Food Standards Agency published the results of research it had funded into the link between colorectal cancer and red meat. 'The results support other published studies showing that higher levels of red meat consumption increase the risk,' it concluded. </p> <p>With dairy products, too, there is mounting evidence that avoiding them may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Though cautious about Professor Jane Plant's reasoning in Your Life in Your Hands (in which she attributes her own recovery to abstinence), Professor Tim Key at the Epic project confirms that part of her argument is correct. 'It relates to a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (or IGF-1),' he says, 'and there is some evidence that if you eat more dairy products, blood levels of this hormone go up. There is also some evidence that women with high blood levels of this hormone are more likely to get breast cancer. So that is quite a tantalising story.' </p> <p>Three months ago, the Lancet concluded that there probably was an association between animal products and some forms of cancer and further studies will be published soon, Professor Key reports. 'In fact, we've been working on that here and have shown that vegans have low levels of this hormone - and they don't eat any dairy products.' Yet, in his ruthlessly reductionist way, the principal investigator for Epic-Oxford says the link between dairy products and cancer is 'not an established fact'. In terms of advising the public, he concludes, 'the truth is that we don't know. Some studies have shown the reverse. However, if people want to take a gamble and say, \"I'll give up dairy products because it might turn out to be true\", fair enough.' </p> <p>It doesn't sound like a gamble to me. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Bristol Cancer Help Centre helpline: 0845 123 2310; <a href=\"http://www.bristolcancerhelp.org\">www.bristolcancerhelp.org</a></p>",
  "<p>On 27 October the people of Turkmenistan - a gas-rich, desert-dominated central Asian country - will be celebrating 13 years of independence from the former Soviet Union. There will be feasts and military parades in the gleaming capital, Ashgabat. But, like the Soviet-era buildings behind the marble facades, the fabric of society is crumbling under the rule of the man they will be praising: Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenbashi the Great, Turkmenistan's 'President for Life'.</p> <p>Turkmenistan, which is twice the size of the UK yet has a population of just 5m, has since seceding from the Soviet Union in 1991, 'acquired one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world', according to the European parliament. And central to this system is a cult of personality to match Mao Tse-Tung, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong Il. Turkmenistan's President Niyazov is a man, after all, who has renamed the month of January - after himself.</p> <p>In the last decade, thousands of statues of Niyazov have been erected across the country. The grandest is 12 metres high and coated in gold leaf; it stands on top of a 75-metre tall monument in the centre of Ashgabat and rotates to face the sun. Airports, regions, meteorites, cities and schools have been renamed after the president and his parents. Meetings in his office are televised and broadcast weekly on the three state TV channels.</p> <p>As well as renaming January, Niyazov has renamed April after his mother, May after his father and September after his 'divinely inspired' masterwork, the Rukhnama. This 'book of the soul' dominates the life of his subjects. Written between 1997 and 2001, it fills bookstores across the country and has been made the cornerstone of an otherwise ravaged educational establishment. 'On a par with the Bible and the Koran, it is to be used as a Spiritual Guide,' writes Niyazov in the introduction, 'to remove the complexities and anguishes from day to day living.' There are regular pageants staged in sports stadiums depicting scenes from this opus, centring on the moral purity of his mother and father. And every morning at factories and schools the citizens sing the national anthem, which refers to Turkmenistan as 'The great creation of Turkmenbashi'. </p> <p>'If I was a worker and my president gave me all the things they have here in Turkmenistan, I would not only paint his picture, I would have his picture on my shoulder, or on my clothing,' Niyazov said earlier this year. 'I'm personally against seeing my pictures and statues in the street - but it's what people want.'</p> <p>Saparmurat Atajevich Niyazov was born in the small village of Kipcak on the outskirts of Ashgabat in 1940. His father died in the Second World War, while his mother and brother were among the 100,000 killed in an earthquake that destroyed the capital in 1948. Niyazov grew up in an orphanage and went to study in St Petersburg, before returning to Ashgabat to work as an engineer. He joined the Communist Party in 1962 and rose through the ranks before being chosen by the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to be General Secretary of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan in 1985. It was perceived that his marriage to a Russian wife and his upbringing in an orphanage made him free of any clan-allegiance - an important factor for a clan-based society like Turkmenistan's - and therefore perfect for the job. He was chosen to carry out Moscow's will because of his deference and obedience, and he proceeded to do so without dissent. </p> <p>Perhaps understandably, given his party background, Niyazov was not in favour of Turkmenistan's independence when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate. When it became inevitable, however, he embraced the new ideology as enthusiastically as he had the old, assuming power as president, prime minister and the chairman of the council of ministers, and promoting Turkmen nationalism as his central aim - always with himself at the centre. As the Soviet yoke fell away he assumed the name 'Turkmenbashi' ('father of the Turkmen'). He then set about forging the nation's new identity in his own image. Turkmen opposition figures were either driven into exile or imprisoned. (Most have since been released, but after their experiences in prison, and under constant surveillance since, those still in the country have never dared to speak out.)</p> <p>In 1992, Niyazov 'won' the first presidential elections unopposed, and settled into a Soviet-style dictatorship. His handpicked council of ministers voted him president for life in 1999. In 2001 the Humanitarian Association of the World's Ethnic Turkmens voted to suffix Niyazov's name with Beyt ('great'), much to the president's dismay. 'I am afraid of ever more titles - some even say I am a prophet,' he complained. </p> <p>State-owned newspapers are full of letters from citizens proclaiming their love for Niyazov. But loyalty to the president is not optional. Foreign newspapers are banned, and satellite TV is restricted and censored. The radio station Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty is jammed in most towns. For obvious reasons, news of nearby Georgia's 'Rose Revolution' - the American-engineered overthrow of Eduard Shevardnadze, last November - was not reported at all. </p> <p>Meanwhile, bugging of telephones is assumed to be rife. Members of the intelligence services, police and military are visible on the streets of Ashgabat and other towns. Access to the internet is limited and monitored. Public demonstrations have been suppressed ruthlessly and no longer take place at all. Only two religions are freely practised: Islam and orthodox Christianity. And freedom of movement is nonexistent: Turkmen citizens need permits to enter 'special closed zones' which cover 40 per cent of the country, and travel is restricted between rural areas and the cities. According to the former US Ambassador to Turkmenistan, Laura Kennedy: 'Turkmenbashi controls everything in this country. He personally decides who comes in, who goes out.' Announcing in March that government agencies would intensify their video surveillance of Turkmen citizens - installing cameras on every major street and site in the country - Niyazov said, 'We should know if a fly quietly buzzes past.'</p> <p>The cameras, he claims, are there 'not due to a lack of trust, but to avoid disorder'. And the consequences of 'disorder' are grave. Insulting Niyazov carries a minimum five-year prison sentence. Last year, terrifyingly vague treason laws were passed, carrying life imprisonment for anyone 'attempting to sow doubt among people about the internal and foreign policies conducted by the first and permanent president of Turkmenistan, the Great Saparmurat', or even 'encouraging opposition to the state'. Professor Jerrold Post - who founded the CIA's Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior, and is director of the Political Psychology Program at George Washington University - is building a psychological profile of Niyazov. 'There have only been a few cults of personality to match this; Kim Jong Il and Kim Il-sung in North Korea, and Mao Tse-Tung. The narcissism of the man is really beyond description - he has essentially turned himself into a living god.'</p> <p>Niyazov's grip on Turkmenistan tightened dramatically following the events of 25 November 2002, when shots were fired at the presidential motorcade. Deemed a set-up by some observers, it led to the arrests of hundreds of political opponents, journalists, intellectuals and their family members. A month later at least 59 suspects were jailed after televised show trials reminiscent of the Stalin era, during which defence lawyers actually apologised for representing their clients. These included a drugged and bruised Boris Shikhmuradov, formerly foreign minister, whose confession to masterminding the assassination attempt was clearly read from a script. 'I and my allies... are not opposition members but ordinary criminals and drug addicts... we are all worms... I am a criminal able only to destroy the state.' </p> <p>According to Amnesty International: 'The relatives of those imprisoned after the November 2002 events have still not been allowed to visit the prisoners. Many were tortured and there are indications that some died in prison, but there is no way of finding out the truth.' </p> <p>A ratcheting up of state repression followed across the board, including the sacking, in January 2003, of the chief mufti, Nasrullah ibn Ibadullah, who had led Turkmenistan's Muslims (the country's official religion) for the previous 10 years. Reports variously suggest he was suspected of involvement in the 'assassination' attempt, objected to having phrases from the Rukhnama written on the walls of mosques, or refused to declare publicly that Niyazov is 'God's prophet'. In March, Ibadullah was sentenced to 22 years in prison for reasons that remain unclear. In the same month two of the few independent journalists left in the country, from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, were arrested, beaten, drugged and threatened against broadcasting within the country. An estimated 20,000 dissidents are now in prison. </p> <p>Niyazov writes in the Rukhnama: 'I am attempting to have a logical kind of freedom accepted and approved by this nation. Otherwise freedom will turn into irregularity and destroy the essentials of the state and harm the society.'</p> <p>Murad Turayev and Bayram Medrov (not their real names) are civil activists from the west and east of the country and have gathered and passed on information about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan at great personal risk. Turayev says the alienation felt by the majority of Turkmens is almost total: 'The country has been converted into a hopeless and sinister reservation closed from the outside world. The main part of the population simply doesn't have any interest in what happens. Extreme poverty, unemployment and drug-taking have produced fear and hopelessness.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, Niyazov continues unchecked. Ever more eccentric edicts are carried out by increasingly sycophantic flunkeys and Western companies who are happy to land vast construction contracts. In August, Niyazov broadcast on state TV perhaps his oddest plan yet. 'Let us build a palace of ice so our children can learn to ice skate,' he said, 'big and grand enough for 1,000 people.' With temperatures reaching 50C across much of the nation in summer, many people expected nothing to come of the idea, but Niyazov's favourite construction company, the French firm Bouygues, is scheduled to start on the \u00a313m project next month.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest threat posed by Niyazov's regime is an artificial lake under construction in the Karakum desert, to be known as the Golden Age Lake. At an estimated cost of $6.5bn, it is expected by many scientists to reduce the scarce and vital water supplies of the desert nation through drainage and evaporation. Experts say the best expenditure of funds would be to dredge and re-line the Karakum canal which makes life possible for a large proportion of the Turkmen population. A senior Western official in Ashgabat, who refused to be named, believes Turkmenistan is at a crossroads. 'What it does in the next 50 years will determine what it will be like in the next 10,000 years. It will either be a country that can sustain a population of up to 8or 10 million forever, or it will go back to being a desert with a few watering holes. If it doesn't invest its hydrocarbon profits in the water infrastructure we will be bringing food aid in 50 years' time.</p> <p>'With the right leader,' says the official, 'it has a chance, but Niyazov's only looking at the next 25 years - he just wants people to be quiet while he fulfils his dreams of grandeur.'</p> <p>If one section of the population is the most sympathetic to its president it is the youth of Turkmenistan. According to Medrov: 'A new generation is emerging that knows nothing apart from official propaganda. Before, everyone spoke Russian, could watch TV and know something about what happens in the world, but this new generation only speaks Turkmen, so they are absolutely cut off from all this. Today's state rule is becoming popular among them and this is a new danger.'</p> <p>The brainwashing is intense. Children at nursery learn phrases from the Rukhnama in praise of the great Turkmenbashi before they can read; schoolchildren have to spend two hours a day reading and pondering the lessons it contains. Entrance to university, interviews for jobs in the administration, even driving tests, depend on knowledge of the text. Earlier this year four Russian-speaking officials in the city of Turkmenbashi (formerly Krasnovodsk) were sacked after failing the Rukhnama exam. One high-school maths teacher in Ashgabat misread the question 'What are the names of the mother and father of the president's horse?' and instead named the president's mother and father. As a result, she was denied accreditation. </p> <p>Erika Dailey, director of the Open Society Institute's Turkmenistan Project, says: 'The government encourages children to go home and quiz their parents on the Rukhnama - and to tell their teacher if they are lacking in knowledge.' Meanwhile, parents know their children have no alternative route to success other than winning cash prizes and appearances on TV by singing songs and reciting poems in praise of Niyazov. The education system is already hamstrung by the removal of children aged 10 and over to harvest cotton from September to November, and the shortening of the state education period from 11 to 9 years. Ballet, opera, the circus and the cinema are banned in Turkmenistan - condemned by Niyazov as contrary to national traditions. And a law passed last November required non-governmental organisations to re-register, heralding the closure of groups from ecology clubs to a sports club for disabled teenagers. The scope for development is shrinking all the time.</p> <p>The only head of state the 40 per cent of the population under the age of 14 have ever known is President Niyazov. According to Murad Turayev: 'The new generation of young boys and girls... consider it absolutely normal to read the Rukhnama and give all these oaths to the president. For a quarter of the country's population, the Rukhnama is virtually the only book they will have read.'</p> <p>The anonymous Western official adds: 'Within one or two generations you will find a population of younger people who are totally useless, incapable of living in modern society.'</p> <p>Yet this generation plays an increasingly important role in Niyazov's heavily policed state. Military service is two years and usually starts at 17 years old. Groups of teenagers with Kalashnikovs check the documents of people driving across the country. In order to bolster the failing economy conscripts work as lorry drivers, bakers, train attendants, traffic police and factory workers. On 11 February Niyazov sacked a third of the medical workforce - around 15,000 nurses and healthcare workers - by presidential decree, replacing them with conscripts to save the state money. The Western official says that a priority for the country is 'trained people to run its services and its oil and gas industry. At the moment they have to buy in all their technicians from all over the world. If they don't keep pumping, which pays for the massive subsidy system to the nation, this country will slip into chaos.' </p> <p>Niyazov claimed on independence that Turkmenistan would be the new Kuwait. Bordering the Caspian Sea, the country has vast proven gas reserves - the fifth largest in the world - and plenty of oil. By 2001 this was modified to a promise that within a year every family would have 'a house, a car, and a cow with calf'. This promise was then dropped for the more ambiguous propaganda slogan that 'the 21st century is the golden age of the Turkmens'. </p> <p>Yet gas production is still not back up to the levels of the early Nineties. Plans to build pipelines to Western markets in the Arabian gulf or Mediterranean have foundered, due to regional instability and Niyazov's unpredictability. The state provides free gas and water, cheap housing and bread, and for the men in Ashgabat at least, horse races. But anecdotally - for there are no hard statistics on Turkmenistan - unemployment, underemployment and non-payment of salaries are rife and worsening; state services are disintegrating; life expectancy falling. The free supply of gas and water is at the heart of all of Niyazov's claims to be a generous, successful leader. When he introduced the system 12 years ago it was supposed to remain in place for a decade before people began to pay. The anonymous Western official says, 'If these services were withdrawn there would be chaos, you'd be looking at a revolution.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, despite EU and UN resolutions requesting that the Turkmen authorities co-operate with international human rights organisations, no such co-operation has ensued. Certain laws - the introduction of exit visas, the restriction of religious practice - have been amended, but in practice little has changed; people cannot leave the country freely and they are free only to practise the central religions. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch believes international organisations have some leverage: 'The Turkmen government takes great pride in its UN membership. The UN must make clear that [Turkmenistan's] failure to co-operate is unacceptable.'</p> <p>Aaron Rhodes, executive director of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, says that support from major foreign governments is needed: 'Much more could be done to force peaceful change; if major world leaders with authority would acknowledge that this is a dictatorship, depriving people of rights, this would really have an effect.' </p> <p>But there are other factors to consider. The US Airforce benefits from being able to fly its jets through Turkmen airspace. The vast reserves of gas and oil in Turkmenistan have been the subject of frantic lobbying by Western governments in the past, and the possibility of securing access in the future must act as a brake to any criticisms of Niyazov. In fact, a high-level Russian delegation visiting Niyazov earlier in the year praised his achievements as 'fantastic' and the Rukhnama as 'a serious philosophical work'. They also signed a co-operation agreement designed to encourage joint investment in the fishing industry, mining and, most importantly, gas production. </p> <p>According to Rhodes, 'There's a tremendous tendency to support the status quo. People don't want to rock the boat, they don't need another failed state on their hands. They probably would like to see Turkmenbashi keep power.' </p> <p>Erika Dailey believes the status quo will lead to disaster. 'If the trend continues, and neither economic nor political reform is introduced soon, Turkmenistan will become non-functional, a failed state.'</p> <p>Robert Corzine is one of the few Western journalists to have met Niyazov. In his experience, the president is unlikely to be unduly swayed by outside influence. He recalls an interview in 1999 in which the subject of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea arose: 'Niyazov got a map and said, \"I'll tell you who owns the Caspian,\" and he took out his $1,000 pen, crossed out the word Azeri Oilfield [property of Azerbaijan] and wrote Serdar ['leader' - his name] Oilfield in its place. Stabbing the map he said, \"That's mine, that's mine.\" When I left the meeting, his then foreign minister Boris Shikhmuradov, who was more of a suave character, said, \"You can tone down some of the things the president said.\" But Niyazov, who had overheard, said: \"No, he can write whatever he wants.\" The next day when the story appeared the Azerbaijanis sent gunboats out.'</p> <p>Despite a recent heart bypass operation there are no serious indications that Niyazov has a succession plan: an election mooted for 2008 is expected to disappear like previous dates, and he will almost certainly rule until he dies. According to one Western observer Niyazov won't be worried about succession, either: 'He wants to leave the greatest mosque and all his buildings and monuments, and go down in history as the great salvation of Turkmenistan and the greatest Khan - greater even than Tamburlaine or Ghengis Khan.'</p>",
  "<p>Four hours into my visit to the Frankfurt Book Fair, and it all becomes clear: this year's word, endlessly uttered around the hangar-like exhibition hall that houses the publishers of the English-speaking world, is code . Such has been the success of The Da Vinci Code , Dan Brown's murder thriller-cum-conspiracy-based work of mystical lunacy, that even the most unlikely people are after a slice of the action. It's perhaps not so surprising that at the Penguin stand you can flick through The Rough Guide To The Da Vinci Code , a pocket-sized explanation of the novel's underlying theory that was reportedly knocked off in a fortnight. More mind-boggling, however, is a book to be published by the usually haughty Oxford University Press. The Truth Behind The Da Vinci Code is a dispassionate analysis of the bits of recorded history that pervade Brown's tale, written by a recognised authority on early Christianity.</p> <p>Naturally, the craze also gets rather ludicrous. In the US, an initially unsuccessful novel entitled The Miracle Strain has reportedly been reissued as The Miracle Code . A groanworthy joke duly flits around Frankfurt's nocturnal wine-and-canapes circuit: it may be only a matter of time before someone comes up with a hybrid of Jack Kerouac and Dan Brown, and gives the world On The Code .</p> <p>The Frankfurt Book Fair was first staged in 1949 and now close to 7,000 exhibitors are squeezed into 10 gargantuan halls, accompanied by scores of agents and scouts (the latter are hired to keep publishers abreast of hot books from overseas). The event's substance is the trading of international rights: Estonians bid for DBC Pierre, the Brits express gentle interest in the Norwegian answer to Michel Houellebecq, and Chileans crowd around the Vatican City stand to ask about the Pope's forthcoming memoirs. During the day, it makes for a meld of the Ideal Home Exhibition and a speed dating evening; by nightfall, the ambience is more akin to an expense account freshers week.</p> <p>It is reputed that 300,000 visit, but you quickly get the impression that most of the momentum is provided by a hardcore of about 150. Each night, they stumble into the Frankfurter Hof, the raffish city hotel that hosts a daily slew of drinks parties in its function rooms, before piling into the bar. Here, it is still socially acceptable to smoke cigars, and pretty much de rigueur to get ragingly drunk. Told that all this was a central part of the Frankfurt experience, I sheepishly give it a go: after six glasses of wine, I have half-convinced a French publisher that the time is right for a Gallic-flavoured biography of Pink Floyd, and managed to get myself pencilled in for dinner in London with PJ O'Rourke.</p> <p>During that evening and the following day, I also get a relatively clear idea of the publishing world's prevailing mood. Some countries' book people - Germany and Holland are the most notable examples - are having a rough time of it; in Britain, thanks partly to Richard and Judy, JK Rowling and the book reviewers at Heat magazine, our publishing industry is still doing pretty well. Last year, UK companies issued as many books as their counterparts in the States; even if you remove Harry Potter from the sums, the home market has recently been displaying steady growth. Those who fret about the UK descending into square-eyed illiteracy may be unnecessarily worried: as a sales director from Penguin proudly tells me: 'In Britain, it's fashionable to talk about books.'</p> <p>Or some books, anyway. According to the fair's underlying chatter, freshly nudged into the literary dustbin are a couple of once-thriving genres: the kind of narrative non-fiction exemplified by such titanic successes as Longitude and Fermat's Last Theorem , and all but the most solidly established chick-lit. The former, witheringly sent up by an agent I meet as 'things like The History Of The Potato and The Man Who Invented The Diving Helmet', apparently represents an archetypal case of an exhausted market; as far as the latter is concerned, Jenny Colgan and Jane Green may soon be the only novelists left standing.</p> <p>In their place is a raft of more voguish categories. According to Ed Jaspers, an agent whose company, Conville &amp; Walsh, is selling the yet-unwritten by already-notorious Intimate Adventures Of A London Call Girl (mysteriously credited to Belle Du Jour , and initially and erroneously traced to Toby 'How to Lose Friends' Young), the British are beginning to lose their stereotypical habit of putting most literature about sex in the box reserved for 'mucky books'; as the success of the French memoir The Sexual Life Of Catherine M proves, we may be embracing a slightly more continental sense of sophistication.</p> <p>We also have a fresh appetite for State of the World stuff. Not so much the kind of books hacked out by embedded correspondents as soon as they get home from a war (Iraqsploitation, if you will), nor the kind of polemics that are still doing huge business in the US - but books whose voice is measured, insightful, and frequently aimed at advancing the debate into areas that mainstream politics hasn't yet touched. Among Frankfurt's outsider hits this year - though not to be published in the UK until January 2006 - is When the Rivers Run Dry , a book by a longstanding environmental journalist named Fred Pearce which advances the claim that those who fret about the politics of petrol may be lagging behind: as oil was to the last century, so water will be to this one. Pavan Varma's Being Indian aims to deliver a similar jolt to the idea that modern geopolitics is all a matter of America's dominance of the planet: its startling subtitle is 'Why the 21st century will be India's'.</p> <p>And so the generic shifts mount up. Whereas once we favoured that dread genre Mind, Body And Spirit, we now crave books that deal with the simple matter of health: Dr Gillian McKeith's You Are What You Eat (cleverly, a diet book in partial disguise) has sold 1.2 million copies in the UK alone. In the odd instance, meanwhile, publishing archetypes show signs of being shocked back to life by people whose aim is to kick against them: those travel writing devotees tired of the Bill Bryson school of jumperly amiability will be cheered by the imminent arrival of The Last Cosmonaut , a work of 'anti-tourist' non-fiction. In the words of one report, it is the work of 'a clever, rather nihilistic bloke' - suffering from an irony-tinged fixation with Soviet Communism - 'who travels around Russia and Asia looking for the worst of things'.</p> <p>According to those who have been coming here for years - a large number of whom seem to be perma-smoking, impossibly elegant middle-aged European women, somewhere between Camille Paglia and Anne Bancroft in The Graduate - Frankfurt is not quite as it was. Before the advent of email, when synopses and manuscripts could not be zipped across continents, it teetered close to being a theatre of the absurd. Publishers would frequently be locked in reading rooms - having signed documents agreeing not to take notes - and expected to write cheques on the basis of a 20-minute skim. It doesn't seem to have made for the most level-headed of atmospheres: the daily Frankfurt edition of Bookseller magazine features a quote from a publisher at Bloomsbury, recalling the time she bought the UK rights to Isabel Allende's magic realist classic The House Of The Spirits, 'by mistake, under the impression it was a biography of the widow of Salvador Allende'.</p> <p>Moreover, the overwhelming sense of alcohol-assisted frenzy was manifested in a hysterical quest to hype one or two books into the skies, thereby creating that very modern syndrome known as an Expectations Problem. As recently as 2001, coverage of Frankfurt was scythed down to a surreal supposed battle between Brian Greene's Stephen Hawking-esque The Fabric Of The Cosmos and Victoria Beckham's autobiography.</p> <p>These days, meetings at Frankfurt are often the convivial final act of negotiations that have been slowly advancing for weeks and months, and everyone seems annoyingly reluctant to use the crass language of hot books and big deals. 'In the old days, there'd be a consensus within 24 hours,' says Ros Ramsay, a renowned London-based scout whose Frankfurt operation involves wine, beer, crisps and a work surface the size of a school desk. 'Everybody would be running around shouting, \"What's the book? What's the book?\", and of course they'd pretty frequently get it wrong. Now, it's changed. It's much more relaxed.'</p> <p>She may be right, but a sense of curiosity leads me to hobble around the fair on my second day in search of at least one book suitable for an old-school Frankfurt hype job. Thanks to enthusiastic tips from a Dutchman, a Spaniard and a friend at Penguin, I make my way to the stand showcasing the books published by a French company called Denoel, to find out more about a novel entitled A French Suite .</p> <p>It lies so outside the usual parameters of fashionable fiction as to come off looking like that most thrilling phenomenon: a truly unexpected hit. It's the work of Irene N\u00e9mirovsky, a Jewish Russian refugee who settled in Paris in the wake of the communist revolution and became a successful author and playwright, but died in Auschwitz at the age of 39. The manuscript was belatedly restored by her eldest daughter, and published six decades late. Built around a collection of strangers thrown together by the German invasion of France, it has led the country's critics to explode with rapture. In Frankfurt, its success is captured in an altogether more straightforward vernacular: money, deals, and lots of meetings.</p> <p>If The French Suite suggests that nothing works better than literary Sturm und Drang , plenty of Frankfurt's habitues are happy to enthuse about slightly more ephemeral projects. In addition to the aforementioned vogue for books about war, pestilence and not eating crisps, for example, there is an alleged boom in writing about the iPod. At the Frankfurter Hof, I run into the London-based American agent Ed Victor. He's keen to tell me about one of his books: a Nick Hornby-esque volume by Dylan Jones, the editor of GQ , entitled iPod Therefore I Am .</p> <p>Around the room, a few British publishers reckon that celebrations of the iPod may soon make up a surging sub-genre. I think it might be the booze talking: next year, they may be pushing a more dismissive take on the pleasures of listening to songs in random order. In fact, I've got the title already: As iPod Lay Dying.</p> <p><strong>Five Frankfurt hits</strong></p> <p><strong>The genuine sensation</strong></p> <p>Sabine Dardenne, one of Belgian paedophile Marc Dutroux's victims, has written a memoir provisionally titled I Have Chosen To Live.</p> <p><strong>The posthumous damp squib</strong></p> <p>Fan Tan, cracked up to be Marlon Brando's lost novel, is actually a co-write, which remained incomplete because Brando 'lost interest'.

  "<p><strong>The Spotted Pig, 314 West 11th Street, New York (00 1 212 620 0393). Meal for two, including wine and service, \u00a380</strong></p> <p>How to create a modern, urban gastro-pub. Step one: first take your scuzzy pub; your broken down, sticky carpeted, fag-burnt old boozer which last saw better days around the same time as George Best's liver. Because, however negotiable the gastro element may be, the pub bit isn't. If it ain't in a pub then it isn't a gastro-pub. Logical? I think so or, at least, I thought so. It is why, up to now, gastro-pubs have been a purely British phenomenon. Oh sure, lots of other countries have places they refer to as pubs, but none of them actually are, particularly those in America. See the word pub on the outside of a building in the US and what you'll be looking at is the worst kind of plasticated fakery this side of Jordan's breasts.</p> <p>Which was why I was deeply suspicious of the Spotted Pig, a recently opened 'British gastro-pub' in the heart of Greenwich Village. You couldn't get a good pint in that city if Paris Hilton's life depended upon it and, true to form, the site the venture operates from was not previously a pub at all, but a French restaurant called Le Zoo, which has been given a hefty make-over. It's a tight, low-ceilinged corner of a place, made tighter still by the crowds of see-and-be-seen people who crowd in here undaunted by the waits for unbookable tables that easily crest the hour within a few minutes of opening. </p> <p>No matter: there is a heavy dark-wood bar to be crushed against and lots of porcine illustrations on the wall to look at, and the warming sense that this is the place to be in New York right now. It is part-owned by the superstar American-Italian chef Mario Batali, who has more fists in more restaurant pies than almost anybody else in town right now, which partly accounts for that must-have stamp. But is it a gastro-pub? The chef, April Bloomfield, does at least have British credentials, having worked at Bibendum, Kensington Place and, most importantly, the River Cafe in London, the influence of which shows most on the menu. It has a distinct southern Mediterranean feel. The cheese in a starter of buffalo mozzarella with bruschetta of stewed peppers, for example, was not the ice-hockey puck of white rubber we get too often here, but the milky, textured, grass-sweet creature it should be. A salad of green beans and rocket with a mustard dressing and a perfectly executed soft-boiled duck's egg, was an equally unshowy and satisfying piece of assemblage.</p> <p>The same simple virtues were present in my companion's main course of chargrilled monkfish. It was a fresh slab of fish, sensitively cooked and served with a mixture of roast aubergine and cherry tomatoes which were, as they say about those parts, 'deeply simpatico'. It was when I got to my thick chargrilled burger, served on a crisp bun with a slab of Roquefort on top and a side of shoestring potatoes, mixed with shards of crisp, fried garlic and rosemary, that it occurred to me: I had to stop sneering. It didn't matter what the building had once been. This menu, with its confident eclecticism, its generous devil-may-care approach to plating and delivery, was exactly what you would expect to find in a British gastro-pub.</p> <p>Of course, there are some food pubs here which have a distinct character. The original gastro-pub, the Eagle in Farringdon, still cleaves very closely to its Iberian roots. The more recent Anchor &amp; Hope near Waterloo has a big-fisted liver and lights feel about it, broadly reminiscent of St John. </p> <p>But as for the rest of them, they are (mostly) what the Spotted Pig is: an exercise in casual dining which strips away the self-conscious flummery and artifice that attends so many big restaurant experiences. They give you a list of food. They cook it for you and bring it to your table. You pay and go home fed. Hell, the experience was so authentically British gastro-pub that our waiter was an Australian, as they almost always are here. And naturally, this being a gastro-pub, we didn't feel the need to drink beer (though, for the record they had Beamish Stout and their own Spotted Pig, brewed for them in Brooklyn). They had a great list of inexpensive wines, from which we drank a hefty (and cheap) Californian Sauvignon with some funky name like Rabbit Jump or Running Rabbit or Pissed Bunny. Pricing was also spot on: around \u00a37 for a starter and \u00a310 to \u00a312 for a main course. My, but the exchange rate is so in our favour right now. </p> <p>In Britain, where two of anything is a trend, three is a craze and four a frightful bore, there is a tendency to decry the gastro-pub as a fashion that has had its day; a movement that has, in its own way, become as formulaic and tawdry as what went before. This is cobblers. The latest adventures in molecular gastronomy may be intriguing to a culinary trainspotter like me. The critics may swoon or swear over the latest offerings from Gordon Ramsay or Tom Aikens, the \u00a3100-a-head dinners with their parades of courses and freebies from the chef which are nothing of the sort, but the real battle for the culinary heart of Britain is being fought in places like the gastro-pubs, which make the eating of good, affordable food outside the home a habit rather than a treat. The weird thing about this is that it took me a trip to New York and the Spotted Pig to realise it.</p>",
  "<p>The peasants say that if you whisper Ernesto 'Che' Guevara's name to the sky or light a candle to his memory, you will find your lost goat or cow. 'If you really have faith, he never fails,' Juan Pablo Escobar says. </p> <p>The people in this village pray to a man who once limped down their dusty, unpaved streets, who was killed in their schoolhouse. </p> <p>Guevara died in this isolated hamlet 37 years ago, his band of two dozen warriors captured by the Bolivian army, having failed to launch a continent-wide revolution. </p> <p>Now locals hope the legend of 'El Che' can help to rescue their drought-stricken village. La Higuera is the last and best-known stop on the 'Che Trail', a plan to cash in on Guevara's enduring fame by attracting tourists to the landmarks of his quixotic final campaign. Britain's Department for International Development provided part of the funding. </p> <p>'We have big hopes,' said Roberto Aramayo Cruz, a leader of the Guaran\u00ed Indian community in Lagunillas, near the farm where Guevara established his first guerrilla base camp, about 80 miles south of La Higuera. 'We get a few tourists now. But when the route is well prepared, more will come.' </p> <p>Guevara died in October 1967 and became a revolutionary icon. The photograph of him with a beret and flowing hair - taken in 1960 by Alberto Korda at a Havana funeral - went up on countless walls, T-shirts and badges. </p> <p>He was seen as a warrior with the heart of a poet. Young radicals pored over his writings. </p> <p>A new movie, The Motorcycle Diaries, introduces a gentler Guevara - the bohemian Argentinian who set off from Buenos Aires in 1952 on a coming-of-age motorcycle journey. The story ends three years before the turning point in Guevara's adventures: meeting an exiled Cuban revolutionary named Fidel Castro in Mexico. Guevara went on to become a leader of Cuba's communist government, but left the country in 1965 to launch new revolutions. After failure in Congo, he arrived in Bolivia, where the government vowed to crush his Marxist movement. This week, however, the Bolivian Minister of Tourism will come here to mark the opening of the Che Trail. </p> <p>'For a long time, people did not want to accept the idea that our town was identified with Che's name,' said Carlos Sosa, director of the House of Culture in Vallegrande, where Guevara was secretly buried after his death. 'His name frightened some people. But now we see the benefits.' </p> <p>Hoping The Motorcycle Diaries will bring more than the current trickle of tourists to Vallegrande, Lagunillas, La Higuera and other towns in central Bolivia, the international humanitarian group Care has helped to co-ordinate a $600,000 infrastructure programme. </p> <p>'Tourism is fundamental to the economic development of this area,' said Jaqueline Pe\u00f1a y Lillo, a Care director. 'These are towns where even a small amount of tourists will make a big difference in the quality of life.' She said Bolivia's 4th Army Division, one of the units that defeated Guevara's rebels, was providing logistical support. </p> <p>Next year Care will sponsor a Che eco-challenge, Pe\u00f1a y Lillo said. Participants will follow the trail through the jungle and scrubland that Guevara and his guerrillas traversed, fording rivers and scaling mountains. The terrain exhausted Guevara and his troops and the locals lent him little support. In his Bolivian Diary, Guevara laments not recruiting a single peasant. Some thought Guevara and his men - with their unkempt beards and tattered clothes - were wizards. </p> <p>Eventually, about 1,800 Bolivian soldiers surrounded Guevara's militia - which never numbered more than 50 men and one woman - in a canyon near La Higuera. After a brief firefight, he was captured. </p> <p>Manuel C\u00f3rtez, then 20, remembers seeing the captive limp into La Higuera. Wounded in the leg, he walked with the help of two men, including a soldier, and was taken to the schoolhouse. </p> <p>C\u00f3rtez still lives near that building, which has since been converted into a museum. The day after Guevara's capture, C\u00f3rtez was standing behind the fence of his property, he said, and overheard a conversation between two soldiers. </p> <p>'They walked past my house and tossed two beer bottles in front of the fence,' C\u00f3rtez said. 'One soldier said, \"Should I kill him or you?\" \"Either way,\" the other said.' </p> <p>Five minutes later C\u00f3rtez heard gunfire from the schoolhouse - two bursts, a minute or so apart. Some time later, he heard the soldiers joking and celebrating. </p> <p>'They laughed as they embraced each other. \"Now we get to go back to the city. No more marching through the mountains!\"' </p> <p>Julia C\u00f3rtez, the last civilian to talk to Guevara before he was killed, was the village teacher. She will speak to tourists and also to journalists for a fee. She recently charged a German TV crew $200. </p> <p>Escobar, one of two official tour guides in the town, is happy if tourists give him a small tip. Guevara came to Bolivia, after all, to help the poor. 'It has not rained here for more than a year,' said Escobar. 'Our crops this year were less than half what they were the year before.' </p> <p>The drought is the latest in a series of calamities to befall the 150 or so residents of La Higuera, forcing many families to leave. Just a few more tourist dollars may be enough to encourage people to stay. </p> <p>La Higuera may seem poor and sad, but history was made here. On the schoolhouse's floor an 'X' is scratched. 'This marks the spot where El Che was sitting when they killed him,' Escobar said. </p> <p>On most days, just one or two pilgrims come - the village is a three-hour drive on unpaved roads from the nearest city, Vallegrande. </p> <p>Norberto Forgione, a Buenos Aires psychologist and activist, regularly brings groups of students on 'Che tours', but worries that the area may become a kind of 'guerrilla Disneyland'. </p> <p>'We run the risk of emptying Che's presence on Earth of its historical context,' he said. 'It's good that they improve the roads and the hotels so that more people can go. But they have to preserve and respect the history.' </p> <p>Visitors such as Forgione believe that, when they are walking in La Higuera and other places on the Che Trail, they are walking on hallowed ground. </p> <p>That veneration is perhaps strongest at another stop, the hospital laundry in Vallegrande, where Guevara's body was placed on public display on a concrete washbasin. For the Bolivian soldiers who posed with the corpse, it was proof of their victory. </p> <p>But the image of Guevara in death - half-naked, with flowing hair and eyes eerily open in a Christ-like gaze - deepened the mystique. Over the years, countless pilgrims have come to the laundry to scratch messages, some with a near-religious adoration: 'Che: May your glory illuminate us!' 'Che, immortal commander. Ever onward to victory!' </p> <p>But some tourists might agree with the Rough Guide 's assessment: 'Unless you share their veneration of the revolutionary icon, there's little reason to come here.' </p> <p>\u00a9 2004 Los Angeles Times</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tynan</strong><br>RSC Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon</p> <p>Kenneth Tynan's theatre criticism was a performance. There was a dazzle to his reviews as though he were standing in the footlights himself, almost competing with the work he described, aware of the likelihood that the best lines would turn out to be his own. His diaries are different. He is his own audience and although he entertains himself whenever possible, he is off duty and stylistically off the boil. He left the diaries to his daughter Tracy - it took her decades to nerve herself to read them. But it was she who persuaded Richard Nelson to turn them into a play (part of the RSC's New Work Festival). The diaries record Tynan's sadomasochistic affair with Nicole, 'a spanking addict'. (He unrealistically attempted to calm his wife, Kathleen, by saying Nicole was his 'curry', she his 'French cooking'). But the diaries are more morbid than erotic. He reflects on suicide, the death of friends, his health (dreadful - he was dying of emphysema) and his penis. One entry includes the line: 'We go to plays to learn about others.' And his diaries are best when describing others, too. I particularly relished his oddball anecdotes about actors. Sir Ralph Richardson told Tynan he had visions of the place he came from before birth, saying it looked rather like Mexico. And Sir John Gielgud confessed to a childhood habit of eating rubber. </p> <p>Corin Redgrave, in grey suit, psychedelic shirt and horribly lively striped socks, is compelling in the part. He holds the attention absolutely for an hour-and- a-half. And Richard Nelson directs his well-grafted piece with aplomb. But for anyone wandering in knowing nothing of Tynan, this is a poor show. Not a celebration of a flamboyant talent, just a portrait of the critic as a sad, sick, stuck, middle-aged man.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Elvis Costello and the Imposters</strong><br>Glasgow Barrowland</p> <p>Elvis Costello and the Imposters arrived with a new release, The Delivery Man. But Elvis began his set by easing towards it, lifting the audience through six older songs before he hit the album's title track and brought the music of the American South back to its roots in Scotland. </p> <p>This gentle ascent allowed us to take a measure of the Imposters. Tom Waits once called Pete Thomas 'one of the best rock drummers alive' and you can see why, although, with his new haircut he looks disconcertingly like Alastair Campbell. Steve Nieve wore a kilt and was as watchable as Costello himself, approaching his instruments with the hand gestures of the Karate Kid as he amused himself with his modulating Moog theremin, which (I hope I'm right in saying) makes all the 'wheeeeazzziiiinnnn' noises on 'Country Darkness'. </p> <p>So we were led through the suburbs of Costello's punk youth and out into the country by way of 'Radio Radio' and the oft-shouted-for 'Psycho'. Then a roadie brought on a fabulous guitar, perhaps a Gretsch Country Gentleman, and the new material rolled out like Hank Williams's truck. </p> <p>Glasgow's a knowledgeable town to play country in - it exported all that yearning - but Costello had already tested his material in a small bar in Oxford, Mississippi. The lonely, hardscrabble sentimentality rose like mist off the Delta. 'In a certain light he looked like Elvis/ in a certain way he seemed like Jesus'. </p> <p>By the time we reached 'Either Side of the Same Town', which was the point where other bands might have been thinking of their green room, Costello's case that he can take his music in any direction he fancies had been argued. This song, also from the new album, would keep patrons of a truck stop in New Mexico happy. Next to me, a fat man with a beard began to sing along and several others raised their plastic pints in salute. </p> <p>It's a pity about Costello's audience. It's great we're all so loyal, but disappointing that we are so homogeneous. There we swayed; middle-aged blokes whose Grant Mitchell haircuts were leavened by (quite) fashionable glasses. It's the downside of Costello's constantly inquisitive career that although he is seen as cool by almost everybody, his audience consists only of those prepared to take the journey with him. There were still tickets available and almost nobody was in their twenties. </p> <p>What hasn't changed is Costello's voice. It may not be as close to cracking as it once was, but when he played 'High Fidelity', from 1980's Get Happy , it was like being drawn back into a world where the Jam were king. Yet this is skill, not sentimentalism. </p> <p>When the band decide to rock, they can make the Barrowland's famously sprung dancefloor trampoline. 'The crowd moves like the sea,' said Travis's Neil Primrose of performing there. 'It feels like being in a trawler off Aberdeen.' On Wednesday 'I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down' summoned such a storm. </p> <p>Costello's journey will eventually give him the immortality he seeks, but it is something else that makes him the live performer he is (and which made last week's show so memorable). He must love performing. Costello played 27 songs, brought the house down with 'Shipbuilding' and then, after a second encore, went out with 'Oliver's Army', '(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding' and, finally, 'Pump It Up'. He'd have to love performing in order to play those songs after 25 years and still make them fresh.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists are developing techniques aimed at taming the power of the world's most devastating storms. The project, backed by funds from Nasa, would involve seeding clouds, coating seas with biodegradable 'slicks' and even beaming microwave radiation from orbiting power stations to slow or even halt hurricanes. </p> <p>Controlling these great, rolling tempests - known as hurricanes in the Atlantic, typhoons in the western Pacific and cyclones in the eastern Pacific - is now considered an urgent priority. Last month Hurricane Ivan killed more than 70 people and destroyed thousands of homes, miles of roads, swaths of vegetation and scores of hotels as it swept over Grenada, Jamaica, Tobago, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and finally Cuba. Three similar recent storms caused the same kind of devastation, and meteorologists predict the next two decades will see increases in numbers and severity of hurricanes. Global warming is likely to worsen the problem. </p> <p>'Nothing stands in the way of hurricanes,' says Ross Hoffman, in the current issue of Scientific American. 'But must these fearful forces be forever beyond our control?' The answer is 'no', he adds, for one day they could be controlled thanks to developments in computing, satellite technology and material sciences. </p> <p>Backed by Nasa funds, his team of scientists at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a research and development consulting firm, have created computer simulations of past hurricanes, including Hurricane Iniki which caused enormous damage to the Hawaiian island Kauai in 1992, and Hurricane Andrew, which devastated south Florida in the same year. To their surprise they found that by making only relatively small changes to temperatures and other meteorological variables they could induce major alterations in its path and behaviour. Slight tinkering sent Iniki on a route that missed Kauai, for example. 'The question is: how can such perturbations be achieved?' asks Hoffman. </p> <p>The team has proposed several answers. One is to coat the ocean in front of a hurricane with a biodegradable oil which would slow the evaporation of water from the sea surface, depriving the developing storm of its sustenance. Another technique is to seed the eyes of hurricanes with silver iodide crystals, speeding formation of ice from water vapour. Spread by aircraft, these seed clouds could cause hurricanes to dissipate, although the group acknowledges that early tests have been only partially successful. </p> <p>The ultimate technique would be the construction of a flotilla of orbiting power stations that would collect the Sun's rays and beam them to Earth as microwave radiation. These satellites are considered a promising, non-polluting energy source for the future, but could also be used to heat the sea and air around hurricanes, altering their paths and dissipating their energy.</p>",
  "<p>There was a fleeting moment, a few months ago, when David Barclay said - or seemed to say - that his Telegraph might no longer support the Tories, that open-mindedness might be the order of his new day. Well, you can forget that.</p> <p>'Michael Howard played a blinder by the sea,' gushed a Telegraph leader as the Calm Man took a bow. 'The electorate is in a conservative mood again... Conservatism is coming back into vogue and now it is up to the Conservatives to harry Labour from office.'</p> <p>As triumphs of hope over Hartlepool experience (or opinion polls showing that only 12 per cent of voters believe Howard will ever be PM) go, that was pretty ripe. But at least the Barclaygraph will stick to its Blackagraph course (and pension-drawing readership profile): old Tories still stump up 60p for it every morning. Neither they nor the Barclays have anywhere else to go. </p> <p>Thus the suddenly more significant questions after an overdose of Bournemouth and Brighton ozone passed Telegraph Towers by - but knocked on almost every other Fleet Street door. Who are we backing next May? And who do we love most, Tony or Gordon? </p> <p>Some of the answers aren't too difficult to guess. The Express, which used to love Blair and eat biscuits at his tea table, has turned into an attack dog biscuit (perhaps because its readers are just as old and just as Tory as the Telegraph). It will carry on a hyena howl of hate far beyond next spring, banging on about immigration and never stopping to wonder why the Daily Star (which majors in boobs not political bile) keeps gaining circulation.</p> <p>Equally, the Mirror - after its latest editor's rather perfunctory affirmation of regained faith in Labour - must now sit tight and deal with its own Paul Routledge's admiration for Brown once the polls closed. The Mail? It 'can never regain' whatever trust it once reposed in the Prime Minister, but it worries whether 'boring but competent' policies are enough to turf him out. Much yack about 'shadows' of doubt, distrust and disillusion; many hand-wringing editorials. But the Mail doesn't like backing losers. Its 'clear and consistent' policy will probably consist of playing Samson on the temple steps.</p> <p>No, the big ones in this equation are owned by Rupert Murdoch. And the interesting ones on Gordon and Tony and Charlie are the Guardian and Independent. Will the Sun win it for the Tories? No way. They're 'sick and tired', according to Dr Trevor Kavanagh. Even when Howard puts on a decent show - 'like a lawyer setting out facts to a client', according to Kavanagh QC - 'the polls are against him and his party being elected'. It's a 'weak team'. </p> <p>This is the Murdoch equivalent of don't-call-me-I'll-call-you. And if you want more grey reasons, turn from the Bun to the tartlet Times, as it grinds on about 'lightweight Shadow Cabinet' members, MPs with 'odd views' and 'high Tories who have a contempt for contemporary America'. What, heresy? Rupe doesn't beat about the Bush these days. You're either for me or down the pan, Mikey.</p> <p>News International, in short, is along for the full Blair ride (with psychiatrist Kavanagh explaining to Gordon how he's misunderstood Tony). That won't change until Labour look like losers, friends of Murdoch no longer worth cultivating. Don't hold your breath. </p> <p>And over there, at the end of the liberal rainbow? The Independent, still fuming over Iraq, is definitely in play, yet coy about too much commitment (at least until Sir Anthony O'Reilly has finished wooing advertising agencies).</p> <p>But the Guardian almost seems to be making up its mind in public. It backed the Lib Dems in Hartlepool as some kind of virility test. Several of its most influential commentators are bailing out on Blairism, firing weapons of mass disillusionment. You can see a Brown surge building. But what if, as so often before, Gordon goes quiet and team-playing again for the parliamentary duration? How do you back a non-candidate? These, for the moment, are the politics of Hobson's choice. Good chap, Hobson. Why isn't he standing?</p> <p><strong>A ripe porky pie and a big cheese that's gone off</strong></p> <p>It was, by any standards, a rattling good political yarn. A cabinet minister, discovered in the canteen eating mutton pie and beans when he should have been answering questions in the House, got the boot. (He said he was detained on 'important business', which is an unusual kind of mutton and porky pie). </p> <p>Another big cheese of a health minister, having made a rare hash of hospital closures, slipped several notches down the greasy poll. Finance supremos came and went. A beleaguered leader talked desperately about 'the right team for the right time'.</p> <p>Humph! said the Daily Telegraph. This isn't a government of all the talents, this a government of nil talent in which politicians 'no one has heard of get reshuffled to galvanise an administration no one likes'. At least, that was what my early edition of the Telegraph said - across a dedicated page of detailed and juicy coverage. Ripe stuff, even on Michael Howard's big day. Action, no words. Accountability plus mutability.</p> <p>But then something went bump in the night. By the Telegraph's London edition dropped on my mat there wasn't a word about this Scottish cabinet upheaval in Edinburgh. Nor could I find a mention of it in the Independent, Guardian or Times. Just 309 words in the FT was the sum total of metropolitan interest - another glum helping of devolution pie and has-beens.</p> <p>The devolved idea, you may remember, was to make Scotland more democratic, more powerful, more interesting, as it spent its own (and England's) money.</p> <p>National papers poured in extra reporters and pages. But then - equally predictably - the bottom fell out of this particular bucket. Scotland, it appeared, was only interesting to Scots. When in doubt, take it out after first edition. North of the border had become somehow foreign and irrelevant, a faraway land of which we wished to know little. Islington yawned and moved on.</p> <p>So they spend our money, dominate our Parliament, nominate Big Gordo to rule Downing Street - and we wipe any mention of them from the face of our earth. Maybe if they'd banned google-wearing kids in kilts from playing conkers we'd have kept them until the Islington slip. McDumb, McDumber, McDumbest.</p> <p><strong>Why should Wally carry the can?</strong></p> <p>Wally Cowley, circulation chief at Mirror Group Newspapers, was one of the most amiable titans of the news trade, a loyal toiler through 16 tough years. Until last week, that is, when Cowley got canned. Thank you (said his recently upgraded boss, Ellis Watson) and goodnight. </p> <p>On the face of it, perhaps, you can see why. Take last July's figures, the month Watson got his feet under his new desk, and compare them with July 1988, the year of Wally's first coming. Then, the Mirror sold 3,157,269 copies a day. Now it's 1,816,908. Then, the Sunday Mirror sold 2,965,863; make that 1,569,781 now. Then, the People stood at 2,552,092; today the sum total of People people is 1,022,243.</p> <p>No wonder Cowley's out, you may think; the only real surprise is that he didn't go earlier. But that is both unfair and a huge misunderstanding. Circulation directors don't increase or decrease circulation much. Their job is getting the copies spread around and the offers organised. It's editors, and senior managers like Watson and Sly Bailey, who are paid to carry the ultimate can. Alas, poor Wal... I hope his tin came stuffed with pennies.</p> <p><strong>Ban on Bambi?</strong></p> <p>The BBC and Ofcom are at loggerheads again over an Ofcom code which, the Beeb says, could breach the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child and stop it showing Bambi (though the causal link there remains a tad obscure). But not only that... Ofcom wants to make sure 'that factual programmes must respect the truth'. Call it Gilligan's Law and ask the inevitable question: Will these power-crazed bureaucrats stop at nothing?</p>"
