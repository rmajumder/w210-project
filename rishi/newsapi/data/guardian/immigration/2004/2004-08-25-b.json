  "Britain's statisticians yesterday rejected accusations that they were manipulating official figures on asylum, immigration and population, and accused critics of doing \"unjustified damage\" to the UK's international reputation. <p>Evidently stung by weekend allegations made by Sir Andrew Green, the former British ambassador who now heads the MigrationWatch campaign, Len Cook, head of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) wrote to Sir Andrew and pleaded for a responsible debate on population trends. </p> <p>Sir Andrew has been a trenchant critic of Labour immigration policies, accusing ministers of spin. But Mr Cook accused him of helping to create media reports which muddled different figures. </p> <p>\"Central to these reports is an assertion that ONS delayed the publication of immigration figures. In fact the figure quoted for net immigration to the UK of 172,000 was published on 12 June 2003, some three months earlier than the exchanges of correspondence mentioned in the reports,\" Mr Cook wrote. </p> <p>\"As a national statistician, I do not consult ministers about methodological choices,\" he said, denying charges in detail and advising Sir Andrew to exercise a \"duty of care\" in attacking civil servants.</p>",
  "<p>The opinion poll on asylum you refer to (Leaders, August 25) is probably one carried out not last year, but the previous year, a Mori poll commissioned by us and other organisations for Refugee Week in June 2002. This showed that the British public overestimated by 10 times the number of the world's refugees and asylum-seekers hosted by the UK. </p> <p>In the last two years politicians have mostly spoken about \"getting numbers down\" on asylum. The upshot is that public debate on the UK's role in providing a safe haven to some of the world's most vulnerable people is running largely on a diet of misinformation and political rhetoric. A dangerous diet for everyone, not least for asylum seekers themselves. <br> <strong>Kate Allen </strong><br> Amnesty International UK  The Home Office did not influence the timing of publication of migration figures by the Office for National Statistics (Report, August 23). The Home Office was one of a number of users of population statistics who were properly consulted by ONS about their requirements from population projections. This had little to do with migration figures. These were not \"delayed\" and had already been published in June - three months before the alleged interference. </p> <p>ONS faced a choice of publishing population projec tions (a forward look at the UK population) on schedule, or delaying until 2004, by which time population estimates (of current population) would have been updated. Contrary to reports of interference, ONS chose to publish the projections as scheduled on December 18 2003. Your story confuses this with a one-week delay in the separate mid-year population estimates in September 2003, which was caused by detection of a small error in the allocation of armed forces personnel. </p> <p>ONS follows a strict code of conduct in publishing statistics and is not subject to interference by anybody.<br> <strong>John Pullinger</strong><br> Executive director, ONS</p>",
  "<p>If, as the <strong>Independent</strong> yesterday claimed, the \"primary aim\" of the government's immigration policy was \"appeasing the rightwing press\", the home secretary must have been disappointed with the coverage of his announcement that asylum applications had fallen 13% between April and June. </p> <p>\"So what?\" snarled the <strong>Daily Star</strong>. \"This is less of a decrease than other EU countries are enjoying.\" The <strong>Daily Mail</strong> was similarly unimpressed. \"True, asylum numbers are down,\" it said. \"Is that surprising, when there has been a staggering 54% increase in migrants allowed to stay here permanently, and work permits are scattered like confetti? New Labour has made it so easy to come here that fewer and fewer bother to claim asylum.\" </p> <p>The Mail had a lot of time for David Blunkett himself - \"no home secretary could have worked harder than Mr Blunkett to restore sanity to Britain's immigration and asylum system\" - but his \"misfortune\" was to belong to \"a government so mired in mendacity that nobody believes a word it says\". </p> <p>The <strong>Times</strong> welcomed the drop in applications, but pointed out that the removal rate for failed asylum seekers had also fallen. \"No asylum policy is credible if those refused remain in the country,\" the paper said. \"And no policy is fair if deportations are so tardy that families and their children are wrenched after years from homes, schools and communities.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the London <strong>Evening Standard</strong> took issue with the fact that \"139,675 people were granted the right to settle in Britain in 2003, a 20% rise on the previous year. We support what Tony Blair calls 'controlled immigration' - if it is controlled. But as long as the asylum system is abused by economic migrants, and as long as doubt remains about the government's statistics on illegal immigration, controlled immigration will seem like a contradiction in terms.\" </p> <p>The <strong>Daily Express</strong> compared the government's figures with recent comments by the EU's new justice and home affairs commissioner, Rocco Buttiglione, who described the issue of economic migration as a \"time bomb\". \"Whose figures can we trust?\" the paper asked. \"Britain is still the top asylum destination and we must work with our European partners to avert a potential disaster.\"</p>",
  "In the Midlands, a row over health services alerts us to a truly eye-catching Department of Health initiative. Pressed by the Birmingham Evening Mail, the Birmingham and Black Country health authority admits it took advantage of a heavily pushed DoH scheme which promised it 50p back for every \u00a31 of its annual budget it didn't spend. Whatever pennypinching got it there, the authority kept back \u00a33m, and expects its extra \u00a31.5m soon. One of those ideas that works best in theory, perhaps, when concerns over hospitals have rarely been higher. Health watchdogs claim the \u00a33m was enough to hire 150 cleaners or auxiliary nurses, take on 50 extra GPs, or fund more than 1,000 heart bypass operations. Such an alluring scheme, we tell Charlotte in the DoH press office. And yet, we're trying to find the right name for it. It's not really a reward card, given you're encouraging hospitals to withhold funds and effectively penalising them for not doing so. It's more of a quasi-sanctions policy against sick people, isn't it? \"Er ... I see your point,\" says Charlotte. \"I'll try and find out the rationale.\" Do. And while you're at it, you might ask Dr Reid if he'll ever tire of aping Nye Bevan quite so heavyhandedly. <p><b>\u00b7</b> From the minutes of last month's Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators meeting: \"Dog Accident. The owner of the dog accidentally killed on the commons by a keeper has been reimbursed the cost of cremation and of a replacement dog. No acknowledgement has yet been received from the owner.\" Honestly, the manners of some people. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Although we are beyond distraught to learn Mark Thatcher was arrested in his pyjamas, this fascinating Equatorial Guinea business makes us desperate for a natter with an old friend. \"I knew it would be you,\" laughs Freddie Forsyth when we call him at his Hertfordshire farm. Unfortunately we commit a bit of a faux pas when we tell him the whole extraordinary tale sounds like a Joseph Conrad novel. \"It's more like my book The Dogs of War,\" says Freddie, \"which could actually have been used as a manual.\" We're mortified - but we've always thought you're miles better than Joseph Conrad anyway. \"Thank you,\" he says. \"Interestingly, the Sunday Times Insight team accused me of plotting a coup in Equatorial Guinea in 1978.\" Blimey - is there anyone who hasn't had a crack, old boy? \"Many have tried,\" says Freddie. \"But I don't think you'll find Mark Thatcher is the Mr Big here.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Either way, whoever the JH Archer is who donated $135,000 to the coup kitty - and it's not Jeffrey, he swears it - must be feeling very relaxed today. After all, Mark doesn't look like the sort of chap who'd sing like a canary under firm questioning, does he?</p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Diary readers who have holiday time left this year are strongly advised to consider an unconventional destination. It's a little off the beaten track, but an article in the current edition of Merton council's magazine suggests that for sheer historical scope one corner of the world is unsurpassed. \"Morden has seen everything,\" it declares, \"from mammoths in the Ice Age, to being a region of forest, swamp and heath with bears, boars, wolves and wild cats to quick development following the opening of the Morden Underground station in the swinging 1920s.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Our awestruck commiserations, finally, to Aylar Dianati Lie, recently booted out of the Miss Norway finals. It's not that we're especially impressed with her portfolio of pornographic work which came dramatically to light during the contest.

  "Complaints about poor lane discipline strike a chord with me. People who dawdle in the fast lane, barely move in the medium lane or go in completely the wrong direction all interfere with the already dubious pleasure of swimming. Perhaps these are the same people who are responsible for a very different kind of lane indiscipline: hogging the middle lane on motorways. If it weren't for these roadhogs, according to the RAC's executive director, Edmund King, congestion on our motorways could be wiped out virtually overnight. <p>If you are a middle-lane laggard, I hope you're ashamed of yourself. But then, I'd be very surprised if you confessed to being one. There are lots of bad drivers in Britain, but they are always other people. This is very convenient, because it stops us having to confront the possibility that maybe we share the responsibility for the gridlocking of our roads, the 3,600 road deaths every year and the pollution caused by traffic. </p> <p>What is it about middle-lane plodders that's so irritating? Is it because they are dangerous? In the grand scheme of things, doing a steady 60mph in the middle lane ranks pretty low in the scale of risky motoring activities. If safety were the issue, tired, fast, drunk, drugged and mobile phone-using drivers would all irritate us more. </p> <p>The sense that driving brings, of being in complete control, is a serious problem. In the clicking of a door lock, it causes people to forget that it is not just other people who have accidents. Being in control of a vehicle seems to give people a sense of invulnerable omnipotence. The consequences of this for road safety are well known. People believe that they are capable of driving fast and safely, even though we all know that speed is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. Many still insist that they drive better after a drink or two, even though we know studies show that driving confidence increases as competence decreases. Then there is the under-studied phenomenon of people taking their cars for a post-spliff spin, even though a study a few years back suggested that up to half of drivers killed in road accidents had illegal drugs in their systems. </p> <p>I suspect the real reason that dawdling drivers irritate is that they stop us being masters of our motoring universes. Getting stuck behind someone else is an unwelcome reminder that on the roads, our fates also depend on others. This self-evident truth, however, is deeply unwelcome, for it strikes against the individualism that permeates the psyche of the driver. Strapping yourself into the driver's seat unleashes the egotist within, turning otherwise generous people turn into selfish monsters. </p> <p>At this point, I should admit that I do not drive. Not that this is a proof of my virtue. Although I am no frequent flyer, my annual air miles pump more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than a year of driving would. Nor do I think I am immune to the character flaws so readily displayed by motorists. When I took some lessons a few years back, I was amazed at how little time it took for both fear to vanish and for 30mph to seem ridiculously slow. If there are psychological traps drivers fall into, I'm sure I would stumble into them as carelessly as the next man. Driving is a form of intoxication, and lane hoggers are like a sobering ice-cold glass of water in the face, and just as irritating. </p> <p>But it is the intoxication that is the real problem, one we resolutely refuse to deal with, and the people who moan loudest who are often the most car-drunk. They are the problem: overdependent on their cars, critical of other road users but not themselves, and frustrated by anything that puts a brake on their speed. </p> <p>A lot has been written on the rights and wrongs of transport policy, but perhaps we need to think more about transport psychology. Middle-lane drivers and their critics have both taken an empathy bypass, since neither fully appreciates their individual impact on the traffic congestion that affects everyone. It's time they both pulled over and considered what is driving the driver. </p> <p><b>New spouse price panic</b></p> <p>With the average wedding now costing \u00a316,000, analysts are openly speculating whether the spouse-price bubble will burst. First-time wedders are particularly vulnerable and many can no longer afford to get on to the first step of the marriage ladder. They are forced to rent their partners on short-term, usually verbal contracts, and can no longer look forward to the security of fully owning a spouse in old age. </p> <p>Some, however, are beginning to question the British obsession with spouse-owning. What's wrong with leasing a partner? Ownership brings extra responsibilities and pressures and severely limits your freedom. Spouse ownership also brings the risk of negative equity: ending up with less than you put into the relationship. Nor is a spouse necessarily a guarantee of security: many are forced to sell up when things go wrong, leaving them with large legal and maintenance bills. </p> <p>Why is it, then, that people continue to dream of a spouse of their own? One explanation is that renting becomes tiresome. All that partner hunting, dragging yourself off to see something that is either thoroughly decrepit or way out of your league, and then having to compromise with something that never really feels as if it's yours. </p> <p>Then there's peer pressure. When all your friends are buying, it's easy to feel as though you're being left behind and failing to take on the full responsibilities of adulthood. </p> <p>But perhaps all these pragmatic, somewhat cynical explanations miss the point. For what really spurs people to buy is the conviction that they have found the spouse they never want to move on from. With the market so volatile, we may think they're taking a risk. But who can blame them for taking their chances?</p>",
  "Prior to today, Sir Mark Thatcher's most notable incursion into the national consciousness was when he went missing in the Sahara desert in 1982, while his mother, Margaret Thatcher, was prime minister. <p>The 29-year-old was competing in the Paris-Dakar rally, when his white Peugeot 504 went missing on January 10 near the Malian-Algerian border. Mrs Thatcher put out a statement saying she was \"very upset and very distressed\" - but continued her prime ministerial duties as normal.</p> <p>After six days, his car was spotted by planes as he, his co-driver and their mechanic were running short of food and water. His father, Denis, flew him back to the UK in the Algerian presidential plane, as Mrs Thatcher told waiting reporters the scare had \"put [her] other personal worries into perspective\".</p> <p>Born in 1953, Mark Thatcher is one of twins - his sister Carol went on to become a journalist, and, briefly, girlfriend of disgraced Tory minister Jonathan Aitken.</p> <p>Mark was educated at Harrow, a prestigious public school. Academically unexceptional, he excelled at racket sports, and acquired a taste for fast cars which was later to get him into trouble. He crashed twice after he took up the sport seriously in the 1970s, while also training for a career as an accountant with Touche Ross.</p> <p>After emigrating to the US, he dated a string of eligible American women before marrying Diane Burgdorf, a millionaire heiress to a second-hand car dealership, on St Valentine's Day in 1987. </p> <p>The couple settled down in Dallas, Texas, with Mark's company, Monteagle Marketing, pushing whisky and clothing lines and bringing him a small personal fortune.</p> <p>But hit controversy in 1984 when the Observer alleged that he benefited from his mother's position when a large construction deal in Oman was awarded to a building firm, Cementation, with which he was involved, after Mrs Thatcher visited the tiny Gulf state. The accusations were never proven.</p> <p>Further controversy dogged him through his friendship with the Middle East businessman Wafic Said - a quiet-spoken Syrian with close links with Saudi royalty. </p> <p>Among other business ventures in the 1980s, he was involved in several large-scale arms deals, most notably a \u00a320bn contract between British Aerospace and Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Although rumours of impropriety have dogged his business career, he largely disappeared off Fleet Street's radar after moving to the US.</p> <p>But it is recorded that his wealth grew to the point where he spent periods as a tax exile in Switzerland.</p> <p>In the 1990s he helped secure the multimillion pound contract for his mother's Downing Street memoirs, but after the failure of a security alarm business in the US and a prosecution for tax evasion, Mark, his wife and their two children moved again - this time to South Africa.</p> <p>Three years after the move to Cape Town, in 1998, he was investigated by South African police over a money-lending business to police officers. He counter-claimed that officers working for him as agents had defrauded him and the investigation was eventually dropped.</p> <p>He returned to the UK last July for the funeral of his father, Sir Denis, a former oil businessman, who died aged 88. He inherited his father's hereditary baronetcy to become Sir Mark.</p> <p>Sir Mark, who was known as \"Thickie Mork\" among other nicknames at Harrow and who has been criticised for his lack of charm, was once described by the Financial Times as \"a sort of Harrovian Arthur Daley with a famous Mum\". </p> <p>A devoted Lady Thatcher, however, has always had faith in him. \"Mark could sell snow to the Eskimos, and sand to the Arabs,\" she is reported to have said. </p> <p>His notoriety was not welcomed by Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former press secretary. </p> <p>Asked by Sir Mark how he could best help his mother win the 1987 general election, Ingham reportedly replied: \"Leave the country.\"</p>",
  "Sir Mark Thatcher, the son of former British prime minister Lady Thatcher, tonight said he was \"innocent of all charges\" relating to his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea. <p>The 51-year-old businessman, arrested this morning during a 7am raid on his house in Cape Town, was charged under South Africa's anti-mercenary laws in connection with an alleged coup attempt in the oil-rich state.</p> <p>\"I am innocent of all charges made against me. I have been and am cooperating fully with the authorities in order to resolve the matter,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>\"I have no involvement in an alleged coup in Equatorial Guinea and I reject all suggestions to the contrary.\"</p> <p>There was no comment from Lady Thatcher, who is on holiday in America and is expected to return to the UK on Friday. </p> <p>Sir Mark's lawyer, Peter Hodes, told Sky News that his client had already been charged with an offence relating to \"the purchase of a helicopter, and some connection with the Equatorial Guinea coup attempt\". </p> <p>Sir Mark was brought before a magistrates court in Cape Town before being released. Bail was set at 2m Rand (\u00a3166,822) and Sir Mark must return to court in November. He could receive a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment if convicted of the offence.</p> <p>In an unexpected twist of events, his appearance before the magistrates was delayed when he was robbed in a crowded holding cell. His shoes, jacket and cell phone were taken, according to a court official who witnessed the attack.</p> <p>His early morning arrest came as trials relating to the alleged coup attempt were taking place in two countries. Briton Simon Mann, a neighbour of Sir Mark's in the upmarket suburb of Constantia, is one of 70 men on trial in Zimbabwe charged with immigration and aviation offences and possession of dangerous weapons. The Old Etonian and former SAS officer turned mercenary is the alleged ringleader.</p> <p>A further 19 people are on trial in Malabo, capital of Equatorial Guinea. They are charged with attempting to assassinate a head of state, illegal possession of arms and explosives, terrorism, treason and endangering the public. Verdicts in their cases are expected on Saturday.</p> <p>The men on trial include South African arms dealer Nick du Toit, who told the court yesterday that his co-accused in Malabo were never told what they were being recruited for.</p> <p>The alleged plotters were said to be hoping to exploit the country's massive oil reserves after overthrowing President Teodoro Obiang and installing their own leader, Severo Moto, currently in exile in Spain. Mr Du Toit faces possible execution and his co-defendants prison sentences of up to 86 years.</p> <p>One defendant, a German, died in prison in Equatorial Guinea after what Amnesty International said was suspected torture.</p> <p>Police with search warrants raided Sir Mark's home shortly after 7am local time. While Sir Mark was in custody at his home, investigators searched his records and computers for evidence.</p> <p>South African prosecuting authority spokesman Makhosini Nkosi said: \"We are currently conducting a search and seizure operation at the house of a Cape Town man who is a British citizen.\"</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are investigating the possibility that he has been involved in the funding of logistical support to the people who are involved in the alleged coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea.\" </p> <p>Pumping 350,000 barrels of oil a day, Equatorial Guinea has become Africa's third-largest oil producer since offshore development began in the mid-90s.</p> <p>The country has accused British and South African oil broker Ely Calil and other foreign financiers of funding the alleged coup attempt. Mr Calil has denied any involvement.</p> <p>President Obiang has ruled the isolated nation with an iron fist since taking power from, and executing, his uncle in 1979.</p>",
  "<p>The children of Enzo Baldoni, the Italian journalist being held hostage in Iraq, have issued a plea for their father's release after a militant group said it could not guarantee his safety unless Italy withdrew its troops from Iraq.</p> <p>Baldoni's daughter, Gabriella, and her brother, Guido, appeared on Italian television today to urge their father's captors to release him, saying he was a pacifist who wanted to show solidarity with those suffering in the conflict. </p> <p>\"We address the Iraqi people, tormented by war, and to the men who are holding our father Enzo,\" </p> <p>\"Enzo Baldoni is in Iraq as a man of peace, in addition to being there as a journalist,\" she said. \"He was trying to save human lives in Najaf, offering his help to a Red Cross convoy, in the spirit of solidarity that has always marked his thoughts and his actions.\" </p> <p>\"In this spirit, we ask you to let us embrace him alive,\" Gabriella Baldoni, said in the appeal, which was also to be shown on al-Jazeera, according to Italian reports. </p> <p>Baldoni, a freelance journalist on his first trip to Iraq, was shown apparently in the hands of extremists in Iraq on video footage broadcast this week by al-Jazeera. </p> <p>The militant group, calling itself \"The Islamic Army in Iraq\", did not threaten Baldoni directly but said in a statement it could not guarantee his safety unless Italy announced within 48 hours that it will withdraw its troops from Iraq.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the president of Radio France said today he believed it was likely that Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, the two French journalists who disappeared on Friday en route to Najaf, were still alive.</p> <p>Jean-Paul Cluzel declined to give any further information about the whereabouts of Chesnot, a freelance reporter for the broadcaster, and Le Figaro's Iraq correspondent Malbrunot.</p> <p>But he praised the French embassy staff and said he hoped their actions would secure the release of the two journalists.</p> <p>Baldoni, who went to Iraq as a freelancer for the news magazine Diario, was reported missing on Friday by the Italian foreign ministry. </p> <p>Diario's editor-in-chief, Enrico Deaglio, said Baldoni had taken part in two convoys - one of the Red Crescent and one of the Italian Red Cross - taking food supplies from Baghdad to Najaf. </p> <p>In Rome, the Italian government insisted that it was not withdrawing its contingent in Iraq despite the militants' demand.</p> <p>\"It is clear that there's not a chance that their request be met,\" Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Wednesday. </p> <p>Baldoni is a part-time journalist, whose main job is as an advertising copywriter; another hobby is translating comic strips, such as Garry Trudeau's \"Doonesbury\". On a weblog he kept while in Iraq, Baldoni described himself as a \"war tourist\", yet in other reported comments he has insisted he wasn't simply out for cheap thrills. </p> <p>Over the past eight years, he has reported in Chiapas, Mexico; East Timor; Myanmar; and Colombia. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "The United States is to allow three British citizens and two British residents their first access to a lawyer since being imprisoned in Guant\u00e1namo Bay over two years ago. <p>The granting of a legal visit next Monday is being hailed as a key stage in trying to get the Britons freed from Guant\u00e1namo, where they have been held as suspected terrorists without charge or trial. </p> <p>The US granted the visits after the supreme court ruled the base in occupied Cuba was covered by American law, despite the Bush administration claiming it was not. Reports suggest that Moazzam Begg and Feroz Abbasi have been suffering mental health problems while imprisoned. </p> <p>Both have been held in isolation for up to a year, with Mr Begg having been detained in a windowless room. He is also believed to now be denied human contact after he started talking to his guards, and is monitored by a remote controlled camera. </p> <p>Two US lawyers representing the Britons are scheduled to arrive in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, next Monday. </p> <p>As well as Mr Begg and Mr Abbasi, they are expected to see Martin Mubanga, and two Londoners whom the Foreign Office refuses to represent. </p> <p>They are Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi national from Kingston-upon-Thames where he has lived for 20 years, who has been interrogated more than 50 times according to testimony from released British detainees. </p> <p>A lawyer will also see Jamil el-Banna, a Jordanian refugee, who is alleged to have been sexually humiliated while detained and to also be suffering mental health problems, according to three released British detainees. </p> <p>The lawyer Gitanjali Gutierrez, who will see Mr Begg and Mr Abbasi over four days, said the visit would help prepare their habeas corpus petitions in the US courts which she hopes will see them freed. </p> <p>Ms Gutierrez said the Pentagon was trying to apply conditions on the visit that she regards as unacceptable. </p> <p>These include reading the notes made by the lawyers of their meetings with the Britons and monitoring any mail between the two. </p> <p>Ms Gutierrez said negotiations are continuing for the Pentagon to drop these conditions. It has already agreed that the meetings will not be monitored. </p> <p>She said that one of the biggest challenges will be getting the Britons to believe that she is a lawyer there to help them: \"It's going to take a great deal of time to get their trust. They've been held in isolation for a year, and have only had contact with military interrogators and UK officials, some of whom have taken part in the interrogations.\" </p> <p>The so-called Tipton Three released from Guant\u00e1namo Bay in March alleged systematic beatings and ill-treatment by the US authorities. </p> <p>But tight US rules mean that any claims of ill-treatment made by the Britons to their lawyers may have to be kept secret, said Steven Watt of the Centre for Constitutional Rights: \"There's a possibility that any information the attorney is given, they will not be able to make public because of Pentagon rules, and that includes the conditions they've been held under and the treatment they've received.\" </p> <p>The US can order that anything which is deemed to cover national security be kept a secret. A total of four Britons and four British residents remain in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Osama bin Laden's chauffeur was formally charged yesterday at a pretrial hearing as his lawyer challenged the legality of the hearings. </p> <p>US officials allege Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a 34-year-old Yemeni, served as the al-Qaida leader's bodyguard and delivered weapons to his operatives. He was charged with conspiracy as an al-Qaida member to commit war crimes, including attacking civilian targets, murder, destroying property and terrorism.</p>",
  "No one doubts that a desperately poor country such as Afghanistan needs humanitarian assistance; but many are asking whether the benefits that aid workers bring outweigh the price that they are being asked to pay. Hearing of the murder of friends and colleagues, of aid convoys being ambushed, premises rocketed and mortared, or of vehicles booby-trapped has led to growing anguish and anger. <p>Over the past 12 months around 40 of my fellow aid workers have been murdered in Afghanistan. Virtually every humanitarian organisation has had its staff or offices threatened or attacked. I narrowly missed being caught up in an attack a few weeks before I left, and one of our Norwegian Refugee Council offices was bombed on the day I stepped down. Much of the country is now off-limits to humanitarian organisations, and in areas where we still operate, there are curfews and restrictions of movement. Conditions are expected to get worse in the run-up to October's elections. </p> <p>Most non-governmental organisations continue to refuse to accept armed guards or escorts, but the militarised environment in which we work is having an impact on our identity and the way in which we are perceived by others. </p> <p>One reason why most humanitarian organisations pulled out of Iraq was the feeling that we had become identified with an operation that many believe violated international law, so our presence compromised our neutrality. </p> <p>Humanitarian organisations have long invoked principles of international law to claim \"space\" within which to operate during conflicts. Indeed one of the most widely understood points in the Geneva conventions is the special position accorded to humanitarian organisations. The US administration, however, has set many of these principles to one side in pursuit of its own unilateralist goals. </p> <p>In Afghanistan the US has been accused of blurring the lines between humanitarianism and military action and this was one of the reasons cited by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) for its recent withdrawal from the country. This criticism is certainly valid, but it is only one area in which American short-term expediency is having a negative long-term impact. </p> <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council gives advice to returning refugees who are seeking to reclaim property that they lost when they were driven from their homes. A significant proportion of its clients have found their land and homes occupied by military commanders, some of whom also hold official public positions. </p> <p>The US military's decision to provide direct military support to particular local commanders in its fight against the remnants of the Taliban in 2002 entrenched many of these warlords and led to the creation of a number of regional fiefdoms. It also convinced many that as allies in the US's \"war against terrorism\" they were above the law. </p> <p>Tackling corruption is a prerequisite for effective state-building but, if this year's bumper poppy harvest is anything to go by, the situation is getting worse not better. There is credible evidence that the Afghan authorities know who murdered MSF staff in June, yet they have made no move to question or detain them. Afghanistan is a party to the international criminal court and murdering humanitarian aid workers is an offence under this court's statute. Given the unwillingness of the authorities to act, the court's prosecutor could initiate independent investigations into such crimes. Unfortunately the present US administration remains unremittingly hostile to the international criminal court. </p> <p>Rebuilding a rule of law according to international human rights standards is also essential in creating a democratic state, but again the US is failing to take a lead. Few aid workers were surprised at recent revelations that \"freelance\" American security operatives allegedly set up a private prison where they detained and tortured suspected opponents of the Afghan government. Afghanistan is full of private prisons where people are held without trial. </p> <p>However, while the US continues to hold large numbers of its own detainees, incommunicado, for indefinite periods they are in a weak position to criticise others. When I asked one Afghan judge why he had made no official complaint after hearing two detainees' allegations of mistreatment in US military custody, he told me, only half joking, that he did not want to end up in Guant\u00e1namo Bay himself. </p> <p>US involvement in Afghanistan is not all negative: it remains the biggest donor and provides the biggest contingent of foreign troops, although they are not part of the internationally mandated security force. </p> <p>The question that remains is whether this makes up for the growing politicisation of aid, the undermining of international law and the weakening of humanitarian principles. For the colleagues I left behind, this is quite literally a life and death dilemma. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Conor Foley was programme manager of the Norwegian Refugee Council's legal aid project in Afghanistan from July 2003 - July 2004 </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:conorfoley30@hotmail.com\">conorfoley30@hotmail.com</a></p>",

  "There was only one message on the banners and posters dotted around Islamabad's streets as the motorcade whizzed past amid tight security: \"Pakistan welcomes Hamid Karzai\". But the warm greeting belied the sensitivity of the moment for the interim Afghan leader and his host, President Pervez Musharraf. <p>Mr Karzai is worried about Taliban insurgents, who are threatening to upset next month's presidential elections. Many are thought to use Pakistan as a base. General Musharraf offered his unqualified help. \"Anybody trying to disrupt the election process ... will not be allowed from Pakistan. We will act against them,\" he vowed. </p> <p>These days Gen Musharraf's promises carry extra weight, following a six-week drive against al-Qaida in Pakistan. From the back-streets of Karachi to the tribal highlands, his security services have prosecuted an unrelenting campaign against Osama bin Laden's network. </p> <p>Hardly a day passes without the announcement of fresh arrests, foiled bomb plots, or military operations along the Afghan border. So far the security services - invigorated by a wave of suicide attacks on government and army figures - have detained over 70 suspected militants. They include Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian wanted in connection with the 1998 US embassy bombings in east Africa, and Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan, a Pakistani computer expert whose plans for new attacks sparked alerts in London, New York and New Jersey. </p> <p>Britain and the US are delighted with the sweep, which has burnished Gen Musharraf's standing as a central strategic ally. But they also admit that beneath the successes of the Pakistani army lies an underbelly rooted in its long-standing links with Islamic extremism. Many of the suspects being rounded up were originally recruited by the ISI, the army's intelligence service, to fight in Kashmir or Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s. Now cut adrift from Pakistan, many have found a calling in al-Qaida. It is unclear whether some of their handlers have gone with them. \"It's great having a savage dog that attacks other people,\" said a diplomat, \"but not if it turns on you.\" </p> <p>In the past week suspected hideouts have been bombed in the mountains and forests of South Waziristan, where militants are sheltering under the protection of tribesmen. There is also frequent speculation that Bin Laden or his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, are hiding in the same area. </p> <p>Last week Gen Musharraf's government published a \"wanted\" poster for its six most wanted militants, offering rewards of up to $340,000 per head. The highest price was offered for Abu Faraj Farj, a Libyan, who is suspected to have coordinated much al-Qaida activity in Pakistan. </p> <p>The hunt for suspects appears to have encouraged police brutality. Last week a radical cleric, Qari Noor Mohammed, died in custody after a raid on an Islamic school in Faisalabad. Police said Mr Mohammed suffered a heart attack; human rights activists said he had been tortured. </p> <p>In response, al-Qaida has transformed its tactics. Having long considered Pakistan as a rear base, it has now turned its sights on the violent overthrow of the Pakistani state. In the past year suicide bombers have nearly succeeded in killing Gen Musharraf, an army commander, and Shaukat Aziz, due to be appointed prime minister this week. Last weekend the security services claimed they had foiled a plot to blow up the national convention centre, Gen Musharraf's house and the US embassy. </p> <p>But although outsiders are thought to have coordinated the terror operations, Pakistani militants have provided the manpower. Many are drawn from radical Islamic groups once nurtured by the ISI. They include Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a sectarian Sunni group that fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Harkatul Mujahideen, which has supported the Pakistan army in its war with India. </p> <p>Not only have the militants turned against the Pakistani state, but diplomats worry that some of their handlers - mid- to low-level intelligence operatives - have not shed all their ties. \"There's a lot of dirty laundry,\" said one. \"If you have spent 15 years running Jihadis in Kashmir and Afghanistan, and then one day someone tells you to stop - it's very difficult.\" </p> <p>The army denies any such fissures persist. \"This is a professional army where orders are followed. Anyone who refuses to do so will get his ass kicked,\" said Major General Shaukat Sultan. </p> <p>Analysts say the army is struggling with the product of its longstanding association with Islamists. \"I think we are reaping what we sowed in the 1970s and 1980s,\" said Talat Masood, a retired general. \"The process of the militarisation of society, strengthening the forces of radicalism - has come back to haunt us. </p> <p>The militants are also being drawn from less traditional strands. In contrast with the Islamists, who mainly come from poor backgrounds, computer expert Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan was a qualified engineer from a middle class Karachi family who had studied at City University, London.</p>",
  "<p>\"Only the National Youth Theatre,\" the publicity cheekily asserts, \"would think to do Mikhail Bulgakov's panoramic novel.\" In fact, Chichester is already staging its own carnivalesque spectacular. But, even if it has been sumptuously pre-empted, John Hoggarth's NYT production has a mad energy of its own to which I gradually surrendered. </p> <p>David Rudkin's adaptation differs sharply from Edward Kemp's Chichester version in several respects. It sticks closer to Bulgakov's narrative structure but transposes the action from Stalinist Moscow to our own present-day world. </p> <p>This leads to barbed jokes at the expense of illiberal immigration policies, media moguls, heritage theatre and consumerist culture. But, whatever the sins of our society, they hardly compare with the vicious apparatus of Stalinism which Bulgakov was lethally satirising. </p> <p>The real star is designer Laura Hopkins who creates a world that can plausibly contain the disruptive devil and his party, the dramatist-hero and his redemptive Margarita and even the former's Biblical play about Pontius Pilate. Hopkins's design is based on three rotating, giant staircases which leads to one tremendous effect: during Satan's midnight rout Margarita is perched atop a detachable plinth while a procession of madmen and malefactors pay her homage. At this point Bulgakov unites with the surreal strangeness of a Busby Berkeley musical. </p> <p>Inevitably, the acting is uneven. But Tom Allen as the Mephistophelian Woland suggests a stylish mix of Cole Porter and Martin Amis, Shakira Brooking lends Margarita a statuesque grace and Ben Garlick is a suitably perplexed Pilate. Hoggarth also marshals his forces with some skill and, even if Bulgakov's epic satire is too much of its time and place to be de-Russified, you have to admire the NYT's reckless audacity. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until September 11, box office: 08700 500 511.</p>",
  "We've all heard about walking being the ultimate path to fitness and better health, but how about as a recipe for helping refugees to integrate into local communities? <p>It's not as far-fetched an idea as it might seem, according to the Ramblers' Association. Its Walking Out campaign, launched earlier this year to help people who feel excluded from the countryside - perhaps because they live in an inner city and are on low incomes - to get out and enjoy it, has produced some promising side-effects.</p> <p>The walks, which are based in and around Lincoln, Stoke-on-Trent and Sheffield, have attracted significant numbers of refugees and, according to the organisers and those taking part, are helping people get to know their new communities and to establish friendships.</p> <p>Shirin Slami, an Iranian refugee who has become a regular walker, lives in Sheffield with her husband and two children. The family came to the UK from Tehran three years ago. Strolling along the canals during a walk in Sheffield last week with her daughter and a group of regular ramblers, she oozes enthusiasm as she says: \"It is a really lovely thing to do, meeting such lovely, friendly people. It means we meet other families and talk to people. We have been to the seaside and the children loved it, and on the last walk [in the Peak District] there were six Iranian families.\"</p> <p>Shirin's daughter, Elnaz, 12, was also on the walk. \"The walks are really good,\" she says. \"We come and meet different people, and I get to learn about nature and the local area. I think people learn from us too.\"</p> <p>The Ramblers' Association says the feedback from the walks has been encouraging and that it hopes to widen the project to other areas.</p> <p>\"Walking Out is very much a new departure for us,\" a spokeswoman says. \"Our primary charitable aim is to encourage walking, and we feel that many sections of society feel excluded from this activity and the countryside. In many cases, this includes refugees, and taking part in the walks has proved popular with different refugee communities.\"</p> <p>The association has established links with the Northern Refugee Centre, where Helen Todd, a development worker with the organisation, says the relationship is paying off and is reaping rewards for the refugees who take part.</p> <p>\"We have had families from Somalia, Iran, Kosovo and other countries, and they really seem to get something special out of the experience,\" she says. \"The families are getting a chance to explore the areas around them and to form friendships with local people. It's a great way to break down barriers.\"</p>",
  "Compare and contrast two events yesterday. First the foreign secretary's trip to Sudan. Yesterday Jack Straw visited the country's Darfur region, where the Abu Shouk camp houses some 60,000 refugees, who have fled from attacks on their villages by the Janjaweed militia. About 1.2 million people live in camps in Sudan, most of them in much worse conditions than Abu Shouk. Overcrowded and insanitary, the camps expose their malnourished inhabitants to a plethora of diseases: diarrhoea, cholera and dysentery among them. According to the UN, at least 600 people are dying a day. <p>The second event was the release of the UK's latest asylum statistics by the Home Office. A spokeswoman proudly declared the UK had cut the overall number of applications by 70% since October 2002. Even Tony Blair's arbitrarily crude target only sought a 50% reduction. But the reduction did not satisfy the Conservatives, who described this year's 13% fall as a meaningless small number, nor the right wing anti-immigrants of Migrationwatch, which dismissed the figures, which were independently audited, as \"another spin operation\". Only the Liberal Democrats among the major parties spoke out against the target. Its spokesman, Mark Oaten, said the numbers seeking asylum should be \"based on the international situation, not the government's reaction to tabloid hysteria\". </p> <p>An opinion poll last year suggested the British public believes the UK receives 23% of the world's refugees. Here is one measure of the effectiveness of tabloid and political attacks on British asylum policy. In reality, the entire European Union only accepts 3% of the world's refugees; moreover, the UK is not even top of the European league, standing eighth in 2002 in terms of refugees per head of population. Right across the world the numbers of refugees actually fell last year, according to a report from Ruud Lubbers, the UN high commissioner for refugees, released in June. The 20% fall brought the numbers under UNHCR care down to 17 million, the lowest level for 10 years. Two factors were responsible for the fall: the ending of several major conflicts and success in getting more people home, some of whom had been in refugee camps for years and, in some cases, decades. </p> <p>Even so, 17 million people is still a huge number. Over 90% of refugees remain in their home region, where the UNHCR has little over \u00a330 a year to cover each individual refugee's needs. The 10% who reach developed states initially cost \u00a310,000, although once settled quickly begin paying more tax than they receive in benefits. The UK has floated the idea of transferring to the UNHCR much of the money used in the west to fund asylum applications so that special protected areas could be established, where refugees would be initially assessed. This is not too different from the UNHCR's wish for more funds to create \"safe havens\" in regions with high refugee movements for initial assessments. As long as the schemes include a managed flow to the west and do not end the right of individuals who get here to have their asylum claims properly assessed, the plan deserves a proper trial. Remember: the top five industrial states alone - including the UK - spend over \u00a310bn a year on immigration control, two-thirds of the amount provided in overseas aid. </p> <p>Mr Lubbers is right to urge Europe to forge a common approach. The European Commission has been valiantly trying to devise a scheme to end the current demeaning pass-the-parcel European procedures. Britain, meanwhile, needs a more grown-up debate about the issues. Five separate pieces of legislation in a decade have produced lots of measures to keep illegal immigrants out, without introducing new safeguards to ensure genuine refugees are guaranteed the protection that international law bestows.</p>",
  "The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, signalled yesterday that the Sudanese government may have done enough to escape sanctions when the United Nations deadline runs out on Monday. <p>The UN last month gave the Sudanese government four weeks to take steps to tackle the Darfur crisis that has cost 30,000 lives and left more than one million homeless. </p> <p>Mr Straw yesterday visited one of the biggest refugee camps, Abu Shouk, near El Fesher, and held talks in Khartoum with the Sudanese president, Omar el-Bashir. </p> <p>The humanitarian crisis is the result of a harsh crackdown by the Sudanese government in Darfur after a rebellion last year. </p> <p>Mr Straw denied the international community was going soft on the Sudan government: \"This is a very imperfect situation.\" </p> <p>He said the Sudanese government had made progress in allowing humanitarian agencies to visit the camps and that aerial bombardment of villages by the Sudanese air force appeared to have stopped since June. </p> <p>But he added that not enough had been done to protect those in the camps or to provide the sense of security that would allow them to return to their villages. </p> <p>At a press conference at the British embassy in Khartoum last night, Mr Straw coupled emollient words for the Sudanese government with a warning: \"The last thing we want to be in the international community is in conflict with the government of Sudan, but we do have clear responsibilities to the UN charter to ensure that this kind of humanitarian disaster is averted.\" </p> <p>Refugees complain that the Sudanese military and air force have continued to join irregular Janjaweed militia in attacks on their villages and that they are harassed by the Janjaweed that surround the camps. </p> <p>Sudanese security was more in evidence than usual yesterday for Mr Straw's visit to the camp, home to more than 60,000 refugees, living in basic plastic tents. Aid workers said there were many more police on duty than normal. </p> <p>Mr Straw spent 90 minutes talking to refugees and aid workers. Although life in the camp is harsh, it is one of the best-organised in Darfur, prompting a British official to describe it as the \"Hilton\" of refugee camps. </p> <p>Mr Straw admitted the camp was not typical: \"This is one of the best camps in Sudan and I am not seeing a cross-section.\" </p> <p>He later held talks in Khartoum with the UN special envoy to Sudan, Jan Pronk, who is to make a three-day visit to Darfur from tomorrow accompanied by Sudanese government officials to make a final assessment on whether Khartoum has done enough over the last four weeks. Mr Pronk will present his assessment to the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, ahead of the UN deadline on Monday and will brief the security council on September 2.</p> <p>The security council will have to decide whether to impose sanctions or give the Sudanese government an extension. Divisions on the security council make it likely the Sudanese government will be given at least another month.</p> <p>In an early indication of the in-fighting ahead on the security council, three members - Pakistan, Algeria and China - yesterday opposed a US and British request for a routine update on the Darfur crisis from Mr Annan's office. The meeting went ahead anyway. </p> <p>The UN last month set various requirements for compliance by the Sudanese government. </p> <p>Mr Straw said: \"The issue is not whether everything has been resolved by the 30-day period set by the security council, but whether the government of Sudan is on track to do that and also whether the rebel groups, some of which are supported by other countries, are meeting their obligations.\" </p> <p>At negotiations in Nigeria, the two main rebel groups from Darfur refused to lay down their weapons until the Janjaweed were disarmed. The negotiations are set to continue today.</p>",
  "The Home Office last night claimed to be winning its battle to restore public confidence in its immigration and asylum policies after asylum applications fell by 13% to 9,210 between April and June. <p>It brought asylum applications back to their lowest level since 1997, when Tony Blair inherited a shambolic Conservative system. Inflated by war refugees and poor administration, numbers peaked in late 2002, but have fallen 70% since. </p> <p>Though critics were quick to protest that the number of asylum seekers and their dependants being deported was 9% down - chiefly, officials said, because many are citizens of new EU member states - ministers believe they are finally achieving a \"balanced\" policy which cuts abuse but protects the vulnerable. </p> <p>Year on year there was a record number of such removals in 2003: 13,005 or 21% up on 2002; 29% if dependants are included. While numbers are now falling, the proportion being removed or leaving vol untarily is higher - to the dismay of asylum support groups and the delight of the tabloids. </p> <p>The immigration minister, Des Browne, said: \"We have cut abuse and are protecting our borders, while at the same time offering a haven to those genuinely fleeing persecution, and providing controlled legal routes for workers who want to make a contribution to the UK and where it is in the interests of our economy.\" </p> <p>That is the managed migration policy of the home secretary, David Blunkett, in a nutshell, and yesterday's figures also showed 139,675 people were allowed to settle in the UK in 2003 - 20% up on 2002. They include 29,600 people who have lived and worked in Britain for at least four years. </p> <p>It prompted MigrationWatch, the watchdog chaired by former ambassador Sir Andrew Green, to brand the figures as spin, because the fall in asylum applications is below the EU trend: \"Removals are down despite the fact that only one in five of failed asylum seekers is removed. The government are clearly seeking to distract attention from the wider issue of immigration.\" </p> <p> <b> <b>\u00b7</b> </b> The detention charity, Bail for Immigration Detainees, protested last night at a six-fold rise in asylum-seeker children being detained by British immigration compared with last December, one in six of them for more than two weeks.</p>"
