  "Four years on, the US presidential election is again a dead heat betweense a radical conservative and a mainstream liberal. And once more, Ralph Nader's oddball candidacy threatens to tip the delicate balance to the right. <p>This time the consumer activist is a much reduced force. The overwhelming majority of his closest aides and supporters have defected, including Michael Moore. The film-maker went down on his knees on cable television to beg Mr Nader to withdraw. Even his former running mate, Winona LaDuke, has come out for John Kerry. </p> <p>Four years ago, Mr Nader was the Green party candidate, backed by its modest but enthusiastic machine. </p> <p>This time, he is on his own. All he has is patchy backing, in some states, of the Reform party, a conservative, libertarian group a long, long way from his progressive roots. </p> <p>Mr Nader took 2.7% in 2000. In recent weeks, his rating has been closer to 1%. But that support is up to 4%, in some of the swing states. In any case, 1% can easily be the difference between victory and defeat for President George Bush and Senator Kerry. </p> <p>In 2000 Mr Nader took almost 100,000 votes in Florida. Al Gore lost (after supreme court intervention) by 537 votes. That is why the Democratic party, abetted by many former \"Nader's Raiders\", shock troops of the civic activism Mr Nader pioneered, have spent six months desperately trying to keep him off the ballot papers. </p> <p>Like all civil wars, it has been nasty. \"It's beyond bitter,\" said Toby Moffett, formerly one of Mr Nader's oldest friends and now leader of the legal campaign to stop him. \"He likes to say whoever used to be in his movement and is now against him is corrupt and a sellout. We think he has totally lost his bearings.\" </p> <p>The Nader campaign has been helped by rightwingers well aware of its potential to split the progressive vote. Naderites have also resorted to dubious means to obtain signatures on state petitions to get his name on the ballot. Homeless people were paid for every signature they collected; thousands were found to have been forged in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, scrawled alongside names and addresses copied out of a phone directory. </p> <p>Anti-Nader forces, meanwhile, have fought a legal war of attrition, bringing one case after another with the intention of driving him out of the race. </p> <p>They have not succeeded. The 70-year-old is an independent in every sense. Political isolation only deepens his martyr's sense of righteousness. \"I always thought that running for elective office is the consummate expression of the right to free speech, assembly, and petition under our first amendment. It shouldn't be that difficult in a democracy to get on the ballot,\" he told University of Minnesota students. </p> <p>He has fought his way on to the ballot in nearly 40 states. But legal objections to the dodgy signatures in Ohio and Pennsylvania have kept him out of two of the tightest and biggest battlegrounds, and the legal struggle has drained his resources. The anti-Nader campaign, combined with Senator Kerry's powerful performance in the debates and outspoken opposition to the Iraq war, have helped erode Mr Nader's backing in the polls from 5% in the spring to the current 1% rump. </p> <p>Anna Greenberg, a pollster with Democratic party ties, said the Nader vote was now very different from four years ago. Its profile now more closely resembles the voters who backed Ross Perot, a maverick conservative Texan who ran in 1992 and 1996. </p> <p>\"In 2000 you had younger collegeeducated males who were progressive and interested in environmentalist issues,\" she said. \"This time it's more like the Perot vote in the 90s: economically populist, anti-corporate, blue collar. They are much more conservative than Nader 2000.\" </p> <p>According to recent Gallup figures, when Nader supporters were asked who they would vote for if he were not on the ballot, 52 % opted for Mr Bush. Ms Greenberg disagrees. Her polling tells her Mr Nader still hurts Mr Kerry more than Mr Bush, although by a much smaller degree than a few months ago. </p> <p>In swing states where Mr Nader has slightly more backing, Iowa, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Florida, most pollsters believe he still poses a greater threat to the Democrat. The Democrats certainly think so. More than 75 former Nader's Raiders published an open letter: \"As the recipient of financial and political support from rightwing campaign donors, Ralph is party to a disingenuous effort to split the progressive vote in key states. With the major party candidates in a dead heat, Nader is poised to tip the election to Bush - again.\" </p> <p>The ex-raiders will be using phones and chatrooms to convince likeminded Americans to switch their votes. </p> <p>Yet Mr Nader soldiers on, yesterday kicking off a tour of a dozen states with a trip to Florida. His sheer determination is a testament to his single-mindedness. He has never married, and has few interests other than political reform. </p> <p>It was bred in the bone. His father, Nathra, a Lebanese immigrant, ran a restaurant in Winsted, Connecticut, where his forthright political views were served up along with the food. </p> <p>Around the dinner table, the young Ralph was called on to explain and defend his beliefs. \"I spent countless nights around that table eating wonderful Arabic food, and talking to his father and mother,\" Mr Moffett, a fellow Lebanese-American recalls. \"They were very principled people, very idealistic people, but they were also out there. They were not interested in marginal victories, only the absolute will do.\" </p> <p>The young Ralph hated working in a small Connecticut law firm. Restless, he spent his summers hitchhiking across the country talking to truckers and travelling salesmen. What struck him was how dangerous their work was. Their vehicles were death-traps. Getting a job as a congressional aide in the early 1960s, he researched the car industry and in 1965, produced Unsafe at Any Speed, an indictment of modern cars, particularly the Chevrolet Corsair. </p> <p>For years it was Ralph Nader against General Motors, who went so far as to hire private detectives to discredit him. They sent a prostitute to try to seduce him at a food counter at Safeway's but he turned her away. So the gumshoes tried to prove he was homosexual but were caught as they tried to follow him into Congress. The scandal made Mr Nader into a hero overnight. The car makers were forced to introduce seat belts, and ultimately air bags. </p> <p>In the 1970s, Mr Nader toured the country again, this time urging students to set up public interest research groups for consumer and environmental reform. Ken Ward was a Massachusetts student in 1976. \"He was talking to people afterwards, and there was a professor talking about this method of turning cow manure into methane, and using it for energy,\" Mr Ward said. \"And we got into a car and drove out in the middle of nowhere to go look at cow manure, at 1.30 in the morning. Most college speakers and politicians don't do that.\" Mr Ward became a follower and has spent his career as a consumer activist. Like so many other Raiders, he has joined the stop-Ralph effort. </p> <p>\"In his own mind, he thinks the risk of four more years of George W Bush is worth it to him. But how does that work, if by every single indicator it's done nothing?\" </p> <p>Some critics put his perseverance down to sheer ego. But an egoist would be unnerved by the rising chorus of denigration. Mr Nader's certainty is so strong that defeat only reinforces it. </p> <p>\"We lose to win, eventually,\" he told the New York Times. \"That's the story of social justice. You have to be willing to lose and fight, and lose and fight, and lose and fight. Until the agenda is won.\" </p> <p>However, former supporters see only a stubborn old man running on pride. </p> <p>\"It's the whole St Ralph syndrome. He's pure, and we're all corrupt. </p> <p>\"He's just out there somewhere where it can't be reached,\" Mr Moffett said. \"He's afraid something might be won in a marginal way. He's only for overwhelming victory.\" </p> <p><br><b> Born </b><br> February 27 1934, in Winsted, Connecticut, to Lebanese immigrants, Nathra and Rose Nader </p> <p><b> Education</b> <br>Graduated from Princeton in 1955 and Harvard law school in 1958.

  "<b>The present</b> <p> For me, though, the big question is why even those governments which have recognised that Britain cannot escape its European destiny - including, as I have said, the present one - always seem over time to retreat from their initial resolve. Think of John Major's \"Heart of Europe\" speech back in 1991, or Tony Blair's frequent promises to end once and for all the ambivalence and ambiguities that haunt our dealings with other European nations. Why is it that the French can be comfortable with being French and European while we still see a choice between the two? For as long as we define Britishness in opposition to Europeanism, we are doomed.</p> <p>I don't doubt the good intentions of the prime minister. He is more comfortable in his European skin than any of his predecessors since Edward Heath. He also has a huge majority in the House of Commons. So why have good intentions once again given way to political expediency? </p> <p>Iraq provides part of the explanation. But even before Mr Blair chose to stand alongside George W Bush there was ample evidence of the familiar backsliding.</p> <p>One reason - and here I am more sympathetic to pro-European politicians - is that there has rarely been a bipartisan consensus in Britain. In most other member states, the Union is woven into the political fabric. But if we look back on 30 years of Britain's membership there has been only one brief period - for two or three years after the referendum in 1975 - when both of the two largest parties have broadly agreed on Europe. </p> <p>By 1983 the Labour party, which had advocated a Yes vote in 1975, was calling for complete withdrawal from the Community. And by the time Neil Kinnock - with a little help from Jacques Delors - had persuaded his party that Europe was not a capitalist ramp, Margaret Thatcher had set the Conservatives on to their present trajectory. Mr Major's good intentions did not survive the Maastricht Treaty. </p> <p>Earlier this month I listened in despair as Michael Howard gave a speech at the Conservative party conference as hostile to the European Union as any I have heard. </p> <p>The great irony is that the Conservatives' journey along the road of Euroscepticism has coincided with a profound shift in the nature of the European Union. The Monnet vision has dimmed. </p> <p>Looking back we can see that the Maastricht Treaty represented the high water mark of federalist ambition. There has been nothing since comparable to the Single European Act negotiated by Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>Enlargement to a Union of 25 has changed irreversibly the political geography of the Union. The Franco-German alliance is no longer sufficient to drive greater integration. And for all the faux alarmism of its opponents, the constitutional treaty codifies and entrenches the balance between the acquis communitaire and the intergovernmentalism promoted by Britain.</p> <p>Yet for as long as the European Union remains a political battleground at Westminster, the Europhobic press and that part of our political establishment and public opinion still trapped in the past has a powerful lever against pro-European governments such as that of Mr Blair. Mr Murdoch's influence on the present government - and it is painfully large - depends on the absence of bipartisan consensus.</p> <p>This though provides only part of the explanation of our reluctant Europeanism. Pro-Europeans need to admit a bigger failure, one that they will have to confront head on if the referendum on the constitutional treaty is to be won. The failure is to describe and explain Europe as it is - to admit that membership of this particular club does involve a diminution of what has been classically understood as national sovereignty and to persuade people that Britain is more prosperous and secure as a consequence. To borrow a phrase, the price is worth paying. </p> <p>From the very beginning those who march under a European flag have been less than honest about the nature of the bargain struck with our European neighbours and of the implications for national sovereignty. Thus the 1971 White Paper on entry declared:</p> <p>\"There is no question of any erosion of essential national sovereignty; what is proposed is a sharing and enlargement of individual national sovereignties in the general interest.\"</p> <p>A Sophist, or for that matter a Jesuit, could defend that particular linguistic construction. But to my mind it dodges a central reality. It represents the failure of nerve which lies at the very core of Britain's reluctant Europeanism. </p> <p> Sovereignty is the truly neuralgic word in this debate. </p> <p>It carries the implication - never properly challenged by pro-Europeans - that Britain does have a clear choice: it can opt for complete freedom of action outside the European Union or surrender its independence to Brussels. Sovereignty, in this mindset, is indivisible. Once passed to Brussels, it is lost to Britain. The debate about our relationship is thus held on ground chosen by Eurosceptics - the Union, they say, is a zero sum game; the only question is whether Britain emerges a winner or loser from the all-night bargaining sessions in Brussels. And more often than not, the sceptics will always claim, it is a loser.</p> <p>Never mind that this argument has long defied the realities of the modern world; that for a medium-sized nation on the edge of Europe, the option of independent action is a mirage. As Michael Heseltine once put it:</p> <p>\"A man alone in the desert is sovereign. He is also powerless.\" </p> <p>The same is true of governments. To consider almost any of the prime responsibilities of government - to provide security and freedom for the citizen, an economic framework in which people can prosper and a safety net for the disadvantaged - is to understand the interdependence that comes with globalisation. </p> <p>Think of the direct impact on Britain of the war in the Balkans, of war and famine in Somalia, of the backing for terrorism of the Taliban in Afghanistan. I keep hearing politicians of all parties insist that Britain will never cede immigration controls to Europe. But we all know, in a nation that has 90 million visitors every year, that control is illusory. It is no accident that the present government finally began to get a grip on the flow of asylum seekers into Britain only when France agreed to close the Sangatte camp outside Calais.</p> <p>To be fair, I have heard Mr Blair make this point about sovereignty - sometimes eloquently so. Thus in 2001 he told the European Research Institute in Birmingham:</p> <p>\"I see sovereignty not merely as the ability of a single country to say No, but as the power to maximise our national strength and capacity in business, trade, foreign policy, defence and the fight against crime. Sovereignty has to be deployed for national advantage. When we isolated ourselves in the past, we squandered our sovereignty - leaving us sole masters of a shrinking sphere of influence.\"</p> <p>My quarrel with the government lies in the distance between such analysis and day-to-day practice. Ministers all too often behave otherwise. Consider the monthly meetings of the Ecofin council of finance ministers. Before each such gathering the Treasury plants in the national press some story or other about how the chancellor is travelling to Brussels to tell his colleagues what's what, to veto this or that new directive, or to explain why Britain's economic policy is infinitely superior to that of other European governments. </p> <p>The temptation is to dismiss such behaviour as just silly - the Treasury at its puerile worst. But, month by month, it returns the argument about the EU to the Eurosceptics' chosen ground, feeding the delusion that Brussels is a plot against our national interest.</p> <p>So too does the language of \"red lines\" used by the government in the negotiations on the constitutional treaty. It is self-evident that every EU government set in advance its own demands and limits in the negotiations. France, for example, has long rejected the European superstate of the sceptics' nightmares. Yet Britain alone feels obliged to frame such bargaining in terms of lines beyond which it will never retreat instead of ground on which it would like to advance. Most of the European press described the outcome of the negotiations on the treaty as a triumph for the British vision of a Europe of nation states. But the government's own choice of language had already determined that the outcome would be seen at home as at best a limited defeat.</p> <p>This perception of Europe as a battleground seeps into the media. The other day the BBC announced a review of its European coverage. It intends to focus particularly on whether it gives due airtime to the Eurosceptics. I have no objection to such an analysis. But measuring how many minutes John Redwood gets to refute Kenneth Clarke seems to me to miss the point. </p> <p>The problem with the BBC's coverage - and, to be fair, that of much of the rest of the media - is that it too reports Europe in terms of them and us, of winning and losing. Rarely does the reporting acknowledge the deeper truth - that we cannot alone control our destiny and that, as Europeans, we can all benefit from shared decision-making.</p> <p>It seems to me that unless and until Britain's pro-Europeans take the sovereignty issue head on - until they explain that Britain cannot shape its own destiny alone and that the sovereignty so beloved of the Sun is a dangerous delusion - it will never be able to properly make the case for European engagement. That means too admitting that the EU is far from perfect - that sometimes the compromises are painful. The point is that, overall, the balance sheet is unequivocally positive. </p> <p><b>The future we cannot avoid </b></p> <p>The future, as Hugo said, is unavoidable.</p> <p>In a week or so the 25 members of the European Union are to put their signature to a new treaty of Rome. This time Britain will be there. But hardly with enthusiasm. When we look around the world everything tells us that we need more Europe rather than less if Britain's national interests are to be advanced. It has always struck me as ironic that the global economic liberalism that Conservatives have espoused since the 1980s has greatly strengthened the case for the political cooperation they abhor. </p> <p>No one can imagine after the events of 11 September 2001 that we are masters of our own security in the face of the threat from al-Qaida terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; few can believe that we can control immigration and asylum flows without the cooperation of our European partners; nor tackle cross-border crime without more coordination between police and judicial authorities across the continent. </p> <p>Climate change reminds us that the environment has no respect for national borders. We need the European Union to promote further liberalisation of world trade to the mutual advantage of poor and rich nations. Alone, Britain would never be heard in the Doha round of trade negotiations; the Union is listened to attentively. </p> <p> As Peter Mandelson has recently said, the emergence of China and India as great economic powers demands more rather than less coherence in Europe if the continent's interests are to be protected.</p> <p>Consider too the competition for energy as demand increases for the world's fossil fuel supplies. Those resources are concentrated in the Gulf, Russia and West Africa and our relationship with those regions will be critical for our future energy security. Britain - or for that matter any other single European country - cannot manage those relationships alone.</p> <p>Interdependence has long been a fact of life. It will become more rather than less so in the coming decades.</p> <p>The painful paradox facing Mr Blair is that he started out in 10 Downing Street determined to rebuild Britain's relations with Europe and has ended up as a prime minister more committed to a special relationship with Washington than any but Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>A vital lesson of the Iraq war should be that we need Europe in order to have a balanced relationship with Washington - an alliance, as Mr Blair has said, based on partnership rather than subservience. I do not doubt that Mr Bush has genuinely appreciated Mr Blair's support. And I have heard senior American officials say that we British have tended to underestimate the influence the prime minister has exercised in the White House. But we should not delude ourselves that the American approach to the relationship with the UK is anything but ruthlessly utilitarianism. US foreign policy has never left room for sentimentalism. </p> <p>And looking at Mr Bush's handling of the most pressing security issues of our times - the rising insurgency in Iraq, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Iran's nuclear ambitions among them - I would be surprised if Mr Blair would claim much of the credit for present US policy. </p> <p>I do not count myself among those who believe that we in Britain have to make an existential choice between the US and Europe - that to be full participating members of the European Union demands that we make enemies of our friends in Washington. </p> <p>Rather, I agree with the prime minister that Britain's economic and security interests lie in an Atlanticist European Union. And looking around the European Union of 25 we can see plenty of others who share that basic ambition - Germany and Italy as well as the former communist states of central and eastern Europe. I also share some of Mr Blair's doubts about Jacques Chirac's multi-polar world. Is French obsequiousness in Beijing so obviously preferable to British deference in Washington? The transatlantic community of values is sometimes exaggerated, but I fail to see how a Europe detached from America could feel more secure. </p> <p>For all that, our reflexes need to be as European as they are American - Britain cannot continue to define its ambitions in Europe in terms of what is acceptable in Washington. </p> <p>Gerhard Schr&amp;oumlder is right when he says the traffic on Mr Blair's bridge is too often one way. The government takes America's views to the capitals of Europe. It should more often take Europe's views to Washington.</p> <p>Another paradox. The future of Britain's place in Europe is now enmeshed in the outcome of the US presidential election on November 2. The conventional wisdom is that a victory for George Bush would be politically the most comfortable for Mr Blair. In fact, the prime minister needs John Kerry to win. A Democratic White House would give Mr Blair an opportunity to rebalance Britain's twin relationships with Europe and the US. The transatlantic alliance cannot now be resurrected in its postwar form. The collapse of communism dissolved the glue long provided by the Soviet threat. Europe is no longer at the centre of America's geopolitical interests; and the American guarantee is no longer the sine qua non of European security. But a Kerry presidency would provide the opportunity for, if not the certainty of, a new relationship between the US and Europe. Britain's strategic interests still lie firmly in the re-establishment of a cohesive alliance, in the rebuilding at both ends of Mr Blair's bridge across the Atlantic.</p> <p>That in turn also requires that the government wins the referendum on the proposed constitutional treaty.</p> <p>So can the British people be convinced? Here, I am at once pessimistic and optimistic.</p> <p>Pessimistic because, like everyone else, I read the opinion polls. </p> <p>And because, for all the fanfare of the prime minister's statement to the House of Commons last April, I see no evidence that the government is mobilising the Yes vote. The word from Downing Street is that nothing serious is to be said about the referendum until after the general election - Mr Murdoch's malevolent influence again. Mr Blair promises then to work his persuasive magic. He might have learned by now that the magic has faded. Even, as I suspect it will be, if the referendum is delayed until mid-2006, the campaign to win it must start now. Instead, the government leaves its pro-European case to speeches delivered by Dennis MacShane on the occasional wet night in Dudley. </p> <p>Yet I am optimistic because in spite of the message of the opinion polls, I suspect that the British electorate has more common sense on this issue than we give it credit for. Look beyond the saloon bar xenophobia of UKIP and most people do not find it that difficult to reconcile their Britishness with the idea that we are part of a larger construct. England's national football team is managed by a Swede, its most successful premiership club by a Frenchman. Where are the demonstrations on the streets against German ownership of Rolls Royce or a Spanish takeover of one of our biggest banks? </p> <p>If the referendum is framed, as it must be, in terms of a choice between continued active involvement in the EU and isolation on the margins of an organisation that nonetheless shapes our future, most voters may well conclude, as they did in 1975, that their heads should rule their hearts. The message that the Yes camp must convey - and it has the virtue of being the honest one - is that the status quo option in the referendum is to ratify the treaty. </p> <p> The British do not want to be isolated. </p> <p>Only the other day William Hague recalled that during the 2001 election campaign he had invited the voters to follow him in saving Britain from the European dragon. In Mr Hague's own candid admission: \"No one came\". </p> <p>That says to me that British pragmatism is alive and well; that, for all that some would like to think that our island status gives us a unique freedom of action, we know that the reality is otherwise.</p> <p>Lord Palmerston famously remarked that Britain did not have allies, only interests. The facts of the modern world are such that interests can only be pursued through alliances.</p> <p>As Hugo so eloquently reminded us, we may be unable to forget the past, but nor can we avoid the future.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>",

  "<p>The Kremlin, 1922. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, creator of the Soviet Union, murderer of the Romanovs, wielder of the power of life and death, is waiting impatiently.

  "Two thieves who tricked their way into the home of the actor Sylvia Syms and stole \u00a3300 were each jailed for 15 months yesterday. <p>Anna Al-Najashi and her cousin, Kamilla Szymanska, both from Poland, had been in the country for just 48 hours when they stole from the star of such films as Ice Cold in Alex. </p> <p>They told the 68-year-old actor their pet cat had found its way into her back garden. Ms Syms was taken in by their story and as she went to fetch a ladder, Najashi, 34, and Szymanska, 21, rifled her handbag and stole both her purse and the cash. </p> <p>Blackfriars crown court in London heard that a \"very angry\" Ms Syms realised what had happened and went looking for them in her car. </p> <p>She spotted the women almost immediately, only to lose them. She then called police and gave them a detailed description of the thieves. The two women were found in a nearby hotel, where they had already divided up the cash. Ms Syms' purse was found in their room. </p> <p>Najashi, a mother of four, and Szymanska, who has one child, both pleaded guilty to one count of burgling Ms Syms's home in Kensington, west London, on August 20. </p> <p>Judge Alan Hichin rejected defence pleas to spare them prison terms. \"I put this down to greed,\" he told them. \"You came here, in your case Al-Najashi to do some shopping, and in yours Szymanska to collect a debt from a friend of \u00a31,000.\" </p> <p>But 24 hours later they apparently fell under the influence of a fellow countryman, known only as Tobias. </p> <p>\"I'm told that despite your good character and maturity you agreed with his suggestion to burgle a property. </p> <p>\"You are not professionals, although you were in contact with one and I am quite satisfied you were not targeting the particular victim, either as a well-known actress, a 68-year-old, or somebody living alone. </p> <p>\"There was no violence, no damage, no threats in any way. </p> <p>\"You distracted her, and then got hold of her purse and the \u00a3300 and left ... you divided it between you, which shows Tobias was not going to profit out of this.\" </p> <p>The judge added: \"The victim was obviously angry at having been deceived and at having been caught off guard when perhaps she might have thought, as a professional actress, she would have spotted two other actresses.\"</p>",
  "Socialist MEPs bluntly told the incoming European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso yesterday to give Rocco Buttiglione, his choice as justice and home affairs commissioner, another post, and rejig the jobs of three other commissioners. <p>At an angry two-hour meeting the 200-strong group rejected the compromise offered by their leader, Martin Schulz, who had privately indicated that they would accept his whole team if Mr Barroso removed Mr Buttiglione's civil liberties duties. </p> <p>Mr Buttiglione, an Italian Catholic, who is rumoured to be about to resign his nomination, has enraged MEPs across the political spectrum by his outright hostility towards gay, women's rights and asylum seekers. </p> <p>Mr Schulz, who with other parliamentary leaders will meet Mr Barroso today, said his \"unanimous mandate\" was to demand a complete change of portfolio for Mr Buttiglione. </p> <p>That attitude is shared by most of the 88 liberal MEPs, who have told their leader, Graham Watson, not to accept a compromise </p> <p>Chris Davies, leader of the Liberal Democrat MEPs, said: \"Mr Barroso started off on the wrong foot and should have made early concessions rather than stand fully behind Buttiglione.\" </p> <p>Liberals suspect that Mr Barroso will offer piecemeal concessions to try to save Mr Buttiglione. </p> <p>The Greens went further, criticising six other commissioners and demanding that in future parliament should have the right to approve each commissioner individually rather than, as at present, having to endorse or reject the entire commission. </p> <p>Mr Barroso said in Berlin that he hoped for a \"balanced solution\", adding: \"The last thing we need in Europe at this very crucial moment is any kind of crisis.\"</p>",
  "<p>THE CLUB OF HARD KNOCKS</p> <p>It was tikka-toupeed troubadour Elton John who famously sang that \"sorry is the hardest word\". However the Fiver, with its Hattersleyesque lisp, always had more problems with Sussudio and Mississippi. And saying sorry certainly hasn't proved too difficult for Craig Bellamy, for he today apologised for calling Graeme Souness a \"f****** p****\" after being substituted against Charlton.</p> <p>\"I was out of order for what I did on Sunday and I want to apologise to the manager,\" the Newcastle striker admitted. \"I knew within 10 seconds what I did was wrong and I have tried to say so, but really I haven't had the chance because of other things that have happened.\" Like Souness giving him a bunch of fives on Tuesday, he might have added (but didn't).</p> <p>Souness's response? A blunt: \"Sometimes people get bashed up and you have to deal with it\". Er, yes... The Fiver, being a mung-bean munching, Guardian peacenik, wouldn't dare argue (we want to see our kids grow up, after all) - but Souness's primitive approach certainly seems to have worked. \"I want to give everything I can for the club, the fans and the manager,\" Bellamy sobbed. \"There are two routes I can go down and I know which one I will be taking.\" For the sake of his kneecaps, we hope he chooses wisely.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"This is the problem with all these d***heads who earn lots of money and believe they can do anything.

Twenty years later, faced with a choice between Tyne Asylum and a flick through Prince/Symbol/TAFKAP/The Artist/ Prince-again-actually's guide to reinvention, Paul's decided the only way out of his failed comeback is to cultivate a crop of facial hair so dainty it makes Julian Clary look butch, and change his name. To G8. No, really.</p> <p>Apparently TFFKAG wants to banish memories of the man who once ordered lunch at the Boro canteen wearing only his socks and belched into a microphone when asked to comment on a Lazio game. \"I need to get my reputation back, I need to get respect again,\" he said. As the Fiver concluded that third lager was indeed a mistake, he continued: \"I want people to see me and not think 'Great player, but remember Gazza.' Gazza's not here anymore.\" The disappearance will be achieved by cunningly combining his initial with his former shirt number. Yes, really.</p> <p>\"G8 is right for us now,\" he said, as onlookers waited for a) a punchline, b) a custard pie, or c) a new eight-piece boyband to appear in co-ordinated Armani. \"Paul's not right for us because it's too closely linked with the past,\" he added, chucking a pair of plastic bosoms on the fire and fielding calls from Geri Halliwell and Esther Ritchie. \"I like it, it sounds a bit like great, or it does with my Geordie accent,\" he chuckled.

  "For the last week, much of the good city of Liverpool has been baying for the blood of Boris Johnson. For those readers who have somehow managed to miss the tale of undiluted dimwittery, Johnson is the thatch-haired Conservative MP and editor of the Spectator magazine who saw fit to run a decidedly unpalatable leader column in the wake of Iraq hostage Ken Bigley's death, claiming that Liverpudlians were \"hooked on grief\", and throwing in some below-belt swipes at the Hillsborough tragedy for added piquancy. <p>Johnson's timing was far from impeccable - the northern dust (it comes from t'pit, don't you know) was still settling following the case of Sue Nelson, assistant chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy who last week rather rudely labelled the town of Wigan \"the arse-end of the world\". The Manchester Evening News valiantly bit back with a list of \"10 things to make any Wiganer proud\" including a collection of local delicacies: \"Pies, Heinz baked beans, Pataks Indian foods, Potters herbal remedies, Uncle Joe's Mint Balls and De Roma ice cream\", a diet which would surely achieve an arse-end the size of the world, were one to follow it with even remote dedication. Still, by the end of the week, it was impossible not to conclude that the north has something of an image problem.</p> <p>Thankfully, the town of Bolton has rallied to the rescue with a dazzling array of promotional postcards to be distributed in cafeterias and hotel lobbies throughout the region. It is, we learn, part of the \"Think you know Bolton? Think again...\" campaign, aimed at revitalising the image of the town, now best known as the home of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights. Not to be out-trumped, Manchester has hired Peter Saville - the \"design guru\", as I believe he is known - to rebrand the entire city.</p> <p>Saville, you may recall, made his name designing album covers for the likes of New Order and Joy Division, and was co-founder of Factory Records. The council challenged him with devising a way of marketing the city last March, and this month he revealed his campaign slogan, \"original-modern\". Manchester, argued Saville, was the birthplace of the industrial revolution and was, therefore, \"the original modern city\". His belief, he explained, was that the city should continue to be defined by those characteristics of being both \"original\" and \"modern\". Do you see?</p> <p>_______________________________________________</p> <p> But the zaniness does not end there. Oh no. Step forward award-winning architect Will Alsop, whose plans for a \"SuperCity\" of the north stretching from Liverpool to Hull are due to be exhibited at Urbis in January. Alsop's designs would turn the entire M62 corridor into a throbbing metropolis, apparently. \"It may seem radical\", Scott Burnham, creative director of Urbis, conceded to the Manchester Metro News, \"but with people travelling as much as they do it is not hard to envisage a situation where you may work in Manchester, live in Halifax, and spend an evening out at a nightclub in Liverpool.\" Except that you wouldn't have a hope of catching Corrie at 7.30pm should you embark on such an expedition - would you now, Scott? </p> <p>Anyway, Manchester saw two new arrivals this week: firstly, the world's largest transportable wheel, which arrived from Paris for a four-month sojourn in the city. The wheel, which weighs 365 tonnes and features 51,000 lightbulbs, will reside in Exchange Square, offering unrivalled views of the Arndale Centre. Meanwhile, over in Albert Square, the city's Christmas tree has been hoiked up outside the Town Hall 66 days before the big day itself. Well, you wouldn't wish to get caught short, would you? The tree, you may recall, is not a tree at all, but a 50ft high artificial conifer, seemingly hailing from the John Wyndham school of horticulture. The council assured the Manchester Evening News that, though the tree is up, the lights won't be switched on until November 12. So try to ignore the giant green cone until then, please. </p> <p>_______________________________________________</p> <p>Across the Pennines, rats are running amok in the sewers of Yorkshire. According to the Yorkshire Post, Hull officials are levelling the blame at Yorkshire Water, which they say have failed to fulfil their responsibility to bait the rodents. Research by Hull Council has shown that since Yorkshire Water employed private contractors rather than the council to deal with the rat population, rodent numbers in Richmondshire, York, Doncaster and Sheffield as well as Hull have increased year-on-year. The council suggests that frequent change in contractor and half-hearted baiting measures are principally to blame for the swell in population.</p> <p>\"The method of hanging poison in plastic bags on string down the manholes is not very effective and is inflicting far fewer casualties on the rats than the former methods of its own staff,\" reported the Post. The Pied Piper was not available for comment.</p> <p>_______________________________________________ </p> <p>In Newcastle, there was understandable excitement at the news that offshore wind power industry will generate some 38,000 jobs in the region over the next 15 years. The announcement by the Department of Trade and Industry and Greenpeace came hot on the heels of less heartening employment figures, which showed the number of those claiming unemployment benefits to be 7,000 up on last month.</p> <p>The job surge depends on offshore wind power providing 30% of the UK's energy by 2020. At present, renewable energy accounts for a mere 3% of the total electricity supply, of which 15% comes from wind energy. But the region was hopeful that the jobs would actually materialise - the country's first offshore wind farm was, after all, at Blyth. Doug Everard, chief executive of the New and Renewable Energy Resources Centre in Blyth said the job figures were achievable. After all, he explained to the Chronicle, \"a typical wind farm will be 100 megawatts, 30 times the size of the one in Blyth.\"</p> <p>There was optimism in Merseyside too, following the announcement that a new six-speed gearbox for Ford is to be built at a plant in Halewood, securing over 600 jobs, and hopefully generating hundreds more. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Boris.</p> <p>_______________________________________________</p> <p> Finally, we bring you a Pendolino update: though we have heard rumours that one of Virgin's new high-speed tilty trains succeeded in arriving some 10 minutes early last week, our own experience has found two out of three trains between London and Manchester to be decidedly tardy.

  "Even after all, they went with barely a whimper. Last week the radical Islamist organisation al-Muhajiroun announced it was shutting down after eight years and countless tabloid inches. This was the group that brought us \"celebrations\" for the anniversary of September 11, and visions of \"the black flag of Islam\" flying over No 10. <p>Announcing the end on the group's website, Muhajiroun's leader Omar Bakri said it was important for Muslims to unite, since \"evil forces\" had united against Islam. Bakri has been a divisive figure for so long, it is hard to believe his call was sincere. It is more likely he simply saw a closing net - the arrest of his fellow rhetorician Abu Hamza, this week charged with 16 domestic offences, and the increased spotlight on him - and decided to quit. </p> <p>The end of the \"Muj\" is hardly an occasion for mourning. They were a fringe group, with perhaps 500 members. But, to the exasperation of community leaders, they were often held up as a representative. </p> <p>The increasingly wild comments of Omar Bakri - he was reported to have said the Beslan children were legitimate targets - were seized on by those who want to justify their caricature of Muslims as an enemy within. It was a symbiotic relationship, and neither side cared; not Bakri, who knows he cannot be deported, nor the press, who had found their demagogue. Those who did care were those young Muslims on the sharp end of Islamaphobia. To many of them, the Muj looked like the only people speaking their language. </p> <p>The most recent census highlighted how the Muslim community is being squeezed socially: the highest rate of unemployment, the poorest health, the fewest qualifications. At the same time, Muslims are being squeezed intellectually, denied the space to make their voices heard. There is often a call for Muslim moderates to speak louder. But who, apart from Bakri and Abu Hamza, are given such huge platforms to speak from? When Tariq Ramadan, one of Europe's foremost Muslim thinkers, had his visa revoked by the US this summer, there was scarcely a public murmur, whereas the thoughts of an unemployed \"sheikh\" from north London warrant a response from the home secretary. </p> <p>Young Muslim men in deprived urban areas feel that squeeze most strongly, and it is from among them that the Muj drew its support. The more our public discourse fails to reflect the many views within the Muslim community, the more likely it is some people will turn to groups such as the Muj. </p> <p>The end of Muhajiroun will not mean that, suddenly, hordes of radicals, released from the leash of Bakri, will wreak havoc. That is a fantasy, and invites the criminalisation of an entire section of the community. (It also gives Muj members a romantic power: \"We have many loose cannons on the street,\" huffed a Muj leader last week. \"And I am sure you will be hearing from them soon.\") </p> <p>Rather, most members will re-join that growing body of young people who don't feel their contribution to society is respected. The Muslim community has far better spokesmen and women than Omar Bakri; if they were allowed to speak, young Muslims would have the opportunity to listen. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:f.alyafai@theguardian.com\">f.alyafai@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The world's second-biggest spirits group, Allied Domecq, today reported a 6% rise in annual profits, boosted by a change in US tastes from beers to spirits.</p> <p>The company's pre-tax profits increased from \u00a3491m to \u00a3521m, in line with analysts' forecasts, and it said the rise had been driven by a growth of core brands such as Courvoisier cognac and Beefeater gin. </p> <p>Profits at Allied's Quick Service Restaurants, which include Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins ice cream parlours, surged by 21%. Many analysts see the division as an area for potential divestment.</p> <p>\"Our core brands performed well in the United States, delivering overall market share gains,\" the chief executive, Philip Bowman, said. \"Overall, these good performances have more than offset the trading challenges we faced in markets such as South Korea, France and Germany.\"</p> <p>With the Atkins diet still proving popular, drinkers in the US are increasingly shunning carbohydrate-heavy beer and instead turning to spirits and cocktails. Allied said volumes of core spirits brands had risen by 8% during the year, adding that it expected to see continued earnings growth next year.</p> <p>Malibu rum volumes grew by 31% in north America, boosted by new mango and pineapple flavours, while Stolichnaya vodka volumes rose by 9% and Sauza tequila volumes were up 13%.</p> <p>However, Courvoisier volumes fell 2% in north America against a tough comparison with last year, when cognacs had enjoyed a boost as the drink of choice for rappers such as Snoop Dogg. Despite the US slump, Mr Bowman said Courvoisier had seen growth of 9% in the UK.</p> <p>Slowing consumer spending in South Korea dented volumes of Allied's Imperial whisky by 22%, the group said. The finance director, Graham Hetherington, said France and Germany remained challenging markets, adding that the group would have to adjust its brands and cost base to cope.</p> <p>\"The solution is finding markets that are growing faster than Germany and France, and that's what we're doing in eastern Europe and China,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Hetherington said that, in the absence of suitable acquisitions, Allied would look to return cash to shareholders as debt was reduced - although this was unlikely to happen before late next year.</p> <p>Allied, which also makes Canadian Club whisky and Tia Maria liqueur, said it was increasing the full-year dividend by 11% to 15.5p. </p> <p>Its shares have outperformed the FTSE-100 by 10% this year, and those of Diageo - the world market leader - by 13%. Last week, they hit a record 504p, although today they had fallen 4.25p to 486.75p by 12.25pm.</p>",

This has nothing to do with the American elections. It has everything, however, to do with the Iraqi elections in January.\" </p> <p>The Tory leader, Michael Howard, said the opposition would not push for a parliamentary vote on any such deployment. But the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said his party would oppose any deployment which did not come at the request of British commanders on the ground. </p> <p>Mr Blair said the request was being assessed \"in the normal way\". He added: \"It is a military request, for operational reasons, and it will be considered on an operational basis.\" </p> <p>The prime minister told the Commons: \"There are some 650 troops involved. I cannot say exactly where in Iraq they are going. But I can say that much of the speculation has been wholly ill-informed and they are not, for example, going to either Falluja or Baghdad.\" </p> <p><b>Scottish regiments cuts</b><br>The prime minister defended plans to cut the number of Scottish regiments at a time when they were involved in Iraq. He said changes were needed to ensure the armed forces could meet modern needs but appeared to hint that the Black Watch could yet be spared the axe. He told Liberal Democrat Sir Robert Smith the armed forces were reviewing the configuration of battalions and regiments. \"I would suggest that we await the outcome of that review because it may not be exactly as you think.\" </p> <p><b>Margaret Hassan held hostage</b><br> Mr Blair paid tribute to the kidnapped aid chief Margaret Hassan and said ministers were doing all they could to secure her release. He said the nation's thoughts were with her. \"She is immensely respected, married to an Iraqi and worked tirelessly to help the country.\" Mr Howard said his party's \"thoughts and prayers\" were with Mrs Hassan's family. </p> <p><b>Jaguar</b><br> The prime minister called for commitments from Ford about the future of Jaguar in Britain. Labour's Jim Cunningham said employees appreciated the government's intervention over the proposed closure of the Brown's Lane factory and asked: \"What progress has been made?\" Mr Blair said he had asked the company and unions to ensure proposals were subject to proper joint scrutiny. \"I also hope they will be able to give commitments about the long term future of Jaguar and indeed Ford in the country.\" </p> <p><b>Means-testing for pension credits</b><br>Means-testing is necessary to lift the poorest pensioners out of hardship, the prime minister insisted. Mr Blair told Tory Hugo Swire the pensioner credit was introduced to help the poorest pensioners, some of whom had been on \"appalling low incomes\". \"Two million pensioners have been lifted out of acute hardship as a result of the measures we have taken.\" </p> <p><b>Youth clubs and education</b><br>Mr Blair faced calls to scrap plans to force youth clubs to meet targets for educating young people. Tory Andrew Selous said: \"Young people work hard all week, often at weekends too. What they want is somewhere they can go to relax and have fun and not be forced to achieve a 'learning outcome' on a Friday or Saturday night.\" Mr Blair said investment in youth services was increasing, adding: \"The best learning outcome is whether they are actually learning the basics in schools\". </p> <p><b>Young offender institutions</b><br>Standards must be considered alongside cost in any moves to contract the running of youth offender institutions to the private sector, Mr Blair told MPs. He said: \"It's important, whatever happens, to make sure that the way that our prisons are run is obviously at its most cost effective but also that we do the best for the juveniles in these establishments.\" </p> <p><b>Apprenticeships</b><br>The prime minister told MPs that the number of apprenticeships would increase to 300,000 by the end of next year amid warnings of a serious skill shortage. He said: \"What is more, we are ensuring that the vocational pathways for 14-19 year olds are now put on parity of esteem with the academic route\". </p> <p><b>NHS dentist shortage</b><br>Tory Anthony Steen protested there were virtually no NHS dentists in south Devon. He suggested unspent funds committed to practices in his constituency be used for homeopathic dental services rather than \"awaiting the promised arrival of bus loads of Polish dentists\". Mr Blair said there were about 2,500 more dentists than in 1997 but more were needed. \"These will all be highly qualified people,\" he said. </p> <p><b>North-east referendum</b><br>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said he was confident the people of the north-east will vote \"yes\" in the referendum on whether to set up a regional assembly. Bernard Jenkin, for Tories, said the Federation of Small Businesses in the north-east has said it would rather money was spent on up-grading the A1 road than on a \"toothless talking shop\". </p> <p>Mr Prescott insisted a regional assembly would be cheaper, costing \u00a312m less than the current arrangements, with 600 fewer councillors and 10 fewer councils. \"More efficient, more effective and the people making their own decisions - that's why I'm quite convinced they'll vote Yes,\" he told MPs. </p> <p><b>Armed forces pensions bill</b><br>The government warned it would scrap its armed forces (pensions) bill, updating pensions and compensation, rather than allow Lords' changes. In what Tories described as a \"belligerent\" move, junior defence minister Ivor Caplin warned peers could not \"cherry pick\" bits of the old and proposed new compensation arrangements. </p> <p><b>US immigration service</b><br>Anger at unfair treatment of Britons at the hands of US immigration officials was expressed by MPs on both sides. They were also concerned at the lack of diplomatic redress over incidents involving shackling and deportation. They protested that the US was not honouring its obligations as an ally by entering into dialogue with British consular staff. However, Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane said protests from the British government had prompted a rule change on cases involving minor infringements of immigration law. </p> <p><b>Child health</b><br> The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, demanded \"a more interventionist approach\" to tackling child health problems. He said during debate on the government's National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity, that asthma, diabetes, alcohol and drugs misuse and poor sexual health were among \"many indicators of children's health that are not necessarily moving in the right direction\". </p> <p>Junior health minister Stephen Ladyman said the NSF involved a \"fundamental change in thinking around the needs of the child\" and had been described by experts as \"the biggest step forward for children for 50 years\". He added: \"It will raise standards in hospitals, GPs' surgeries, schools and nurseries, maternity units and Sure Start children's centres.\" </p> <p><b>Gaelic broadcasting</b><br>A Labour former Scottish minister Calum MacDonald condemned as \"indefensible\" the government's funding of Gaelic broadcasting. He said there was a unique opportunity to set up a dedicated digital television channel but the government appeared \"incapable of willing the means\" to fund such a venture. The culture minister Richard Caborn insisted the issue had been \"high on the political agenda\" and \u00a38.5m was a \"considerable sum of money\". </p> <p><b>English counties</b><br>England's historic county system \"is in the process of being destroyed\" and reforms are needed to preserve a \"vital\" piece of heritage, Tory Adrian Flook said. He told the house people viewed counties as sources of \"identity and affection\" but council changes meant traditional boundaries were being eroded. His historic counties (traffic signs and mapping) bill would see counties marked on Ordnance Survey maps and tourist signs placed on roads to alert people to original boundaries. It gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Customs and excise</b><br>Customs and Excise officers should be told to \"cease imposing their own personal ideas\" of how much drink and cigarettes for personal consumption can be brought home by travellers from abroad, Tory former chancellor Lord Lawson urged. He said: \"Tax law is very clear that anybody can bring unlimited quantities of cigarettes or booze into this country, provided it is for their own personal consumption.\" Lord McIntosh Haringey, for the government, spoke of \"many thousands of cigarettes which are claimed to be for personal use in a number of cases in which travellers have been stopped by customs and excise.\" </p> <p><b>In parliament today:</b><br>The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, and her ministers face the Commons at question time. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, opens a debate on defence in the world. The Lords debates the committee stages of the highways (obstruction by body corporate) bill and the civil contingencies bill and Commons amendments to the companies bill. </p>",
  "The Foreign Office is to protest to Turkey about the detention and expulsion of British citizens because of alleged \"discrepancies\" in their UK passports. <p>On at least two occasions this summer, Turkish immigration officials prevented travellers who had recorded their place of birth as \"Kurdistan\" from entering the country. No compensation was paid for their flights or ruined holidays. </p> <p>Turkey - which has enacted far-reaching human rights reforms as it attempts to join the EU - is fighting separatist guerrillas who are trying to establish an autonomous Kurdish state in the south-east of the country. </p> <p>Although Brussels has asked for specific progress in the area of Kurdish human rights, use of the term \"Kurdistan\" is still often officially disparaged in Turkey. </p> <p>There are as many as 25 million Kurds, living mainly in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. They are the largest stateless ethnic group in the Middle East; hundreds of thousands of them have fled to western Europe. </p> <p>The two incidents being investigated by British diplomats occurred at Istanbul airport. In one, a minor, thought to be travelling alone, was stopped by immigration officials on August 24, detained and then put on a plane back to Britain. </p> <p>His UK passport gave his place of birth as \"Kurdistan\". His mother and their MP have raised the case with the Foreign Office. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said yesterday: \"I understand that under Turkish law, [travellers] of any nationality can be deported if their passport has a discrepancy, and the word Kurdistan can be classed as a discrepancy. But it's not satisfactory for people to be turned round and sent back. We are writing to the Turkish foreign affairs ministry to express our concern at these incidents. </p> <p>\"We take it very seriously. We are seeking an explanation. Our consular office in Istanbul has also been in touch with Turkish immigration officials.\" </p> <p>The Foreign Office is also considering altering its travel advice for Turkey to warn those who come from the region and have been granted UK citizenship that they may encounter problems if they refer to \"Kurdistan\" in their passports. The Passport Office has also been alerted. </p> <p>The second case involves the Ibrahim family from Croydon, south London, who were held at Istanbul airport on August 28 before being put on a flight back to Britain. They are planning to sue the Turkish government. </p> <p>Suzan Ibrahim, 31, a lawyer, and her husband Honar, 38, a graphic designer, arrived at Istanbul with their one-year-old son and three-year-old daughter. The parents were born in Sulaimaniya in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. They were planning to travel through Turkey to visit friends and family still living there. </p> <p>\"We hold valid British passports,\" Mrs Ibrahim said. \"When we arrived at the airport the immigration officials saw that [we] had written Kurdistan as our place of birth in our passports. We wanted to recognise that we are from Kurdistan, and the British government obviously didn't have any problem with that. </p> <p>\"But the Turkish officials put us all in a room where the lights were left on all night. The children couldn't sleep. The officials humiliated us, saying racist things about Kurds. We lost our tickets as well, and the airline refused to give us a refund.\" </p> <p>The family eventually travelled to Iraq via Syria. </p> <p>The Turkish embassy in London yesterday said it was unaware of the incidents.</p>",
  "<b>British MPs vote for Kerry</b> <br> <p>British MPs from all parties would prefer John Kerry to be the next US president, according to a YouGov poll.

  "<p>This is the story of a lost world. A tale of mysterious creatures and thrilling exploration, of dreams, arguments and an international race for glory - all set against the stunning backdrop of Antarctica. But mostly, this is a story about drilling. The old joke from the Yellow Pages does not ring true in this case: for drilling do not see boring. </p> <p>It all began in 1989 when Russian scientists at a remote Antarctic research field station, in the centre of the mighty East Antarctic glacial plateau 1250km from the South Pole in one direction and 1260km from the coast in the other, started to drill a hole into the ice. The researchers knew exactly what they were looking for: trapped in the ice, which had steadily built up over hundreds of thousands of years, would be tiny bubbles of air that carried secrets of Earth's past climate. It worked, and the now famous Vostok (named after the station) ice core was the first to show a clear link between raised carbon dioxide levels and a warmer atmosphere over the past 400,000 years. </p> <p>But, as the scientists drilled, it became clear that something else was lurking under the ice. For years, Russian pilots in the area had noticed a strange flat region on the surface and as the drillers neared a depth of 4,000m, the ice they dragged back to the surface started to look very different. It was not snow squeezed from the surface through thousands of years of compaction, but refrozen water. Seismic surveys and satellite images confirmed the scientists' suspicions: lying directly underneath the Russian station, way down in the freezing depths, was a lake of fresh, liquid, water. </p> <p>Now called Lake Vostok, the scale of the underground reservoir stunned experts. Covering an area twice the size of Yorkshire, it is up to 1,200m deep. More intriguingly, its icy roof has probably sealed the lake from the rest of the planet for at least 15m years. With no sunlight and just traces of nutrients to provide energy, biologists quickly realised that if there is life in the lonely waters of Lake Vostok - and there is life everywhere else on Earth where there is fresh water - it might be very different from life on the rest of our planet. </p> <p>\"We really don't know what's down there,\" says Martin Siegert, a glaciologist and an expert in subglacial lakes at the University of Bristol. At its most far-reaching, life that evolved in the lake from the simple organisms that drained into it millions of years ago could show us what we might find in the watery depths predicted to lie beneath the icy crust of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons and the prime candidate for finding life on another world. </p> <p>The one thing the scientists could be sure of was that puncturing the lake's surface with a dirty Russian drill loaded with 60 tonnes of kerosene to stop it freezing was not a good idea. With the bottom of the borehole just 120m above the pristine lake's frozen surface, drilling operations at Vostok were suspended in 1998. </p> <p>Debate about what to do next has swung back and forwards ever since. Until now. At a meeting earlier this month in the German port of Bremerhaven, scientists from across the world finally hammered out a plan to explore Lake Vostok. Well, nearly. </p> <p>\"We want to get into Vostok eventually but we want to approach it very carefully,\" says Colin Summerhayes, director of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research in Cambridge, which oversees international efforts in Antarctica and has drawn up the new plan. \"We're going to try out our techniques and technology on some of the smaller lakes first.\" </p> <p>Vostok is the biggest and most famous lake underneath Antarctica, but not the only one. Some 145 have been identified so far, and more will follow. Formed by geothermal heat melting the base of the ice sheet, which then acts as an insulating blanket to stop the water refreezing, all the lakes are dark, isolated from the outside world and all pose the same problem to scientists who want to probe them for life: \"If we find life we have to be sure that it was there before and that we didn't put it there,\" says John Priscu, an ecologist at Montana State University who has studied lakes in Antarctica. Space scientists heading to search Mars and other worlds, Europa included, face the same problem. </p> <p>Subglacial lakes only stay liquid if their ice blanket is thicker than about 3,000m, which makes them awkward to access. But some are more awkward than others, and among the easiest to explore is Lake Ellsworth in West Antarctica, about 3,400 metres down. \"Lake Ellsworth is reasonably small so we can cut our teeth on that one and then move onto something bigger,\" Summerhayes says. </p> <p>Siegert is leading a British project, which includes scientists who worked on the ill-fated Beagle 2 mission to Mars, that aims to send a robot explorer into Lake Ellsworth within five years. </p> <p>\"It's very exciting from a British point of view,\" he says. \"We will actually be leading the way in subglacial lake exploration.\" His team wants \u00a32m to melt a hole down to the lake using hot water - through which a slimline robot fitted with lights and cameras will be lowered to analyse lake sediment, scan for life and retrieve water samples. </p> <p>If there is life in Lake Ellsworth, it is likely to be simple. \"It will be basic stuff like single-celled organisms, algae, some viruses and fungi - that kind of thing,\" Siegert says. Currently living under crushing pressure because of the weight of frozen water above, he says nothing would survive being brought to the lower-pressure surface: \"It will just get blown apart but we'll still be putting the bits and pieces back together to identify what it was.\" </p> <p>Under the Bremerhaven plan, if the British pull it off then next on the list would be an Italian-led expedition to the much larger Lake Concordia. Following that would be a similar body beneath the South Pole and then the jewel in the crown, Vostok itself. </p> <p>\"We want people to work on particular projects at particular times so there's more of a sequence than a mad gold-rush-style scramble with everyone doing their own thing,\" Summerhayes says. </p> <p>Still, not everybody wants to play ball and the Russian team insists it will enter Vostok much earlier. Valery Lukin of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St Petersburg says drilling in the original Vostok borehole could resume in January. \"I am a Russ ian and the first people I listen to are Russian scientists,\" he says. </p> <p>Within two or three years they want to puncture Vostok's seal, trusting in the lake's high pressure to drive water up the borehole and keep the less dense, contaminating drill fluids away. They will then wait for the water to refreeze, before redrilling, extracting and analysing it. \"Maybe this year we will drill 20m of new ice,\" Lukin says - though he is still waiting for the final go-ahead from his political masters. A decision is expected in the next two weeks. </p> <p>Other scientists are unhappy with the plan, but are powerless to act. \"I think it's going to be too risky for the science involved. It's going to be a contaminated mess,\" says Priscu at Montana. \"I don't like the idea. It seems we're going back to the Amundsen-Scott stuff and we don't need that. I don't think a nation has to be first any more.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scar.org/treaty/atcmxxvii/ip100subglaciallakes.pdf\">www.scar.org/treaty/atcmxxvii/ip100subglaciallakes.pdf</a> Briefing on the lakes from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/ellsworth/index.htm\">www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/ellsworth/index.htm</a>Details of UK proposal to explore Lake Ellsworth </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/research/glaciology/personalpp/siegert/pdf1.pdf\">www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/research/glaciology/personalpp/siegert/pdf1.pdf</a> Study of Antarctic subglacial lakes from geophysical and numerical modelling information </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aari.nw.ru/index_en.html\">www.aari.nw.ru/index_en.html</a> Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St Petersburg</p>",
  "The undisputed facts are these: it was broad daylight, 13-year-old Iman al-Hams was wearing her school uniform, and when she walked into the Israeli army's \"forbidden zone\" at the bottom of her street she was carrying her satchel. A few minutes later the short, slight child was pumped with bullets. Doctors counted at least 17 wounds and said much of her head was destroyed. <p>Beyond that there is little agreement between the army top brass and Palestinian witnesses as to how Iman came to die last week, or even among members of the military unit responsible for killing the child in Gaza's Rafah refugee camp. </p> <p>Palestinian witnesses described the shooting as cold-blooded. They say soldiers could not have failed to see they were firing at a child, and she was killed as she already lay wounded and helpless. </p> <p>\"Some soldiers were lying on the ground and shooting very heavily toward her,\" said Basim Breaka, who saw the killing from her living room. \"Then one of the soldiers walked to her and emptied his clip into her. For sure she died on the second or third bullet. I could see her lying on the ground, not moving. I can't imagine why that soldier wanted to shoot her after she was dead.\" </p> <p>This week an army investigation cleared the unit's commander after some of his own soldiers accused him of giving the order to shoot knowing the target was a young girl, and of then emptying the clip of his automatic rifle into her. </p> <p>On the day she died, Iman left home shortly before 7am for the short walk to school in Rafah's Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood. The school, facing the heavily militarised border with Egypt, is under the shadow of a towering camouflaged Israeli gunpost. </p> <p>Like almost every other building in the area, Iman's school is pockmarked by bullets. Last year, a 13-year-old boy was shot dead by the army outside the school. This year, two pupils and a teacher were wounded by bullets inside the grounds. </p> <p>Iman walked past her school with her satchel over her shoulder, crossed the road and climbed down a small sandy bank to an area that was an olive and citrus orchard until the army's bulldozers flattened it in April. She had entered the \"forbidden zone\" next to the watchtower where any Palestinian risks being shot. </p> <p>The schoolgirl kept on walking toward the tower but was still several hundred metres away when two shots caught her in the leg. She dropped her bag, turned, tried to hobble away, and fell. </p> <p>Four or five soldiers emerged from the army post and shot at her from a distance. Palestinian witnesses and some Israeli soldiers say that the platoon commander moved in closer to put two bullets in the child's head. They say that he then walked away, turned back and fired a stream of bullets into her body. </p> <p>Iman's corpse was taken to Rafah's hospital and inspected by Dr Mohammed al-Hams. \"She has at least 17 bullets in several parts of the body, all along the chest, hands, arms, legs,\" he said. \"The bullets were large and shot from a close distance. The most serious injuries were to her head. She had three bullets in the head. One bullet was shot from the right side of the face beside the ear. It had a big impact on the whole face. Another bullet went from the neck to the face and damaged the area under the mouth.\" </p> <p>The doctor said that the nature of the wounds suggested that Iman was already dead when some of the bullets hit her. The army swiftly blamed Iman for her own death by entering the forbidden zone. At first, the military said soldiers suspected the girl was carrying a bomb in her satchel. When it turned out there was no bomb, it said she was being used by Palestinian combatants to lure troops from their post. </p> <p>But some soldiers in the unit responsible, the Shaked battalion, were outraged at what they saw as a cover-up. One told Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that a soldier in the watchtower had told the company commander that he was about to shoot a child: \"Don't shoot, it's a little girl\". </p> <p>\"The company commander approached her, shot two bullets into her, walked back towards the force, turned back to her, switched his weapon to automatic and emptied his entire magazine into her. We were in shock. We couldn't believe what he was doing. Our hearts ached for her. Just a girl of 13,\" a soldier told the newspaper. </p> <p>Other soldiers said that if the company commander was not dismissed they would refuse to serve under him: \"It is a disgrace that he is still in his position. We want him kicked out.\" </p> <p>The accounts of Palestinian witnesses back the claims of the protesting soldiers. </p> <p>Fuad Zourob was working at a small brick factory overlooking the area where Iman was shot. \"The girl was walking in the sand. She was shot from the army post. She was hit in the leg and she was crawling. </p> <p>\"Then she stood up and started to try and run and then she fell. The shooting went on. The soldiers arrived by foot. One came close to the girl and started to shoot. He walked away, turned back and then shot her some more,\" he said. </p> <p>Yousef Breaka watched from the balcony of his second floor flat. He owns the 12 acres of bulldozed land beside the building which Iman crossed minutes before she was shot. </p> <p>\"The first shot came from the army post. It hit her in the leg. She was starting to walk on and then fell. She dropped her bag. They were firing, heavy shooting. I am sure she died before the two soldiers came and shot her bag and then her,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Breaka's living room wall is decorated with the holes of nine bullets fired from the Israeli army watchtower two years ago. A tenth bullet killed his 80-year-old mother, Jindiya. </p> <p>Neither Iman's father, Samir al-Hams, nor the witnesses know why the girl walked into the forbidden zone. </p> <p>\"I can't explain why she was there. I've asked everyone and no one can explain it. Perhaps she just wanted to walk on the sand. Perhaps she was confused. I don't know,\" said Mr al-Hams. </p> <p>Mr Zourob was surprised to see Iman walking at the back of his factory. \"I was astonished. I didn't know why she was there. No one goes toward that area. She was alone but some of the schoolchildren were calling her: Iman, why are you there?\" he said. </p> <p>The watchtower sits atop a large hill of sand. It is surrounded by barbed wire and other defences. Even before she was hit in the leg, it would have taken Iman 10 minutes or more to scramble up the hill. Once she was wounded, there was little chance she could have got to the watchtower. </p> <p>If she was carrying a bomb, it could have harmed Israeli troops had she got close enough to them. But after Iman was shot in the leg she dropped her school bag. </p> <p>Palestinian witnesses say soldiers pumped it full of bullets, establishing that it was not a bomb, but still went on to shoot the girl. </p> <p>The Israeli army's rules of engagement permit soldiers to wound a person who enters a security zone and does not heed warning shots to leave. But once the person is wounded, soldiers are only permitted to kill if there is an imminent threat to their lives. Witnesses say Iman was helpless and posed no such threat. </p> <p>Her father is a teacher at a primary school neighbouring his daughter's. \"The day Iman was killed, the headmistress of her school called me at 8.15 and asked why she wasn't at school. I said I had no idea.,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I ran to the school. The teachers and headmistress told me the army shot toward a small girl but she was fine, don't worry. I calmed down a bit when I heard that and thought maybe they shot toward her to make her afraid and arrested her for interrogation and they will release her. But then they declared her dead. That was the worst moment in my life.\" </p> <p>This week, the officer responsible for the Gaza strip, Major General Dan Harel, completed his investigation and pronounced that the company commander had not acted unethically in the shooting of Iman but was being suspended for losing the confidence of his soldiers. </p> <p>The speed of the investigation has revealed once again the cursory nature of the army's inquiries into such shootings. A more thorough investigation usually only follows if there is external pressure, such as in the case of three Britons shot dead by Israeli soldiers over the past two years. </p> <p>The military has quietly dropped an investigation into the killing by an Israeli sniper of a brother and sister, both teenagers, in Rafah in May. The army falsely claimed that the pair were killed by a Palestinian bomb and only began the investigation after journalists found the bodies of the children and reported that both had a single shot to the head. </p> <p>Under pressure from the revelations of the Shaked battalion soldiers, the military police has launched a separate investigation into the death of Iman al-Hams. The soldiers say they will insist that it is completed.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's golfers made it look easy to win on American soil when they carried home the Ryder Cup last month. Our racehorses may find the going rather more difficult on the dirt and turf of Lone Star Park in Texas on Saturday week, but while the travelling party for the 21st Breeders' Cup is one of the smallest in recent years, its spread seems likely to be unexpectedly wide. </p> <p>After the entries were revealed for the eight Breeders' Cup races at a press conference at Epsom yesterday, a total of 12 runners from Europe seems likely to compete in Dallas, two less than made the longer trip to Santa Anita in California last year. However, the visitors seem likely to be represented in no fewer than six of the events, including three of the contests that take place on dirt. </p> <p>Much of the burden of upholding European honour will fall on France and Ireland, as Great Britain will send only two competitors. One of those, however, is Ouija Board, the winner of both the English and Irish Oaks this year. Her connections will not decide until next Wednesday whether to run her in the Turf event over 12 furlongs, which was nominated as her first preference yesterday, or the Filly &amp; Mare Turf over 11, for which she would probably start favourite. </p> <p>\"I will just train the horse, and leave the decision to [her owner] Lord Derby,\" Ed Dunlop, Ouija Board's trainer said. \"I'm sure she's got enough speed for the shorter race, but the disadvantage there is that the stalls are almost on the bend. </p> <p>\"But on the official ratings I think she's 5lb higher than anything else in the race, so she would deserve to be favourite, and if she gets some luck in running, she would have a great chance.\" </p> <p>Dunlop saddled Lailani in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf at Belmont three years ago, when she was forced to race wide from stall 12. </p> <p>\"That's the one thing that Kieren [Fallon] is worried about,\" Dunlop said. \"But this filly has more speed than Lailani, and I would hope that would get her out of trouble if she had a draw problem to contend with. </p> <p>\"He was very happy with her when she worked this morning, and she has come out of the Arc [where Ouija Board finished third to Bago] very well. </p> <p>\"She has a fantastic temperament. She is so laid back and doesn't worry about anything. She has become a little film star, she doesn't bat an eyelid, and hopefully that will hold good for the long-term.\" </p> <p>The Tote make Ouija Board their 7-4 favourite for the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, ahead of Bobby Frankel's Light Jig on 5-1. Should her connections opt to run in the Turf, which has a prize fund of $2,000,000, twice as much as her alternative engagement, she would be expected to start second-favourite behind Kitten's Joy, the best turf horse in America at present. </p> <p>Coral quote Kitten's Joy at 7-4 for the Turf, ahead of Ouija Board on 11-4, with Aidan O'Brien's Powerscourt, who was disqualified from first place in the Arlington Million in the summer, rated a 5-1 chance. </p> <p>Britain's remaining challenger at the meeting, in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, will be Jeremy Noseda's two-year-old Wilko, whose sire, Awesome Again, won the Breeders' Cup Classic in 1998. Last time out, Wilko finished third in the Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot, less than two lengths behind the runner-up, Aidan O'Brien's Scandinavia. That colt is also among just eight entries for the Juvenile, in which Bob Baffert's Roman Ruler is expected to start favourite. </p> <p>Elsewhere on the card, Europe will have a strong team in the Mile on turf, with Six Perfections attempting to emulate Miesque by winning the race for the second year running. Whipper, who took the Group One Prix Jacques le Marois in August, is also well-fancied for this event, while Diamond Green and Antonius Pius are also intended runners. </p> <p>One familiar face who will not be at the meeting is top American jockey Gary Stevens. He will be boycotting the meeting because of concerns that jockeys in the States are offered inadequate insurance cover. </p> <p>Stevens, who quit as stable jockey to French trainer Andre Fabre in the summer, has revealed that he had medical bills of over $1m after a fall in the Arlington Million last year but can only get insurance cover for up to $100,000.</p>"
