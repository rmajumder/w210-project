  "<p>The European Union will on Monday ban all European companies from investing in Burmese firms controlled by or linked to the military dictatorship in Rangoon, senior Dutch diplomats said yesterday. </p> <p>In a package of sanctions planned by the EU against the regime in Burma, foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, will also vote against extending any loans to the country from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. </p> <p>Speaking as leaders from 38 countries descended on Hanoi for the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit, Thom de Bruijn, the Dutch EU ambassador, said the failure of the Rangoon authorities to respond to EU demands for reforms on democratic and human rights, including freeing opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, meant there was no choice but to impose sanctions. </p> <p>In August the Burma Campaign UK published a \"dirty list\" of 95 companies directly or indirectly helping to finance the regime, including Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker, operating through a Singaporean subsidiary, and Lloyd's of London. </p> <p>Others, including British American Tobacco, accountants Pricewaterhouse Coopers and advertising group WPP, have ended their involvement in the past year, the campaign said. </p> <p>Amid misgivings about how the sanctions will be policed, ministers will prohibit EU-registered companies from making financing such as loans or equities available to Burmese state-owned firms, including banks and manufacturers. One aim is to enable Burma's neighbours, such as Thailand, to exert more pressure on Rangoon. </p> <p>The EU is concerned that the sanctions hit the military authorities and their \"cronies\" in state-run firms rather than the Burmese people but there is scepticism this can be achieved. \"It is not our intention to take sanctions that would hurt the population,\" Mr de Bruijn said. </p> <p>But ministers, who will expand a visa ban list to include all Burmese military officers above the rank of brigadier-general, will increase aid for health and education after consultations with local democratic groups, including the National League for Democracy headed by Ms Suu Kyi. </p> <p>According to British campaigners, imports from Burma have more than tripled since Tony Blair came to power in 1997 and reached \u00a362.2m last year.</p>",
  "Hundreds of cats are being drafted in to tackle a plague of hundreds of thousands of rats taking over an isolated village in northern Mexico. <p>The state authorities transported the first few dozen cats to Atascaderos in the Tarahumara mountain region this week and said they hoped 300 more will follow by the weekend. </p> <p>The aim is that every household should eventually receive one. </p> <p>The cats are being recruited in the city of Chihuahua, three hours' drive north, partly through advertisements in the local press asking for donated pets and strays. </p> <p>Traps for the rats are being set in the village and its surrounding fields, and balls of maize, sugar and plaster intended to kill the rats by blocking their intestines are being scattered. </p> <p>Health officials are also organising hygiene workshops in the hope of keeping disease at bay. </p> <p>\"It's like The Pied Piper of Hamelin, but unfortunately that flautist doesn't exist and what we have here is an imminent health problem,\" Roberto Gallegos, the local health official in charge of cat recruitment, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>The rat problem in Atascaderos began a year ago but got out of control after villagers used a particularly strong poison that also killed off the rodents' natural predators, including the local cats. </p> <p>A teenager interviewed on Mexican television said the infestation was now so acute that he killed between 10 and 20 rats every night. </p> <p>As their numbers swell the rats are also getting bolder, fearlessly wandering around during the day as they chomp their way through corn stores, maize fields and apple orchards. </p> <p>The fear is that they could begin to attack animals and people too. </p> <p>Neighbouring villages are also reporting rat invasions.</p>",

  "<p>Unilever was on a collision course with trade unions last night after deciding to cut 600 jobs and close a huge Birds Eye plant in Grimsby that has been producing food for nearly 60 years. </p> <p>The decision came just as aerospace manufacturer Shorts-Bombardier revealed plans to cut 560 jobs at its Belfast facility and mobile telephone group Orange said it would reduce its workforce by up to 300. </p> <p>The GMB union said the 1,500 redundancies followed 6,300 last month and added up to a crisis in Britain's manufacturing base. The union described the move in Lincolnshire as a \"kick in the teeth\", even though Unilever has given a reprieve to its Lowestoft plant, which was also under threat. </p> <p>The food giant, which last month issued a sales and profit warning, said it regretted having to shut its only facility in Grimsby but had failed to find an appropriate buyer. </p> <p>About 450 of the jobs to be cut were filled by female workers; there are a further 150 positions in addition to the 600, which were created for a couple of months a year for seasonal staff. </p> <p>The production of Birds Eye dinners will be transferred to specialist third-party suppliers around the end of February next year. \"This has been an exceptionally difficult decision. I very much regret the implications it will have for our employees,\" said James Hill, chairman of Unilever's ice cream and frozen foods arm. </p> <p>The firm argues that it was not economic to invest more in the plant, which it bought 20 years ago and which is in need of extensive modernisation. Plant renewal was rejected on the grounds that the relatively small scale of the business would still leave it at a competitive disadvantage to larger rivals. The Birds Eye site is still extensive, sprawling over 18 acres and including four production lines that made \u00a356m worth of ready-made frozen meals last year. </p> <p>Unilever said most of the jobs in Grimsby were part-time and the operation complemented another in Hull, where the famous fish fingers are made and which will be unaffected by the cuts. The potato processing business in Lowestoft was also part of a Unilever review, but is to be retained in its existing form. </p> <p>The GMB union said Birds Eye staff had worked very hard with Unilever to change work practices and help restructuring. \"It looks like their reward will be 600 kicks in the teeth from Unilever. When you get kicked in the teeth, you fight. The GMB will fight with them,\" said general secretary Kevin Curran. </p> <p>The local authority is also worried about the Unilever decision - on which it had not been consulted in advance. Ivan Hinchliffe, the managing director of north-east Lincolnshire council's economic regeneration agency, described it as a major setback. </p> <p>\"The loss of 600 jobs in any area is a major blow, but especially in a place like this, which is not part of a major conurbation. A household name is leaving the town and there will be more support jobs going too,\" he said. </p> <p>Shorts-Bombardier, Northern Ireland's single largest manufacturing firm, said it, too, \"regretted\" its cuts but blamed the serious downturn in the airline sector. John Wall of the Amicus union said he recognised Shorts faced problems with theUS airlines that make up much of its customer base, but it was essential to \"maintain a world class capability in Belfast\".</p>",

This year, the awards go to: Disaster Action, Woking; Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, Crawley: Norfolk and Norwich Families' House; The Food Train, Dumfries and The Guy Fox History Project, London. <p> The Guardian Charity Awards, in association with Sainsbury's, aim to recognise and encourage small charities. The winners have demonstrated innovative, pioneering work and made an outstanding contribution to social welfare in their communities. Each winner receives a cheque for \u00a35,000 and a new PC from smartchange.org. </p> <p> The winners were decided by a judging panel which included: Naomi Eisenstadt, Director, Sure Start; Stuart Etherington, chief executive, National Council of Voluntary Organisations; Vinay Khosla managing director, Vivid Orange (providers of the smartchange service); Baroness Valerie Howarth; Erica Zimmer, head of public affairs and corporate social responsibility J Sainsbury plc, and David Brindle, public services editor, the Guardian. </p> <p> David Brindle, said: \"The judges have an unenviable task each year having to choose from a diverse and very deserving range of charities. As with previous years we hope that these awards will bring recognition, increase credibility and open doors to future success for the winners.\" </p> <p> -ends- For more information and photographs contact: <br> Diane Heath, Press Office, 020 7239 9936. <br> Notes to editors:<br> The winners <br> <b>Disaster Action</b> <br> Disaster Action is a self-help organisation, offering support to those directly affected by major disasters and raising awareness of the needs of the survivors and the bereaved. <br> Disaster Action has facilitated the amalgamation of family support groups and also written four leaflets in a series called When Disaster Strikes. This charity offers telephone support as well as personal meetings with relevant individuals. <br> All the members have direct personal experience of surviving a major trauma and/or being bereaved by a traumatic event, the result of which has compelled them to bring positive change to others. <br> <b>Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group</b> <br> Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group aims to improve the quality of life for detainees by offering friendship and support. They aim to combat social exclusion of the detainees and facilitate their social integration. Members of the group give talks, write articles and speak on local radio. Their objectives include reducing discrimination towards asylum seekers by sharing stories and firsthand experiences. <br> Detainees are a vulnerable group, most are asylum seekers, many are young and know no one in this country. The volunteers provide a link to the outside world and empower the detainee to help him/herself. <br> <b>Norfolk and Norwich Families' House </b><br> This charity's vision is to improve the quality of life of vulnerable children and their families in Norfolk. <br> Families' House provides supervised contact between parents and their children who are separated from each other and are subject to court proceedings involving divorce, separation and contact issues. Their Adoption Support Help Line provides advice to people on a range of issues. Neutrality is an important element in the delivery of this charity's services. Families' House also provides a social work assistant to the families who is available during the contact sessions should the need arise. <br> <b>The Food Train</b> <br> For the last nine years The Food Train has provided a vital lifeline to hundreds of older, housebound and disabled people in Dumfries and Galloway by delivering groceries and providing support. <br> The service fills a large void for older people who do not qualify for home care but who, nevertheless, need support. Teams of trained and supported volunteers visit each customer twice weekly, the volunteers are often the only people they see in a week. The charity also provides volunteering opportunities to people with learning disabilities, mental health problems, physical disabilities and the long term unemployed. <br> The service actively helps to keep people living independently at home and the principle is well supported by the local social service department. <br> <b>The Guy Fox History Project</b> <br> This is an educational arts and heritage charity, working with children in Southwark, London. It uses studio workshops, which combine history research, illustration, design and IT development to help children, aged 9-13, create their own magazines, CD-ROMS, maps, audio CDs and websites. Professional designers facilitate sessions and the results of the childrens' labours are then distributed free of charge throughout Southwark's schools and libraries. Their work is based on a simple idea: when you engage children with the past and equip them for the future, it will create a better present.</p>",
  "Three explosions shook popular resorts on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula tonight as many Israelis vacationed at the close of a Jewish holiday. <p>Hospital officials said at least 29 people were killed, and witnesses gave unconfirmed reports that all three explosions were caused by car bombs.</p> <p>Egyptian security officials said there was no evidence of terrorism, but Israel's army radio said officials believed the Taba explosion was a car bomb, and witnesses at the other two sites told relatives that cars had exploded.</p> <p>The first and largest blast shook the Hilton hotel in the Taba resort, only meters (yards) from the Israeli border. Two smaller blasts later struck the area of Ras Shitan, a camping area near the town of Nuweiba south of Taba, witnesses said.</p> <p>An official at Taba Hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his institution had taken in 27 bodies from the Taba explosion and two more from Ras Shitan. An official at the Nuweiba hospital said two more bodies arrived there. Israeli police said at least 30 were killed in the Taba blast alone.</p> <p>Taba Hospital was treating at least 100 injured, and Nuweiba 14. In addition, Israeli medics said they had transferred 22 injured to Israeli hospitals in ambulances and helicopters.</p> <p>The cause of the blasts was unclear. Egyptian officials said they had no evidence of terrorism, but Israel's army radio quoted Israeli security officials as saying they were convinced the Taba explosion was a car bomb.</p> <p>A car rental manager at the Hilton, Mohammed Saleh, said he was in the storeroom when the blast occurred and couldn't see where the explosion originated, but said several people at the hotel claimed it was caused by a car bomb outside the reception area. Some witnesses reported seeing the wreckage of a car.</p> <p>Amsalem Sarrag, whose uncle and cousin own camps in Ras Shitan, said both told him that Israeli cars exploded outside their camps. The two blasts were only five seconds apart, he said.</p> <p>He said the camps were full of vacationing Israelis, but he had no information on the number of casualties.</p> <p>Egyptian security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Taba explosion occurred among gas tanks in the kitchen of the hotel, which is next to the casino where many tourists were at the time of the blast. </p> <p>However, the Haaretz newspaper in Israel said the blast took place in the lobby of the hotel, causing the ceiling to collapse, followed by a fire and the evacuation of guests on upper floors through the emergency exits. The newspaper quoted Israeli security sources as saying there is a growing conviction that the explosion was caused by a terrorist attack. </p> <p>\"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed. There are dozens of people on the floor, lots of blood. It is very tense,\" witness Yigal Vakni told Israel's Army Radio. \"I am standing outside of the hotel, the whole thing is burning and they have nothing to put it out with.\"</p> <p>Witnesses said there were people trapped under the ruins of the western side of the hotel. Saleh, the car rental manager, said a large part of the hotel was destroyed, and about three-quarters of it damaged.</p> <p>Israeli medics drove ambulances across the border to pick up the wounded while other medics were flown to Eilat, just across the border from Taba. The army also sent two helicopters to airlift the wounded to hospitals in Israel.</p> <p>Taba is the main crossing between Israel and Egypt and the gateway for thousands of Israelis who travel to the hotels and resorts on the Red Sea. Thursday is the last day of the weeklong Jewish festival of Sukkot, when thousands of Israelis vacation in the Sinai.</p> <p>Mr Vakni said most of the people at the Hilton were Israeli. </p> <p>\"I was in the casino when it happened,\" he said. \"There was a massive explosion and the left wall came down. People started to run around like crazy.\" </p> <p>On September 9, the Israeli government urged citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a \"concrete\" terror threat to tourists in an area. </p> <p>The warning, issued by the counter-terrorism centre in the prime minister's office, identified Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, where Taba is located, as the target of a potential attack. </p> <p>\"Recently a concrete possibility has emerged that terrorists will try to attack tourist centres in Egypt, especially the Sinai,\" the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement published on its website.</p>",
  "<p>Stan Collymore dramatically walked out of Five's The Farm today after another four-letter bust-up with rap star Vanilla Ice.</p> <p>The former Liverpool and England footballer is the second contestant to quit the reality show after Paul Daniels walked out last week. The magician's replacement, Terry Christian, was voted off the show yesterday, leaving just six celebrities left.</p> <p>Collymore walked out after moaning that the US rapper - real name Robert van Winkle - spent too long in the bathroom and wasn't pulling his weight around the farm.</p> <p>\"Get him out!\" he shouted at Rebecca Loos, who was nominated as the farm \"manager\". \"[He's always] fucking on the toilet. Doesn't it bother any of you?\" he asked. </p> <p>\"It does, Stan, but what can you do? You can't drag him off the loo,\" replied Daniels' wife, Debbie McGee, another contestant on the show. But Collymore stormed off, shouting: \"I want him working, and if he fucking don't, I'm off.\"</p> <p>A Five spokesman said: \"Stan felt he had spent enough time on the farm. There were a number of factors involved in his decision. He felt other people weren't putting in as much effort as he was, and if he stayed he would only have grown more frustrated. That is the harsh reality of farming life.\"</p> <p>The footballer, whose autobiography has just been published, had also complained of missing his children, and had said he was disappointed that Christian, the former Word presenter drafted in to replace Daniels, had been voted off. An earlier four-letter row with Van Winkle forced Five to cut the sound to the show for an hour.</p> <p>The RSPCA today joined criticism of the reality show after Rebecca Loos was shown masturbating a pig. The charity condemned the antics of David Beckham's former PA as \"morbid and sordid\" and called on viewers to boycott the show.</p> <p>\"The RSPCA expressed its serious concerns to the producers before and throughout the show, and procedures undertaken with animals by the celebrities to date confirm our view that the programme should never have been made,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>\"Officials from the RSPCA are monitoring the show and have been detailing the society's concerns to the programme makers, Endemol, on a daily basis. </p> <p>\"The RSPCA is urging people to avoid watching the show and to complain to the programme-makers, the broadcaster and Ofcom.\" </p> <p>Loos donned rubber gloves to arouse the animal before collecting around a third of a litre of semen in a flask. The specimen was taken away and will be used to inseminate sows.</p> <p>But the stunt failed to boost ratings for the show, which slipped back last night to 1.3 million, an 8% share of the audience.</p> <p>Dr Julia Wrathall, head of the RSPCA's farm animals department, said: \"Good husbandry requires skill, knowledge, experience and rigorous training, none of which the celebrities have. </p> <p>\"There is a real risk of causing distress and suffering to the animals involved, and any educational merit the programme may have had has been completely overshadowed by concerns about the negative effects on the animals involved. </p> <p>\"Some of the antics of the celebrities only serve to create a morbid and sordid fascination in perfectly natural animal behaviour.\" </p> <p>A Five spokesman insisted the farm is renowned for its animal welfare standards and said all tasks were overseen by professional farmers, agricultural experts and vets.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<b> Life before</b> <br> <p>Shopping for clothes means one thing to me: standing outside a changing room in, say, Diesel/LK Bennett/Zara/Jigsaw/M&amp;S/Joseph/Gap - they all blur after a while - waiting for Jane to try something on while I bemoan the lost opportunity to be at home watching Football Focus. I really can't think of many things I'd rather be doing less. I'm of the uniquely male mentality, it seems, that clothes shopping is a mundane, functional fact of life that should be performed with near-military precision and efficiency: ie get in there, get the job done, and extract yourself as fast as possible.</p> <p>I'm not ashamed to say that I'm entirely happy for Jane to dress me. Not literally, of course: I mean when Jane comes home from a shopping trip (from bitter experience, she now usually goes alone or with friends) and hands me a bag of clothes and says, \"Here, I bought these for you.\" It's an arrangement that suits us both.</p> <p><b> The ethical audit</b><br></p> <p>The auditors: <b>Hannah Berry</b>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <b>Mike Childs</b>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <b>Renee Elliott</b>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>Hannah begins by asking us questions about what sort of clothes we wear and where we buy them. My response takes a lot less time than Jane's. \"From what you say,\" says Hannah, \"it suggests that you tend to go for quality rather than label-laden clothes. And you don't suffer from Imelda Marcos tendencies.\"</p> <p>I look to Jane to see how she has taken this woman-to-woman fashion assessment. This could be quite a volatile part of the ethical audit, given her sensitivity to the threat of being told to change the way she dresses. \"This is positive,\" says Hannah (dressed in jeans, T-shirt and velour hooded top), probably sensing the tension, \"because the overconsumption of clothing driven by fashion is taking a huge toll on the environment.\"</p> <p>\"Like most people, you buy your clothes on the high street,\" says Mike (jeans and green cotton shirt). \"While this scores highly on the convenience front, it leaves a lot to be desired from an ethical point of view. Mass-produced fashion is a globalised industry, raising concerns about sweatshop labour, health, safety and environmental standards, as well as the environmental concerns associated with goods being transported around the world. Cheap fashions tend to be disposable in nature, with few garments designed to last more than a season.\"</p> <p>Using the word \"cheap\" in relation to our clothes seems potentially incendiary, so I look to Renee (black trousers and cream silk twinset). \"I don't think you're wearing organic clothes, are you? You look too trendy,\" she says.</p> <p>I smile, but again I'm not sure flattery is going to win Jane over. \"But,\" continues Renee, \"it is worth considering organic cotton, particularly for baby Esme, because cotton is the most highly sprayed textile in the world. It accounts for nearly 25% of the total global insecticide market. If you choose fabrics made from organic cotton, you are getting clothes that not only do not carry pesticide residues but are also not bleached with chlorine dyes, nor coloured with heavy metal dyes.</p> <p>\"You should also try to avoid fabrics that are 'easy care' or 'non-iron'. Many have been treated with formaldehyde - classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a probable human carcinogen under conditions of 'unusually high or prolonged exposure'.\"</p> <p>Jane asks about the breadth of organic clothing now on offer. \"Organic clothes are also available in hemp and wool,\" says Renee. \"There are now dozens of companies producing a wide range of organic clothes, including jeans, T-shirts and yoga wear. Some of these are fashionable and well designed.\"</p> <p>Hannah agrees that hunting down clothes made from organic textiles is an important step when sourcing clothes. \"As well as being heavily sprayed with pesticides, cotton - 45% of which is now genetically modified - is also one of the most heavily irrigated crops. In countries with weak or nonexistent pollution controls, where dyeing activities are concentrated, reactive dyes and wastes are regularly flushed straight into watercourses. Also, petrochemical-derived synthetic fabrics are often non-biodegradable.\"</p> <p>I ask about the issue of sweatshops. \"It almost goes without saying that the price of our clothes-buying addiction is paid by those at the bottom of the supply chain,\" responds Hannah. \"But you should note that high-profile workers' rights campaigns, targeted at well-known clothing brands, are not always calls for a consumer boycott. They are often about getting companies to ensure that subcontractors provide fair wages and conditions, and persuading them not to relocate whenever abuses are exposed, thereby leaving workers without jobs.</p> <p>\"The websites <a href=\"http://www.cleanclothes.org\">www.cleanclothes.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sweatshopwatch.org\">www.sweatshopwatch.org</a> both explain the difference between 'worker-called' boycotts, which should be supported, and campaigns which prefer customers to routinely question retailers on, for example, whether they enforce an independently monitored code of conduct, and fix prices to suppliers in function of what is needed for them to pay a living wage.\"</p> <p>Jane makes the point that she has never seen any clothing in the shops that promises to answer these concerns. Mike nods. \"But alternatives for the ethical shopper do exist. However, they tend to involve extra effort or extra cash. Ethical clothing outlets can be found, especially online, with manufacturers such as Ethical Threads. Naturalcollection.com includes more environmentally friendly clothing and, although it is unlikely to satisfy logo junkies, it does the job with some style.\"</p> <p>Another option, says Mike, is to buy second-hand clothes. \"Acquiring the second-hand habit requires practice and a creative approach to style, but can be a cheaper way to stock your wardrobe. Alternatively, if you have time and the skills, you could try making your own clothes. Some claim that knitting is the latest craze - and it can be far more relaxing than a trudge down the high street, or so I'm told.\"</p> <p>And don't forget to give your cast-offs to charity shops such as Oxfam so that they can resell or recycle them, adds Renee.</p> <p>Jane concludes with a question about her favourite subject: shoes. \"Can I buy leather shoes?\" she asks. Hannah doesn't answer directly, but makes a general point about how animals are used to make clothes. \"Around 10% of an animal's value is in its skin, so leather isn't entirely a by-product of the meat industry. Non-leather, non-PVC footwear ordered through, for example, Vegetarian Shoes [<a href=\"http://www.vegetarian- shoes.co.uk\">www.vegetarian- shoes.co.uk</a>, tel 01273 691913] or Green Shoes [<a href=\"http://www.greenshoes.co.uk\">www.greenshoes.co.uk</a>, tel 01803 864997] can often take account of sweatshop concerns as well as animal welfare ones.\"</p> <p><b> Life after</b><br></p> <p>Jane wasn't sold on the idea of ethical clothing. At all. The bottom line, she said after the auditors had left, was that she wouldn't wear anything that she didn't like and feel comfortable in.</p> <p>I was always going to be on thin ice when it came to trying to coax Jane into reassessing her - our - wardrobe, and she was far from impressed by the ethical clothing mail-order catalogues that arrived. But she did agree to go on an ethical shopping trip with me: \"You'll get to go out to the shops like normal and I'll get to act on the auditors' advice,\" I said.</p> <p>My mistake was thinking that London would offer myriad options on the ethical clothes front. But other than the local charity shops, I was left scratching my head. However, after some research online, I found that two ethical retailers had recently opened in central London - American Apparel in Carnaby Street and People Tree in Selfridges on Oxford Street.</p> <p>I also found out there was a Traid shop in Brixton, near where we live - a shop I had always assumed to be a charity shop, but learned was actually a good place to find \"vintage\" clothes and secondhand designer wear.</p> <p>After much hunting around in Selfridges, we found the People Tree concession on the second floor. People Tree, I had learned on their website (<a href=\"http://www.ptree.co.uk\">www.ptree.co.uk</a>, tel 0845-450 4595), uses organic cotton and helps \"marginalised producers to improve their lives by giving design and quality skills, a fair price, regular orders, and advance payment as needed\". But Jane stood in front of the two racks, looked at the merchandise, waved her hand in front of it and said, \"No, to all of that.\" To be fair to her, it was a little too, in her words, \"80s retro\".</p> <p>We then went to Carnaby Street in search of American Apparel (<a href=\"http://www.americanapparel.co.uk\">www.americanapparel.co.uk</a>, tel 020-7734 4477), whose clothes are produced \"sweatshop-free\" in a factory in Los Angeles where employees are paid $12.50 an hour, more than double the minimum wage. As this was an entire shop over two floors, there was much more to choose from - even if we did feel a little out of place among the skater kids who seemed to be its target demographic. We bought some T-shirts and tops and even some things for Esme.</p> <p>The trip to Traid (eight shops in London and Brighton, <a href=\"http://www.traid.org.uk\">www.traid.org.uk</a>, tel 020-8733 2580) was successful, too. For me at least. Jane just couldn't get over her phobia of wearing second-hand clothes, but I managed to find a pair of jeans (\u00a315) and a John Rocha jacket (\u00a330).</p> <p>The one thing missing from my \"new head-to-toe ethical look\", as Jane mocked, was a pair of shoes. Hannah had told me that Adbusters (<a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org\">www.adbusters.org</a>), the Canadian anti-corporate magazine, sold a pair of trainers that were \"sweatshop-free\", but then I heard that a similar concept trainer, made by US-based No Sweat Apparel (<a href=\"http://www.nosweatapparel.com\">www.nosweatapparel.com</a>), was available in the UK through Fair Deal Trading (<a href=\"http://www.fairdealtrading.com\">www.fairdealtrading.com</a>, tel 0870 766 5196). They looked a little like a pair of Converse All Star sneakers I had as a child, and for \u00a325 seemed like good value, too.</p> <p>For more about Leo's experiment, and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a> Leo's next report, on volunteering, will appear in two weeks.</p>",
  "Michael Howard today made a bold appeal for disillusioned Labour voters to \"come and join us\" as he closed the Conservative party conference - his first as party leader and probably the last before a general election. <p>Publishing his \"timetable for action\" - a programme of policies for the first hours, days and months of a new Tory administration - Mr Howard claimed he would form a government \"generous in spirit and competent in action\".</p> <p>And, ignoring the threat from the Liberal Democrats, he used his final address to delegates in Bournemouth to make a direct call to voters: \"So to those who voted Labour last time, who dream of a better life, who work hard but feel let down, I say, come and join us.\"</p> <p>Speaking to the media before his second, and final, speech of the conference, he insisted the general election was \"there to be won\". </p> <p>But he ducked questions over whether he would quit if he lost the election. He said he was accountable to the party and it was up to members to decide his position. </p> <p>He has told the conference Tory ministers would be sacked if they failed to deliver on their promises. </p> <p>Asked if Margaret Thatcher should have sacked him from her cabinet over the poll tax, he conceded the policy was a mistake but sought to distance himself from it. </p> <p>\"The poll tax was a policy for which many people were responsible,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>\"I was responsible for taking the legislation through parliament. It was a mistake, of course it was a mistake. I have apologised for it.\" </p> <p>The Tory leader again refused to commit to cutting taxes. </p> <p>\"It is because we are being so rigorous that I am not taking the easy path and making immediate promises about tax cuts, because I am not yet certain that we could deliver on those promises,\" he said. </p> <p>In an earlier question and answer session with the retired broadcaster Sir Michael Brunson, Mr Howard admitted that \"I don't think we always used our time in opposition as well as we should\", and a confessed he had not originally wanted to return to frontline politics.</p> <p>He told delegates that after leaving William Hague's frontbench he only returned under Iain Duncan Smith because of the number of complaints from constituents about the NHS - which he claimed numbered more in two years under Labour than in 17 years under the Tories.</p> <p>He said: \"I hadn't been intending to [come back to the frontbench] but I got very angry about what was happening to the NHS in my constituency.\"</p> <p>Just as for his formal speech on Tuesday, Mr Howard was serenaded in and out of the conference hall to the stirring chords of Elgar's Nimrod.</p> <p>Party chairman, Dr Liam Fox, sending delegates on their way, praised party unity.</p> <p>He said: \"This is more focused and more disciplined than any conference in recent years - and that comes from one man, Michael Howard.\"</p> <p>Dr Fox also claimed there had not been so much \"content and clarity\" at a Tory party conference since 1986, when the party under Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbit launched their \"Next Moves Forward\" proposals which helped win the 1987 election.</p> <p>The timetable for action document makes commitments ranging from cutting police paperwork and raising the state pension to tightening immigration controls. </p> <p>Copies of the document were handed out to representatives at the conference, as Mr Howard and some of the shadow cabinet left to go campaigning in the nearby marginal constituency of Mid-Dorset and North Poole.</p> <p>Some 11m copies of a leaflet version of the document will be sent to homes across the country, with Mr Howard and his shadow cabinet team distributing the first handful of copies to voters today. </p> <p>It promised that, after coming to office, the Tories would: <br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first hour, remove political advisers' power over civil servants and make the Office of National Statistics independent.<br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first day, freeze civil service recruitment, set a date for a referendum on the EU constitution, abolish Whitehall targets for hospitals and appoint a minister for homeland security to coordinate action against terrorism. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first week, end the early release scheme for prisoners, free schools to expand, halt proposed cuts in the armed forces and order the publication of hospital superbug infection rates. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first month, introduce 24-hour surveillance at entry ports, restore the link between state pensions and earnings, start a prison-building programme and a 5,000-a-year police recruitment drive and launch an audit of speed cameras to weed out those that are unnecessary. </p> <p>A Tory chancellor's first budget would include a timetable to cut billions of pounds from Whitehall bureaucracy and \"set Britain on the path to lower taxes\". </p> <p>A programme of legislation will be set out to introduce a right to choose in education and health, allow Housing Association tenants to buy their own homes, abolish student fees, introduce a points system for immigrants, require drug-addicted criminals to choose between treatment or prison and free hospitals from central control. </p> <p><b>Reactions</b><br></p> <p>Delegates streaming out of the conference hall passed their verdict on the week.</p> <p>Kulveer Ranger, from Hounslow, said: \"This is my first conference and I've been very, very impressed. A lot of people have said there's a strong buzz about the place and it definitely has been all the way through. Michael Howard has rounded it off brilliantly.</p> <p>\"We have a very, very good chance of winning the next general election if we maintain the momentum we've had this week and get the message across. It's testament to what Liam Fox has done.\"</p> <p>Richard Andrews, a councillor on Medway borough council, said: \"It was one of the best conferences I've been to. It was completely different, with much less showmanship and much more work done. I did feel it got the message across.</p> <p>\"I think our chances at the next election are a lot better than people think they are.</p> <p>Another delegate, Helen Wheeler from Coventry, gave her verdict: \"Really upbeat. The surge of people really wanting to change and make a difference - it is almost got to a critical point now in this country where people want Tony Blair to go. </p> <p>\"We are on a roll and we have to gain the trust again. I understand the people felt out of faith with us. We have to prove again that we can earn their trust.\"</p> <p>James Sproule, prospective parliamentary candidate for Streatham, said: \"It has been a lot better than I expected. A lot of people were a bit depressed about the Tory party last week. </p> <p>\"The media has been negative about us but when it came to it we found there's a lot more on policy and I think the media has found that too. Can we win the next election? - absolutely!\"</p>",
  "<p>The National Theatre has announced details of its National Headlines series, five short plays examining current affairs by writers including Mark Ravenhill and Tanika Gupta. </p> <p>The series is the brainchild of playwright Paul Jepson. Each of the events will involve the performance of a monologue, based on an interview with a real person, after which a panel of opinion-formers, officials and journalists will be invited to discuss the issues that arise. </p> <p>\"The idea,\" says Jepson, \"was to find out what happened if you put a piece of reportage in front of an opinion-former, giving voice to someone who is not in a position of power, but who, because of events, is in an extraordinary situation.\" </p> <p>The subjects tackled will range from foot and mouth and the state of the countryside to asylum seekers and patient care in hospitals. \"My ground rules were that the subjects should not all be metropolitan and they should all be big issues,\" said Jepson. \"I feel the National Theatre has been unpolitical for quite a long time, and it's quite refreshing to see that change.\" </p> <p>Ravenhill, whose monologue is based on interviews with an English teacher, is relatively new to the deeply fashionable form of verbatim theatre, but, after a recent project he worked on with LAMDA students about the Millennium Dome, he has warmed to its possibilities. \"I went to see Come Out Eli, a verbatim piece about the Hackney siege,\" he says. \"I had always thought verbatim theatre would be really hard-hitting. But this wasn't Guant\u00e1namo; it was more Passport to Pimlico - they had a lovely time in Hackney during the siege, people started talking to their neighbours. So I thought, 'Yes, there are all sorts of different ways this material can go.' The dome, too - that turned out to be the story of a big old traditional British cock-up, like a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. </p> <p>\"There are only so many times a year you can dig solely into yourself for material. Verbatim theatre stimulates you in a different way - and you can stop boring everyone with what's going on inside just you.\" </p> <p>The series starts on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Unilever today announced that it was closing a Birds Eye frozen ready meal factory in Grimsby with the loss of 600 jobs.</p> <p>The consumer products giant said the decision to shut the Lincolnshire plant had followed an 11-month review of Birds Eye's three UK sites. The review found that the factory was too small to be competitive in the frozen food market.</p> <p>Unilever said it had been concerned that Grimsby could be at a competitive disadvantage to other manufacturers with bigger scale and lower cost manufacturing sites, and that it was essential to remove that disadvantage. </p> <p>It added that it had unsuccessfully attempted to sell the factory to a specialist third party partner and, although it had also looked at a proposal to invest in the site, it had decided that it would not be economically viable. </p> <p>The factory, which had a turnover of around \u00a356m in 2003, opened in 1946 and consists of four production lines on a site of just over 18 acres.</p> <p>\"Even if we had made large internal investment in the Grimsby plant, we simply couldn't match the scale and innovation capabilities already available from third parties,\" James Hill, the Unilever ice cream and frozen food chairman, said.</p> <p>The Grimsby site's general manager, Roger Norrington, expressed his disappointment that no buyer had been found. \"It would have preserved employment and was the preferred option,\" he said. \"We tried very hard, but it just didn't prove possible in the end.\" </p> <p>The plant, which mostly employs part-time workers, is likely to close during the first quarter of next year, with production being transferred to selected specialist large scale suppliers. </p> <p>Unilever's review also examined a potato product manufacturing operation at the Birds Eye Lowestoft factory in Suffolk. The company said that, although it had considered selling the operation, it would now make no changes. </p> <p>Birds Eye employs around 2,700 people in the UK, 750 of whom work at Lowestoft. Unilever shares were this morning up by 0.75p at 462.75p.</p>",

  "He was the reason I could never truly feel British and he epitomised everything I detested about the Thatcher years. In an administration generously staffed by villains, he was easily the most loathsome. Margaret Thatcher's hard man, the Chingford skinhead, the Count Dracula of the Conservative party: he was Norman Tebbit and I hated him. <p>I hated him for many things - for telling the unemployed to get on their bikes, for the union- bashing and the BBC-baiting - but mainly I despised him for having coined the Tebbit test. It was the spring of 1990 when, in an interview with the LA Times, he suggested that a test of the loyalty of British Asians was who they supported in cricket: if they did not cheer for England, he implied, their allegiance to Britain was suspect. It was hugely provocative. In effect he was saying that if you were not with us, then you were against us. </p> <p>No wonder Tebbit became such a hate figure for so many. For young British Asians like me, who failed his cricket test, he provoked fear and revulsion. Just as my father's generation had been taunted by Enoch Powell, I was terrified of Tebbit. I also wondered what he might say if I could talk to him directly. Would he be as cold and offensive if I could speak to him face to face? But what were the chances then of facing Tebbit? None. </p> <p>Finally, however, I got my chance. While making a film for Channel 4, I requested an interview with Lord Tebbit, as he is now, and to my surprise he agreed. And so I find myself in the London Marriott hotel, formerly County Hall, sitting opposite the man who had so frightened me all those years ago. </p> <p>The first surprise is how harmless he looks. With his smart tweed jacket and black trousers, bifocals and silver hair he seems less the monster of my youth, and more what he is today: a frail 73-year-old. The second surprise was the softness of his voice. He speaks in the quiet, level tone of someone willing to listen. He smiles easily and often. </p> <p>But although being out of frontline politics may have mellowed him, that does not absolve him of his past, and it is that past I wanted to discuss with him. </p> <p>He was born in Enfield and was a journalist and pilot before entering politics 34 years ago. Unlike many of his blander contemporaries in the Thatcher administration - Tom King, Kenneth Baker - Tebbit's public image was spiky and steely: the satirical puppet programme Spitting Image depicted him as an Essex skinhead. \"In politics you are lucky to be remembered for anything,\" he tells me. \"At least I have survived. </p> <p>\"The most interesting thing about the cricket test was that it was an almost throwaway remark made 14 years ago and people are still talking about it.\" </p> <p>What those remarks were about and how they were interpreted are, he claims, two separate things. \"I was talking about the problems of multiculturalism and my remark was about how you tell if people are being integrated,\" he says. \"I felt irritated that most of them were born here but that they had not got used to the idea that they were British and I found that hard to take.\" </p> <p>For Tebbit, the responsibility for integration lay with the immigrant communities. Those who came to this country ought not to try to change where they had come to into a version of what they had left behind. I have sympathy for that argument, but what Tebbit failed to appreciate was that our ambivalence towards Britain was partly due to the actions and statements of his own government. What was the point of declaring that we were British when the prime minister had herself voiced concerns that the country was being swamped by immigrants? </p> <p>So while Tebbit's observation about cricket was accurate he did not realise that for many he was the reason why we found it so hard to summon up any feelings of patriotism. I wonder if he regretted the offence he caused, or whether it was intentional. At first he seems to question whether he did cause offence. I assure him that he did. </p> <p>\"If they were offended it was for the wrong reasons,\" he says curtly. \"They thought it was an attack on them when in fact it was a social comment. And that raises questions of whether they wanted to integrate or remain separate.\" </p> <p>In other words, if we were upset, it was our problem. But what about the mood music of the Conservative years; the sea of union flags at conferences, the reluctance to allow British Asians to bring their families to this country, the stop-and-search laws; could he not accept that it helped create distrust and cooled any potential loyalty among young Asians? He plays a straight bat, insisting it was \"the mood music that perhaps was being heard but it was not necessarily what was being played\". </p> <p>One of the reasons Tebbit was given such a hard time for his comments was that many of us were sceptical of his motives. There was a deep-rooted suspicion that the Conservatives considered immigration an affliction rather than a boon for Britain. Does he think Britain is a better country today because of its immigrants? \"I sometimes look at London and think, is this my city any more?\" he replies, a touch sadly. \"Because it is such a mix of races of peoples and cultures, and I have to say I was more comfortable with it as it was before. But it is there and it is happening and there are lots of things to be gained from it.\" </p> <p>He appears less than convinced about the benefits of integration. \"I sometimes think of our northern towns where there are large Asian communities who are looking out into society and they are being urged to integrate. It does not look like an attractive society and the people they are being urged to integrate with are not people I would particularly like to integrate with.\" </p> <p>He doesn't seem to be aware of the irony that his apprehension at the benefits of integration are shared by some militant Muslims who are equally repulsed by what they see as the moral failings of modern society. During his time in power, the dangers of integration were a social issue; these days they are a matter of national and international security. Tebbit was arguably ahead of his time since the questions he was raising have taken on far greater urgency and relevance in the wake of September 11. Maybe that is why the cricket test continues to have resonance; these days the notion of a shared Britishness is something that this government has encoded into law with tests of citizenship. </p> <p>Tebbit feels there is some better thinking these days, but amazingly goes on to say that he has sometimes been moved to warn David Blunkett that his policies are too illiberal. Since the Conservatives lost power, a new generation of Asians have grown up in this country with even weaker ties to the old countries. As their knowledge of their culture has diluted, Tebbit fears they are adopting some of the worst values of the British. Meanwhile, an Indian-born cricketer (Nasser Hussain) has led the England team and it has become acceptable to fly the flag of St George, once loaded with far-right symbolism. \"I think we've seized it back from the nasties of this world,\" Tebbit tells me. But I thought you were one of the nasties of the world? He smiles broadly. \"You can't expect me to agree with that, can you?\" </p> <p>Our time is almost at an end. Tebbit has to go to the Lords to catch up with Iain Duncan Smith. As the photographer shoots away, I wonder whose views have changed more over the past 15 years - Tebbit's, or mine? During the course of our conversation I had found myself agreeing with him more than I disagreed; agreed that integration should be welcomed, agreed that having allegiance to something called Britishness needs to be encouraged, even agreed that today's teenage British Asians ought to cheer for England. But as we shook hands and he stepped slowly towards his waiting car, I also found myself wondering how different things might be if, back when he had power, Tebbit had condemned us a little less and tried to understand a little more.</p>",
  "As Tony Blair sits down to a summit in Ethiopia today the stakes - or hype - could not be greater: the rescue of Africa. <p>The British prime minister's commission on Africa is meeting on the continent for the first time to further an ambitious plan to heal what he calls a scar on the world's conscience.</p> <p>Africa's poverty and conflict is to be at the heart of next year's British presidency of the European Union and leadership of the G8 group of industrialised nations.</p> <p>Flanked by the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, and the Irish musician turned activist Bob Geldof, Mr Blair is expected to outline the west's duty to rethink its policies on trade, aid and debt.</p> <p>There will be much talk of helping Africa to help itself, of unleashing the potential of a continent neither hopeless nor helpless but eager and able to develop. </p> <p>That is noble and sensible. End unfair European and US trade policies, for example, and Africa could export much more cotton and sugar.</p> <p>But there is a catch: given the opportunity to progress, how tightly would the continent grasp it? Would Africa's leaders take the bold and sometimes difficult decisions to uplift their people?</p> <p>The past few decades have witnessed the emergence of a series of tyrants, kleptocrats and bumblers who drove their countries into the ground. If their ilk are still in charge, Mr Blair's commission will fail, no matter how well received in the west.</p> <p>The prime minister knows this, which is why he will allude to the need for \"governance\", \"transparency\" and \"leadership\", codewords for rulers not to steal or aggrandize. Mr Geldof is likely to make the same point in more earthy language.</p> <p>But evidently both men think African governments can be partners in the great rescue mission, otherwise they would not have launched it. </p> <p>It follows an evolution in aid policy, championed by Britain's former development secretary, Clare Short, to break the donor habit of micromanaging aid projects and instead giving the money to governments and allowing them to spend it. \"Capacity building,\" in the jargon.</p> <p>The commission is not due to report its findings until next year but odds are it will recommend, among other things, that the west cancel debt and end trade distortions and that Africa promote relatively clean, competent leadership.</p> <p>Could the continent deliver that? Some countries, the likes of Botswana, South Africa and Senegal, already do, and a regional initiative, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad), is spreading the good governance gospel.</p> <p>But you have to wonder. To travel through Angola, Swaziland, Congo and Nigeria is to undertake an odyssey in corruption. From immigration officials to police officers to politicians, fingers rub together demanding bribes, behaviour which trickles from the top down. </p> <p>I remember four municipal officials in Malawi insisting that I accompany them on a tour of rural water pumps yet they showed zero interest in the pumps, the villagers or my questions. The reason: they just wanted the field trip allowance. Hardly grand avarice but they reeked of contempt for the people they were supposed to serve.</p> <p>Africa is a continent of workshops, where NGOs gather experts in sanitation, nutrition and disease. Some are excellent but many are attended by visibly bored, unmotivated delegates interested solely in the \"sitting\" allowance. In Malawi, a defunct political party was revived solely to cash in on a western-funded democracy workshop. </p> <p>Mr Geldof knows well the difficulties. Last year he made an impassioned speech to Ethiopian dignitaries in Addis Ababa, where the commission meets today, and called on the city's mayor, the country's president and the head of the orthodox church to accompany him to a HIV clinic where they would all be tested.</p> <p>Stigma inhibits the fight against HIV/Aids, which drives poverty and hunger, so the Irishman's challenge was an opportunity for the three political and religious leaders to do precisely that, lead. They chose not to.</p>",
  "<p>New Mexico, probably. Entrepreneur Burt Rutan finally won the Ansari X- Prize of $10m on Monday when his Space Ship One - carried up in a high-altitude plane, White Knight - rocketed to 100km twice in five days, carrying the equivalent weight of three people, and then landed safely in the Mojave desert of California. </p> <p>Experts hailed the event as the first step towards space tourism. Sir Richard Branson announced that in 2007 he would be offering rocket trips to space, or rather to the notional edge of space, where passengers would experience a short spell of free fall before returning to Earth. </p> <p>But Rutan was just one of more than 20 hopefuls with plans to carry people out of this world, and the competition will go on. Ambitious launchers will next year head for New Mexico's White Sands missile base, because the Ansari X-Prize is about to evolve into a regular contest called the X-Prize Cup. Teams will compete for fastest turnround time between first and second flights; most passengers per launch, total number of passengers during the contest, highest altitude and fastest flight time. Eventually, the X-Prize Cup will be based 30 miles north of Las Cruces, where New Mexico will build something already dubbed the Southwest Regional Spaceport.</p>",
  "<p>Tate Modern's exhibition Time Zones is long overdue, the first survey of time in recent film and video that the Tate has ever mounted. One could quibble and say that the subject applies to almost anything, and complain too that not all the work is terribly recent, or entirely unfamiliar, though only one work has, to my knowledge, been shown before in London. It is thoughtfully presented, however - a juxtaposition of very different styles and sensibilities. </p> <p>With engagingly rough-textured directness, Turkish artist Fikret Atay encouraged a pair of bored teenagers in his hometown of Batman, Turkey, to improvise a Kurdish song and dance in the town's grubby ATM booth. There's a subtext: Kurdish music was banned for a long time in Turkey, and the presence of the cash machine is at odds with the down-at-heel, probably cardless kids, for whom the booth is as much as anything a place to get out of the wind. </p> <p>How different in style this is to the exquisite mannerism of Shanghai-based Yang Fudong's Liu Lan. In this pale, watery black and white film, a young man in a white suit meets - or perhaps fantasises about meeting - a traditionally dressed country girl who lives beside a reed-fringed lake. The dreamy nostalgia of the film is heightened by the sadness and sentimentality of the music, the stylised acting, and the woodblock-cut credits at the end, as though the film comes from another time. </p> <p>Time in Yang's work feels elastic, cyclical rather than linear - just as it is in Serbian artist Bojan Sarcevic's circular walk through Bangkok. It's a purposeful yet absurdly pointless stride that brooks no interference, and engages no interest from the slower-paced street-sellers and hawkers of the city. I expect him to come a cropper like Monsieur Hulot. He doesn't. </p> <p>Unlike Sarcevic, we can drift through the day along with the 12-hour continuous take of the Zocalo, the vast square in the centre of Mexico City, by Francis Al\u00ffs, and zone out in the slow ecclesiastical time of Wolfgang Staehle's live-feed webcam shot of the 11th-century monastery at Comburg in Germany. The monastery, viewed on its distant hill, was yesterday afternoon a German picture postcard in the slanting autumn sun. By evening it was pretty dark, as one would expect. Stay long enough and the place will be obliterated by rain, wrapped in fog and capped by winter snow. The seasons will turn, the nights lengthen towards the winter solstice ... you get the picture. </p> <p>We could do with a few sofas, rather than the dodgy ergonomics of Tate Modern's benches. When Al\u00ffs's Zocalo, May 20, 1999 was last seen in London in a Lisson Gallery show, you could stretch out as the shadow of the enormous flagpole in the centre of the Zocalo made its 12-hour, sun-dial sweep of the square. People line up to stand in the shadow, huddling together at the flagpole's base at midday. </p> <p>Constant vigilance and rapt attention aren't what works like Al\u00ffs's or Staehle's are really asking for. They are opportunities for a different kind of immersion, another register of perception. It is not so much a case of watching them closely as of their slowly unrolling or endlessly looped presentness. </p> <p>I could also keep watching Fiona Tan's camera all day, as it inquires, insinuates, probes and glides over the make-up and kimonos, the faces and jewellery and hairdos of the Toyisha archery festival in Japan, where young girls perform a highly stylised archery contest as a rite of passage into adulthood. Saint Sebastian appears an almost entirely celebratory work, apart from the title, and filled with visual texture and pleasure and tiny human incident. Nowadays, this is a rare thing, and I have to say I loved it in a way I doubt Tan intended. </p> <p>Jeroen de Rijke and Willem de Rooij's 10-minute view of a Jakarta cemetery, one of two films the pair have made in the city, also has an intent more subtle than it appears. Their work is characterised by space and atmosphere as much as it is preoccupied by the passing of time. Strollers and mourners drift between the graves. The towers of the city crowd the horizon, like different kinds of tombs. It is as though we were hovering slightly above it all, with a highly focused, elevated view. Like God, perhaps. The work of these two artists from the Netherlands is painterly and rich; I kept thinking of Courbet. There is always some indefinable pathos in their calculated witnessing of the passing world. </p> <p>We are also witnesses to the tedious and inane machismo of Israeli car-hounds in their all-terrain gas-guzzlers, as they rev and shunt and stall their cars around the impossible gradients of the tyre-wrecked sand dunes outside Tel Aviv, in Yael Bartana's Kings of the Hill. I guess this is meant as metaphor for the Israeli male mindset, and of a state ranting and miring itself in sand. It works well enough, but I feel the work isn't altogether apposite here. </p> <p>With rather more ingenuity, Anri Sala's 2002 double projection, Blindfold, shows a pair of new, naked billboards in Albania. Their blank, canted metal surfaces catch and reflect the low sunlight, which blasts the static camera like a blinding death ray, bleaching out the sky and surrounding buildings in blisters of light. As the sun moves, the buildings and passersby emerge from a strangely day-for-night, light-shocked gloom. This film almost takes us back to the strategies of 1970s structuralist film-making, yet its matter-of-fact materialism is another metaphor for the fitful emergence of global capitalism in Albania. This isn't Sala's best work, by any means, and though I like the work in Time Zones a lot, I keep thinking this isn't quite the video and film show we need right now. What is needed is more depth, with more than one or two works by each artist. More time, in other words, more space, more sofas. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Time Zones: Recent Film and Video is at Tate Modern, London SE1, until January 2. Details: 020-7887 8008.</p>",
  "<p>The pledge by David Davis, the shadow home secretary, yesterday to \"substantially cut\" immigration because it \"endangered British values\" sparked a furious reaction within the Conservatives' ranks. </p> <p>His promise to set a limit well below the current net migration level of 130,000 a year was wrapped in a strident tone that has not been heard from a senior Conservative politician since Lady Thatcher's \"swamping\" remarks a generation ago. </p> <p>\"Uncontrolled immigration endangers the values that we in Britain rightly treasure,\" said Mr Davis. \"We must act to secure the future - including the future of our settled immigrant populations - before it is too late,\" he said after claiming that uncontrolled immigration would \"fill six new cities the size of Birmingham over the next three decades.\" </p> <p>His declaration that migration \"endangered British values\" sparked a horrified reaction within the Conservative party. One senior Tory said: \"That sent a shiver down my spine. That is not the message we should be sending out.\" </p> <p>One shadow minister said Mr Davis had \"come close to breaching the line of acceptability. There was a context for this speech, which is a pre-election conference. But we will need to keep an eye on him.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats said Mr Davis's speech marked a lurch back into dangerous, ignorant and inflammatory language and policies and pointed out that Michael Howard had only yesterday paid tribute to Britain for giving his family refuge after fleeing Nazi persecution. </p> <p>Habib Rahman, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \"The majority of those who come to Britain do so because they share Britain's faith in liberal democratic values.\" </p> <p>The Tory party co-chairman, Liam Fox, was reported recently to have told a closed meeting that the party needed to talk tough about immigration to woo back rightwing voters who were defecting to the UK Independence party. </p> <p>Mr Davis made no apologies yesterday: \"It is an issue of real public concern. It will be a central issue at the next election and have no doubt: if the legitimate parties don't discuss it, the real danger is that extremists will. We will not give them that opportunity.\" </p> <p>Although the Conservatives said this week they would leave it to parliament to set a limit on migration Mr Davis made clear for the first time that it will be substantially below its current levels in order to \"reassure people about their future\". </p> <p>He promised to reintroduce embarkation controls so people travelling to Britain were checked in and out of the country, and reform the system of work permits. Mr Davis also made clear the party still backs Oliver Letwin's idea of sending asylum applicants to an island to have their claims considered: \"We will also push ahead with reforms to our asylum system, with a system of overseas processing.\" </p> <p>The shadow home secretary also promised much tougher action in the \"war on drugs\" with random drug testing in schools, compulsory drug treatment or prison for of fenders, and a pledge to build 20,000 more prison places at a cost of \u00a3780m by the end of the decade. </p> <p>Mr Davis claimed the introduction of random drug testing in schools was justified by a Sun newspaper survey which had found that 100,000 children aged 13 to 15 had used cocaine. He said Britain had one million hard drug addicts for the first time and said a Tory government would offer them a choice of treatment or prison backed by a tenfold increase in the current 1,700 residential rehabilitation places.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's second largest pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, yesterday admitted another setback in the development of some of its drugs, as it delayed the expected launch of diabetes treatment Galida for a year. </p> <p>The news comes less than a month after the firm's anti-stroke drug Exanta was in effect blocked by United States regulators from sale. The firm had hoped Exanta would be a billion dollar-selling drug. </p> <p>During its annual review yesterday, Sir Tom McKillop, the firm's chief executive, painted a gloomy picture of the industry's prospects. He warned of pressure on drug prices in Europe and the US. He said the cost of research, clinical trials, sales and marketing are \"escalating\" and that margins would be squeezed. The company is responding with a \"root and branch review\" to increase productivity, but Sir Tom said there would be no job cuts. </p> <p>Galida is one of a number of drugs that are being developed for diabetes, metabolic disorders and obesity. As it is in late-stage clinical trials, it was AstraZeneca's most promising drug after Exanta. It is an example of a class of drugs that affect the PPAR genes. When scientists increased the activity of these genes in mice, they created \"marathon mice\" that can run faster and longer. </p> <p>But regulators are worried about the safety of such drugs and have asked AstraZeneca to double the time that it planned to monitor the side-effects to two years, which will delay the company's filing for regulatory approval by a year to 2007. </p> <p>Although analysts expressed some disappointment about the Galida setback and the lack of optimism over Exanta in the US, they were more positive on the company's presentation on its schizophrenia and manic depression treatment Seroquel - which it said had fewer side-effects than competitors' products and did not cause involuntary movements like some rival anti-psychotic drugs. </p> <p>Following concerns about the safety of the company's anti-cholesterol drug, Crestor, AstraZeneca said it will publish all clinical trial data about the side-effects. </p> <p>AstraZeneca tried to soothe fears about Crestor yesterday and said the incidence of a dangerous muscle disease was nowhere near that of Baycol, a similar drug that had to be withdrawn from the market in 2001 after patient deaths. </p> <p>Sir Tom said there was hope that new government measures to curb animal rights activists will be more effective, but added that the movement had hurt investment in research and development. \"I don't know of any company that has come to the UK in recent times. I suspect that this is because of worries about animal activism,\" he said. </p> <p>He warned of \"tremendous competition\" from countries that introduce drugs quickly, such as the US, China and India, which are becoming more \"research-based\". AstraZeneca is setting up clinical research sites in the far east, but Sir Tom said it was not because it is cheaper, but because it wants to work more closely with doctors in China as it tries to boost sales there. He highlighted its expansion in emerging markets such as China and Mexico, where it is adding sales staff. </p> <p>The firm's share price dropped 3% to \u00a322.15, the biggest fall in the FTSE 100.</p>",

  "The September 11 attacks on the US were such an unprecedented form of terrorism that the government was justified in taking strong action to protect its citizens, the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, told nine law lords yesterday. <p>The attorney general defended the government's decision to opt out of Britain's obligations under the European convention on human rights to allow foreign nationals to be detained indefinitely on suspicion of involvement in terrorism. </p> <p>He was responding to an appeal by nine foreign suspects who have been detained for nearly three years in high-security conditions without charge or trial under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. </p> <p>Britain suspended its obligations under article five of the human rights convention - the right to liberty - to pass the act, something which is allowed only in cases of \"public emergency threatening the life of the nation\". </p> <p>The nine men are asking the law lords to declare that Britain's suspension of article five is unlawful and the part of the act under which they are detained is incompatible with the human rights convention. </p> <p>The detainees are free to leave Britain if they wish, but under an absolute obligation in the human rights convention they cannot be returned to their own countries if they face death or torture there. </p> <p>According to Lord Goldsmith's written submissions to the law lords, Britain continues to pursue other options for the detainees. These including trying to persuade third countries to take them, and seeking diplomatic assurances that they will not be subjected to torture if returned to their home countries. </p> <p>But the international organisation Human Rights Watch said yesterday there was evidence that two Egyptian nationals sent home by Sweden after similar assurances had been tortured. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said the events of 2001 demonstrated the threat against western democracies. The UK was a designated target for Islamic extremists. </p> <p>He said the power to detain without trial, which meant the UK had to opt out of the relevant section of the European convention on human rights, had been enacted in response to the threat posed by a group of foreign nationals who had no immigration rights in Britain. </p> <p>The government would have been entitled to deport the men but for the time being cannot because of concern for their human rights - they faced death or torture in their own countries and were seeking asylum in the UK, said Lord Goldsmith. </p> <p>\"But to protect the human rights of the millions of British residents and those whose human rights the government has a duty to protect, we took the view that, if these people cannot be deported, they should not be allowed to roam free on the streets and so they had to be detained. </p> <p>\"This was not a step taken lightly. The government believes it was a legitimate and appropriate response to protect the human rights of the suspected international terrorists ...\" </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said both the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which reviewed the detainees' cases, and the appeal court had concluded that the conditions for opting out had been met.</p> <p>He added this brand of terrorism involved attacks which came without warning after months of careful planning.</p> <p>\"These events required the government of this country to assess the threat to the UK and what measures it was necessary to take to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks ... \" </p> <p>He said these discussions had taken place at the highest political level.

  "The son of Punjabis who came to Britain in the 1960s won one of Britain's leading poetry prizes yesterday with a poem about their experience, and all the generations of immigrants and asylum seekers who came after them. <p>Daljit Nagra's Look We Have Coming to Dover! evokes the lash of the breeze as immigrants reach port, and the \"yobbish rain and wind\" which is their first taste of English weather. </p> <p>It was chosen as this year's best single entry in the Forward poetry prizes. Nagra, born and brought up in west London and a widely published poet, wins \u00a31,000. </p> <p>The chief judge, the poet Lavinia Greenlaw, said: \"Look We Have Coming to Dover! is a poem of contemporary resonance which engages playfully and powerfully with our literary heritage.\" </p> <p>The title reflects - without mockery - the fractured English of his parents' generation. But the verse is a virtuoso exercise in the command of English, with its slang, extreme compression, thrusting verbs and confident references to one of the great poems of the language, Matthew Arnold's Dover Beach, written in 1867. </p> <p>Nagra writes: </p> <p> Seasons or years we reap <br> inland, unclocked by the national eye <br> or a stab in the back, teemed for breathing <br> sweeps of grass through the whistling asthma <br> of parks, burdened, hushed, poling sparks across pylon and pylon.</p> <p>Swarms of us, grafting <br> in the black within shot of the moon's spotlight, <br> banking on the miracle of sun to span <br> its rainbow, passport us to life. <br></p> <p>Only after these years of adaptation, he suggests, can immigrants begin to see the world as Arnold fleetingly did, as \"a land of dreams, / So various, so beautiful, so new\". </p> <p>Nagra beat a shortlist of four: David Constantine, Vona Groarke, Mario Susko and David Minhinnick. </p> <p>The top prize, for best poetry collection, went to Kathleen Jamie for The Tree House, a collection haunted by a line from the German poet Friedrich Holderlin: \"The world is ending its lyric phase.\" Jamie writes, \"I think of this line whenever I hear of a new destruction or threatened extinction. </p> <p>The judges said it \"enlarges ... the scope and capacity of poetry being written today\". </p> <p>The \u00a35,000 Felix Dennis prize for best first collection of poetry went to Leontia Flynn for These Days.</p>"
