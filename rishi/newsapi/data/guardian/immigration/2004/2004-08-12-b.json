  "<p>Last week someone rang to ask me to speak on the radio about the suggestion that racial tensions are increasing among minority communities. Since then the whole hoo-ha about the Channel 4 documentary Who are you calling Nigger? has taken off. </p> <p>As usual, all of this high emotion leads me to think about the odd role of academia. The media requests for off-the-cuff expert testimony have become part of the job of the already too busy academic - we are eager to profile our research interests and to increase public awareness of our work and increasingly our employers encourage such contacts and frown on refusals to perform obediently. So when the phone rings, we talk - however outlandish or ill-considered the questions being asked.</p> <p>In the already much-discussed programme, Darcus Howe visits parts of the west midlands and south London in order to explore his contention that minority ethnic communities are at each other's throats and that these tensions are the most dangerous manifestation of racism in contemporary Britain. Pretty dispiriting viewing and the kind of stuff that I know is going to come up in every second conversation I have with white people in the coming weeks. There are all too many takers for a little bantering backlash, and this is such a tasty opportunity.</p> <p>The whole climate around race equality has become so soured by, I'm guessing, mass hysteria about refugees and asylum-seekers and the still developing and mutating mythology of the home-grown terrorist 'of Asian origin'. It is only a short step to asking 'how can we be wasting time talking about race equality when our whole way of life is under attack?' In the circumstances, hard to get a hearing for tolerance and co-existence, let alone the much more painful business of social change.</p> <p>These are difficult times - record levels of stop and search of Asian men, continuing exclusions both official and non-official of African-Caribbean boys from school, a widening gap between rich and poor, an ugly and unabating war against asylum-seekers that seeps over to become a hostility towards anyone who looks 'foreign'.</p> <p>Surveys in the paper say that most white people have no friends from minority ethnic backgrounds. And my guess is that some of those claiming black best friends are clutching at pretty tenuous links - that bloke from the office party, Mrs Wotsit in the newsagents. My feeling is, sadly, that most white people are not quite ready for multicultural living. Not yet, at least.</p> <p>All the more painful, then, to see young (and a few not so young) Asian and African-Caribbean people so readily bad-mouth other communities - as if saying all this stuff on television is quite alright and has no consequences.</p> <p>This TV version of inter-community relations is pretty scary stuff. Asian youth asserting their right to run other communities off their territory. African-Caribbean youth expressing their hatred and fear of Africans. Tales of racist attacks and calls from more settled minorities to send newcomers home.</p> <p>In the mix we are given some titillating topics. Class - why are (some) Asians doing so much better than African-Caribbeans? Religion - how Islam has politicised some youth and made them militant, unlike the allegedly passive older generation. Not much on politics, except the idea that we used to be oppressed workers together and that now some of us have become bad and racist employers instead. And nothing on sex, apart from the suggestion that interracial relationships have cured white people of their racism - so maybe us minorities should jump on board. The programme ends with dire warnings of the storms to come - unless these burgeoning hatreds are nipped in the bud, presumably by concerted dating.</p> <p>When the credits come up - to my shame - I see that the director is one of the many media types who has plugged me for 'information'. Hard to see how all my well-read and locally nuanced thoughts made any difference. Not for the first time, I wonder if it wouldn't be better to save my breath. In the elastic field of race and ethnic studies, the differences and distinctions between minority communities have been a hot topic of debate for some time. The suggestion that minority communities settled in densely populated city neighbourhoods are showing inter-community rivalries and tensions - and that contemporary forms of feudalism through regeneration funding for community groups exacerbate this tendency - is a subject of extensive and complex debate. </p> <p>New waves of migration change the dynamic within relatively disenfranchised communities. The constant calls to hate and distrust asylum-seekers and Muslims infect minority communities too. No-one is saying that there is a necessary or natural alliance between different ethnicities - that was always something that had to be built through a recognition of our shared interests. </p> <p>But all of this is much more complicated than saying that minority youth are the new race-haters. If that is the story you want to tell, no point bothering academics for insights.</p> <p>I always think that journalism and academia are connected - two points on the line of freedom of thought and expression, one turned to communication, the other to complexity. At best, we complement each other - but at worst, neither one appreciates what the other adds. Which leaves us with inaccessible research and ill-informed journalism.</p> <p>The day after the show airs, I take a leaflet from an African man campaigning for human rights in Congo. We end up having a hushed street conversation about what it means for us all to have this kind of thing in the media - and how it seems that some people will do and say anything to be on television. And although we have only met for a moment, we both agree that we have bigger shared enemies to defeat and that, in the end, we have to be able to live with the person we see in the mirror in the morning. So, on balance, I choose being inaccessible over being ashamed - at least until the next TV researcher calls.</p>",
  "Indian army soldiers and air force helicopters were on alert yesterday in northern India amid fears that a lake created by landslides in the Chinese Himalayas could burst, triggering cross-border floods and threatening thousands of people. <p>Helicopters were ready at bases across northern India in case they were needed for emergency rescue. Aerial surveys, and a warning by China's government, indicate the lake - formed by the blocking of the Parechu river in Tibet - is ready to burst and inundate hundreds of villages in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. </p> <p>The state has evacuated thousands of people from 50 villages that are likely to be submerged if the lake breaches its banks, said Munish Garg, an official in the Kinnaur district. </p> <p>Chinese authorities, who have been monitoring the lake since it was formed after a massive landslide last month, warned India on Wednesday to \"make preparations for disaster prevention\", a Chinese embassy spokeswoman said yesterday. </p> <p>The blockage is in a remote region in the Himalayas marked by difficult terrain and poor access, the spokeswoman, Yang Shuying, said. </p> <p>The Indian army and air force have activated their disaster management plan, setting up emergency teams of doctors, medical assistants, technicians and engineers to help restore telecommunications, roads and bridges, Colonel SK Sakhuja, the Indian army spokesman, said. </p> <p>A similar seasonal lake overflowed in August 2000, killing more than 100 people and washing away dozens of bridges and roads in Himachal Pradesh. </p> <p>Since June, when monsoon rains and flooding began, 2,061 people have died in south Asia, according to official figures. Most of the deaths, 1,215, have occurred in India. </p> <p>Aid workers and government departments were yesterday carrying out relief operations in India's worst-hit state, Bihar, where hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless by the seasonal floods and 698 have died.</p>",
  "Janet Chisholm, one of the most unlikely spies in the history of espionage, has died aged 75, without ever talking about her role in a major British cold war coup. In Moscow, as an officer in the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), she ran Oleg Penkovsky, a colonel in Soviet military intelligence (GRU), who passed Soviet secrets to the west at the time of the 1962 Cuban missile crises. <p>Penkovsky had been trying to offer his services to the west for some years, blatantly buttonholing diplomats and businessmen at receptions and approaching tourists in the street. The CIA considered that he was a Soviet agent provocateur and warned its officers to have nothing to do with him. But the British decided to give him a trial. The problem was how to collect his material in Moscow without alerting the KGB's counter-espionage department. </p> <p>With London's approval, Janet Chisholm, the wife of the embassy's \"visa officer\", Ruari Chisholm, was assigned the job. She would take her young children for a walk in a park. Penkovsky would wander by, stop to admire the youngest child and slip a box of sweets into its pram. The box contained film of secret Soviet papers that Penkovsky had copied with his Minox camera.The idea was that anyone watching would assume it was an innocent, chance encounter between a matronly-looking foreign woman and an avuncular Russian man. </p> <p>What no one in the west realised until too late was that the KGB already knew that the job of \"visa officer\", held by Janet Chisholm's husband, was just a front and that he was actually MI6's head of station in Moscow. The KGB knew this because Ruari Chisholm's previous posting was in MI6's Berlin station, where one of his fellow MI6 officers was George Blake, who had already secretly gone over to the KGB. Blake later admitted that he had given the KGB the names of every MI6 officer he knew. </p> <p>So not only Ruari Chisholm but his wife was also under intense KGB surveillance from the moment they arrived in Moscow. Every time Mrs Chisholm left the embassy she was followed and photographed. It did not take the KGB long to identify the avuncular Russian who met Mrs Chisholm and her children as Penkovsky. </p> <p>But the KGB did not act immediately. It had to consider the possibility that the GRU was trying to recruit Janet Chisholm or that there was some other reason why Penkovsky was meeting her. Any hasty KGB move might wreck an operation by a sister intelligence service and then there would be hell to pay. But a KGB search of Penkovsky's apartment when he was out revealed his cache of spying equipment and incriminating papers. He was arrested, and the Chisholms had to use their diplomatic status to leave the Soviet Union quickly. After a show trial at which Penkovsky confessed, he was found guilty of treason and shot. </p> <p>Aspects of the Penkovsky affair remain controversial. Blake's confession that he had revealed to the KGB that the Chisholms were MI6 officers came in the middle of the Penkovsky operation. Therefore, MI6 had to accept that the KGB were on to Penkovsky because of his meetings with Janet Chisholm. Yet, instead of warning Penkovsky, MI6 allowed the meetings to continue. The then chief of MI6, Sir Dick White, said later that Penkovsky's determination to continue his work and the value of the information he was providing justified leaving him in danger. </p> <p>But the value of Penkovsky's information has since been disputed. Although at the time every morsel was seized on by western intelligence experts, they now find it difficult to identify any single piece of military information that Penkovsky brought which proved to be of major value. One theory is that Penkovsky wrote his message in broad brush strokes. It dealt with capabilities and intentions. President John Kennedy read it and understood. Both he and the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev were educated into the realities of the nuclear age. </p> <p>Janet Anne Deane was one of four daughters of a Royal Engineers officer, born at Kasuali in the foothills of the Himalayas. She was educated at Queen Anne's school, Caversham, where she learnt Russian. She studied French at Grenoble university and attended a secretarial school in London before joining MI6 at the Allied Control Commission in West Germany, where she met her future husband. </p> <p>After Moscow, the Chisholms were posted to Singapore and then had two spells in South Africa. Ruari decided to take early retirement from MI6 and become an author. But he contracted cerebral malaria in Tanzania and died in Scotland a few weeks later. </p> <p>Janet Chisholm continued a life of adventure, and in her 70s went backpacking around Australia and trekking in Tibet. But she never really abandoned the secret world and declined to talk or write about the Penkovsky case and her role in it, despite many attractive offers to do so. </p> <p>She is survived by two sons and two daughters.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Janet Anne Chisholm, born May 7 1929; died July 23 2004</p>",
  "<p>Goldman Sachs yesterday warned of the potentially damaging effect for stock market investors of high oil prices, dubbing the process \"the revenge of the old economy\". </p> <p>Peter Oppenheimer, the investment bank's head of European strategy, made one of the first attempts to place a precise estimate of the effect on stock markets of persistently high oil prices. He warned that a 20% rise in oil could result in a 15% knock to equity markets if other factors remain neutral. At present levels, a 15% decline in the FTSE 100 would be equivalent to 650 points, taking the index back to levels seen during the market panic of March last year. </p> <p>Mr Oppenheimer did not forecast that it would happen - he still thinks a sideways movement in European stock markets is most likely - but warned that oil price risks are \"skewed significantly to the upside\", especially if there is further disruption to existing production. </p> <p>Jeffrey Currie, Goldman's European head of commodities, added that \"a deep fundamental shift\" has taken place in the oil market in the past three to four weeks. It is not just short-term spot oil prices that have risen, but prices for oil for delivery in ten years' time have risen to over $35 a barrel. \"What that is telling you is that there is potential for sustainability of these higher prices,\" said Mr Currie. </p> <p>He said the seeds of the crisis were sown over the past two decades as poor rates of return of energy-related investments persuaded investors to switch capital into the \"new economy\" industries such as telecoms and technology. </p> <p>\"We are not arguing that we are running out of oil - there are substantial reserves,\" he said. \"What we are running out of is the in frastructure to access, supply and deliver that oil. The last time we build infrastructure on that scale was the 1970s.\" </p> <p>That was the period in which production facilities in three major fields - the North Sea, Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico - were established. Mr Currie estimates that oil industry investment now needs to run at $200bn a year, against $100bn in the 1990s and $150bn last year. \"It is likely to be the end of the decade before we solve these problems,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Oppenheimer's research suggests that a 10% rise in oil prices affects European corporate profits by just 1%. \"However, the stock market effect is bigger because higher oil prices affect GDP and inflation, not just [company] earnings. Those that suffer most are financials, because it leads to higher interest rates, and electricity companies.\"</p>",
  "An Italian envoy will fly to Libya tomorrow to discuss radical plans to set up \"reception centres\" for would-be immigrants, with officials from both countries estimating that up to 2 million people have already massed on the north African coast in readiness for an opportunity to travel by boat to Europe. <p>The scale of the problem has been recognised by President Muammar Gadafy's regime, which has indicated that it needs help to deal with the number of people who have travelled to Libya's poorly patrolled coast and the vast open deserts to the south. </p> <p>The reception centre proposal, which has drawn criticism from some quarters, is part of a series of cooperation initiatives Italy is spearheading in an effort to control the flow of desperate illegal immigrants across the Mediterranean from northern Africa. </p> <p>Libya is the only north African country which does not have a formal agreement with the EU on tackling illegal immigration, and has become the focal point of refugees, most of whom have travelled from across Africa and the Middle East. </p> <p>The debate over illegal immigration has become a major political issue in Italy. It flared again this week when African boat people said they had thrown the bodies of 23 fellow travellers overboard after they died of dehydration and exhaustion on the 15-day Mediterranean crossing. </p> <p>One member of Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet said all would-be immigrants should be sent home rather than be allowed to land. </p> <p>As Italy urged help from the EU, Libya's foreign minister, Muhammad Abdel-Rahman Shalgham, said his country needed cooperation to tackle the problem. \"If for you Italians illegal immigration is a problem, for us it's much more - its an invasion,\" he told the Italian daily newspaper La Stampa. </p> <p>Since Tripoli decided to come out of the international wilderness and revive ties with the west, cooperation on immigration has begun. Libya has begun to police its southern borders with Chad, Niger and Sudan, with the aim of ultimately pushing the immigration frontline further south into Africa. </p> <p>But Tripoli has often complained that sanctions meant it could not acquire the necessary night vision equipment, bullet-proof border patrol vehicles, surveillance motorboats and aircraft for repatriating would-be illegal immigrants. </p> <p>Under proposals which the head of Italy's immigration police, Alessandro Pansa, will present to Libyan officials tomorrow, Italy's immigration police and other authorities would advise Libyan officials on setting up the reception centres. </p> <p>Italian officials in the past have suggested that Tripoli had deliberately \"opened the valve\" of immigrants heading for Italy to increase the pressure on Europe to lift its economic embargo. </p> <p>Now, after Colonel Gadafy's government has taken another step towards normalising its relations with the west by agreeing to pay compensation for the victims of a bombing of a Berlin nightclub in 1986, Germany is showing signs of a readiness to reciprocate. The Netherlands, which currently holds the EU's presidency, has reportedly agreed to raise the question of ending Europe's embargo on Libya at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers in September. </p> <p>Germany's interior minister, Otto Schily, who is visiting Italy today, is expected to propose that Rome and Berlin formalise bilateral agreements on cooperation with Libya. </p> <p>The two countries then hope to win the backing of their fellow European heavyweights, Britain, France and Spain. </p> <p>But Mr Schily has already met criticism in Germany for his plans. </p> <p>Members of the Green party and the former leader of the Christian Democrats, Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, are reported to have accused the interior minister of trying to create \"concentration camps on the edge of the Sahara\". </p> <p>Mr Schily has insisted that the new camps will operate in the same way as those along the EU's southern shores and would not deny would-be immigrants the right to request asylum in Italy or Germany. </p> <p>He has emphasised that the proposal is designed to help deal with an emergency. </p> <p>\"It's hard to understand why a reception centre is a reception centre when it's in Lampedusa [a tiny Italian island between Sicily and Tunisia, often the chosen destination for illegal immigrants], but when it's in Africa it becomes a concentration camp,\" the German media reported him as saying.</p>",

The last thing he's going to allow is a demo calling for better public transport in another city.</p> <p>_________________________________</p> <p>\"If you've got a big hammer you can get a lot of business at the moment,\" David Sapsford, Liverpool University's professor of applied economics, told the Northerner yesterday.</p> <p>Demolition is big business on Merseyside. Such big business, in fact, that Scousers who fled Liverpool during the long recessions of the 1970s and 1980s are being urged to return to Merseyside and take advantage of cheap property prices there. The Daily Post was understandably intrigued.</p> <p>\"Give Us Back Your Scousers\" - no, really - is appealing to expatriate Scousers who grew up or studied in the city to help fill some of the vacancies created by the city's grand scale redevelopment projects. Construction and retail firms are trying to recruit 8,000 people to work at the GBP750m Albert and King's Docks developments alone.</p> <p>\"Come back home to Liverpool,\" pleads Liverpool Needs You's website. \"Your city needs you.\"</p> <p>If knocking things down and rebuilding doesn't appeal, there are also plenty of jobs in retail. \"Skilled workers are in very short supply,\" confirmed Prof Sapsford. \"The biotechnology sector is very large at the moment and growing very rapidly.\" The expansion of Liverpool John Lennon airport has also created many new jobs.</p> <p>The city, which was once a byword for unemployment and deprivation, now has an unemployment rate of 2.9% and the fastest rate of job creation outside London. \"We're finding it increasingly difficult to fill vacancies,\" Mike Hill, the director of a Merseyside recruitment consultancy and the architect of the campaign, told the Northerner yesterday.</p> <p>Many of the emigres spent three years studying in Liverpool, but \"once they'd done a degree, they decided there weren't sufficient opportunities in the city,\" Mr Hill said.</p> <p>Liverpool's population fell by 300,000 between 1972 and 2002. In recent months, however, the city centre has undergone a minor renaissance. Property prices have risen sharply as a result, though the number of houses changing hands fell this year. Lack of housing stock and fewer first-time buyers with sufficient funds is thought to be responsible.</p> <p>An influx of skilled professionals would make things even more difficult for first-time buyers, Mr Hill admitted. \"We envisage that the vast majority of people will come from either the south-east or Manchester. If you look at house prices in Manchester or London, one of the nice things about Liverpool is that there is the opportunity to upgrade.\"</p> <p>Failure to attract enough workers, he warned, could lead to wage inflation, scupper planned developments and tip the city back into recession.</p> <p>Liverpudlians were accustomed to the notion of economic mobility, he added. Many are the descendants of families who left Ireland in the 19th century. The surge in the city's economy echoes the boom in Ireland during the 1990s, when many Britons of Irish descent headed back across the water.</p> <p>________________________________</p> <p>The Environment Agency issued scores of flood warnings and even patrolled the streets of Sheffield with a loudhailer to warn of the danger the river Sheaf would burst its banks.</p> <p>In the end, however, the river banks held; the drains didn't. A month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours over parts of the Pennines and Sheffield, leaving cars stranded in surface water.</p> <p>\"This is the third time it has happened this year, but it is the worst so far,\" a Sheffield hairdresser with a drenched carpet and flooded basement complained to the Yorkshire Post.</p> <p>The Environment Agency was unable to offer any consolation.

Unfortunately, for the Post, the directors of Cains appear to be wary of allowing amateur marine archaeologists to penetrate their brewery. \"People need to understand that the brewery site is vast and the cellars are incredibly deep and we are so busy we haven't got time to look for it,\" the joint managing director, Ajmail Dusanj, warned readers.

Maiden. \"Bryan Adams' Summer of 69, then Eye of the Tiger,\" chuckles Edward Bannister. \"Simple, and yet perfect.\" Like Elisha Cuthbert, some might say.</p> <p><strong>20th over: West Indies 62-1 (Joseph 33, Sarwan 20)</strong> Anderson turns Joseph round like the Fresh Prince and the leading edge flies just short of gully. Then another edge skims through the vacant third-slip area for four. The pressure is mounting ... so Anderson bowls a filthy delivery for four byes down the leg side. Jimmy!</p> <p><strong>21st over: West Indies 67-1</strong> Hoggard on for Flintoff and Sarwan, slashing outside off stump like Michael Myers, pings one over the top for four. \"My Welsh mate Al does an excellent Power Of Love,\" says Ian Mowat. \"After one performance he was congratulated in a beguiling manner by a young lady from our halls of residence. Smoothly, he replied with 'You're not so bad yourself, Linda'. Her name was Lindsey. Typical Al. Typical Welsh.\" I'm Welsh.</p> <p><strong>22nd over: West Indies 67-1</strong> \"Work the room,\" demands Tim Miller. \"Pick people out and sing at them, move about (or dance if you're brave), swing the mike, put your head back and belt out the hook line of the chorus. If you can get the audience to join in, all the better.\" Do you fancy being my singing coach? </p> <p><strong>23rd over: West Indies 70-1</strong> I was away in a daydreamy world of spandex, warbling, The Darkness, and cooing civil servants in that over, but I think three runs were scored. \"I would recommend 'War' by Edwin Starr, because people can't help but sing along,\" says Richard Norris. \"Try it out now - just shout: \"War, huh, what is it good for?\" I guarantee you'll be met with a chorus of 'absolutely nothing's.\" Either that or a P45.</p> <p><strong>24th over: West Indies 75-1</strong> Anderson's action is just weird - he doesn't look down the pitch when he bowls, and it resembles Paul Adams's infamous frog-in-a-blender action. \"It has come to my attention that your use of similes is like a blind man searching for a park bench after a few too many shandies,\" says Damien Ainsworth, like a man striving to use his admittedly half-decent attempt at wit as a substitute for charm and in the process get mentioned on a rambling over-by-over report and thus validate his existence.</p> <p><strong>25th over: West Indies 80-1 (Joseph 34, Sarwan 36) </strong> Flintoff back again, and Sarwan greets him with a sumptuous, on-driven four. \"Livin' on a prayer MUST always follow Eye of the Tiger,\" says Justine Ayto. \"It is the ultimate threesome.\" I'm sure it is. When added to a third song. I'm not really Welsh, by the way.</p> <p><strong>26th over: West Indies 84-1</strong> Sarwan, like an overworked auctioneer, gives it some hammer outside off stump and wellies Anderson over the top for four. Oof! \"I do remember the Feathers and would recommend 'I Will Survive',\" says Ed Gibbons. \"It gives you the opportunity to work the room and, if you're as good as me, the exit door and the route home. Alone.\"</p> <p><strong>WICKET!: West Indies 85-2 (Sarwan b Flintoff 40)</strong> It's deja vu all over again. As at Lord's, Flintoff temps Sarwan into a drag-on, driving away from his body that angled in a smidgin, and here comes Brian Lara. That was excellent stuff from Flintoff - he went around the wicket to Joseph, switched back over for Sarwan, and was immediately rewarded for his merciless flogging of this dead(ish) pitch. And now that Michael Winner ad is on to ruin a perfect moment. Bah!</p> <p><strong>27th over: West Indies 85-2</strong> \"I once had a sure-fire win in a karaoke contest snatched away from me,\" sniffs John Johnston. \"As soon as the music started I knew this bloke had it in the bag. Emotion swept the room. It was extraordinary. If you really want to bring the house down, get a fat lad to sing 'Total Eclipse of the Heart'.\"</p> <p><strong>27th over: West Indies 93-2</strong> Dropped chance! The ball after the wicket, Joseph edges an awayswinger from Anderson to Thorpe at third slip - who shells it. It looked like a bump ball, but it wasn't. Dear me, Thorpe's fielding really has gone to pieces of late. Lara, incidentally, needs seven runs - SEVEN RUNS! - to become the fourth man to make 10,000 of the blighters in Tests.</p> <p><strong>28th over: West Indies 93-2 (Joseph 39, Lara 0)</strong> Four more byes down the leg side but, before you demand Geraint Jones's head on a stick, there was nothing he could do about that. \"For sheer vocal pyrotechnics, it has to be \"Take on Me\" by A-ha,\" says Richard Burgess. \"Watch jaws drop all round as you miss the top notes.\" </p> <p><strong>WICKET! Lara b Flintoff 0 (97-3)</strong> Gottim! Lara is bowled round his legs by Flintoff in extraordinary circumstances. He got too far across and saw his leg stump clipped by a spearing yorker. From Flintoff's gleeful celebration, you'd have to think that was a deliberate ploy - Lara always gets a long way across his stumps, and it was bowled from wider on the crease. Great stuff, and what a wicket for England!</p> <p><strong>29th over: West Indies 97-3</strong> \"Why not go for Joe Satriani's 'Surfing with the Alien'?\" asks Andy Knee. \"It's the ultimate karaoke classic. Sure, there are no vocals, but a fantastic four-minute air-guitar solo is sure to bring the house down.\"</p> <p><strong>30th over: West Indies 98-3</strong> Quiet over from Hoggard to Joseph is illuminated by umpteen replays of that extraordinary dismissal. Interestingly, Lara was also bowled round his legs by England's blue-eyed allrounder on West Indies' last tour in 2000. That time it was at The Oval, the bowler was Craig White, and, even more perversely, it was from around the wicket. </p> <p><strong>31st over: West Indies 103-3</strong> \"Calm down Rob, it's a commercial,\" says Chris Hawes. \"I would go for the tactic of baffling all and sundry with a fist-pumping, power clenching rendition of Jason Donovan's I Close My Eyes.\" Like walking down Rochester High Street on a Friday night with a sign saying 'Who wants some?', it's an option.</p> <p><strong>32nd over: West Indies 107-3 (Joseph 46, Chanderpaul 2)</strong> Have some of that! Hoggard overpitches a fraction and Joseph absolutely larrups it down the ground for four.</p> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 108-4 (Joseph c Thorpe b Harmison 45)</strong> Harmison back, and with immediate effect. Joseph was worked on to the back foot, and then felt away from his body at one that bounced, left him a touch and took the edge of a crooked bat. Even more astonishingly, Thorpe at third slip held on. And yes, Joseph's score was wrong in the 32nd over.</p> <p><strong>33rd over: West Indies 108-4</strong> \"I once saw a bloke in full drag sing 'man I feel like a woman' at a karaoke night,\" says Tom Flynn. \"He certainly didn't look like one....\"</p> <p><strong>34th over: West Indies 113-4</strong> Chanderpaul, who has been West Indies' best batsman on this tour, eases Hoggard down the ground for four. Nice shot. \"Sing the Hoff,\" implores Daniel Hayes. \"Surely you should go for something penned by the slightly teutonic leather-clad egomanic American showman? He may even be walking past after a stint in 'Chicago' and immediately offer you a position on Baywatch as a 'faulty bikini designer'.\"</p> <p><strong>35th over: West Indies 118-4 (Chanderpaul 10, Bravo 4)</strong> Harmison, England's hirsute homesick hitman, marauds in and exceeds 90mph but, like a defective Yahtzee set, there's no dice. \"Since we can't see that action, perhaps at close of play we could have a Simile of The Day competition?\" says Rob Lyons, like, erm, like... \"Perhaps the prize could be two tickets to read the Guardian cricket commentary from the Oval. Or summat.\"</p> <p><strong>36th over: West Indies 122-4 (Chanderpaul 13, Bravo 5)</strong> The King of Spain, also known as Ashley Giles, gets his first bowl, and Chanderpaul lazily times him through the covers for three. That gives him the chance to have a go at Dwayne Bravo, his bunny from the first two Tests.</p> <p><strong>37th over: West Indies 126-4</strong> Perfect half-and-half length from Harmison has Bravo groping like a bearded, blindfolded non-comedian on They Think It's All Over. After two below-par Tests, he's been back to his increasingly magnificent best today. </p> <p><strong>38th over: West Indies 127-4</strong> Giles teases Bravo outside leg stump and the young lad is not comfortable at all: he thrusts his pad at everything, and one ball that pitched <em>right</em> on leg stump brings a loud shout. Only a big forward stride saved him. \"My mate saw the Hoff walking down the Strand the other day in leather trousers,\" says Tim Golby. \"Apparently he was whistling 'Wind of Change' by the Scorpions but I think that part might be an embellishment.\" A good one, mind, and one that could well rock up - as it were - in my dreams tonight.</p> <p><strong>39th over: West Indies 127-4 (Chanderpaul 15, Bravo 8)</strong> Another bruising assault of that half-and-half length from Harmison. Maiden. \"The King of what?\" asks Andrew Goldsby, in reference to over 36. I thought the story was well known. Isn't it?</p> <p><strong>40th over: West Indies 129-4 </strong>Just when I thought it was the last over before tea, I realised that we're in an elongated session because of the late start. Tea will be taken at 9pm. That's not gonna make me feel good. But this might. \"Gonna Make Ya Feel Good\" by Stefan Dennis (aka Paul Robinson from Neighbours),\" smirks Andy Gregory. \"Don a leather jacket and a moody look to top off this exquisitely emotive spectacle.\"</p> <p><strong>41st over: West Indies 134-4</strong> Shot! Bravo drives Harmison through the covers for four. \"Humour me,\" says Andrew Goldsby. \"I'm from Gloucestershire.\" OK, a horse walks into a bar...and, because of a misprint, Ashley Giles's benefit (I think) mugs were sold in the Warwickshire club shop sporting the boast: Ashley Giles, the King of Spain. </p> <p><strong>42nd over: West Indies 136-4</strong> Giles is probing, and Chanderpaul's response is to thrust his pad time and again. It's like a game of chess, only without rooks and the like. \"Has Mr Harmison re-grown his facial hair to its full effect,\" asks Alison Jeeves. \"I couldn't help noticing that he seemed to have shaved for the last Test, and that his powers weakened accordingly.\" He has indeed. Good spot.</p> <p><strong>43rd over: West Indies 138-4 (Chanderpaul 18, Bravo 16)</strong> Jimmy Anderson's back, even though there's no sign of Anne Robinson, and he nearly bowls a maiden to Bravo. Nearly. \"A mate of mine tried to get a King of Spain mug at Edgbaston on Saturday,\" says Steven McCloud. \"He was gutted to find out from the shop assistant that the story was exaggerated. According to said shop assistant only one mug was ever made! I don't want to believe it either.\"</p> <p><strong>44th over: West Indies 144-4</strong> Chanderpaul puts on his dancin' shoes and comes skipping down the track to Giles with murderous intent...before skewing a drive for two. Six off the over in all, and I'm as a tired as an over-by-over reporter's similes.</p> <p><strong>45th over: West Indies 148-4</strong> That over was quieter than a shy mouse. \"My mate Lloydy brought the house down with an stunning reworking of Holding Back the Years in an Irish pub in Hendon,\" remembers a warm-cockled Stuart Peskett. \"The bit when he tempted the audience with a measured and teasing \"holding.... holding...... holding..... HOLDING!!!! iiiiiiiii-aaaaaaa I've wasted all my years\" etc etc will live long in the memory.\" That's it: I'm singing that tonight.</p> <p><strong>46th over: West Indies 149-4</strong> This has been a good, calm recovery - especially from the perenially underrated Chanderpaul. Here's Simon Smith. \"Re: Andy Gregory's suggestion for Stefan Dennis impersonation. Simply donning the leather jacket will not cut it. The true aficionado will be well aware that, to achieve any semblance of the man's visual impact, the sleeves of said jacket will have to be rolled up to the elbow.\"</p> <p><strong>47th over: West Indies 156-4 (Chanderpaul 30, Bravo 22)</strong> Chanderpaul flashes Anderson away for four. That's tea: England \"Could you please get this classic line from Hot Shots in?\" asks Colin Rice. \"'Frankly Gregory I don't like your attitude, you'll obey orders and like it'.\" I'll be back in 20 minutes for more fun and frivolity.</p>",
  "<p>Overlooked - literally - by the 14-deck Queen Mary 2 as she slid into her berth at Pier 92 on April 22 was the dead white bird. Laid out on its funeral barge beside the USS Intrepid, as flightless and obsolete as the dodo, Concorde wasn't going anywhere. The sleek dream of supersonic speed, the princess of whoosh, the mean machine which got you there before you had started, was now, officially, a museum piece. The future belonged to the 150,000 tonnes of steel capable of grinding through the ocean at all of 30 knots (that's around 35mph to you landlubbers). The latest and most massive of transatlantic liners takes 20 times longer to carry you from New York to England than a Boeing or an Airbus. And that's the good news; the reason, in fact, for Commodore Ronald Warwick, the master of the Queen Mary 2, to brag at the quayside ceremonies that Cunard was now poised to compete with the airlines for a serious share of the transatlantic business. </p> <p>Like those of us who had sailed with him through force 10 storms and 30ft swells, the commodore may have been pardonably giddy at coming through the worst the feisty spring Atlantic could throw his way on a maiden voyage, and still getting to the Statue of Liberty on schedule. But could he be right? Could this be the start of something really big and really slow? We take for granted the appeal of velocity, that there is money to be made and pleasure to be had from the gratification of the instantaneous: the three-gulp Happy Meal, the lightning download, the vital cellphone message that I am here and are you there; the soundbite homily, the febrile jump-cut, the whole damned zip-drive, wham-bam, slam-dunk, short-shelf-life, Ritalin-friendly world we have engineered. </p> <p>For much of its history, Cunard has been part of this feverish hurry-up, rather than the therapeutic slow-down. In 1907 its flagship, the Mauretania, recaptured the Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing, and kept it for 22 years. But it spurred jealous and fatal competition. In 1898 Morgan Robertson's novel, Futility, had already featured a liner named Titan, which cuts another ship in two simply \"for the sake of speed\". Fourteen years later, the captain of the Titanic was blamed for sailing full steam, in deference to the White Star Line's determination to wrest the Blue Riband from Cunard, even in an area notorious for ice floes. </p> <p>Cunard began in Nova Scotia where, following the American revolution, Abraham, who had been a Philadelphia shipwright, had settled among the loyalist diaspora. In the early 19th century Abraham and his son Samuel prospered with a small whaling fleet, built with steam-powered sawmills, and in the 1830s, watching George Stephenson's locomotive, the Rocket, hurtle along the tracks at 47mph, Samuel became convinced that on the oceans too, steam propulsion was about to replace sail. </p> <p>It was only in 1838 that the St George's Steam Company packet Sirius became the first vessel to carry both mail and 40 passengers, under steam alone, on the notoriously tough westward crossing. Immediately, the journey was cut from six weeks to two. The Sirius was followed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Great Western, which added style to speed. It boasted 128 staterooms and a 75ft saloon decorated with panels \"in the style of Watteau\", painted by a Royal Academician celebrating \"the arts and sciences\". </p> <p>Disdaining both opulence and reckless swiftness, Samuel Cunard offered something else when he and the Scottish shipbuilder Robert Napier made their tender to the Admiralty in 1839 for the conveyance of Her Majesty's Mail: dependability, guaranteed by the novel presence of an on-board engineer. In July 1840 the first of his \"packets\", the Britannia, docked at Boston after its two-week crossing. It was immediately recognised on both sides of the Atlantic as an epochal event; a conquest of space, time and history since it represented a coming-together of Britain and America after long and bitter estrangement. </p> <p>The word \"historic\" was much repeated over the public address system on April 16, as the Queen Mary 2 moved out into the Solent from its Southampton berth under a classically grey English spring sky. The maiden north Atlantic crossing had been sold out for months, and, despite the famous superstitiousness of sailors, no one aboard seems to have been deterred by, much less spoken of, the appalling tragedy that cast a shadow over the ship's prospects even before it was formally launched. On November 18 2003, while still in the St Nazaire shipyard in Brittany, a gangway collapsed, throwing 48 people 50ft to the concrete bed of the dry dock. Fifteen were killed and 26 injured, six seriously. </p> <p>There is nothing the British press likes better than taking down colossi, so the liner was dubbed \"Bloody Mary\". And those scanning the skies for signs of albatross were further rewarded (albeit much more trivially) when on an early European cruise, a malfunctioning bow thruster forced the liner to dock at Lisbon for unscheduled repairs. Irked by the carping in the press, Commodore Warwick compared the problem to something as minor as \"a garage door sticking\". \"They wrote that we limped to Southampton,\" he told me, his \"full set\" of white whiskers barely concealing his disgust. \"Limped? We were making precisely the same speed we should have made anyway!\" </p> <p>A defiantly exuberant send-off was in order. And for those braving the raw breezes there was wine on the upper deck terrace. But anxieties about the fat target of terrorist opportunity presented by all this slowly moving Anglo-American steel precluded all but a vigilantly screened handful from the dockside \"sailaway\". Massed waving of tear-stained hankies was to be seen only in the blown-up photos of Cunard's days of past glory around the ship's interior. </p> <p>And where were the cows, I wanted to know? Samuel Cunard had made sure that each of his packets was equipped with at least one ship's cow, providing a steady supply of fresh milk, which, faced with modern trays of small plastic miniatures of \"dairy-taste\" creamer on board the QM2, seems like an idea whose time should come again. There would be risks in reinstating a herd. During the maiden crossing of Brunel's immense Great Eastern in 1859, the seas were so high that, according to one report, they not only tore off the paddles but knocked over the deck-mounted cowshed, sending one of the animals through the skylight of the saloon, where it landed damagingly on an understandably surprised barfly. This might have happened early in themorning, for in the halcyon days of the early packets, saloons opened for liquor business at six in the morning and closed at 11 at night. A decent breakfast on the Britannia in the 1840s was steak and hock, which Cunard might think of adding to room service, being a more cheering way to start a day on the tossing waves than weak tea, overstewed coffee and dried-out croissant. </p> <p>What there is on the QM2 is grandeur, lashings of it: Bel-Air baroque, heavy on the upholstery and ornamentally accented lifts, in which, there being 14 decks, people spend much time. The dominant style is officially described as \"art deco\" but in fact the decor misses the angularities of true art deco and goes instead for le grand style Ginger et Fred: sweeping staircases (especially in the triple-decker main restaurant); long curved bars (very handsome in the Chart Room); leopard-spot carpets; and bronze wall bas-reliefs featuring disporting deities in the theatres, as in the pre-multiplex yesteryear. </p> <p>And even though the ship is in fact a small floating town - 2,600 passengers and 1,500 crew - it seldom feels crowded. It helps, of course, if you have a cool \u00a314,500 to spare, for then you get a share of the Balmoral Suite - 2,249sq ft of what the brochure describes as \"sheer extravagance\", including a dining area for eight; interactive plasma screen television (two); your own exercise equipment; and (the least they could do, really) \"a fully stocked bar\". For something like \u00a310,600 less, you rate a less than fully stocked bar, and about 250sq ft of elegant, if rather narrow, cabin and balcony. </p> <p>Though the best thing about a week's Atlantic crossing is an eyeful and a day-full of nothing other than the rhythm of the sea and the silvery curving rim of the world, and although old Cunarder hands insisted that was the way that crossings, rather than mere vulgar cruises, should be, Cunard is now owned by the mother of all cruise companies, Carnival Corporation. And the job description of their toiling entertainment directors begins with the abhorrence of vacuum. So the gym rumbles with massed treadmilling; the Canyon Ranch spa is packed with heavy massaging; the herbal sauna is crammed with oversized marine mammals (bipedal) who, when packed together about the sweaty ceramic tiles, gave new meaning to the term aromatherapy. In front of the two huge ship's theatres, passengers line up by the neo-Nazi statuary to hear a glamorous string trio of Ukrainian musicians dressed in miles of retro-ballgown satin taffeta give their all to Jealousy; or to watch spirited young British actors throw themselves into greatest hits from Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer's Night's Dream, or even listen to the likes of lecturers such as me pontificating about Atlantic history. </p> <p>In the Queen's Room, a frighteningly accurate bust of the actual Queen Mary, the present Queen's grandmother, surveys Gavin and Lydia, the dance teachers, as they steer giggly novices through the baby steps of samba, cha-cha or foxtrot, the \"walk-walk, side-together side\" contending with the unhelpful motion of the waves. On the parquet, middle-aged \"gentlemen hosts\" hired by Cunard to squire single ladies through the dances glide their partners around with courtly grace. </p> <p>Nothing aboard the ship, though, gets as much exercise as the jaws. Indeed, devoted chowhounds could spend the waking hours of the entire six-day voyage doing nothing but grazing the vessel, bow to stern, since, as the ship proudly boasts, there is somewhere to eat something, 23 out of 24 hours. From the swaying gait of the heavy tonnage billowing through the dining room towards the end of the voyage, it seemed as though some at least were taking full advantage of the offer. Not surprisingly, things British are done best. If fish and chips with mushy peas is your idea of spa food (and why not?), you will not be disappointed at the ship's pub. And come four o'clock, the Winter Garden is packed with tea parties gobbling perfectly trimmed cucumber sandwiches made of the regulation-issue pallid white bread triangles, while a tristful harpist completes recollections of rainy afternoons trapped in British seaside palm courts. Imperial nostalgia (or aversion) is further heightened on noticing that pretty much everyone being served is white, while most of those doing the serving are not. </p> <p>The best food on board is probably to be had at the Chef's Galley where, in the style of a live celebrity chef TV programme, a group of a dozen or so diners were talked through the preparation of the meal by Sean, an exuberantly wisecracking chef. About halfway through preparing the mango and crab salad, things started to get exciting in a Quentin Tarantino kind of way. Sean capped his demo about the importance of having really sharp knives by gashing his thumb. Later, while he was merrily blowtorching the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Sean was asked about the problems of keeping the cookware from having a mind of its own in heavy weather, and was about to offer a breezy reply when the answer came, instead, and suddenly, from the phantom guest, who had been there all along; the Atlantic ocean lifted us all up in its big catspaw and unceremoniously set us down again. </p> <p>Old man Poseidon, evidently assisted by Tritons with serious attitude, was crashing the scene. On the Beaufort wind scale of one to 12, this one, howling around the ship like a marine banshee, was a 10, eventually getting up to 70 miles an hour, not far short of hurricane force. Likewise, the motion of the sea is measured by a range going from \"moderate\" through \"rough\" to \"high\", the latter being well beyond a mere \"very rough\". That night and much of the following day our particular piece of the Atlantic was \"very high\", beyond which the only available term is \"phenomenal\", by which time your cabin is probably filling with water and men in tuxedos are ushering women and children to the boats. </p> <p>As the mango and crab salad and I became unhappily reacquainted, the gale certainly seemed to be turning phenomenal. Everything that could fall in the cabin did so, including us. The Queen Mary seemed now to be locked in a frenzied dance with the elements (not at all Gavin and Lydia style), the ship reaching and rising and then on the crest of the churned water going into a wicked shimmy, its sides shaking and jangling like a belly-dancer before sinking back voluptuously into the trough. </p> <p>The next morning, the sea was still \"very high\" but Professor Schama, due to deliver a lecture at 11.15am, was \"very low\". But I was billed to talk about my predecessor, who had given the very first lecture aboard a Cunarder, the Cambria in August 1845: the African-American author and orator, Frederick Douglass. Douglass was en route for what turned into a triumphal lecture tour of Britain and Ireland and had been befriended by the Hutchinson Family Singers (Asa, Jesse, Abby and Judson) from New Hampshire. Staunch abolitionists, the Hutchinsons had the inspired idea that Douglass might give a lecture on the iniquities of slavery, notwithstanding the fact that among the passengers were several slaveowners from Georgia and Cuba. Douglass - with mixed feelings, one suspects - agreed, subject to the permission of the captain, the famously capable Charles Judkin. Judkin, it turned out, was himself a former slaveowner (perhaps a slave trader) who had seen the light and was happy to oblige. Standing on the saloon deck, Douglass began to read from the brutal slave laws of the south when, predictably, he was drowned out by heckling and threats of physical assault from the outraged slave- owners, until Judkin called for the bosun and threatened to put the rioters in irons. The captain's gesture amazed Douglass, who began his tour of Britain with an unrealistically awestruck view of British racial tolerance. </p> <p>This was not the kind of history that usually gets narrated in shipboard lectures so duty required that, unsteady or not, I offer it to any hardy souls who had managed to lurch and stagger their way to the theatre. But was there enough left of the lecturer to get the job done? One of the sympathetic programme directors, Penny, had the answer: \"Try the injection.\" I did, and whatever was in the nurse's potent syringe not only banished the queasiness but effected a startling transformation, whimpering academic suddenly translated into an approximation of Russell Crowe in Master and Commander. Tempest? What tempest? </p> <p>And then, perforce, everything decelerated. The ship was forced to cut its speed almost in half, whereupon the stabilisers, operating by the through-flow of water, worked less efficiently, so that we too were forced to move more warily about the decks. Even the most dedicated diners were, if not entirely off their fodder, digesting it at a more ruminative pace. </p> <p>The Atlantic had definitely got our attention; its illimitable breadth, the great kick of its kinetic energy all registered viscerally in our groggy bodies. We offered it our sincere respects. Hurry, hurry? Not us, no sir. Every seat in front of the big windows was now filled with people, subdued, gawking, mesmerised, at the immense opera of the deep grey swell, the rolling and rearing waves as bulky and meaty as elephants in a temper. OK, OK, we thought, you've made your point. </p> <p>But the Atlantic wasn't taking our word for it. After a day of respite, it was at it again with another gale, less brutal than the last, but serious enough for deck-joggers to be ushered inside by the crew. But this time round, most of us had got our sea legs and had learned to respect the motion of the ocean, moving with it. Foxtrot recommenced in the Queen's Room and disco caught a new beat. For that matter, the towering ship itself seemed to be having a ball, rolling with the Atlantic punches, breezing ahead to the rough music of the wind and the swell. And as the QM2 forged along, so it became, for most of the passengers, no longer a floating resort hotel, drifting innocuously into Caribbean harbours under postcard skies. This one, we told ourselves, appropriating some of the credit for its performance, was a liner, and it was made for crossing, not cruising. \"Oh, the passengers would like it,\" said Commodore Warwick, smiling, \"if I told them that was the worst weather I'd ever sailed in, but ... \" The smile continued; the sentence didn't. He wasn't about to wreck our newfound talent for salty yarns. At the dockside celebrations in New York he conceded it had been \"turbulent\". </p> <p>When the Verrazzano bridge came looming through the gentle fog and the first tugs and pilots began to spout red, white and blue jets of water in dwarfish greeting, many of us were suddenly caught offguard by an unsuspected sense of proprietorial affection. Emotions doubled. To be sure, there was the catch in the throat as, right on cue, the morning sun picked out the Statue of Liberty and then travelled from plinth to torch with telegenic precision; there was the flood of memory, the empathy - even among the Queens' Grill high rollers - with the destitute millions who had come this way through their own storms and stresses; and the sudden jolt of recognition as we made the turn up the Hudson, that this too had been, and was still, America, perhaps the one that really mattered. </p> <p>All that, I suppose, could have been predicted. What took us by surprise, though, as we were ushered to the immigration desks set up in the ballroom by Gavin and Lydia, kitted out in their smart grey disembarkation suits, was a valedictory urge to wish the ship well, and to try to find the words to tell others who might normally opt for Newark airport and the five-hour airtube to Heathrow that they might want to give the QM2 a go; that, mirabile dictu , there were worse things than being made to sit down and fill the eyes with nothing but sky and rain and wind-whipped water as 150,000 tonnes of big ship does what it can to ride it at 30mph. In fact, there are few things better.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited version of an article that appeared first in the New Yorker</p>",
  "In a dirty alley on the outskirts of the old city of Najaf yesterday stood a crowd of militia fighters - the newest volunteer among them a bright young biology student called Ali. <p>He arrived seven days ago, bearing a Kalashnikov, a green silk bandanna and a willingness to fight for the radical Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. </p> <p>On his chest was a green ammunition belt, filled with loaded magazines and rusted hand-grenades. Written neatly on the belt was his name, address and telephone number. \"In case I die, so they can reach my family,\" he said. </p> <p>Like all of the fighters in this group on the front line, Ali, 26, came across country from Amara, one of several southern Iraqi towns where Mr Sadr's Shia militia has fought in the past week, including yesterday when British troops said 10 fighters were killed. </p> <p>Most who take up arms for the 30-year-old Mr Sadr are young and poor. A minority, like Ali, are also well educated. </p> <p>They revile Saddam Hussein, who persecuted them, but their eagerness to fight now is largely born out of frustration that the war and occupation has brought little material change to their lives. </p> <p>Added to this is their avowed religious conviction. \"I came for the defence of Islam,\" Ali said. He and the other 20 or so fighters in his platoon describe themselves as an \"Islamic resistance\". </p> <p>Ali and his colleagues spent most of yesterday taking cover in the shade. From a window in a building above them a sniper fired out a round every few minutes into the Valley of Peace cemetery, just 100 metres away. </p> <p>On the far side of the vast cemetery are 2,000 US Marines, who have threatened to seize control of the city. Last night their commander said his troops were making the \"final preparations\" for an attack, though an early onslaught was delayed at the last minute, according to the New York Times. One of Mr Sadr's associates warned that vital oil pipelines in southern Iraq would be blown up if the US attacked Najaf. </p> <p>Occasionally a US attack helicopter passed nearby and the fighters fired off rounds from their machine guns and Kalashnikovs inexpertly. There were several command wires leading out to bombs hidden in the cemetery, ready to ambush American forces when they advanced. </p> <p>The entire scene was imbued with deep religious overtones and constant references to the Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law and a key figure in the Shia sect. \"Ali is with you,\" they said to each other in greetings. </p> <p>\"Do you think I aim when I shoot this thing?\" one machine gunner said to another fighter. \"All these things are done by Imam Ali. All I have to do is carry the thing and pull the trigger and he will help me with my aim and bring down the helicopter. It is not me that does these things.\" </p> <p>The other Shia parties hold little appeal for the fighters. \"They just use Islamic slogans to cover up what they are doing,\" said Ali. \"Syed Moqtada is a nationalist and he demands the rights of the Iraqi people and the rights of the poor. He is the only one who didn't betray the people and co-operate with the Americans.\" </p> <p>The fighters here in Najaf have rallied behind Mr Sadr, the scion of a highly respected clerical family, because unlike all other leading Shia political leaders he has so far shunned involvement in the pro-American governments. Although his radicalism is rejected by many middle-class Shias, he carries a broad appeal for those looking for a revolutionary streak in the Shia faith in Iraq. It was his father's cousin, Muhammad Baqr al-Sadr, who began the activist, or \"spoken\", school in Najaf's Shia clerical community, advocating an Islamic state through revolution until he was killed in 1979. </p> <p>Moqtada's father, Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr also acquired a reputation as a social activist until he was assassinated in 1999. Since last year's invasion his son has sought to claim that activist's mantle too. </p> <p>It is an appeal that for months after last year's invasion the US and British occupation authorities seriously underestimated. Now Mr Sadr is leading his second uprising in just five months. </p> <p>For the past week Najaf, site of the holiest shrine in the Shia faith, has been the focus of fighting, but there have been clashes in Baghdad and in southern towns that have challenged the new government. </p> <p>In an acknowledgement of the sensitivity of the conflict, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, one of Iraq's two vice presidents and leader of the biggest Shia party, the Da'awa, yesterday said US troops should stop fighting in Najaf and leave the job to Iraqi se curity forces. </p> <p>The militia will be waiting - galvanised by the words of Mr Sadr, who has urged the fighters to continue even if he is killed or captured. </p> <p>Every few hours yesterday a cleric in the gold-domed Imam Ali shrine, in the heart of the old city, issued exhortations and just after 1pm the fighters pulled out sheets of cardboard, took off their ammunition belts and headscarves and knelt to pray. Then they sat in the shade, eating grapes stored over ice in a coolbox.</p>",
  "<p>10.20am newsflash from PA put up by overworked hack who's got too much to do today: England's third npower Test against West Indies was delayed this morning after heavy overnight rain left the outfield unplayable at Old Trafford. Umpires Aleem Dar and Simon Taufel made an early inspection of the playing area this morning and agreed to look again at 10.30am, the scheduled start time of the Test.</p> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> No news yet. Channel 4 are still showing highlights of the Windies tour of 2000. \"It's 10.31am by my watch,\" says Ian Johnson.&#xa0;\"Where are you?\" Steady, Ian. \"Actually, I am in a forgiving mood as I've just won a signed bat (by the England team) from The Times even though I don't remember entering their competition,\" he adds. Ashley Giles apart, has anyone else had such good fortune this summer?</p> <p><strong>10.45am:</strong> The umpires have inspected the damp patches around the wicket and decided play will start at 11.30am, with the toss at 11am. Meanwhile England have named an unchanged team, which means James Anderson starts his first Test at his home ground ahead of Simon Jones, who took five wickets for Glamorgan earlier this week.</p> <p><strong>The toss:</strong> Brian Lara wins the toss and decides to bat. Everyone agrees it's a good surface - but there are huge cracks on the pitch already. Ashley Giles must be licking his lips as we speak.</p> <p><strong>11.10am:</strong> West Indies have made - count 'em - four changes to their side. Sylvester Joseph makes his debut in preference to Devon Smith, while Carlton Baugh replaces regular wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs, who has a knee injury. Meanwhile wrist-spinner Dave Mohammed comes in for Omari Banks and Fidel Edwards returns in place of Jermaine Lawson, who has a side strain.</p> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> The players stride on to the strains of Jerusalem and we're about to start. \"I picked up a side strain playing cricket yesterday,\" moans Richard O'Hagan. \"I used to think it was a fairly wimpy sort of injury to have, but it actually hurts more than any of the many broken fingers I've received over the years.\" So now you know.</p> <p><strong>1st over: West Indies 0-0 (Gayle 0, Joseph 0)</strong></p> <p>Decent first over from Hoggard, who makes Gayle play and miss twice. \"Thank God the cricket's back,\" says Grace from London. \"Because there is no one in my office and currently the only thing keeping me occupied is colouring in my olympics wallchart.\" Well [over-by-over report dons marketing hat on], there's always our brilliant new <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/fantasychairman\">Fantasy Chairman game</a>, our <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/thegear/story/0,12490,1073461,00.html\">Greatest Internet Sports games section</a>. Or the cricket, of course.</p> <p><strong>2nd over: West Indies 3-0 (Gayle 0, Joseph 3)</strong></p> <p>Joseph gets off the mark with a smart prod through mid on, but then Harmison subjects him to the sort of going over rarely seen outside Friday nights in Luton. \"I've got tickets to the Friday of the Oval Test next week....but need ideas for an 'hilarious' fancy dress for 10 strapping gents that is guaranteed to get us on the telly,\" says Craig Finbow. Anyone?</p> <p><strong>3rd over: West Indies 9-0 (Gayle 5, Joseph 4)</strong></p> <p>Shot from Gayle! He rocks back like a World Strongest Man contender under the weight of a particularly heavy boulder before slashing a shot through the covers for four. No wonder Hoggard is shaking his head in disbelief.</p> <p><strong>4th over: West Indies 9-0 (Gayle 5, Joseph 4)</strong></p> <p>More fiery bowling from Harmison, who tests Gayle with one that jags up sharply and raps him on the elbow. He does windmills like a e-numbered addled schoolboy at a family wedding, delaying play, before he's beaten by one that shoots past him at 91mph.</p> <p>Meanwhile David Vayro isn't happy. \"When it rains in Manchester there's a soft southern tendency to arch an eyebrow and say 'well it always rains up there',\" he fumes. \"On the other hand when there are minor floods etc in and around the home counties the same people are practically begging the UN to send food parcels.\" He has a point, mind...</p> <p><strong>WICKET 5th over: Gayle c Vaughan b Hoggard 5 (West Indies 10-1)</strong></p> <p>Hoggard strikes! Having been roughed up by Harmison, Gayle slices nervously at a short-of-a-length Hoggard delivery and finds Vaughan at point. Meanwhile your fancy dress tips are flying in. \"We've Jimmy Saville'd it for about six years now,\" says Andrew Gledhill. \"It's a licence to get away with all kinds of behaviour and you can lead the ground in choruses of ba baba - Jim'll fix it for you.&#xa0;Although the shell suits get a bit hot in the groin area.\"</p> <p><strong>6th over: West Indies 12-1 (Joseph 7, Sarwan 0)</strong></p> <p>Harmison is thundering in - there's two deliveries over 90mph that over - but Joseph hangs on. After two indifferent Tests England's No1 pace bowler is looking back to his best. \"Why not dress up as cricket spectators,\" suggests John McClure. \"That should make you stand out from the masses of Elvis-impersonating Flintstone Gladiator Firemen.\"</p> <p><strong>7th over: West Indies 12-1 (Joseph 7, Sarwan 0)</strong></p> <p>The pitch is swinging more than a jive band in 1930s Harlem - and it's got more pace than the first two Tests too. No wonder Sarwan is rightly watchful as Hoggard picks up a maiden. \"We're going to the Oval on the Sunday, and are toying with the idea of despots,\" says Angus Saunders. \"Stalin carrying six pints of Fosters? Pinochet signalling a four? Pure class.\" If you say so Angus.</p> <p><strong>8th over: West Indies 20-1 (Joseph 12, Sarwan 3)</strong></p> <p>Not such a good over that from Harmison, who is picked off like a grape at a French winery. Meanwhile Simon Boniwell is doing his bit for north-south relations. \"I agree with David, the south-east wets itself (no pun intended) at the first hint of a bit flooding. Pansies.\" </p> <p><strong>9th over: West Indies 22-1 (Joseph 14, Sarwan 3)</strong><br></p> <p>More decent bowling from Hoggard, more cautious blocking from the Windies batters. \"Why don't Craig and his mates go as a group of highly talented and extremely well-motivated West Indian cricketers?\" asks Chris Plant. \"That's bound to stand out just because of the rarity value.\"</p> <p><strong>10th over: West Indies 24-1 (Joseph 14, Sarwan 5)</strong><br></p> <p>Two appeals in a row from England! First there's a huge roar from Ashley Giles, who mistakenly claims a catch after Joseph fends off a yorker. Then Harmison gets one to lift, and it brushes Joseph's shoulder on the way through to Jones. But both times Simon Taufel makes the right decision: not out.</p> <p><strong>11th over: West Indies 31-1 (Joseph 18, Sarwan 8)</strong><br></p> <p>That's more like it! Joseph, who only averages 30 in first class cricket, rocks back before pulling Hoggard for four. Meanwhile, more on the north v south debate. \"Southerners seem to think that whatever's happening in London is the same as everywhere else,\" fumes Tom Hopkin. \"A couple of puddles on the Strand and there's flooding 'across the country', a second ice age sets in in Yorkshire and there are some 'reports of localised ise patches'. That's the London media for you, Tom...</p> <p><strong>12th over: West Indies 36-1 (Joseph 18, Sarwan 13)</strong><br></p> <p>Now Sarwan gets in on the act! Harmison decides to throw in a bouncer, but Sarwan is onto it in a flash and smashes it through midwicket. And, would you believe it, the sun is beginning to come out.</p> <p><strong>13th over: West Indies 37-1 (Joseph 18, Sarwan 14)</strong><br></p> <p>To huge, appreciative cheers, Flintoff replaces Hoggard. His first over is lively enough, but is easily fended off by Sarwan. \"Pah, the only reason the northeners don't worry when it rains is because they know they will float better than us leaner southeners,\" reckons Andy Darley.</p> <p><strong>14th over: West Indies 38-1 (Joseph 18, Sarwan 15)</strong><br></p> <p>\"That's over and lunch!\" Umpire Simon Taufel calls time on an very interesting session. The ball certainly moved around early on, but with the sun out and the pitch now looking about as lively as Blackpool in November, Brian Lara will hope his team can push on after lunch.</p> <p>LUNCH:</p>",

  "For the past four years, Victor Malarek has immersed himself in the world of pimps, traffickers, rapists and some of the most disenfranchised women and girls in the world. One of Canada's leading investigative journalists, he is the author of a new book about the global sex trade, The Natashas, a harsh introduction into a business that causes uncalculated misery to hundreds of thousands of young women. <p>The title refers to the generic name given by customers to the women and girls trafficked across international borders every year; the US state department currently puts this figure at around 900,000, most of them from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Malarek estimates that trafficking in women generates about $12bn (\u00a36.6bn) a year, making it the third largest money-making venture in the world, after trafficking in weapons and drugs. </p> <p>Malarek's book takes us to auctions in Bosnia, where women are displayed naked on wooden crates to be poked and prodded like livestock. He hears stories of rape, abuse and torture on a shocking scale. But he avoids repeating what counter-trafficking activists already know, and what has been said many times before - that these women deserve our pity and compassion. There have been countless international events set up to address the issue of trafficking, but in Malarek's view the focus has been too much on the women forced into it, and not enough on the traffickers themselves, the perpetrators of the crime; there has been too much hand-wringing, and not enough action and enforcement. \"We have spent millions researching the causes,\" he says, \"and on international talking shops drawing up action plans and new legislation. But unless we implement these laws, and give police more money to investigate and prosecute the pimps, we will get nowhere.\" </p> <p>The Natashas is an angry, impassioned book, for which Malarek makes no apologies. He describes the people who buy and sell women as \"low-life criminals\", \"gutter trash\" and \"heartless goons\". He does not make a distinction between \"forced\" and \"chosen\" prostitution - as many campaigners in the field do - but outlines the human rights abuses evident in the sex industry per se. He also identifies customers as a large part of the problem. \"Let's look at how societies can discourage men from buying these women,\" he says, \"which would reduce the supply. Some people justify prostitution by saying, 'It's the world's oldest profession.' I say there are ways to stop this. Trafficking is an easy crime to solve. If I can find the brothels and traffickers, so can the police. Just look in the tabloid personal advertisements for a start.\" These men are not looking for relationships, he says. \"They want sex with a faceless female. Those who use trafficked women want to pretend that they are not like their sisters, mothers or partners.\" </p> <p>Born in Lachine, Quebec, in 1948, Malarek was taken into care when he was nine, and grew up in a children's home. Before that, he regularly witnessed his father beat his mother in fits of drunken rage. As a teenager, he spent time in juvenile correction centres for petty crimes, but then decided to turn his life around and got a job as a copy boy on a Montreal magazine. </p> <p>A front-page story for the Montreal Star in 1971 about the suicide of three boys in a Canadian correction centre launched him as a serious investigative reporter. He has since become a passionate advocate for the abused and the marginalised, writing books about Canada's immigration policy and drugs trade, as well as hosting a television documentary series, The Fifth Estate. \"As a writer, I have always relied on my gut,\" he says. \"If I feel a story is important, I will go all out to expose it.\" </p> <p>When Malarek began research for The Natashas in 2000, journalists in Canada and elsewhere were by and large uninterested in the subject. \"I would see stories coming in through the wires about the abduction and mass rape of Moldovan, Russian and Bosnian girls, but no one was following them up. I decided it was something I could not ignore,\" he says. </p> <p>Focusing mainly on trafficking from the former Soviet Republic, Malarek examines the role of the Russian mafia, as well as the Albanian, Israeli, Czech, Serbian, Hungarian and Ukrainian gangs involved in international pimping. He reserves his fiercest criticism for those EU countries that have gone some way toward legalising prostitution in the belief that it will alleviate illegal elements within the sex trade. Governments should come down hard on criminals, he says, not improve their working conditions. </p> <p>\"Countries like the Netherlands and Germany [which have legalised 'off-street' prostitution] should hang their heads in shame,\" he says. \"They should walk into the UN building with their flags held at half-mast for what their policies on the sex trade have done to thousands of young women. Traffickers have been given a red carpet to walk on in those countries.\" </p> <p>His no-tolerance stance is not shared by some in the UK. Liverpool city council will seek Home Office approval for a \"managed zone\" for street prostitutes this November, and last month shortlisted two industrial estates as possible sites. The council maintains that a common area for women to work will improve their safety, as well as give them access to health and support networks; it is also popular with residents who do not want prostitution on their doorsteps. But similar zones have been established and subsequently closed down in the Netherlands because of an increase in trafficked women being brought to the area, along with high levels of violence and drug abuse. </p> <p>The Natashas also examines the complicity of some members of the international community based in the Balkans, where trafficking is a growing problem. In 2002, an employment tribunal heard how Kathryn Bolkovac, a UN police officer, had been sacked after revealing that colleagues were involved in the sexual abuse of women and young girls in Bosnia. The American security firm she worked for, DynCorp, was ordered to pay Bolkovac \u00a3110,000 in compensation for unfair dismissal, and three men concerned were fired but never charged. (The UN itself is powerless to prosecute, and it is up to member countries to take further action.) During the employment tribunal, the court heard that one of the men had bought a young girl for $700 and kept her in his apartment for sex. </p> <p>In Bosnia, Malarek met a 15-year-old girl who had been trafficked to Bosnia. \"She was the 21st birthday present for one of a [UN] platoon and was raped in turn by men with American, Canadian, British, Russian and French accents - so many she stopped counting,\" he writes. Malarek describes the traffickers' recruitment methods. An orphanage in Romania might receive a visit from \"social workers\" offering \"apprentice programmes\" for adolescent girls. The girls are taken away and forced into prostitution. </p> <p>Much of Malarek's anger focuses on the annual US state department Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, which grades countries with a trafficking problem according to three tiers. Nations fully compliant with the minimum standards in combatting trafficking are graded tier one, while those unwilling and unable to counter the problem are graded tier three. The UK is in tier one, but there are those who believe - Malarek among them - that the grading system is merely another strategy adopted by the US to reward its allies. </p> <p>\"The TIP report was designed to stop the traffickers operating with impunity,\" he says. \"It was supposed to be about having the courage and vision to take a firm and even bold stand. It was supposed to be about leadership and accountability. But despite all the hoopla and sabre rattling, the US has degraded the process to little more than a diplomatic game.\" </p> <p>Earlier this week, protesters in Bangladesh (graded a tier-three country) argued that the report was a means of pressurising the government into deploying troops in Iraq, and only criminalised the poor. \"Poverty is the main cause of human trafficking and the US should look into it,\" said a spokesperson for the Bangladesh Citizens Alliance Against Trafficking . </p> <p>Despite its TIP status, the UK does not have a strong track record in prosecuting traffickers, with the few cases that are brought being investigated mainly by the Metropolitan police. Even with the new legislation introduced through the Sex Offences Act, which has increased the penalty for human trafficking to a maximum of 14 years, traffickers are scarcely deterred by the force of the law. </p> <p>In December last year, Luan Plakici, an Albanian, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for trafficking up to 60 young women from south-eastern Europe into the UK; he was also convicted on counts of incitement to rape, living on prostitution and kidnap. When the sentence was passed, there were gasps of disbelief from police and anti-trafficking activists at the judge's leniency. </p> <p>The court of appeal later increased the sentence to 24 years. \"Ten years is no deterrent,\" says Malarek. \"Traffickers see it as an occupational hazard to go to jail every now and again. What hurts is when you seize their assets - take everything they have and give it back to the women they've abused and the police so they can track more of them down.\" </p> <p>Does he think the situation has got worse? \"There are no new crimes of this nature; just different ways of getting away with them.\" Malarek accuses the UK, and other countries that have thriving sex industries, of turning a blind eye. \"Tolerance is worse than legalisation in a way. It means we can ignore the fact that some countries provide a safe haven for pimps rather than think of a solution. I would say to the UK, 'Legalise prostitution at your peril'. It would be a red light for pimps to operate with impunity, knowing vice is out of the police's hands.\" </p> <p>The Natashas can seem like a hopeless story, the scale of the problem is so vast. But Malarek is not pessimistic. \"What we need is for governments to say, 'Stop this, and stop it now'. I have a daughter, and would do anything I could to prevent her going into the sex trade. I'm proud of this book, and hope to hell it makes a difference. If it prevents just one life being ruined, then it will have been worth it.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Natashas: The New Global Sex Trade, by Victor Malarek, is published today by Vision, \u00a310.99</p>",

  "<p>Legend of Zelda, Pac-Man (NES Classic Series)<br> GBA, \u00a314.99 Nintendo, <br> ***** </p> <p> You could never accuse Nintendo of not milking every drop of its back catalogue. The latest wheeze, designed for the summer holidays, is the release of some \"classic\" games from the 80s. Originally realised on Nintendo's NES system, these relics are proof that not everything retro is cool. </p> <p>The range includes the best-forgotten Xevious and Ice Climber. If you are curious to see what games were like when Duran Duran were huge, then try Pac-Man and the Legend of Zelda instead. The former needs no introduction and is an excellent conversion of what remains a uniquely addictive munch-em-up. The main problem is that you can get perfectly adequate phone versions of Pac-Man substantially cheaper. Unless you have the urge to play on the bigger screen of a Game Boy Advance, it makes sense to go mobile. </p> <p>More relevant is The Legend of Zelda, the first in the venerable series and a far more interesting proposition. It is testament to the original design that this is still highly playable and uses a template that subsequent Zelda games have built on. Players guide elfin adventurer Link around a massive world, as he fights monsters, solves puzzles and rescues the Princess. Progression is drip fed by item retrieval, as previously unreachable destinations - such as islands or mountains - become accessible with newly found objects. Despite the raw graphics, Legend of Zelda is worthy of the title \"classic\". <br> <strong> Greg Howson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2</strong><br> PC, \u00a334.99 1c/Codemasters, <br> **** </p> <p> First of all, a warning: Soldiers is hard. No, I don't mean challenging, I mean 60 minutes spent trying to get past the first 60 seconds of the first level - which puts paid to the game's loftier claims of realism. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, liberating Europe in the mid 40s was hard but storming the German frontlines using only one tank and a Jeep (as you have to do in the very first mission) is so unrealistic you get the feeling the developers are cheating on their own rule book. Of course, you play it at Novice level, but no one likes owning up to incompetence, do they? </p> <p>Which is a pity, because in other respects Soldiers takes wargaming to new levels of complexity and detail. With 30 large missions, split across German, Russian and Allied campaigns, everything you might expect from a quality RTS is here minus the resources. Most of the buildings can be occupied, all of them destroyed, and you have hundreds of authentic weapons and units to do it with. </p> <p>You also get a choice of playing modes, allowing you to use standard RTS mouselicks or press the spacebar to take direct control of any unit, moving while firing to negotiate some of the trickier sections. </p> <p>This (and the attention to detail) creates unique situations and challenges - for instance, searching for a petrol container under heavy fire so you can refuel a sitting duck tank - all unknown territory to wargamers. </p> <p>So, although Soldiers is not a perfect game, most of its problems could be solved by a patch, and what's left is another impressive Codemasters assault on yet another new genre. <br> <strong> Mike Anderiesz</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow</strong><br> Xbox, \u00a319.99 Ubi Soft,<br> **** </p> <p> Last year, team-based shooter Rainbow Six 3 was the poster boy of Xbox Live, its exhilarating multiplayer online mode making foamy-mouthed anti-terrorist nutters of us all. Unfortunately, the single-player experience was dull, and bugs did their best to sabotage the online fun. So while we're waiting for RS4, this generously proportioned, standalone update fixes all the minor RS3 grievances and adds some excellent new features. </p> <p>For the lone player, there are 10 new missions, built around a zeitgeisty terror plot involving war among oil-rich Black Sea states. It's the usual mix of tense corridor roaming and huge set-piece shoot-outs, with you commanding three AI troops as you move through industrial silos and crumbling back streets. </p> <p>As with previous Rainbow Six titles, the door opening mechanism dominates the action: should you just open it, or perhaps throw in a flash grenade, or - oh, what the hell - lob an explosive charge in, too? </p> <p>The enemy AI is slightly improved, and there's a split-screen, two-player mode for those who want cooperative thrills without the inconvenience of having broadband installed. </p> <p>But Rainbow Six 3 is really about multiplayer, and this must-try element has been re-balanced and re-tuned to near-perfection. New maps, new weapons and new Xbox Live 3.0 features (including lots of well-thought-out clan functionality) make Black Arrow an essential. </p> <p>In short, if you haven't navigated a downtown ambush with a 32-year-old Texan covering your back, and a teenage sniper from Calais scouting ahead, you haven't experienced online gaming. <br> Keith Stuart</p>",
  "Appe al court judges yesterday defied human rights campaigners by ruling that British courts could use evidence extracted under torture, as long as British agents were not complicit in the abuse. <p>In a highly controversial judgment, the second highest court in the land rejected the appeals of 10 men suspected of having links to international terrorism and currently held without charge in what activists call \"Britain's Guant\u00e1namo Bay\". </p> <p>The court of appeal, sitting in London, ruled that the home secretary was right to hold the men in two high- security prisons and a high- security psychiatric hospital, and that the special immigration appeal commission (Siac), which backed the internments, was justified in doing so. </p> <p>Two of the men have since returned to their countries of origin but are still appealing. </p> <p>The judgment was immediately condemned as leaving the door open for torture evidence to be used in British courts - and the detainees plan to take their appeal to the House of Lords. </p> <p>Last night Amnesty International criticised the judges for giving a \"green light for torture\". It said: \"The rule of law and human rights have become casualties of the measures taken in the aftermath of September 11. This judgment is an aberration, morally and legally.\" </p> <p>The decision comes just a week after three British men formerly held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay described how after ill treatment they had confessed to meeting up with Osama bin Laden when in fact all three had alibis, confirmed by British security services, that they were in the UK at the time. </p> <p>Ellie Smith, a human rights lawyer at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said: \"It is really dangerous and very worrying that any court is willing to use any evidence that has been obtained through use of torture or ill treatment.\" </p> <p>The decision to allow evidence from foreign torture was tantamount to contracting out the torture. \"We have seen recent instances where the US forces have sent people to other countries for the purpose of extracting evidence,\" she added. </p> <p>The men - all of them foreign nationals and Muslim - are detained indefinitely under the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 and do not know most of the evidence against them because it is kept secret in the interests of national security. </p> <p>In their appeals, they argued that to use evidence obtained by torture was \"morally repugnant\", adding that evidence may have been extracted from men detained in both Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Yesterday, one of the judges, Lord Justice Laws, ruled that there was no evidence to suggest the secretary of state had relied on material derived from torture or any other violation of the European convention on human rights. To suggest that it had been was \"purely hypothetical\". He and Lord Justice Pill said that torture evidence could be used in a British court so long as the state had not itself \"procured\" it or \"connived\" at it. </p> <p>The position facing the secretary of state on the use of such evidence was \"extremely problematic\". The law could not expect the secretary of state to inquire into the methods of how information was obtained. </p> <p>Mr Justice Laws said: \"He [the home secretary] may be presented with information of great potential importance, where there is, let us say, a suspicion as to the means by which, in another jurisdiction, it has been obtained? What is he to do?\" </p> <p>The judges unanimously dismissed the appeal but Lord Justice Neuberger dissented on the torture issue. He said he did not consider that a person would have a fair trial if evidence obtained through maltreatment was to be used, particularly since the person giving the statement would not be available for cross-examination. </p> <p>The majority decision was welcomed by the home secretary, David Blunkett. He said: \"There has been a great deal of speculation about the cases put before Siac and whether they relied upon torture. Let me make it clear, we unreservedly condemn the use of torture and have worked hard with our international partners to eradicate this practice. However, it would be irresponsible not to take appropriate account of any information that could help protect national security and public safety.\" </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, solicitor for eight of the men, said: \"This is a terrifying judgment. It shows we have completely lost our way in this country, morally and legally.\" </p> <p>Britain is a signatory to the European convention on human rights which enshrines a series of fundamental rights, including \"freedom from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment\". </p> <p>Facilitating torture elsewhere is also illegal under the convention against torture to which the UK is committed. </p> <p>The lawyer for two other men, Natalia Garcia, said that human rights had become \"a casualty of the so-called war on terror\". She added: \"We have sunk to an all-time low where a court can even contemplate that evidence obtained under torture could be admissible and where there is no attempt to provide any effective remedy against abuse of power. </p> <p>\"This is injustice heaped upon injustice and we shall appeal to the House of Lords.\" </p>",
  "Michael Howard has raised the stakes in his race with the government for headlines praising toughness on crime (Howard turns clock back, August 11). But Martin Kettle (Comment, August 10) rightly warns of the impact on the civil legal aid budget of the clampdown on crime. It is time for the prime minister to take the heat out of this debate and return to his promise to be tough not just on crime but on the causes of crime. <p>Simply creating new offences will not achieve that, but the increasing cost of criminal legal aid will squeeze the civil legal aid budget (so reducing access to justice) and further disadvantage those whose lives are most affected by criminal activity. The government has launched a review of legal aid. We hope this will be used to find ways to mobilise the whole of the justice system to help tackle the causes of crime in the most vulnerable communities.<br> <b>Janet Paraskeva</b><br> Chief executive, Law Society  We are pleased Martin Kettle has injected some balance into the reporting of legal-aid issues and pointed out that the creation of more criminal and asylum offences, not asylum seekers themselves, causes a drain on legal aid funding. An example of this is the latest legislation under which an asylum seeker can be prosecuted if the immigration service believes s/he has destroyed their papers. Given that, for many fleeing war zones and persecution, stopping to apply for a passport is not a priority, we would not be surprised if prosecutions arising out of such cases resulted in more claims on legal aid. </p> <p>The growing complexity of asylum law also creates the demand. It is now virtually impossible for an asylum seeker to conduct their claim without a lawyer. In addition, the poor quality of decision-making in immigration cases in the first instance results in many more applicant appeals. <br> <b>Tauhid Pasha</b><br> Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants  With crime at its lowest level for 20 years, the last thing that we need is to build new prisons or to scrap electronic tagging. If politicians are serious about cutting crime and making communities safer, they should be basing policy on evidence about what works. Instead of locking yet more people up we need investment in measures to prevent children getting into trouble, expansion of mediation schemes which can resolve neighbourhood disputes, better treatment for offenders with mental-health problems and greater availability of drug treatment both inside and outside of the criminal justice system.  <b>Joe Levenson</b><br> Rethinking Crime and Punishment</p>",
  "<p>Over the next couple of years, hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses and other NHS staff will be vetted, photographed and issued with smart cards. No, it's not the national identity card programme, though the exercise may provide useful logistical lessons. This procedure is to ensure that the NHS knows exactly who is logging onto a countrywide system of electronic medical records under the \u00a36bn NHS National Programme for IT. </p> <p>The new system's security is under severe scrutiny. The British Medical Association is urging doctors to boycott the new Care Records Service because of fears that it will damage medical confidentiality. Privacy International, a pressure group, last month named the programme \"most appalling project\" in its annual Big Brother Awards. </p> <p>Documents seen by the Guardian suggest that the NHS is planning extraordinary efforts to protect access. Whether the measures are workable remains to be seen. </p> <p>The documents, marked \"NHS confidential\", set out procedures for verifying doctors' identities and managing the issue of smart cards and digital keys. These will be needed to use any IT system connected to the new data \"spine\", which will transmit patients' medical and social care records and allow appointments to be booked electronically. The spine's access-control systems are based on an existing system, the Government Gateway, which routes data between Whitehall departments. </p> <p>To issue the new IDs to 80,000 doctors and many more nurses and other healthcare professional staff, the NHS proposes creating a network of registration authorities reaching into every hospital and surgery. </p> <p>The principle is that everyone issued with a key will be personally vouched for by an authorised sponsor who is confident of their identity. This must be done through face-to-face meetings. After filling in a form called RA01 (which comes with three pages of terms and conditions in small print), the applicant has to provide a current passport or driving licence and a set of \"community\" identities to prove address. Nationals of non-EU countries should show that their passports contain \"either UK stamps, a visa, or UK residence permits showing the immigration status of the holder in the UK\". All records of registration authorities have to be kept for 25 years. </p> <p>Interestingly, there is no mention of a biometric check, such as a fingerprint or iris scan. This is probably because the NHS is waiting to see what procedures are decided for the national ID card. </p> <p>Successful applicants will get smart cards with a user ID generated by the NHS and their own password. The card specifies the user's place in a three-tier hierarchy of privileges. If doctors forget their password or lose their cards, the registration authority has to \"arrange a suitable face-to-face meeting\" where the sponsor can verify their identity. </p> <p>The new routine will have to be put in place within months, before the first production release of the spine goes live. (A prototype, called Phase One Release One is currently being tested.) NHS IT chiefs hope that the procedures will convince sceptics that an electronic system is more secure, as well as deterring members of the public from attempting to impersonate hospital staff. </p> <p>An authoritative survey of doctors' opinions suggests there is some way to go. It finds that, although a majority of doctors support the programme, levels of enthusiasm are declining. The survey, by Medix, a specialist medical polling organisation, put questions to a sample of 852 doctors. Three quarters said they expect electronic records to improve clinical care. On the controversial question of whether patients should opt in or opt out of the national system, there was overwhelming support for the NHS's plan that records should be automatically included unless patients opt out. </p> <p>However, the survey, the fourth of its kind, found that only 54% of respondents were enthusiastic about the programme, a fall from 65% in the previous survey. A common complaint was lack of consultation: 40% said they had received no information. Three quarters of GPs agreed that they should not use electronic records until the BMA's concerns about the system are met. </p> <p>In response to such concerns, the national programme is stepping up a hearts and minds campaign to promote the new technology. \"We recognise that important issues have been raised and that we should respond openly and constructively,\" a spokesman says. </p> <p>To involve patients' representatives, the programme is recruiting a Care Record Development Board to \"inform the work\" of the national programme. According to the recruitment pack, the board will \"identify major issues and create short-term action groups to address them through appropriate consultation.\" Applicants must be members or organisations, health or IT professionals or managers of an organisation \"providing health or social care services\". </p> <p>The spokesman says that the programme, until now notorious for its secrecy, would be adopting a higher profile. \"We have also recently started a programme of meetings with the media and other stakeholders. We will build the momentum.\"</p>",
  "It is a long and depressing route from being a member of parliament to living in a flat in a Glasgow towerblock you are too afraid to leave after dark. To the group of swaggering young guys gathered outside - dressed in the familiar uniform of Burberry caps and shellsuits - Okwiri Rabwoni is just an easy target for their racist bile. They know nothing of his story. <p>Mr Rabwoni is an asylum seeker in Glasgow; another victim of what a sheriff described this week as an \"epidemic\" of racist attacks. Sentencing eight teenagers for a vicious and unprovoked attack on a group of Iranian men, Michael Grady QC made it clear it was not the first time he'd had to deal with such crimes. </p> <p>\"People come to this country seeking refuge and support, but they end up victims of crimes committed for nothing more than sport,\" he said. \"It is recreational racism. Time and time again, I hear of these incidents.\" </p> <p>Mr Rabwoni knows all too well their reality. There are the petty comments that he brushes off but does not want his wife or daughter to hear. \"They say 'black bastard' and such things, but nothing I have not heard before many times,\" he says. But then there are the more pernicious, and more serious, attacks. </p> <p>\"They trapped my wife in the callbox outside, would not let her out. It was very frightening for her. Now I do not like her to go to even the lifts alone,\" he says. </p> <p>And then there was the time the young guys threw a bottle at Mr Rabwoni. \"I was visiting a friend, it was daylight, three o'clock in the afternoon,\" he says. \"They were young men in a group of about eight, aged maybe 17 or 18. They said, 'When are you going back home?' and such things. Then they threw the bottle. It was a very big injury. I needed to go to hospital. I told the police and they took a statement, wrote down what happened. But then, nothing.\" </p> <p>A softly spoken, articulate man, Mr Rabwoni is no stranger to conflict. He was a major in the Ugandan army, fighting in Congo, a child soldier from the age of 14. Latterly, he was a member of the Ugandan parliament, forced out of the country after he supported the wrong candidate in a presidential campaign. </p> <p>\"Yes, I have seen fighting,\" he says. \"But I do not want to do such things here.\" </p> <p>Since the first wave of asylum seekers were sent to Glasgow's sink estates three years ago under the Home Office dispersal programme, they have struggled to integrate into their host communities. </p> <p>Most tragically, a Kurdish man, Firsat Dag, was murdered in an unprovoked attack in Sighthill. Though no racial motivation was found, Mr Dag's murder sparked racial tension in the city and, eventually, moves by many bodies to calm the situation. But how successful have these attempts been? </p> <p>Strathclyde police's most up-to-date figures, for 2003-04, reveal a 13% rise in the number of racist attacks in the city. They do not, as yet, have any figures available for the number of attacks on refugees and asylum seekers, but a report by the charity Positive Action in Housing said 175 refugees living in Glasgow had been attacked in the previous year, a rise of 75% on the year before. </p> <p>\"Asylum seekers tend to be targeted because they stand out: they may have different-coloured skin, speak in a different way, dress in a different way,\" says Chief Superintendent Alex MacDonald, Strathclyde police's asylum seeker liaison officer. </p> <p>\"But I'm not sure there is a hard core of racist offenders out there targeting asylum seekers. I think there is a hardcore group of persistent offenders who are preying on the vulnerable.\" </p> <p>Outside the shops in Pollokshaws, where asylum seekers have been integrated with less obvious trouble than other areas of the city, there is some dispute over Mr MacDonald's opinions. </p> <p>\"It is hard to be African in this city,\" says a woman who gives her name only as Patience. \"Other people may also be frightened by these people, but if they are saying you are a black this it must be racism. Is that not true, my friends?\" </p> <p>An elderly lady, Margaret, agrees. \"It's racist, hen, of course it is,\" she says. \"But they would be at you if you had a limp or if you had red hair or were old or whatever. They've made our lives a misery for years. Now they've got you lot to pick on.\" </p> <p>Behind the shops, a group of young guys are smoking. They won't give their names. \"If they don't like it here, they can fuck off back home, can't they?\" says one. </p> <p>The Scottish Refugee Council says it is the sort of comment asylum seekers, in a city which has a small ethnic minority population beyond its Asian and Chinese residents, face regularly. \"We want to make it clear that it is not the majority of Scottish people who feel or act this way,\" a spokesman says. \"But there are a group of people who do. They should be targeted by the law - and the rest of us should try to make sure asylum seekers don't think the whole country is like that.\"</p>",
  "The art of lobbying is being perfected this week in the modernist marble interior of the Hilton hotel in Athens. The city's magnificent Olympic stadium may be the focus of the world's attention when the games of the 28th Olympiad open tomorrow night, but the Hilton will be the real heart of the games. <p>The hotel provides not only a temporary home for the 123 members of the International Olympic Committee, the body that administers the self-styled \"greatest show on earth\", but is also the venue for the deal-making and politicking that drives the Olympic movement. </p> <p>Crucially for London, Paris, New York, Madrid and Moscow, the lobby of the hotel is also the battlefield where by stealth and sleight of hand the right to stage the 2012 summer games could be won or lost. </p> <p>For the past week the elegantly dressed, permanently tanned and predominantly middle-aged mix of businessmen, potentates, minor royalty and entrepreneurs who make up the IOC's membership have been visible in and around the Hilton. The hotel is the IOC's luxury barracks and its administrative heart - the capital of the state-within-a-state that the Olympic movement has established in Athens. </p> <p>Staging the games requires the host country to comply with a number of extraordinary regulations, chief among them the suspension of normal immigration controls. For the duration of the games an Olympic accreditation document grants its holder the same privileges as a visa, effectively gifting the IOC sovereignty over one of the state's most important functions. </p> <p>Nowhere is this temporary power more apparent than in the scores of army, police and security personnel that surround the Hilton, minutely checking the accreditation of anyone intending to pass between the fountains that flank the hotel's revolving door and into the air-conditioned heart of the games. </p> <p>The hotel was block-booked nearly six years ago when Athens was awarded the Olympics, and it is clear why, being both a short limousine ride from the stadium and superbly appointed. The suites occupied by IOC members are the height of luxury and the view from the rooftop Galaxy bar is the best in Athens, taking in the Acropolis, the harbour at Piraeus and the islands beyond. </p> <p>It is inside, however, that the real business is done. For the cities bidding to host the 2012 games the opportunity to access the entire IOC membership is one they cannot afford to miss. As London's bid is fast discovering, it is a world in which perception can mean more than reality, and every advantage must be made to count. </p> <p>Yesterday the leaderships of the London, Paris and New York bids were working the hotel's prestigious guests with a determination worthy of any of the medal hopes honing their preparations in the athletes' village. After the bribery scandal that followed the awarding of the 2002 winter Olympics to Salt Lake City, candidates are bound by strict regulations limiting the scale and nature of contacts with the IOC members who decide the venues. </p> <p>Bid members are prevented from even buying an IOC member a drink, and officially cities are not allowed to \"actively campaign\" until after November 15, when their candidature files have been handed to the IOC. </p> <p>This has not stopped the five candidates for 2012 under- taking an intensive if discreet lobbying process. Dan Doctoroff, the CEO of the New York bid, said: \"It's a great opportunity for us to get at the members of the IOC and many more members of the Olympic family. It is the only chance between now and the vote in Singapore when it will happen. Our contacts are informal, open and it's a great opportunity to establish relationships.\" </p> <p>For London's bid, damaged by changes of leadership and a Panorama expos\u00e9 unfairly linked to the bid team, their efforts this week could be crucial to their chances of success. Lord Coe, the bid chairman, will be based at the Hilton - he spent yesterday, along with the chief executive, Keith Mills, working hard to find favour with IOC members dismayed at Panorama allegations of widespread corruption within the Olympic movement. </p> <p>Lord Coe, who also addressed a session of the IOC's commission last night, said he was encouraged by the response since arriving on Tuesday. \"I've had very positive feedback so far,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I've spoken to a great many members of the IOC today and only a few have mentioned Panorama, and we have made it clear that we are here and available to talk to them about the allegations if they want us.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Feherty, once a European tour player, now a star commentator on United States television, was unequivocal about the challenge presented this week in the US PGA Championship. \"If the wind blows,\" he said, \"they may not finish this thing before the Masters starts next April.\" </p> <p>That is an exaggeration, of course, but indicative of the general feeling that, if there is anything other than sunny days and balmy breezes, the biggest winner this week will be the golf course. Whistling Straits, a Pete Dye creation, has been called \"dye-abolical\". It is certainly golf-course architecture in an extreme form. </p> <p>It would be very easy, even for the best players in the world, to set up the course so that it would be to all practical purposes impossible. From some of the back tees there are forced carries that not even the longest hitters would make every time. There is also rough so penal that finding one's ball might be the worst option on offer, and there are possible pin placements that require such accuracy that in reality no one would aim at them. </p> <p>As Sergio Garcia said, with some emphasis: \"If you don't hit it straight here, you are dead.\" But it is not just straight that counts. Yesterday, playing the 500-yard 18th, a par-four that features a 260-yard carry over a collection of 27 bunkers and acres of waist-high grass, Vijay Singh, one of the longest hitters in the world, needed three attempts to reach the fairway on his chosen line. </p> <p>From his final attempt he still needed a four-iron second: had he chosen a safer shorter line off the tee he would have needed a fairway wood to reach the green. </p> <p>Colin Montgomerie, though, did not think the 18th was that much of a problem. \"It's a par-five, isn't it?\" he said dismissively. </p> <p>Montgomerie considered the 12th and 17th holes, both par-threes, as the most demanding. Both feature elevated greens, with Lake Michigan awaiting the mis-directed tee shot on the right and then the left respectively. At both holes it needs only a fractional misjudgment and an automatic bogey would be the result, with options available on double and even treble bogey. </p> <p>At the 12th yesterday a brief stop behind the green saw three groups go for the pin set on a peninsula reaching out towards the lake. Ten players made a total of 18 attempts at that pin, and only three balls landed and remained on the putting surface. </p> <p>Montgomerie pointed out that there was an enormous bail-out area of green to the left of the peninsula but conceded that to land there would mean an almost certain three-putt. The 17th is 223 yards long. To the left is a steep 60ft drop off to the lake, to the right a 20ft pulpit bunker staring at the water. In between there may be 18 yards of green at which to aim. </p> <p>The average hacker would be advised to play it with two wedges, except that the land between tee and green is a crater-strewn wilderness. A signpost to the right of the 17th green gives the spectators advice on the best way to various places and it includes a finger pointing in the direction of Cruden Bay, on Scotland's east coast, 3,711 miles away. That course was part of the inspiration for Whistling Straits, according to the owner Herb Kohler, but in reality there is no resemblance. </p> <p>Never before have so many ball-spotters been employed at a major championship and never before have they been so valuable or so exercised, so extreme is this course. </p> <p>The first-time visitor, despite the ever-present danger of breaking a leg - four people did on Monday - on the severe hills and hummocks, is drawn further and further into fantasy land, just to see what more in the way of atrocities Dye can inflict. </p> <p>On a nice day it is undeniably beautiful, just as is a siren on the rocks, and it will require a rare combination of skill and patience to avoid coming to grief. </p> <p>Ernie Els, of course, possesses those two qualities in abundance and, with one round to go in each of this year's three majors, he has been the favourite to win. He was outplayed by Phil Mickelson at the US Masters and had no answer to the stupidities inflicted by the US PGA on Shinnecock Hills at the US Open. </p> <p>He failed to impose himself on the Open at Troon, missing a nine-footer for the championship, of which he said yesterday: \"I'll think about that putt for as long as I play the game.\" </p> <p>He will not want any more memories of that sort and this week he starts as the 6-1 favourite, a point shorter than Tiger Woods and two shorter than Phil Mickelson. Throw Singh into that equation and these are the men best equipped to cope with demands never before made in championship golf. </p> <p><strong>Course card</strong></p> <p><strong> Hole Par Yards Hole Par Yards </strong></p> <p><strong> 1</strong> 4 408 <strong> 10</strong> 4 361 </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> 5 593 <strong> 11</strong> 5 318 </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> 3 181 <strong> 12</strong> 3 143 </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> 4 493 <strong> 13</strong> 4 404 </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> 5 598 <strong> 14</strong> 4 373 </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> 4 355 <strong> 15</strong> 4 518 </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> 3 221 <strong> 16</strong> 5 563 </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> 4 507 <strong> 17</strong> 3 223 </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> 4 449 <strong> 18</strong> 4 500 </p> <p><strong> Out</strong> 36 3,805 <strong> In</strong> 36 3,709 </p> <p><strong> Total</strong> 72 7,514</p>"
