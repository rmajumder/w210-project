  "<p>Food is a very important part of Insley family holidays. If we're not actually eating, we're usually thinking about what we can have next and wondering how long we will have to wait for it. </p> <p>So I approached a holiday in Kenya with some trepidation. Reading the Lonely Planet guide, it seemed we'd be living on tough meat stews and curries served up with stodgy starch fillers. 'They'll fill you up, but it's really just survival food ... vegetarians will really struggle as meat features in almost every dish.' Oh dear. My daughter, Imogen, has pretty eclectic tastes, but gristly meat stews do not feature high on her list of must-eats. She's not that keen on fish either - she's the only seven-year-old I know who hates fish fingers - so I wondered how she would fare on Lamu, a piscatorially rich island off Kenya's northern coast. </p> <p>I hadn't allowed for the cuisine at Peponi, our hotel on Lamu. Arriving by dhow from the tiny airstrip on the neighbouring island of Manda, we were ushered to the shady veranda overlooking the channel between the two islands, offered fresh fruit juice and asked to address the serious business of choosing what we wanted for dinner that night. </p> <p>As soon as I saw the menu I realised this was going to be the biggest decision every day on Lamu. Should I go for the tuna carpaccio or a hot, spicy mangrove crab? Bajias - a Swahili dish that looks like chicken nuggets but is made of beans - served with a hot sour sauce, or samaki wa kupaka, a whole grilled fish basted in spices and coconut cream? </p> <p>I opted for grilled lobster, while Imogen settled on ham and pineapple pizza - not such the cop-out it sounds, as the pizza was homemade with large chunks of fresh fruit. </p> <p>The next day we watched as a large washing basket of big prawns was carried off the beach into the hotel. That night I had piri piri prawns fried quickly in their shell with marsala, garlic and lime juice. Exquisite. Imogen had spaghetti bolognese with a garden salad. Then we started working our way through the ice cream and sorbets: lime, mango, banana, passion fruit, and a rich vanilla and chocolate variety that actually tasted of chocolate. </p> <p>Perhaps the culinary highlight of the week was a Swahili dish of crisp vegetarian samosas, prawns cooked in spices, coconut cream and tamarind, chapati and halva, a local Turkish delight that tasted of cardamom. The best thing about the meal was the setting: a table above the pool, overlooking the beach. Candles along the path and set into the wall lit our approach and shone romantically over the food. (Shame I was sharing it with a seven-year-old.) </p> <p>There are other things to do on Lamu apart from eat, as long as you approach them in a relaxed way. The Kenyan coast has long been the last port of call for people who have been on safari - a chance to extend the suntan beyond face and arms and to chill out after pursuing wildlife from dawn to dusk. Indeed, Lamu has turned relaxation into an art form. </p> <p>If relatively few British people have heard about the place it could be because the Kenyans keep quiet about it. It's too special to share with a load of Europeans and Americans, although a select few - including Princess Caroline of Monaco, who owns three houses in Shela village, where Peponi is sited - have been let in on the secret. </p> <p>The island was first colonised more than 1,000 years ago, when Arabs and Persians began settling on the African coast, and although building is still going on in Lamu town and Shela, it's all in keeping with the beautiful stone houses and mosques built by the merchants of Oman in the 18th century. </p> <p>The word Swahili comes from the Arab word Sahil, which means coast, and is said to have originated in the Lamu area. The whole island has changed very little over the centuries - there are no cars, and therefore no roads. Everyone gets around by dhow or donkey - there is one donkey for every two people on the island. </p> <p>We strolled (no one does anything faster here) along the eight miles of empty white sand that extend from the walls of Peponi, picking up fragile sand dollars. We fed breakfast scraps to the Egyptian-looking cats that live alongside donkeys and fishermen, had henna tattoos applied by a woman on the beach, and took a dhow ride to Manda to swim around the coral pools in search of huge shiny cowries. </p> <p>Imogen played at being shipwrecked with her new friend, Marcella, collecting fallen coconuts for their food store. I snoozed on one of the sumptuous swinging sunbeds while Imogen splashed in the pool, shaded from the fierce sun by three fat baobab trees. Social life - very much of a laid-back, decadent, colonial kind - revolves around the Peponi bar, and the hotel owner, Lars Korschen (think of a young Bill Nighy in Love Actually mode), is usually nearby. </p> <p>Peponi runs a dhow from the hotel to Lamu town every morning and foreigners are asked to wear long trousers and sleeves so as not to offend the islanders, who are predominantly Muslim, many of the women wearing full purdah. With our guide, Abdullah, we wandered the narrow alleys, peeking past ornate Moorish doors into dark interiors. En route he took us to visit his pals: a silversmith, a woodcarver, a man who ran a general store which sold just the basket Imogen was hankering after. A guest-house owner let us look inside a traditional Swahili house. From the outside it looked shabby, but inside was beautiful etched plaster, with niches (vedaka) set into the wall to show off the occupants' prized belongings. Each house has its own well, and the kitchen is on the roof so smoke doesn't ruin the plasterwork. </p> <p>Over the next few days we walked, swam and sailed with Abdullah, and sometimes with his son, Sultan. The thing we both wanted desperately to do, but which couldn't be fixed by Abdullah, was to spot a green turtle. Carol Korschen, Lars's wife, runs a turtle-protection scheme, buying the huge adults sometimes caught by fishermen to release them back into the sea. As they are tender and tasty, a delicacy prized by locals, this is not cheap. She also pays a family on Manda to protect turtle nests, subsidising her costs by taking hotel guests to see the young hatching. </p> <p>We set off at 6.30am. Most of the baby turtles had appeared during the night, but a few were still struggling to the surface and slithering down the dune to the surf below. They were tiny - about three inches long - and surprisingly soft. Some still had yolk sacks attached to their bellies which, Carol told us, would have to be absorbed before they entered the water or they would be weighed down and drown. </p> <p>That afternoon Sultan took us fishing with hand lines on his father's dhow. While I succeeded only in feeding large, succulent prawns to whatever was out there, Imogen caught two white snapper, a black snapper, something with spots and a rather attractive parrot fish. Sultan gutted and descaled the fish over the side of the boat, insisting I take one back for my supper. I had been planning to revisit the piri piri prawns, but one look at Imogen's face told me that fresh fish for dinner it was. On returning to Peponi I handed over the snapper. Three hours later we were reunited with them, this time chaperoned by salad and chips. </p> <p>What a pity Imogen's moment of glory was marred: she was so exhausted that she fell asleep, head on the table, and completely missed the arrival of her excellent catch.</p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>Aardvark Safaris (01980 849160; <a href=\"http://www.aardvarksafaris.com\">www.aardvarksafaris.com</a>) has an 11-night trip in late July 2005: five nights at the Peponi Hotel on Lamu and a six-night safari (three nights at Tortilis Camp in Amboseli National Park and three nights at Wilderness Trails in Lewa Downs) cost \u00a35,495 full board for a parent and a child under 12 sharing accommodation; two parents and two under-12s in two rooms pay \u00a310, 895 full board. </p> <p>Price includes international and internal flights, activities on safari and national park fees.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday the postman brought a box of figs, six perfectly ripe fruits, olive green blushed with maroon. Thank you, Frances and Tom. I tucked into them as soon as I opened the box - soft, velvety, and ripe enough to be only just this side of jam. As welcome a gift as ever has come through my letterbox.</p> <p>Whisper the words, but it looks as if the second flush of figs in my garden is actually going to ripen. This will be the first time the fruit hasn't just sat on the branch sulking, been stolen at daybreak by bushy-tailed thieves, or simply withered away. Every day I give the fattest of the 100 a gentle squeeze, just to let them know I'm keeping an eye on them.</p> <p>When I moved in there was a splendid ficus in the garden that bore as many fruits as we could eat. Tragically, it didn't survive the redesign and I have felt guilty ever since. If there was room I'd plant even more, believing that a man can never have too many figs, but I'm running out of space.</p> <p>My two trees, a Violette de Bordeaux and a Brown Turkey, have just been joined by a tiny Petite Negri from Reads' Nursery in Norfolk. This addition to the 10 fruit trees I have planted since I came to this house promises tiny black fruits the size of a walnut. What with that and care packages from kind friends with trees more fruitful than mine, I should soon be in fig heaven.</p> <p>Most of the velvet-skinned globes that come my way are eaten at the table. These fruits deserve more than to be chomped from the hand like an apple. Often there will be a piece of cheese involved - I recommend the blues: Gorgonzola, Cashel, Stilton and almost any soft goat's cheese, especially if you mix in a little chopped thyme.</p> <p>None of this means I am not also prepared to bake a fig or two. Though the heat will give a sumptuous silkiness to the texture, the real bliss point is when you reach the seeds within. Together it is quite the most sensual mouthful (well, almost). While they don't take well to a pie, dark figs can work in place of apples in a tarte tatin; they bake beautifully in red wine and honey, taking on the colour of deepest claret; and I like them sunk into the frangipan filling of an almond tart. Just spoon the almond filling into the tart case, then push the quartered fruit down so that it is almost, but not quite, submerged.</p> <p>That is probably as far as I go with this fruit in the kitchen, though there will be salads of figs and air-dried ham, figs with chopped Kent cobs and crisp bacon, figs with mascarpone, and no doubt figs all by themselves. As I said, a guy can never have too many figs.</p> <p><strong>Fig tart</strong><br>I like my tarts to be warm, crumbly, messy and sweet. To this end, I use a very short pastry with a high proportion of butter and just treat the pastry very gently, patching it where it crumbles. To deliver perfection, I add a tart cream such a creme fraiche or a ball of ice-cold vanilla ice cream. Serves 8.</p> <p><strong>for the pastry</strong></p> <p><strong>175g cold butter<br>225g plain flour<br>2 large egg yolks<br>2 level tbsp golden caster sugar</strong></p> <p>for the filling</p> <p><strong>10 medium-sized figs<br>75g butter<br>75g golden caster sugar<br></strong></p> <p>to serve</p> <p><strong>vanilla or cinnamon ice cream, or creme fraiche</strong></p> <p>You will need a metal-handled frying pan or saute pan about 20-23cm in diameter</p> <p>To make the pastry, cut the butter into cubes, then rub it into the flour until it resembles fine, fresh breadcrumbs. Sometimes I do it by hand, other times the speed of the food processor beckons. Mix in the egg yolks and the sugar, then bring the mixture together into a ball with your hands. Wrap in greaseproof paper and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 7. Melt the butter and the sugar in a frying or saute pan over a moderate heat, stirring from time to time. When the butter and sugar look syrupy and are starting to colour, add the figs - halved and tough stems removed - cut-side down. Let them cook for 3 to 5 minutes until they are soft and starting to darken. Remove the pan from the heat.</p> <p>Roll out the pastry to make a circle a couple of centimetres larger than the frying pan. Fold the extra pastry over to make a double 'rim' around the edge. Place the pastry rim-side down on top of the figs (the best way to move this very short and crumbly pastry is to lightly wrap it around the rolling pin, then carefully lift it on to the pan). Bake for about 40 minutes until the pastry is a deep biscuit colour. Take it out of the oven and leave it to calm down a bit. Cut into slices and serve straight from the frying pan (the slices will crumble a bit) with ice cream or creme fraiche.</p> <p><strong>Figs with cashel blue</strong></p> <p><strong>3 lusciously ripe figs per person<br>a heaped tbsp Cashel, Stilton or Gorgonzola per fig<br></strong></p> <p>Cut a cross in each fig from the stem to the plump end, cutting almost through to the skin. The idea is to create a space in which to put the cheese without actually cutting the fig into four. Spoon the cheese into the hollows and eat within half an hour or so.</p> <p><strong>Baked figs with red wine and thyme</strong><br>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>12 figs<br>500ml fruity red wine<br>3 tbsp golden caster sugar<br>1 tbsp (or more to taste) thick honey<br>short-length orange peel<br>a vanilla pod<br>cloves<br></strong></p> <p>Place the wine, sugar, honey, peel, split vanilla pod and cloves in a stainless-steel saucepan and bring almost to the boil. Gently wipe the figs and place them snugly in a shallow ovenproof serving dish. (They look wonderful in earthenware.) Pour the hot wine over the figs, then bake till they are soft and full of juice (30-45 minutes). Turn the figs over and baste them during cooking. Pour the juice through a sieve back into the saucepan, bring to the boil, turn down the heat, then simmer till the liquid starts to thicken. It should end up the consistency of thin syrup. Pour the syrup over the figs and chill before serving.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The middle-aged woman sprawled on the ground in front of me, in her black dress and perilous night-out heels, will definitely have a headache in the morning. She'll deny it was the booze of course, however much she has had, just as her son will deny it was the booze that caused him to tumble backwards into her as he was ejected from the pub for being drunk and unruly, so that her head hit the pavement with a dead clunk. He'll continue to insist the doormen assaulted him, even though the police have already checked the CCTV footage and satisfied themselves they did nothing of the sort. <p>It is the Saturday night of the August Bank Holiday weekend, and in the pedestrianised heart of Basingstoke, a tidy shopping street punctuated by vast neon-clad drinking halls, the Hampshire constabulary are busy policing the night-time economy. They call an ambulance for the mother, tell the son to calm down and take a cab to the hospital. They disperse the drink-sodden crowd that has gathered to watch. </p> <p>If you don't include the two drunks with stab wounds (thought to be self-inflicted) who were dealt with earlier on, and the 'yellow cards' issued for anti-social behaviour - pissing in doorways, shouting abuse in the street - this is the first major incident of the night. There's more to come, though. A little while later we get reports of an unprovoked attack. We find the victim perched on the kerb just down from Market Square nursing a bleeding cut to the brow that will need a stitch or two. 'This bloke came from nowhere,' says his friend. 'He was really drunk, he was. He said, \"You're lucky I didn't take your face off, you bald bastard\".' Steve still has it in him to smile at the reference to his prematurely bald pate. Another cluster of police. Another ambulance. Later still there's a third incident: a drunken brawl in the street, one woman stamping on the head of another. 'Remarkable,' says the officer who just happened by. 'She lifted up her foot and down it came.' </p> <p>But the really remarkable thing about all this, the really troubling thing, is that, according to the Basingstoke police, it is 'a quiet night'. Although they would like me to think it was down to smart policing - which partly it is - they also know it's the luck of the draw. 'Last night was hectic,' another officer says to me. 'We had two colleagues assaulted, punch-ups, the works.' This, they say, is the reality of binge drinking in Britain today. 'Town centres used to be butcher, baker, pub,' PC Mark O'Hanlon says. 'But now there are big out-of-town supermarkets, so the butchers and the bakers become pubs too, and huge ones at that.' In come the promotions: the two-for-one deals, the rock-bottom discounts on pints, the drink-all-you-like-for-\u00a320 offers. And the police are the ones who have to clean up the mess. </p> <p>Britain keeps going out on the piss. Tony Blair has labelled binge drinking - generally defined as necking twice the recommended daily number of units, four for men, three for women - as 'a new British disease'. For once this does not appear to be spin. The statistics speak for themselves: each year 14 million working days are lost due to alcohol abuse. Half of all violent crime - around 1.2m incidents a year - is attributed to binge drinking. At weekends 70 per cent of all admissions toA&amp;E are the result of boozing. A study just released found that two-thirds of all ambulance calls on Friday and Saturday nights in London are alcohol related, costing the service nearly \u00a320m. Bingeing accounts for 40 per cent of all drinking occasions among men and 22 per cent among women and the numbers are rising all the time, particularly in the 18 to 24-year-old group. </p> <p>'It's a major problem,' says Stephen Green, Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire, and spokesman for the Asso ciation of Chief Police Officers on the issue. 'I would put it second only to gun crime and drugs. Alcohol drives all violent crime, except that associated with guns. The obvious side is the alcohol-fuelled disorder outside of pubs and such like,' he says. 'But equally, so much domestic violence and racist violence is attributed to alcohol too.' We're not just drunk, he says. We're drunk and angry, out of it and up for it. </p> <p>How did we get like this? Why is Britain the binge-drinking champion of Europe? Other nations, the French and the Italians for example, drink more than us but it's spread out across the week. The Scandinavians are famous for their bingeing, but they do it less regularly than us. Only the British get furiously intoxicated every week. The answer, according to the experts, lies in a curious set of legal and social changes unique to this country, going back over almost two decades. </p> <p>'First you have the death of the traditional manufacturing industries and the chronic drinking culture that went with it,' says Stephen Green. 'Blokes going down the pub for a pint or two after work. As the factories closed down, that came to an end, which hit the profitability of the drinks industry.' That, he says, was compounded in 1989 by the decision of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to end the tied system, whereby the breweries owned the pubs that sold their products. Back then, all the breweries had to do to sell booze was unlock the pub doors. Now they had to market themselves. 'The chain of accountability between pub and brewery was gone,' Green says. 'I'm sure it made sense in terms of trade but in terms of the selling of a dangerous drug it was a disaster.' </p> <p>The final part of the jigsaw came direct from youth culture and the rave scene. The restaurateur Oliver Peyton, who made his first fortune importing hip alcohol brands Sapporo beer and Absolut vodka, saw it first hand as a club promoter. 'People on the scene just didn't drink alcohol,' he says. 'They had their pills and a bottle of water and they were happy.' Alcohol sales plummeted. 'I believe the industry then decided they needed to come up with products that would appeal directly to that lost demographic.' Green agrees. 'There was a deliberate decision by the breweries not to compete with each other but to compete with ecstasy and water.' </p> <p>Naturally, the drinks industry will never admit such a thing, but the chronology is more than convincing. In June 1995, just as rave culture was breathing its last and more alcohol-friendly cocaine was becoming the drug of choice, Bass launched Hooper's Hooch, an alcoholic lemonade, beating Merrydown's Two Dogs into the market place by a month. In September of that year Thornlodge came up with Mrs Puckers alcoholic lemonade drink which was followed in December by Lemonhead from Carlsberg-Tetley. The following year United Distillers launched Sweet, a whisky-based version of Irn-Bru, Bass diversified into orange-and blackcurrant-flavoured versions of Hooper's Hooch and Whitbread joined the scrum with Shotts. The age of the alcopop was upon us, and in12 months sales tripled. </p> <p>'Learning to drink used to be a rite of passage,' says Richard Phillips, chief executive of the charity Alcohol Concern. 'It was something you had to work at because there weren't drinks targeted at you. There was a pathway from childhood to adulthood which made it a stepped experience.' </p> <p>In other words, booze tasted pretty nasty and you had to acquire a taste for it, or face the embarrassment of ordering a snowball - Advocaat and lemonade, the 13-year-old girls' favourite - at the bar. But you didn't have to acquire a taste for Two Dogs or Lemonhead. Outside Phillips's office, spread across the top of some dusty filing cabinets, is their collection of alcopops: drinks with names such as Thickhead and Buzz. There's banana-flavoured Super Milch and Dr Thirsty's Strong Orange Punch and something worrying called Beetlejuice. None of these is less than 4.9 per cent alcohol and some of them - Strong Cider Shock, sold in a lightbulb-shaped bottle, or TNT, which looks like a stick of dynamite - are 8.4 per cent. </p> <p>'The number of young people getting drunk has doubled in the last 10 to 15 years,' Phillips says, 'And in epidemiological terms that's huge.' Again, the industry has long denied alcopops were being marketed to the under-18s and point to the warnings on every bottle (though, in 1997, a newspaper investigation caught brewery executives admitting exactly that). But underage drinking, outside of pubs and bars, is still a huge problem. Basingstoke police have recently been issued with bottle-openers so that if they catch under-18s down the park with bottles - usually WKD, Bacardi Breezer, and Smirnoff Ice - they can open them and pour the booze away. </p> <p>Meanwhile that first generation of alcopops drinkers are now the ones thronging the new-style drinking halls on Britain's high streets: the branches of Yates, Hogshead and Wetherspoons that have filled the high-street gaps left by those traditional shops moving out. Between 1997 and 2003, the capacity of Nottingham's licensed premises jumped from 65,000 people to 110,000. 'That, says Stephen Green, wearily, 'is a massive increase in capacity.' </p> <p>If you want to get to grips with the realities of binge drinking take a look at Chris Greenhaugh's face: the circular scar on his nostril, the half-moon shape across his cheek. Better still take a look at the photographs of his nose before his recent reconstructive surgery to repair the massive damage done when part of his nose was bitten off during a drunken brawl. 'It was six years back,' says Chris, a 29-year-old bus driver from Hackney in north London. 'I'd gone out for a drink with some mates to a nightclub in Mile End.' It was moderate drinking, he says. Just the five pints. They went for a kebab and then down to a minicab office to get a ride home. 'We're waiting for our cab and these four blokes come in,' he says. 'They're very mouthy to everyone.' Words were said and then it went off. 'There were two of them on me. I got a punch in the head, then somebody bit my nose. I just thought it was bleeding.' He stumbled to a toilet at the back of the office. 'I looked in the mirror and realised that a chunk of my nose was missing.' The blokes that did it, he says, 'were seriously tanked up, up for trouble'. And then he says: 'Britain's got a problem with the booze. You go into bars and clubs and immediately you see it, people pissed and up for fights.' </p> <p>Chris's nose was saved by the facial surgeon Iain Hutchison. In the late Nineties Hutchison and colleagues conducted research into how many of the facial injuries seen by accident and emergency departments were alcohol related. They calculated that it was responsible for around 125,000 serious facial injuries a year - caused either by falling over, other accidents or assaults - at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds a year to the NHS. Through the charity he founded, Saving Faces, Hutchison has gone into schools to warn teenagers that binge drinking doesn't just lead to an almighty hangover. 'Facial scarring is something you carry around for life,' he says. 'And that message can be a good way to discourage people. The message is: save your face. Drink sensibly and slowly.' </p> <p>I ask him what things the government can or should be doing. 'The problem with politicians,' says Hutchison, 'is that they want quick results. But this is not something that can be solved quickly. It requires cultural change. Too often this government has looked like it's thrashing around looking for a solution.' It is hard to disagree. In 1996, the year before New Labour came to power, the Portman Group introduced a voluntary code of conduct on the naming, packaging and merchandising of alcoholic drinks, designed to deal with the excesses of the alcopops craze. The code has been updated twice since then and, for the most part, the government has seemed content to let the industry continue regulating itself. </p> <p>In 1998 the Department of Health was charged with framing an alcohol harm reduction strategy, but failed to do so. In July 2002, it was announced that Downing Street's strategy unit would now be looking at the issue. Eventually, in March of this year, six years after it was first mooted, the strategy was published. It was a collection of good intentions and unarguable commitments, backed up by few targets, no statute and precious little money. 'We currently spend \u00a395m on alcohol-harm treatment in this country,' Richard Phillips says. As Alcohol Concern has pointed out, Smirnoff Vodka spent two-and-a-half times as much to rebrand itself recently. </p> <p>The tragedy is that there are ways to make a difference. The accident and emergency unit of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, has shown that, if you can identify binge drinkers as they come in for treatment, you can then deliver advice which, coming from a health professional, has an impact. 'GPs' contracts have just been renegotiated,' says Phillips. 'They could have made alcohol harm reduction work part of the contract, as they did in the past with smoking reduction. They didn't do so. It was a missed opportunity.' </p> <p>At exactly the same time as the alcohol harm reduction strategy was being devised, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport was also working on a new licensing act, which would sweep away the statutory 11am to 11pm licensing hours. The Licensing Act 2003 has been portrayed in the media as paving the way for a 24-hour drinking culture. It won't, but it will result in change. Instead of there being set drinking times, local authorities will now be able to decide for themselves when pubs and bars can close. They could insist that they stick on 11pm - or let them go through to the small hours. It was hoped that by removing the 11pm chuck-out, we would all suddenly become relaxed southern Europeans. Out would go the desperation of last orders. The streets would not throng with beered-up boys looking for a punch up, but instead with gently tipsy young men holding clutch bags and giving their ladies roses. Or something like that. </p> <p>But, as Hutchison says, that demands long-term cultural rather than legislative change. Shortly after the act was passed in July 2003, the club and vice unit of the Metropolitan Police produced a confidential assessment of its impact upon their work. It forecast a massive leap in violent crime. 'The flashpoints that traditionally occur between 11pm and 5am may be reduced in intensity,' the report said, 'but will occur with increased frequency.' More drunks out for longer would mean more fights, more rapes, more assaults on police. </p> <p>Guidance on how to implement the licensing act was meant to be published in August of last year. Then the Met report was circulated and the brakes went on. The guidance didn't appear until this March, and the dates for the act's implementation keep being moved back. 'One suspicion is that the government hopes to move it all back far enough so that any rise in crime figures will not be seen until after the next general election,' says a source with knowledge of the process. </p> <p>'If we get it wrong and end up with a 24-hour version of what we have now,' says chief constable Green, 'The social consequences will be horrendous. You would not find an official in the Home Office who does not agree with my views and, while I do not want to speak for him, I know the Home Secretary shares them too.' There has, he says, been a cross-departmental fudge between the Home Office, which is responsible for policing the night-time economy, and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which is responsible for licensing it. 'When I look at what comes out of the Home Office and out of the DCMS, it's clear to me they are not working together.' (Despite repeated requests, the government failed to put forward a minister to comment.) </p> <p>In the meantime the onus goes back on to the industry where, eager not to be regulated by statute, the two great buzz words are now 'social responsibility'. Even a drinks behemoth such as Diageo - producers of every thing from Baileys and Bell's whisky to Red Stripe and Smirnoff - has its 'social responsibility' unit. I ask its head, Kate Blakely, why. 'People want to feel good about working here at Diageo,' she says. 'And being socially responsible is part of that.' But isn't it just a marketing position? 'That's highly cynical. I think people here genuinely care about the health of industry and the health of the consumer.' </p> <p>Ah, yes, the consumers. What do they think? Time to return to the heart of binge-drinking Britain, this time to Bridge Street in Guildford, a 100-metre stretch clustered with huge drinking halls, each one thumping with music, and offering cheap drink deals. There's a Yates and a Wetherspoons, a Bar Med and a Bar Zuka and a club fittingly called 'The Drink'. In Edwards, another uberpub with a dedicated shots bar and pitchers of Malibu cocktail at \u00a37, I find Gareth. He's cheery and a little pissed - but not as pissed as he's going to be. 'I'll probably have about 10 bottles of beer tonight and a couple of pints.' I wonder how many units that is. 'About 25 to 30,' he says. He manages a pub so he knows. I point out that the weekly limit for men is 28 units. He shrugs. 'I can have a good time if I drink five pints or 10 pints. Basically everybody here is going to get out of control. That's what this is about.' </p> <p>Standing with him is his mate, Mark. 'I work my arse off from Monday to Friday as an engineer in the petrochemical business and during the week I don't want to go out,' he says. 'So on Friday nights I'm going to have some beers. I'm going to have 10 or 11 beers.' But how do you feel on Saturday morning? He laughs. 'I feel like shit, but I don't have to go to work. Yes I may be damaging myself, but that's my right.' </p> <p>And then there's their friend, Vicky. Nice, sensible-looking Vicky who manages a sports shop and who has had the day off. She has been drinking since lunchtime, and is clutching a bucket-glass of red wine which she admits is 'seriously rank'. How many has she had? 'I don't know. I think I've drunk myself sober.' How would she respond to the government which says her behaviour is dangerous? </p> <p>She leans forward and shouts at my notebook: 'I would say, \"Fuck off.\" I work hard and I want to play hard.' </p> <p>And there, in that statement, is the debate on binge drinking distilled. The doctors, the ministers and the police may see it as an argument about violent crime, facial scars and anti-social behaviours. But for Britain's binge drinkers themselves it's not about any of this. It's about a spanking good night out, and nothing else.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Gaucho Grill, 89 Sloane Avenue, London SW3 (020 7584 9901). Meal for two, including wine and service, \u00a390</strong></p> <p>How can one restaurant do some things so well and others so badly? How can the branch of the Gaucho Grill on London's Sloane Avenue, which prepared for me a superlative steak, also serve up as a starter the exercise in gastronomic illiteracy that is the carpaccio ceviche? Let's take this dish apart. The carpaccio, invented at Harry's Bar in Venice, was designed for a countess on a diet of uncooked meat, and made a virtue of the very best beef fillet, served thinly sliced and raw. As anybody who has ever eaten a really good carpaccio will know, the flavour of quality raw beef, while divine, is also never more than subtle.</p> <p>Ceviche is a method of 'cooking' animal proteins, usually fish, using the acid in the juices of citrus fruit, combined with various butch spices and seasonings. A good ceviche is a thing of beauty, ditto a good carpaccio. But a combination of the two? It's a nonsense. Sure, the beef may be best Argentinian fillet, but that doesn't make it a reasonable thing for an Argentinian restaurant like the Gaucho Grill to do. The ceviche part of the dish destroys any flavour in the carpaccio part. At which point I hear the spirited sound of raspberries being blown in my direction by one Douglas Rodriguez.</p> <p>In New York, Rodriguez is a star. He is chef at the highly regarded Patria and founding father of the Nuevo Latino movement, an attempt to update the cooking of Latin America. He is the co-author of The Great Ceviche Book and, for the past few months, consultant chef at the Gaucho Grill. As he wrote the book, I suppose I ought to bend the knee, but after tasting that dish I can't quite bring myself to do so. I suspect I'd feel better about it if I wasn't also underwhelmed by our other starter, oysters BLT: oysters baked in a horseradish sauce with bacon and a tomato salsa. That's an awful lot of ingredients to foist upon a dear little oyster.</p> <p>At least there were those steaks. An Argentinian restaurant that can't do a good steak is a like a trapeze artist who's afraid of heights. But in London, where a prime piece of grilled cow bum is an appallingly rare joy, we should big up the places that deliver. At the Gaucho Grill they come in a handful of cuts and sizes, topping out at 400g, and they really do use the best Argentinian beef. My sirloin, a very reasonable \u00a317 for the top size, was a little under-trimmed but spoke of a life lived well on the Pampas. We liked the chips that went with it, the humitas - a sweet and nutty puree of maize - and the traditional chimichurri, a sauce of fresh green herbs, chilli, oil and vinegar. There's also a strong list of rich Argentinian wines, a good number of which can be bought in half-bottle carafes. Interestingly, the steaks are the one part of the menu Rodriguez hasn't touched.</p> <p>The new menu is currently only available at a couple of branches, though it will later be rolled out to others. What, I wonder, are they trying to achieve? Argentinian food is the product of many interesting influences. It is resoundingly utilitarian, but this felt like an attempt to make it other. Granted, the surroundings are sophisticated: dark wood, cowhide-covered chairs and fancy cocktails. But that doesn't mean the menu should strain to meet it. The night I went, it felt like a song-and-dance man gagging to be cast as King Lear. It wants to be taken seriously, when, in truth, a superior steak is serious food enough.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Latino lives</strong> </p> <p>Three places to revel in a taste of the Americas</p> <p><strong>Bocanova, 90 Colston Street, Bristol (0117 929 1538)</strong><br>Brazilian-born chef proprietor Humberto Banks-Benevenuto favours a Mediterranean-style menu at this lively Bristol venue, but there are always a few dishes like moqueca (swordfish stew with coconut milk) and crabcakes made with palm oil and peppers. The superb steaks, imported from Brazil, might come with mixed leaves and tomato salsa or roasted vegetables, but 'never with chips'. On Wednesday nights, musicians play the bossa nova.</p> <p><strong>El Vergel, 8 Lant Street, London SE1 (020 7357 0057)</strong><br>You'll have to squish in with barristers from the nearby court and local design folk to eat at one long table in this brilliant - and cheap - Latin American breakfast-and-lunch place convenient for Tate Modern. Chilean Kiko Sanhueza and his partner Stella make everything from scratch, including the 'village bread' and empanadas that can be filled with churrasco (thinned slices cut from a side of Argentinian beef), salsa and chilli. Lunch, including very good coffee, costs around a fiver.</p> <p><strong>Armadillo, 41 Broadway Market, London E8 (020 7249 3633)</strong><br>Rogerio David's chic little Latino place may be out on a culinary limb in Hackney, but his New Wave pan-American cooking style draws in foodies from all over town. Roast suckling pig with onion escabeche, duck secco and fried cassava, Mayan chocolate ice cream and Mexican coffee typify the interesting combos. Argentinian steak may be enjoyed too - perhaps with the squash pancakes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sue Webster</p>",
  "<p> It has been nearly a week since the closing ceremony in Athens, but the Olympic party is still going strong in China. Celebrations for the country's record-breaking medal haul are in full swing, with athletes singing karaoke on triumphant TV specials, political leaders proclaiming a new era of national self-confidence and companies lining up for endorsements from a new generation of national heroes.</p> <p>The nation's triumphant athletes - they finished second in the medals table with 32 golds, 17 silvers and 14 bronzes - are on a victory tour that, in keeping with the sporting environment of one of the world's fastest-changing nations, is part political, part commercial and part fun. From the cheering, flag-waving crowds that greeted the athletes at Beijing airport, the country's Olympic heroes were whisked off to the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square, where President Hu Jintao said that they had become 'a strong spiritual force to push forward the national cause'. </p> <p> Last night, they took to the stage for a glitzy all-singing, all-dancing TV celebration of previously undreamt-of sporting success. Liu Xiang, the 110 metres hurdler who became China's first male Olympic track gold medal-winner, gave a karaoke rendition of the love song 'I miss you'. The country's first tennis champions, Li Ting and Sun Tiantian, who won the women's doubles, sang a duet of 'Friend' and the women's volleyball team chorused 'Sunshine After Rain'.</p> <p>Tomorrow, the victory tour heads to Hong Kong, where the athletes are being put to propaganda use. Before a crucial election next Sunday, the mainland Communist Party want to use Olympic success to foster patriotic pride and counter widespread frustrations in the territory about the slow progress of democratic reform. Among the events being planned is a rematch of the China and Hong Kong table-tennis teams who competed at the Olympics. </p> <p>And this is just the start of the politically motivated celebrations. </p> <p>Construction is in full swing for the 2008 Beijing Games, a 'coming of age' party for a country that has overcome the chaos of the cultural revolution to reclaim its place as a leading player on the world stage. In this respect, it will be similar to the 1964 Tokyo Games, which signalled the re-emergence of Japan from the ashes of the Second World War, or the 1988 Seoul Games, which announced the arrival of South Korea as a major Asian economy. Beijing has ambitious plans to trump all previous hosts by staging the most expensive Games ever. By 2007, organisers estimate that the city will have 20 new sites, including venues for such distinctly non-indigenous sports as beach volleyball. </p> <p>To ensure that visitors leave impressed, the city also plans to spend up to $40billion on upgrading its infrastructure - a bigger investment than every summer Olympics since 1984 combined. There are plans to spend $12million on thousands of new toilets, including five-star, self-cleaning techno-loos that could hardly be more different from the communal pits that are common today. </p> <p>Among the most impressive new buildings will be the 80,000-seat, $360m National Stadium, which has been nicknamed 'the bird's nest' because of its lattice of irregularly angled metal girders. The 17,000-seat National Swimming Centre is designed to resemble an ice cube suspended in thin air. </p> <p>Construction has begun on 15 of the 19 new venues, which were originally scheduled for completion in 2006. This was likely to prove so expensive, maintaining unused sites for two years, that the Beijing organisers have been told to slow down. Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, said that it was unprecedented in Olympic history to call for a delay. </p> <p>The eagerness to get everything ready so quickly reflects the huge ambitions of China for 2008. 'The Games will be a kind of vehicle to showcase China opening up,' said Wang Wei, secretary-general of the organising committee. 'China is the biggest developing country, the fastest-growing economy and the Olympics enjoy the greatest popular support in China.' </p> <p>Sport is a product of the same apparently contradictory forces that are driving China's economy forward faster than anywhere else in the world: authoritarian communist politics and cut-throat capitalist economics. </p> <p>The Olympic team are the ultimate symbol of centralised state-planning. While Britain and most other Western countries largely leave the management of sports to independent associations, China centralises power and planning in the hands of the China Sports Bureau, who are represented by a cabinet-level ministry. Their mission is clear. Just as the Soviet Union did with such effect during the Cold War, the Chinese government are pumping vast sums of money into grooming medal contenders for every sport. </p> <p>Reliable statistics are hard to come by. But, according to Li Dunhou, director of the Auditing Centre of General Administration of Sport, the bureau's budget rose more than 15 per cent last year to \u00a3150m. Part of this money goes on incentives. Athletes are given about \u00a313,500 for a gold medal, \u00a38,000 for a silver and \u00a35,500 for a bronze. In addition, many are awarded luxury homes and cash prizes from their local government and lucrative gifts from businessmen. </p> <p>Most of the state's money goes on training. Less than a decade ago, Chinese athletes competed seriously in only a few events, notably table tennis, diving, weightlifting and gymnastics. But since China was awarded the 2008 Games, the country's sports bureau has dramatically accelerated a programme to build an Olympic team capable of challenging the world's best in every field. The results are already apparent in terms of the number of competitors and their levels of success. In Sydney four years ago, China competed in only half of the events. But by Athens this year, it had athletes in 26 out of the 28 sports. By 2008, it will compete in everything. </p> <p>Even though 80 per cent of the young team made their debut in Athens - which was treated by the government as a springboard for 2008 - many showed that they have caught up with their international rivals and in a surprising number of cases have even overtaken them. </p> <p>With success at last on the track and numerous other Chinese firsts in judo, swimming and tennis, the country notched up a record high of 63 medals, a remarkable achievement for a nation that did not even participate in the modern Olympics until 1984. </p> <p>In the 20 years since, China's sporting advances have mirrored the remarkable changes in the economy. The world's big commercial sports have moved in, even motor racing. Fast cars, beautiful women and big bucks are probably the last things most people would associate with China, which is better known around the world for bicycles, pigtails and communism, but this month Shanghai will stage the country's first Formula One race. </p> <p>The foreign influence - money and coaches - is also increasingly apparent in football, which is far and away the country's most popular sport. In 2001, millions of people celebrated on the streets when the national team, then coached by the Serbian Bora Milutinovic, reached the World Cup finals for the first time. </p> <p>Every sports marketing manager wants to break into a potential market of 1.3 billion people and it seems that China is ready to give any sport a try, including bullfighting, which is beamed live from Spain once a week. Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova will play tennis in China for the first time this month and even cricket might make inroads. </p> <p>Although that most colonial of English games is now played mainly by expatriates, the government are reported to have offered land, facilities and equipment to encourage wider interest in the sport. International cricket authorities are doing their bit to raise cricket's profile through the Shanghai Sixes competition, which this year will have Viv Richards as one of its guests. </p> <p>'China is the next frontier for the game's expansion,' said Shahriar Khan, of the Asian Cricket Council. 'Coaching, funding and facilities are in place to fast-track China into playing one-day matches against other ICC associates within the next few years. The long-term objective is for China to participate in future World Cups.' </p> <p>The sponsors are also moving in, among them Kunlun, a motor-oil producer, Siemens, the German engineering firm, Sinopec, the domestic energy giant, and countless more international firms. While such commercialisation would have infuriated Chairman Mao, it is seen today as a positive boost to the economy and society. </p> <p>'China's sports have developed very quickly in the last few years. In the old days, sport was simply a function of state power, but commercialisation has brought it much closer to the people and raised the standards closer to an international level,' said Sun Baoli, a professor at the Olympic research centre of Beijing Sports University. 'The success in Athens will accelerate this trend further.' </p> <p>As with many other aspects of China's astonishing development, everything in sport seems possible, but nothing is certain. Potential party-poopers include cash problems, already hinted at by the recently announced decision to cut spending on Olympic venues, traffic problems and protests about China's record on human rights. But with four years left, there is still time to fix all these problems. </p> <p>By 2008, one thing is certain - in this fast-changing nation, sport will be unrecognisable from what it was a few short years ago.</p>"
