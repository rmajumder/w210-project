  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer yesterday agreed a \u00a32bn loan facility in order to hand back the \u00a32.3bn promised to shareholders as part of the retailer's defence against would-be bidder Philip Green last month. </p> <p>The store group also outlined its timetable for the 100p-a-share capital return. </p> <p>The \u00a32bn bank facility is in two tranches. A \u00a31.2bn loan agreement has been arranged through nine banks, including BNP Paribas, Citigroup, HSBC and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>The facility runs until August 2009 and is at a fixed rate of 0.35% over Libor, the benchmark short-term bank lending rate. </p> <p>The second tranche is a bridging loan facility of \u00a3800m, provided solely by HSBC. </p> <p>The cash will be made available to bridge any gap between M&amp;S receiving the \u00a3760m it is due from the sale of its financial services operation M&amp;S Money and returning the cash to shareholders. </p> <p>It is HSBC that is buying the credit card operation. </p> <p>The details of the tender offer, including the price range, will be revealed on September 21 and the circular to shareholders will be dispatched by September 23. </p> <p>On October 12 chief execu tive Stuart Rose will deliver his first trading update and 10 days later there will be an extraordinary meeting to approve the tender offer. </p> <p>Payments will be made to Crest accounts and cheques dispatched on October 29. The group's half-year results will be unveiled on November 4. </p> <p>M&amp;S must now decide how to price the tender offer - a method chosen to shake loose the short-term punters who have no interest in waiting to see if Mr Rose can achieve the turnaround he has promised. </p> <p>A price range will be offered and investors will want the highest possible price. It has to be higher than the market price or shareholders would sell in the market. </p> <p>M&amp;S, however, will want the lowest price possible - as the lower the price the greater the impact on earnings. </p> <p>Early speculation is that the range mid-point will be about 380p. The group may feel under pressure to include the 400p Mr Green said he was prepared to pay for the shares within the range. </p> <p>If M&amp;S cannot achieve its full \u00a32.3bn return through the tender it is expected to buy back shares in the market. </p> <p>Yesterday, as UBS cut its target price on the stock from 400p to 370p, the shares closed down 0.75p at 348.75p.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Garreth Ruane wants to travel back from Thailand via the train from Beijing to Moscow.</strong> </p> <p>It is one of the most unusual train journeys in the world and takes seven days and six nights without stopovers. Two trains leave from Beijing each week: one via Irkutsk (Trans Manchurian), the other via Ulan Bator (Trans Mongolian). We took the Trans Manchurian to Irkutsk, stayed over for two nights (taking a trip to fabulous Lake Baikal), and went on to Moscow on the Trans Siberian. We booked from Australia but our fellow travellers (in a tiny four-berth compartment) were English charity workers returning from Thailand and they booked via Monkey Business (<a href=\"mailto:\" monkeychina@compuserve.com\">MonkeyChina@compuserve.com</a>), stopping over with a Russian family at Lake Baikal, then continuing on Train No 9. If you don't stop over, the train continues to Moscow. </p> <p>You need to book well ahead because of the need for visas and both trains' popularity with Chinese and Russians. Don't rely on the train food - take what you can carry, and live on that. Pot noodles and coffee can be made with boiling water from the samovar in each carriage, and you can get bread, water and tomatoes at stops along the way. We found there was little food available from Irkutsk and vodka was the only booze. The bottled water from the 'dining' car was foul. </p> <p><strong> Wendy Dear</strong> </p> <p>Cross the Mekong into Laos from Chiang Khong in north east Thailand and take a bus (or, possibly, a boat) to Luang Namtha (you'll need a Lao visa which can be obtained in Chiang Khong - an attractive town in itself). In Luang Namtha, you can board a Chinese bus for Jinghong in the Chinese province of Yunnan (get your Chinese visa in the UK before departure). From Jinghong, a green, sleepy town, there's an overnight (sleeper) bus north to Kunming. </p> <p>Here you meet the Chinese railway network and can travel very comfortably by 'soft sleeper' to Beijing. However, I wouldn't. Instead, use the train to head north through western China to the northern city of Hohhot (spelled in at least two other transliterated ways). At Hohhot, you can board the once a week train for Ulaan Baatur, the capital of Mongolia. UB, as it's known, is well worth a stay (try the UB Guesthouse) and take a trip out into the wilderness to stay with a Mongolian family in a ger (tent). </p> <p>From UB, you can pick up the splendid Trans-Mongolian train to Ulan Ude and Irkutsk in Siberia. Take a few days out to spend beside Lake Baikal, north east of Irkutsk. Back in Irkutsk, you can join the Trans-Siberian train for the three-day journey to Moscow, then the night train to St Petersburg (the newly refurbished Hotel Oktyabrskaya is excellent and not expensive). </p> <p>From St Petersburg, take the train to Helsinki and pick up the night ferry to Stockholm. From here, if you've had enough, you can get a cheap Ryanair flight to the UK or, if you're really determined, cross Sweden to the west coast and pick up a ferry from Gothenburg for England. </p> <p><strong> Lawrence Forrester</strong> </p> <p>Tickets are very difficult to get on the spot, and visas for China, Mongolia, Russia and Belarus are not available at the various borders.

  "<p>My novel The Blackpool Highflyer is about working people taking railway excursion holidays from Halifax in the hot summer of 1905, and sometimes dying violently in the process. The main destinations depicted are Blackpool and Scarborough, the leading seaside resorts in the north of England, then as now. </p> <p>The difference between now and then is that in 1905 they were also the main overnight holidaying places for northerners. Blackpool Central Station (which was right under the Tower and is now, provokingly, a car park) had 23 excursion platforms, and was the busiest station in Europe during the summer months. Scarborough had fewer excursion platforms, but they were exceptionally long, and a bench adjoining one of them survives intact at the station, 150 yards from end to end. </p> <p>The book is based on historical research mingled with my own memories of holidaying in the resorts as a child growing up in York. Scarborough was our home resort, whereas Blackpool, being over the Pennines - where things were almost, but not quite, exactly the same - had a touch of the exotic. But we visited both most years, and I have continued to go back to each one very regularly, my mind swinging like a pendulum between the two, constantly comparing. </p> <p>Blackpool I think of as red: the red Accrington brick of the houses, the maroon girders of the Tower, which I'm always disappointed to see are not rusting; the redness of the sunburnt, sozzled faces. In Edwardian times, these would have belonged to the excursionists from the mills, perhaps dancing on the Central Pier until the music stopped at 5.30pm; today most likely to stag party members. </p> <p>Scarborough I think of as green, what with the grassy hill on which the castle sits, the bowling and putting greens, the many public gardens. A single signpost on the esplanade, the elegant stucco street that overlooks the southernmost part of the South Bay, carries signs to \"Italian Gardens\", \"Harbour Gardens\", \"Rose Garden\". It was in Scarborough, mystified aged 10 by a notice in a flower bed, that I asked: \"Dad, what's a herbaceous border?\" The question would probably never come up in Blackpool where Stanley Park, the town's main bit of green, is a fairly marginal attraction. </p> <p>Another elemental difference is that Scarborough is built on a more epic scale. A standard entertainment among the over 50s is to sit on one of the clifftop benches with a pair of binoculars, and just gaze about. A valley - traversed by the beautiful Spa Bridge - cuts through the South Bay, and the castle hill is so steep that a hot day presents the sight of many trippers contemplating the steep pathways up to the battlements and deciding: \"We'll do the castle another day, shall we?\" Double-decker buses - often, by way of a bonus, open topped - are required to ferry trippers from the North Bay to the South Bay, the distance being quite unwalkable to any family with toddlers. </p> <p>Blackpool is more compressed, the houses seeming to huddle around the Tower for protection. But in any battle of numerical scale, Blackpool wins outright. It receives 12 million visitors a year, making it the most visited resort in the UK, and has 90,000 bed spaces. Scarborough is ambling along with 2.25m visitors and 50,000 bed spaces. Blackpool Pleasure Beach is Britain's most visited free-admission attraction, with 145 rides. The nearest equivalent in Scarborough is Lunar Park on the South Bay, with about 6 rides, mostly suitable for nervous nine year olds. </p> <p>At the top of the first drop on the biggest roller coaster at the Pleasure Beach, the Pepsi Max Big One, you are directly alongside an aeroplane warning beacon, which is a bit worrying. The only equivalent thrill in Scarborough comes from the three venerable cliff trams that have been running between the town and the front for over a hundred years. For some idea of the experience, imagine stepping into a cricket pavilion that suddenly begins to descend quite rapidly at an angle of 60 degrees. </p> <p>Blackpool Tower is 518ft high; for a good while after its completion in 1894, it was the tallest structure in Britain and still seems like it when you go to the top and step on to the transparent floor known as \"the walk of faith\", and then - the difficult part - look down. Scarborough riposted with its own Tower in 1897. It was only a 150ft high. OK, its top revolved . . . but it never caught on, and was demolished in 1907. </p> <p>Blackpool has been pursuing superlatives for 150 years and Scarborough can't compete, except perhaps with this simple, striking fact: it was the first seaside resort in Britain. When Blackpool was still a village boasting one mucky pond (hence the name), Scarborough was capitalising on its health-giving waters that had been discovered flowing from a cliff-side spring in 1620. There have been various buildings close to the site and called the Spa; the latest is late Victorian, Italianate, accommodating two theatres, a cluster of cafes and an outdoor theatre called the Sun Court Lounge. Ironically, given the name, the people who gather here in the mornings for concerts of light music often have blankets draped over their knees. </p> <p>It's not that Scarborough is overly genteel. It's just that it is, like everywhere else in Britain, more genteel than Blackpool. You can buy sticks of rock in the shape of erect penises in Scarborough; they're less in your face than in Blackpool. Risque comedians like Roy Chubby Brown - \"If easily offended please stay away\" - do play Scarborough (he's on at the Futurist Theatre on August 21), it's just that he's more associated with Blackpool (he plays the Opera House there on October 17). </p> <p>Blackpool has many lap dancing bars. Someone in Scarborough who ought to know told me that the town \"has one . . . but it's pretty hard to find\". There's a bloodthirsty strain to the entertainments at Blackpool. Louis Tussaud's waxwork museum boasts \"daily hangings\" of \"witches\". The most violent entertainment in Scarborough is \"Naval Warfare\" which has been breaking out the boating lake at Peasholm Green on summer afternoons since 1927. </p> <p> A ctually, this is a strange combination of violence and easy listening, being hosted by an organist situated in a pagoda in the centre of the lake. After playing jaunty tunes such as Any Dream Will Do, he invites the audience to sit back for \"a jolly good battle\". Coffin-sized model ships float into view propelled by council employees lying inside them. There is then a pyrotechnically impressive exchange of fire between \"the enemy\" and \"the English\", with a partisan commentary by the organist. The enemy used to be named: \"the Germans\", but political correctness, not to mention the quest for more continental visitors, put a stop to that, and the organist always ends by saying: \"Remember, everyone lives to fight another day.\" </p> <p>Blackpool, with its many cacophonous bars and clubs, boasts that it is \"the town that never sleeps\". Scarborough, frankly, does sleep, and the sound of the waves begins to assert itself shortly after 9pm, when the Peasholm Park fairylights are switched on. </p> <p>Blackpool has always been wild. As the official history of the town says: \"The temperance movement gained ground only slowly in Blackpool.\" But some people think it's been going too far lately, and this season a series of civic initiatives are in place to try and curb unruly behaviour. These go hand in hand with Blackpool's attempt, contingent upon a forthcoming reform of the gaming laws, to lure half a dozen big casinos to the town which will displace tackier current attractions. </p> <p>Blackpool is also making an unaccustomed move into art, with the series of stark, modernist sculptures along the new South Promenade. Scarborough will match this with \"The Wave\", a monumental sculpture simulating wave motion that is to be placed on the Marine Drive between the North and South Bays. This is controversial but not symptomatic of the kind of identity crisis that Blackpool may be undergoing. </p> <p>I would visit Scarborough to relax, Blackpool for the buzz. (I'd go up the Tower, have a blow on the piers, eat fish and chips in Harry Ramsden's, ride the Pepsi Max, get drunk and generally make myself sick.) Both have beaches of soft sand that at low tide seem to match the sea for expansiveness. Blackpool has three piers; Scarborough has the Stephen Joseph Theatre, cockpit for the genius of Alan Ayckbourn. Blackpool has the illuminations (visible, you know, from outer space), but Scarborough has Jimmy Savile, who lives on the Esplanade, and has had one of the town's benches inscribed \"Sir Jimmy Savile. But Not Just Yet\", the point being that he's still alive. </p> <p>How to choose? Here's an idea: don't. Every two hours a train runs between the two towns. The journey takes about three and a half hours, and is quite scenic. Do Blackpool first, then recover in Scarborough. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andrew Martin's novel The Blackpool Highflyer is published on August 19 by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a310.99.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Blackpool </strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Ryanair (0871 2460000, <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">ryanair.com</a>) flies from Stansted and Dublin from \u00a328 rtn inc taxes.

  "<p><strong>31st over: England 86-3 (Strauss 37, Thorpe 17)</strong> That's tea, and I'm off to find the Hollyoaks girls. Join my colleague Rob Murray for the final session from, ooh, about now. Thanks for all your emails, Rob.</p> <p><strong>30th over: England 83-3 (Strauss 35, Thorpe 16)</strong> It's a bit early to call it, but I'm saying Mohammed is a novelty bowler. He looks pretty innocuous, and I think once England get used to him they'll pick him off like decorations from a tree in early January.</p> <p><strong>29th over: England 82-3 (Strauss 34, Thorpe 16)</strong> Gayle to Thorpe, who I could watch bat all day. Maiden.</p> <p><strong>28th over: England 82-3 (Strauss 34, Thorpe 16)</strong> On comes Dave Mohammed, to bowl his Hoggesque left-arm wrist-spinners. I've been looking forward to seeing this chap bowl, and his first delivery spins a long way. Strauss then does very well to chop the quicker one behind square for four. As cuts go, that was later than - well - a Connex train on a Saturday morning when an over-by-over reporter is desperately trying to make it to work on time.</p> <p><strong>27th over: England 78-3 (Strauss 30, Thorpe 16)</strong> They're rattling through the overs here, so they are.</p> <p><strong>26th over: England 75-3</strong> A gentle passage of play this, I'd imagine, as England play for tea and West Indies aim to scoot through a few overs.</p> <p><strong>25th over: England 71-3</strong> Chris Gayle on now to bowl some more offspin. It's a dreadful clich\u00e9 - why else do you think I'm using it? - but England need to just play here: forget about the game context, and play even ball on its etc and so forth. That way, they could easily be 200 for 3 overnight, and all of a sudden they'd be able to plonk themselves in the box seat.</p> <p><strong>24th over: England 70-3</strong> Sylvester Joseph's off-spinners get their first airing in the Test arena. I'd offer a considered and doubtless insightful assessment of said twirlers, but Channel 4 have gone to the racing. Meanwhile, Jay-Jay Okocha has done something he couldn't manage all last season - he's managed to sup champers with those feisty Girls Aloud girlies. Either that, or he's scored a Premiership goal.</p> <p><strong>23rd over: England 66-3 (Strauss 23, Thorpe 11)</strong> \"Are you a United fan than Rob?\" asks Alex Pemberton. \"Shame on you. As a Liverpool-supporting Mancunian, my school years were rather unpleasant.\" I can imagine. \"Same old story today, for someone who won the European Golden Boot, Baros has the worst first touch I've ever seen.\" That's a very good point; he can look unbelievably shabby. But the boy knows how to finish all right.</p> <p><strong>22nd over: England 65-3 (Strauss 22, Thorpe 11)</strong> Belting pull shot from Thorpe off Edwards deserved a hell of a lot more than the one run it garnered. Ever since he pulled South Africa into submission in 1994, Thorpe's career has been defined by that whip-crack shot. </p> <p><strong>21st over: England 61-3 (Strauss 21, Thorpe 10)</strong> Strauss hasn't looked in good touch at all, but it's always a good sign if you can dig in and he's into the 20s now.</p> <p><strong>20th over: England 57-3</strong> Edwards is back, which is the shrewdest move I've seen since my rook swallowed up my mate's queen last week. But Graham Thorpe, as he usually does, has instilled some sobriety in proceedings.</p> <p><strong>19th over: England 53-3 (Strauss 15, Thorpe 8)</strong> \"I remember Mark Butcher featuring in Popbitch, when he was spotted simulating canine tomfoolery behind a female co-presenter at the Twenty20 Finals last year,\" alleges Andrea Lowe. \"I don't think she was aware of it and I'm not sure that's the sort of thing you're allowed to make over-by-over readers aware of either.\" Wrong!</p> <p><strong>18th over: England 45-3</strong> \"Am I the only one confused here,\" says Joe Stead, scratching his bonce. \"We have signs of the start of summer, in England's batting collapse (and sorry all the confidence from the last 9 months still hasn't made me into an optimist), and also the signs of autumn in the start of the football season. Plus I was in Harrods the other day and they have started their Christmas world already. I have no idea when in which season it is anymore.\" 2004-05?</p> <p><strong>17th over: England 45-3</strong> Oof! That could have been another one. Strauss had an almighty heave at Bravo, and the ensuing edge flew just over the slips. </p> <p><strong>WICKET! England 40-3 (Vaughan b Bravo 12)</strong> Now then! Beautiful inducking delivery from Bravo and Vaughan, falling over like a drunk at an ice rink, is bowled off his pads. Big problems for England now.</p> <p><strong>16th over: England 39-2</strong> \"Ay up Rob,\" chirps David Turner. \"How's about asking your small audience: 'Have any Test cricketers appeared in popbitch?? And if so what for...' As a long time subscriber to popbitch nothing springs to mind, although I guess Tuffers might have had the odd mention. But maybe I missed the story about: Which opening batsman was seen sniffing white lines off the toned thighs of a random D-list soap star in [insert trendy nightclub]...\"</p> <p><strong>15th over: England 39-2 (Strauss 10, Vaughan 12)</strong> Massive, shrieking-cat shout for lbw against Strauss by Bravo, but it clearly pitched outside leg. \"Champers with Hollyoaks girls?\" chuckles an excited Richard Foster. \"Well, I suppose if Charlize is not available...\" Consolation will hopefully be found in the presence of the delightful Coral-loving Welsh barmaid Danielle at my local in Rochester. Here's hoping.</p> <p><strong>14th over: England 38-2</strong> Strauss is as becalmed as a Connex train on a Saturday morning. \"I just read the 9th over as, 'And then we'll all spend tonight supping champers with the Hollioakes', Which struck me as rather a strange sort of fantasy to have, even by an over-by-over reporter's standards,\" says Andrea Lowe-Profile. \"I think perhaps my own hangover had addled my brain.\" I wish I could say the same; alas, my Hollyoaks fixation-that-is-rapidly-becoming-an-obsession, and-an-alarming-one-at-that-for-someone-who-is-now-28-years-old, has nothing to do with excess Hoegaarden.</p> <p><strong>13th over: England 37-2</strong> Bravo to Strauss. As in Dwayne, not 'haway the lad, well done'. One run. \"I thought you would get enough pay from the Guardian to afford digital,\" says James Hamilton. \"The cheap so-and-sos...\" Oh, we have digital - it's just my rampant technophobia that stops me working out how to find E4. With it being the weekend, there are no nearby nerds I can drag by the ears up the stairs to sort it out.</p> <p><strong>12th over: England 36-2</strong> Collymore drifts onto leg stump, and Vaugham times him through midwicket for a picture-perfect boundary. Beautiful stuff.</p> <p><strong>11th over: England 32-2 (Strauss 7, Vaughan 8)</strong> As Jermain Defoe equalises at White Hart Lane, Dwayne Bravo comes on for West Indies. England have calmed this down a little bit after that tumultuous start.</p> <p><strong>10th over: England 31-2</strong> \"I hate the bloody racing interrupting the coverage on C4,\" says James Hamilton. \"There are still some of us who don't have digital!\" Tell me about it..</p> <p><strong>9th over: England 29-2</strong> Vaughan, who had problems with Edwards in the Caribbean, cuts him classily for four. \"The first goal of the season goes to a fella in my fantasy team,\" quips Richard Foster. \"Things cannot go wrong today - Vaughan and Strauss will see us through with a hundred or so apiece.\" And then we'll all spend tonight supping champers with the Hollyoaks girls, right?</p> <p><strong>8th over: England 21-2</strong> West Indies gets a bit cocky here: Collymore takes a return drive and flings it in the direction of the stumps, even though Vaughan hadn't left his crease. Someone out to remind that you need more than two quick wickets to move above 8th in the world.</p> <p><strong>7th over: England 19-2</strong> Gillette-close shave for Strauss, who edges Edwards just short of third slip. It was a no-ball anyway, but England, like a hungover hack on a bouncy castle, are having a torrid time here.</p> <p><strong>6th over: England 17-2 (Strauss 4, Vaughan 1)</strong> Another beauty from Collymore snakes away at the last minute like an over-by-over reporter's attempted simile to beat Vaughan outside off stump.</p> <p><strong>5th over: England 15-2</strong> Edwards is really screeching in, and Strauss is beaten outside off stump. This is just as it was in the Caribbean - Edwards on the rampage, and England losing two early wickets. Then, Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain got them out of jail. Who will stand up now?</p> <p><strong>4th over: England 13-2</strong></p> <p><strong>WICKET! England 13-2 (Key b Collymore 6)</strong> What an absolute jaffa from Corey Collymore. It pitched off and hit off. The seam gripped the pitch like a suit clutching a pole on a tube that's swaying to and fro, and knocked his off pole over. Magnificent stuff, and England - and Key - have got problems now.</p> <p><strong>3rd over: England 11-1</strong> \"Now for a really good hangover cure, there was a picture of Ms Theron showing a little more than she should have on Popbitch yesterday,\" says Alan Tunnicliffe. \"Probably not the type you could put on the site though!\" That's where the imagination kicks in.</p> <p><strong>2nd over: England 11-1</strong> Big, big innings this for Robert Key who, you sense, people are looking for an excuse to drop. With his three sloppy post-221 dismissals, he has started to give them one. Here he edges Collymore low through the slips for four with nicely soft hands. Meanwhile, Djibril Cisse has put Liverpool 1-0 up at Spurs.</p> <p><strong>1st over: England 1-1</strong> \"I am here!\" screams Rich Foster. \"I looked but couldn't find the over-by-over before lunch [that'll be the Connex] - finally i see it, happy days. Well, as happy as it can be considering the first session and I am at work missing both the cricket and the Olympics. However there is hope in my heart that Pompey will start this season in a similar way to last year.\" And mine that United will somehow scab a 1-1 draw tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>WICKET! England 0-1 (Trescothick c Sarwan b Edwards 0) </strong> Gone second ball! Trescothick fences away from his body at a hot one from Edwards - shades of last winter - and Sarwan pouches the low chance at second slip. Well well well.</p> <p><strong>Declaration</strong> A comic moment of near-controversy. England marched out all business-like, and then Brian Lara declared! Trescothick and Strauss legged it off to prepare, and Michael Vaughan looked about as happy as a man who'd just lost his fiance to Richard Whiteley. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that before and, as my colleague Rob Murray observed, it's the first battle Lara's won all series. So West Indies close on 395-9.</p> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> It's hard to know what was depressing in the morning session: England's let-beat-the-hell-out-of-the-middle-of-the-pitch tactics, or the fact I had just <em>one</em> email.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Blackbird House</strong> <br>by Alice Hoffman <br>244pp, Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a312.99 </p> <p>In his memoirs of his travels in England, Nathaniel Hawthorne was homesick for his native Massachusetts produce: \"I never ate an English fruit... that could compare in flavor with a Yankee turnip.\" That unexpectedly tasty Yankee turnip now plays an important role in Alice Hoffman's Blackbird House, 12 intricately connected stories set in a farmhouse on the tip of Cape Cod that trace the history of the farm's inhabitants over 200 years of American storms and tragedies, and celebrate the strength and endurance of women. </p> <p>In the first story, \"The Edge of the World\", set during the British blockade of the Cape just after the American revolution, fisherman John Hadley becomes \"fascinated with turnips, how hardy they were, how easy to grow, even in sandy soil\". After John and his two young sons are lost in a May gale at sea, his widow Coral turns her back on the ocean, and plants turnips alongside acres of sweet-peas \"strong as weeds\" in the farm he has built for her. </p> <p>The turnip crop provides her with income, and serves as an emblem of grief and renewal; \"people said they were so sweet a single bite could bring a man to tears\". In the last story, \"Wish You Were Here\", cancer survivor Emma comes to the farmhouse on midsummer's night (\"when you become who you really are\") in the 1990s. She is divorced, childless and bereft; but finding some stubby wild turnips, the tenacious descendants of those planted two centuries before, gives her the determination to renew her ripped-up life. \"I'll show you how to make turnip chutney,\" she tells a sceptical 10-year-old boy who comes by to play in the tangled yard. \"We'll see if it's any good.\" </p> <p>Some kids would jump on their bikes and be out of there at such an invitation; but in Hoffman's stories, 10-year-old boys are wise and curious spirits, part of a symbolic lexicon including red shoes (\"always the mark of a witch\"), fireflies, bluefish and a white blackbird that tie her tales together. These images and motifs are part of her technique of magical realism, a form of story-telling mixing the domestic with the supernatural that often incorporates fairytale and myth. Generally associated with Latin American literature, magical realism has also been used by American writers including Toni Morrison and Jonathan Safran Foer to handle unbearable histories such as slavery and the Holocaust. Hoffman too deals with terrible events, suffering and destruction, but she emphasises the feminist elements of the fairytale, which have been explored by Angela Carter and Margaret Atwood. The witch, she has said in an interview, represents women's history in New England, \"the history of the disenfranchised and the lost\". </p> <p>Among the uncanny women we meet are Ruth Blackbird Hill, the \"witch of Truro\"; her feisty daughter Garnet, who chooses exile from the house in the California gold rush; Lucinda, a tough housemaid who cuts her hair and goes off to join the Union army; Violet Cross, the \"ugly sister\" with a disfiguring birthmark who none the less lives through two world wars and sees her grandson marry a Holocaust survivor; and the modern women who sustain Blackbird House as the angry or indomitable daughters, sisters, wives and mothers of men living dangerously in the 1950s and 60s. In the eeriest story, \"The Wedding of Snow and Ice\", a teenage boy witnesses a nightmarish episode of wife-beating and murder, and identifies with the vulnerability and courage of women. </p> <p>There are autobiographical elements in the stories as well. Hoffman and her husband bought and restored a derelict 100-year-old cottage on the Cape, rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of a drowned 10-year-old boy. In addition, she wrote the stories, most of which have been published separately in magazines, while she was undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer. And, she has explained, Blackbird House is a post-9/11 book, about losing everything and dealing with loss. </p> <p>Hoffman is a skilled and experienced writer. Her stories are beautifully constructed, with subtle echoes and thematic links that repay close attention, while casual readers will respond to Hoffman's haunting characters, and to her lyrical setting; the farmhouse on the \"edge of the world\" with its summer kitchen, red-pear tree, ghost-birds and lush wild gardens, a powerful metaphor for regeneration. In Blackbird House, even homely root vegetables take on a numinous aura in their setting of sand, salt and scrub pine, and persuade us that out of \"every bitter thing something hardy will surely grow\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Elaine Showalter's Inventing Herself is published by Picador.</p>",
  "I had arranged to interview a woman, a refugee being held in a detention centre, earlier this month. But on the day that we were to speak, she was deported. This seemed unjust purely on legal grounds, since her solicitor was still attempting to continue through judicial review her claim for asylum. And it was particularly unjust since this woman - let's call her Jeanne - said that on a previous attempt at deportation on July 10, nine officials had restrained her physically by pinning her by her arms, twisting her neck and sitting on her back. Her 15-month-old child had seen the attack, and when he became distressed, she asked officials to take him to his father - the child is a British citizen because he has a British father. But the child was put into foster care, and the woman said it was some time before her partner was able to take him home. <p>I don't know how Jeanne felt when she was sitting in Yarl's Wood detention centre for three weeks without her son, or when she was deported to Ivory Coast without him 10 days ago. How would you feel? It seems almost cheap to try to give words to experiences like this. Pain, sorrow, anger, fear; nothing seems quite big enough. </p> <p>The experiences of refugees in detention centres flared briefly into the public consciousness a couple of weeks ago in the aftermath of a riot at Harmondsworth. Interest seems to have faded already, but it is necessary to try to keep a light shining on these experiences - because individuals working in this field say there is an increase in allegations of serious ill-treatment of refugees in detention centres or during deportation attempts. </p> <p>\"In this office we have only recently received allegations that people are being physically abused by officials in Britain,\" said Liz Norman, a caseworker at the solicitors Punatar and Co, in north London. \"I am certainly hearing more stories of abuse than in the past,\" said Nicola Rogers, a barrister who specialises in immigration law. \"I am seeing increasing numbers of cases of ill-treatment,\" Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor with Birnberg Peirce, told me. </p> <p>The government and its agencies are acting on a continuum with a hostile public attitude that has been developed by the rightwing press. But however inured you are to the nasty rhetoric, what is shocking is that harsh treatment seems to be increasingly targeted at women and children. Nicola Rogers says that she believes the children are no longer seen as children, but simply as an extension of the adult, the scum, the leech. And some people working in the field also say they believe that, given the pressure on immigration officers to meet quotas for removals, women with young children are being increasingly targeted for detention and deportation because it is assumed that they will go quietly. So although women make up only a small minority of those in detention, stories of ill-treatment and injustice involving women and children are becoming more frequent. </p> <p>I spoke to one woman, Sumaiya Kizza, who was visiting a friend on Sunday July 18 when she heard a banging on the door at 7.30am. She opened it to find several police and immigration officers. Even though they had actually come for her friend, Sumaiya and her 10-month-old baby were also forced into the van, without a chance to pack or even to dress properly. Sumaiya's papers were, in fact, in order, her asylum claim was still pending, and she had never failed to turn up to an appointment. But she and her baby were taken to the immigration centre at Croydon and then, in a boiling hot van, to Oakington detention centre, her baby sobbing itself hoarse; even when they got there, she was given no suitable food for the baby. </p> <p>Sumaiya was released the following Thursday, but only after pressure from Women Against Rape, a campaigning organisation that supports many women in detention and at risk of deportation. The friend detained with her (who is too nervous to give her real name - we'll call her Hannah) was taken twice to Heathrow for deportation with her two-year-old daughter, who is a British citizen and cannot therefore legally be forced into deportation. As with Jeanne, Hannah found herself facing the impossible choice of leaving her child or taking the child with her into a country where she believed their lives would be in danger. </p> <p>\"This officer shouted and grabbed me and pulled me up and down. Then they pointed to this group of men in suits and said, if you're not going they will handle you physically and you will see who is the winner. Then they grabbed my daughter off me and held her. I said, let me hold her. She started crying. He was holding her so I had to follow them to the aeroplane.\" This attempted deportation on July 19 and another on July 22 were halted at the last moment; legal proceedings concerning Hannah and her daughter are continuing. </p> <p>Although decent campaigning organisations and lawyers carry on, stopping an unfair deportation here or springing a distressed detainee there, most people in detention are incredibly isolated, unable to access any support, and their stories are not heard. It is quite glamorous for journalists to find tales of rape and torture in darkest Africa, but much less intriguing to hear how some of the survivors may end up crying in the back of a van on the way to Heathrow. </p> <p>One woman who is currently pursuing a claim for compensation against the Home Office had sought asylum on the basis that she had been tortured, raped and beaten in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but was held for five months in various detention centres in the UK. Her solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, told me that one night - without a removal notice being served on her, which is legally required before any attempt at deportation is made - officials burst into her room at 3am. According to the woman, they pushed her to her knees while she was naked, twisted her arm behind her back and struck her back. A witness to her ordeal said that she saw and heard the woman shouting: \"They're killing me, they're beating me!\" She was left in another room and attempted suicide by tying a torn sheet around her neck, but she was then handcuffed, given a dress and nothing else, and taken to Heathrow. The pilot refused to allow her on board because of her excessive distress and lack of proper clothing. </p> <p>Although liberals tend to say that they are on the side of genuine refugees, a terrible fatalism infects this debate. Perhaps we have begun to believe that widespread use of detention and forced deportation is essential for a workable immigration system; but too many stories that you hear are at variance with even government guidelines - like the detention of refugees who are at no risk of absconding, or the forced deportation of refugees who have not exhausted their legal options - and characterise a piecemeal, callous system in which the right hand deliberately fails to know what the left hand is doing. </p> <p>Many people working in the field told me that they believed the public would not accept these abuses if they knew more about what was happening. Certainly, if you have once heard one of these stories first hand it sticks like a burr in your mind. I wish I could play to you the painful sobs of Sumaiya and Hannah, as they told me about their children's distress and their own fear that it might all happen again tomorrow. And all this is being done in the pretence that our society needs protecting from these women. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:n.walter@btinternet.com\">n.walter@btinternet.com</a></p>",

I had an open mind. I meant to be generous and understanding. I smiled at the charming, but haphazard service - which is more than Arabella (Weir - yes, that's her real name) managed, she's far fiercer than me. It's too early to tell, I told myself, when the wrong water was brought, the wine we wanted turned out not to be available. And then our glasses were filled and refilled in nervous compensation with its substitute. And then there were difficulties in comprehension, the wrong dish for the wrong person, a sudden rush of dishes and then a long pause; and so on. Give them the benefit of the doubt, I said, the place has only been open a couple of weeks. Arabella clicked her teeth and frowned a queenly frown. </p> <p>What about the decor? she said. What about it? I said. Handsome post-Star Wars industrial above, I said, peering at the network of pipes and air-con ducts and curious bits of padded cladding, all painted creamy white. More Blake's 7 than Star Wars, she said, dredging up an ancient TV series set in a space station of droll naffness. It's all smooth enough at ground level, though, I said. Smooth like a canteen, said Arabella. A Norman Foster canteen, I said. Norman Wisdom canteen, she said. Come on, I said, at least the food isn't Norman Wisdom. </p> <p>Roka, the restaurant in which we sat, is the creation of Rainer Becker, one of the moving spirits behind Zuma, the phenomenally successful phenomenon that took some of the precepts of sushi and sashimi and moulded them to the tastes of Londoners who like food that puts prettiness before taste and for whom \"healthiness\" is in place of godliness. I did not have a happy experience at Zuma. I cannot recall the slimy gobbets of Arctic-chilly raw sea urchin roe without a shudder. </p> <p>At Roka, Mr Becker has followed his Japanese muse still further, into the thickets of more specialised cooking techniques. There's tempura, sashimi and maki, with which I am familiar, but also kushiage, chu-maki robabata yasai, and robata niku, with which I am not. Under the heading \"robata yaki\", the menu explains that \"many years ago fishermen from coastal villages would cook their catch over the open flame and share the delights with others by passing the food on from boat to boat. \"Robata\" translates into \"cooking with open flames\". And there, by golly, are the fishermen - no, disappointingly, chefs - in the middle of the room for all to see, cooking away over the open flames. </p> <p>For us they cooked ebi no tempura, kuruma-ebi, unagi temaki zushi, maguro no tataki, ko nasu, uzura no miso zuke, kani no kama meshi. I am all for exploring far distant corners of the culinary galaxy, particularly from the comfort of a restaurant table in my own back yard, even more particularly when the translations have, for me, the refined allure of the poems of Basho. </p> <p>Take ebi ni tempura. That becomes \"crispy rock shrimp with prickly ash and lime\". What fair-minded person could resist that \"prickly ash\", not to mention the \"crispy rock?\". Or uzura no miso zuke, which becomes quail marinated in plum wine and red miso. Doesn't that plum wine just sing out to you? Well, it did to me. And as for kani no kama meshi, or rice hot pot with king crab, and wasabi tobiko as we knew it to be (sorry, sir, what's tobiko? I still don't know), I was halfway to paradise. </p> <p>Sadly, I never got more than halfway, or even quarter way, to be truthful. The lure of the menu is all very well, singing a siren song to the imagination, but the food should then, in my view, deliver on those promises of gustatory bliss. And the trouble is that the dishes at Roka were a triumph of fashionability over flavour. It's Japanese lite. </p> <p>To be fair, ko nasu - egg plant in mirin, ginger and soy - was beautiful in most senses of the word: lithe, sloppy, floppy, but punchy with the flavourings. And the quail dish lived up to its promise, more or less, being sticky, nicely burnt and mildly meaty in the way that quail is. </p> <p>But as for the rest, I am not sure that I can call to mind a single flavour. That prickly ash? A busted flush. The rock shrimp? A ghost of a ghost of flavour. Kuruma-ebi (tiger prawn tempura)? If only the shellfish had had a tithe of the flavour of the batter, but it didn't. Unagi temaki zushi (hand-rolled cone with eel teriyaki, avocado, shiso and sansho pepper) looked like the Camberwell carrot in Withnail &amp; I, but turned out to be a case of the bland leading the bland. </p> <p>And so on. I trust you get the picture. Even my pudding of banana green tea baked cream and tonka bean ice cream, which would have made more sense if it had been written as banana, green tea baked cream, and tonka bean ice cream, did not relieve the impression that Roka is to all intents and purposes, a taste-free zone. </p> <p>Which probably means that it perfectly represents the contemporary gastro-zeitgeist, aspirations and fulfilment. It isn't even that expensive by London standards - \u00a371.30 for food. But it's the last time I let good intentions get the better of me.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Open</strong> Monday-Saturday, 12 noon-2.30pm; 5.30-11pm.

  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday August 17</b> <br>  In the article below, we said in error that the Serious Fraud Office is one of the organisations involved in the merger to form the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. The SFO will continue to operate as an independent government department but will work closely with Soca.      The first head of Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, which is to have 5,000 agents, was named yesterday as Bill Hughes, the director of the National Crime Squad. <p>The former head of MI5, Sir Stephen Lander, was appointed chairman of the FBI-style agency, Soca, which is due to be set up in 2006 as part of a renewed drive against the multibillion-pound drug and people trafficking trade in Britain. </p> <p>Announcing the appointments yesterday, the home secretary, David Blunkett, said that Mr Hughes, who will be paid up to \u00a3150,000 a year as director general of Soca, had a proven track record in the police service and in managing the police response to serious and organised crime. </p> <p>\"As criminals become more sophisticated, so we must raise our game to fight it. The creation of a single agency to tackle organised crime marks a step change in our efforts to reduce the harm it does to the UK and its citizens,\" said Mr Blunkett. </p> <p>The new agency is to be created from an amalgamation of the National Crime Squad, which Mr Hughes currently heads, with the National Criminal Intelligence Service, Special Branch, the Serious Fraud Office, and the investigative arms of customs and the immigration service. There will also be input from the security services. One of its aims will be to end the occasional turf wars that ignite between the different law enforcement agencies. </p> <p>Soca will be able to call on the resources of about 5,000 investigators when it starts work in two years' time. Legislation to be discussed this autumn will give the agency powers to set up a new \"supergrass\" system, with US-style plea bargaining used on a much wider scale in the hope that those who turn \"Queen's evidence\" will help break some of the organised crime gangs operating in Britain. </p> <p>Mr Hughes, 53, was a crash safety engineer for British Leyland before he joined Thames Valley police in 1975. He worked his way up through the ranks to become deputy chief constable of Hertford shire before joining the National Crime Squad in 2001. </p> <p>He has said that he has always been obsessed by organised crime, which he describes as \"people who divorce themselves from the dirty end of the business but are fuelling illegal trade\". In recent years he has also taken a leading role in Operation Reflex, which combats illegal migration routes across Europe. </p> <p>Mr Hughes said yesterday that he hoped the new organisation would be flexible, innovative and, above all, one step ahead of the criminals. </p> <p>\"That means building an organisation that will attack the often very complex and multi-faceted world of serious and organised crime. It means working with our international partners to tackle the criminal across borders as well as national organised gangs.\" </p> <p>The appointment of Sir Stephen, who was head of MI5 in the 1990s, underlines the importance that ministers place on the degree of cooperation that Soca will need to develop with the security services in order to make any headway.</p>",
  "Lawyers and campaigners for refugees say that they are seeing increasing numbers of cases where women and children asylum seekers are being picked up for deportation before their legal options have been exhausted. <p>Home Office guidelines state that asylum seekers should \"not be removed from the UK while there is outstanding legal action\". </p> <p>But solicitors involved in deportation cases accuse the immigration authorities of targeting women with young children, even when they have grounds for further legal proceedings, in the hope that they will come quietly. The government, they claim, always has difficulty meeting its targets on removals. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned of several cases in which lawyers allege that mothers and children were picked up for deportation while the legal process was still continuing. </p> <p>Campaigners also claim that they are receiving more complaints about ill-treatment by immigration officers before deportation attempts. </p> <p>A spokeswoman at Women Against Rape and the Black Women's Rape Action Project, which has supported many women before and during their detention, said: \"We are hearing more stories of brutal treatment by immigration officers than before.\" </p> <p>Mark Scott, a solicitor with Bhatt Murphy, who is dealing with various claims against the Home Office, also said that the problem seemed to be worsening. </p> <p>But last night the Home Office said that all deportations were handled in accordance with the law, and denied the reports of ill-treatment.</p>",
  "<p>Pod's not one to make a song and dance about anything, much less blow his own trumpet - though come to think of it I was caught on digital camera doing both at the weekend, at an impromptu barbie organised to celebrate my fellow bits-and-pieces merchant Gareth Batty's England nod, after which Bats was kind enough to say I was the new Roy Castle. Or it may have been the new Roy Hattersley, as things were getting a bit hazy by that stage of the evening. Suffice it to report that I woke up the next afternoon in the Travelodge Droitwich, thinking I was in the Moat House Redditch, and too late for breakfast in both. </p> <p>But the point I'm making is that the story has now come out in the papers about something involving Pod that happened a few weeks back. The words of the loose-leaf police notebook give a chilling, Reservoir Dogs-type feeling to the incident: \"We were called to the Upper Tavern, a stand at Lord's cricket ground, on July 23 after a man aged 37 allegedly drew a knife on another man, aged 46. When we arrived the suspect had left. No weapons have been recovered.\" </p> <p>No doubt you're looking at the picture at the top of this column and are assuming that Dave Podmore is the suspect in this scenario. Look again. I didn't get the smooth forehead and unblemished features of a guy 10 years his junior by running away from the scene of a crime. I didn't when I was a punk kid stuffing spuds up the exhaust of Jack van Geloven's motorbike in the Coalville car park in the 70s, and I'm not about to start now. </p> <p>No, it was Pod who was the innocent victim of a totally unwarranted attack by a well-dressed MCC member, someone you might have thought would share my views on hunting with dogs and asylum seekers, and the exciting possibility of combining the two. But no sooner had I switched on my mobile during a lull in the first Windies test than I felt the blade suddenly rasping at my beard, something I haven't experienced since Jacqui and I had a row about her wanting to evict Jade from Big Brother 3 because nobody likes a clever dick. </p> <p>Anyway, in accordance with the warning posters plastered all over the Grace Gates, I wasn't just using my mobile for casual purposes, eg putting a bet on the time that Blowers first got the score wrong on TMS. I was actually downloading a great new game courtesy of Chris Read who's the official supplier of software to the England lads now he's got more time on his hands and needs to supplement his Notts income. </p> <p>And judging from the number of eager punters who gathered round me in their trademark egg-and-bacon ties and marmalade-encrusted shirts, Ready's game won hands down. Cannibal Planet - the Chewed Skulls' Revenge going head to head against \"Chubb\" Key putting Tino Best to the sword? No contest. If you ask me Geraint Jones is going to have to come up with some decent deals on in-car entertainment or energy snacks for the lads if he wants to hang on to his place behind the sticks. </p> <p>Actually, upsetting as it was, I'm glad the news about the ugly knife incident has come out when it has. Now that Twenty20's over and the Test series is deader than a trout in the Thames, cricket's got to do something drastic to put itself back into the box seat publicity-wise. Especially with Premiership football and the Olympics here this weekend and threatening a summer of violence and bad behaviour. Like our athletes, we don't want to be playing catch-up. </p> <p>Just look at what happened at Edgbaston on Saturday before the Twenty20 final - and can anyone remember the result, or which girl band were showing off their body piercings? Thought not. But it seems that in the all-important mascot race that went off first, Surrey's Roary the Lion crossed the line ahead of Lanky the Lancashire giraffe but was disqualified for changing his shoes, and Paul Allott had to suffer the indignity of rewriting his speech and presenting the big fluffy teacup to Lanky instead. </p> <p>Talk about a golden opportunity going begging. What happened to the mandatory drugs test? Urine samples taken under the lights would have given the night some real pizzazz. What happened to Roary being sent home in disgrace? Where were the kiss-and-tell stories by the girl in the Oval ticket office describing Roary as an animal in bed? </p> <p>Come on, guys, get a grip - the ICC Trophy's only weeks away and Max Clifford's waiting. </p> <p><em>Dave Podmore was being put up for the MCC's martial arts committee by Christopher Douglas and Andrew Nickolds</em></p>",
  "<p>The Last Party, by John Harris (Harper Perennial, \u00a38.99) </p> <p>Ah, Britpop: Suede v Blur, Blur v Oasis, the rehabilitation of the union flag, Pulp, Elastica, Tony when he was young and cool... Harris's book about \"Britpop, Blair and the Demise of English Rock\" narrates the journey from baggy to Coldplay, including interviews with all the major players. Relive the soap opera of Damon and Justine, and the defining moment when Noel drank champagne with Tony at No 10 (Noel mentioned the Liverpool dockers: \"[Blair's] words were, 'We'll look into it.' And I said, 'Yes, you probably will, won't you?'\"). Harris has done a superb job of weaving his history into a narrative, but his taste is questionable - Oasis are considered generally bad, and he seems to have no ear for the Gallagher brothers' humour; Blur are grandiosely compared to the Beatles; and when he complains of Radiohead's \"lyrics in which metaphor and symbolism slip away from their moorings\", he sounds like a grumpy grandfather.<strong> SP</strong> </p> <p><strong> Godless Morality, by Richard Holloway (Canongate, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Ex-bishop writes book on \"Keeping Religion Out of Ethics\" shock. Speaking as though from a fireside armchair, Holloway conducts an intelligent discussion of contemporary issues such as sex, the rights of homosexuals, the use of drugs, abortion and reproductive technologies. Noting the positions of fundamentalist Christians, he takes a liberal, pluralist view, much inspired by Isaiah Berlin and even Nietzsche, preferring what he terms \"ethical jazz\" to strait-laced absolutism. The plea to keep God out is sensible but somewhat unconvincingly argued. \"History has taught us that many claims on behalf of God have been subsequently rejected for moral reasons, so the fact that an injunction comes with a divine label attached is no guarantee of divine origin.\" The \"so\" is faulty: just because we have rejected allegedly divine injunctions does not prove that they were not divine. Of course, you can't reason someone out of a position they were not reasoned into in the first place. <strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Feeling the Heat, edited by Jim Motavalli (Routledge, \u00a313.99)</strong> </p> <p>If The Day After Tomorrow took the silly, popcorn route to warning us about global warming, this collection of \"Dispatches from the Frontlines of Climate Change\" - with its poignant cover image of a symposium of confused-looking penguins standing around on some rocks, presumably wondering where all the snow has gone - aims to convince by dropping science on us. Rather than a synoptic overview, it collects painstaking research and observation of ecosystems and microclimates. New Jersey beaches are disappearing at an alarming rate; in Alaska and the western Arctic, the ice is retreating and polar bears are starving; Fiji is gradually sinking; glaciers are shrinking everywhere you look; Asia is choking under an enormous smog cloud. The 11 hottest years on record have occurred since 1983; and many forests could become net carbon emitters (rather than sinks) by 2040. Perhaps not as sexy as a tsunami hitting Manhattan, but worrying enough. <strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Footprints in Stone, by Janet Bord (Heart of Albion, \u00a314.95)</strong> </p> <p> Here are some footprints Jesus apparently left in stone in Kashmir; here the footprints of Vishnu on a marble slab beside the Ganges. The Virgin Mary, who got around, left her footprint on a rock in Wales; King Arthur's horse left hoofprints in rock; and the Devil himself leaves footprints, handprints or hoofprints all over the shop, depending on his impish whim. Here are also ghostly childish handprints and bloody faceprints, and the marks left behind by freakish monsters and Martians. And of course, we must not forget Bigfoot, whose footprint, as his name suggests, is really big. What does it all mean? Perhaps, as Bord suggests, the myths that surround such marks \"helped to bring an otherworldly dimension to the landscape which they knew so well, imbuing it with sanctity\". Or perhaps aliens, monsters and giant bipedal gorillas really do roam the Earth. With Bord's handy geographical list, you can go and find out for yourself. <strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Six Days: How the 1967 War Shaped the Middle East, by Jeremy Bowen (Pocket, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Israel inflicted a humiliatingly swift and comprehensive defeat on Egypt, Jordan and Syria in June 1967, capturing the West Bank (hence all of Jerusalem), Gaza, the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights. By turning Israel into a hubristic occupying power, Bowen argues, the victory became a \"curse\", entailing vast costs, internal division and a continuing death toll. Adopting a conventional impersonal approach to the pre- and post-war periods, the former BBC correspondent switches styles to great effect in covering the conflict itself. Drawing on interviews by no fewer than 14 researchers, he tracks developments through the eyes of politicians, generals, combatants and civilians in the four countries involved, plus US and Soviet leaders. This hour-by-hour chronicle resembles a brainier and better-written version of a Tom Clancy thriller, making Six Days an enthralling as well as an important book.<strong> JD</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Kafka's Last Love: The Mystery of Dora Diamant, by Kathi Diamant (Vintage, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> Franz Kafka spent the last 11 months of his life with Dora Diamant, who shared a house with him in Berlin before accompanying him to the sanatorium where he died in 1924. He admired the ardent, independent spirit of a young woman who had broken away from a strict Hasidic upbringing in Poland; she loved Kafka - the learned, funny and gutsy mensch rather than the promising author, believing him when he said his writings were worthless (and later obeying his wishes by burning his notebooks). Luckily for her namesake and biographer, Diamant's subsequent career is almost equally absorbing. Like the heroine of some far-fetched picaresque novel designed to encompass the 20th century, she became a communist actress who escaped the Gestapo in Germany and Stalin's Terror in Moscow only to be interned in wartime England, eventually devoting herself to keeping Yiddish culture alive in London's East End.

  "<p><strong> Waterbourne, by Bruce Murkoff (Secker, \u00a312)</strong> </p> <p> More than one American reviewer has compared Waterbourne to Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain, though Murkoff's flavoursome chronicle of the great depression that pits humanity against the forces of nature more obviously has its roots in the tradition of Dreiser, Steinbeck and Hemingway. The Boulder dam project was one of the greatest engineering feats of the age, drawing thousands of migrant workers to the small town of Boulder, utterly transforming the place. Three of the migrants finally lock together as the focus of Murkoff's story: cultured chief engineer Filius Poe, mourning the loss of his wife and child; pretty waitress Lena McCardell, who has fled her bigamist husband with her son; and site worker Lew Beck from LA, nasty, brutish, very short, and out for revenge. Despite some predictability about who is going to end up with whom and who will end up in the river, this soft-voiced novel is admirable for its strong portrayal of a slab of social and engineering history. One would wish it at least a slice of Cold Mountain 's sales.</p> <p> <strong> Girls, by Nic Kelman (Serpent's Tail, \u00a310)</strong> </p> <p> Nic Kelman sets out to evoke a certain kind of jaded, wealthy, middle-aged American businessman who \"resents\" the women who are his equals (eg, the wife) for their supposed dual standards, and pursues carnality with very young women as a sort of healing sacrament. One of Kelman's creations allows himself to be seduced by a friend's teenaged daughter while he and his wife are guests in the family villa. Another, a father of two, worms his way into a college girl's room. Sandwiching these graphically recounted fantasies - Kelman says \"Suppose\" and \"Imagine\" a lot, and the girls never resist these men or disappoint - are his characters' attempts to justify their behaviour using a pretentious hotchpotch of Homer, history, linguistics and animal behaviour. Unsurprisingly, the book has been the subject of much controversy in the States. Although the author leaves his monsters to condemn themselves out of their own mouths, his moral purpose is evident, not least in his final line: \"How did we get so ugly?\" </p> <p> <strong> Geography, by Sophie Cunningham (Doubleday, \u00a310)</strong> </p> <p> Geography, too, drips with sex, but this time within the context of a relationship between equals - except here the balance of power goes badly askew. When Catherine meets Michael on a business trip, it is lust at first sight for both of them. By the time she goes home, after several days in bed with him, she is convinced they were made for one another. So why does Michael respond to her calls only when he feels like it and welcome further meetings only from time to time? Catherine's friends quickly diagnose Michael correctly as a manipulative commitment-phobe, but, hey, when do we ever listen to our friends? Still, most women would eventually twig, but the vulnerable Catherine's unrequited adoration lasts for years and years and looks set to ruin her life. Switching between urban Australia, America and India - where Catherine eventually takes herself on a pilgrimage of spiritual healing - Cunningham skilfully anatomises the roots of Catherine's obsession in a fresh and likeable story of modern mores.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Life and Death of Smallpox</strong><br> by Ian and Jenifer Glynn<br> 288pp, Profile, \u00a317.99</p> <p> One of the paradoxes of the World Health Organisation's campaign against infectious diseases is that the greater its success in eradicating once-deadly viruses and parasites, the greater their potential to wreak havoc on no longer immune human populations. This is nowhere more true than in the case of smallpox, a virus once familiar to Pepys, Napoleon and the lowliest cowherd but now the exotic preserve of a handful of governments and - if the Pentagon is to be believed - international terrorists. </p> <p>Eliminated from Europe and North America by the early 20th century and eradicated worldwide by the WHO in 1979, the variola virus or the \"pox\", as writers from Shakespeare to Thackeray have called it, induced one of the most unpleasant and disfiguring deaths known to man. Within weeks of contracting variola, a patient would break out in hard, raised spots that gradually softened and filled with pus. In two thirds of cases the \"pustules\" would flatten and scab off. But in the case of \"confluent smallpox\" the pustules were so numerous that they fused and the mortality rate rose to 60%, while in the rare and most horrific form, \"haemorrhagic smallpox\", death was virtually guaranteed. </p> <p>By the late 18th century, smallpox was killing 400,000 Europeans a year, one in 10 of them children under five; however, those who survived enjoyed immunity against further infections with only permanent pitted scars - the pock marks - to show for their ordeal. </p> <p>That is no longer the case. As Ian and Jenifer Glynn point out in their timely study of the disease, when a traveller from Mexico re-introduced the virus to New York city in 1947, such was the fear of a new epidemic that the authorities vaccinated six million people within a month. So that when, following September 11 2001, fears were raised that bio-savvy jihadists might be planning to release weaponised aerosols in crowded city centres, both the US and the UK began building up their smallpox vaccine stocks. </p> <p>Thankfully, the threatened attack never came and the Glynns do not go looking for it. Instead, they focus on the history of the disease from antiquity to the present day, taking in the pockmarked mummy of Rameses V, the Spanish conquest of Central America (a victory made possible by the conquistadors' prior exposure to the disease and the Aztecs' catastrophic lack of immunity) and the introduction of the then medico-revolutionary practice of inoculation, or \"variolation\", to England in the early 18th century. </p> <p>Apparently, the first person to witness this procedure, which entailed the insertion of infectious viral material from a smallpox victim under the skin of a non-immune patient, was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the eccentric wife of the British ambassador to Turkey. Likening it to the \"engrafting\" of a bud in horticulture (the Glynns point out that the literal meaning of inoculation is \"in-eyeing\"), Lady Mary had the procedure performed on her own son and in 1717 introduced it to England. But while inoculation, where successful, conferred lifelong immunity, in some cases inoculated patients would develop the full-blown disease and die, or else infect those near to them, increasing the risks for others. </p> <p>The result was that many educated parents, including Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang, actively resisted the new-fangled procedure. Explaining his decision not to inoculate his 11-year-old prodigy when a smallpox epidemic seized Vienna, Leopold wrote: \"It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in the world... or to take it to Himself\" (fortunately for mankind, \"He\" allowed the prodigy to survive). </p> <p>Edward Jenner, a lowly country doctor and expert on the nesting patterns of the cuckoo, in 1796 improved on inoculation by taking the related cowpox virus from a pustule on the arm of a milkmaid and injecting it into a healthy young boy. Jenner was able to show that vaccination by the cowpox, or vaccinia virus, induced protection against smallpox in a manner that was both safe for the patient and for those with whom he might come into contact. But while this was a major advance - one whose benefits we continue to reap today in the practice of vaccinating against diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella - Jenner spent much of his subsequent career, in the Glynns' phrase, \"kicking against the pricks\". </p> <p>Some, like Dr William Rowley, a prominent physician who launched a hysterical campaign claiming that vaccination had produced an \"ox-faced boy\", were relatively easy to dismiss. But others, such as John Birch, surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital, were not, invoking as he did the cold voice of Malthus that smallpox was \"a merciful provision on the part of Providence to lessen the burden of a poor man's family\". </p> <p>Thankfully, today such voices are no longer in the ascendant but, as the recent public concern over the side-effects of the MMR vaccine demonstrate, such worries have not gone away, merely receded. Raised in a world made safe by Jenner, for many the risks of contracting smallpox or some other disease will always seem more remote than the more immediate risks associated with vaccination. Having said that, were the unthinkable to happen and were terrorists to succeed in releasing the variola virus in a major western city tomorrow, I know where I would stand.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Honigsbaum is the author of The Fever Trail: The Hunt for the Cure for Malaria (Macmillan).
