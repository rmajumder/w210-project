  "<p>In the winter of 2002, my wife and I decided to take a wild gamble with our children's education and welfare. Rather than endure another dull winter in London, we packed four rucksacks, removed our children from school and flew to Vilcabamba, a remote village in southern Ecuador. </p> <p>That my daughter, Olivia, had just sat her exams for secondary school and we had her headmaster's blessing, or that we would be living in a wooden cabin in the middle of an eco-reserve - an experience which we felt could not be anything but educational - was neither here nor there. As far as our friends and family were concerned, we were being reckless and irresponsible. What if our children fell ill and we could not get them to a doctor? Worse, what if Olivia was accepted by one of the schools she had applied to and we failed to respond to the offer letter in time? </p> <p>In the event, the latter proved to be the most pressing concern. Although Vilcabamba boasts a modern health clinic, the village has only a handful of phone lines and, as we discovered soon after our arrival when we tried to email a friend to check the post, internet connections are erratic. Having said that, we never regretted our decision. </p> <p>From the moment we arrived at the Pole House - a log cabin in the middle of the Rumi-Wilco nature reserve - we were besotted. Suspended some 20ft above the forest floor beside a fast-flowing river, the Pole House boasted a rudimentary kitchen and one double and two bunk beds, but little else. It was bliss. We fell asleep to the rumble of the R\u00edo Chambo's churning waters and awoke to the squawk of parakeets and bright sunlight flooding through the loose-fitting wooden planks. From our first floor shutters we only had to reach out a hand to pluck oranges, tree tomatoes, bananas and passion fruit from the overhanging branches. In its one concession to modernity, the Pole House came equipped with a blender and we were soon mixing tropical smoothies to order. Not only that but Rumi-Wilco boasted its own shade-grown organic coffee. On arrival, we found a packet of ready roasted beans awaiting us in a welcome pack together with a delicious marmalade made from granadilla, another tropical fruit. </p> <p>The welcome pack, like the Pole House and its surroundings, is the brainchild of Orlando and Alicia Falco, a husband-and-wife team of biologists who used to work as guides in the Galapagos Islands. Depressed by the commercialisation of the islands and their steady erosion by tourism, the Falcos moved to Vilcabamba 10 years ago determined to start a reserve where their family and a few guests could live in harmony with nature. </p> <p>Orlando began by taming the river, then set about replanting native podocarpus and wilco trees in the surrounding hillsides. The result is that today Rumi-Wilco is self-sufficient in pretty much everything but electricity. The forest supplies all the Falcos' fruit and vegetable needs, while water for drinking and showering is drawn straight from a well. To pay for the upkeep of the reserve and extras such as bread and clothing, the Falcos rent out the Pole House and several adobe huts to passing backpackers. Needless to say, Rumi-Wilco proved both a revelation and an education. </p> <p>No sooner had we settled into our cramped accommodation than Olivia and Max disappeared into the forest with the Falcos' three children, Melissa, Omar and Lucas. Several hours later they returned from their botanising, their arms brimming with orchids, bromeliads and blue morpho butterflies. Within a week, these nature-adverse city dwellers (in London, Olivia and Max cower at the mere sight of an ant or spider) could name every tree on the reserve as well as several species of birds and insects. Max was particularly taken by the rhinoceros beetle - so named because of the vicious horn that protrudes from its hard black shell. However, his and his sister's fascination with the bugs that invaded our sleeping quarters each night soon paled into insignificance when we rode into the mountains high above the village. </p> <p>Vilcabamba is Quichua for \"sacred valley\". Orlando theorised that the area had been named after the wilco tree, whose seeds were prized by Inca shamans as a hallucinogen - hence his decision to cultivate the trees on his reserve. But the Incas, who arrived here in around 1480, some 50 years before the Spanish, may simply have fallen in love with the valley's idyllic setting. </p> <p>Although just four degrees south of the equator, the mountains on either side of Vilcabamba form a barrier against the humidity from the Pacific and Amazon, resulting in year-round blue skies and a mean temperature of 20C. After the conquest and independence, the Ecuadorian government forgot about Vilcabamba, but in 1955 the valley was \"rediscovered\" when Reader's Digest published an article remarking on the low incidence of heart disease and osteoporosis. Soon scientists and health tourists from around the globe were flocking to Vilcabamba drawn by reports of its youthful centenarians and their mineral-rich drinking water. Unfortunately, many of the supposed 100-year-olds turned out to be not quite 90, but the water was everything that had been advertised and by the early 1980s Vilcabamba had become a fixture on the hippy trail. </p> <p>Today, the village - with its small plaza dominated by a pretty white-and-blue church - attracts a mixture of bohemians and backpackers. Some come, as we did, for the nature and tranquility; others to party and sample san pedro, a psychotropic cactus that grows wild on nearby mountainsides. But whatever your motivation for visiting Vilcabamba, this Ecuadorian Shangri-La soon casts its spell. </p> <p>From our base at the Pole House, we could venture deep into the forest or trek high into the mountains above the village - the home not only of san pedro but of cinchona, the source of the valuable anti-malarial, quinine. One week, we hired a guide and ponies and rode to Las Palmas, a mountain refuge at 7,000ft which boasted spectacular waterfalls and its own treetop canopy walk. Each of these excursions was an education not just in botany and geology but in culture and also endurance. The refuge was empty when we reached Las Palmas, but by day two it was brimming with French, Dutch and Chilean backpackers (we communicated in Franco-Spanglish). Then, on day three, we hiked seven miles back down to the foot of the mountain, our guide having left earlier with the horses. I am happy to report that Olivia and Max, who cannot walk more than a few feet in London without complaining of fatigue, cantered to the bottom - a feat we put down to the scenery and our promise to treat them to omelettes and ice cream at Ch\u00e9, a favourite cafe in Vilcabamba's main square. </p> <p>Our most treasured moment, however, came on an excursion to another mountain - the Cerro Mandango. Rising 6,000ft above Vilcabamba, Mandango is steeped in mystery and legend. According to one story, in 1534 after the conquistadors executed the Inca king Atahualpa in Peru, loyal Indian troops hid a vast cache of gold in a huaca (cave) in Mandango's side. Over the intervening centuries, the precise location of the huaca had been lost but, according to local folklore, at Easter during Semana Santa it would open to one of true heart. </p> <p>There was just one catch: the huaca was guarded by a cantankerous old man, a dog and a rooster. Every easter young Vilcabambans climbed the mountain and placed a cigarillo, a bone and a kernel of corn near the peak - the idea being that while the old man smoked the cigarillo, the dog was occupied with the bone and the rooster pecked at the corn, the entrance to the cave would reveal itself and they could rifle the gold. So far, however, no one had been quick enough. </p> <p>My son was fascinated by the story, the more so when we arrived at a small farmstead at the foot of the mountain and found our way blocked by an ill-tempered dog. We had no bone with us but fortunately we had brought some local toffee. Scattering it in the animal's path, we hurried up the steep gravel path leading to the summit - a grassy knoll with sheer chalk sides which in profile resembled a man's nose and mouth. It was my daughter who finally found a route to the top, clawing her way up by her fingernails. </p> <p>There was no gold there but we discovered something just as valuable: a 360-degree panorama. To the west we could just make out the old Inca trail running along the Cordillera de los Chillos, to the east the dropping peaks of the lower Ecuadorian Andes, and, sandwiched in between draped in mist, Vilcabamba, the so-called Valley of Eternal Youth. </p> <p>Later that evening my son described the outing in his diary. \"We climbed a mountain that looks like a man's face. It is called Cerro Mandango. We walked through clouds.\" </p> <p>It may not have been poetry exactly but every word was perfectly spelt. A few days later, we obtained a working internet connection and learned that Olivia had been offered a place at her first-choice school. We emailed her acceptance immediately, then returned to the Pole House and toasted her the only way we could - with a banana and passion fruit smoothie. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Mark Honigsbaum is the author of Valverde's Gold: a true tale of greed, obsession and grit, published by Macmillan at \u00a318.99.

  "<p> <strong>1.09pm</strong> Afternoon all, and can I just say how glad I am to b... ach! What am I saying? I'm hung over, and there's an end on't. Golf kicks off in a minute, and if anyone would like to suggest a soothing picture - bearing in mind I shall ignore anything with the phrase 'The O.C.' in it - email away.</p> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> Garcia and Westwood are taking on DiMarco and Haas in the day's first four-ball match, and already your emails are flooding in. Erm, hang on, they aren't doing anything of the sort. Fix up, please. The Europeans have rather fetching white caps: if anyone knows where I can get hold on one - NB to European golf PRs - you know what to do.</p> <p><strong>1.17pm</strong> All four players leather their tee shots safely down the fairway, and set off in hot, or at least tepid, pursuit. I'm more interested in the adverts for Gillette's new battery-powered razors. Some would say that with a rather pikey rash of gingery hair adorning the lower segment of my face, I might be well advised to get my hands on one. Pah - I defy the detractors.</p> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Lee Westwood's second shot lands near the pin, but the ball dribbles away down the green's camber. Haas does likewise. Several rednecks whoop.</p> <p><strong>1.27pm</strong> \"The only reason for watching golf,\" remarks Oliver Morgan, \"is to hope that someone in the crowd calls Colin Montgomerie a fat Scottish cuckold, which he is.\" Hardly charitable, but both funny and true; moreover the only contribution so far, and thus worthy of inclusion. Jay Haas birdies the first hole with a fantastic putt, to put the Americans one up. Ian 'Donald, Where's Me Troosers' Poulter pulls his tee shot well left, as does Darren Clarke. Cue more redneck yelps.</p> <p><strong>1.29pm</strong> Riley lands in the bunker, but Tiger Woods creams his drive delightfully down the fairway. Cue even more rednec.. etc.</p> <p><strong>1.34pm</strong> \"My internet link is costing me $20\", says David Keech, \"so your commentary had better be good!\" David is obviously unfamiliar with my work. In case you're joining late, the Seppos are one up thanks to Jay Haas in the first group; the second lot - with the exception of Tiger Woods - are busy making a frightful meal of the first hole. I am hung over, Monty has already been abused by one of our correspondents, and that, by my estimation, means that all is well with the world.</p> <p><strong>1.39pm</strong> Ian Poulter, whose hair I am considering copying to set off my fiery beard, recovers from a dodgy tee shot to find a good position on the green. On the second hole, Lee Westwood overshoots the pin and the ball runs away down the back of the green.</p> <p><strong>1.43pm</strong> Tiger Woods misses his birdie putt by <em>this</em> much. No, <em><strong>this</strong></em> much. The Eurorookies tee off in the third match, with David Howell and Paul Casey both finding the middle of the fairway safely.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> Chad Campbell looks like the lad who did the truffle shuffle in a film I watched when I was young. It was either The Goonies or The Lost Boys. Someone help me out...? Anyway, he lands his drive in the rough. Meanwhile, the Americans are one up in both of the first two matches.</p> <p><strong>1.47pm</strong> Lee Westwood guffs the chance of a four-foot putt to win the par-five second. The useless little beggar.</p> <p> <strong>1.51pm</strong> David Howell and Paul Casey are playing exceptionally well on the first hole, as indeed they need to. Eurpoe's final pair - Monty and Paddy Harrington - are delivered to the first tee in a rather lovely looking buggy.</p> <p><strong>1.57pm</strong> \"Has the axis of evil, Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld, arrived to cheer on their fellow Republicans against Old Europe?\" wonders Rob Hisnay, whose surname I swear is a staple of Snoop Dogg's peculiar vocabulary. Erm, I haven't spotted them, although if it was America v Afghanistan, I'm sure they'd be hanging around the 18th for an impromptu invasio.. actually that's a dreadful gag, isn't it? It's all square in the third group at the first, by the way.</p> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> \"I really, really hope you are the guy I went to college with,\" says Jack Thorne. Oh dear, a blast from the shameful past. \"If so you'll remember what you did to Vanessa's face.\" This really isn't as bad as it sounds. Or at least not as bad as it might have been. Erm, erm... Haas, on the fourth, plays a brave shot out of the rough, which shoots past the pin to leave him with a tough putt. Dimarco atones with a far better shot to within four feet.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> Jack again - this time without such an appalling allusion to my appalling past. \"For someone who clearly spent most of his life modelling himself on Ralph Mouth you really should know that the 'Truffle Shuffle' is from the Goonies,\" he says, directing us to <a href=\"www.coreyfeldman.com\">www.coreyfeldman.com</a>. \"The celebrity friends bit is the best bit of the site.\" He's not joking. \"The guy's a living legend.\" Oh, and there's golf on, too. Sergio Garcia putts for birdie, but misses. </p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Darren Clarke birdies to haul the Americans back to one in front after three. Marcus Thorpe, meanwhile, has a treat in store for us: a rather fetching picture of Chunk, engaged in the famous Truffle Shuffle. Watch this space. Or that one on the right, anyway.</p> <p><strong>2.19pm</strong> Furyk and Campbell are all square with Casey and Howell after they halve second, while Colin Montgomerie and Padraig Harrington are one down after the first. I'd tell you more, but I'm busy cropping the Truffle Shuffle picture. Let's be honest, that's what you came here for. Bear with me...</p> <p><strong>2.26pm</strong> Colin Montgomerie is on the second, shading his eyes from the early Detroit sunlight. And clobbering a golf ball down the fairway with consummate ease, naturally. The Americans are having very much the better of the first morning, with Tiger Woods is particular looking happy not to have Phil Mickelson lumbering around and spoiling his mojo.</p> <p><strong>2.31pm</strong> A cacophony of whooping greets a birdie by Jay Haas on the fifth hole, which puts the Americans one up.</p> <p><strong>2.35pm update:</strong> </p> <p>(1 up) DiMarco/Haas 5 Garcia/W'wood 5 <br> (1 up) Woods/Riley 4 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 3 Casey/Howell (all square)<br> (1 up) Cink/Love 2 Monty/Har'ton<br></p> <p><strong>2.42pm</strong> Davis Love III, in the bottom game, pays a lovely shot to within a couple of feet of the pin. Cink tries to do the same, but ends up overshooting. Padraig Harrington rescues things for Europe after Montie pulls his tee shot wide, but the pressure is firmly on the Europeans in all four of the games.</p> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong> Lee Westwood misses a fairly straightforward short putt on the sixth - America go two up, whilst Tiger Woods holes a beauty on the fifth - Aerica, once more, go two up. As my hangover drains of most of its early exuberance, I'm starting to feel horribly jaded. Entertain your poor correspondent, please.</p> <p><strong>2.51pm</strong> A lot of the players are having trouble with a tight entrance to the green on the third hole. Tiger Woods and Ian Poulter find the left and right bunkers respectively. The Americans, by the way, are wearing pink taffeta ball gowns and glitzy tiaras...</p> <p><strong>2.55pm</strong> ..of course they're not. They're wearing rather fetching red-and-black polo shirts and matching caps. But taffeta would be a lot more fun, eh? They're two up in both of the first two games, and good for it, too. Lee Westwood is fighting back, though, with a lovely approach shot on the seventh.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> Poulter makes a three on the sixth, but Woods is equal to it, and the Americans stay two ahead in the second game. \"What is the composition of the perfect fry-up?\" wonders Duncan Apple. \"I say three sausages (meaty, rather than of the saveloy/frankfurter school), two bacon, beans, two hash browns, one toast, and, [daringly, I think] a piece of good black pudding.\" Interesting, although not at all a bad thing, to see that Duncan disdains both eggs and mushrooms. If anyone wishes to debate this, now is your chance.</p> <p><strong>3.05pm</strong> Monty and Harrington go two down after four, with Monty fluffing his putt to put the pressure on Davis Love III. Bah! \"You could be doing minute-by-minute commentary of Man City-Crystal Palace instead of the Ryder Cup,\" expostulates Robert Hisnay, without making it clear whether this is a taunt or reassurance.</p> <p><strong>3.16pm</strong> Sorry for the brief interruption. I would blame technical troubles, but you'd all see straight through to the heart of the matter - my own woeful torpor. You've missed ... not a great deal. Europe are still playing miserably, losing holes to par (Monty and Harrington) and putting like duffers (Clarke and Poulter) I should imagine that Debbie Archer has heard the Radio 4 gags for most of her life. The poor girl. \"Whats the ugly chick off the Crankies got to do with golf?\" she asks, raising a smile, but missing the point of all this by several feet.</p> <p> <strong>3.19pm</strong> Two gorgeous shots from the Westwood and Garcia, to land within good distance of the pin on the par-three ninth. \"Before a playful subject gets miles off the rails,\" interjects Daniel Musgrave, with some venom, \"I feel I must interject with some venom.\" Go ahead... \"BEANS??? What good is a fry up with some hideous tinned tasteless slop drowning everything with its baby food features? Scrambled eggs heavy on butter, NO milk, and a crispy piece of fried bread (not pre-sliced white pap). Enough said.\" Right you are.</p> <p><strong>3.22pm</strong> Riley puts for par and halves the seventh to keep the Americans two shots in front. </p> <p><strong>3.26pm: Lazy min-by-min commentator decides to let a score-card do the talking, as rapidly diminishing audience heave sighs of relief to be rid of tedious twitterings for just a few minutes</strong><br> (1 up) DiMarco/Haas 8 Garcia/W'wood 5 <br> (2 up) Woods/Riley 7 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 6 Casey/Howell (1 up)<br> (2 up) Cink/Love 5 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>3.33pm</strong>The Woods/Riley v Clarke/Poulter match is heating up, with some good putting on both sides. They're on the eighth, with Clarke playing a decent escape shot from the bunker to run up to the pin. </p> <p><strong>3.39pm</strong> Good recovery shot from Garcia to get out of the rough and onto the green at the tenth. But attention is on Davis Love III, who sinks his fourth birdie of the morning to put the Americans three up in the last pair.</p> <p><strong>3.47pm</strong> \"I think it is possible to make up Motown sounding song titles using the names of the Ryder Cup players,\" says David O'Doherty. \"Riley, Haas Love Cink? (albeit a Japanese cover band song title)\" I won't pretend I have the faintest idea what this means. The second pairs halve the ninth, with the Americans two up.</p> <p><strong>3.51pm</strong> The first pairs halve the tenth, with the Americans still one up. Hal Sutton appears on the television to express his satisfaction with what he's watching, and to look a little bit like Simon Weston. \"Good luck with the hangover,\" says Elena Papazoglou, who has the best email address I've ever seen, \"I always find a can of pina colada from Marks and Spencers does the trick, then a nice snooze on the floor of the disabled loo at work!\"</p> <p><strong>3.56pm</strong> Finally Monty wins a hole - the seventh - for Europe. They're two down now, which is better than a welly in the clackers, and more pertinently, better than three down. My profuse thanks to Jason Reid, who has sent me not only two grand pictures, but this instructive passage. \"Grown men and women willingly poison themselves with glass after glass of alcohol in order to feel comfortable being themselves. Why suffer the hangover? There's no more disarming activity than golf, no better way to break down protective exteriors.\"</p> <p> <strong>4.07pm</strong> After the Americans dominated the front nine, Europe seem to be coming back into the match. Garcia putts well to win the eleventh, and square the first match.<br> DiMarco/Haas 11 Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> (2 up) Woods/Riley 10 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 8 Casey/Howell (1 up)<br> (2 up) Cink/Love 7 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>4.14pm</strong> After an age of jiggling around and shaking his posterior, Jim Furyk putts on the ninth and misses, handing the initiative to the Europeans. Haas, on the other hand absolutely clobbers the ball down the twelfth fairway, to put himself in with a decent chance to make eagle.</p> <p><strong>4.16pm</strong> Chad Campbell rescues the Americans after Furyk's miss to halve the ninth. Harrington, meanwhile knocks a fairly short putt home to halve the eighth. Monty and Paddy stay two down.</p> <p><strong>4.23pm</strong> Sergio Garcia birdies the twelfth. Then titters all round, as a group of squirrels scamper playfully around the ninth tee. If anyone can let me know the collective noun for squirrels, I'd feel a lot happier. In the meantime, I'm simply glad that this is on Sky, and not the BBC, whose paroxysms of delight at that sort of thing would probably have broken me. In addition to which, none of you televisually disadvantaged would be spending your Saturday in my company. </p> <p><strong>4.26pm</strong> Despite Haas' great chance to make eagle, he can't quite sink the four-foot putt required, and the first match moves on to the thirteenth hole all square.</p> <p><strong>4.32pm</strong> A fifteen-foot putt from Casey puts the Europeans two up after the tenth. The rookies are outclassing Furyk and Campbell.</p> <p><strong>4.34pm</strong> 'Wifey' informs me that the collective noun for squirrels is a dray. Or possibly a drey, we're not sure. I'm not totally convinced, either. Can anyone affirm or debunk?</p> <p><strong>4.40pm</strong> Jay Haas is playing out of his wrinkly old skin. He fends off the recent rally of Garcia and Westwood, and keeps the first game all square. Unfortunately a birdie from Riley on the twelfth has Clarke and Poulter three down.</p> <p><strong>4.43pm</strong> We have a difference of opinion over squirrels. Despite some early support for the dray, we have this from Ian Magilton: \"A dray is where they live,\" explains Ian. \"The collective name for squirrels is a coven (if they are red) and a hoard if they are grey, or in America, where they come from, they're referred to as a bunch.\"</p> <p><strong>4.46pm</strong> Furyk and Campbell win the eleventh to haul a point back from the European rookies. \"The bloke who wrote in re fried breakfast,\" begins George Woods, \"has highlighted a real problem. That is, the sort of person who says, 'I have got a terrible hangover and really need a fry-up to make me better.' A terrible hangover means you cannot breathe, see, drink water or slow the heart beyond about 120 beats per minute. That is why I have yet to ingest anything yet today and this screen is flickering like a 19th century Blackpool dirty postcard machine.\"</p> <p> <strong>4.53pm</strong> Lee Westwood pars the fourteenth to put the pressure on the Americans to halve the hole. No problem for Haas, who holds his nerve and a tricky putt to keep the first match all square.</p> <p><strong>4.57pm: Journalistic charlatan pulls the same stunt as he did at 3.26pm</strong><br> DiMarco/Haas 14 Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> (4 up) Woods/Riley 13 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 11 Casey/Howell (1 up)<br> (2 up) Cink/Love 10 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>5pm</strong> \"You might be interested to know,*\"says Andrew Cosgrove, \"that the adjective for 'pertaining to or like a squirrel' is sciurine.\" I am, Andrew, so no need for the caveat: \"*but then again you may not.\"</p> <p><strong>5.05pm</strong> Now, listen up, this is important. I'd like to carry out a social experiment. I want everyone reading this to think about, hum, and sing Whigfield's early-90s hit 'Saturday Night'. Go out tonight, and sing it to everyone you see, and encourage them to do the same to everyone they see. And if anyone comes up to me in Soho tonight and sings a line of 'Saturday Night' I will buy them the drink of their choice. That, and only that, will alleviate the self-inflicted agony that I have of having it stuck in my head. Ian Poulter, meanwhile, wins the thirteenth for Europe to pull a point back. The third match, meanwhile, is all square. </p> <p><strong>5.11pm</strong> Sergio Garcia pars the fifteenth to give Lee Westwood a free putt from about thirty feet. And he <em>almost</em> makes it. In the end, the first group head for the sixteenth still all square.</p> <p><strong>5.17pm</strong> Furyk and Campbell sink three consecutive birdies to really take the third game away from Casey and Howell. The scorecard looks ominously lopsided for the Europeans: <br>DiMarco/Haas 15 Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> (3 up) Woods/Riley 14 Clarke/Poulter<br> (1 up) Furyk/Campbell 13 Casey/Howell <br> (2 up) Cink/Love 11 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>5.24pm</strong> Harrington misses his third putt in a row, and the final pair go three down on the twelfth. But there's the <strong>first result of the day</strong>: Woods and Chris Riley defeat Clarke and Poulter by 4&amp;3, to take the overall score to 2.5 - 6.5</p> <p><strong>5.31pm</strong> DiMarco sinks a fifteen-foot putt on the sixteenth green to put the pressure on Sergio Garcia to keep Europe in with some hope of a point from this morning. No problem.</p> <p><strong>5.36pm</strong> Sergio Garcia tees off on the seventeenth with an enormous groan of 'Come on'. The ball follows his orders, and rolls down the back of the green towards the pin. Westwood is less fortunate, whereas DiMarco overshoots the green completely and is lucky to avoid the bunker.</p> <p><strong>5.44pm</strong> Sergio Garcia has a wonderful chance to go one up on the seventeenth after DiMarco misses his tricky shot. But he bottles it, and misses the hole by several inches. The big bottling bottler. Onwards to the eighteenth.</p> <p><strong>5.54pm</strong> Techie problems have kept me from informin... actually, see 3.16pm. Cink lands an easy putt to halve the fourteenth. Love and Cink look well set at three ahead.</p> <p><strong>6.04pm</strong> Oh dear. after much contemplation, Sergio Garcia tries to overhit the eighteenth pin and roll the ball back. But he goes too hard at it and ends up about fifty feet away. Westwood, from a similar position, gets it right and ends up with a ten footer to negotiate.</p> <p><strong>6.06pm</strong> Oh my word! Garcia takes his putt first and holes it for bogey. That was the moment of the day - an absolutely incredible putt that puts enormous pressure on Haas... which tells, as he misses the putt for par. On the sixteenth, meanwhile, Campbell is busy sinking his birdie putt.</p> <p><strong>6.10pm</strong> The top match ends <strong>all square</strong>, as Westwood misses his birdie putt by a whisker.</p> <p><strong>6.12pm scoreboard</strong><br> DiMarco/Haas F Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> 4&amp;3 Woods/Riley F Clarke/Poulter<br> (1 up) Furyk/Campbell 16 Casey/Howell<br> (3 up) Cink/Love 15 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>6.22pm</strong> Howell has a putt to birdie the seventeenth, and he makes it to jubilation all round - well, on the European side at least, as they square the match going in to the eighteenth. Given the way the day has gone, it would be no bad thing for Europe to finish the morning with a deficit of just 2-1.</p> <p><strong>6.23pm</strong> Another cracking putt to seal a result, as Cink lands one from the edge of the sixteenth green to <strong>win the bottom match</strong> by 3&amp;2.</p> <p><strong>6.29pm</strong> Monty admits on't telly that he asked to be left out of this afternoon's matches, as he was knacked this morning, the lamb. So his run of 30 consecutive Ryder Cup matches comes to an end.</p> <p><strong>6.42pm</strong> It's all tense on the eighteenth green, as Furyk and Campbell try to suss their chances of stealing the most up-and-down of the day's matches. </p> <p><strong>6.47pm</strong> Chad Campbell double-bogeys the eighteenth and leave Paul Casey with the chance to putt for par, and <strong>a point Europe looked unlikely to get</strong> a few hours ago... and he makes it!</p> <p><strong>6.48pm</strong> Well, that settles the morning session.

  "<p>Abergavenny - or Y Fenni in Welsh - lies hugged by a bend in the river Usk, and dominated by the Blorenge, a great heathery hill that rears up to the southwest. For a few days every September the quiet, leafy little town bursts into an almost tropical bloom with the celebration of the Abergavenny Food Festival. </p> <p>I like Abergavenny; the country round about is beautiful, with its river and its hills. And festival or no, you can always get a good feed, because as a result of some unfathomable glitch in the space/time continuum, the place is alive with top Italian chefs who run exquisite country restaurants and hotels (the first was Franco Taruschio who set up the Walnut Tree Inn with his wife Ann, though it is now under new ownership). And these Italians, having set themselves up, have magnanimously showed everybody else how to do it, resulting in one of the best concentrations of board and bed anywhere in the land. It may be this singular phenomenon that gave rise to the festival, and thus by extension to my presence here. </p> <p>I was whisked to the Market Hall, the nerve centre of the proceedings, to witness the Fanfare for the Festival. There was a medieval feel to the thing as we sat - hundreds of us - at trestle tables and fell eagerly upon the tender young pigs that had been prepared for our delectation by a team of spectacularly good chefs. In order to assist the passage of the pork, there were wines from everywhere - even Wales itself - and sinister ciders, and unexpectedly beautiful beers. Beers, I soon learned, that were produced by passionate men burning the midnight oil in their microscopic breweries in order that the subtle magic of brewing be not lost to the dull machinations of the industrialised conglomerates. You could taste the passion in it. I don't even like beer very much, but by the time a few of these brewers had had their way with me, their fruity brown beers became the quintessence of all that was lovable about mankind. </p> <p>As we, the revellers, addressed ourselves to this fabulous fare, we were entertained by musicians of every persuasion, starting with a Welsh choir that made me weep into my beer - these people know how to sing - and culminating with a Salsa band. </p> <p>At the end of a long evening I crept to my bed, glistening with pork and awash with beer. Of course, I didn't sleep a wink; I lay awake thinking about the festival and what it was all about ... was it just another scam to gull the public into injecting a load of cash into a lumbering local economy? - which, let's face it, some festivals are - or was it more than that? </p> <p>I was oiled and fired up that night, and these are the conclusions I came to: here was a hotbed of gastronomic anarchy; these people were flying in the face of health and safety council directives, barefacedly flouting the laws and regulations imposed by the British government and the EU. Unlike the usual whingeing British way, they were taking leaves from Spanish and French books - if they can't see the sense in a law, they'd ignore it. </p> <p>All these regulations - the straightness of cucumbers, the conformity of apples, the detestable cellophane wrapper ... the thousand and more nonsensical regulations forced upon us by the lobbying of the industrial food-producing conglomerates, to ensure that nobody but themselves gets a look in ... all these were being joyously flouted. This festival was an exuberant celebration of what good food should be about, prepared by people who understand and love what they're doing, for people who know how to appreciate it. Here were the small producers, the family farm, the gifted enthusiast, the privately run restaurant, putting one over on the gargantuan consortia who seek through their power and political influence to give us no alternative to the loveless anodyne pap that they would foist upon us. </p> <p>And these were not people who would return us to a dark age of ill health and dangerously dirty food habits, but those who would seek to preserve the quality, the art and the skill that make food both nourishing and pleasurable. </p> <p>In the morning I arose with this premise boiling in my head, and set out to prove it. By the time I got back to the town people were pouring in, marshalled by big, shiny-faced farm boys down from the hills for the day. The sun warmed them and made them glad as they strolled among the street players. It was glorious, the streets were alive with music, from string quartets to fiddlers and folk bands, and a dazzling guitar and saxophone duo. This is the way urban life ought to be, I thought to myself. The sunshine and the music, and the food and drink and the good nature of the mild-mannered border-folk, all went to weave a Mediterranean spell upon the place. </p> <p>And then there were the events. There was a sushi demonstration where I learned - as I'd really known all along - that what I served up at home in the guise of sushi was nothing more than cold rice-pudding wrapped in damp seaweed. There were cookery demonstrations of every hue, and I hung transfixed upon the lips of the demonstrators. There were debates, too, in pubs, with mugs of beer and a jolly rabble, and speaches from the big cheeses in the world of food and catering. </p> <p>My head fuddled by debate, and equally convinced by all passionately opposing views, I headed back to the Market Hall. Here now was haberdashery and bookshops, and fresh Thai food, as well as home-made pies and butties and pasties. Cakes and jams, cheeses and honey, mushrooms and succulent Welsh meat and a huge array of other victuals were there, too, to gladden the hungry heart. </p> <p>But out the back in the market yard was for me the finest thing of the whole festival. You may think I'm obsessed with pork, and indeed maybe I am, because I think that a well roast pig is a hot contender for the very acme of human felicity - and you can't get roast pork in Spain, where I live. What it was, was a huge golden pig. It was roasted on a spit by a team of the jolliest folks who ever stuck and roasted a porker. It was crisp and crackly, the meat rich and sweet and all the most glorious golden brown. You could buy a piece of this pig and put it in a butty with some apple sauce. I never ate such pork, and I can no longer think of Abergavenny without that sweet golden pig swimming into view. </p> <p>In the castle grounds there was a cocktail bar in a tent on the lawn, and home made ice-cream with sheep's milk - and an engaging couple of slatterns (yes, that is the word), who, over an open fire were cooking food from the middle ages in flagrant violation of every health and safety directive ever issued. Mostly blackberries and gruel, it was. These slatterns spoke only in medieval English; you couldn't catch them out - to the extent that they had me believing that they had dropped in through some warp in the weft of time. </p> <p>I liked the people here, too; they seemed a gentle, poetical people. They do English with the most appealing lilt and fill it with their own particular mollifiers and considerate circumlocutions. A sign on the door of the theatre where I went to see the performing poet, John Hegley - whom don't miss - said: \"Would you mind shutting the door as quietly as possible, please.\" </p> <p>And this year the festival is to be illuminated by the performances of the incomparable Peter Blegvad. </p> <p>Ay, Abergavenny ... just try and keep me away! </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chris Stewart is the author of A Parrot In The Pepper Tree and Driving Over Lemons, published by Sort Of Books.</p> <p><strong>Festival highlights</strong></p> <p><strong> Today</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</strong> delivers his Meat Manifesto.<br>2pm, Borough Theatre </p> <p><strong>Elisabeth Luard</strong>.

  "<p>This month has been a disappointing one for fans of horror games. <a href=\"http://www.doom3.com/\">Doom 3</a> promised to be the most terrifying of all time, but merely took us back to a world of scary monsters and haunted houses. For all its admittedly impressive graphical technology, the game design can only be seen as reactionary compared to the surreal psychological horrors offered up by Konami's <a href=\"http://www.silenthillheaven.com/Site/Main/main.php\">Silent Hill</a>, Tecmo's <a href=\"http://www.fatalframe.com/\">Fatal Frame</a> or more recently Sony's <a href=\"http://www.forbidden-siren.com/\">Forbidden Siren</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>For several years these Japanese titles have been appropriating themes from mythology, schlock horror movies, expressionist art, traditional ghost stories and countless other media to generate deeply unsettling images and experiences. Even the more mainstream Resident Evil, which, like Doom 3, makes great use of juvenile shock tactics, also explores concepts of body horror and the supernatural \u2013 and as with any zombie movie, it plays on innate human fears and revulsion of our own post-mortem decay. Which is more impressive than throwing a flaming skull at the screen and expecting us to crap ourselves.</p> <p>But now even our favourite Japanese horror series are beginning to let us down. Silent Hill 4, with its emphasis on action, is a pale imitation of its relentlessly weird predecessors which often left you wandering for ages with nothing scarier than radio static to keep you on edge. And <a href=\"http://www.capcom.com/outbreak/\">Resident Evil Outbreak</a> is a joke in Europe, robbed of its key selling point \u2013 online co-operative play - which would have allowed gamers to explore the tense self-destructive group dynamic that has formed the basis of American horror cinema from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre right through to modern wannabes like Cabin Fever and Wrong Turn. Interestingly, Resident Evil 4 \u2013 perhaps influenced by those two recent movies - seems to be ditching zombies in favour of inbred yokels as the baddie of choice. Is Capcom looking to study metropolitan fears of rural folk? Or is this an attempt to push the series even further into the mainstream by providing more recognisable enemies? Perhaps the survival horror genre is simply morphing into the currently more in-vogue stealth shooter. That really <em>would</em> be a nightmare. What next? Resident Evil: Vice City?</p> <p>If this shift toward action and away from suspense and psychological horror proves pervasive, it will be a real loss. Videogames have a unique capacity to explore fear. Through their very interactivity they force us into a closer relationship with the hero and his/her situation \u2013 and unlike with movies, we can't hide behind the sofa when we're guiding Claire Redfield, we can't shout at the idiot character for going into the cellar alone, because <em>we're</em> the ones pushing them down there. And with forty hours of game play available in which to manipulate the audience, the videogame designer has a much larger canvas to work with than the horror movie director.</p> <p>The game developer can also use peripheral detail much more effectively than the movie director, knowing that the audience \u2013 able to explore at will - will have time to notice everything. In Silent Hill 2, for example, there are walls daubed with blood, strange signs on hospital walls, viscera in the toilet bowl \u2013 the gamer has time to notice them all, gorging on atmosphere. With the stylistically comparable movie, Se7en, the viewer could only hope to catch a tiny minority of the ambient horrors David Fincher litters in each scene without recourse to multiple viewings.</p> <p>There's far too much potential in the videogame format, then, for horror to slip entirely out of the developers' canon. Fortunately, there are signs that designers are finding new ways to scare, and new dark themes to explore. Free Radical Design's stealth adventure <a href=\"http://www.codemasters.co.uk/secondsight/\">Second Sight</a> plays with para-psychological horror via its hero John Vattic who has violent telekinetic powers \u2013 recalling seventies shockers like Carrie and The Medusa Touch. And of course Rockstar's Manhunt \u2013which on the surface appears to be just a pointlessly violent action adventure \u2013 is all about moral horror: it puts us into extreme situations and asks, 'how far will you go?'. Like Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness it wants to know what happens when the restraining bolts of culture and social ethics are removed from the average person. When we step into the shoes of James Earl Cash we're testing our primal instincts, staring into the id and whatever horrors it holds.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Midway's <a href=\"http://www.thesuffering.midway.com/\">The Suffering</a>, set in a haunted prison, made a rather cack-handed attempt to explore themes of madness and paranoia. It could have been so much better and surely there is a rich mine of material here. Imagine a game where the lead character faces a descent into madness, where anything you see on screen could be a paranoid hallucination \u2013 imagine an interactive version of Jacob's Ladder, The Shining or David Cronenberg 's Videodrome. On the subject of Cronenberg, the concept of <a href=\"http://body-horror.wikiverse.org/\">gruesome metamorphosis</a> as explored in his late-seventies parasite movies Rabid and Shivers would make great material for a videogame. We glimpsed these ideas occasionally in Vivendi's very good translation of The Thing with its scenes of man to monster transmogrification. Expanded to become the main gameplay focus, I can imagine a survival horror romp where you control a character who must locate some sort of antidote to reverse a Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde-style mutation. If nothing else, it would be a potent comment on, and analysis of our current obsession with cosmetic surgery.</p> <p>The Thing, by the way, also used a trust/fear meter to represent the psychological state of the characters - an interesting concept that forces you to worry about your avatar on both a mental and physical level. A similar concept appears in Capcom's <a href=\"http://www.capcom.com/xpml/game.xpml?gameid=750020\">Clock Tower 3</a>, where lead character Alyssa suffers blurred vision and becomes almost uncontrollable when her panic meter rises to maximum, a very compelling attempt to simulate the subjectivivity of mental anguish. Gamers are used to having absolute trust of, and control over, the lead character, so to have this umbilical connection severed, even momentarily, causes quite a psychological jolt (see also the simulation of temporary deafness and blurred vision in Rainbow Six when your soldier strays too close to a bomb blast).</p> <p>So the big horror franchises are going off the boil, but there are interesting ideas bubbling underneath as developers play with the latest graphical and visual technologies to simulate alternate mental states and to explore new themes. Where will they look for narrative inspiration next? In the current climate of real world horror \u2013 of terrorism, protest and natural disaster \u2013 what need have we for zombies and psychological demons? Are videogame developers merely pausing and adapting to exploit topical themes and real-life terrors? Videogames with suicide bombers, corrupt politicians, hospital super bugs, alcohol-fuelled violence, refugee camps, ethnic war\u2026 The horror. The horror.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Budgetary bliss</strong></p> <p>Exotic foreign spas usually come with scattered orchid petals, lemongrass rubs and a price tag to seriously unbalance your chakra. Well there's now a solution that avoids long-haul flights and jet lag - and its cost shouldn't shatter your serenity. </p> <p>Edinburgh's One Spa has been laden down with awards since opening three years ago. But it's not the rebalancing facial or salt and oil rub that let you cash in, it's the architecturally stunning spa's unique collection of global heat treatments. </p> <p>For \u00a355 you get four hours in the thermal suite, including an Italian laconium (dry sauna with heated seats), Turkish hammam and a tropical rain shower worthy of Bali. There's also an Alpine ice drench, Finnish sauna, herb-scented \"aroma grotto\" straight off a Thai island and cold mist drizzle found in Skegness in February. </p> <p>It's not exactly scientific - but nor are heated stones and swinging crystals - but a quick back of the napkin calculation suggests you might spend \u00a3400 each on weekends in Rome, Helsinki, Istanbul and the French Alps, at least a grand on trips to Thailand and Bali, and about \u00a350 getting to Skegness. </p> <p>Use a budget airline to fly to the Edinburgh spa, and that's a saving of about \u00a33,550 - or 118 multi-coloured mud treatments. And you won't have to splash out on a massage for jet lag or post-flight wrinkles.

  "<p>I get up before dawn and drive east, across the Colorado River and into the sprawl and billboard landscape of Yuma (\"Foxy Vegetables Welcomes You!\", \"Visit The Yuma Territorial Prison\"). The motel parking lots are empty. The trailer parks and RV camps are deserted, all 300 of them. In summertime the population of Yuma shrinks by 50%, from 120,000 to about 60,000. </p> <p>I was here in January and the city, if that is the right word for it, was clogged and seething with nomadic retirees in motorhomes - \"snowbirds\", as the locals call them, a term that describes their southerly migration in winter and hints at their white plumage. There were vibrant encampments on these abandoned lots, a chirpy, wholesome, neighbourly, Eisenhower-generation feeling in the air - golf clothes and cocktail parties, bridge tournaments and shuffleboard contests, coffee klatches and quilting bees - and it is strange and eerie to see all of it gone, all of it evaporated by the heat. </p> <p>Towards the end of March, as the temperature climbs into the nineties, the spirit of migration moves through the flock. They pack up their satellite dishes and cocktail shakers, roll up their Astroturf lawns, and point the RVs north, chasing the perfect 80-degree day up and down the continent. The Mexican fruit and vegetable pickers, who work the irrigated farms around Yuma, have gone north too, chasing the harvest, and so perhaps have the troubadours and low-rent prostitutes who used to appear at their camps on payday. </p> <p>At the edge of the farms there is a line of transition. The bright, garish, incongruous swath of green ends at the last irrigation canal, and the native buffs, duns, tans, greys, khakis and pinks take over. Linear, rectangular space gives way to smooth, untrammelled space - nomad space - wide flat desert valleys and isolated, sawtoothed mountain ranges, with stands of tall, armed saguaro cactus growing on their flanks and foothills. The valleys measure 20 or 30 miles across, and out in the middle of them there are whirling columns of dust, raised up by the wind, spinning counter-clockwise like miniature tornadoes. They twirl and undulate and skid across the valley floors, gathering speed, until they blow apart and disappear, and another dust devil forms somewhere else. </p> <p>Nomad space: too far from the river to irrigate, too dry for crops or cities to take root. Like the deserts of the Bedouin, the Mongol steppes, the Tibetan plateaus or the buffalo plains, this is a harsh, marginal, wide-open landscape, with long horizons and a paucity of water. This was the homeland of the Sand Papago, or Hiaced O'Oodham as they called themselves, the last freeroaming hunter-gatherers in the lower 48 states to be brought to heel, at the close of the 19th century. Fifty years earlier this had been the westernmost range for the Western Apache raiding parties, attracted by the emigrant caravans travelling to the California goldfields. This, on the evidence of dust devils, is a place where the earth itself feels compelled to rise up and move. </p> <p>Even today, with the richest, most powerful, and most technologically advanced nation state in history behind it, sedentary civilisation has gained little more than a toehold on this stretch of desert. Every 30 miles or so, the interstate will reach a flyblown gas station, with a noisy air-conditioner and a few ramshackle trailers parked around it - a settlement dependent for its existence on passing travellers. I get stranded in one of them (Sentinel, Arizona) for two and a half hours, because the proprietor is sleeping off a hangover and my tank is close to empty. I consider waking him up and reconsider when I see the National Rifle Association stickers on the door, the scrawled promises in red ink to shoot all intruders and the scrawled boasts about intruders already shot. </p> <p>'Why would anyone want to live out here?\" wonders a Californian truck driver, stranded in the same predicament. Apart from a few surly outcasts, huddled around their air-conditioners and beer coolers, modern Americans, like Sand Papagos or Apaches, treat this desert as a place to be travelled across, a place where it feels wrong to be stationary. At 10.15, when the grizzled, wincing proprietor finally appears, driving the 50 yards between his trailer and the gas station, the temperature is already 100 degrees in the shade and rising steadily. </p> <p>Further east, as the interstate approaches Tucson, the mountain ranges grow taller and more impressive, rising up out of the desert to 8-9,000ft now, with a dark green mantle of pine forest around their summits. When storm systems track across southern Arizona, these \"sky island\" mountain ranges capture most of the precipitation, leaving the deserts around in a rain shadow. The mountains release water to the deserts as snowmelt and run off, encased within the banks of unreliable rivers and streams. </p> <p>The same process has shaped the geography of the American West as a whole: the Great Plains might also be described as the rain shadow of the Rocky mountains. The Mojave and the Great Basin desert in Nevada and Utah lie in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada.The arid plains of eastern Washington and Oregon are created by the rain-hogging Cascades. </p> <p>When it does rain on the deserts or the plains, it tends to be dramatic and unpredictable: a thunderstorm boiling up and dumping its contents on a small, localised area of land, rather than blanketing the whole region in rain. Grazing springs up in one place and shrivels away in another. Dry gulches roar into flash-flood, then return to dust and sand. Capricious rainfall patterns, temporary shifting zones of vegetation, seasonal temperature extremes, farflung and unreliable water sources - these too are characteristics shared by nomad lands all over the world. Historically, these were the lands ceded to the nomads by the emerging sedentary states, and nomadism was the logical way to stay alive on them. </p> <p>I think this type of landscape still activates the human desire for travel and mobility on some deep instinctual level, but I don't know how to prove it, and there are certainly exceptions. I think that's what happened to me in the American West, but I'm aware of other factors and more plausible explanations. </p> <p>A fascination with deserts and wandering tribes, for example, has been a recurrent phenomenon among the misfits of European civilisation, and among a certain class of well-educated Englishmen in particular. \"A part of their brain reflects the desert perfectly,\" writes Michael Ondaatje in The English Patient. \"The English have a great hunger for desolate places,\" says Alec Guinness playing a Bedouin chief in Lawrence of Arabia. I'm not about to compare my ramblings around the American West with the epic feats of T E Lawrence, or Doughty, Philby or Wilfred Thesiger, but I think I understand the compulsion that drove the English Arabists out into the deserts and the company of nomads. I think I know why they felt so restless and claustrophobic in England. </p> <p>Travel was in my family too. I come from imperialist stock: the Britons who wanted to get the hell out of Britain. My father, my paternal grandfather, and his father before him were Scottish by blood but born in India, Anglicised by the Raj, and they probably encountered some of my mother's English relatives at colonial functions and banquets. I was born in Malaysia, where my father made a good show of settling down after travelling across most of the world in his twenties. Then we moved to Kuwait, made extended visits around the Middle East before \"coming back\" to England, a country that was entirely foreign to me and reluctant to give me citizenship. My nationality was filed under \"Miscellaneous\" at the British Passport Office. </p> <p>It is a dreary, commonplace adage among the sedentary and stay-at-homes that people travel to escape from themselves. There is some truth in the old cliche, as there is in most, but if you spent your childhood on the move and with the big proviso that you and your family had a happy time doing it - then moving on feels the right and natural state of affairs, and assumes an air of inevitability. It's when you get stranded in one place for too long, at least in my case, that you start to feel divorced from yourself. Setting out on a journey, almost invariably, I have a sense of becoming whole again, of doubts and confusions lifting, and my self slotting back into place. </p> <p>I remember my childhood as a happy time, but my father started suffering from periodic depressions after we \"came back\" to England, and as I recall they usually coincided with the onset of winter. I knew about the English winter - the damp cold in your bones, the afternoon dark, the driving rain in your face, as if the elements had singled you out for persecution - but through the shielding efforts of my parents I knew very little about the downturns and redundancies at the office and the steady decline of the British shipbroking business, to which my father had attached his fortunes. </p> <p>I did notice that my father was restored to his old self, at least temporarily, by going on a trip to some sunny foreign country or other. He returned from abroad in fine spirits, with presents and stories to tell, and old reminiscences sparked - his time as a lumberjack in British Columbia in the 1940s, his heiress-hunting escapades in San Francisco in the 1950s, the old gambling, golfing, cocktail swilling days in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, the anecdotes and adventures from Spain, Italy, Mexico, Montreal, Vancouver, Cape Town, Burma, Indian, Ceylon, Thailand, the Philippines. Listening and watching, as the rain lashed the window panes, and my father told his stories and twirled his Scotch-and-water, it was clear to me that everything vivid and exciting in life happened in other countries. At no stage in my upbringing did it occur to me that I would live in England once I was old enough to leave. </p> <p>My urge to travel, and travel towards the sun, was foursquare in the family tradition, but the style of my travels, I suspect, included an element of rebellion against my background. I wasn't hunting tigers in India with a troop of native bearers and telling the story over a gin-and-quinine cocktail at the governor's mansion, like my grandfather. I wasn't chasing debutantes and craving a life in high society, like my father. I was slumming it around the redneck hinterlands in grubby jeans, hitch-hiking and riding freight trains, drinking in roadhouses and dive bars, sleeping in cars and flopping in the dirt. Growing up in houses filled with nice objets (Persian rugs, Chinese altar tables, antique silverware), and bombarded by consumerist advertising in Thatcher's London, I took pride in being able to carry my worldly possessions and replace them for less than $200 if necessary. </p> <p>To wake up by the side of the road somewhere, light a cigarette, and start pondering the decision of whether to set off north, south, east or west ... To be sitting in a New York bar and fall prey to a sudden urge to go to Texas, Montana or Mexico, and be able to leave in the morning without a care - this was my idea of freedom, this was my definition of success in life.</p> <p><strong>What the judges said </strong></p> <p>'Ghost Riders is about the strange world of thousands of nomadic American eccentrics,by a youthful author who shared their lifestyle.

  "<p>The other countryside alliance will take to the fells and moors tomorrow to celebrate the arrival of a new right to roam open land. </p> <p>Walkers will gather at Abbeystead in the Forest of Bowland, Lancashire, and the Goyt Valley in the Peak District, where the law increases land accessible to walkers by 35%. </p> <p>Both areas are typical of the wild, open country which the new law opens up, essentially permitting walkers to leave designated public rights of way and wander at will. </p> <p>The events also include a welcoming contribution from landowners such as Yorkshire Water, which is throwing a joint party with ramblers, and the Moorland Association which has published a new access code with the motto Respect, Protect and Enjoy. </p> <p>Other groups, such the Country Landowners Association, remain cautious about the rights, particularly the possibility of problems over compensation for damage and insurance liability. </p> <p>But there was a consensus yesterday that the issue should be separated from the storm over hunting, although Countryside Alliance protesters are expected to dog the main celebration events. </p> <p>The Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales, which are supervising plans of newly open areas, are ready for some initial confusion. </p> <p>The new law enormously extends the amount of countryside where walkers may legally go, but is limited to \"mountain, moorland, heath, down and registered common land\". </p> <p>This does not include most cultivated land, largely in lowland Britain, where existing arrangements of public footpaths and permitted access by agreement with landowners or farmers will remain the rule. </p> <p>Other areas exempted include Ministry of Defence ranges, sensitive forestry, specialist farming and some nature reserves. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 does not apply in Scotland, although new legislation there has granted similar rights. </p> <p>Tomorrow sees the new law come into force in the first two of eight \"mapping areas\" organised by the Countryside Agency. </p> <p>The Lower North West covers most of Lancashire, a small part of Cumbria south of the A65, parts of North and West Yorkshire), Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cheshire, parts of Staffordshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire in the Peak District National Park, and parts of north-west Derbyshire that border the park. </p> <p>The South East covers Surrey, Kent, West Sussex, East Sussex, south London boroughs of Hillingdon, Hounslow, Richmond, Kingston, Merton, Sutton, Croydon, Bromley and Bexley. </p> <p>Boundary agreements in the rest of the England and Wales are due to be completed, and access opened by the end of next year. </p> <p>Precise details of the \"access land\" will be shown on 32 new maps being prepared by the Ordnance Survey. The almost four-year delay between the passing of the act in November 2000 and its implementation has been taken up with consultations and provisional maps. </p> <p>The struggle for access goes back to 1884. The campaign's most famous moment came with the mass trespass on Kinder Scout in the Derbyshire Peak in 1932, when ramblers fought pitched battles with gamekeepers. </p> <p>In spite of the length of the struggle, dozens of advances were made along the way, notably the creation of national parks in 1949, with the Peak District the first. </p> <p>\"It will be a truly historic day for the countryside,\" said Nick Barrett, chief executive of the Ramblers' Association which is organising the celebrations in Bowland and the Peak. </p> <p>\"For many the joy of walking is about getting off the beaten track; everybody in this country now has a right to do just that and I hope people will take the opportunity to discover these beautiful areas for themselves.\" </p> <p><strong>These routes are made for walking ...</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> One of the best areas in the Peak District is the Dragon's Back hills south of Buxton, an area with little access land in the past compared with the national park. Tomorrow, fellsides will link Hollins Hill, Chrome Hill, Parkhouse Hill, Hitter Hill and High Wheeldon (route on Ordnance Survey Explorer OL24). The newly open areas connect well with existing rights of way and villages and hamlets once hard to reach due to trespassing law </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In Lancashire, walkers can tramp across the Forbidden Moor - Burn Moor south-east of High Bentham, five miles east of the A65 'Road to the Lakes' past the Three Peaks mountains of the Yorkshire Dales national park. Burn Moor (Explorer 41) can be reached by two roads and a right of way before linking up with vast tracts of upland which, the Ramblers Association says, 'provide magnificent, if challenging walking'. This lies near the Forest of Bowland, where rigorous gamekeeping had made access difficult </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> From the last houses in Sheffield, walkers lose themselves in the wilderness of Hallam, Derwent, Ughill, Bradfield, Broomhead, Midhope and Bamford Moors - one-time scenes of angry confrontations with shooting parties and water companies. The area (OL1) combines sweeping views with traces of industrial and social history </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sussex Downs. Newly open land links Amberley Mount along a north-facing escarpment to Chantry Hill (121). The gentle stretch of grassy hillside follows the South Downs Way between Amberley and Sullington but adds new off-path areas </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A second stretch of down creates access land between Newtimber Hill, Devil's Dyke, Edburton Hill, Truleigh Hill, Tottington Mount and Anchor Bottom (122). Some excellent walks with spectacular views </p> <p><strong>Rules of wider access</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The new right of access is only on foot and allows anyone to walk across newly open land 'for the purposes of open recreation' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Unless existing rights permit it, you are not allowed to take any animal other than a dog, nor to light a fire </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Killing, injuring or disturbing any animal, bird or fish is forbidden. So is damaging birds' nests and eggs </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Feeding of livestock is not allowed, nor is bathing (in non-tidal water), using a metal detector, damaging or removing plants, interfering with drains or sluices and failing to leave gates as you found them </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The law also carries provisions against 'intimidating anyone else engaged in lawful activity', which is designed to prevent confrontations between walkers and shooting parties. The Moorland Association's new visitors' code also asks walkers to 'respect shooting party requests as they will only be short-term' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Camping, organised games and paragliding are banned </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Walkers can find out details of most access land from maps produced by the Ordnance Survey, although not all maps are ready yet. Open access does not begin in some areas until next year </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Control of dogs and other responsible behaviour is governed by the Countryside Code and the Moorland Visitors' Code which emphasise safety, fire prevention, plant and animal protection </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Those interested in the development of open access may attend or apply to join new local forums, made up of landowners, users and other interested parties.

  "<p>It is six years since Fernando Hierro strode on to the turf at Camp Nou, his Real Madrid team-mates glancing nervously up at the stands as the vitriol rained down. Their coach had been stoned on its arrival in Barcelona, the players showered with broken glass, to leave the visitors shrinking in the spiteful din. </p> <p>Yet inspiration is what Hierro does best. The captain, the very personification of Madridismo, reached the centre-circle as if dragging his players reluctantly behind him before gladiatorially raising his arm to salute the stadium in the cacophony of abuse. As a gesture of defiance it infuriated the Catalans, apoplectic in their inability to break this man, but those in white were roused. </p> <p>Surroundings have changed since, but the Spaniard has not. \"If you are united as a team, you can stop any opponent,\" said Hierro. \"Those 14 years I spent at the biggest club in the world left their mark on me, but they are worth nothing now. They are in the past.\" The present is Bolton, the reality a daunting trip to Arsenal today. Confronted by the Premiership's own brand of untouchables, undefeated in 45 league games, Wanderers will need Hierro's belligerence. </p> <p>Back in Castille it still seems implausible that el jefe (the Boss) now wears the white of a team whose last major honour was earned 46 years ago. This after all is Hierro, a three-times European Cup winner whose plunder at Real also included five league titles, two intercontinental cups and a European Super Cup. That he has been lured to the Reebok speaks volumes for Bolton's progress under Sam Allardyce and, though the 36-year-old's influence to date may have been felt most keenly off the pitch, his presence on it will always be reassuring. </p> <p>Had his divorce from Real not been quite so sudden, the captain finding the escalation in the commercialism of the club distasteful, he might have been a Wanderer a year earlier. \"Bolton expressed an interest last summer but I still had issues to sort out at Real and it would have been a bit rushed if I'd pursued that move,\" said Spain's record goalscorer, his 29 goals in 89 caps all the more remarkable given that they were pilfered largely from central defence. \"The year I spent at Al-Rayyan in Qatar instead allowed me to escape the pressure cooker of Madrid, but it certainly didn't take the edge off my game. </p> <p>\"There were other offers this summer, from Mexico, Spain and the United States, but I came to Bolton with a real desire to do well and help the club on and off the field. I've wanted to come to England since I played at Wembley at Euro 96. I saw what football means in this country during that competition. It was my decision to come here and I'm proud of that. The other chapters are closed. </p> <p>\"Of course Real never leaves you. Football-wise I was born at Valladolid but I came of age at Madrid. I spent 14 years at the biggest club in the world, but they're over now. Leaving the club was a huge decision, and I was offered another year, but I decided it was the right time to leave. We had different views on how the game should be run and England is one of the last enclaves of football where it's not all driven by marketing. It's real. That appealed to me. Football's about kicking a ball on a field. Nothing else. Too much marketing and merchandising can take your eye off the ball.\" </p> <p>His claim that commercialism has yet to suffocate the Premiership was startling given that he was sitting in the plush boardroom of the Reebok Stadium - would Hierro have ever considered moving to Burnden Park? - though his arrival reflects a mellowing in the Spanish perception of English football. At Highbury this afternoon the veteran could come directly up against his compatriot, the tearaway Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, one of 12 Spaniards in the top flight, among them his Bolton team-mate Ivan Campo, also a colleague at Real. Those ranks have swelled by seven this summer. </p> <p>\"Until recently Spanish footballers would never have considered playing abroad,\" said Hierro. \"We watched Rafael Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez, Gaizka Mendieta, Pep Guardiola and Ivan de la Pe\u00f1a go to Italy and return with their tails between their legs. But look at Reyes. He's 21. Five years ago it would have been unthinkable that a player of his age would leave La Liga. No one would have dared, but his performances since going to Arsenal have proved that it was the right move. He's the future of Spanish football, he's playing in England, and that says a lot about Arsenal. </p> <p>\"They're a great club who want to give young players a chance to succeed. The way they approach the game is the right way - to bring youngsters in like Jos\u00e9 and Cesc Fabregas and develop your club. Real buy established players, Arsenal buy youth. They will attract other young Spaniards because Jos\u00e9 and Cesc are proving that Spanish players can do well here and English fans have accepted them. </p> <p>\"That's a project Arsenal are close to completing. They are a great side and, like Manchester United and Chelsea, will not be found technically wanting in Europe. Arsenal could go all the way. The fact they got so close last season will help them in terms of experience. At Madrid, between the sixth and the seventh European Cups, we waited 32 years. For all that time we were learning. Arsenal are doing that now.\" </p> <p>Few boast Hierro's experience. The sight of Allardyce consulting the Spaniard as Bolton edged closer towards a 1-0 home win over Liverpool last month was indicative of the esteem in which he is held, even if the manager will use him largely from the bench over his one-year contract. The veteran will find that hard to accept, though he will wait for his chance in a side which has maintained the momentum generated last season. His refusal to recall his heady days at Real is maintained in the dressing room; if he can impart advice he will, but this is a man who lives in the present, not his glorious past. </p> <p>\"It is uncomfortable sitting on the bench, but I won't knock on the manager's door to remind him what I've achieved in my career,\" he added. \"When I leave Bolton, I want them to remember me as a model professional. For the moment, this is all new. One of the reasons I came to England was to experience life under a manager who runs the club from top to bottom. I don't know how Sam does it. He's got the strength to deal with the coaching, the team, but also the signings and sales off the pitch. If there's no tea in the dressing room, it'll be Sam who gets it sorted. </p> <p>\"I'd like to help as much as I can here at Bolton. I've gained a lot from football. At some stage I want to give something back. But now it's about ending Arsenal's run. We can't worry too much about them - we have to concentrate on our own qualities, not fret about the opposition's strengths. We must impose ourselves upon them.\" Arsenal's slick approach may be as intimidating as the atmosphere at Camp Nou six years ago, but the Spaniard will greet it with the same strong-arm defiance.</p>",
  "<p>After a 1970s row over sex and/or swearing in a TV play, the dramatist Trevor Griffiths said it was no accident that broadcasting chose the title \"controller\" for its bosses rather than the \"editor\" of newspapers or \"director\" of theatre and film. TV, he suggested, was a medium obsessed with manipulating content and reaction.</p> <p>But his words came back to me on Wednesday evening as I flicked between all eight European Champions League matches. Calling the shots from the sofa - in a way previously restricted to specialist vision-mixers in the studio - has been the TV experience of this summer.</p> <p>For the first time, the BBC's Wimbledon and Olympic coverage allowed digital and satellite viewers to watch full matches and events which would once have been reduced to a one-line summary from the presenter of the controller's scheduled coverage on the main channel.</p> <p>Because our present is so routinely futuristic, we have become casual about technological advance. But, sampling eight football games simultaneously on Wednesday night, it struck me that this is as significant a shift in the consumption of television as the arrival of colour, video-recording or satellite.</p> <p>When I was at school, whole hours on the playground were devoted to predictions of which game they would show on television that Saturday: transmission details were censored because of fears of reducing attendance. Later, when the games were freely advertised, there was the bleat about the same four teams always being screened. So choosing between all the available games in a competition feels, to adapt Philip Larkin on 1960s sex, like \"paradise/Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives\".</p> <p>We can see in this summer's sports coverage the likely shape of all future viewing: planning a night's entertainment from numbered lists of programmes on the web rather than newspaper grids.</p> <p>This isn't the total defeat of the Griffiths theory. Writers in television are probably more controlled than ever before, with escalating layers of competing executives standing between a script and its transmission. But viewers are increasingly being offered at least the illusion of self-control, self-scheduling.</p> <p>But, as the Larkin poem reflects, apparent paradise tends to reveal catches when the light changes. This democracy of watching comes at a cost. My eight-game experience this week was only possible because of paying Sky Sports an annual sum that makes the BBC licence fee look like a book of stamps. And the tennis and athletics options on the BBC this summer were only available to those who had paid at least the cost of a digital box.</p> <p>The level of self-control achieved is also obviously relative. What Trevor Griffiths failed to acknowledge in his analysis is that the medium's superintendent tendency was not entirely the result of the personalities and politics of the men who ran the networks.</p> <p>Always more regulated than the press - by law and by the perception that a greater responsiblity rests on a medium which is beamed into people's homes - TV is to some extent required to control: morally, editorially. So, while interactivity will allow the viewer to opt out of the freestyle Olympic swimming chosen to lead BBC2 in favour of the small-bore shooting, it is unlikely that we will ever get to call the angles on a war or an anti-hunting demonstration or choose which depravity to watch in a play set at an orgy.</p> <p>Some digital news channels already allow us to choose heavy or light headlines in the bulletin: drop the euro, go with the dead donkey. And this raises the biggest risk of interactive viewing: that self-control encourages us to drop our standards.</p> <p>As anyone who has tried to buy a child an ice-cream is aware, choice can encourage greed and confusion. The mere knowledge that seven other games were available on Wednesday encouraged me to sample flash-points from all of them rather than appreciate one match properly. If this continues, I will end up knowing a lot less about a lot more football.</p> <p>Though acceptable for sport, the same approach applied to news and factual TV will inevitably lead to serious programmes being ignored or marginalised. The traditional British approach to TV journalism - insisting that every network has a bulletin that should not clash with that of its rivals - was designed to make it hard for a viewer to avoid the news of the day.</p> <p>This trick can be dismissed as paternalistic, but the spread of red-button television makes it easier for an individual to turn their experience of television into a river of trivia. The opening up of broadcasting to the audience may encourage shallow viewing. But eight televised games still feels a kind of paradise.</p>",
  "<p>I live a hermit-like existence among the Northern fells, confined most of the daylight hours to a monkish cell making up nonsense and scouring the internet in the vain hope of discovering that somebody has named a species of predatory ant after Juan Antonio Samaranch. </p> <p>My only contact with the outside world comes during my periodic forays to the coal shed when I am halloo-ed by the passing huntsman and his croaking pack. </p> <p>(Observing the way the tide was running on the legislation against hunting with dogs, the hunt in these parts long ago sold off its hounds and bought frogs instead. They chase smaller prey, of course, but nevertheless it has been a spectacular success. There can be no more stirring sight to the Northumbrian than that of red-coated riders and green-backed salientians galloping and hopping o'er moor and dale beneath a full moon on the scent of an oak eggar or hawkmoth, accompanied by the tooting of the horn and the occasional rubbery squelch as a laggard is caught beneath a thundering hoof. </p> <p>Some readers may say it is cruel but rest assured, if you had seen with your own eyes, as I have, the havoc a single moth can wreak when it gets among a flock of tweed sports jackets, you would not feel quite so protective towards them. Hunting with frogs is the only sane way to keep the numbers of moths down, as anyone who has sent a gamekeeper in to rid the wardrobe of the voracious blighters using a 12-bore will testify.) </p> <p>As a result of my isolation I am totally reliant on the mass media for information about modern Britain, poring over newspapers as the classicist might the histories of Polybius. Gore Vidal once observed that the surest sign of what a society considers normal is to be found not in what its citizens comment upon but on what they do not comment upon. If Gore is correct (and when was he ever wrong?), then the reaction to the sending-off of Everton's Tim Cahill on Saturday for pulling his shirt over his head provides an intriguing glimpse into a singular world. </p> <p>The view from this outsider is that the referee Steve Bennett did the right thing. All parents recognise the signs of a little one getting past himself with excitement and running round, shirt over head, yelling your brains out is plainly one of them. Bath, bed and lights out after one Thomas the Tank Engine story (\"And, if you keep interrupting me by fidgeting and asking questions, I'll stop straight away\") was what young Cahill desperately needed. </p> <p>A few moments more and all that joy would surely have ended with him lying on the floor screaming and kicking because David James would not let him try on his gloves while David Moyes stared angrily at his assistant Alan Irvine and hissed: \"Did you give him a fizzy drink?\" </p> <p>My opinion, however, was not shared by many observers. Ludicrous and draconian was the majority view of the red card. \"The game's going mad,\" summed up Kevin Keegan who knows more than most about the subject. Since nobody questioned why a fully grown man should want to run around in public with his shirt over his head I must conclude that it is perfectly commonplace in Britain for working folk to celebrate the completion of a professional task in some such exuberant manner. </p> <p>What a splendid cavalcade of entertainment this must provide. I imagine that after you bought this newspaper and the newsagent handed you back the correct change he performed a series of pelvic-thrusting motions at the counter-top while pulling a face in which ecstasy and triumph intertwined, and that the traffic warden after correctly placing a ticket beneath the windscreen wiper of your car struts towards passers-by ostentatiously kissing the badge on her uniform, while down the street a refuse collector dances the lambada with the nearest lamp-post after safely manoeuvring a wheelie bin through a treacherous belt of potholes. </p> <p>Nobody would argue that these carefully considered explosions of spontaneous joy are not a delightful civic adornment but you have to wonder where it may end. </p> <p>On the opening day of the Spanish season, for example, Espanyol's midfielder Ivan de la Pena was sent off by the referee Antonio Rubinos Perez for \"arguing and touching his testicles\". This is not the first time this sort of thing has happened in Spain either. A decade ago Real Madrid lost Hugo Sanchez to suspension after the Mexican striker was found guilty of \"clutching his genitals in a provocative fashion\". </p> <p>Sanchez (a fully qualified dentist - sorry, but I feel compelled to blurt that out whenever I mention him) had no sooner got back into the team than his colleague Michel was hauled before a disciplinary committee after an incident during which the Real midfielder was accused - in the charming language of the Spanish FA - of \"slyly crushing [Carlos Valderrama's] most secret intimacy\". Michel attempted to explain the whole thing away as a zany joke but ended up being fined 50,000 pesetas. </p> <p>The worry from where I am sitting is that Tim Cahill's chest may be the thin end of the wedge.</p>",
  "<p>Bernhard Langer has always been great with the driver, sharp with the irons, and once he made peace with the yips, pretty good with the putter, too. As the European Ryder Cup captain, he also has a nice touch as a director. </p> <p>It was Bernhard the Director who knew that sooner or later he would have to pair his Young Guns, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Luke Donald. It came sooner than anyone expected - in the afternoon foursomes of the first day when the Europeans had a substantial but hardly decisive toehold against the Americans. It was one thing to send out Donald in the morning four-balls in the company of the older, wiser and one-time veteran Paul McGinley. It was quite another to send him out again in the afternoon with another kid. </p> <p>It was Donald, 26, with one victory in his three years on the US PGA Tour and two on the European Tour, and Garcia, the crusty veteran, all of 24 - a kind of senior-junior partner - with nine pro victories and two Ryder Cups under his belt. </p> <p>Even Bernie the Director may not have wanted to play this one so close. Garcia and Donald went three up through the 10th and the 12th, then seemed on the verge of wilting away. Donald looked like a shaky rookie for a while, as in missing a short putt, but they pulled themselves together for a 2-up victory over Kenny Perry and Stewart Cink in a foursomes match that ended up being the final and dramatic moment on a dramatic day for Europe. </p> <p>With their win, Europe came out of the first day leading 6 1/2 - 1 1/2, and even the dream team of Tiger Woods and Phil Mick elson could not prevail against them. US captain Hal Sutton went for a quick knockout and got knocked out instead. They lost both of their matches. </p> <p>The decisive Donald-Garc\u00eda moment came at the par-3 17th. Donald, having blown a short putt back at the 14th, put his tee shot some 14 feet behind the pin. Garc\u00eda's birdie putt stopped dead short. Cink and Perry, who ended up in deep rough behind the green and got little out of the chip, conceded the putt, the hole and the match. </p> <p>The prospect of young gun pairing had been raised earlier with Garc\u00eda. \"Yeah, it would be great to play with someone like Luke, who is a friend of mine,\" Garcia said. The question also involved experience. \"I think experience is definitely important,\" Garc\u00eda said. \"You know, nowadays, everybody can play. On any given day, a good player can be anybody else all over the world.\" </p> <p>But then, there also was the question of good chemistry, as in winning combinations, such as Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood in a 5&amp;3 frolic over David Toms and Jim Furyk in the morning four-balls. \"One of the explanations might be that we both see the putts the same way, so we're helping each other read them,\" Westwood said. \"But I think that we just play good together because we get on so well.\" Donald was steady in the morning with Paul McGinley against Chris Riley and Stewart Cink. That was the only match the Americans did not win, and it was Cink's birdie against Donald's par that at the 15th that tied it and Riley's 6-footer for a par at the 18th that squared. Garc\u00eda, playing with Westwood against Toms and Furyk, won to holes with birdies, lost two with a bogey and a par, and clinched the win with a par at the 15th. Neither Don ald nor Garcia missed a beat, paired together. </p> <p>Donald holed a three footer to win the 10th for the three up lead. Garc\u00eda's approach to the 11th rolled back down into the fairway, and they bogeyed. They went back to three up on Donald's medium putt at the 12th and then things got interesting. </p> <p>Perry holed a 25-footer at the 13th, and Donald missed a 4-foot par putt for a half at the 14th, leaving the green with a hollow look. They were only 1 up and leaking oil. Then Garcia holed a 4-footer after Perry's 5-footer lipped out at the 15th, and after Donald just missed an eight footer for the win at the 16th, he got the tee shot home at the 17th to set up the win. The Kiddie Korps was home free, and Langer was breathing easier, smiling and reaching for his lineup card.</p>",
  "Russia's most wanted man, the Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev, taunted the Kremlin yesterday by claiming responsibility for the attack on the school in Beslan and saying he had personally trained the hostage-takers. <p>Mr Basayev openly mocked President Vladimir Putin, who has put a $10m (\u00a35.5m) bounty on his head, for \"screaming like a stuck pig\" about the attack, which he said was an effort to take the Chechen war back to Russia. </p> <p>Mr Putin received a further blow to his prestige yesterday when two of his Kremlin predecessors and erstwhile supporters, Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev, criticised him for endangering their hard-won democratic reforms. </p> <p>In a statement on a Chechen rebel mouthpiece website, Mr Basayev denied knowing Osama bin Laden and sought to blame the Beslan bloodbath on the Russian attempt to storm the school. </p> <p>He called for a UN investigation into the chaotic episode, and promised to cooperate. </p> <p>\"Putin screamed like a stuck pig and said that ... war was declared on Russia,\" he said. \"He wants the rest of the world's involvement with the blood spilled in Beslan and appeals for help, but he forgets that Chechnya is Russia's internal affair.\" </p> <p>News agencies reported that Mr Basayev also took credit for a bus-stop bombing, a metro bombing and the destruction by suicide bombers of two passenger aeroplanes last month. </p> <p>More than 400 people were killed in the four attacks. </p> <p>He said he had personally trained the 33 hostage-takers in the woods 12 miles from Beslan, and warned of more attacks, promising to continue the fight \"by our rules\". </p> <p>The national airline Aeroflot said yesterday that it would appoint security officers to oversee all operations after it was reported that the suicide bomber had bribed a rival airline employee to get on board one of the ill-fated flights on August 24. </p> <p>And the Moscow police defused a powerful bomb outside a busy metro station in an eastern suburb on Thursday evening. </p> <p>Mr Putin said that the country was \"engaged in serious preparations\" to act against militants. </p> <p>He fired another broadside at western critics alarmed by his move to use his own \"war on terror\" to grab more power for the Kremlin. </p> <p>\"A patronising and indulgent attitude to the murderers amounts to complicity in terror,\" he said. He compared those who called for talks with Chechen separatists to the pre-war appeasers of Hitler. </p> <p>\"Every concession leads to expanding their demands and multiplying our losses,\" he added. </p> <p>Russia has already complained to Britain about statements made in London by Akhmed Zakayev, the envoy of the Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov. Mr Zakayev won asylum last year. </p> <p>British embassy officials in Moscow said London had already frozen the British assets of Mr Basayev's group and other known Chechen terrorist organisations. </p> <p>Mr Putin's robust response to the terror threat meanwhile drew criticism from Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gorbachev, both of whom advised against plan-ned constitutional changes that will let him appoint the currently elected regional governors and remove constituency elections for half the deputies in parliament. </p> <p>\"How can you stamp out corruption without a normal parliament or free press?\" Mr Gorbachev said in the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti. </p> <p>\"Without control on the part of society? But there is no movement in this direction. The reverse is happening.\" </p> <p>Mr Yeltsin, who has avoided commenting on Mr Putin's policies since stepping down almost five years ago, was more guarded. </p> <p>\"The stifling of freedom and the curtailing of democratic rights is a victory for the terrorists,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Only a democratic country can successfully resist terrorism and count on standing shoulder to shoulder with all of the world's civilised countries,\" he said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Russian intelligence service claimed yesterday to have apprehended an Algerian recruited to the Chechen cause in a London mosque four years ago.

  "<p><strong> The In-Between World of Vikram Lall</strong><br> by MG Vassanji<br> 436pp, Canongate, \u00a314.99 <br> </p> <p> \"The [white] settlers saw it as another South Africa ... except this would be better, more like Devonshire or Surrey, with the Africans their happy servants or junior partners. And the Indians ... almost as racist as the whites - and lazy.\" Welcome to Kenya, and MG Vassanji's The In-Between World of Vikram Lall. The novel is an account not only of Kenya's colonial past, but also its post-colonial and neo-colonial present; it is about the three races whose intersection in that place and at that time shaped the present reality. </p> <p>Vikram's family forms the conduit for the story's transmission. His grandfather and other indentured labourers were \"recruited from an assortment of towns in northwest India and brought to an alien, beautiful, and wild country at the dawn of the twentieth century\". He falls in love with the beautiful country and decides to make it his home. Migrants, migration and the xenophobia that often accompanies them are strong sub-themes in the book. The narrator ponders: \"What makes a man leave the land of his birth, the home of his childhood memories ... ?\" He makes this observation in a hide-out in Canada - unlike his grandfather, the \"home of his childhood memories\" is not India but Kenya; again unlike his grandfather he did not leave his home as an economic migrant, but as a fugitive, \"one of Africa's most corrupt men\". </p> <p>Many books (Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Weep Not, Child comes to mind) have proved that any meaningful examination of Kenya's murky political present must take a step into the past, particularly to the emergency of 1952-60, also known as the Mau Mau uprising. Vassanji's narrator, Vikram Lall, describes that past as \"a colonial world of repressive, undignified subjecthood\". This is the world in which he grows up with his sister, Deepa, and their friends: the African, Njoroge, and the British, Bill and Ann. It is here that they discover love, a discovery that will haunt their later lives. It is here that Vikram gets his first political education one day when Bill, Ann and their parents are brutally murdered by the Mau Mau. </p> <p>Vikram's father, Ashok, is one of those peculiar products of the colonial period - loyal to the Queen, a member of the Asian Home Guard troops used by the British to suppress the Africans. Vikram's mother, Sheila, is a racist Punjabi housewife who just can't understand why her only daughter would fall in love with Njoroge, \"that Kikuyu\". </p> <p>Mwangi, the gentle gardener and Njoroge's grandfather, turns out to be the Mau Mau oath-giver and is killed by the British; Mahesh Uncle, Vikram's charming uncle, turns out to be a covert Mau Mau supporter and Marxist revolutionary and is later deported back to India by the new African leaders. Njoroge's idealism finally leads to his assassination. Only Vikram judges the fickle temper of the times correctly and wisely refuses to take sides: \"It was not for me to change this world. Moral judgments, therefore, I shied away from ... I therefore prefer my place in the middle, watch events run their course. This is easy, being an Asian, it is my natural place.\" </p> <p>The book is about survival, political and personal. Vikram becomes the middleman, the moneychanger, the fixer, to ensure his place and his family's in the new Kenya. The British, to ensure the survival of their legacy, installed the new leaders - men not necessarily of the best quality, but reliable because of their greed and contempt for the people - as buffers against the rising tide of Marxism/socialism that had overrun neighbouring Tanzania. Sometimes Vassanji's image of the corrupt African politician - lugging a suitcase full of cash - verges on clich\u00e9, but his use of real political figures is daring. </p> <p>Vassanji deliberately blurs the line between victim and victimiser. The new African elite suddenly begin to act more and more like their British predecessors. The Mau Mau freedom fighters who gave up everything to fight the colonialists are now hounded on the streets and arrested for the flimsiest reasons. The same colonial policemen and their African collaborators who tortured the Mau Mau and other blacks during the emergency are still in office as security advisers for the new ruling class. </p> <p> The In-Between World is a good example of how the post-colonial novel should be written, dispassionately, avoiding the easy pitfalls of nostalgia and essentialism. Vassanji writes with admirable restraint; the first part is the hardest to read - one often feels like giving the plot a kick to get it moving. But the slow pace is understandable if one considers that Vassanji, himself born in Kenya, is returning to the scenes of his childhood with all its memories. This is the work of a writer at the top of his form. My only regret is that some characters, like Njoroge and Mahesh Uncle, are under-utilised, their revolutionary possibilities not fully exploited - but of course this is not a book about revolutions. It is mostly about the futility of revolutions, and the triumph of reactionaries. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Helon Habila's Waiting for an Angel is published by Penguin</p>",
  "<p>A few days after her mother died, my wife brought home 12 bin bags and some cardboard boxes full of things. I helped her carry them up from the car and the remnants of Margaret's life - books, papers, clothes - have been sitting in a corner of our hall ever since. That afternoon, I withdrew to our garden shed, a favourite refuge of mine, to think. </p> <p>A day later, I found myself at Tate Modern in London, in a room full of fragments of charred wood and twisted metal: Cornelia Parker's Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View . Both installation and sculpture, Cold Dark Matter is the remains of a garden shed (and its contents) which has been blown to pieces. Thousands of fragments are suspended from the ceiling by invisible threads, frozen in space, a constellation of objects including burnt books, garden tools, a bicycle wheel and an ice skate. A single light bulb at their centre casts strange shadows on the walls. The visual impact of Cold Dark Matter is immediate but its meaning unfolds more gradually. </p> <p>Entering the darkened gallery space you see the shadows and the shape of the sculpture first, a perfect cube about 10ft wide, hovering just above the floor. You are then pulled closer by the objects, slowly recognising them: a hairbrush, a hubcap, a child's tricycle, all of them burnt, damaged, useless. You are looking at the aftermath of an explosion. The artist gathered the objects from various sources, placed them in a garden shed and then, with the help of the British Army, blew the whole lot up. </p> <p>Parker likes doing violent things to her materials: she has shot, crushed and stretched objects before. Yet what is surprising about this piece is not its energy or movement but its peace and tranquillity. The white heat of the explosion exists now as a memory, like the original big bang alluded to in the title. The splintered debris from one second in time is frozen in space in a perfect cube. The heat and violence are history, seen now as a warped and tarnished silver plate, the singed pages of a picture book or a charred splinter of wood. Each immobile fragment once had its own story, once belonged to someone's life. The fragility of Cold Dark Matter, the delicate shards of blackened wood suspended in space, the emptiness at its centre, confronts us with our own mortality. </p> <p>How long do you need to keep a dead person's belongings? What do you keep and what do you throw away? These questions seem central to Parker's work, yet I can imagine my irreverent mother-in-law laughing at this over-interpretation of a shed full of junk. Surely part of the point of this piece is to blow apart intellectual posturing about art. There is a jokey, junk-shop aesthetic to this work (a humour which runs through most of Parker's art) that links it back to Marcel Duchamp. (His Fountain, a ready-made urinal in fact sits in an adjacent gallery, a testimony to the cataclysmic changes in art of the 20th century.) </p> <p>After Duchamp, artists only needed to think of something, to go to a shop and buy it. Andr\u00e9 Breton, the founder of Surrealism, scoured the flea markets of Paris for bits of junk, while Parker sought out the objects for Cold Dark Matter from car boot sales. Parker is just one of many contemporary artists who have ceased to \"make\" new things. She is part of the generation of young British artists, \"yBas\", who were celebrated for the shot of radical energy they brought to British art in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Yet behind the facade of newness, assumed to be inherent to their youth, there is not only a reluctance to look forward but also an urge to destroy. In part, it is an adherence to Dada and Surrealist ideology, a continuation of the ready-made tradition of Duchamp, in part a response to the relentless consumerism of the west. The artist has lost faith in production. She no longer creates; she collects, co-ordinates, configures. </p> <p>British artist Michael Landy followed Parker's destructive impulse to its logical conclusion. For Break Down he created an inventory of everything he owned, a list of over 7,000 objects, and then ground every one of them to dust. This extraordinary event took place in a disused department store in Oxford Street among thousands of shoppers, stressing the ever closer relation of art and commerce. </p> <p>There is a paradox confronting every artist: the need to preserve the past as well as destroy it; the need to give, as Parker does, new life to old materials. Hanging high within Cold Dark Matter is a book which suggests she has thought long and hard on these issues - its title is just visible: The Artist's Dilemma. </p> <p>Also among the carefully chosen objects in Parker's shed are a number related to childhood: toys, a picture book, a tricycle. Nostalgia is inherent to Parker's work; the objects you look at have a history, were once something else. In another work, Breathless , Parker collected the instruments of a brass band, crushed them completely flat and suspended them like the objects in Cold Dark Matter. Here the melancholy longing for the past is even more palpable, not least because the piece hangs in the Victoria and Albert Museum. </p> <p>Monuments and relics litter the yBa landscape: Damien's Hirst's shark, Tracy Emin's bed, Rachel Whiteread's house. Hirst's pickled animals function as trophies, pointing back to their life before being immobilised in a glass box. Away From the Flock , his perfectly preserved spring lamb, also elicits a very English vision of green rolling hills. With Tracy Emin, it is her bitter memories of her Margate childhood and adolescence that are evoked. Everyone I Have Ever Slept With was a tent in which the names of lovers, friends and family were embroidered, part diary, part monument. The now notori ous installation, My Bed is accompanied by used condoms, used tampons, empty vodka bottles. The objects, like the filthy, crumpled sheets, have no future except as museum relics. A Polaroid photograph of the artist gathers dust on the bedside table as if to emphasise this fact. The face is smiling and healthy, documenting happier times before those evidenced by the bed. No part of the artist's personal history is too small or too large to escape transfer to the art gallery; Emin has kept the cigarette packet her uncle was holding when he died in a car crash. </p> <p>In an extraordinary accident, which connects with Cold Dark Matter, the shed and the tent met a violent end, consumed by the recent fire in a London warehouse. Years earlier, the destruction, this time intentional, of another yBa icon took place not far away in a park in Bow. Rachel Whiteread's House was a concrete cast of a demolished house. For a few weeks in 1993 it stood as a sad reminder of an anonymous family's terraced home, before the demolition men moved in. </p> <p>Parker has lived in a condemned house, a dwelling due for destruction to make way for a motorway. The shed is somehow a surrogate home, a movable structure that paradoxically becomes permanent at the bottom of the garden. More fragile than a house, it nevertheless functions - like the beach hut or the womb-like space of the tent - as a refuge from the world or as a repository for things we cannot quite deal with. </p> <p>A few months after Margaret's death we scattered her ashes over a Cornish cliff. I remember watching the grey powder drift in the wind for a second and then disappear, leaving sea, sky and space. We will sort through her belongings one day soon. For the moment we are keeping them in the shed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Winner Sumantro Ghose, 39,lives in London.

  "<p>The Hamilton Case, by Michelle de Kretser (Vintage, \u00a36.99) </p> <p> Ridiculed at school and starved of his mother's affection, Sam Obeysekere grows up to be a public prosecutor in 1930s Ceylon. All he wants is justice, and his rightful place in the upper echelons of society. Solving the Hamilton case - the murder of a rich British planter - is both his moment of glory and his realisation that what he wants will always elude him. His self-aggrandising memoir forms part of Michelle de Kretser's second novel, a postmodern mix of historical murder mystery, family saga and self-referential literary work. The lush, multilayered narrative oozes with the \"routine reek of damp and rot, the bass note of the tropics\" and reveals the mouldy core at the heart of Ceylon during British colonial rule. De Kretser, a Sri Lankan by birth, is fabulously evocative of place. She weaves an exotic, if mannered, tale of pompous men, sensual women and misfit children. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> My Name is Light, by Elsa Osorio, translated by Catherine Jagoe (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> During Argentina's \"dirty war\" of the 1970s, 30,000 people were \"disappeared\" - tortured and killed - for opposing the far-right military junta. Among them were hundreds of pregnant women, many of whose babies were born and died in prison. Luz is one of those babies, but while her mother is shot and her father exiled, she is adopted by a wealthy couple who conceal her origins. As Luz matures, she feels ever more ill at ease with her family - especially her grandfather, a former general - until her conviction that she is not \"one of them\" becomes a certainty. The birth of her own child awakens memories of the traumatic first weeks of her life, and sets her off on a quest for her true identity. Argentinian writer Elsa Osoriotells the story in the voices of, among others, Luz, her adoptive father and the prostitute who befriended her mother. Weaving past and present, the novel is as much an emotional family drama as a damning account of a dark moment in history. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Internationals, by Sarah May (Vintage, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> An international is \"someone who loses his home through choice, and whose experience is meant to be valid to those who have lost their homes, or worse, against their will\". This is the pep talk a journalist, on his latest posting to the former Yugoslavia, gives to a former estate agent hoping to do some good. They are just two of the many whose lives converge near a refugee camp during the 1999 Kosovo crisis. Sarah May's third novel features tireless aid workers, decadent diplomats, corrupt officials and dispossessed locals. Pieced together, their stories make up a collage of the weeks from the start of Nato air strikes to the withdrawal of Serb forces. May is good on reportage, short on analysis. Her narrative skims the surface, and the generous sprinkling of characters hampers engagement with any in particular. As one of her own characters says, better to tell the story of one girl rescued from her smoking home than to try to process the bigger picture until it is easily digestible. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Fountain at the Centre of the World, by Robert Newman (Verso, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> Globalisation is the subject of Robert Newman's ambitious, accomplished third novel, so it's fitting that his characters are connected by world-spanning chains of cause and effect. Evan is a high-powered, amoral PR executive with a terminal illness, Chano is a disillusioned Mexican activist who has lost his wife and son to state brutality, and Daniel is a fatherless boy on a Costa Rican fishing boat. All their lives are entangled in a complex story rich in coincidence and detail. There's no doubt that the anti-globalisation argument is what matters here, but the novel avoids drowning in polemic. Instead, something dramatic and terrible happens every few pages - Newman makes the politics personal, bringing home the humiliations and alienations that power imposes on the powerless and writing about the 1999 \"battle of Seattle\" with invigorating anger, excitement and hope. <strong> ST</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Diary, by Chuck Palahniuk (Vintage, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> Poor Misty. Once she was a penniless but promising art student, then she married blue-blooded, old-moneyed Peter Wilmot, who took her away to exclusive Waytansea Island. Now the money has gone, she's a downtrodden hotel maid with a drink problem, Peter is comatose after a botched suicide attempt, and angry islanders are complaining that rooms are missing from their houses. Peter has been walling them off after decorating their interiors with hateful graffiti - and things have barely even begun to get weird. The townspeople have a plan for Misty that sends Diary spiralling out of the realm of mundane despair and into that of crazed American gothic. Palahniuk's prose is heavily mannered, but rather than becoming annoying, this drags us all the more effectively into his world. There are distinct traces of Rosemary's Baby here, but Palahniuk's unblinking eye for the strange makes this poisonous fable original as well as horrifying. <strong> ST</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Moon, by Jeremy Gavron (Scribner, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> First published in 1996, this nostalgic picture of a childhood in 1950s Africa remains fresh and involving. The unnamed narrator, looking back from lonely middle age in England, tells the story of growing up as a white boy on a Kenyan farm, and of his relationship with Ernest, a young black mechanic unusual enough to befriend him: Ernest \"who failed properly to understand the rules, who talked too much\". There is much affection for the lost experiences of this life - the isolated farmstead, shooting a leopard, going to the pictures in Nairobi, English-style boarding-school - but there is also a penetrating account of the colonial tensions riddling the country, and of the ensuing \"trouble\" that engulfs it with atrocious consequences for both Ernest and the narrator's family. Gavron writes with unshowy craftsmanship and deftly unfolds an atmospheric story, thanks to his skill at evoking the impressions of a child seeing more than he understands. ST</p>",
  "It was, perhaps, an unwise thing to say to the great and good of the Spanish language, but when the Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez suggested spelling ought to be scrapped, he did not expect to become a pariah. <p>The greatest living author in Spanish has been barred from the International Congress of the Spanish Language, a meeting organised every four years by national academies of the Spanish-speaking countries.</p> <p>Magdalena Faillace, Argentina's secretary of state for culture, who is hosting the meeting, said the author of One Hundred Years Of Solitude was excluded because he had \"made trouble\" at the same conference eight years ago.</p> <p>\"Spelling, that terror visited on human beings from the cradle onwards, should be pensioned off,\" Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez told that meeting, held in Zacatecas, Mexico.</p> <p>News that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez had been vetoed provoked Jos\u00e9 Saramago, the Portuguese Nobel prize winner, to say he would send his invitation back to the organisers. </p> <p>Ms Faillace told Spain's El Pais newspaper that it was the academies of language which had insisted the Colombian Nobel winner be banned.</p> <p>News of his exclusion, and of Mr Saramago's refusal to go, provoked a flurry of phone calls this week. At one point Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was invited but declined, claiming he did not like to speak in public.</p> <p>The head of Spain's royal academy of language, the \"mother\" of all the other acadamies, denied they vetoed Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's presence.</p> <p>Mr Saramago, meanwhile, has finally agreed to go but he is still demanding to know whose idea it was to veto his fellow Nobel prizewinner.</p> <p>\"The Argentine academy must tell us if it is true that he was not invited because of his 'trouble-making' at Zacatecas,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They mustn't think that we are stupid.\"</p> <p>Next months Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is to publish his first novel in a decade, Memories of My Sad Prostitutes, according to El Pais.</p> <p>A million copies of the book are to be distributed in Spanish-speaking countries.</p>",
  "The far-right BNP won its first council seat in London for more than a decade yesterday in a byelection marred by allegations of dirty tricks. <p>It beat Labour into second place by 470 votes in the Goresbrook ward of Barking and Dagenham, east London. </p> <p>Its candidate, Daniel Kelley, received 1,072 votes to Labour's 602. The Conservatives polled 111 votes, the Liberals Democrats 85, Ukip 137 and the Greens 59. </p> <p>The BNP had identified the seat, in a largely white working class area, as its most winnable prospect in the country and sent up to 40 activists to the area during the campaign. </p> <p>Nick Griffin, the party leader, joined campaigners at the weekend and is believed to have been in east London when the result was announced. </p> <p>The party hopes to benefit from a domino effect when it fights two more London byelections in the next few weeks. </p> <p>The election was the first test of public opinion about the BNP since racists in the party were exposed by a BBC documentary. </p> <p>But the election was clouded by the controversy about the methods the party was alleged to have used to drum up support. </p> <p>It is understood that party canvassers showed potential supporters a leaflet produced by the local healthcare trust and told them it proved that Somalis were being given priority. The leaflet is printed in Somali and none of those being canvassed would have been able to read it for themselves. </p> <p>A similar leaflet in English merely describes the services available from the refugee support team. </p> <p>Another leaflet alleged to have been used by the party suggested that other borough councils had been given carte blanche to send more people from ethnic minorities to Barking. </p> <p>Len Duvall, chairman of the London Labour party, said: \"This is a serious loss and we cannot be complacent about it. We need to ... work harder to explain to people what the BNP really stands for. </p> <p>\"I don't believe that many of the people who voted for them really understand what they are about.\" </p> <p>He said there was a sharp fall in the votes won by the Tories and Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>John Biggs, the local London assembly member, said: \"That the BNP can win a council seat is a disaster for decent people in Barking and Dagenham. It will give people outside a negative impression damaging the reputation of the area.\" </p> <p>Charles Fairbrass, the council leader, said: \"They put out leaflets that were not true. They have stirred up racial fears, but we don't have racial problems here.\" </p> <p>The last BNP seat in London was won by Derek Beackon in Millwall in 1993, but was lost eight months later.</p>"
