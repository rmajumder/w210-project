  "We should take seriously the growing number of reports that anti-terrorist measures fall disproportionately on members of our Muslim community. It is easy to understand how, in the wake of the Bigley affair, the Russian school massacre, and even the invasion of our own House of Commons, the niceties of liberal procedures are seen as obstacles to the \"war\" on terror. <p>It is, sadly, true that nowadays no society - democratic or repressive - is immune from increasingly inventive forms of deadly assault. But it is not true that liberal societies are helpless in the face of terrorist attacks. Our Human Rights Act permits the limitation of a number of its designated liberties when national security demands it. However, the difference between us and authoritarian countries is that our anti-terrorist measures must be proportionate to the danger posed and should not undermine the essence of democratic practice. </p> <p>The precise extent of any limitation on our procedural safeguards is always difficult to establish. But democracies should not allow potentially innocent people to be held for long periods without a trial, or to be humiliated or damaged by torture. Once a democratic country closes down free expression, or begins to discriminate against certain minorities, the bright distinction between its values and those of authoritarian regimes will soon dim. As a US supreme court justice, John Paul Stevens, said in a recent case about conditions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay: \"We must not wield the tools of tyranny even to resist the forces of tyranny.\" </p> <p>The feature that distinguishes Britain and other democracies most clearly from tyrannical states is the independence of the judiciary, which should not lightly be challenged. David Blunkett has frequently berated judges who have held against his department. And he recently threatened to exclude any judicial review in asylum cases. Similarly, when Michael Howard was home secretary, he challenged the judiciary and is now leading the Conservatives in an attack upon an alleged surfeit of claims under the Human Rights Act and what he calls the \"compensation culture\". More subtly, both sides of the political spectrum are seeking to downplay rights in favour of so-called public duties. </p> <p>Both Blunkett and Howard are wrong. For a start, human rights litigation is not multiplying exponentially. Do not believe the anecdote about the burglar who successfully sued the owner of a home he ransacked after falling through a defective skylight. It is true that, prior to the introduction of the Human Rights Act, the committee set up to anticipate its impact on court business believed it was likely to stimulate a \"flood\" of new cases. But nothing of that scale has taken place. Nor has the dire prediction that the act would serve as a \"villain's charter\" remotely been fulfilled. </p> <p>It is certainly the case that judges have, over the years, limited the unfettered rights of ministers. Until recently, when parliament conferred discretion upon a minister in broad terms (to act \"in the public interest\" or \"as he sees fit\"), his actions were virtually immune from judicial challenge. Nowadays, our courts require public officials to have greater respect for the people they serve - for example, by providing a fair hearing before limiting rights or interests. Even so, the judges have been remarkably restrained about interfering with the substance of discretionary decisions by ministers. So we should welcome the judicial development of principles of good public administration and accountability. </p> <p>The argument for duties rather than rights is another red herring. Of course we should encourage a notion of civic duty in a general sense. But civic virtues cannot easily be legislated. The old Soviet constitutions used to impose a catalogue of vague obligations upon citizens (such as the duty to go to the aid of anyone in distress). Because they were not enforceable, they diminished respect for the constitutions. In any event, our most important duties are to respect the rights of others. </p> <p>Instead of belittling rights and judges, Blunkett and Howard could take a leaf out of Nelson Mandela's book. Shortly after he became president, one of his decisions was struck down by South Africa's new constitutional court. He immediately welcomed the judgment, saying it established from the outset that in the new South Africa no one was above the law, and that the judges were the final arbiters of the constitution. </p> <p>In the heat of the vital battle against new and fearsome forms of attack, it is tempting to tolerate an erosion of equality and liberty. However, these principles are hard-won cornerstones of our democracy, which must also be heavily defended against the terrorist threat. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jeffrey Jowell QC is professor of public law at University College London, and a vice-president of the Council of Europe's Commission for Democracy Through Law </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.jowell@ucl.ac.uk\">j.jowell@ucl.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "Under a nearly full moon, rebel fighters leapt on to the sand from the back of their battle-wagon; a Toyota pick-up truck with a machine gun on its cab and an anti-tank missile launcher slung from the wing mirror. The moonlight picked out every rock, bush and dune for miles, but these men had no fear of being seen or heard. <p>This region of north-western Darfur is controlled by the Sudan Liberation Army, the rebel movement which prompted the Sudanese government to unleash the Janjaweed militia. </p> <p>A ceasefire was agreed in April, but it has been repeatedly violated by both sides; on Sunday, two policemen were shot dead in a rebel attack on a police post in south Darfur. Peace talks in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, collapsed a fortnight ago over a rebel demand that the Janjaweed disarm before they do. </p> <p>In the SLA's camps, there is no talk of peace. Young men from Darfur's shattered villages have come to find an outlet for their rage. </p> <p>Khalid, who wore a camouflage vest and a long knife at his waist, said: \"I am very angry because my father was killed, and one of my brothers, and my uncle. In the refugee camps, I have no work to do. I want to fight.\" He claimed to be 15 but looked younger. Rebel officers have refused to let him join up because they say he is too young, but he will not go to live with his mother who is in a refugee camp in Chad. Instead, he helps fetch firewood and carry water for the fighters. </p> <p>The war in Darfur began last April, when the SLA raided the town of El Fashir, the capital of north Darfur, where fighters captured some military officers and destroyed a number of warplanes. </p> <p>In retaliation, the regime in Khartoum armed the traditional militias of the Arab tribes in Darfur, which have come to be known as the Janjaweed, and gave them air support to attack the villages from which the rebels drew their backing. A million people have been driven from their homes and nearly 200,000 more have fled across into Chad. But the rebels have not been defeated. Instead, they have found fresh recruits as a result of the government's onslaught. </p> <p>One such recruit is Ismail, 22, a tall man in a grey tunic who joined after the Janjaweed killed his family last July. </p> <p>\"At the time I didn't know who the SLA were,\" he said at a rebel camp in Darfur. \"After they killed my father and mother, and my two brothers, I heard that there were people who were fighting against the government. I kept asking for them until I arrived at a [rebel] camp. Now I'm fighting the Janjaweed.\" He was a cowherd before the war. Now he carries an American-made automatic rifle and an ammunition belt with cotton pouches tied around his chest. Looped beneath the belt are strings of leather pouches holding lucky charms. Each talisman protects against a different menace: scorpions, snakes and bullets. </p> <p>The rebellion is well-equipped. There are Kalashnikovs, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, anti-tank missiles and Belgian-made automatic rifles. </p> <p>The rebels say all their weapons are looted from the Sudanese military, but they admit buying camouflage uniforms on the black market from Chadian soldiers. This may also be a route for weapons. </p> <p>The backs of their pick-ups are loaded with drums of petrol and there are several boxes which they describe as \"medicines\", but from their weight appear to be ammunition. </p> <p>Rebel officers call each other on satellite phones, paying with phonecards sent from fundraising offices in Europe and the Gulf. Some funds come from expatriate Darfuri communities but the war also sustains itself through looting. </p> <p>The SLA's strategy is to mount hit-and-run raids, striking at government convoys, checkpoints, or at towns when they have the strength. </p> <p>The aim is to disrupt supply lines, destroy the Sudanese military's equipment, and steal weapons, ammunition, cars, food and medicines for their effort. They cannot hold on to towns or villages because they cannot fight the government's air power. </p> <p>The rebels have attacked mainly military targets, but are also accused of intimidating local civilian leaders who cooperate with the government. In April a tribal leader was abducted and murdered by the SLA after accepting food aid from the government. </p> <p>The rebellion has brought ruin on the people they claim to be fighting for, but the fighters are unrepentant. </p> <p>One of their officers, Izzedine Yahya Hamid, 25, said the choice was between exile or death at the hands of a government bent on their destruction. \"If we fight then our people will become refugees. But if we do not fight, then our people will be killed by the government of [Sudanese president Omar] el-Bashir and the Janjaweed.\" </p> <p>Mr Hamid, a former medical student who spoke fluent English, sketched a map of Sudan on a sheet of paper. He marked Darfur on the map, then pointed to other zones of rebellion; the south, where a peace deal has been concluded after 21 years of civil war, the centre, where the Nuba people have clashed with the government, and the east, where the Beja people are threatening fresh strife. </p> <p>Then he drew a circle north of Khartoum to show where the Arab tribes who dominate the country originate from. </p> <p>\"We don't hope to be independent,\" he said. \"We just hope that Sudan will become a new Sudan, with the Nuba people, and the people in the south and our people all balanced. But not the Janjaweed, because they are criminals.\" </p> <p>For some, the rebellion is an adventure. Many young men in Darfur are accustomed to living a semi-nomadic lifestyle. Living in a rebel encampment is not far removed from this. </p> <p>There is laughter and camaraderie here, and a freedom they do not enjoy in the crowded refugee camps. </p> <p>But it is noticeable that among the younger fighters, there are far fewer smiles and little laughter. A generation is being reared in an atmosphere of hatred and violence. The longer the war goes on, the more brutalised its fighters will become.</p>",
  "<p>World oil prices set record highs of almost $50 a barrel yesterday as fears of disruption to Nigerian supplies spooked an already tight market and threatened to have a knock-on effect at garage forecourts. </p> <p>The highest demand for oil in 25 years means global production is stretched to the limit, so news of fresh fighting between government troops and rebels in Nigeria's oil-rich Delta pushed up prices. </p> <p>US light crude futures rose 86 cents a barrel to $49.74, breaking the previous record of $49.40 set over a month ago. Brent crude surged 87 cents to a new high of $46.25. </p> <p>World stock markets fell on concern that rising oil prices could damage the global economy. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped below 10,000. </p> <p>\"Once again the security situation in Nigeria is proving to be a real concern,\" said Simon Wardell, oil analyst at World Markets Research Centre in London. \"We expect to see prices go through $50 a barrel as a consequence of this and hurricane Ivan, as some facilities [in the Gulf of Mexico] are still damaged.\" </p> <p>Rebels announced the beginning of a new offensive across Nigeria's entire southern delta region, and oil group Shell announced it was pulling some staff out of the impoverished area as a precaution. </p> <p>Nigeria pushed output to 2.5m barrels per day (bpd) of crude but had to cut that by 10% because of the strain on its ageing oil infrastructure. </p> <p>Oil prices fell back in late August as the Opec cartel increased production, but they have jumped in the past couple of weeks on supply disruption in the Gulf of Mexico caused by hurricane Ivan. News that Iraqi output had jumped to 2.5m bpd, its highest level since before the US-led invasion last year, did little to soothe the market. Dealers know the country's oil infrastructure is subject to almost daily attacks and supply is unreliable. </p> <p>Opec pumped 30.5m bpd this month, the highest level since 1979, but with most cartel members at maximum output, only Saudi Arabia has spare capacity. Demand from China, India and the US is easily absorbing the extra output. </p> <p>Separately, Reuters reported that the IMF had raised its forecast for world economic growth this year to 5% but trimmed next year's to 4.3% due to a slightly weaker outlook for the US and Chinese economies.</p>",
  "<p>RMC, the world's biggest supplier of ready-mixed concrete, has agreed a \u00a32.3bn takeover deal from Cemex of Mexico, raising fears of job cuts and quarry closures. </p> <p>The transaction took the City by surprise and boosted shares in the British firm 42% to 850p, only 5p lower than the cash offer price. </p> <p>It also boosted the stock market value of other potential targets in the building materials sector such as Hanson. </p> <p>The Cemex transaction is the biggest launched by a Mexican company and will create a third force in global cement making, behind Lafarge of France and Holcim of Switzerland. </p> <p>Hector Medina, executive vice-president of Cemex, refused to say whether the RMC management would be retained or whether there would be wider cutbacks. \"We can't rule out anything.\" </p> <p>Cemex is aiming for savings of $200m (\u00a3110m) annually by 2007 and a review of the British firm would need to be completed before the future shape and size was decided, he said. </p> <p>No one should expect any \"Mexicanisation\" of the business because his company had a \"very multicultural management team\". </p> <p>Cemex had been following RMC for some time and opened talks with directors two weeks ago. </p> <p>Mr Medina denied Cemex was overpaying but said it was a \"fair\" price for shareholders of RMC and its new owner. Cemex would need to borrow \"just a few dollars\" to fund the $5.8bn enterprise value of the deal. </p> <p>David Munro, RMC's chief executive, said shareholders were being offered the chance to cash in on the strong potential of the business. </p> <p>\"Becoming part of a powerful new group within the global heavy building materials industry will offer great scope and opportunities for our staff.\" </p> <p>Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein urged RMC shareholders to \"take the cash and run\". </p> <p>RMC, formerly known as Ready Mixed Concrete, was started by a Danish engineer, Kjeld Ammentorp, in 1930 with \u00a36,000 seed capital. </p> <p>It has been through a rough period owing to weakness in the German economy but was seen by the City as on the mend after a substantial restructuring which saw 5,000 jobs go. </p> <p>RMC, which gains 45% of its sales of cement and other building materials in Britain and Germany, follows Blue Circle into the control of a foreign firm. Blue Circle was bought by Lafarge in 2001 for just over \u00a33bn. </p> <p>The acquisition of RMC will increase Cemex's exposure to mainland Europe and raise Cemex's profile in downstream markets. </p> <p>RMC employs 28,000 staff in 22 countries including 6,500 in Britain at 300 concrete plants and 140 quarries. It produces 12m tonnes of cement a year and in 2003 had a turnover of \u00a34.9bn. </p> <p>Cemex, which owns one of Mexico's leading football clubs, employs 25,000 people in 30 countries and produced sales of $7.2bn last year but is more than twice as profitable as RMC. </p> <p>The biggest takeover deal launched by a Mexican firm in Britain before this was a $23m bid 10 years ago for Ionica Group, a privately owned telephone network. </p> <p>The largest previous transaction by a Mexican company anywhere was the $3.6bn takeover of a Coca-Cola bottling business. </p> <p>New York-listed Cemex made waves in the 1990s with a series of domestic takeovers that transformed it into a substantial international business. Four years ago it bought US cement maker Southdown for $2.8bn.</p>",
  "So here we are facing the possibility unique in our 100 year history, of governing Britain for a third successive term. <p> </p> <p>Never done it before. Never debated it before. Never imagined it before. </p> <p> </p> <p>Progressive parties, like the Labour Party, rarely fail because of their values.</p> <p> </p> <p>Fairness, justice, solidarity, opportunity for all.</p> <p> </p> <p>These are the impulses of any decent human spirit.</p> <p> </p> <p>No. We almost always fail when we don't foresee the future in which those values must be applied.</p> <p> </p> <p>The values require steadfast conviction.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the future requires restless courage to know and act upon the coming reality however hard the challenge it holds.</p> <p> </p> <p>And when the two, conviction and courage combine their strength and take on the challenges, they beat them and in time what was a challenge, becomes part of the new consensus. </p> <p> </p> <p>Reflect on the things once the passionate subject of controversy, people no longer talk about.</p> <p> </p> <p>Remember the march for jobs.</p> <p>No-one talks of mass unemployment now. When two weeks ago it fell to its lowest level for 30 years, it passed without notice.</p> <p> </p> <p>Who did it? The British people, by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are people who a decade ago could tell you of interest rates double what they are today, of homes repossessed, of families who didn't know from one week to the next where the mortgage payments were going to come from.</p> <p> </p> <p>But who talks of boom and bust economics today? </p> <p> </p> <p>Who did it? The British people by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>And when was the last time you heard of a winter crisis in the health service or the scandal of outside toilets in primary schools, now that this country, Britain, is the only one anywhere in the developed world increasing public spending on health and education every year, year on year, as a proportion of our national income?</p> <p> </p> <p>And who did it? The British people by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>When did you last hear of pensioners freezing to death in the cold because they couldn't afford the heating?</p> <p> </p> <p>Or how great a debate is there today about the break-up of the United Kingdom, now that Scotland has its Parliament and Wales its Assembly? But twelve years ago an election was fought on it.</p> <p> </p> <p>A week ago, after the talks at Leeds Castle on Northern Ireland, an eighteen year old asked me: \"how come we never hear much about Northern Ireland\"?</p> <p> </p> <p>But we used to wake up every morning to it, didn't we?</p> <p> </p> <p>And remember when to be in favour of gay rights was to be a loony leftie, race relations was political correctness, and Red Ken frightened people even as brave as your own leadership?</p> <p> </p> <p>Now the parties compete for the gay vote, unite against the BNP and Ken has led and won the debate on congestion charging and community policing.</p> <p> </p> <p>So many things that used to divide our country bitterly, now unite it in healthy consensus.</p> <p> </p> <p>Who did it? The British people, by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>Or when the next election comes, will they say Labour can't run the economy; there'll be a run on the markets; that Labour can't defend Britain or won't support the police?</p> <p> </p> <p>No.</p> <p> </p> <p>Labour is working.</p> <p> </p> <p>Britain is working.</p> <p> </p> <p>The longest period of economic growth since records began, an economy now bigger than that of Italy and France.</p> <p> </p> <p>The lowest unemployment and highest employment rate of any of our competitors for the first time since the 1950s.</p> <p> </p> <p>Living standards up, for everyone, and for the poorest up most.</p> <p> </p> <p>The biggest reductions in child poverty and biggest increases in investment for decades.</p> <p> </p> <p>This isn't a country in decline.</p> <p> </p> <p>The British people aren't a people on the way down.</p> <p> </p> <p>We are winning. They are winning. </p> <p> </p> <p>And why did they vote for change? Because we had the courage of our convictions and we dared to change.</p> <p> </p> <p>So why is Government so tough? Because for all the progress, life's still tough for many hard-working families:</p> <p> </p> <p> if you're a young married couple trying to buy a house;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you're trying to balance home and family life;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you're worried about saving for retirement;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you're scared to walk out at night;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you, the taxpayer, see people who don't deserve it getting benefits, when you can't get the help you need and do deserve.</p> <p> </p> <p>Modern life is being perpetually stressed out. </p> <p> </p> <p>You can do more, travel more, consume more, live longer.</p> <p> </p> <p>But nothing stays still. It's always changing.</p> <p> </p> <p>And for the politicians, it's like having a conversation with people in an area where your mobile phone doesn't work properly. You know what it's like. You hear scraps of the conversation, most of it distorted and it's all intensely irritating.</p> <p> </p> <p>The public think the politicians don't know or care about their lives; and the politicians feel misunderstood.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I am an optimist about Britain; and the difference between an optimist and a pessimist is not that the optimist believes the world is wonderful and the pessimist believes it's beset by challenges; the difference is the pessimist believes we will be defeated by them; the optimist thinks the challenges can be overcome.</p> <p> </p> <p>And meanwhile think how lucky we are.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lucky to have been able to change our Party from one of permanent opposition to one that can compete for government on equal terms.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lucky to be in a country as great as this serving a people as decent as the British people.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lucky to have a Cabinet of talented men and women I'm proud to call friends as well as colleagues.</p> <p> </p> <p>I won't list them all. You know who they are. They know how much I value what they do.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I will mention the two who have been with me, in Opposition and in Government in the same jobs every step of the way. Gordon and John, the one a personal friend for twenty years and the best Chancellor this country has ever had and the other the strongest, most loyal deputy any leader could ever wish for.</p> <p> </p> <p>And we are lucky in our Opposition. </p> <p> </p> <p>I know people say we should take the Lib Dems seriously. But I can't. </p> <p> </p> <p>I like Charles incidentally.</p> <p> </p> <p>But recently he asked </p> <p> </p> <p>\"The Lib Dems are doing well but we have to answer the question: what do you stand for?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Charles, my strong advice is: don't go there.</p> <p> </p> <p>The great advantage of the Lib Dems is precisely that no-one knows what they stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>If they ever find out it'll be the end of you.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Lib Dems voted against every single measure for action against ASB;</p> <p> </p> <p>against withdrawing benefits from failed asylum seekers even when all their appeals were finished;</p> <p> </p> <p>and they believe you can get an extra \u00a330 billion in tax in one Parliament just from top-rate taxpayers, to pay for spending pledges they can't possibly afford.</p> <p> </p> <p>Meanwhile the other part of their Party wants to change our NHS for a system of compulsory private medical insurance.</p> <p> </p> <p>Believe me, Charles, leave the public in blissful ignorance.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Tories by contrast, don't need to ask what they stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>They know what they stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>Unfortunately for them, so do the British people.</p> <p> </p> <p>Two recessions, 10 per cent mortgage rates, the poll tax, 3 million unemployed, opposition to the minimum wage and crime doubled.</p> <p> </p> <p>Michael Howard did well at first because people had forgotten him. Now they've remembered.</p> <p> </p> <p>All you need to know is that when his advisers told him the Tories had to become a Party of the future, he brought back John Redwood. </p> <p> </p> <p>It is New Labour that now wears the one nation mantle.</p> <p> </p> <p>And the daftest thing said about New Labour is not the usual \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Like someone I met at the TUC who said what have you ever done for trade unionists?</p> <p> </p> <p>I said \"what about the right to union recognition?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Yeah, but apart from that?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"The first ever minimum wage\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Yeah, alright, but ....\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Or the Social Chapter, paid holidays, restoration of union rights at GCHQ, an end to blacklisting, information and consultation rights\".</p> <p> </p> <p>Then he said: \"Yeah, but no-one knows about it\".</p> <p> </p> <p>I said \"Well, try telling them.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>It's not that.</p> <p> </p> <p>Someone showed me an article recently about how:</p> <p> </p> <p> \"Tony Blair has marginalised the Tories\".</p> <p> </p> <p>I thought it's a change to read something nice. Then I realised it was a criticism.</p> <p> </p> <p>Like, after years in which people thought the Labour Party was unfit to govern, now they think the Tories are. And I should be really sorry about it.</p> <p> </p> <p>The trouble is even now, even after the lessons of 18 years of opposition followed by two terms of Government, we still think they're the Party of Government, they're the ruling class and we're not part of it. And we're not. Neither should we be.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the point is: Britain doesn't need a ruling class today.</p> <p> </p> <p>The rulers are the people.</p> <p> </p> <p>The reason the Tories are marginalised is they refuse to accept we're equals.</p> <p> </p> <p>They still think they don't need to ask any fundamental questions about today's Tory Party.</p> <p> </p> <p>They just hope that we'll buckle.</p> <p> </p> <p>Well we won't.</p> <p> </p> <p>If we have the heart to hold true to our values; and the head to understand the future in which they have to work.</p> <p> </p> <p>What have we learnt in Government?</p> <p> </p> <p>The present is thrown out with scarcely time to become familiar; before a new future emerges to assert itself.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sure, we're proud of our record. Record economic stability in the first term.</p> <p> </p> <p>Record investment in the second.</p> <p> </p> <p>Record numbers of jobs in both.</p> <p> </p> <p>A fairer Britain, yes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Better than Tory Britain, I should hope so.</p> <p> </p> <p>But not yet a Britain in which as our constitution puts it: power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have professional parents you are five times more likely to go to university.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you live in a smart part of town you are half as likely to be the victim of crime.</p> <p> </p> <p>Company directors aren't the ones losing their pension.</p> <p> </p> <p>There is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country. We have raised the ceiling. We haven't broken it.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's great we introduced 2\u00bd hours free nursery education.</p> <p> </p> <p>But if your job means working til 5pm what good is that?</p> <p> </p> <p>The New Deal gave half a million youngsters a job. But what happens when they want a career?</p> <p> </p> <p>No inner city London borough now gets fewer than 40 per cent of its pupils with good GCSEs, up from as low as 25 per cent in 1997. That's still 60 per cent not good enough.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's wonderful that maximum waiting times have come down from 18 months in 1997 to six months by the end of next year.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I would not want a member of my family to wait in pain, let alone for 6 months.</p> <p> </p> <p>And we may have a stable economy, but every business I visit tells me however well Britain does now, within a decade hundreds of thousands of UK jobs will go to China and India unless we build a wholly new platform of economic opportunity in knowledge, skills and science.</p> <p> </p> <p>For the wealthy few, every one of those challenges of the future can be overcome.</p> <p> </p> <p>The third term mission is to overcome them for the many.</p> <p> </p> <p>Changing Britain for better. For good.</p> <p> </p> <p>Not a society where all succeed equally - that is utopia; but an opportunity society where all have an equal chance to succeed; that could and should be 21st century Britain under a Labour Government.</p> <p> </p> <p>Where nothing in your background, whether you're black or white, a man or a woman, able-bodied or disabled stands in the way of what your merit and hard work can achieve.</p> <p> </p> <p>Where hard working families who play by the rules are not going to see their opportunities blighted by those that don't.</p> <p> </p> <p>And where if any of our citizens, no matter how poor, is in sickness or need, they get the best care available without any regard to their wealth.</p> <p> </p> <p>Power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many not the few. </p> <p> </p> <p>Not our hands.</p> <p>But theirs.</p> <p> </p> <p>Fairness in the future will not be built on the state, structures, services and government of times gone by.</p> <p> </p> <p>Their values remain.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the reality of life has changed.</p> <p> </p> <p>The relationship between state and citizen has changed.</p> <p> </p> <p>People have grown up. They want to make their own life choices. Their expectations, their ambitions, their hopes are all different and higher. </p> <p> </p> <p>The 20th century traditional welfare state that did so much for so many has to be re-shaped as the opportunity society capable of liberation and advance every bit as substantial as the past but fitting the contours of the future.</p> <p> </p> <p>And this will be a progressive future as long as we remember that the reason for our struggle against injustice has always been to liberate the individual. The argument is not between those who do and those who do not love freedom. It is between the Conservatives who believe freedom requires only that Government stand back while the fittest and most privileged prosper. And we who understand, that freedom for the individual, for every individual, whatever their starting point in life, is best achieved through a just society and a strong community.</p> <p> </p> <p>In an opportunity society, as opposed to the old welfare state, government does not dictate; it empowers.</p> <p> </p> <p>It makes the individual - patient, parent, law-abiding citizen, job-seeker - the driver of the system, not the state.</p> <p> </p> <p>It sets free the huge talent of our public servants and social entrepreneurs whose ability is often thwarted by outdated rules and government bureaucracy. </p> <p> </p> <p>It changes how government works, to open up the means of delivery to every resource, public, private and voluntary that can deliver opportunity based on need not wealth.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sometimes I hear people describe \"choice\" as a Tory word. It reminds me of when I first used to knock on doors as a canvasser and was told if they owned their own home they were Tories.</p> <p> </p> <p>Choice a Tory word?</p> <p> </p> <p>Tell that to 50 per cent of heart patients who have exercised it to get swifter operations and help bring cardiac deaths down 16,000 since we came to power. </p> <p> </p> <p>Or to the parents who have made the new City Academy Schools so popular in areas of the greatest social disadvantage.</p> <p> </p> <p>Or the people I met in Teesside a couple of weeks ago who have transformed their neighbourhood, yes with Government money but most of all, by making their decisions, their choices about how it was spent and how their community was run.</p> <p> </p> <p>Choice is not a Tory word.</p> <p> </p> <p>Choice dependent on wealth; those are the Tory words. </p> <p> </p> <p>The right to demand the best and refuse the worst and do so not by virtue of your wealth but your equal status as a citizen, that's precisely what the modern Labour Party should stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>So here are ten things a future Labour third term can do for Britain's hard-working families.</p> <p> </p> <p>1. Widen the circle of opportunity by low mortgage rates, rising living standards and more jobs in every region of the UK; special help for first time homebuyers and in a week where the Tories are advocating an inheritance tax cut which gives \u00a32 billion to the richest 5 per cent of estates, Labour's priority will be tax relief for the millions of hard-working families not tax cuts for the wealthy few.</p> <p> </p> <p>2. A society where we put the same commitment to quality vocational skills as we do academic education, with new vocational courses at school, every adult given skills free of charge up to level 2 and further support for level 3, and 300,000 Modern Apprenticeships at the workplace.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Every parent with the choice of a good specialist school, 200 new City Academies all in areas of deprivation, but with no return to selection at 11; new powers for heads to tackle disruptive pupils; all secondary schools part of the Building Schools for the Future programme, and as each wave of schools is rebuilt, modern sports facilities in every one, with a guaranteed number of hours of sport per week. And let's work to bring the Olympics to London in 2012 and have a sporting legacy not just for the capital but for the whole country.</p> <p> </p> <p>4. All patients able to choose their hospital, to book the time and date for treatment. Maximum waiting times down from eighteen months to eighteen weeks. 100 new hospital schemes, 2,700 GP premises improved and modernised already with more to come, life expectancy up, cardiac and cancer deaths down.</p> <p>The NHS safe in the patient's hands.</p> <p> </p> <p>5. Life made easier for families. More choice for mums at home and at work. Universal, affordable and flexible childcare for the parents of all 3-14 year-olds who want it from 8am in the morning to 6 at night and a Sure Start Children's Centre in every community of Britain.</p> <p> </p> <p>6. Security and dignity for everyone in retirement. Year by year we will work to increase the numbers who can move off benefit and into work, whether from Job Seekers Allowance, Incapacity Benefit or any other benefit, and with the money saved, design a pension system that has the basic state pension at its core; gives special help to the poorest and provides incentives to save for hard-working families whatever their wealth or income.</p> <p> </p> <p>7. Our country and its people prospering in the knowledge economy. Increasing by \u00a31 billion the investment in science, boosting support to small businesses and ending the digital divide by bringing broadband technology to every home in Britain that wants it by 2008.</p> <p> </p> <p>8. On the back of the success of the ASB legislation and record numbers of police, we will take a new approach to the whole of law and order. </p> <p>By the end of the next Parliament, all communities with their own dedicated policing team ; and the local community as well as the police have a say how it is policed. </p> <p>There will be a radical extension of compulsory drug testing for offenders; a doubling of investment in drug treatment; summary powers to deal with drug dealers and with the violence from binge-drinking; and those believed to be part of organised crime will have their assets confiscated, their bank accounts opened up and if they intimidate juries, face trial without a jury. </p> <p> </p> <p>9. We will introduce identity cards and electronic registration of all who cross our borders. We have cut radically the numbers of failed asylum seekers. By the end of 2005, and for the first time in Britain, we will remove more each month than apply and so restore faith in a system that we know has been abused.</p> <p> </p> <p>But we will welcome lawful migrants to this country; we will praise not apologise for our multi-cultural society and we will never play politics with the issue of race.</p> <p> </p> <p>10. A fair deal for all at work. An opportunity society is one in which we stop ignoring the lives of the millions of hard working low paid families who do the jobs that we all rely on. The jobs that get overlooked, the workers who we too often see right through, walk straight past, take for granted. The office cleaners who do the early morning shift, clearing away the mess before the office is filled. The security guards staying vigilant through the night. The dinner ladies, who cook meals for hundreds of kids in the school canteen five days a week. The hospital porters who often do as much for patient care as the nurse. For them, we offer not just the respect they deserve, but the guarantee of a decent income, a rising minimum wage, equal pay between men and women, four weeks paid holidays from now on plus bank holidays. </p> <p> </p> <p>There they are: ten pointers to what a third term Labour government would do for Britain's hard-working families.</p> <p>Don't tell me that's not worth fighting for.</p> <p> </p> <p>A stronger, fairer, more prosperous nation.</p>",
  "In her light blue uniform, Ayelech Kebede is a familiar figure in her community. She is a volunteer, known as a CBD agent, who distributes contraception to the women of Theodros Squat, a slum area in Addis Ababa, on behalf of MSIE. <p>The community is very poor and comprises former soldiers and their families who were displaced after a change in government in 1991. They have ended up crowded on a small piece of land in Ethiopia's capital without jobs, funds or facilities. </p> <p>Ayelech's home is her headquarters. She lives in a one-roomed shack with a low door, off a muddy lane. The walls are papered with pages from newspapers. In one corner stands a cupboard containing a supply of contraceptives and her delivery kit: a bag with forceps, an apron, alcohol for disinfectant, thread and cotton wool. It is all she needs to deliver a baby in an emergency. </p> <p>Ayelech's clients visit her here when they need contraceptives or advice. She tracks their menstrual cycles, writing their details in her tatty notebook, recording every appointment. Her client base is mostly married women like Zelalem Kelelaw, a cheery matron who is bent over a metal drum, scrubbing her family's clothes by hand as the rain starts to fall. After Ayelech introduced her to contraceptives, Zelalam could limit her brood - to seven. </p> <p>Other CBD agents across town are worse off than Ayelech. MSIE has had to close down a health post - a basic health centre - as a result of budget cuts, after the Mexico City Policy withdrew US funding to MSIE. </p> <p>The agents say they are tired of telling the community 'to hang on' for contraceptives to come. One agent, Ayeleh Kebed, describes how she took a pregnant girl off the street, delivering the baby in her own home. After the birth, the girl ran away leaving the infant behind. Ayeleh is looking after the child as her own. 'I called her Yabesera, meaning God's work,' she says with a smile. <br><b>ME</b></p>",

  "<p>Beyond the glittering goal of gap year cash in hand, it's vital to have a fairly realistic idea of what to expect in the job on the whole, which, at the end of the day, will be a job like any other with its highs and lows. </p> <p>If you're in it for the teaching, the highs come from the opportunity Tefl gives you to \"work with people\". </p> <p>Teaching motivated and interested students, gaining fascinating close-ups on people from all walks of life, beliefs and cultures and seeing them progress in English using the language you gave them, is a highly energising and uplifting experience. </p> <p>Low points often centre around the fact most language schools are private organisations that have to make money. As one of the teachers you may not feel that the people who own and run the school necessarily appreciate the lengths you go to every day to devise entertaining, amusing, interesting, creative, productive lessons for your students. Schools also expect you to be available to work stretched out days with early morning and late evening lessons, which can test the \"show must go on\" levels of professionalism the job requires. The first six months in Tefl will seem quite manic, with lots still to learn and a perpetual list of lessons to plan. It takes a while to fully appreciate different students' levels and needs, and to build up a file of popular five-minute activities, ice breakers, language games and favourite book chapters to deal with the bulk of it. </p> <p>Many schools use internationally acknowledged course books these days, which take hours out of planning, preparing, cutting and pasting, but it's still good to have something up your sleeve for last-minute lessons and unexpected situations. Your new-found colleagues are a valuable source of inspiration, and will generally help out when time is against you and the photocopier runs out of toner. </p> <p>Some will argue that lesson planning will always take a long time, and that you never stop learning and finding ways to improve. This is true, but after a while you do see parallels in your groups' levels and you start to be able to double up and redo activities, which saves a lot of time.</p> <p>And it's the time out of school that will act as a constant reminder of how good life can be. Whether it's a sacred early morning caffe on the piazza, or a pint of something local with other teachers of an evening, you'll soon know why you made the move, and start to enjoy the new rhythm of things.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Daniels has walked out of The Farm after fewer than 72 hours on the Five reality show following a furious bust-up with fellow contestant Vanilla Ice.</p> <p>The TV magician quit this morning but failed to persuade his wife Debbie McGee to follow him. Daniels rowed with former rap star Ice - real name Robert van Winkle - in a discussion about the Iraq war. Five bosses are considering whether to send in a replacement.</p> <p>\"It all kicked off with an argument about politics and the war,\" said a Five spokesman. \"Vanilla is very pro-American and in your face, and Paul took exception to him. The pair of them squared up and Paul wagged his finger in his face. </p> <p>\"Paul slept on it last night but, when he woke up this morning and discovered there was no wood in the Aga he decided enough was enough. He had a heart-to-heart with Debbie and asked her to leave as well but she is enjoying life on the farm so much she told him she wanted to stay.\"</p> <p>Last night's argument began when two of the other contestants on the show, Stan Collymore and Margi Clarke, discussed whether negotiation could be used to free Ken Bigley, the British hostage being held in Iraq.</p> <p>Vanilla Ice said he was \"sickened\" by the idea. \"All Britain cares about is publicity,\" he said. \"That's why you're going to negotiate with those weak-ass terrorists. You can't negotiate, that means they've won. [The US] is not soft. We are the protectors, the superpower, and we will win!\"</p> <p>Daniels and Collymore then suggested the US had only invaded Iraq for oil. The former rapper accused them of being brainwashed. \"Take a poll,\" he said. \"Ask the world 'did Saddam need to get got?' and you will get a 'yes'.\"</p> <p>It was the second row on The Farm in as many nights following a heated discussion about racism on Sunday. Daniels' exit leaves eight contestants on the show: Ice, Collymore, Clarke, McGee, former Five star Ritchie Neville, Rebecca Loos, Lady Victoria Hervey and Jade Goody's ex-boyfriend Jeff Brazier. Hervey replaced former Wonderbra model Sophie Anderton, who dropped out at the last minute.</p> <p>The Farm began with 1.1 million viewers on Sunday night, adding 100,000 viewers last night. Five will be hoping the show generates better ratings than its last reality effort, Back to Reality, which suffered from poor scheduling. The new show, produced by the Big Brother producer, Endemol, has been given a fixed 10pm slot.</p> <p>A Five spokesman said he was pleased with the way the show has begun. Contestants will be voted off the show from Saturday. \"We have been encouraged by the start it has made. All reality shows have grown from the first night, as we have done. There seems to be a really good group dynamic already.\"</p> <p>Viewers do not appear to be too sorry to see Daniels go. \"What has happened to Paul?\" emailed one. \"It doesn't matter, he was boring anyway,\" replied another.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>There's not much doubt about the educational value of having children interact with culture - with artists and artisans, musicians, theatre companies and so on. Actually doing it, of course, raises all sorts of practical and financial problems, not to mention the health and safety issues that are making it increasingly difficult to get children involved with projects outside the school walls. </p> <p>Fortunately, the widespread availability of broadband internet connections can now be used to bridge the gap between classroom and culture. And the government has set up Culture Online to do exactly that. It is being run by a small group from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), so its target audience goes well beyond the classroom, but most of it could be of educational use. </p> <p>Jonathan Drori, director of Culture Online, says that \"between 50% and 60% of our projects are designed for school-age children, but that doesn't mean they have to be used in school: we want to get to kids through outreach groups as well\". </p> <p>The first dozen projects range from ArtisanCam, which provides a sort of \"virtual artist in residence\", to World War II Remembered, a joint project with the BBC and Age Concern. However, some of the sites are derived from educational projects, or are already being used in schools with great success. These include ArtisanCam, Headline History, Stagework (formerly called Backstage), and WebPlayUK. Every Object Tells A Story and SoundWorlds have also been developed with classroom work in mind. </p> <p>Keith Alexander, the content director of ArtisanCam North, says the plan is to feature a different artist each term. They did the sculptor Lizzie Farey this summer, the potter Mike Eden kicks off the autumn term on October 4, and Paul Scott will do screen printing in the spring. Alexander says being able to watch the artist lead you through the process brings the activity to life, and kids can ask questions via videoconferencing. They get many of the advantages of an artist in residence scheme, but in a format that is easier for schools to organise, and far cheaper. </p> <p>The project also involves developing tools for \"virtual par ticipation\". For example, kids will be able to decorate and fire a bowl like Mike Eden, but do it all using software. \"In the spring, we're doing a virtual screen printing tool,\" says Alexander. </p> <p>The local involvement makes it different from using videos of, for example, kite-making in Mexico. Local artists and craftspeople act as role models for the children, and there can be the opportunity for follow-ups such as going to exhibitions. </p> <p>Headline History creates involvement by getting children to play at being investigative reporters, and they can put pre-set questions to video clips of actors playing historical characters. Richard Gerver, head of Grange primary school in Long Eaton, says: \"It's very purposeful. It's not just a question of pointing and clicking, children really have to interact with it.\" He says the site helps them develop skills, rather than being knowledge-driven. </p> <p>Gerver's school was a test site for the publisher of Headline History, Northcliffe Electronic Publishing, and he says he was delighted when he realised it was going to be a free resource for everyone to use. \"Things that are free often aren't very good, but this is really high quality. They have drawn very heavily on schools' opinions in order to get it right,\" he says. </p> <p>WebPlayUK was one of the earliest projects, and grew out of the successful WebPlay project, which connected schools across the Atlantic. This year, WebPlayUK has expanded to 30 classes of children working with one theatre company, Hoipolloi. </p> <p>The project involves children in creating a two-minute play about their partner school, via the Think.com website, before they all meet up for a live performance. </p> <p>Gina Southey, from Kings Norton primary school in Birmingham, participated in the pilot project and has now been seconded part-time to help with training and support. She says: \"Speaking as a teacher, it's brilliant: I've done it, and I truly believe in it. I saw all the children being enthused with the project and developing their skills. </p> <p>\"The teacher pack that we've developed has been planned with both core and extension activities, and how they can fit into their curriculum.\" </p> <p>WebPlayUK has already been evaluated, and Professor Angela McFarlane, from Bristol University, wrote that: \"Overall, WebPlay has proved a joyous experience for all involved, resulting in a highly memorable and in most cases very impressive set of outcomes. We found no children for whom this had been a negative or even neutral experience ... There is no doubt this experience will be one of the highlights of these children's primary school careers.\" </p> <p>There's a fair chance that other projects will also turn out well because of Culture Online's contract-based approach. It is not handing out grants from the government money tree. Drori says: \"If they don't deliver what they said they would, they don't get paid. That can come as a bit of shock to some of the groups involved, so we've learned to spell it out up front!\" </p> <p>Part of the idea is to encourage the project developers to be entrepreneurial, and if the results are attractive enough to become commercially successful, the government will take a cut of the profits, above an agreed level. \"As long as we do things in ways that are legal and decent, I'm absolutely delighted if there are commercial spin-offs,\" says Drori. \"And if there's something that can be sold, we think the taxpayer should get a cut of that.\" </p> <p>So, as well as reaching the public, and school-age children in particular, Culture Online is trying to revitalise the culture industry - in Drori's words, \"the museums and galleries, the broadcasters, the publishers, the freelancers and so on\" - and also help the government to find new ways to manage innovation and risk. This new approach is being evaluated by the National Audit Office.

  "<p>The German finance minister, Hans Eichel, today warned that global growth would be at risk if oil prices remained at their current levels.</p> <p>\"There will certainly be an effect on growth if such a high oil price is sustained,\" he said. \"We don't have a supply problem at the moment, but one of a relatively strong speculative element.\" </p> <p>Mr Eichel's comments - made a few days before Friday's G7 meeting of the world's seven leading industrialised countries - came as oil prices reached new highs after breaching the $50 (\u00a327.5) mark.</p> <p>US light crude, which has gone up 55% this year, this morning reached a high of $50.4, while Brent crude set a new peak at $46.8 a barrel before dropping back to $46.5, up 57 cents from yesterday. </p> <p>The impetus for the latest price rise came after Nigerian rebels warned companies to stop production in the Niger delta before they declared an all out war on October 1. The threat to supplies from Nigeria - the world's seventh largest oil exporter - comes with producers already at full stretch to meet the fastest growth in demand for 24 years. </p> <p>Companies working in the delta, the source of Nigeria's 2.3m barrels a day, have shrugged off the threat. Nigeria's top foreign producer, Shell - which had already reportedly cut production because of security concerns - said it saw no reason to stop producing. </p> <p>Italy's Agip, a unit of ENI, also said it did not plan to halt output. Nevertheless, concern over Nigeria's supplies has added to supply fears over Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia. </p> <p>The Opec oil cartel, which controls more than half of global crude exports, is producing around 30m barrels a day - production levels not seen since the late 70s. Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the Opec president, said the group was powerless to bring prices down. </p> <p>Opec raised production quotas with effect from November 1, but the move had little impact because it is already pumping well over official limits. While the group says it has 1.5m barrels a day of spare production capacity, the extra crude is not of the quality best suited to transport fuels. </p> <p>\"At the moment there's nothing we can do - Opec has spare capacity. However, whatever we do, there is no sensitivity in the market,\" Mr Purnomo, who is also Indonesia's oil minister, told Reuters. </p> <p>A series of hurricanes in the oil-producing Gulf of Mexico has accelerated the price, delaying shipments and disrupting offshore production and refinery operations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, news last week that US crude stocks had fallen for the last eight weeks and were running at a 13m barrel deficit compared with a year ago - at a time when they should be building ahead of winter - has also put prices under pressure.</p> <p>In real terms, stripping out inflation, oil prices are now near the levels they reached during the Arab oil embargo of 1973-4. However, they remain much lower than the record $80 annual average high reached following the 1979 Iranian revolution. </p> <p>The head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Claude Mandil, said the surge in oil prices was not justified by supply and demand, and there was no need for a release of emergency stocks.</p> <p>\"It is still the case ... supply is more than demand,\" Mr Mandil said. \"Of course there are some risks, and the market anticipates that these risks could occur, but as long as these risks do not occur I don't see why we would release the stocks.\" </p> <p>Like Mr Eichel, the EU energy commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, said the rise in oil prices was mainly due to speculation in the market and not a shortage of supply. </p> <p>\"I think that Opec, in the actual moment, has not a large margin of manoeuvre. I think they are trying really to keep their targets because there is a lack of credibility of the Opec in this moment,\" she said. \"It's not a problem of shortage in the market, it's a problem related with speculation.\"</p>",
  "Earlier this year, 15 foetuses were found dumped in a river in Nairobi, Kenya. A night watchman reportedly spotted men unloading black plastic bags from a vehicle into the Ngong river. His discovery sparked a public outcry and helped to reinforce opposition against abortion in the east African country: especially when it was discovered that at least one of the bags contained a foetus that was almost full-term. <p>Kenyan health minister Charity Ngilu says abortion will never be used as a solution to unwanted pregnancy, while the police quickly launched investigations to track down the mothers and offending doctors. Abortion in Kenya is illegal, except if there is a severe threat to the physical and mental health of the mother. It carries a penalty of 14 years in prison for the abortionist and seven for the mother. </p> <p>Despite this harsh law, about 300,000 abortions are carried out every year in Kenya. Many of these are done secretly with a range of instruments including dirty sticks and pieces of metal wire, or by using toxic chemicals and violent massage. These crude interventions cause miscarriage, excessive bleeding, ulceration, infection and, at times, irreparable damage to the woman's health. It is estimated that at least 2,500 women die annually from botched terminations. Statistics also suggest that many Kenyan women would like to use contraceptives but are unable to access them. The situation has been tragically compounded by the US policy on foreign funding - formally called the Mexico City Policy, but dubbed the global gag rule. </p> <p>'The rule was ill advised and its impact is wider than has really been quantified. What I can say for sure is that it's like passing a death sentence on a number of women who otherwise would have been saved,' says Dr Solomon Orero, one of Kenya's most authoritative gynaecologists. He specialises in post-abortion care, harnessing foreign and local funding to develop facilities - particularly in remote, under-serviced areas - for women to receive lifesaving medical care after unsafe abortions. </p> <p>Orero argues that a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy must be seen in the context of the life she lives. Most Kenyans are poor by western standards and it is a struggle for them to access basic healthcare. Despite a government commitment to family planning, the use of contraception has stagnated in Kenya at 1998 levels, with the average mother bearing five children. </p> <p>'Here is a woman who is illiterate most of the time, who is ignorant most of the time, who has no rights most of the time, who has no opinion most the time,' says Orero. 'What then happens is that woman, who is poor most of the time, will be powerless to do anything about the complications from an unwanted pregnancy.' </p> <p>This category of woman, Orero says, has become a victim of US anti-abortion foreign policy. They are often dependent on family planning organisations, places that have lost funding for refusing to sign the global gag rule. The politics of the richest nation are arbitrarily affecting the lives of those on the poorest continent. </p> <p>Kenya's most prominent family-planning NGO, the Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK), for example, is poised to close half of its clinics this year. It has already closed three. If it cannot find more funds, only four will remain by December. 'It has been disastrous for us,' says executive director Godwin Mzenge. 'When the global gag rule took effect, USAID was funding five out of 14 clinics as well as community-based activities and volunteers.' </p> <p>Previously, USAID funding provided training, personnel costs, clinic supplies and overheads. It even helped to fund the purchase of the FPAK head office building. Similarly, Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK), which provides half of all family planning in Kenya, has lost resources. </p> <p>'In this country, 60% of the population are young people moving into their reproductive age,' says Cyprian Awiti, programme director of MSK. 'There is a strong need for reproductive health, family planning, the management of sexually transmitted disease, HIV/Aids treatment and safe motherhood.' </p> <p>As a little boy, Awiti witnessed his mother preparing to give birth to his sister 'between stones' near his village in rural west Kenya. It was the traditional way to give birth. 'When my mother was about to go into labour, she walked out of the house and there were two stones,' he says. 'She supported her back with one stone, and with her legs on the other, she pushed out the child.' </p> <p>In Awiti's lifetime, Kenya has undergone limited modernisation, particularly in urban areas, but the government is still battling to provide health services. From the private sector, Awiti has worked hard to develop a network of Marie Stopes clinics and community programmes to give women like his mother better access to reproductive health services. Now he's up against the global gag rule. </p> <p>'We have lost about 30% of our services as a result,' Awiti says. 'We are not able to reach as many women in the rural areas as we had planned with the funding from the US. We had to close two facilities that were very dear to us.' </p> <p>One of the former Marie Stopes clinics now stands boarded up in a dirty alley in Mathare, Nairobi. Groups of unsupervised children play and scamper nearby in mounds of litter. A 15-year-old among them has a baby tied to her back. </p> <p>'If this clinic was open, she wouldn't have become pregnant,' says Rose Cheche, a volunteer who used to work from the clinic in this community. 'Since it closed, the people have not been happy. Patients who are pregnant have nowhere to go. The place where you can buy the pill is far from here and the transport costs are high.' </p> <p>Josephine Musyoka, a mother of seven, used to go to an FPAK clinic in the slum of Eastleigh. 'Ever since the clinic closed, I have found it difficult to pay for family planning. The transport costs to the government clinic are high. I have also noticed that prices have increased at the new facility, and, as I don't work, I can't afford them,' she says. </p> <p>Musyoka is softly spoken and a little shy. She says that she and her friends do not like going to the government clinic as the officials are insensitive and do not spend time on consultations. But city dwellers like Musyoka are better off than their rural sisters. Such women now have to travel up to 50km from their homes to acquire contraceptives, according to Mzenge. Roads are treacherous and long trips are expensive. Previously, community volunteers formed a network through urban and rural Kenya providing both contraceptives and counselling. Without NGO resources, many are no longer serving women's needs. </p> <p>'The woman loses more than just a packet of pills. In fact, I would say that a packet of pills is an entry point to giving the woman health education on issues of nutrition, breast-feeding, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/Aids,' Mzenge says. He adds that many Kenyans are now interpreting the cutbacks as a sign that family planning is no longer a priority. To start them up again at a later stage would be difficult due to scepticism from disappointed clients. </p> <p>The despair in Kenya is matched by concerns felt by similar organisations in Africa's second most populous country: Ethiopia. Of all Africans, Ethiopians use contraception the least. Ethiopia's health service reaches only half of its people. As in Kenya, abortion is illegal, and the maternal mortality rate is alarmingly high at 871 deaths for every 100,000 births. </p> <p>'According to some studies, 54% of these deaths are the result of unsafe abortion,' says Getachew Bekele, programme director of Marie Stopes International Ethiopia (MSIE). </p> <p>MSIE has had to reduce its community-based programmes and has already closed down three health posts that distributed contraceptives to communities. As in Kenya, many people now have to travel long distances for these services. </p> <p>'When we were told to sign the agreement of the Mexico City Policy, it was not an easy decision,' says Amare Bedada, executive director of the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE), the country's largest family planning organisation. 'It was a big dilemma for us. 'The FGAE is committed to advocating safe abortion and felt it could not betray its principles. 'In addition to this, we are working with youth and we cannot refuse counselling or be unsympathetic to somebody with a problem.' </p> <p>As a consequence of its decision, USAID withdrew support for the FGAE, which then lost almost 35% of its external funds. The FGAE built up its services and networks over four decades, but was suddenly forced to cancel numerous outreach programmes, reduce the number of volunteers from 1,000 to 90 and cut its staff. </p> <p>Ude is one of the small rural villages losing out as a result of the funding crisis. It is a two-hour drive south of the capital, Addis Ababa. Most people in Ude travel on foot or by donkey cart. Defaru Jima, a local farmer, is the volunteer responsible for contraception in the village. FGAE gave him a multicoloured bicycle on which to do his rounds to distribute pills and information. His health post is a mudwalled hut that is almost completely bare save for some faded posters offering graphic warnings against unsafe abortion, advice to new mothers and displaying contraceptive pill samples. Jima says he opens the post twice a week, but he looks dispirited. His stipend has been cut and there have been no refresher courses. </p> <p>'One of the CBD nurses has been laid off, and I have not received my uniform, which is important for my identity as a volunteer,' Jima says. He has complained to the nearest FGAE branch in Nazareth, a bustling commercial centre. Mohammed Yimer, the head of planning at the clinic, is trying to stretch his reduced budget to meet the needs of the community. Five senior members of staff have been retrenched, including the laboratory technician and a senior nurse. </p> <p> 'The funding was substantially withdrawn due to the global gag rule. We are in a serious and critical period,' Yimer explains. 'Almost 20% of our budget was from that source. We have been forced to reduce our staff. People don't believe us any more. They were expecting us - requesting us - to expand the services to create more access for other rural areas, but, instead, we have stopped some activities, training for volunteers and the provision of uniforms and other supplies. The overall programme was totally paralysed for a time.' </p> <p> As Yimer leaves for a field visit, he shows us a waiting room filled with young women, many of whom are pregnant. The rape and abduction of young girls is common in Ethiopia. Unmarried pregnant girls are disowned by their communities, such is the shame, and forced into domestic work or prostitution. Traditional attitudes to women can be inflexible. Many families practise female genital mutilation as a rite of passage for young girls. </p> <p> It is estimated that 36% of married Ethiopian women cannot obtain contraceptives when they want them. The NGO community promotes reproductive rights for women, but it has yet to overcome resistance from traditional and religious leaders within this comparatively conservative society. The legalisation of abortion is one of the most contested issues in Ethiopia. </p> <p> 'The gag rule is having a chilling effect on this heated debate,' says Bedada. 'People cite the example of the US policy and raise the question that if the US - a country that has extensive experience in making abortion legal - recoils, it is certain that many people will consider abortion inappropriate.' </p> <p> 'The latest policy of the US has stopped some of the most innovative programmes in this country,' says Sahlu Haile, the senior programme adviser of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. 'It takes several years or decades to develop reproductive health programmes, but only a single day to destroy them.' </p> <p> The foundation stepped in to temper some of the losses of affected organisations. However, Haile estimates that the funds provided by donors fall short of the $100m a year Ethiopia needs for family planning. He worries about the shortages of contraceptive supplies. </p> <p> 'It's a serious problem, because if the family planning organisation runs out of contraceptives for three months, it is dead. There are no alternatives for a rural woman: if she does not get contraception, she'll become pregnant. It is criminal to start something you can't continue.' </p> <p> Many African governments rely heavily on international donors to provide family planning commodities: stocks of contraceptive pills, injections and condoms. Recently, supplies have been erratic, leading to sporadic shortages, which has demoralised family planning organisations. Haile is critical of the Ethiopian government for its half-hearted commitment in delivering contraception and for not resolving the population crisis, which he says worsens poverty. </p> <p> The head of the Ethiopian National Population Office, Hiruy Mitiku, blames 'petty operational problems' for the breakdown in the distribution of contraceptives. He says the government has failed to create an effective healthcare system. Ethiopia has set challenging goals for itself: reducing the maternal mortality rate by half by 2015, and bringing down the fertility rate so the average Ethiopian woman has four children instead of eight. But these targets are unlikely to be met. </p> <p> 'The rapid population growth is eating up our development efforts in this country and frustrating the whole thing,' Mitiku says. He agrees that the re-instatement of the Mexico City policy was a blow to the government. 'It has affected us quite a lot. The NGOs were trying to penetrate deep into the rural areas and support our service,' he says. </p> <p> The family planning associations have also been hit by an unexpected problem. The focus on HIV/Aids has meant that international funding is diverted to what is perceived as a more urgent global crisis, and they say reproductive health is taking a back seat. Internationally and domestically, there is insufficient political will and money to make up the shortfall. </p> <p> 'Our government is always broke, so we could not turn to it and say, \"Could you extend a helping hand here?\"' says Mzenge. </p> <p> The head of the Kenyan Population Services, Doctor Richard Muga, admits there is not enough money to meet the reproductive health needs of Kenyan women. But he is loath to say who is to blame. </p> <p> 'When these resources don't come, it is a nightmare for the people of Kenya, 'Muga says. 'A message should go out there that sub-Saharan Africa - Kenya included - still needs this support. So out there, anybody who cares, they need to hear.'</p>",

  "In May 2004, Bolivia's president, Carlos Mayo, was due to sign a bill that was going to give the Bolivian people the explicit right to family planning for the first time. Then he got a letter from the council of bishops, and reconsidered. Having been passed by both houses of the Bolivian congress, the bill has now slipped into limbo. Bolivia's elected politicians, according to Marie Stopes Bolivia's Ramon Torre, come a definite third place when it comes to who makes decisions about the rights of the country's people. <p>'USAID and the American embassy are the biggest influence on these questions, and the Catholic church is always intervening: they don't want to hear anything about contraception.' </p> <p>That seems to confirm what many people might expect to hear about family planning, contraception and women's rights in Latin America: what can you expect of a continent caught between the US and the Catholic church? </p> <p>Yet that is far from the whole story. Most Latin American countries - Bolivia is an exception - have a long history of government family planning programmes; abortion is off the agenda, but condoms certainly are not. 'For at least 20 years, the Mexican government has had a successful family planning policy, with real results,' says Laura Miranda, of Marie Stopes Mexico. 'Recently, getting emergency contraception accepted as part of government policy has been a big step forwards.' </p> <p>And it's not just about governments. Most Latin American countries, with their highly politicised populations, have a tradition of pressure groups, and women's organisations are an important part of political life in countries such as Mexico.That is one of the explanations why, at July's Economic Council for Latin America and the Caribbean conference in Puerto Rico, the Latin Americans - including the hosts, a US-dependent territory - held out against US pressure to make a statement backing away from the commitments of the 1994 international conference on population and development. </p> <p>Eventually, the US agreed to a statement endorsing the 1994 declaration, while, along with El Salvador and Costa Rica, adding their own clarification saying they did not support abortion rights or sex education without the permission of parents. </p> <p>And in practice, people who have worked in Latin America will tell you, individual Catholic priests have even been known to hand out condoms. That is not surprising considering the problems that remain: 450,000 women under 20 become pregnant every year in Mexico. Sexually transmitted infections are among the top 10 causes of death in that country. In Nicaragua, 29% of women in couples have suffered some form of physical or sexual violence. </p> <p>Against this, there is a lack of resources. Although government budgets are still under pressure from huge debt repayments, Latin America is simply not poor enough - or strategically important enough - to get much international aid. </p> <p>It turns out there is no one story in Latin America: hope in Mexico and Brazil must be balanced out against pessimism in Honduras and Bolivia. 'Things are getting worse,' Torre says, 'Because of the pressure from the Bush administration, and the Catholic church, we're going backwards. It's the poor who are suffering.'</p>",

  "<p>I decide to try a new approach to pecking at the boulder with my knife. Selecting a fist-sized stone from the pile below my feet, I manoeuvre it to the top. Now that it's in reach, I stretch and grab the rock - not without a spike of pain from my trapped wrist - and set the 10lb stone on top of the boulder next to my knife. I've already discounted the idea of smashing a smaller rock directly against the chockstone, as all the available rocks are of the softer pink sandstone, like the walls. Instead, I plan to use the rock to pound my knife into the chockstone, like a hammer and chisel. </p> <p>In preparation, I balance my knife so that the tip fits in the slight groove that I have carved in the side of the boulder, just above my right wrist, and lean the handle against the canyon wall. I grip the hammer rock tightly to ensure I will accurately hit the head of the knife and bring the hammer down in a gentle trial tap. I'm afraid the rock will kick the knife off the backside of the boulder or down into the rocks beneath my feet. My chiselling set-up is as stable as I can manage, but it doesn't instil much confidence, so I tap the knife carefully a second and third time just to test if it will skitter away. It stays put, but I need to hit harder. </p> <p>Here goes ... I drive the hammer rock into my knife hard. Karunch! The rock detonates in my hand, splitting into one large and a half-dozen smaller pieces, leaving me with a handful of crumbling sandstone as shrapnel flies up into my face. The force of the blow knocks my knife off the chockstone, and it bounces off my shorts, hitting the sand half a yard in front of my right foot. \"I can't win here. Nothing's working,\" I think. </p> <p>I lick my lips and taste the coating of pulverised grit that has stuck to the dried sweat on my face. My knife is out of reach of my left hand, and nudging it with my foot only buries it in the sand. I take off my left shoe and sock again, grab the multi-tool in my outstretched toes, and retrieve it. </p> <p>\"Come on, Aron, no more stupid stuff like that,\" I chastise myself. \"That's the last thing you can afford, to lose your knife.\" </p> <p>Somehow I know it will be vital to my survival. Even though I'm certain it's too dull to saw through my arm bones, I might need it for other things, like cutting webbing, or maybe making my backpack into some kind of jacket to keep me warmer at night. </p> <p>It's just before 1.30am on Sunday when I open my water bottle for the second time and have a small sip. The water is expectedly refreshing, a reward for having gone so long since those first extravagant gulps some eight hours ago. Still, I worry. I know that the remaining 22 ounces are the key to my survival. But it's a puzzle as to how much I should drink or conserve and how long I should try to make it last. </p> <p>With fatigue buckling my knees, I decide to construct a seat that I can use to take my weight off my legs. Getting into my harness is the easy half of the equation. The hard part is getting some piece of my pared arsenal of climbing gear hung up on a rock overhead secure enough to hold my weight. </p> <p>I have my eye on a crack system that starts on the south wall, about six feet above and to the left of my head. But how can I fabricate a block to throw into the crack and pull it down until it catches at the pinch point? </p> <p>I unwrap about 30 feet of my climbing rope. At the end, I tie a series of overhand knots to make a fist-sized block, adding three carabiners from the climbing supplies to make a heavier lead. </p> <p>Each toss takes two minutes to set up, and my first dozen tries fall short, bouncing off the wall or the face of the chockstone, or slipping out of the crack before the carabiners can wedge tightly. Of the next dozen tries, five of them land my carabiners in the crack, but each time they pull free. With a brilliantly lucky throw on my next try, the carabiner bundle hits the wide mouth of the crack and drops into the pinch point, and with a tug at just the right moment, the block wedges tight. I test the constriction's strength and watch the carabiners bite into the rock. </p> <p>A wave of happiness washes over my tired mind, as I tie a figure-eight knot on a loop of the anchored rope and clip myself to the system. After a few adjustments, I finally lean back and take some weight off my legs. Ahhhhh. I relax for the first time, and my body celebrates after the strain of standing still for over 12 hours. </p> <p>In these coldest hours before dawn, I take up my knife again and hack at the chockstone. After a sip of water at 6am, I take stock: I estimate that at the rate I have averaged, I would have to chip at the rock for 150 hours to free my hand. Discouraged, I know I will need to do something else to improve my situation. </p> <p>Just after 8am, I turn off my headlamp. I have made it through the night. With the sunlight's presence, my emotional status lifts. </p> <p>I speculate on the odds of being found and the timing of when outside efforts will initiate a potential search. It looks bleak from every angle. My roommates will miss me, but they don't know where I am. If they should get so concerned as to notify the Aspen police, the authorities won't do anything until Tuesday night at the earliest. </p> <p>It seems more probable to me that my manager at the Ute Mountaineer, the outdoor gear store in Aspen where I work, will call my parents to find out why I haven't shown up for work. At that point, maybe they will get the police to poll my credit-card companies for my recent purchasing history and track me to Moab. </p> <p>If the police notify the National Park Service and the NPS initiates a general search on Wednesday, they're unlikely to find my vehicle right away - the commanders will focus on the areas closer to Moab first. A lucky strike, or more thorough, second-stage canvassing might mean that they pinpoint my truck on the first day of searching, Thursday. So by the time they sweep the canyon and move all the way through Blue John, it'll be Friday. </p> <p>Friday, then, before someone pops his or her head over that chockstone. And that's at the earliest. Without water, people die in a lot less than a week. I'll be astonished if I survive until Tuesday morning. There's no way I'll make it to Friday. </p> <p>But I'm ready for action, not for dying. It is time to get a better anchor established, one that I can use to rig a lifting system and try to move the boulder. If I can rotate the front of the chockstone up, maybe as much as a foot, I can pull out my hand. </p> <p>A shallow triangular horn of rock sticks out in the middle of the shelf nearly six feet above my head. My attempts to toss the webbing up over the horn founder. Time after time, the webbing pulls free and falls to the sand on the other side of my chockstone. </p> <p>Aha! This time, I tug the knot over the shelf's lip. Slowly reeling in the leader, I know I've got a workable setting for my anchor. Cutting my climbing rope about 30 feet from one end, I loop one end of the short piece around my chockstone and tie it to itself. Next I thread the other end up through the rappel ring. Without expecting any movement of the boulder, I yank on the rope. Sure enough, nothing. </p> <p>Well, at least the anchor is holding. </p> <p>I fashion a pulley system to create some mechanical advantage, theoretically tripling the force applied at the haul point. But because I'm using a dynamic climbing rope, meant to stretch and absorb the energy of a climbing fall, I lose much of the force I'm exerting. Friction between the rope and the carabiners dissipates the force even more. Maybe with pulleys I would have a chance, but not like this. The system is too weak. The boulder ignores my efforts. </p> <p>I reconsider my options. For the first time, I seriously contemplate amputating my arm. My two biggest concerns are a cutting tool that can do the job, and a tourniquet that will keep me from bleeding to death. There are two blades on my multi-tool: the short blade is sharper than the three-inch one. It will be important to use the longer blade for hacking at the chockstone and preserve the shorter blade for the potential surgery. </p> <p>I instinctively understand that even with the sharper blade, I won't be able to saw through my bones. I've seen the hacksaws that civil war-era doctors used for amputations in battlefield hospitals, and I don't have anything that could even approximate to a saw. </p> <p>As a test, I expose the shorter blade of my multi-tool and hold it to my skin. The tip pokes between the tendons and veins a few inches up from my trapped wrist, indenting my flesh. The sight repulses me. </p> <p>What are you doing, Aron? Get that knife away from your wrist! What are you trying to do, kill yourself? That's suicide! I don't care how good a tourniquet you have, you'll bleed out. Cutting your arm off is just a slow act of suicide. </p> <p>I no longer have any options that I haven't already examined and tabled as ineffective or deadly. I'm stymied at every turn. I'll die before help arrives, I can't excavate my hand, I can't lift the boulder, and I can't cut off my arm. A sinking depression hits me for the first time. I whimper to myself: \"I am going to die.\" </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>Around 3:35pm on Monday afternoon, I have to urinate. \"How is this possible?\" I wonder. I'm most certainly dehydrated. \"Save it, Aron. Pee into your CamelBak. You're going to need it.\" Obeying, I transfer the contents of my bladder into my empty water reservoir, saving the orangey-brown discharge for the unappetising but inevitable time when it will be the only liquid I have. </p> <p>Sitting in front of me at eye level on top of the chockstone, my translucent blue CamelBak reservoir makes the litre of brackish orange urine look brown in the dim evening light. After four hours, the urine has separated into stratified layers: a viscous brown soup on the bottom, a dingy orange fluid in the middle, a clear golden liquid on top. It reminds me of the yeast in the bottom of a bottle of home-brewed beer - but substantially less appealing. </p> <p>I return to the pattern of fidgeting and rest that helped me through last night, but I can get only 10 minutes of stillness from each cycle. It seems colder tonight, or perhaps I'm feeling the increased effects of starvation and dehydration on my body's metabolic systems. With the certain deterioration I've suffered since my entrapment began, I assume my body is not generating as much heat. </p> <p>Water. I pick up my Nalgene bottle and swirl the precious contents. Each tablespoon of water satisfies me like a whole mouthful, and instantly, I'm gulping at the dribbling flow. I close my eyes . . . Oh, God. After an all too brief three seconds, I swallow the last drops of my clean water supply, and it's gone. My body wails for the water to keep coming, but there is no more. Well, that's it, there's not a drop left. </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>It's 6.45 am on Tuesday morning. Shaking my head, I compose myself and look straight at the video camera for what I want to say. \"I tried cutting my arm off. I could barely break the skin with this stupid knife. I tried a couple different blades, but all I did was just mark myself up. </p> <p>\"I've had a couple pretty good sips of my own urine that I saved in my CamelBak. It tastes like hell. I have about a bite of burrito left that I can barely stomach anyways. </p> <p>\"I tried moving the rock some more. It's not going anywhere. Three days, I've been out of water for a day and a half. That probably means I've got another day and a half. I'm gonna hold strong. But if I even see Wednesday noon, I'll be amazed. </p> <p>\"Mom, Dad, I really love you guys. I wanted to take this time to say I love you. I'll always be with you.\" </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>It's Wednesday evening, more than four days since my entrapment began. Drinking sip after sip of urine from my grotesque stash in the Nalgene has eroded the inside of my mouth, leaving my palate raw, reminding me that I am going to die. </p> <p>I want to keep smashing at the chockstone with my hammer rock, but I can't bear the suffering it imposes on my left hand. Let it go, Aron. Leave the rock there. Why cause yourself any more pain when it's a futile endeavour to begin with? </p> <p>Clammy supernatural breezes suck the heat from my body, and my shivering escalates intensely. The canyon is an ice box. Each night has been progressively harder, but these are the killing winds. </p> <p>Counting from dusk till dawn, I get through only two of the painfully frigid nine hours before I decide it is time to make a final annotation. Above the four capitalised letters of my first name, \"ARON\", I scratch into the red rock, \"OCT 75\". Below my name, I make the complementary scratching, \"APR 03\". It doesn't occur to me to write \"May\", as I am certain I won't see the dawn at the far end of this hideously cold night. I finish the epitaph by carving \"RIP\" above my name and birth month, then I lean back in my harness and set the knife on top of the chockstone before I slip into a trance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is the second instalment in a three - part serialisation of Between a Rock and a Hard Place, by Aron Ralston, published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>",
  "Ali al-Shaer was delivered in separate ambulances to the mob awaiting his arrival with a mixture of fury and obscene fascination at the Nasser hospital. First came what remained of his charred torso after an Israeli rocket slammed into his car as it worked its way through the cluttered streets of Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp yesterday. <p>Minutes later, the Palestinian insurgent's head was delivered in the back of an ambulance followed by a cortege of young gunmen packed into a string of battered old Mercedes, apparently learning nothing about what had fallen from the sky minutes before. </p> <p>Their Kalashnikov's clattered against the doors as they got out of their car. One man collapsed in tears, then rediscovered his anger and let off a burst of gunfire as the doctors shook their heads in despair. The uproar at the hospital was a far cry from the resignation with which most Palestinians greet news of the all-too-routine \"targeted assassinations\". </p> <p>Yesterday's attack only wounded its intended target, Mohammed Abu Nseara, who his colleagues at the hospital said was involved in an assault that killed three Israeli soldiers guarding a neighbouring Jewish settlement last week. </p> <p>Abu Nseara was hauled out of the ambulance charred and appearing to all who scrutinised his bloodied and immobile face as if the Israelis might indeed have brought him to the brink of death. His family certainly thought so. One woman arrived at the hospital hitting anyone in her way as she demanded to see him. </p> <p>More gunfire, more threats to wipe out Israelis. The police decided that was the moment to retreat and leave the militiamen to their own devices. Minutes later, the crowd calmed as the doctors announced that Abu Nseara was pulling through. </p> <p>Lingering in a corner, away from the pressing crowd, was a man in a black T-shirt who gives his name to the outside world as Abu Haroun. Periodically he lifted a mobile phone to his lips for a burst of commentary on the unfolding scene. Abu Haroun is a member of the Abu Rish brigades, responsible for some of the recent attacks on Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>\"The Israelis got the wrong man,\" he said indifferently of the dead man. \"He was just the bodyguard.\" </p> <p>No sooner had Mr Shaer's head been delivered than the crowd was briefly stunned into silence by an Israeli tank shell landing nearby. Regaining its collective outrage, much of the mob headed out of the hospital gates and charged down the road in search of the expected victims. But the explosive had landed on a patch of open ground for reasons known only to the soldiers in the tank. </p> <p>The teenage boys who always crowd into the hospitals for a glimpse of the corpse threatened dire retribution. </p> <p>They were going to kill all the settlers, they said. They were going to kill a soldier that very day. It was highly likely that their fury would propel a few into the arms of the militias, just as every killing seems to fuel a desire to kill or an indifference to living. </p> <p>But the killing in southern Gaza is mostly one way with hundreds of Palestinians dead to less than a score of Israelis. </p> <p>A few hours earlier, the Israeli army shot dead a man in the grounds of a United Nations boys' primary school adjacent to Nasser hospital. </p> <p>The victim had come to visit a friend, the caretaker. The boys' school is opposite the UN's girls' primary school where 10-year-old Raghda Alassar was shot by a soldier at her desk three weeks ago. She died on Friday. Neither killing was deliberate, but stray bullets from indiscriminate gunfire by the army posts which caught innocent victims. Two weeks ago, an Israeli shell hit Nasser hospital, wounding a doctor and a nurse. </p> <p>As dusk fell on the refugee camp yesterday, its residents tended to be concerned less with the demise of Mr Shaer than news that their husbands and wives, mothers and fathers who work in Gaza City might not be home for the night. </p> <p>The army closed the only road from the north after Jewish settlers lined a bridge and pelted Palestinian cars below in protest at Ariel Sharon's plan to erase the settlements from the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>When a Palestinian throws a stone at an Israeli, the army defines it as an act of terrorism. It is one reason the Israeli government claims Palestinians are responsible for 23,000 acts of terrorism over the past four years of intifada. </p> <p>But the handling of the settlers is altogether a different matter. The army left them where they were. It was the Palestinian commuters - who had committed no crime - whom they told to go away. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Riad Ali, an Israeli Arab producer for CNN, was kidnapped at gunpoint on a busy street in Gaza City yesterday. His abductors have yet to issue any demand. Foreigners seized in Gaza have usually been released after a few hours.</p>",
  "<p>The Sudanese government and rebel groups fighting it in Darfur were urged to return to the negotiating table by the UN yesterday, amid new reports of desperate conditions in the refugee camps. </p> <p>The call from the UN high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, came as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said that mortality rates in south Darfur were \"way above emergency levels\". </p> <p>\"The time has come for the parties really to sit down at the negotiating table and sort things out,\" said Mr Lubbers in Darfur. </p> <p>\"We are not interested in political clashes, we are interested in a solution.\" </p> <p>Up to 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million have been forced to flee their homes since the war began last year. </p> <p>Peace talks broke down this month after two rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement, refused to disarm before the pro-government Janjaweed militias were disbanded. </p> <p>A ceasefire agreed in April has been broken by the government and the rebels. </p> <p>Mr Lubbers' visit follows that of the UN high com missioner for human rights, Louise Arbour, who said at the weekend that refugees in Darfur continued to live in fear. </p> <p>She said: \"People cannot envisage returning home because they do not trust the government of Sudan to protect them. </p> <p>\"At best they feel the authorities respond inadequately to their concerns, and at worst that they are in collusion with their abusers.\" </p> <p>Conditions in the vast camps in Darfur remain appalling. Infant malnutrition rates are running at nearly 25% in Kalma camp in south Darfur. </p> <p>Over the past seven months, around 2,500 people have died at Kalma, including 1,100 children under five. More than half the adult deaths were due to violence. </p> <p>Despite two UN security council resolutions, analysts say the Sudanese government has not come under sufficient international pressure to make it rein in the Janjaweed. </p> <p>\"History has shown that Khartoum will respond constructively to direct pressure, but this pressure must be concerted, consistent and genuine,\" the thinktank the International Crisis group said.</p>",
  "<p>It's been a tough few weeks for Harry Kroto. When not commuting to Korea and Croatia, he's been up at six, carting papers from his old office in the chemistry building at Sussex University to a glorified broom cupboard on the third floor. Not to mention cancelling the credit cards that disappeared from his desk in the move. Life as a Nobel laureate is all glamour.</p> <p>Navigating into his new den requires some athleticism. First you shuffle past a six-foot barrier of intrays, then you have to spin the one available chair to arrive at the only free space, next to his computer. Kroto is staring at an email. He is meant to be speaking in India next month and no one has remembered he needs a visa. Before long there's a knock at the door. It's a member of staff who's about to be laid off after 12 years, and Kroto is trying to juggle his grants to ensure the man gets the best possible pay-off. \"I just don't need all this,\" he mutters grumpily.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why Kroto has decided to up sticks after more than 30 years at Sussex. Next year he hits 65, and though he might have been able to squeeze a contract for another year or so, he couldn't face filling in more reams of research grant applications.</p> <p>So when Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee approached him with a bucketful of cash to continue his research in the US; guaranteed funding for the Vega Science Trust, his educational website; promised three months in the UK each year; and licence to continue his globetrotting activities, he was tempted.</p> <p>Even so, it took two years to make up his mind to go. \"I didn't really want to leave the country,\" he says, \"but in the end I didn't feel I had any other choice. No one else was offering me such a good deal. When I went to tell the vice-chancellor of my decision he said: 'You don't expect me to match FSU's offer.' I replied: 'No.' And that was that.\" It's sod's law that since Kroto went public with his decision, several UK universities have promised him the world.</p> <p>Kroto's parents fled Berlin in the 1930s, and he was brought up in Bolton. \"My father was an engineer,\" he says, \"and was always pushing me towards doing something useful. So I was naturally drawn towards chemistry.\" His first major achievement, though, had nothing to do with science: \"I was the Duke of York to Ian McKellen's Henry V in the school play. Quite properly, I was the only English knight to die at Agincourt.\"</p> <p>His second landmark achievement also had nothing to do with chemistry. Kroto has always been interested in graphics, and as a student won a newspaper competition to design a book jacket. Even now he likes to keep his hand in. He points to the NextGen logo on the fleece he's wearing. \"I got paid $2,500 [\u00a31,400] for that,\" he says. \"It's always been in the back of my mind that I could set up a graphics studio if science didn't work out.\"</p> <p>But science did work out. Kroto would have left his mark on chemistry with both his creation of carbon/phosphorous double-bonds - \"I recently saw a new chemistry textbook that said this was impossible some 25 years after I proved it was\" - and the discovery of carbon chains in space. Yet he was not to be denied a hat trick, and in 1985 made the big time with the discovery of buckminsterfullerenes (C <sub>60 </sub>), a third form of carbon after diamond and graphite, in soccer ball-shaped molecules of 60 atoms each.</p> <p>The discovery was a natural follow-on to his work on carbon chains and was made during a two-week period of experiments at Rice University, Texas, with American scientists Rick Smalley and Bob Curl. The existence of C <sub>60 </sub> had been hypothesised, but no one had predicted they might form spontaneously: \"It changed our understanding of nanostructures. Before that we thought that carbon atoms grouped in sheets - now we realised they closed in on one another to form closed balls.\"</p> <p>Kroto had been amazed at the strength of the radio signal given out by C <sub>60 </sub> and was confident of his findings. He went public with his conjecture, but even then wasn't sure the process was anything more than a minor part of the total system. This turned out to be a big mistake, and the next five years proved frustrating.</p> <p>First off, several groups of scientists dedicated their lives to proving him wrong: \"It all got a bit personal. Others had done exactly the same experiment as me and failed to spot the existence of C <sub>60 </sub>. They had literally let the Nobel prize slip through their hands.\" Next, Kroto overestimated the difficulties of extracting C <sub>60 </sub>, and put in a bid for funding for a mass spectrometer. For two years, the bid was rejected and in 1980, just a few weeks before he was due to publish his final proof, the German team of Kratschmer and Huffman got in first and won the plaudits.</p> <p>He was eventually rewarded with the Nobel prize in 1996, although he missed the phone call that informed him. \"You hear through the grapevine that you're in the running,\" he says, \"but on the day I forgot all about it and went out to the pub for lunch.\" </p> <p>The timing had a nice irony, for only hours before - causing huge embarrassment for the engineering and physical science research council - he had been refused a \u00a3100,000 grant for research into exactly the same subject.</p> <p>Eight years on, Kroto has a nice line in insouciance: \"These things happen the whole time. It wasn't personal.\" But he can't disguise his resentment at the funding system: not just for the time he has wasted on failed bids and the subsequent hiccups in research, but for the time spent on successful bids. \"None of my three contributions to science has come as a result of anything I've written for a research grant application. They've all come about as spin-off from other work. You can't always plan for everything, and for some research the only person really qualified to judge whether a proposal is worthwhile is the person who has written it.</p> <p>\"The way we distribute research funds needs to be changed. We should give money automatically to those whose last report was good. Money should also go to university departments to fund projects for younger members of staff, and finally some cash should go to those whose last project didn't go so well, providing they also get financial help from industry.\"</p> <p>Kroto realises there's not a hope anyone will take these ideas seriously, but a Nobel prize gives you a certain licence to shoot your mouth off. The bean-counters will continue to obsess about numbers, targets and outcomes, but Kroto is just passionate about the science. Which is why he's devoted so much of the past 10 years to the Vega Science Trust, to producing educational programmes for TV and the net. \"Look,\" he says, clicking through the site. \"Where else can you watch lectures by Richard Feynman and Max Perutz for nothing? Caltech would charge hundreds of dollars for this.\"</p> <p>If part of his motivation is a benevolent desire to instil an enthusiasm for science, you can't help feeling that another large part is exasperation at the public's lack of understanding of the issues. \"Saying that we should stop nanoscience,\" he says, \"is tantamount to saying we should stop science.</p> <p>\"Imagine if we had stopped science in 1904. Yes, there would have been no nerve gas and no Bhopal, but there would also have been no penicillin. All science is a trade-off. It's great to see the bald eagle flying over the Mississippi once more since DDT was banned, but the cost is the deaths from malaria of between 1 and 2 million young children in Africa each year.\"</p> <p>In the US, Kroto's work will focus on applications of C <sub>60 </sub>. \"There has been some interesting work into nanotubes,\" he says, \"but it's been barking up the wrong tree.\" He declines to say what the right tree might be, but no one should bet against him adding to his hat-trick.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sir Harry Kroto</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 64</p> <p><strong>Jobs:</strong> Royal Society research professor, Sussex University; chairman, Vega Science Trust; president, Royal Society of Chemistry; visiting professor at University of California, Santa Barbara</p> <p><strong>Awards:</strong> fellow of Royal Society, 1990; joint Nobel prize for chemistry, 1996; knighted, 1996</p> <p><strong>Publications:</strong> more than 300 papers on chemistry, physics and astronomy</p> <p><strong>Likes:</strong> graphic design</p> <p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> religion</p> <p><strong>Married:</strong> with two sons</p>",
  "Scientists have unveiled a new hi-tech weapon to help combat the illegal trade of ivory in Africa: a map. <p>The map describes how the genetic profiles of African elephants vary across the continent, from the dense forests of western and central Africa to the vast eastern savanna. </p> <p>The team behind the map, headed by Samuel Wasser, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, says it can be used to verify where collections of ivory originated, by allowing police and customs officers to link stocks of tusks to herds known to live in a specific region. </p> <p>It could also help alert officials to the emergence of poaching hotspots, where law enforcement needs to be bolstered. </p> <p>Prof Wasser and his team visited sites in 16 African countries where most of the elephant population roams, and collected DNA from droppings and skin tissue. The DNA was analysed to identify key sequences of genetic code that distinguish one group of elephants from another. </p> <p>Using a computer model, the team was then able to work out the likely genetic make-up of elephants in other parts of Africa and so build up a map of the elephants' genetic diversity. </p> <p>Using the map, officials could ascertain the origin of tusks in national stockpiles or from intercepted consignments by simply taking DNA samples, a procedure that costs around \u00a360, and checking them against the map. The team, whose work appears today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that continent-wide the system could place half of all ivory within 300 miles of its origin, though accuracy varied from region to region, improving to within 84 miles in west Africa. </p> <p>The map could have the biggest impact on poaching in African forests. While elephant numbers are easy to track in the open savannas, populations and poachers are tougher to monitor in the forests. </p> <p>\"My colleagues working in the forests are saying 'there are no elephants left here',\" said Prof Wasser. \"In the forest, you don't notice the change in population until it's so dramatic that it's almost too late to do anything about it.\" </p> <p>The African elephant population dropped by 60% between 1979 and 1987, from 1.3m to 500,000, largely because of ivory poachers. </p> <p>Although an international ban on ivory trading was passed in 1989, the three largest hauls of ivory, one of which amouned to around 6.5 tonnes, have occurred in the past two years. </p> <p>In 2002, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa were granted permission to have one-off sales of legally acquired ivory. Next week, Namibia will petition the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Wild Fauna and Flora to approve an annual quota of raw ivory sales of two tonnes a year. </p> <p>Julian Blanc, of the World Conservation Union's African elephant specialist group in Nairobi, believes the genetic map could one day become a valuable tool in clamping down on the illegal trade of tusks. </p> <p>He said: \"Right now, it's probably not precise enough because it might not tell us if a consignment comes from one side of a national border or the other. But if it can be improved, it would be able to help verify whether ivory has been acquired legally and comes from the region they claim.\"</p>",
  "The South African singer and former beauty queen Dolly Rathebe, who has died aged 76 following a stroke, became Africa's first acknowledged international female actor when she starred in the 1949 British-produced movie, Jim Comes To Jo'burg - the first film to portray urban Africans in a positive light. <p>The producers were looking for a light-skinned woman to play the female lead until Rathebe mesmerised them with her rendition of Salt Lake City Blues. Even though it was not a great financial success, Jim Comes To Jo'burg projected Rathebe into the limelight, and she became known as the South African Billie Holiday and the African Marilyn Monroe. </p> <p>Drum magazine picked her to feature on its front cover in 1957. But when the German photographer Jurgen Schadeberg took Rathebe to a mine dump for the shoot, they were arrested for contravening the Immorality Act, which forbade interracial relationships. Rathebe later became a lead singer with two popular township bands, the Harlem Swingsters and the Inkspots. Such was her beauty that it was said that when men greeted one another, and wanted to stress that all was well, they would say, \"It is Dolly.\" </p> <p>Rathebe was born Jose-phine Kedibone in Randfontein, near Johannesburg. Her father was a migrant labourer and her mother came from a farming family. She attended St Cyrian missionary school in Sophiatown, the only area of Johannesburg where blacks could own freehold property - and a place where whites could go, even though it was against the law, to drink, listen to music and discuss issues with blacks and Indians. This experience had a lasting impression on Rathebe, who never found it difficult to mingle with people across racial divides. </p> <p>Her father, whom she described as the best man she ever met, was often away working in the gold mines, and this led to the breakdown of her parents' marriage. At 15, she became the family breadwinner. She then began a singing career - which led to her auditioning for Jim Comes To Jo'burg. </p> <p>Rathebe, by now the first African female star, fell in love with William Buti Nketle, a notorious Sophiatown gangleader. She soon became a gangster's moll, often at the forefront of battles against rival gangs. </p> <p>With leading roles in Alf Herbert's African Jazz and Variety Show and in Gibson Kente's Sikalo, Rathebe's career continued to blossom, and she became a mentor to up-and-coming artists such as Miriam Makeba, Thandi Klaasen, Dorothy Masuka and Sophie Mgcina. But while other musicians left for exile, Rathebe stayed behind and endured apartheid. </p> <p>Her beloved Sophiatown was finally destroyed in the early 1960s. Rathebe, now the lead singer in the Afro-Jazz group the Elite Swingsters, found it increasingly difficult to perform, especially after an 8pm curfew was imposed. She later moved her family to Cape Town, where she ran a shebeen for many years. </p> <p>The birth of democracy in South Africa brought Rathebe back to the spotlight. She rejoined the Elite Swingsters and performed at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as South Africa's first black president. In 1994, she sang at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony to mark South Africa's return to the Commonwealth. </p> <p>She performed in television shows and films, both in and outside South Africa.
