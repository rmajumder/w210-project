  "<b>\u00b7</b> To Newcastle, first, and a story that just cries out to be fed through the Diary's random Littlejohn generator. Sadly, that contraption is still not operational (we're having some trouble finding enough dead gay asylum seekers to fuel it) - but we'll take a wild punt that Richard would conclude you couldn't make the following up. And so: the Newcastle Evening Chronicle reports that the Liberal Democrats, who took control of the city council in June, have voted to honour their manifesto pledge to cut \u00a3100,000 off the annual \u00a3940,000 budget for senior councillors' allowances. Unfortunately - and here we see the good folk of local government foiled once again - an independent remuneration panel has vetoed the plan, and forbidden the councillors to slash their own pay. The astonished Lib Dems are now examining alternative ways of saving the money, including returning part of their salaries on an informal basis. \"If necessary,\" council leader Peter Arnold tells the paper, \"I'll hand back the money.\" We wish him all the best. <p><b>\u00b7</b> We're most grateful to the CBI, meanwhile, for their press release lamenting standards of literacy and numeracy in school leavers. Acquiring such basic business skills, advises Digby Jones, is \"the 'hear and now' for teenage Britain\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Good heavens. After all this time of being strangers, we've finally made contact with Harry Cummins, the British Council press officer who moonlights as Will Cummins, star Sunday Telegraph columnist and author of such clever rants as \"Muslims are a threat to us all\". Harry is still on paid suspension while the BC investigate his denials - but meanwhile we'll be amazed if our conversation with him doesn't become a set text in interview technique for would-be journalists the world over. Lovely to talk at last, we greet him as he answers the phone. How's tricks? \"Fine,\" says Harry. Good. Now, how long are you planning to spin this one out before you cough to it? \"All this is being investigated by my employers.\" Click, brrr. And thence straight to answerphone. We've provisionally selected something in peach for the Pulitzer party, but any designers wanting to loan us stuff should get their offers in early. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance 1: Jack Straw, on Radio 4, repeatedly referring to \"the Sudan\". It's bad enough tagging along to war behind a rabid imperialist, Jack, but beyond vulgar to start talking like one as well. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Delicious news from Virginia, where the charming Reverend Jerry Falwell is to open a Christian-led law school. Students will be trained to fight causes such as gay rights and abortion, and the course at Jerry's Liberty University has already attracted 61 applicants. The school's website promises lessons will combine \"history, objective reality, morality and common sense\" - and who could quibble, given that Jerry's previous triumphs include identifying one of the Teletubbies as gay and blaming the 9/11 attacks on gays and feminists. Anyway, something to stick on the Ucas form if you're not tempted by David Beckham's LA soccer academy or Madonna's planned Kabbalah college. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Incidentally, does anyone know anyone who actually practises Kabbalah, the celebrity religion du jour, who could get us a free place on the London centre's 10-week introductory course? Apparently it makes sense of literally all human existence - even why you have to spend \u00a3400 on a starter pack of books - and we're keen to take the Diary's black soul a couple of shades lighter this year. We'd give them a weekly mention, they may be sure of that. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance 2: Dame Joan Plowright, at 3.12pm on Monday, shopping in Planet Organic on London's Westbourne Grove. Dame Joan's trolley contained some soya milk and a large watermelon. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "There is a meat market, where haunches of goat hang from the thatched roof. There are tea stalls and shacks selling hair mousse and skin cream. Some women dig vegetable plots while their neighbours shape clay and water with their bare hands to build new houses. <p>An enterprising refugee has even bought a satellite dish and set up a TV tent, where a crowd packs in every night to watch the Arabic news channel, al-Jazeera. </p> <p>The refugee camp at Iridimi, in north-eastern Chad, is home to 15,000 people who have fled the violence in Darfur. They are showing every sign of settling permanently across the border. </p> <p>There is a cross-section of Darfur society in Iridimi; peasant farmers and herders, but also middle-class refugees who are trying to rebuild their businesses. </p> <p>Juma al-Hamdar, 40, borrowed money from family in Libya and the Gulf to buy a generator-powered flour mill, where women queue each day to grind cereals. </p> <p>Sipping black tea, the businessman speaks quietly in English about his six-year-old son Ahmed, who was killed when the Sudanese government bombed the town of Kornoi. \"My baby died by Antonov,\" he said. </p> <p>Here he has a new life and a new child, Salma, who was born in the camp eight days ago. </p> <p>Stallholder Hashim Haroum, 23, who sells pasta, soap and lollipops from a shack made of thatch and tree branches, was a student in Darfur. </p> <p>But he chose to go into business in the camp with the support of a loan from family members who were already settled in Chad. </p> <p>\"If peace comes, I will return. But if not, I will stay here,\" he said. \"Business is good, thank God.\" </p> <p>However, the success of some of the businessmen can be deceptive. </p> <p>Life for the majority of the refugees is cramped and hard in comparison with Darfur - and conditions at Iridimi are better than at most of the other camps in Chad. </p> <p>Some of these are still struggling to provide food, water and shelter for all those who need help. </p> <p>The land in this patch of north-eastern Chad is drier than the fertile soil of their home villages in Darfur. Even in the wet season, less rain falls here. </p> <p>Swathed in a faded purple shawl, Asha Aliya Yahya hacks at the earth in front of her UN-issue tent with a dull knife. </p> <p>In a tiny plot of land no wider than the front of her tent, okra seedlings are sprouting. The sandy soil is stained dark brown with the buckets of water she has poured on it. \"[In Darfur] I had tools to dig the land, but here I have nothing, only this knife,\" Mrs Yahya said. \"This is very hard. </p> <p>\"We had a big garden, growing sorghum, okra, tomatoes and water melon. We had lemons and oranges. We ate the things we grew ourselves and had cows to give us milk and buttermilk.\" </p> <p>In the camp the refugees receive rations of rice, peas, sorghum and a nutritional supplement, corn-soy blend, which is mixed with water to make an unappetising yellow gruel. </p> <p>\"It is not good, because it is not normal food,\" Mrs Yahya said. \"Sometimes it upsets my stomach.\" </p> <p>Like many of the refugees in the camp, she came to Iridimi five months ago after Janjaweed attacked the village of Abu Gumra in north Darfur. </p> <p>When she speaks of the attack, in which two of her sons died, she pulls her shawl over her face so that strangers will not see her tears. </p> <p>Across the camp, refugee women are busy building new homes to replace or extend their UN tents. </p> <p>When it rains, Aziza Hamid Jabar and her children sleep in their tent. But because the tent traps heat, she has built an airy shelter of thick tree branches and plastic sheeting next to it, where she and her children sit out the fierce midday sun. </p> <p>A clay wall with a low doorway curves in a semicircle in front of her living space. Set beside the wall is an open-air kitchen where a cooking fire smoulders. </p> <p>But for her too, life was better in Darfur. \"In Abu Gumra, we had a big wall around the house and many rooms,\" Mrs Jabar said. \"We had a bathroom.\" </p> <p>These are resilient people, whose survival skills have been honed by a tough environment. They are accustomed to lean seasons in which hunger and disease will claim some of their children. </p> <p>But none of them will return to Darfur to face the bomber planes and Janjaweed militias sent by the Sudanese government. </p> <p>There are up to 190,000 refugees in nine camps along the border between western Sudan and Chad. </p> <p>A tenth camp is being built by the UN, which expects many more to cross as the violence continues. </p> <p>Digging at her okra patch, Mrs Yahya said: \"In my country, this would take two months [to yield a crop], but here I don't know because the land is not good. </p> <p>\"This land is dry, but it is better than before because there is no war here, no bombing.\" </p> <p>She added: \"If peace comes, I will return back, but I don't know when that will be. Only God knows.\"</p>",
  "Some towns measure time as a state of constant expansion. In Eden, a mill town in North Carolina's gently rolling hills, life registers in terms of loss: the factories that closed and the jobs that went with them, the lives interrupted. <p>Janice Armstrong lost her job when one of Eden's last giant textile companies closed its gates. After sputtering on for years through cutbacks and down-sizing, the Pillowtex company declared bankruptcy last year, and Ms Armstrong's lifetime of labour, 29 years spent folding and inspecting bedspreads, ended with a brief phone call from her supervisor. It was the only job she has ever had. </p> <p>\"I made a really good living, and I liked my job, and what is so bad is that we have come out with nothing after all those years - no pension, no insurance, no nothing,\" she says. \"The day it closed, our insurance was gone, our pension was gone. It was devastating.\" </p> <p>The shutdown at Pillowtex was the largest single lay-off in North Carolina, with the loss of 4,800 jobs. Since then Ms Armstrong has racked up her share of humiliation: job retraining classes at 52 and, with less than a high school education, having to admit after a lifetime of self-sufficiency that she has no money to get the washing machine repaired, and, on this day, lining up at first light to get a place in line at a food bank run by a local Baptist church. </p> <p>Life does not promise to get any easier. In the last good years at Pillowtex, before the firm cut overtime and pay scales to try to stay afloat, Ms Armstrong took home $13.50 an hour. She supported a stepdaughter and a grandchild, and helped out her aging mother. </p> <p>No one is paying those wages now in Eden. In Greensboro, 40 miles away, she was offered $6 an hour for work in a fast food restaurant. \"That wouldn't cover the price of gas,\" she says. Her unemployment benefit, which is $165 a week, barely covers her mortgage, and runs out in November. Ms Armstrong hopes something will turn up before that. \"The only reason I am surviving is that I have savings,\" she says. </p> <p>Since July 2000 North Carolina has lost 175,900 factory jobs, according to the US bureau of labour. Across the country, America has entered the deepest and longest recession the manufacturing sector has ever known, shedding 2.7 million jobs since early 2001. </p> <p>Fewer Americans now work in manufacturing than at any time since the second world war. For North Carolina the decline has been especially cruel, with more people out of work proportionally than in the heartland of America's heavy industrial belt in the mid-west. A quarter of North Carolina's manufacturing jobs have simply disappeared. </p> <p>Economists say those jobs are unlikely to return because the industries which were North Carolina's speciality - apparel and home furnishings - face intense foreign competition. </p> <p>\"It was painfully obvious,\" says Gordon Allen, the manager of the local branch of the Employment Security Commission. \"We saw companies moving equipment out of their facility and straight to Mexico. Jobs virtually disappeared.\" </p> <p>In his 27 years at the job centre, Mr Allen says these are the hardest times he has ever seen. </p> <p>There has been no mercy for Eden. The town of 16,000 has lost 6-7,000 jobs over the past decade, says mayor Philip Price. Red brick factories on roads named after well-known brands of sheets and towels sit abandoned, with shattered windows on once proud facades. Shops are closed. The clubs where mill managers used to mix are desperate for new members. Attendance at the town's 85 churches is dwindling. </p> <p>And so a town where workers could live well has been relegated to the underclass, where people struggle to find jobs, feed their families and pay for healthcare. </p> <p>John Edwards, a native son who was raised in a mill town 100 miles south of Eden, describes the divide between the haves and the newly created have-nots as the land of \"two Americas\". He has made the gap the central theme of his vice-presidential campaign. </p> <p>Although George Bush won here by a convincing margin in 2000, the Democrats hope to whittle away his lead with Mr Edwards's Carolina credentials and his direct appeal to the dispossessed. </p> <p>In Eden, their ranks are growing. A year ago a retired magistrate, Andrew Collins, set up a food bank at the Hampton Heights church in town. It was a modest undertaking at first; now most weeks he sends 400 people home with cartons of frozen meat, tinned food and bananas. </p> <p>The people on line are young and old, African-American like Ms Armstrong, and white. All say they could not manage without the handout; none feel confident that they will ever find full-time work again. </p> <p>For Maria Coleman, 61, it is simply too late, though she goes to the mandatory two job interviews a week. Thirty-four years ago, when she started at Pillowtex, it did not matter that she had not finished high school and had trouble reading. Now that is the only thing potential employers notice. </p> <p>A few days ago she was offered a place on a course at the local community college - in ice sculpture. Ms Coleman has no illusions it will lead to a job. \"How many people do you know in this area who are going to have the kind of party where they are going to need an ice sculpture?\" she asks. \"The factory got the best years of my life - 34 years. All my life is hell now.\" </p> <p>Mr Price insists that Eden is not lost. A boilermaker from Indiana is taking over one of the abandoned factories; an Israeli manufacturer of baby wipes is thinking of moving to town, attracted by the notion of a cheap and willing workforce. But the Edenites who can are leaving. \"The young people aren't staying here,\" Mr Price says. \"There is a mass exodus of young people with any skills at all.\" </p> <p>Those left behind face diminishing options. After a year or so without work, Jason Anderson has hit the wall. He left school with a ninth grade education to work as a car mechanic. Business fell off when the economy turned, and Mr Anderson lost his job. </p> <p>At 23 he is raising a three-year-old son, Rod. He is no longer with the child's mother, and he says his parents are in no position to help financially. He worked for a time as a house painter, leaving home at 4am to get to jobs, or sleeping overnight on building sites. Then he lost his car and now he is stuck in Eden. \"It doesn't seem like most places are hiring,\" he says. \"It's really hard without an education. There are lots of office jobs, but they all need computers.\" </p> <p>Behind Mr Anderson in the line, 20-year-old Heather Servin is determined not to fall into that trap. The daughter of tobacco share croppers, she made sure she finished high school and has a line on a job as a nursing assistant. </p> <p>It won't pay much at first - less than $8 an hour, though that is more than she earned as a shop assistant. But it is better than her friends are doing, and steadier than her boyfriend's work in the building trade. </p> <p>\"A lot of my friends are trying to get jobs at the factory, but those jobs are not what they used to be,\" she says. In time, she would like to study nursing at the local community college, although there is a two-year waiting list for courses. </p> <p>\"People are always going to need nurses,\" she says.</p>",
  "The alleged mastermind behind the 1980 killing of Archbishop Oscar Romero in El Salvador was due to be tried in his absence in California yesterday on charges of extrajudicial killing and crimes against humanity. <p>An anonymous relative of the archbishop has brought the charges in the hope of winning substantial damages against the man, a former Salvadorean air force captain. </p> <p>Alvaro Rafael Saviria, who until last year was a used-car salesman in Modesto, California, is charged with planning and facilitating the murder of the archbishop as he celebrated mass in San Salvador on March 24 1980. </p> <p>But Mr Saviria, who has lived in the US since at least 1987, is unlikely to be in court. He disappeared after a com plaint was filed against him in September last year. </p> <p>Archbishop Romero was a charismatic and influential figure in the turbulent politics of El Salvador at the end of the 1970s. As an outspoken defender of the rights of the poor and a critic of the rightwing death squads, he was the target of death threats. </p> <p>The UN has estimated that between the late 1970s and 1992, rightwing death squads killed 75,000 civilians in El Salvador. The day before his assassination, Archbishop Romero addressed his sermon to the soldiers involved in the killings. </p> <p>The next day, the lawsuit alleges, Mr Saviria met with the reputed leader of the death squads, Roberto D'Aubuisson. Mr Saviria ordered his driver to take an unknown assassin to the church. The shot that killed the archbishop was allegedly fired from the car, parked 80 to 100 feet away. </p> <p>Mr Saviria then allegedly reported the successful murder to D'Aubuisson and paid the gunman in cash. D'Aubuisson died in 1992. </p> <p>\"This is the first court hearing that's going to examine the personal responsibility of those who planned the assassination,\" said Sandra Coliver, director of the Centre for Justice and Accountablity, which brought the case. </p> <p>Mr Saviria, who is in his 60s, is thought to have initially entered the US on a visitor's visa and stayed in the country when the visa expired. In 1987, he was detained in Miami when Salvadorean prosecutors sought his extradition in connection with the murder of the archbishop. But the extradition request was withdrawn and he was released. </p> <p>In the early 1990s he is thought to have moved from Florida to California, settling in Modesto. He set up a business, the Modesto Auto Mart, but left more than a year ago, leaving a trail of debts and lawsuits. </p> <p>Under a 1993 Salvadorean amnesty he cannot be tried for his part in the killing in his home country. </p> <p>This week's trial will hear testimony from many who were close to the archbishop and to the political situation in El Salvador at the time of his murder, including a former US ambassador, Robert White. </p> <p>Ms Coliver said prosecutors hoped information would emerge in the trial that would lead them closer to the killer. \"We are using this hearing as a step,\" she said.\"We believe there are other people who live here or regularly travel through the US with equal degrees of responsibility.\"</p>",
  "A drug dealer accused of handling half of the illegal drugs smuggled into the US from Mexico has been captured, the Mexican attorney general, Rafael Macedo, said yesterday. <p>Gilberto Higuera Guerrero was arrested on Sunday in the northern city of Mexicali. \"This man's fame is practically one of the legends of drug trafficking,\" said Mr Macedo. </p> <p>A $2m (\u00a31.34m) price had been put on his head by the US drug enforcement agency, which wants to extradite him. </p> <p>Mr Macedo claimed that Mr Higuera Guerrero was behind a cocaine-smuggling gang led by Ismael \"Mayo\" Zambada in the border province of Baja California. </p> <p>\"This man handled 50% of the drugs that crossed the border,\" Mr Macedo claimed, adding that he also ran units of hired gunmen and ordered the killing of rivals. </p> <p>He was allegedly a senior operator in a cartel led by the infamous Arellano Felix family before he switched to the Zambada gang late last year. The defection sparked a string of violent clashes in the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali, the attorney general said. </p> <p>Both cartels have come under intense pressure from the government. Zambada was captured in 2002, and the Arellano Felix cartel has seen many of its leading members arrested during the past three years. </p> <p>The Mexican government said Mr Higuera Guerrero would first face charges in Mexico before any possible extradition to the US.</p>",

  "Par Cher Yang is struggling to decide which two of his three wives to divorce. One is 56 and has borne him seven children, the second is 50 and has also given birth to seven children. The third, 25, has given birth to five. Between them, the 19 children have 19 children of their own. <p>The dilemma facing this 59-year-old Hmong from Laos has not been provoked by jealousy or marital indiscretions, but political expediency. </p> <p>Mr Yang and approximately 15,900 of his fellow Hmong in a refugee camp near the Tham Krabok temple, 90 miles north of Thailand's capital, Bangkok, have been offered resettlement in the US, provided they meet the immigration criteria, one of which is no polygamy. </p> <p>\"I am still thinking about it,\" he said. \"It is not an easy decision because my family is so large and so dear to me.\" </p> <p>He has to make up his mind fast because, after a few families left last month, the resettlement process is gaining momentum. </p> <p>The first charter flight with 289 people on board left Thailand yesterday for Los Angeles, and the Thai government says it wants the camp closed within six months. </p> <p>The excitement is palpable in Tham Krabok, more a town than a camp, where the Hmong congregated after drifting around Thailand for years. </p> <p>Young boys playing football in the dusty lanes dream of a US education leading to untold riches, while the older generation regards the move as the completion of an outstanding 29-year debt. </p> <p>\"The Americans deserted us in 1975,\" Mr Yang said. \"We fought for them for 12 years and then at the end of the war they just left. It really hurt. It's like tears have run down my face ever since and this help now is wiping them away.\" </p> <p>He is referring to the 40,000 Hmong fighters recruited by the CIA to halt the spread of communism in Laos as a sideshow to the Vietnam war. </p> <p>Almost half the fighters were killed, civilian casualties approached 50,000 and, by 1973, nearly half the Hmong population in Laos had been displaced. Thousands more died after the Americans withdrew two years later. </p> <p>The Hmong have been fleeing from persecution for much of the past 250 years. In the late 18th century they fled oppression in China and eventually settled mostly in the north of modern-day Laos. </p> <p>By 1980 more than 100,000 had sought refuge in various camps in Thailand. The move to Tham Krabok began 10 years later, when some sought treatment for drug addiction at the temple and took their families with them. </p> <p>The current resettlement, undertaken by the International Organisation for Migration, is mopping up most of the remaining Hmong refugees in Thailand, because Bangkok has no intention of giving them citizenship. </p> <p>\"We are afraid of a flood [of refugees] if we did [grant citizenship],\" General Winai Phattiyakul, secretary general of Thailand's national security council, told the Guardian. \"The situation is already bad. We've just finished the registration of illegal workers and the number is 1.27 million, and we estimate those still underground are roughly about another million or two.\" </p> <p>In addition to the repayment of histor ical debts, there are two further factors for Washington. One is the Hmong-American lobby, which, at 200,000-strong, is clamouring for its relatives to be allowed in. The other is the desire of the US to maintain its image as a haven. </p> <p>As a result of tighter security measures since the September 11 terrorist attacks, refugee inflows have fallen by almost half. </p> <p>The Hmong in Tham Krabok are considered safe because for the past 18 months they have been living encircled by razor wire and \"protected\" by more than 100 Thai special operations troops. </p> <p>As a result, 99.9% have been cured of any drug addiction they might have had. \"This was one identifiable community,\" a US official said. \"It is like a small village which you don't have elsewhere.\" </p> <p>But life will not be easy for many of Tham Krabok's residents. </p> <p>Sua Vw, 14, is typical. While nursing her month-old son, Ming, she said she was nervous. \"My husband Peng Lao is only 18 and doesn't work, while neither of us have really been to school,\" she said. \"I'm worried about what we will do in America.\" </p> <p><b> Education</b><br> </p> <p>Thanks to Hmong-American volunteer teachers, she has completed her allotted 20 hours of cultural orientation, the book for which includes seemingly basic advice: \"It is illegal to bribe police officers or other public officials\", and concepts alien to the Hmong, such as privacy, punctuality and rights. </p> <p>She will rely on her grandmother, who lives in California, plus the \u00a3800 the government gives to each refugee. \"For the first few years it will be very tough,\" said Kham Moua, a Hmong leader in South Carolina who estimates that about one-third of the Hmong immigrants to America live in poverty. </p> <p>\"They've got to learn the language, how to go to school, how to communicate with others and get a job.\" </p> <p>He did not think many of the Tham Krabok migrants would face hardship for long. \"We now have people who speak English and know the system, unlike in 1976 when I arrived. Then we were all like blind men and many never properly adjusted.\" </p> <p>Back in the camp the anticipation extends to Pang Yicher, who reckons he is \"about 90\". </p> <p>\"I'm old and I've fought a lot, so I don't fear anything and just take life as it comes,\" he said on his way home from his pre-departure medical examination. \"I'm really looking forward to studying English, but it could be quite difficult.\"</p>",
  "Secular as well as Islamic anti-occupation forces in Iraq are now beginning to drop their caution about Moqtada al-Sadr and are openly siding with his resistance forces in Najaf. The National Foundation Congress, the influential umbrella organisation that represents most religious, nationalist and other secular forces opposed to the US-led occupation, on Saturday issued an eight-point proposal, already approved by Sadr, to peacefully end the crisis in Najaf. This proposal strengthens Sadr's hand and is in essence a call to end the US-led forces' carnage in Najaf and Baghdad and all other areas of Iraq. <p>But as intense fighting continues around the Imam Ali shrine, where Sadr's fighters have resisted more than two weeks of US bombardment, it's worth taking a closer look at the man himself. There is much more to Sadr than meets the eye. </p> <p>His full title is Hujjat il-Isalm al-Sayyid Moqtada Muhammad Sadeq al-Sadr, and he is 31 years old. Al-Sayyid literally translates to mister, but when conferred by clerics, as in this case, it is public recognition that the man concerned can authentically trace his lineage to the Prophet Muhammad. </p> <p>Muhammad Sadeq is his father's name. Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Sadeq al-Sadr was murdered in 1999 by Saddam, because he was building bridges with Sunni clerics and becoming influential among the poor, particularly in the 2-million strong poorest district of Baghdad now known as Sadr City. His uncle Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr was an even more politically significant figure: he and his sister Bint-ul-Huda were tortured to death by Saddam's thugs in 1980. The pair had founded a powerful militant movement that was at the forefront of the Islamic wing of the opposition to Saddam's regime. It is reported that Saddam himself shot both of them after their torture. </p> <p>Sadr often reminds his listeners of this illustrious heritage, including active involvement in the 1920 revolution against British occupation. Like his father, he often wears a white robe on top of his religious garb to indicate that he too is ready to be \"a martyr in the cause of liberation and independence\". When the US-led occupation forces sought to capture him \"dead or alive\" in April, he chose to resist rather than surrender. </p> <p>No matter how young and politically inexperienced they were told that he was, the militant patriots of Sadr City, Najaf, Basra and beyond began to trust him and saw in him the rightful custodian of the traditions handed down by the rebellious Islamic leaders who chose martyrdom rather than obeying tyranny. Indeed, Saddam's regime finally began to totter, despite the murderous US-led 13 years of sanctions that strengthened him and hurt the people, precisely because this uncompromising will to be free and resist subjugation runs very deep in Iraq. </p> <p>It is said that Iraq's Shia strictly follow their most senior religious leaders. This might be true of practising Shia in calmer times. But in times of crises this readiness to listen to \"wiser\" councils evaporates. Grand Ayatollah Sistani was being listened to attentively after the invasion. The number of his portraits on display was rising with every defiant statement. During the past few weeks, however, those portraits were fast disappearing to be replaced by Sadr's, and those of his father, his uncle, Ayatollah Khomeini, and those of another very potent and very popular junior, Nasrallah, leader of Hizbullah in Lebanon. </p> <p>There are now signs that, like Nasrallah in Lebanon, Sadr is learning that he needs to build bridges and links with Iraq's varied sects, religions, nationalities and secular political trends. After Iraq's proconsul Paul Bremer appointed the now defunct Iraqi Governing Council last year, Sadr uni laterally declared the appointment of an alternative government composed solely of his supporters. It went down like a lead balloon. However, when asked last week about the political and social programme of al-Tayyar al-Sadri's (the Sadri current), one of Sadr's main spokesmen said that Sadr opposed the publication of such a detailed programme because it had to evolve from and be agreed at a conference of all Iraq's political forces.

  "The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, today urged the Sudanese government to bring an end to the continuing atrocities taking place in the Darfur region. <p>Mr Straw called on the government to lift the fear keeping more than one million refugees from returning to their homes. </p> <p>Following talks with Sudan's president, Lieutenant General Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, he told journalists he had asked Mr al-Bashir to work with the international community to end the refugees' suffering. </p> <p>Speaking at a press conference at the British embassy, he said: \"The interests of the international community are the same as those of the president and government of Sudan - which is that our collective interest is to see a safe, secure and prosperous Sudan, able to live at peace with itself amongst all its states and many tribes. </p> <p>\"But I also said to the president that the government of Sudan had to help us to help them, and that meant fulfilling the obligations imposed on them by UN and voluntarily accepted by them. </p> <p>\"The last thing we want to be in the international community is in conflict with the government of Sudan, but we do have very clear responsibilities to the UN charter to ensure that this kind of humanitarian disaster is averted.\" </p> <p>Mr Straw, who earlier today visited a refugee camp, said it was clear the refugees were too frightened to return to their homes because of continuing attacks by the Janjaweed militia. </p> <p>\"I spoke to many of the refugees in the camp and got from them a sense of their fear as a result of what had happened to them and their families, the killings they had witnessed, and their concern about whether or not they would be able to return to their homes,\" he said. </p> <p>The foreign secretary revealed he had also spoken to members of the African Union monitoring mission to Darfur. </p> <p>\"What I understand is that there has not been aerial bombardment since the end of June, that the ceasefire, as a formal ceasefire, is broadly holding, but that atrocities have continued,\" Mr Straw said. </p> <p>He also spoke to Jan Pronk, the UN's special representative in Sudan, whose assessment of the Sudanese government's efforts to comply with demands on helping the refugees will be formally discussed by the security council at the end of next week. </p> <p>Earlier today, the foreign secretary flew from Khartoum to the Abu Shouk refugee camp, in northern Darfur, to gain first-hand experience of the inmates' plight. </p> <p>He spent more than an hour touring the camp, which is a collection of 8,000 plastic sheet huts providing temporary homes to around 57,000 people near the town of El Fasher. </p> <p>While visiting the camp's school, its feeding centre and water distribution point, he was warmly welcomed by the refugees, who seemed encouraged that a senior foreign politician was giving attention to their problems. </p> <p>Asked about his abiding impression of the camp, Mr Straw said: \"Above all is the scale of the problem. I knew the numbers. But it is one thing to know the numbers - it is quite another to come here, to survey this camp, and to realise that there are more than 50,000 people in this camp. That is less than a 20th the people displaced as a result of this conflict in Darfur.\" </p> <p>The foreign secretary expressed satisfaction at signs the Sudanese government was making some progress on improving access to Darfur for humanitarian organisations and improving security within the perimeters of the estimated 147 refugee camps in the region. </p> <p>However, he stressed that Khartoum still had much to do to improving security around the camps. </p> <p>\"There is a very great deal to be done before these people and 1.2 million like them feel reassured enough to go back to the villages from which they have come,\" he said. \"That requires a real effort by the government of Sudan to provide for their security.\" </p> <p>One senior British official who has worked in western Darfur said that, having used extreme violence to force the refugees into the camps, the Janjaweed militia were now using lower level - but still significant - violence to pen them in. This left militiamen to do as they pleased on the refugees' former lands. </p> <p>\"My assessment is that this is bandit country in which the Janjaweed are doing what they want, where they want, when they want,\" the official said. </p> <p>Mr Straw was asked whether he was in a position to give the Sudanese government a clean bill of health. </p> <p>\"I am not here to do that,\" he said. \"It will be UN secretary general Kofi Annan's report to the security council at the end of this week which will be crucial in determining whether the government of Sudan has done enough to meet the obligations imposed on it by the resolution passed at the end of last month.\" </p> <p>The UK was a co-sponsor of security council resolution 1556, which demands that Sudan's government creates safe havens for the refugees. It also requires a halt to be brought to military operations by government forces, militias and rebel groups within the havens. </p> <p>The resolution gives the Sudanese government until August 30 to comply or face further measures. </p> <p>Mr Straw said the international community needed Sudan's co-operation in its efforts to help the refugees. \"In a country which is the size of Europe, in a region the size of France, there are plainly practical limits to what the international community can do by itself without at least the acquiescence, and we hope the consent, of the resident government,\" he added. </p> <p>Abu Shouk is regarded as probably the best organised and best run camp in Darfur. Aid workers have said that conditions in other camps were far more desperate. </p> <p>\"I am aware that this is one of the best camps,\" Mr Straw said. \"I don't want to suggest that it is typical.\"</p>",
  "Applications for asylum in the UK fell by 13% during April, May and June, according to new Home Office figures released today. <p>The quarterly figures show that new applications, including dependants, totalled 9,210 - while the figure excluding dependants dropped to 7,920, a 26% reduction on the same period last year.</p> <p>The publication of the figures, in one of the most highly charged areas of government policy, is always a cause of controversy, with the Conservatives branding the figures \"meaningless\" and the government's approach \"chaotic and inefficient\" even before the numbers were announced.</p> <p>Applications reached a peak in 2002, with nearly 25,000 claims per quarter, and have been a political hot potato for most of the past decade, with the tabloid press often splashing on the issue several days a week.</p> <p>Today the immigration and asylum minister, Des Browne, credited part of the reduction to the installation of UK immigration officials in France and Belgium. He also attacked the opposition for taking up the official figures when they showed an increase, and dismissing them as \"unreliable\" when they showed a fall.</p> <p><b>Breakdown of figures</b><br></p> <p>A breakdown of today's figures shows that Iran is now the most common country of origin, with 685 applications. Somalia was knocked into third place with 540 applications, below China's 595. Applications from Iraq increased by 20% to 410.</p> <p>The number of failed asylum seekers being deported from the UK was also significantly reduced. Including dependants, 3,725 were removed from Britain - 9% fewer than in the previous three months and 18% fewer than in the same period last year. </p> <p>The Home Office report said the fall in removals was \"due to a large extent to fewer removals of nationals of the 10 countries which joined the EU on May 1\".</p> <p>Of the 11,720 initial decisions made on asylum applications, 3% (355) were granted asylum, 7% (855) were granted discretionary leave to remain in the UK, 40 (0.34%) were granted humanitarian protection and 89% (10,470) were refused. </p> <p>The independent Immigration Appellate Authority received 11,970 appeals in the period. Of those, 2,755 appeals were allowed - 20% down from 22% the previous quarter.</p> <p>Revised asylum figures for 2003 showed applications excluding dependants fell by 41% to 49,405, with an estimated 28% being awarded asylum, leave to remain or humanitarian protection, or winning on appeal.</p> <p><b>'Chaotic and shambolic'</b></p> <p>Conservative home affairs spokesman Humfrey Malins said that a small fall in the asylum figures was meaningless. </p> <p>\"This government has had a chaotic and shambolic policy for the last few years. They are hopelessly inefficient,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>\"If there are fewer asylum applications in the last quarter, most people believe that that could mean greater numbers of people are still entering the country illegally, because our borders are not secure, and simply not bothering to claim asylum.\"</p> <p>But Mr Browne - who took over what David Blunkett described as the most difficult job outside the cabinet in April after the resignation of Beverley Hughes - said: \"When these asylum figures, prepared in exactly the same way by exactly the same officials and published in exactly the same way, showed about 18 months ago historically high figures of asylum seekers, they [the Tories] were happy to rely upon them.</p> <p>\"Now that they are dropping significantly, and have been over the last 18 months, they are no longer reliable figures. Isn't that surprising?\"</p> <p>He later added: \"We will shortly be implementing the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004 which makes it an offence to arrive without papers or to fail to cooperate with re-documentation and which will speed up the appeals process. </p> <p>\"These will start to bite - just as our previous legislation has made a difference - making it easier for us to remove people who have no legitimate right to be in this country.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats said that an obsession with numbers was \"wrong\", since a disaster in Iraq or Somalia should mean an increase in asylum numbers.</p> <p>Their home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said: \"If there was a disaster in Somalia or Iraq, surely we would want to see an increase because it would mean that we were taking people who were fleeing persecution.</p> <p>\"So having this kind of fall may be absolutely meaningless because it could actually be a result of poor information [and] bad decisions being taken.\"</p> <p><b>Charity reaction</b><br></p> <p>Asylum charities pointed out that despite the fall in numbers there was no indication that the world had become safer, with the figures coming as the humanitarian situation in Sudan caused international concern.</p> <p>The number of applications for asylum in the UK from Sudanese nationals dropped by 30% to only 265 in the first quarter of this year, the Refugee Council's deputy chief executive, Margaret Lally, said.</p> <p>\"The government must turn its attention to what really matters - its responsibility to provide protection to those who need our help,\" she said.</p> <p>The chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Habib Rahman, said: \"The UK's increasingly harsh asylum system, which includes imprisonment of asylum seekers and forcible deportations, may be responsible for driving many asylum seekers underground if they manage to reach this country.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The fact that millions of people worldwide continue to suffer under repressive regimes, yet do not claim asylum in the UK, is not necessarily a cause for celebration.\"</p> <p> In all, 70,600 asylum seekers were receiving welfare payments or accommodation at the end of the period, according to the figures - 7% down on the previous three months and 22% down period-on-period.</p> <p>It was the Home Office's calculation of these two sets of figures - removals and numbers being supported - which came in for the most serious criticism in a National Audit Office report in May.</p> <p>The spending watchdogs said the totals had missed out up to 24,000 asylum seekers receiving welfare and accommodation funding, and that there was no evidence to confirm that removals from the UK had actually taken place in 6% of 48 cases analysed. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Separate figures published today showed 139,675 immigrants were granted leave to stay in the UK during 2003, 20% more than in the previous year. </p> <p>The figure included 29,600 people given employment-related grants, a rise of 50%, and 65,800 allowed to stay on family grounds, up 25%. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary accused the government of handing out work permits \"like confetti\" to meet Mr Blair's public targets on asylum. David Davis said: \"It's astonishing that we are removing fewer failed asylum seekers than before, when there are tens of thousands of people who shouldn't be here. </p> <p>\"Hidden in these figures are tens of thousands of people who would never have been allowed to stay before. </p> <p>\"That's why Britain has a reputation as a soft touch, and that's why a new Sangatte is opening up a mile down the road from the old one.\" </p> <p>\"These figures have become utterly discredited. The government have fiddled everything to meet Tony Blair's target on asylum, even if that means ignoring illegal immigrants and handing out work permits like confetti.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> By the way, for further coverage please <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/olympics2004/story/0,14912,1289901,00.html\">click here</a>.</p> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> That's me done. Thanks for all your emails - and best of luck to Dean Macey in his final two events. </p> <p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> Newton has retired. 65 laps left. </p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Our medal hope, Chris Newton, is apparently \"splintering under the pressure\". Oh dear. Russian Ignatyev is leading, German Guido Fulst is second. </p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Right. There's 80 laps to go. Milton Wynants of Uruguay leads. I think. </p> <p><strong>3.44pm:</strong> Meanwhile, Neil Golightly has an idea. \"In the modern pentathlon, the final event (cross country) has a staggered start, with the points leader going first and everyone else going at intervals according to how many points behind they are. This means that the winner actually is the person who crosses the finish line first. Wouldn't this liven up the decathlon no end?\". </p> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Small technical hitch, but we're back. At the velodrome, the men's points race final is in progress. We're a quarter of the way through - still over 100 laps to go. </p> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> All becomes clear. The Swiss success on the beach volleyball court is apparently down to the fact that \"every half a year or so they fill Zurich train station with sand and pretend it's a beach\". You can almost hear those Hollywood scriptwriters sharpening their pencils. Or not. </p> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> Just to recap. Dean Macey's best attempt in the pole vault, the eighth decathlon event, saw him clear 4.40m but fail three attempts at 4.60m. That leaves him needing a superhuman effort in the javelin and the 1500m to catch Amercian Bryan Clay, who is 341 points ahead in the bronze position. The javelin starts at 5.30pm</p> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> Craig Doyle seems to have quite a fanclub. \"Hey, that 'fella from the Holiday programme' is the reason why so many women are enjoying the Beeb's coverage of the Olympics. He even has the ice maiden Ms Balding blushing and giggling under that fringe of hers. Nothing wrong with the BBC's coverage as far as I'm concerned. Bring on more eye candy for the ladeez,\" says Katie, who seems to have been taking spelling lessons from Noddy Holder. </p> <p><strong>3.16pm:</strong> Russian Tamilla Abassova has won the second, all-Russian semi final, to win the chance to race Muenzer in the final (he says, desperately trying to keep up with these races - which last roughly 12 seconds each). </p> <p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> \"The BBC coverage has been saved by two things,\" reckons Paul. \"Firstly Michael Johnson is the god of pundits and, secondly, the bloke who does the voiceovers for the event descriptions has decided that Alan Partridge should be his role model.\" Who is that?</p> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Lori Ann Muenzer takes it to reach the final and guarantee at least a silver. </p> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Canadian Lori Ann Muenzer is taking on Australian Anna Meares in the deciding heat of their sprint semi final. Cat and mouse stuff, this sprint cycling, as they battle for the inside berth.</p> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> In the meantime, there's some reasonably pointless sprints on the cycle track to decide who finishes where outside the medal positions. </p> <p><strong>3.02pm:</strong> Everybody, it seems, has an opinion on the BBC's coverage. Catherine reckons Craig Doyle is not doing a bad job. \"Certainly not as smarmy as on his recent Irish talk show. He does appear to have switched allegiances somewhere along the way, though, and keeps referring to \"us\" and \"we\" when talking about the British... Oi, Doyler, you're not Terry Wogan on the Eurovision, you know.\" Quite.</p> <p><strong>3.02pm:</strong>In the other semi-final 21-year-old Dutchman Theo Bos has won 2-0, so he's through to the final later today against Bailey. </p> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> \"Cool Runnings? Great film\" writes David, who is embarrassing himself. </p> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Great finish as Bailey wins with a sprint finish to defeat reigning champ Gane and reach the final. </p> <p><strong>2.56pm:</strong> It's 1-1 in both women's semi finals. Now it's Australian Ryan Bailey against Frenchman Laurent Gane in the men's. Bailey is 1 race up. Best of three.</p> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Over to the velodrome, where the women's sprint semi-finals are in progress... </p> <p><strong>2.51pm:</strong> Daniel has emailed from a well known high street bank (with a black horse for a logo) to say: \"In response to Jonathan Keith's query. Cheques take five days to go through because we need time to write into the Guardian's Olympic coverage.\" And the rest of the year?</p> <p><strong>2.50pm:</strong> Franco says he's \"glad to see the Swiss made it into the semi-finals of the beach volleyball. Given the lack of coastline, are they this year's Jamaican bobsledders?\" Maybe, though if it means sitting through another film of the calibre of Cool Runnings, is it anything to celebrate?</p> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> On the bright side, Simon Hiscocks and Chris Draper have guaranteed Team GB their fourth sailing medal in the mixed 49er category. The British pair finished the day in third place overall and, with just one race remaining, cannot be caught by America, who are currently fourth. While they're unlikely to catch Spain following the final race on Thursday, they stand a definite chance of silver with the Ukraine only two points ahead in second place. Where would we be without the sailing?</p> <p><strong>2.41pm:</strong> You can put your calculators away. Macey's failure at his third attempt means the gap between Macey and Clay has been stretched out to 341 points. Effectively that leaves Macey needing an injury to his rival in the final two events to have a hope of snatching bronze. </p> <p><strong>2.38pm:</strong> \"To get back to the jack of all trades v master of none discussion,\" writes Jonathan Cardy. Go on then. \"Daley Thomson was on the telly last night over here in Germany and after trying to snog Katarina Witt he very casually mentioned that his best time for 100 meters was 10.26 seconds. That might not have earned him a medal the other night - but by my reckoning it makes him quicker than any of our current 100 meter sprinters and better than most others who specialise in this event.\" </p> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Apparently we've missed an earthquake in the BBC studio. So says Ms Balding. To continue the theme from earlier today - what do we think of the Beeb's coverage so far?Do we agree with Labour MP Chris Bryant and the Sunday Times that it's smug and banal. Or are Balding, Cram, Rider and that fella from the Holiday programme doing a decent job?</p> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> The Brazilians have beaten the Swiss to reach the final of the men's beach volleyball, where they will meet Spain. </p> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> Jonathan Keith is not a happy man. \"Absolutely nothing to do with the Olympics (unless the swine are squandering more of my money on sponsorship, which they probably are), but how can a bank take five working days to clear a cheque in 2004? Maybe some of your readers can cast some light on the matter for me?\" Anyone? </p> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> Come on Dean! No...he's gone straight into the bar. Having passed at 4.50m, that leaves 4.40m as his best attempt. Let's hope he's saving himself for the javelin... </p> <p><strong>2.15pm:</strong> So, Macey has one attempt left at 4.60m. The pressure's on, particularly as some of his rivals for that bronze medal are now going clear at 5.00m. </p> <p><strong>2.10pm:</strong> Dean Macey has just failed his second attempt at 4.60m. He doesn't look happy and his medal hopes could be dwindling...</p> <p><strong>2.05pm:</strong> Hello, Owen Gibson here, as the baton is passed once more. The USA's Bryan Clay has just failed his final attempt at 5m in the decathlon pole vault</p> <p><strong>2pm:</strong> Dean Macey has appeared. Sadly he failed at 4.60m, but he has two more attempts. Roman Sebrle, in second place, has just cleared 4.90m. </p> <p>Jack Whibley wants to know: \"What's more important: success with women or getting mentions on the Guardian's 'Olympics: as it happens' site?\" Stick to the latter, Jack. Anyway, I'm off again.</p> <p><strong>1.52pm: </strong> Tom Pappas, who was in fifth position, has withdrawn from the decathlon after injuring his foot in the pole vault. Tough on the American, but a plus for Dean Macey's medal hopes. Maybe one day Macey will actually return to action in the pole vault. Just maybe.</p> <p>\"Seeing as you're quiet on the email front,\" starts Rob Mansfield tentatively, \"here's my tenuous link to one of this year's Olympic athletes. My mum is best friends with the mum of sailor Simon Hiscocks.\" Good, Rob, but no cigar. My girlfriend's mum is best friends with Sir Steve Redgrave's wife. Ha! Anyway, you had another point I believe. \"On the nerdy question front: I wonder if there's evidence to suggest that host nations always exceed expectations when it comes to performances and medals at Olympics. The Greeks definitely seem to be doing pretty well this year.\" Let's see. Obviously Australia did well in 2000, but then again they always do well. Ditto America in 1996. But, possible evidence in 1992 is that the Spaniards, who hitherto had won few gold medals, won a big bucket of them in Barcelona. I was only seven when the Games were in Seoul, so my memory does not stretch back that far.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Robbie McMillan has not quite entered the Olympic spirit: \"Synchronised swimming is up there with that skiing-walking thing which goes on forever and horses moving diagonally across loads of wood chippings.\" He has a point though. Still nothing to report.</p> <p><strong>1.39pm:</strong> Bryan Clay has just vaulted over 4.90pm, impressive by anyone's standards. Well, except Sergie Bubka's. Eurosport seem determined not to let me watch Dean Macey.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Colin Parselle has angered me. \"I've just been catching-up, and noticed that Australia beat Japan 1-0 in baseball,\" he says, with my ears pricking up because of my interest in baseball. \"Since when did baseball become an Olympic sport? Could you check how our plucky guys and girls are getting on with Olympic rounders, French cricket and bowls?\" Oh dear. Colin, baseball has been an Olympic sport for some time, it has retained its amateur(ish) status because the Major League players are not allowed/wouldn't want to compete, and has a far higher participation level in lots of countries than it does here. The real question should be how the Aussies have managed to beat Japan. They are the best at everything they turn their hand to, aren't they?</p> <p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> China have beaten their bitter rivals Japan by three games to nil in the quarter-final of the women's volleyball.</p> <p>Gary Partington has relieved my boredom: \"Not strictly related to the Olympics,\" ah, who cares, go on, continue, \"but out around Leeds city centre on my lunch break just now I passed the great Chris Kamara, apparently on a shopping trip with his other half. He'd been asked to pose for a snap with a (female) fan, and he didn't seem at all happy about it.\" Fascinating.</p> <p><strong>1.28pm:</strong> The synchronised swimming (yes, I have plunged this low) second stage is about to start. Russia lead Japan and the United States after the first day, having performed quite impeccably at periscope depth, in a special Athens pool. Oh, and they had the best carnival masks. So say the 14 judges poolside. There cannot be a sport where there are more judges, surely?</p> <p><strong>1.22pm:</strong> Dmitri Karpov has just cleared 4.50m in the pole vault. The Kazahkstan athlete leads the decathlon after seven events.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> It's quiet on the Olympics front and the emails front. Having just sat down at the computer, I can tell you that sailors Simon Hiscocks and Chris Draper are second in the mixed 49er after 14 races. Spain lead by nine points. The British duo finished sixth this morning. The pole vault is continuing, but no further sign of Dean Macey yet.</p> <p><strong>1.07pm</strong> Right, it's time for lunch. I'll hand you over to Mike Adamson.</p> <p><strong>1.05pm</strong> One of Dean Macey's close rivals in the decathlon Tom Pappas is in trouble in the polevault. His first attempt ended with him hobbling straight into the mat and he has been studying his left foot with a look of real concern. At the moment he is yet to register a score in this event, and that would mean the end of his competition. He currently lies fifth, one place behind Macey.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> Dean Macey easily clears his first vault in the polevault at 4.40m. A bronze medal is not out of the question yet. The javelin starts at 5.30pm, with the 1500m - the final event in the decathlon - taking place at 9.05pm. Come on Dean!</p> <p>\"Obadele Thompson? Pah!\" scoffs Charlie Tinsley. \"What about Anju Bobby George, the Indian long jumper? Her parents were clearly big fans of the Essex darts player.\"</p> <p><strong>12.55pm</strong> I mentioned earlier that Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell had moved up to seventh in the Star class after six races with a third place today. The good news is that there are still five races to go for them to move into the medal places.</p> <p>\"Don't you 'vault' in the pole vault and not jump?\" wonders Robert Kovacs. \"Jumping is in the long or triple jump.\" I suppose you probably do, Robert. I suppose you probably do.</p> <p><strong>12.52pm</strong> Marcus Thorpe has a highly scientific explanation for the Rulon Gardner middle-toe frostbite mystery. \"Frostbite is caused by a combination of extreme cold and poor circulation,\" he begins calmly. \"If you try wiggling your toes, which physically moves least? The middle one. Ergo, most likely to be frost-bitten.\" Brilliant! And so simple. </p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> \"<a href=\"http://www.flatbatteries.dsl.pipex.com/games/images/daley2.gif\">This</a> is what Daley meant to an entire generation,\" reckons Jonathan Keith. </p> <p><strong>12.47pm</strong> Things have gone a little quiet in Athens at the moment, so you'll have to make do with this mini-rant from Nigel Wilson.</p> <p>\"Superstars winner and acknowledged fit bloke Brain Hooper presented a 15-minute Channel 4 programme at the end of which he declared water polo the toughest sport he'd ever taken part in. Why don't we get to see any coverage of this (even on interactive)? Just because we invented the game but now play it worse than everyone we taught it to does that mean we shouldn't be entitled to proper coverage (see also tennis, football, and the rest)?\"</p> <p><strong>12.39pm</strong> In the men's star (keelboat), Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell have finished third in race 6, which leaves them seventh overall. But that's just three points behind the Canadians in second place, so there's everything to sail for. Dean Macey is yet to jump in the pole vault.</p> <p>Ed Mack wants to know how the American wrestler Rulon Gardner lost his middle toe to frostbite. \"Wouldn't you expect the flanking toes to have keep it warm and for him to have lost either the big or the (relatively) little toe?\"</p> <p><strong>12.34pm</strong> The pole vault is currently taking place in the decathlon, but no news yet of Dean Macey's progress. You can't get the staff.</p> <p>\"Just to extend James Paterson's point,\" writes Alex Aspinall, \"surely not many other atheletes can claim to have had another athelete named after their sprinting sucess (Obedele Thompson).\"</p> <p><strong>12.29pm</strong> Australia have beaten Japan 1-0 in the semi-finals of the baseball. </p> <p>\"There's also a Daley Thompson House in Notting Hill,\" points out Justin Toland. \"A nice tribute, but where's his knighthood?\" </p> <p><strong>12.24pm</strong> Apparently, I called Christian Malcolm Malcolm Christie earlier. Hilarious though all the jokes are about the Middlesbrough footballer suddenly changing careers, I'd like to put the record straight.</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> \"Perhaps not athletes per say, but 'Sir Tom Finney Way' in Preston is bisected by 'Flintoff Way' upon which a new Sainsburys stands,\" says Dan Musson. \"They do decent pies apparently.\" I think we might be getting off the subject here.</p> <p><strong>12.18pm</strong> \"Daley Thompson came top in a Channel 4 programme about nine years ago to find the greatest ever British Sportsman, beating the likes of Botham, Charlton, Moore etc,\" said Matthew Round. \"As the credits rolled on the last programme my eye caught the credits where it said Executive Consultant: Daley Thompson. No ego whatsoever, that man.\" </p> <p><strong>12.10pm</strong> Sailing, and Simon Hiscocks and Chris Draper have moved to within two points of the overall lead in the 49er class with a narrow win in race 13. The leaders Spain finished eighth.</p> <p>\"Is it me or is there is a self-satisfied air of smugness in all the BBC Sports coverage these days?\" wonders Andrew Goldsby. \"I'm sure they didn't used to be that pleased with themselves all the time and they really don't seem to have learnt the lesson from the way they lost the cricket to Channel 4.\" </p> <p><strong>12.05pm</strong> \"Very few other British athletes can claim to have had the all round success of Daley Thompson,\" pronounces James Peterson, \"and even fewer can claim to have roads named after them. I live a couple of roads down from <a href=\"http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=528808&amp;y=175942&amp;z=1&amp;sv=daley&amp;st=6&amp;tl=Daley+Thompson+Way,+London,+SW8&amp;searchp=newsearch.srf&amp;mapp=newmap.srf\">Daley Thompson way</a>. The more observant will also notice that this leads onto Tessa Sanderson place, metres from my local \"Kelly\" Holmes Place).</p> <p><strong>12.02pm</strong> Just to round up the results so far today from Team GB... Darren Campbell and Malcolm Christie qualify for tonight's second round of the 200m, but Campbell left the stadium rubbing his right leg... But Chris Lambert failed to finish his heat after pulling a hamstring... Rob Newton and Andy Turner didn't make it through to the second round of the 110m hurdles... Dean Macey was fourth going into the pole vault, the eighth event in the decathlon - but he has a lot of work to do to catch up with the USA's Bryan Clay, who currently has a hold on bronze... Ian Wynne (K1 500m), Paul Darby Dowman (K2 1,000m) and Kay Hardy (K1 500m) all qualified for the semi-finals in the canoeing... Nick Skelton is 13th and well-placed to make the final of the individual show-jumping... Robert Smith is 28th... Tony Ally and Mark Shipman are out of the 3m springboard </p> <p><strong>11.48am</strong> \"Can you stop all the gassing and get on with telling us how Deano's doing?\" barks Stephen Torsi. Believe me, Stephen, as soon as I find out, you will be among the first few thousand to know. </p> <p><strong>11.45am</strong> \"Has anyone noticed that the BBC change their commentary for the highlights?\" wonders Daniel Seppings. \"Thus removing the possibility of Colemanballs. The Bryan Clay shot putt from yesterday is a case in point.\"</p> <p><strong>11.42am</strong> Bad news for the Brits in the 3m springboard semi-final. Out of 18 competitors, Tony Ally came 15th and Mark Shipman 18th.</p> <p>\"I don't hear anybody complaining when gymnasts compete in their strongest discipline as well as the the medley (or whatever it's called when they do have a go at all the apparatus in the gym),\" argues Ezra Kirk. \"Also shouldn't the essay be: \"Decathletes. Jack of all trades but master of none, or great all-round competitors. Discus.\" Very nice, Ezra. And in no way lowering the tone. </p> <p><strong>11.39am</strong> No tittering at the back now, but America's reigning Olympic champion in the 120kg Graeco-Roman wrestling Rulon Gardner has won his first two bouts this morning. Gardner has four toes, incidentally, after suffering frostbite when his snowmobile broke down in a Wyoming forest two years ago. Yes, we bring you the human-angle stories too!</p> <p>\"Also, Daley was good enough to compete in team GB's 4x100 relay team,\" points out Harry Wallop.</p> <p><strong>11.32am</strong> Speaking of the individual show-jumping competition, Nick Skelton lies 11th after today's second qualifying round, with Robert Smith back in 28th. </p> <p>\"I recently spent a fortnight in Budapest,\" reveals Gordon Pittendrigh, \"and while no Hungarians I met mentioned the \"Pool of Blood\" final, many of them tried to sell me paprika. How soon they forget.\" Sad, isn't it, Gordon.</p> <p><strong>11.28am</strong> Germany lead the way after the first round of the team show-jumping competition. USA and the Netherlands share second, but a brief scan of the 16 teams reveals that Britain don't actually have one. After much fevered speculation in the office, it is decided that we only have competitors in the individual competition - Nick Skelton and Robert Smith.</p> <p><strong>11.20am</strong> \"Don't you think that events where judges' opinions decide the winner are fundamentally flawed?\" asks Stephen. \"There needs to be some clear winner/loser decider. I recommend merging high diving and greco-roman wrestling or gymnastics and team pursuit cycling. Then we'll know who's boss.\"</p> <p><strong>11.16am</strong> Sarah Hannett is still wincing with the embarrassment of it all. \"The truly cringe-worthy moment of Brendan Foster singing the Batman theme tune as the Hungarian discus gold and bronze winner ran a lap of honour under the Hugarian flag 'cape',\" she says. \"Awful.\"</p> <p><strong>11.12am</strong> Ian Wynne has won Heat 2 in the K-1 500m. Quite where this leaves him overall is anyone's guess.</p> <p>\"Just to chip in on the jack of all trades or good all around athletes debate,\" writes Paul Robson, \"I think I'm right in saying that while the jack of all trades normally applies, in his heyday Daley Thompson's long jump would've won him a medal in the individaul long jump event had he competed (it was certainly no worse that 4th).\" </p> <p><strong>11.05am</strong>The big grudge match in the women's basketball has been won by China, who have beaten Japan 82-63 in the prestigious 9th-10th place play-off.</p> <p>Alex Walter has another amusing quote. \"'That jump was just like the last one - he flew over the bar' - Paul Dickinson commenting on Deano in the high jump last night. It was in fact a replay.\"</p> <p><strong>11.01am</strong> \"Has anyone else noticed that the BBC's gymnastics commentators managed to get their predictions of how the judges would score each performance completely wrong on just about every occasion,\" wonders Dominic Jones. \"Were they trying to push some sort of conspiracy theory on us, or are they perhaps as crap at identifying good gymnastic skills as GB gymnasts are at producing them?\" </p> <p>To be fair, Dominic, it sounds as if everyone got their predictions wrong.</p> <p><strong>10.58am</strong> Bulgaria's Jordan Jovtchev has lost his appeal against the men's rings result after his team claimed that the eventual winner, Dimosthenis Tampakos of Greece, was credited with too high a difficulty rating. But the rules state that you can't query another competitor's score, so Tampakos keeps gold and Jovtchev has to make do with silver.</p> <p>\"For an Olympic Games that everyone said would be a disaster, these are turning out rather well aren't they?\" says Andrew Goldsby. \"We've been witnessing triumph, disaster and controversy. What more could you want?\"</p> <p><strong>10.53am</strong> \"Steve Ovett used to hold an interesting view on the decathlon around the time of Daley Thompson's dominance,\" points out Jezz Nash. \"I believe he described it as 'nine Mickey Mouse events and the 1500 metres'.\" I'd have liked to see Ovett trying the pole vault, Jezz.</p> <p><strong>10.50am</strong> The pole vault in the decathlon starts at around 11am, with Dean Macey needing to jump really rather high to stay in with a chance of what would be one of the most astonishing medals of these Olympics.</p> <p>In the meantime, a brief history lesson from Simon Thomas. \"You're completely missing the historical significance of Russia v Hungry in the water polo,\" he screams. \"Sharpen up, man.\" Did they invade them, or something? </p> <p><strong>10.48am</strong> \"Dean Macey is clearly an amazing all-round athlete,\" writes Alex Marklew. \"After all, he has already picked up a bronze in the three-day eventing, albeit with Pippa Funnell strapped to his back.\" Harsh, Alex. But I'll allow it.</p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong> Here's Jonathan Wood. \"Fave quote of the Olympics so far from John Inverdale on 5 live last night, reflecting on Kelly Holmes' success: 'There are loads of people out there with silver medals; but very few with gold'.\" Made me chuckle too, Jonathan.</p> <p> <strong>10.43am</strong> Dean Macey has clawed his way back to fourth in the decathlon after this morning's discus, and there are now just three events to come. Macey threw 48.34m - the sixth-longest throw - to jump three places after a disappointing 110m hurdles. But Macey still trails third-placed Bryan Clay of the USA by 192 points. A medal could prove tricky. Still, GO DEAN, and all that.</p> <p><strong>10.40am</strong> Ah, controversy. It seems the Russians plan to appeal against many of the decisions made in the gymnastics competition because they reckon the judges were biased against them. There were amazing scenes last night during the horizontal bars when spectators booed the low marks given to Russia's Alexei Nemov, and eventually prompted the judges to up their scores. But it didn't make any difference to Nemov's position and he trailed in fifth. </p> <p><strong>10.32am</strong> Lots of Graeco-Roman wrestling going on. Have searched in vain for Giant Haystacks.</p> <p><strong>10.25am</strong> \"True champions are those who are humble in vistory and gracious in defeat,\" writes Robbie McMillan, inventing words as he goes along. \"Mutola is just a sore loser - what did she expect Kelly to do - take it easy so Mutola could keep winning? I don't think so. Nice one Kelly.\"</p> <p><strong>10.22am</strong> More bad news for the Irish after Sonia O'Sullivan's disappointing run in the 5,000m last night. Paul Brizzel, the man who had to duck out of the way of an errant TV camera during his heat at the European Championships in 2002, finished sixth in the first round of the 200m today. So he's out.</p> <p><strong>10.17am:</strong> They tell me Russia's ladies have beaten Hungary 12-11 in the water polo. I mention this only because things are a little quiet at the moment. But well done the Russians.</p> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> Well, good morning. Lawrence here. I'm still buzzing with excitement after Kelly Holmes's gold in the 800m last night. Apparently Maria Mutola, her former training partner, has accused Holmes of taking advantage of her injury, which seems like a bit of an odd whinge in an Olympic final. Oh well. Here's Holmes herself. \"It was the hardest race I have run,\" she said. \"My heart just took me to the line.\" And they say romance has no place in sport. </p> <p><strong>10am:</strong> James Coney has set an essay for all you budding sports science students. \"Decathletes. Jack of all trades but master of none, or great all-round competitors. Discuss.\" Now if I had been set that kind of exam question in my English Finals (rather than \"In what ways has lexicography developed over the past century\"), I might have squeezed a first-class degree. My brief opinion, both statements are true. Clearly they are masters of none of the disciplines, otherwise they would be able to compete in the individual events. Their times and distances are down on the individual finals. But, of course, how can someone expect to be a top-class competitor in both the 100m and the 1500m - the two events require different body-types. Yet, of course, to be able to achieve a very good, if not world-class, level at so many events shows they are also great all-round athletes. I must now head off, as this fence I'm sitting on is starting to ache. I leave you in the capable hands of Lawrence Booth.</p> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> For all you kayaking enthusiasts out there, and I know there are some, Ian Wynne has won his K1 500m first round heat, recording the best time of all the competitors. Lucy Hardy is through to the women's equivalent event, finishing fourth in her heat. </p> <p>It has just been reported that Darren Campbell limped out of the Olympic stadium this morning, and will struggle to be fit for tonight's second round of the 200m. The Manchester man has a tight hamstring.</p> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Mixed fortune for Britain's sprinters in the men's 200m. Christian Malcolm looked good as he cruised home in second in his heat, while Darren Campbell struggled to fourth place, just enough to see him into the second round. But Chris Lambert dropped out halfway round the bend, citing a tight hamstring. In Malcolm's heat, Asafa Powell almost caused a sensation by easing up too early on the straight. The Jamaican, favourite for gold, was pushed down to fourth and almost run out of the qualification spots. He would have had only himself to blame, and it would have been most amusing. The other main contenders for the medals all looked typically arrogant, Shaun Crawford looking particularly expressive as he made a point of revealing to his rivals how much better he is than his first round competitors. Justin Gatlin, the 100m champion, also moved serenely into the second round.</p> <p>Andy Turner and Rob Newton, meanwhile, both missed out in the men's 110m hurdles - the days when Britain used to dominate this event with Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett are long gone. Allen Johnson, who seems to have been around forever, and Anier Garcia, the reigning champion, both won their heats.</p> <p><strong>9.15am:</strong> Good morning everyone, welcome to day 12 (or is it day 13, I lose count?) of the Olympics. It should be a busy day, with Amir Khan boxing for at least a bronze in the men's lightweight category, Chris Newton going for gold in the men's cycling points race final, the men's football semi-finals, and Hicham El Guerrouj looking for that elusive first Olympics title.</p> <p>Dean Macey was up early, before me, and has already competed in two disciplines of the decathlon. His time of 14.56secs in the 110m hurdles saw him drop to seventh from his overnight standing of fourth, 155 points behind Bryan Clay, of America, in the bronze medal position. Macey has since thrown 48.34m in the discus first round, a hearty throw. News of the men's 200m heats and 110m hurdles first round in the next update.</p>",
  "A council is to lobby the government to buy migrant workers sleeping rough a one-way ticket home. <p>The unorthodox 'rough sleepers' initiative' is the brainchild of Westminster council, which has identified a number of foreign nationals from the new EU states on its patch, mainly from Poland.</p> <p>The council believes many migrants have been victims of scams which offered travel, guaranteed employment, and accommodation in return for up-front payments, which people have handed over in good faith only to find themselves destitute once they arrive.</p> <p>The council leader, Simon Milton, is scheduled to meet with the Home Office for talks next month, to press for solutions to a problem it fears could be on the rise.</p> <p>He wants the government to pay for councils who wish to offer foreign rough sleepers the option to go back to their country of origin.</p> <p>The council is also targeting embassies to send a strong message about the pitfalls of migrants arriving without proper preparation.</p> <p>Under existing rules, EU nationals from the accession countries are not eligible to claim benefits for the first two years after arriving to Britain, leaving many destitute if their jobs fall through.</p> <p>Only those who have worked in the UK for 12 continuous months will be eligible for the full range of benefits accorded to fellow EU members. </p> <p>Mr Milton said the Home Office, not the local authority, should pay for people's travel tickets home.</p> <p>\"I think initially it is for the government to sort out because the problem is a result of government actions and we would look to them to solve it.

  "One of France's ex-terrorists is missing. Cesare Battisti, the Italian ex-guerrilla turned thriller writer and pin-up of the far left who was granted asylum by a sympathetic Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1985 after a court in Rome handed down a life sentence in his absence, has apparently fled. <p>The precise nature of Battisti's revolutionary activities has never been entirely clear. Born in 1954, the biography on his website records that he joined an organisation called Armed Proletarians for Communism in 1976 after various run-ins with the police. In 1979, he fell foul of what he describes as a \"vast anti-terrorist operation\" and was jailed.</p> <p>Two years later, Battisti escaped - first to France and then to Mexico, where he worked as a journalist before returning to Paris. Mr Mitterrand allowed him to stay on condition that he renounced all terrorist activities and did not attempt to flee.</p> <p>Several critically acclaimed thrillers followed, including the semi-autobiographical The Last Bullets. In 1993, an Italian court found Battisti guilty in his absence of the murders of a prison guard, a policeman, and a neo-fascist militant.</p> <p>But it was not until February of this year that the French government - keen to avoid the charge that it was soft on terrorists - finally bowed to pressure from Rome and arrested him.</p> <p>Much to the disgust of his supporters, a French court subsequently ruled that he could be extradited to Italy. His lawyers claim the only evidence against him was supplied by turncoats and that at least one of them was tortured during the trial.</p> <p>Fred Vargas, another thriller writer, promptly rushed out a book protesting his innocence, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur Cesare Battisti. The man himself insisted in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche earlier this month that he had never killed anyone. The French left, meanwhile, urged President Jacques Chirac not to betray a man to whom his predecessor had granted asylum.</p> <p>Battisti's lawyers accused the government of breaching the European convention of human rights in accepting the verdict of the Italian court.</p> <p>It was to no avail. Faced with an intransigent government and the prospect of spending the rest of his life in jail without a retrial, Battisti failed to sign in at the local police station last Saturday for his weekly check.</p> <p>\"If he has fled, which I can only suppose he has, he is entitled to defend himself,\" Ms Vargas told Lib\u00e9ration today. \"I've seen the psychological damage that the media's campaign against him has done.\"</p> <p>\"He realised that the separation of power no longer exists, that Chirac and Berlusconi had made up their minds to condemn him,\" she added. \"He was becoming more and more fragile.\" She told France Inter radio she was afraid he would harm himself.</p> <p>There was plenty of sympathy for the fugitive today among those who sympathised with his armed struggle against the Italian state. \"He was trapped,\" a communist senator told Lib\u00e9ration. \"There was no possibility of a retrial in Italy.\"</p> <p>\"He chose life, and I'm happy for him,\" another ex-member of the Red Brigades, Oreste Scalzone, told the paper.</p> <p>The Italian government was less sanguine at the news that France had allowed Battisti to get away. Roberto Castelli, a minister in the Italian government, praised the French courts for ordering his extradition this morning but attacked French \"leftwing intellectuals\" who, he said, had more sympathy for terrorists than their victims.</p>",
  "Japan's justice ministry today rejected former chess champion Bobby Fischer's demand for protection as a political refugee and issued an order to deport him. <p>Fischer, detained since July 13 for attempting to travel with an invalid US passport, quickly appealed the decision, and his supporters said he would not be deported immediately. </p> <p>The former chess champion is wanted in the United States for violating international sanctions against Yugoslavia in 1992, but he has alleged the charges against him are politically motivated. </p> <p>The justice ministry would not release a timetable for Fischer's deportation, but ministry official Hideharu Maruyama said he would most likely be sent to the United States. \"The justice minister's judgment was that there was no justification for Fischer's appeal,\" the official said. </p> <p>Fischer's lawyers said they had already filed suit in Tokyo district court, demanding that the order be cancelled and requesting an injunction to halt deportation proceedings. His attorney, Masako Suzuki, said the court typically takes about one month to consider the written request for an injunction on the deportation process.</p> <p>The chess player's supporters in Japan protested the ruling, saying immigration officials had planned to deport him later today, but that the legal manoeuvres on Fischer's behalf had apparently stalled that. \"We managed to nip in the bud this fly-by-night effort to deport Bobby without due process,\" said John Bosnitch, a Tokyo-based advisory to Fischer. </p> <p>The deportation order is the latest development in Fischer's legal wrangle with Japanese authorities. As well as appealing for asylum, Fischer has attempted to renounce his US citizenship and has announced plans to marry a Japanese woman in a bid to win Tokyo's sympathy. </p> <p>Mr Bosnitch accused the US government of pressuring Japanese officials to speed up proceedings against Fischer, but said that such efforts would prove much more difficult when the case moves to the courtroom. </p> <p>\"The court will now consider the request for the injunction. If that's granted, then nothing can happen,\" he said. \"That's our desire, to effectively put the stopper in this bottle.\" </p> <p>Fischer rose to chess stardom by defeating Boris Spassky, formerly of the Soviet Union, in a series of games in 1972 to claim the world championship. The chess legend, however, became increasingly erratic and reclusive after the Spassky match and lost his title as world champion in 1978. </p> <p>In a 1992 rematch against Spassky, Fischer won and collected more than \u00a32m in prize money, violating UN sanctions by attending the match held in the former Yugoslavia.</p>",
  "<p>One year ago I rode out of Lima into the grey desert. Two years ago I was seeking shade in fiery Botswana beneath a baobab tree's spindly limbs. And three years ago was where it all began, waving goodbye to my family at home in Yorkshire. I rode out one midsummer morning with the hopelessly unrealistic dream of cycling round the world. Through my journey I aimed to promote the work of Hope and Homes for Children, an organisation committed and passionate in its work with orphans of war and AIDS. To my great surprise I am still going, and I sit today in northern Alaska with four continents now lying in my tyre tracks.</p> <p>The last 12 months started and ended with reckless detours. On an ill-chosen \"scenic route\" through northern Peru I had pushed the bike uphill along a deserted track for some days when I saw a battered little bus approach; frantic Indians shouting and waving told me that they had just been held up at gunpoint. The driver accelerated away and I was left in silence with the unpleasant prospect of armed bandits up ahead. I stopped at every curve to crawl forwards and scout the land, leaping into ditches at the slightest sound and cycled through a sleepless night. Never have I been so happy to see a main road again.</p> <p>A man in a cafe in Ecuador looked me up and down and declared, \"with a body like that you'll never make it.\" I entered Colombia in a state of terror, wondering about the fine line between bravery and stupidity and deciding that the line does not really matter. Colombia is certainly loco but, feeling very selfish towards my family, I decided that surely the land of Shakira couldn't be all bad. And immediately the people and the lust for life of Colombia entranced me. Beautiful Cartagena was the shining jewel of Colombia, my reward for having taken the risk. As the Poker beer labels say in Colombia- \"Where your friends are: that's your home.\"</p> <p>Between Colombia and Panama lies 50 miles of jungle, the notorious Darien Gap. My plan had always been to try and cross it, but this time discretion won the day: I hitched a ride around it on a yacht. We anchored in the San Blas islands to work on the boat for a few days. The Rugby World Cup final was on and there I was stuck on a tropical island with nothing but palm trees, coral reefs, a yacht, lobster for dinner (again) - and not a TV for hundreds of miles. I suppose paradise is open to interpretation.</p> <p>Sailing through the Panama canal, I learned how to use a sextant in child-like wonder: to be able to pinpoint your exact location on Earth using the sun and a wristwatch is astounding. Christmas Eve and a storm arrived together, hitting us hard in the night. I clawed my way up to the bow to take in sail with the boat heeling hard and the salt spray stinging, holding on very tight and feeling very alive. The storm peaked at 56 knots of wind. It was a memorable Christmas Eve.</p> <p>In mad Mexico City- the urban equivalent of \"how many people can you fit in a phone box?\" - my host had to leave town for a weekend so she compiled a list of her girl-friends' phone numbers, each of whom had been briefed to entertain me. Latin American hospitality will take some beating. But I also saw families foraging on rubbish dumps and then attended parties in lavish penthouse suites. </p> <p>The cold nights in the Sonora desert of northern Mexico were beautiful, toasting tortillas on small campfires among tall cacti. I always enjoyed riding through Mexican villages. Dim stores that sell the same few things the third world over - dusty pasta, cans of sardines spotted with rust, colourful warm fizzy drinks and stale biscuits. In the plazas old men sat still in the white sunlight, their faces carved with shadows beneath wide-brimmed sombreros. Curious old ladies stared at me unblinking. Preconceptions are generally made to be broken, but I was delighted to see that, in the best tradition of Speedy Gonzalez, rural Mexican men really do wear very large sombreros and say \"Andale! Andale!\" a lot.</p> <p>I was sad to be leaving Latin America behind: I would miss the tightness and importance of families, the huge meals and the warmth of the people. But after being the odd one out for so long, I was excited to be returning to speaking English, looking anonymously like most other people, and the general ease of life in the United States. I felt like I was going on holiday.</p> <p>At the border I had to go into a special room to explain why I had visas for lots of axis-of-evil countries in my passport. I was interviewed twice and paid a record $100 to get into the US. It seems in this era that even if \"you're with us\", you still might be \"against us\".</p> <p>But they let me in and as I rode, mesmerised at being back in the first world the words \"Large and in charge\" scrolled across a massive billboard. A fitting slogan for the US, perhaps, but in fact just an advert for McDonald's. For me, seeing now with new eyes after two years in the developing world, the US was incredible. I went immediately to a supermarket to gawp in glee at the heaving shelves and the astonishing variety of breakfast cereal.</p> <p>Los Angeles was the zenith of American hedonism and I wondered, how would it feel to be so rich and able to indulge in every spending whim? But then I realised that in most countries people gaze at me in fascination, at my own unattainable wealth, at my opportunities and my freedom. In most of the world I am a man on a fully loaded bicycle so I am very rich. In the US I was a man on a fully loaded bicycle so I was very poor.</p> <p>I arrived in shining white San Francisco, the epitome of the beat generation's road fever. And, boy, here I was at last too! Wheee! Riding my darned bike up them crazy steep streets you always see in the movies, with those wild old trams and the tracks burning silver-white in the sunshine and mesmeric dreadlocked girls looking and smiling real pretty. </p> <p>There was a massive outpouring of Irish-ness for St Patrick's Day. It is certainly a bigger event in America than it is in Ireland. Enormous volumes of Guinness, rivers dyed green; a celebration of heritage. Even MTV proudly celebrated the occasion- with a stirring, skirling, nostalgic bagpipe rendition of ... Flower of Scotland.</p> <p>I rode north at Easter through the Redwood forests, awesome groves of the tallest trees on the planet, filled with a heady silence fitting for such majestic things - some of whom have stood since Jesus. Yet in the US something as startling as a 2,000-year-old, 300ft tree is not enough and so one of the trees now has a huge hole chain-sawed through it so that you can drive your car through the tree. Such depths of entertainment delight me immensely.</p> <p>My experience of the US was massively positive, finding a friendly, hospitable, religious country with vibes surprisingly not far removed from Arabic countries I know and respect. This is not the country currently being portrayed to the world by its leaders. I headed on into Canada and wilderness beautiful and vast. </p> <p>One of the worst fire seasons in history hung over the Yukon Territory like a pall. The Top of the World Highway was closed due to smoke and I could ride no further. Fortunately a friend joined me for this stretch, so we were able to pile up a 17ft canoe ridiculously high with our bikes, bags and two weeks' supply of food and push off towards the next road, 500 miles away, hoping that we would quickly figure out how to canoe.</p> <p>I relished the new challenge and the ever-changing Yukon River; at times jade green and steady with strange boils of water rising and swirling. At times, a sliding mirror. At times shallow and clear so you could look down and watch the pebbles rush past, colourful time capsules, colossally old. We camped on islands, belted out Robert Service's virile poems, failed to catch salmon and watched moose and bear and imperious bald eagles.</p> <p>But then we came upon the Five Finger Rapids which pessimists had long since declared to be our nemesis. We so nearly made it through on sheer luck and enthusiasm, but the canoe was too heavily laden and at each wave we shipped more and more water until, with a little sigh of apology, the canoe rolled, flipped and dumped us into the cold river. The river was fast and the canoe incredibly heavy. We feared she would sink. It would not have been ideal to lose my entire worldly possessions several days' hike from the nearest road. We whizzed helplessly downstream. The situation was just about on the cusp of turning from amusing into serious when we managed to haul ourselves into an eddy and get to shore. I have never known such uncontrollable shivering. Everything was soaked but we had, sort of, survived and we were jubilant. We paraphrased Lance Armstrong as our explanation for this foolish stunt of reckless, testosterone bravado, \"50% was for the adventure, and 50% was for those who never believed.\"</p> <p>Afterwards I continued north on the bike to Alaska, the end of my fourth continent and 44th country. Only now am I starting to let myself believe that I may actually be able to finish this journey. After 28,000 miles I now only have to cross to Siberia and ride across Eurasia! I am homeward bound at last.</p> <p> \u00b7 See Alastair's website at <a href=\"http://www.roundtheworldbybike.com\">roundtheworldbybike.com</a> for more information.</p> <p>\u00b7 If you feel moved to donate, please send cheques to:<br> Hope and Homes for Children<br> East Clyffe<br> Salisbury<br> Wiltshire<br> SP3 4LZ<br> or donate online at <a href=\"http://www.hopeandhomes.org\">hopeandhomes.org</a></p>",

They all tell the same story; in recent days and weeks, there have been fresh attacks on black African villages involving Janjaweed fighters backed up by Sudanese government troops. </p> <p>Despite a UN security council resolution demanding that Sudan disarms the Janjaweed, Khartoum's war against its own people goes on. </p> <p>UN officials say that 11 vil lages close to the border with Chad are believed to have been cleared in a campaign that began a few days after the security council resolution was passed. </p> <p>Nearly 500 refugees have been registered by the UN after crossing the border at Senett, near the village of Birak in eastern Chad. </p> <p>Abdel Moula Abdullahi, 25, told the Guardian he had escaped an attack on Diba village in west Darfur on August 9. \"They came at 6am. It was raining and everyone was in the village,\" he said. \"The women cried out: 'The Janjaweed are coming'. </p> <p>\"The men and women ran from the village. As they were running, the Janjaweed were shooting. </p> <p>\"The Sudanese military came with five vehicles. They shot the people with machine guns. The Janjaweed threw hand grenades to burn down our houses.\" </p> <p>Mr Abdullahi's home now is a piece of plastic sheeting spread over a framework of branches, with a handful of possessions inside; blackened cooking pans, a dagger and an ancient plastic tub of blue hair gel. There is a waist-high stockade of branches to keep animals out. </p> <p>Another refugee, Osman Yahya Khadir, 52, escaped an attack on Gazmoun village last Wednesday. According to his account, Sudanese military helicopters circled in the sky overhead while Janjaweed attacked on the ground. </p> <p>\"When I heard the noise of the helicopters, I ran to hide in the mountains, because I knew the Janjaweed would come,\" said Mr Khadir, a tall man in a long, white robe. </p> <p>\"I knew from the other villages that it had happened like that. They told me: 'When you hear the helicopters and the planes, the Janjaweed are coming'. </p> <p>\"We drove our herds of animals towards the mountains. The Janjaweed came to take our animals and killed five people.\" Both these villages have previously been attacked by Janjaweed and government forces, and their inhabitants had fled to Chad. </p> <p>In recent months, some refugees had returned across the border to rebuild their lives, but renewed attacks have killed or driven away those who went back to Darfur. </p> <p>Mr Abdullahi, dressed in a khaki green tunic and ragged green trousers, said: \"The first time we were attacked was one year ago. Aeroplanes dropped bombs, and there were Janjaweed on horses and soldiers in cars. My father and my father's brother were killed. </p> <p>\"One month ago, we returned to our village. Everything was destroyed and we rebuilt it all. We only had one or two cows left. </p> <p>\"The government of Sudan sent envoys to Chad to say it is safe to return, and we believed they were telling the truth because they were the state.\" </p> <p>As he speaks, sitting on a straw mat flanked by a group of male refugees, the low growling of an Antonov plane's engines becomes audible. The men fall silent; the Russian-built planes are the favoured bombers of the Sudanese government. </p> <p>Many of the refugees are members of the Djabar tribe, which has not played a large part in the Darfur rebellion. </p> <p>Although there are rebel strongholds to the north and south of the region which has recently come under attack, there is no significant rebel activity in or near these villages. </p> <p>Instead, the motive for the Janjaweed appears to be an opportunity to acquire the livestock of the black villagers and steal their land. </p> <p>It is harder to understand why the government continues to back the Janjaweed when there is no rebellion to crush. The refugees believe it is because the regime in Khartoum is racist. </p> <p>Mr Abdullahi said: \"The government of Sudan doesn't want blacks, they want only Arabs. </p> <p>\"Before the first attack, some Arabs in the region came to tell us: 'We're going to send you blacks away and claim this land for ourselves'.\" </p> <p>The landscape of eastern Chad is a mirror image of Darfur. With the rainy season, a transformation has taken place, and a countryside of barren sand, rock and straggling bushes wears a thin covering of green, as if it has been freshly painted. </p> <p>Herds of camels, goats and cattle are accompanied by wobbly calves, greedily cropping the grass before the dry season returns. </p> <p>But the refugees say their lands in Darfur were far more fertile than the border region. </p> <p>Their rival Arab tribes want the land \"because the land of Darfur is rich, and there are many animals, plenty of riches, oil under the ground,\" said one refugee. </p> <p>Hundreds of refugees have now fled across the border once again. But even here, they claim, they are being pursued by the Janjaweed. </p> <p>On August 12, a family of refugees was sleeping in a stockade of branches at Senett when they were fired on. It was then that Hawa Abdullahi was shot through the arm and her brothers, aged 12, 15, 18 and 21, were killed or fatally injured. </p> <p>Hawa said: \"I was sleeping when I heard something in the night. Before I could ask my brothers what it was, there was gunfire. I got up straightaway, then I was hit in the arm and cried out for my mother.\" </p> <p>According to Hawa's father, Abdullahi Ibrahim, who ran from his sleeping place to the scene of the shooting, the gunman escaped with an accomplice who was holding their horses. They fled in the direction of Sudan. </p> <p>\"This did not happen because they wanted to steal from us,\" Mr Ibrahim said. \"But because this is the manner in which they treat our people.\" </p> <p>Under a burning sun, Mr Ibrahim, a barefoot man in a tattered green robe, goes to pray over three mounds of sandy yellow earth covered in branches. Three of his sons lie there, while a fourth lies dead at a clinic in nearby Birak. </p> <p>Fresh green shoots of grass have sprung from the base of each mound, though they are only a week old. </p> <p>This should be a time of rejoicing and renewal for the black farmers of Darfur; when the long-awaited rains bring the promise of new life. But this year the rainy season is only bringing more death.</p>",
  "Figures published today are expected to show a continued fall in the number of new asylum claims. <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, is issuing asylum data for April, May and June of this year. </p> <p>In the first three months of this year, Home Office statistics revealed the number of new applications slid by 20% to 10,585, including dependants such as spouses and children. </p> <p>Revised and finalised figures for the whole of 2003 - published in provisional form in February - are also due out. According to these initial figures, asylum applications excluding dependants dropped to 49,370 in 2003 a fall of 41% from the previous year, or 61,050 including dependants compared with 103,800 in 2002. </p> <p>Refugee charities said that despite the fall in numbers there was no indication that the world had become safer, and came as the humanitarian situation in Sudan was causing international concern. </p> <p>The number of applications for asylum in the UK from Sudanese nationals dropped by 30% to only 265 in the first quarter of this year, the Refugee Council's deputy chief executive Margaret Lally said. \"The government must turn its attention to what really matters - its responsibility to provide protection to those who need our help,\" she added.</p> <p>\"We need to make sure that our doors are always open for people who are fleeing persecution, torture or other human rights abuses.\" </p> <p>The chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Habib Rahman, said: \"The UK's increasingly harsh system, which includes imprisonment of asylum seekers and forcible deportations, may be responsible for driving many asylum seekers underground if they manage to reach this country.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The fact that millions of people worldwide continue to suffer under repressive regimes, yet do not claim asylum in the UK, is not necessarily a cause for celebration. </p> <p>In May, the Home Office's statistics were criticised as \"materially misleading\", by spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) </p> <p>Although it said data was broadly accurate, the auditors said the figures had missed out up to 24,000 asylum seekers receiving welfare and accommodation funding. This error would make the real figure receiving support more than 100,000 rather than the 76,245 published total. </p> <p>The Conservative home affairs spokesman, Humfrey Malins, said that a small fall in the asylum figures was meaningless. </p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio's Today programme, he said: \"If there are fewer asylum applications in the last quarter, most people believe that that could mean greater numbers of people are still entering the country illegally, because our borders are not secure, and simply not bothering to claim asylum.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' spokesman, Mark Oaten, also dismissed the expected fall in the figures. \"I think that having a target or being obsessed by numbers is just the wrong way to look at this,\" he told the Today programme. \"If there was a disaster in Somalia or Iraq, surely we would want to see an increase because it would mean that we were taking people who were fleeing persecution. </p> <p>The immigration minister, Des Browne, said that falling claims reflected the success of measures such as the establishment of UK border controls in France and Belgium. </p> <p>He accused the opposition parties of trying to cast doubt on the figures for political reasons. \"When these asylum figures, prepared in exactly the same way by exactly the same officials and published in exactly the same way, showed about 18 months ago historically high figures of asylum seekers, they were happy to rely upon them,\" he told the Today programme. </p> <p>\"Now that they are dropping significantly, and have been over the last 18 months, they are no longer reliable figures. Isn't that surprising?\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>10.23pm:</strong> \"Canada's been havin' a bleedin awful Olympics,\" writes Richard Noble from Canada. \"With Perdita Felicien's bib number of 1313, what do you think her chances were that this would happen? Over here, the sky-scrapers dont have 13th floors just because its seen as an unlucky number.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, an epic women's pole vault competition has ended. Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva has vaulted a new world record of 4.91m, beating her compatriot Svetlana Feofanova's 4.75m into a cocked hat. Poland's Anna Rogowska (4.70m) was third. That's your lot from Athens tonight. Tune in tomorrow morning for more hapless reporting on a variety of sports from people with very little idea of what it is they're talking about. </p> <p> <strong>9.54pm:</strong> Interesting news in the aftermath of the women's 100m hurdles, won by Joanna Hayes of the USA. As you may recall, Canada's Perdita Felicien hit the first hurdle, tripped and took out Russia's Irina Shevchenko at the second set of hurdles. </p> <p>It turns out that the Russian has lodged an appeal at the unfairness of it all and the medal ceremony has been delayed so that the whole mess can be sorted out tomorrow. According to the BBC experts, a re-run of the race would not be unprecedented. </p> <p> <strong>9.45pm:</strong> Hicham El Guerrouj wins the 1500m in 3.34.18 with as brave a performance as you're ever likely to see in the Olympics or any other sporting arena. He took the lead with two laps to go, he was caught and looked beaten by Kenya's Bernard Lagat in the finsihing straight with less than 100m to go, but dug on his reserves to fight back, get his nose in front and win by inches. A sensational win in a brilliant race. Hicham El Guerrouj is the Olympic champion. Portugal's Rui Silva won the bronze medal, while Great Britain's Michael East came sixth. </p> <p><strong>9.35pm:</strong> Eyes down for the final of the men's 1500m final, in which everyone will be rooting for the sentimental favourite and world record holder, Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj. He should have won in Atlanta and Sydney, but fell in one and suffered a crisis of confidence in the other. He's clearly the best runner in tonight's field, but will he prevail and ocmplete his set of medals with an Olympic gold? </p> <p> <strong>9.19pm:</strong> The knackered decathlon competitors drag themselves around the track for their final event, with Dean Macey finishing in a very creditable second in the race. He's out of the medals, but Roman Sebrele (Czech Republic) wins the gold medal with a new Olympic record of 8893 points. Bryan Clay (USA) wins silver and Dmitry Karpov (Kazakhstan) wins bronze. Canvey Island's Dean Macey was fourth. </p> <p> <strong>9.03pm:</strong> \"Barry, if you could have your pick of winning a gold medal in the 100m for England or a bronze in the trampoline for Ireland what would it be?\" asks Howard Davies, apropos nothing. As I'm not English and only ever run if I'm being pursued, it's a redundant question Howard. Particularly as England don't have a team at the Olympics. For the year that's in it, I'd definitely take the bronze for Ireland in the trampoline. Considering how abysmally my compatriots have been performing in Athens, it would be enough to make me a national hero. </p> <p>Still to come tonight - the result of the women's pole vault final, the concluding event of the decathlon (that's the 1500m to you) and the men's 1500m final. </p> <p><strong>8.52pm:</strong> Fight! Fight! Fight! News reaches us of an amusing <em>contretemps</em> of sorts between a British sprinter and the BBC's studio experts. It has been alleged that British sprinter Darren Campbell gave Colin Jackson and Michael Johnson both barrells after his second round 200m race by calling them \"wankers\". </p> <p>Campbell came through his second round race in fourth place to qualify for the semi-finals as one of the fastest losers, but as he made his way through the mixed zone clutching his right hamstring, all he would say is: 'Tell Colin and Michael they're both wankers!'. </p> <p>The sprinter later denied ever having made the comments about the two former track stars. </p> <p> <strong>8:51pm:</strong> Tonique Williams-Darling from the Bahamas wins an incredible race from 2. Ana Guevara (Mexico) and Natalya Antyukh (Russia), in a time of 49.41. </p> <p>In the men's football semi-finals, Paraguay have ended Iraq's fairytale run, beating them 3-1. They will play their South American rivals Argentina, 3-0 victors over Italy, in the final. </p> <p> <strong>8.50pm:</strong> Next up is the women's 400m final. Refresh the page in about 49.42 seconds to see who won. </p> <p> <strong>8.30pm:</strong> According to the BBC, British 400m hurdler Chris Rawlinson was distracted by an advertising hoarding as he approached his first hurdle, hence his non-qualification. Surely it can't have come as a huge shock to a professional athlete to see garish ads surrounding the running track of an athletics stadium? </p> <p> Meanwhile in the final of the women's 100m hurdles, Joanna Hayes takes gold for the USA, Olena Krasovska (Ukraine) takes silver and Melissa Morrison (USA) takes bronze. There was carnage in the early stages when pre-race favourite and world champion Perdita Felicien (Canada) hit the first hurdle with her lead leg, proceeded to fall over and take out Irina Shevchenko at the second set of hurdles. It was dreadfully unfair on the Russian, who was left with no chance through no fault of her own. But then life sucks - what can you do? </p> <p> <strong>8.14pm:</strong> Jamaica's Veronica Campbell, favourite for the women's 200m, wins her semi-final easily, in a personal best time of 22:14. Aleen Bailey (Jamaica), Kim Gevaert (Belgium) and Debbie Ferguson (Bahamas) also qualify for tomorrow's final. </p> <p> <strong>8.12pm</strong> Great Britain's Abi Oyepitan qualifies for the women's 200m, finishing second in her semi-final in a time of 22:56. Speaking to Sally Gunnell after her heat, she claims she wasn't particularly happy with her effort, despite it being her second fastest ever time over the distance. American Allyson Felix won, by the way, while 44-year-old veteran Merlene Ottey went out. </p> <p>After nine events in the decathlon, the Czech Republic's Roman Sebrle leads from America's Brian Clay. Kazak Dmitry Karpov lies in third place, while Great Britain's Dean Macey is in fifth and unlikely to be troubling the bloke presenting the medals. </p> <p> <strong>7:48pm:</strong> For the second time in history, Kenya take first, second and third in the 3000m steeplechase in a time of 8:05:83. Looking over his own shoulder to encourage his team-mates for the final 200 metres, Kemboi finishes in first place followed by his compatriots Kipruto and Koech. </p> <p> <strong>7:36pm:</strong> As the men's 3000m steeplechase gets underway, Simon Thomas writes in with a question about the boxing. \"Did the Kazak beat the Cuban?\" he asks. \"The Cuban was meant to be very handy indeed.\"</p> <p>To the best of my admittedly limited knowledge, Simon, the Cuban - Mario Cesar Kindelan Mesa - is still in the competition and on course to meet Amir Khan in the final. As for him being handy, I'm reliably informed that he only has two, just like the boy Khan. </p> <p> <strong>7:27pm:</strong> A note for your diaries: Amir Khan will fight Serik Yeleuov of Kazakhstan on Friday for a place in the lightweight semi-final of the boxing tournament. Win or lose - and after tonight's performance defeat looks unlikely - a bronze medal is guaranteed. When I was his age I couldn't beat my way out of a wet paper bag. Still can't, come to think of it. </p> <p> <strong>7.13pm:</strong> Great Britain's Hayley Tullett scrapes into the semi-finals of the women's 1500m semi-finals as fastest loser. In the semi-final of the men's 400m hurdles, Chris Rawlinson jogs across the line in last place after giving his first hurdle a terrible clatter. </p> <p> <strong>6:58pm</strong> An outstanding performance sees Amir Khan through, with the referee stopping the fight inside of the first round. A sensational effort from the Bolton teenager, which sees him into the light-weight semi-final on Friday. </p> <p> <strong>6.54:</strong> Great Britain's Amir Khan and his South Korean opponent Jong Sub Baik touch gloves and their four round bout gets underway. If the 17-year-old from Bolton wins this fight he is guaranteed a bronze medal at the very least. Khan punches his way into an early 6-2 lead, before catching the Korean with a peach of a right hand that drops him to his knees. The referee tells the Korean to carry on, Khan gets him on the ropes with a flurry of punches and the referee stops the fight. </p> <p> <strong>6.48pm:</strong> Olympic 800m gold medallist Kelly Holmes comes from a mile behind the field to comfortably qualify for the second round of the 1500m behind Russia's Yevdokimova. Under interrogation from the ever-irritating Sally Gunnell, she says she didn't get much sleep last night as she was buzzing off her victory in the 800m. If they handed out gold medals for poor interview technique, Ms Gunnell's would be bent double from the amount of expensive metal dangling from her neck. </p> <p>Meanwhile in the sand-pit, Great Britain's Chris Tomlinson qualifies for the men's long jump final with a fine leap of 8m 23cm. </p> <p> <strong>6.35pm</strong> Hayley Tullet struggled in the first heat to finish seventh, but the newly canonised Kelly Holmes is coming up. I'll leave you now in the capable hands of Barry Glendenning.</p> <p><strong>6.28pm</strong> Both Campbell and Malcolm have made it through to the semi final as fastest losers, but Campbell looks like he'll be doing nothing more than putting his feet up and watching Corrie for the next few days. </p> <p>Women's 1500m heats up next...</p> <p><strong>6.21pm</strong> In the decathlon, Bryan Clay's just lobbed the javelin 66.97m, so I think we can discount Dean \"58.46m\" Macey coming home with any precious metals.</p> <p>Darren Campbell's in this next heat, next to Francis Obikwelu. Can he drag him through? (Not literally, before you email, I do understand that that would be perfectly illegal). He came away at the end to finish fourth, and he's hopping worryingly. I usually do that to indicate the previous gaff was not entirely my fault...</p> <p><strong>6.15pm</strong> Chris Tomlinson's just made his first attempt in the men's long jump, where he'll need 8.10m to qualify... and it's only 7.76m - but he didn't hit anywhere near the board, so here's hoping.</p> <p>The third heat of the 200m is also on the cards, with Christian Malcom facing not just Justin Gatlin but Asafa Powell. Gulp. He got a good start though... oh dear. Gatlin won it from Powell, and Malcolm stalks off the track having finished fifth. The old fastest losers gamble again, eh?</p> <p><strong>6.08pm</strong> Heat two, and Bernard Williams, the one they're all talking about it seems, takes it in 20.40, just ahead of the Greek Gousis. </p> <p><strong>24 hour clock? Pah! 6.05pm</strong> Evening. Tim Walton wants to add American gymnast Mitch Gaylord to the list, so why not.</p> <p>The second round of the men's 200m is underway, and Shawn Crawford has put everyone else to shame with an easy 19.95s in the first heat.</p> <p><strong>17.57</strong> Right, that's all from me, folks. I'm now handing over to Georgina Turner, who will tend to your every need until 6.30pm or so. Macey's first throw is 49.98m, which is not good.</p> <p><strong>17.55</strong> The javelin in the decathlon has just got under way, with Dean Macey needing either miracle or an injury to one of the three athletes ahead of him to claim a medal.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Carolyn Perry is drowning her sorrows after Italy's defeat in the football. \"Oh dear. I have been in this situation so many times. I chart Italy's path through championships, get tickets, and end up watching the Czech Republic v Portugal or some such game. I'm hoping Iraq win as I don't fancy an all-South America final.\"</p> <p> <strong>17.51</strong> Argentina are through to the final of the men's football, where they will have the chance to win their country's first Olympic gold for 52 years. They will play either Paraguay or (wait for it) Iraq.</p> <p><strong>17.49</strong> \"would carolyn like to sell me her ticket?\" asks Paul Lofthouse as Argentina close in on the final of the football. \"i'd love to go and see my team (argentina) in the final. they have played beautiful football in this tournament. 16 goals scored, none conceded.\"</p> <p> <strong>17.43</strong> Bad news for Carolyn Perry. Argentina are 3-0 up against Italy in the semi-final of the men's football. And there are just six minutes left.</p> <p><strong>17.41</strong> It's extra time in the semi-final of the women's hockey after Argentina equalised right at the end of full-time to make it 2-2 against the Netherlands.</p> <p><strong>17.36</strong> Carolyn Perry has had to \"open a bottle to calm my nerves\". She's an Italy supporter with tickets to the final. Unfortunately, it looks as if she'll be watching Argentina.</p> <p><strong>17.34</strong> \"Mardy Fish,\" suggests Sara Williams in the funny-name game. \"Tennis player rather than a swimmer, which is a shame.\"</p> <p><strong>17.31</strong> It's 2-0 to Argentina!</p> <p><strong>17.27</strong> Argentina still lead Italy 1-0 with only 25 minutes to go in the men's football semi-final. But Duncan Bennett reports that Italy are fighting hard.</p> <p>\"What about Loudy Torkey, the Aussie diver?\" writes Jeremy Peck.</p> <p> <strong>17.25</strong> \"US basketball player Carlos Boozer has my favourite Olympic name,\" says Paul Joicey. \"Just think of the shirt sales that must generate.\"</p> <p><strong>17.20</strong> It's gold for Australia and Ryan Bayley. What a race! He hovered on Bos's shoulder for the second lap, then took him on the final bend. Brilliant! Holland have to settle for silver.</p> <p><strong>17.17</strong> And Paul Lofthouse insists that Holland now lead Argentina 2-1 in the women's hockey semi-final, having been 1-0 down at half-time. Interactive, eh?</p> <p><strong>17.16</strong> Greece are through to the final of the women's water polo after a 6-2 win over Australia.</p> <p><strong>17.15</strong> Theo Bos and Ryan Bayley are emerging for their winner-takes-all showdown in the men's sprint final in the cycling. All very nerve-wracking.</p> <p>\"Theo Boss sounded too good to be true,\" laments James Peterson. \"However it got me thinking of amusingly named Olympic athletes. My list is pretty short but surely the American swimmer Misty Hymen must be up there. Thoughts?\"</p> <p><strong>17.10</strong> While we wait for the deciding race in the men's sprint, here's Joy Clancy with an interesting cultural titbit all the way from Holland. \"Bos means \"wood\" (as in forest rather than the tree product),\" she begins. \"Dutch people were given surnames during the Napoleonic occupation. They saw this an opportunity for a bit of a leg pull - hence many Dutch people are called \"van den Berg\" - i.e. \"from the mountains\". I digress but it must be more interesting than watching people going round lots of times very fast in the velodrome.\" Actually, Joy, I've been gripped. And I'll be cheering for the Dutch bloke. The Aussies have already won far too much.</p> <p> <strong>17.04</strong> Another semi-final in which Argentina lead 1-0 at half-time: in the women's hockey against Holland.</p> <p>\"No - I'm not happy,\" writes Carolyn Perry of Argentina's lead in the football. \"I have the misfortune to be an Italy fan and I'm going to the Final on Saturday!!\" </p> <p> <strong>17.00</strong> Amazing stuff. Ryan Bayley sets up a decider in the final of the men's cycling sprint by doing to Theo Bos (not Boss, as I wrote earlier) what Bos did to him in the first race: namely, pipping him on the line. That's 1-1 with one to go. I'm excited and I'm only a neutral.</p> <p><strong>16.58</strong> Duncan Bennett writes in to report that Argentina are all over Italy. But they only lead by 1-0 at half-time. </p> <p><strong>16.55</strong> The men's sprint bronze has gone to the German cyclist Rene Wolff, who absoutely destroyed Laurent Gane of France. </p> <p>\"If memory serves,\" writes Adrian Bourne, \"wasn't the cox stuck in a boat with the Searle brothers? Pinsent and Redgrave being, at that time, a coxless pair. I think the crying may have been at the absurdity of getting a gold medal for sitting and shouting at two bigger boys.\"</p> <p> <strong>16.52</strong> Canada have won a gold in the women's sprint thanks to Lori-Ann Muenzer, who wins the second race against Russia's Tamilla Abassova to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. </p> <p>\"Am I the only one who finds it mildly amusing that the dutchman's name is so nearly 'The Boss'?\" writes Tom Huddart. \"I doubt it.\"</p> <p><strong>16.48</strong> Anna Meares of Australia picks up a bronze in the women's sprint cycling, pipping Russia's Svetlana Grankovskaya. It's actually quite exciting.</p> <p><strong>16.46</strong> Argentina are beating Italy 1-0 in the men's football semi-final. Happy, Carolyn?</p> <p><strong>16.44</strong> Ross Edgar secures fifth place in the men's cycling sprints in a bizarre ride-off to determine positions five to eight. This takes place before the second race in the final, the first having been won by Theo Boss.</p> <p><strong>16.42</strong> George Chamberlain asks when Amir Khan is fighting for a place in the last four of the lightweight boxing. The answer, George, is 6.45pm tonight.</p> <p>\"I think I am envious of your job,\" writes Tim Potter. \"How did you get to watch the Olympics on tv all day and write about it?\" Oh, friends in the right places, Tim, that's all.</p> <p><strong>16.39</strong> Boss wins the first race in the best-of-three - that was a thriller, with Boss pipping Bayley on the line.</p> <p><strong>16.37</strong> The men's sprint final in the velodrome has just got under way: Ryan Bayley of Australia v Theo Boss of Holland. Watch this space.</p> <p>\"When did all this crying start then?\" asks Jon Cardy. \"I don't remember a previous games where so many of our athletes broke down in tears. I seem to recall the Cox doing it in Atlanta, but then I would cry too if I was only four foot three and I was stuck in a boat with old Redgrave and Pinsent et all.\" </p> <p> <strong>16.32</strong> \"Is it just me,\" asks Rob Mansfield, \"or is the points cycling race, the most bizarre event. Lots of people gently cycling around a small track 160 times, with an occasional sprint for 20 seconds. It can be rivalled, mind you, by the 'madison' cycling event, which I believe is the cycling equivalent of tag-team wrestling.\" Yes, it's very odd, Rob. And it provoked another Paula moment, with the British rider dropping out halfway through the race, much to the consternation of his coach.</p> <p><strong>16.30</strong> \"I am desperate to find out what's happening in the football,\" sobs Carolyn Perry. \"Please put me out of my misery!\" I'd love to oblige, Carolyn, but I'm in the dark as much as you are. But I can reveal that the javelin - the ninth event in the decathlon - gets under way at 5.30pm, with Dean Macey reliant on an injury to one of the three athletes ahead of him if he is to pick up a medal.</p> <p><strong>16.25</strong> Hmm, I'm being driven mad by pop-ups. I suspect I'm not the only one. Anyway, the points race has been won by Mikhail Ignatyev, with Spain's Joan Llaneras claiming silver and Guido Fulst of Germany picking up bronze.</p> <p><strong>16.15</strong> Chris Newton has dropped out of the men's points race in the velodrome. He looked as if he was in tears. Poor fella.</p> <p><strong>16.10</strong> Italy have qualified for the final of the women's water polo with 6-5 win over the USA. We're nothing if not thorough. </p> <p><strong>16.03</strong> Greetings. Please bear with me while I make myself comfortable.</p>",
  "<p>My interview with Paula Radcliffe yesterday was the hardest piece of television I've ever had to do. I was in tears myself when she stopped out on the marathon course, and she was still in a state of real confusion yesterday. But Paula really wanted to do the interview. I spoke to her in the morning and said, you don't have to go through this if you don't want to, but she was really worried about the public reaction and that she'd let people down. </p> <p>When she came into the studio there were quite a few tears. We'd been getting hundreds and hundreds of supportive emails, and I showed them to her just before we went on air. Unfortunately, when she started reading them she said, \"Oh God, that's just made me feel worse.\" </p> <p>I know Paula spent Sunday night in the athletes' village with her husband Gary - officials got him a pass so she wouldn't be on her own. She had her phone off for most of the night but got loads of text messages, and a lot of the other British athletes were very supportive. I get the feeling it's been a difficult one for everyone to deal with. I know Kelly Holmes spoke to Paula, even though it was the night before her 800m final. I think Paula's been a bit overwhelmed by the sympathy that's been shown her. </p> <p>Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. It's a tough sport: you can be the best athlete in the field - and she was - but even if you're the best you still have to be on your game, no one gives you a medal in advance. Paula had a bad day and, unfortunately, I think that's about as good an explanation as we're going to get. </p> <p>Paula did have some tests yesterday, but she knows she won't get any clear answers from them. They'll just show her what she's done to her body, that it's been put through a pretty brutal couple of hours. </p> <p>She's desperate not to offer excuses, because that's her nature. However, I think she's being unfair to herself when she says the incredible heat didn't have anything to do with it. There were some other very good athletes out there whose wheels came off, too. If you're 100% you can cope with extreme conditions, but if you're a little bit off they accentuate your problems. </p> <p>The physical exhaustion is one thing, the mental exhaustion quite another. That's a point I'd like to get across to Paula herself. People ask why did she drop out, but when you're a medal contender, when Olympic gold is all you've been thinking about for years, and suddenly that target is taken away, you just hit a wall: one minute you're running and the next you're completely spent. </p> <p>Paula had already pushed once to get back in the race after a bad patch, and then she saw the medals being taken away again. For people to say she should have jogged the last five or six miles - she could hardly walk, she couldn't even stand up and support herself. </p> <p>Oddly, Paula told me the two ladies who helped and supported her at the side of the road were from Bedford, her home town, and that she knew them from her athletics club. They'd taken that vantage point and it just happened to be where she'd stopped. There were no ambulances, something that should be remedied before Beijing. </p> <p>As for her race tactics, beforehand when I spoke to her she just said what she always does; that she would get into the race and run how she felt, pushing when she felt it was right. The early pace wasn't too hard, it should have been fairly comfortable for her. </p> <p>To those who suggest she couldn't handle the weight of British expectation, all I can say is that when I went out to see her in Spain five weeks ago, she seemed to be coping well. She knew there was an awful lot of pressure on her, but repeated that the most pressure came from herself. We saw her again last Thursday in the athletes' village, and I spoke to her again on Saturday, and she seemed as relaxed as anyone could be the night before their major final. </p> <p>As for injury stories, well, yes she's had little niggles with her calf, but the press have made them mountains rather than molehills. It wasn't the perfect run-in but it wasn't disastrous either. She's had niggles ahead of big races before - when you're competing on the edge that's what happens. But she's not offering them as an excuse. </p> <p>But I do know she was annoyed by some of the silly rumours that were flying around last week - that she'd pulled out of the marathon, that she was only running the 10,000m. It isn't helpful and in my experience it does get to you before a big race. </p> <p>Should she race on Friday? Well, physically she probably won't feel too bad in a couple of days' time - but we could all see what a state she is in emotionally, and that takes much longer to heal. So while there will be a big part of her that wants to get out there again in the 10,000m and show what happened on Sunday wasn't the real Paula Radcliffe, I think she has to look within herself and ask, can she do herself justice? </p> <p>I've done silly things as an athlete - we all think we're superman or superwoman, you don't get to the top without having that belief. But I hope she goes away now and has a couple of days with her family and friends to let some of what's happened sink in. And, personally, I hope she gives Friday's race a miss. </p> <p>Then, as the months go by, the pain will start to heal a little. It'll never completely go - I couldn't bring myself to watch a tape of Seoul 1988 until about two years ago, and Paula might never watch this marathon - but she's a strong person, and she'll run again and she'll win things again. </p> <p>Right now Paula feels as though she's let people down - well, she hasn't and she shouldn't. It's difficult because she cares very much about her sport and about winning for her country. But in my view she's still the best marathon runner in the world. She's worked very hard to learn how to win, and without doubt she can do it again. </p> <p><strong>Greats who failed to win Olympic gold</strong></p> <p><strong>Ron Clarke</strong></p> <p>The Australian set 18 world records during his career, including six over 5,000m and 10,000m, but never won Olympic gold. In 1964 an unknown American Billy Mills scorched past him almost on the finishing line of the 10,000m and finally, in 1968, the altitude of Mexico burnt him out. The great Emil Zatopek felt so sorry for Clarke that he gave him one of his four Olympic gold medals as a consolation. </p> <p><strong>Jim Ryun</strong></p> <p>A teenage sensation who set a world mile record but was twice denied on the biggest stage of all. At Mexico City in 1968 he was beaten into second in the 1500m by the then unknown Kenyan Kip Keino and four years later in Munich fell over in the heats. He is now an American senator.</p> <p><strong>Hicham El Guerrouj</strong></p> <p>The most outstanding middle-distance runner of his generation he is still seeking his first Olympic gold medal. At Atlanta in 1996 he tripped and finished last in the 1500m. Four years later in Sydney he was passed down the home straight by the unknown Kenyan Noah Ngeny. The Moroccan hopes to rectify the situation in Athens.</p> <p><strong>Alberto Salazar</strong></p> <p>Like Radcliffe, the American switched from the track to rewrite the marathon record books. He was the overwhelming favourite to strike gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics but suffered the first defeat of his career and was never the same dominant force again.</p> <p><strong>Ingrid Kristiansen</strong></p> <p>The Norwegian was the Paula Radcliffe of her day, dominating on track, road and country from 3,000m to the marathon. But her best years were sandwiched between Olympics, including setting a world record in the marathon in 1985 that at the time appeared unapproachable. She never won an Olympic medal. It may not be a good omen that she is Radcliffe's heroine.</p> <p><strong>Colin Jackson</strong></p> <p>The Welshman twice won the world 110m hurdles title and his world record of 12.91sec has stood for 11 years But when it came to the Olympics he never improved upon the silver he won on his games debut in 1988 - in fact, never even winning another medal.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The collapse of Australia's Sally Robbins near the end of the women's eights rowing final has unleashed a storm of vitriol in her home country. And she admitted yesterday that her team-mates threatened to throw her overboard. \"Yeah, they did,\" Robbins confirmed. \"I didn't say anything back because I didn't know what to say. I was stunned myself.\" </p> <p>The Australians were fifth 400m from the finish when Robbins fell back on to the legs of Julia Wilson, leaving her oar trailing in the water. With 100m left, she collapsed again and let go of her oar, leaving the boat sixth and last. The Sydney Daily Telegraph claimed she had \"committed the greatest crime there is in honest sport - she quit.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Great Britain's men's hockey team have suffered their worst Olympics finish for 36 years after a dreadful 8-2 defeat by Pakistan in Group A yesterday. The highest Britain can finish is ninth - their worst since Mexico 1968, when they came 12th. </p> <p>Britain took a surprise lead through Niall Stott after five minutes and trailed only 2-1 at the interval before Pakistan hit six goals in the second period. Danny Hall scored Britain's second five minutes from time. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Athanasia Tsoumeleka, a complete outsider, snatched the women's 20km walk title after a thrilling finish to give Greece their first athletics gold of the games. She beat Russia's Olimpiada Ivanova in a close finish, recording 1hr 29 min 12sec. Ivanova was four seconds back with Australia's Jane Saville third. The 22-year-old Tsoumeleka, who had never previously won a major international title, beat her personal best by more than 20 seconds. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The United States beat the world champions Germany 2-1 in a fierce struggle last night to reach the final of the women's football tournament. The Americans, World Cup winners in 1991 and 1999, play Brazil for the gold medal on Thursday after the South Americans carved out a 1-0 win over Sweden in the second semi-final.</p>",
  "The search for the reasons behind Paula Radcliffe's disastrous performance in the Olympic marathon moved yesterday to a medical laboratory in Athens, where blood samples taken from the 30-year-old athlete were being analysed in the hope of discovering some medical explanation for the exhaustion that forced her to come to a halt at the side of the road with four miles of the race still to run. <p>Too distressed to utter more than a single word - \"Devastated\" - in the immediate aftermath of her withdrawal, a pale and red-eyed Radcliffe emerged yesterday to give her version of the events that ended the attempt to crown her career with a gold medal. </p> <p>During yesterday's late-afternoon press conference there were signs of the effects of the distress so clearly evident to a worldwide television audience when she abandoned the race. At one point in the questioning she was forced to call a temporary halt to the proceedings while she composed herself. </p> <p>\"Basically I don't have a lot of explanations at this point,\" she said. \"I'm struggling myself to comprehend what happened and find a reason for it. This morning I had some tests done, and I'm still waiting for the results to come through.\" </p> <p>Of all the 271 athletes who arrived in Athens under the banner of the Great Britain team, Radcliffe seemed to many to be the best bet for a gold medal. </p> <p>But the world record holder, who is considering whether to compete in Friday's 10,000m event, confessed yesterday that there had been \"nothing left in her legs\" when an Ethiopian runner, Elfenesh Alemu, overtook her just over two hours into the marathon, with 22 and a half miles run. </p> <p>What she could say was that the conditions had not been to blame, thus confirming the belief of those who thought that mental turmoil, rather than simply a physical toll, had been responsible for her inability to finish the race. </p> <p>The temperature of 35C (95F), the 35% humidity and the relentless, shadeless hills of the 26-mile course had offered nothing unexpected to an athlete whose preparations for this event during the past 18 months had been almost obsessively single-minded. </p> <p>No athlete in the world has spent more time bringing scientific principles to bear on her diet, on her physical conditioning, and on helping her body to recover from the effects of training and competition. In recent weeks she had trained in seclusion in southern Spain, in the sort of environment she knew she would find last weekend on the road between the village of Marathon and the Panathinaiko stadium in Athens. </p> <p>\"They were tough conditions\", she said yesterday, \"but they were tough for everyone. You have to train to cope with that. I'd done that. The conditions were tough, but I didn't finish the race dehydrated or in any sort of distress from the heat. </p> <p>\"I was prepared. I'd prepared for run ning in the heat. I don't feel the heat was a factor. Where we were in Spain, it was as hot, and probably more humid. And I train on hills the whole time. So I can't say it was a lack of preparation. I'm totally devastated, because this is what it had all been about, preparing for this race. To run that badly and not really have a reason for it is hard.\" </p> <p>There had been rumours that she had been seen visiting the clinic of a German sports doctor, Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt, in recent weeks, seeking treatment for a leg injury, but she refused yesterday to advance that as a factor. </p> <p>\"I did have a slight calf niggle four and a bit weeks ago, and I visited Dr Muller-Wohlfahrt's clinic for a check-up,\" she said. \"I've been going there regularly. I missed two days' training then. And last week I had another niggle. Probably that was a stress, so close to the Olympics There was worry there. But I came through that and I was back training and it didn't bother me in the race.\" </p> <p>Other forms of pressure, she conceded, might have played a part. \"I've had pressure before. Yes, there was more pressure this time, but probably the biggest pressure was from myself. You're always going to be more nervous before the Olympics than you are before other races, but I don't think I can use that as an excuse.\" </p> <p>There were certainly no signs of unusual pressure when she took the lead at the start of the race and held it for 15 miles. The difficulties started when Mizuki Noguchi of Japan, the eventual winner, and Alemu, the Ethiopian, broke away from the leading group of 10 runners. </p> <p>\"I felt reasonably good for the first part of the race,\" Radcliffe said. \"I intended putting in some effort on the tougher parts of the hills and the long climb. I felt good on the first couple of hills. </p> <p>\"Then I had stomach problems at 15 kilometres, but I seemed to come through those, and I went through a bad stage when the two girls broke away. I seemed to feel a bit better when I got back into second place. I was trying to stay positive and feeling that the gap, at that stage, wasn't beyond me. I could pull it back if I held it together.\" </p> <p>The big problems came when the race started the long descent to the finish through the suburbs of Athens. She had become so disorientated that she found herself following the double rows of cats' eyes that marked the bus lane, rather than staying in the middle of the road. </p> <p>\"I was going downhill, but I felt like I was going uphill,\" she said. \"I was running at the side of the road, but I was still hitting those bump things. It wasn't like any part of me was hurting. But all of me was, if that makes sense. There wasn't any muscle or anything that seized up. I just couldn't keep going.\" </p> <p>Seeing Alemu go past had been the final blow. \"Emotionally, it kicks you in the guts. It did that when the two girls pulled away, too, but I'd got that back together and come through it. </p> <p>\"Physically, I knew I could do that. If I'd been running strongly when she [Alemu] came by me, I could have regrouped and got through that, too.\" </p> <p>As she stopped and looked back down the road, hands on her knees, her thoughts were divided between carrying on and finding a way of giving up. </p> <p>\"My mind didn't want to let go and give up on it,\" she said. \"There was support there, from people shouting at me to get going. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what the protocol was for just getting out of there.\" </p> <p>She tried to start again, but realised, for the first time in her life, that it was useless. \"You go through bad stages in every race, and definitely in a marathon, but not as bad as that. I've never felt before that I couldn't finish a race.\" </p> <p>Eventually, she was picked up and taken back to the stadium, where she met her husband, Gary Lough, and her parents. \"There's very little anyone can say to comfort you,\" she said. </p> <p>After a doctor had checked her over and could find nothing wrong, she was taken out of the stadium and driven back to the athletes' village. </p> <p>\"I was just in shock,\" she remembered yesterday. \"I was numb. I was almost unable to cry. I felt I'd let everyone else down. But nobody was hurting inside as much as I was.\" </p> <p>She is not counting on receiving a definitive solution to the mystery when the results of her tests come through. \"It's easier, I guess, to pick yourself up and do something about it if you know the reason,\" she said. \"But whether I'll find a reason, I don't know.\"</p> <p><b>Rocky road to the top</b> </p> <p><b>1973</b> Born December 17 in Northwich, Cheshire. </p> <p><b>1992</b> Comes to prominence by winning the world junior cross-country title in Boston, US.

  "In March 1969, after the Czechoslovakian ice hockey team defeated the Soviet Union 2-0, the streets of Prague filled with people chanting at their Soviet occupiers, \"You have tanks, we have goals.\" In such a context, Ivan Hlinka, who has died aged 54, had an importance comparable to that in England of Bobby Moore, Alf Ramsey and Denis Law combined. <p>As an ice hockey player, Hlinka led Czechoslovakia to their first world championship. As a coach, he took the Czech Republic to an Olympic gold medal in Nagano. Later, he became the first European to coach in the north American National Hockey League (NHL). </p> <p>Hlinka died in a car crash while returning to Prague from the spa town of Karlovy Vary, where he had gone to make sure that the Czech star Jaromir Jagr could take part in the World Cup tournament, which begins next Monday. Hlinka's feuding with Jagr was one of the reasons for his dismissal as coach of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins in 2001. Ironically, Herb Brooks, whom Hlinka succeeded as coach, died last year, also in a car crash (obituary, August 22 2003). </p> <p>Born in Most, near the German border, Hlinka began playing, at the age of 12, with the junior teams of CHZ Litvonov, the hotbed of Czech hockey. He made his senior debut aged 19 in 1969, and, apart from a brief spell with Dukla Trencen, played there until 1981, registering 848 points in 469 games. But his reputation was made as leader of the national team. With Canadian and American professionals barred from competition, \"amateur\" ice hockey was dominated by the Soviets. </p> <p>When the Czechs won their first world championship, in Prague in 1972, it was Hlinka who was credited with convincing his teammates they were capable of winning. He won two more world titles, in 1976 and 1977, but had to settle for Olympic bronze in 1972 and silver in 1976. </p> <p>However, in 1976, Czechoslovakia again shocked the hockey world by reaching the finals of the Canada Cup, the first \"open\" world tournament. Although they lost to the host Canadians 5-4 in the final, Hlinka was named as the tournament's outstanding forward, ahead of Guy LaFleur and Phil Esposito. </p> <p>At 6ft 2in and nearly 16st, Hlinka's style as a centre resembled Esposito's - difficult to move from the slot in front of the goal, although his skating and passing abilities reminded people more of the elegant Montreal Canadian centre Jean Beliveau. </p> <p>A number of Czechs had already played in a rival professional league, but, in 1981, Hlinka, past his prime, became one of the first in the NHL, playing two seasons for Vancouver Canucks; his 60 first-season points remains a team record for a rookie. He played two more seasons in Switzerland, before returning to Litvonov as coach in 1985. He became coach of the national Czech team just as it was weakened by the loss of Slovak players to their own, newly independent country. </p> <p>Hlinka's greatest triumph came in 1998, when, behind the outstanding goaltending of Dominik Hasek, the Czech Republic won in Nagano, the first Olympic tournament completely open to professionals. After coaching the Czech Republic to their second world title in 1999, Hlinka was hired as associate head coach in Pittsburgh by Brooks and general manager Craig Patrick, both of whom had competed against him as US Olympians. </p> <p>After a year understudying Brooks, Hlinka took over the Penguins in 2000, joining Chicago's Finnish coach Alpo Suhonen as the NHL's first European skippers. Boasting 15 European players, his team reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals, but he was fired after losing the first four games of the 2001-02 season. Player-owner Mario Lemieux blamed a lack of communication; Hlinka was unable to get the superstar Jagr to concentrate on playing defence. </p> <p>Hlinka spent two years resting after suffering heart problems, but again was hired by former rivals, spending one season as coach of Avantgard Omsk, in the Russian Premier League. At the 2004 world championships in Prague, he was named as the greatest figure in Czech hockey history. </p> <p>After the Czechs performed badly in that tournament, Hlinka was chosen to replace his former assistant, Slavimir Lener, as coach. With Hlinka's death, Vladimir Ruzicka, captain of the 1998 Olympic champions, is expected to take over. But no one can replace Hlinka's standing in the hearts of Czechs. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Libena and a son. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ivan Hlinka, hockey player and coach, born January 26 1950; died August 16 2004</p>",
