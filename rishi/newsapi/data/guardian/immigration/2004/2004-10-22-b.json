  "<p>Fifteen years ago a weekend escape from Britain's winter chill to watch Trinidad and Tobago play the United States in the last qualifying game for the 1990 World Cup seemed like a good idea at the time. Come to that, it still does. </p> <p>The immigration official in Port of Spain was deeply suspicious. What possible interest could an Englishman have in seeing who qualified from the Concacaf group for the final place at Italia '90? </p> <p>\"I see. You're a sports journalist ... and you work in England ... covering football.\" \"Yes.\" </p> <p>He seemed satisfied but still needed an answer to a question which was clearly bothering him: \"Tell me Mr Lacey, what is wrong with Manchester United ?\" </p> <p>Everything that goes around comes around. Then United lay low in the old First Division and no doubt Port of Spain immigration is again pondering a poor start to the season at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Manchester United will face Arsenal tomorrow not only 11 points behind the champions and Premier League leaders but showing few signs of being able to narrow the gap sufficiently to present a prima facie case for regaining the title. </p> <p>Even if Alex Ferguson's team beat Arsenal, denying them an undefeated half-century, the triumph will be fleeting unless United show serious signs of restoring the quality to their play which brought them seven Premier League titles in nine seasons as well as the powers of recovery which added an eighth two years later after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side had faltered. </p> <p>The best teams have lean periods but, by United's standards, a total of 14 points from the opening nine games with just nine goals scored is anorexic. Meanwhile, Arsenal have rubbed it in by taking 25 points out of a possible 27 and scoring 29 times. </p> <p>Manchester United, it is said, are in a period of transition but if by Christmas they have not begun to pick up, their critics will begin to wonder at what precise point does transition become decline. </p> <p>When a stressed Kenny Dalglish resigned the Liverpool managership just over halfway through the 1990-91 season he, too, was starting to turn the team around. Dalglish left Liverpool top of the table but they failed to retain the championship and have not regained it since. </p> <p>Dalglish had signed players who were plainly not good enough for Anfield: people like Glenn Hysen, Ronny Rosenthal and David Speedie. When Peter Schmeichel, the former Manchester United goalkeeper, remarked on BBC's Match of the Day last Saturday that certain members of Ferguson's side were \"not United players\" it was easy to see what he meant. </p> <p>The Manchester United manager may have made outstanding purchases in Ruud van Nistelrooy, Rio Ferdinand, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, the latter having cost him next summer's transfer budget. But the best players in the world will only enhance a team's fortunes if they come into a side with a settled chemistry. </p> <p>When building a football team bricks are nothing without mortar and Ferguson is still searching for mortar with the kind of consistency once supplied by the likes of Steve Bruce, Denis Irwin and, until recently, Nicky Butt. Hence all the changes: five for last Saturday's scoreless draw with Birmingham City then seven for Tuesday's Champions League game against Sparta Prague which produced another half-hearted, half-cock performance and, unsurprisingly, a similar result. </p> <p>Team changes by Ferguson are nothing new but whereas in the past he has been able to rotate his side from a position of strength, knowing that the replacements are more or less the equals of those left out, he is now trying to fill an inside straight and coming up with a busted flush. </p> <p>He can rearrange the midfield as much as he likes but, even with Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs still around, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Kleberson, a waning Roy Keane and tyros like Darren Fletcher and Liam Miller are not going to re-establish the sort of superiority between the penalty areas that United once enjoyed. </p> <p>Liverpool's best days were done once they started to give the ball away needlessly on a regular basis. Manchester United have not yet slid that far but if Arsenal are still passing and moving tomorrow with the pace, accuracy and imagination which have bewildered most of their opponents in the Premier League this season the contrast could be stark. </p> <p>Ferguson's attempts to reopen the sores of the ill-tempered climax to Arsenal's previous visit to Old Trafford are irrelevant now. Two of the Arsenal players involved, Martin Keown and Ray Parlour, have since left Highbury. </p> <p>It is a long time since United's need of a home win has been so urgent. Already Malcolm Glazer could be forgiven for wondering if he is not raising his stake in football's equivalent of the Queen Mary, now an American tourist attraction with its blue-riband days long gone.</p>",
  "After years of expectation, zero tolerance has finally arrived in Mexico City, promising to take on the chaos at the core of this vast metropolis: My money is on the chaos. <p>According to a new law, I and my fellow residents will now be hauled before a district judge if we shoot our guns into the sky, leave dog excrement on the street, dump furniture by the curb, or demand a tip for fire-eating at traffic lights. </p> <p>And that's just a tiny selection from the list of misdemeanours that should now, at least in theory, be punished with middling fines and up to 36 hours in jail. </p> <p>The Law of Civic Culture is one of the few identifiable consequences of the city's decision two years ago to seek help in tackling chronically high crime from former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani. </p> <p>While in the Mexican capital during the $4.3m (\u00a32.35m) consultancy, Mr Giuliani repeated his well-worn adages that cracking down on minor offences undermines an underlying culture of disrespect for the law, and so shuts down a major breeding ground of criminals. </p> <p>Could this belief be successfully adapted to a mega city in a developing country with major problems of poverty and unemployment and an apparently deep psychological attachment to its own frenetic disorder? </p> <p>Yes, the godfather of zero tolerance insisted. </p> <p>His team released 146 recommendations in August last year, all of which Mexico City's government promised to implement. </p> <p>A year later the new law, incorporating a sizeable batch of the recommendations, came into effect. </p> <p>Many here are only dimly aware that the law even exists and few notice any major impact on their lives. </p> <p>Perhaps the armies of squeegee men patrolling the city's crossroads are a little less likely to squirt detergent on your windscreen if you don't want it cleaned for the 10th time that day. </p> <p>Such unsolicited services constitute the highest profile infraction in the new law, with 363 people sanctioned in the first 10 weeks. But everything else looks pretty much the same, including the view from my third floor window in a scruffy but respectable corner of the inner city. </p> <p>The street stalls blocking the passage of pedestrians clearly couldn't care less about breaking article 25, section XIV. </p> <p>The men with red rags who are the de facto arbiters of who gets a parking space don't seem at all worried about flouting article 24, section I. </p> <p>They seem almost as carefree as the stumbling souls who relieve themselves on the trees, doubly guilty both for being drunk, and for failing to control their bladders in public. </p> <p>The policemen who regularly munch tacos at those same illegal stalls must be aware of the new law, but presumably see no reason to enforce it. </p> <p>Yet prostitutes are complaining that extortion by police, an age-old problem, has risen since the new law which gives officers increased powers to decide when selling sex on the street is a public nuisance. </p> <p>So three months into the experiment, zero tolerance Mexico City-style appears to be backfiring. </p> <p>A load of new rules to be happily broken by most, and exploited by some, can hardly have been what Mr Giuliani had in mind.</p>",
  "<p>The soundtrack to Rocky IV has rarely been acknowledged as a modern classic. But Jennifer Herrema, the former singer of the cult American sleazy rock band Royal Trux and now the leader of RTX, swears by it. \"A couple of weeks ago I was, like, on the couch watching the cable channel and Rocky IV came on,\" explains Herrema. Six feet tall, stick-thin, electric-blonde and shrouded in the pelts of various dead animals, Herrema makes an imposing presence. \"I had seen it before but its genius hadn't hit me. This time I was like: 'Oh my God. This is the best film ever.' So I called up my guitar player and told him to buy the soundtrack and get the artwork. Then Rocky III came on the television, and then Rocky IV was repeated, and now it's an obsession. I've been listening to the album solidly ever since.\"</p> <p>What's the appeal? \"I like champions. I used to be obsessed with [portly Buddhist martial arts star] Steven Seagal, and I love Mike Tyson - the fact that he keeps getting knocked out makes you feel for him, and he'll always be a champ to me. But I have to say that Sylvester Stallone is a bit classier than Seagal. The beginning sequence of Rocky IV features a Russian glove and an American glove smashing together, and that alone has changed my outlook on life. I live on the beach in California and I go surfing in the morning, then I drink one Red Bull after another, and I'm all about ways of increasing the adrenalin flow. So Rocky IV is, for now, my new drug.\"</p> <p>Drugs of a less wholesome kind have played a part in Herrema's life more than once. She was a 15-year-old schoolgirl in Washington DC in 1987 when she met Neil Hagerty, who became her boyfriend and band member for the next 13 years. As Royal Trux, the pair moved to New York, combined rock with free jazz and pure noise, and became heroin addicts. By the early 90s they had cleaned up and established themselves as the darlings of the American underground. Virgin Records, who hoped that the pair could be like the Rolling Stones for a new generation, picked them up for a three-album deal. Then Royal Trux made an album, 1997's Sweet Sixteen, considered to be so awful that Virgin paid them a third of a million dollars to not make any more records. The band split in 2000 after Herrema fell off the wagon when her father became terminally ill. Now Royal Trux have been acknowledged as one of the main influences for the new generation of rock bands that have come in their wake.</p> <p>\"When we split, we agreed that I would take the R, the T and the X from Royal Trux,\" says Herrema in a cigarette-matured croak. \"Neil got the O, the Y, the A, the L, the R and the U. Because we had been together for so long we got locked into a negative cycle with each other and we had to move on. We were a week in to an American tour when I found out that my dad was dying and I didn't deal with it well. I started doing drugs. Neil couldn't be around that, so we cancelled the tour and I got worse, but if things were right in my life I think I would have had another way to deal with my dad dying. Looking back, I can see that I was flipping over the card table by doing drugs again.\"</p> <p>The couple sold the ranch they shared in the Virginia countryside, Hagerty moved to New Mexico and Herrema moved to California. While Hagerty has gone on to make increasingly experimental solo records, Herrema's first album with RTX sounds like a multi-layered version of 70s and 80s rock like Journey and Lynyrd Skynyrd; exactly the kind of blue-collar American music that most alternative types hate. \"I'm doing a continuation of what I brought to Royal Trux, but without the influence of Neil,\" says Herrema. \"This is a more straightforward album than I could have ever made with him, but I met these two young guys living on the California beach who have been making music together since their childhood and I liked their enthusiasm and energy. I realised that whatever I did couldn't just be me, myself and I, so these guys were perfect to form a new band with. And they were, like, totally stoked.\"</p> <p>Herrema's tastes are rooted in the mainstream. \"I was listening to Lyrnyrd Skynyrd's Nothing Fancy for, like, an entire month,\" she says. \"I was listening to Blue Oyster Cult for another month. My favourite guitarist, apart from Neil, is Eddie Hazel from Funkadelic, who played on their album Maggot Brain. I recently went through a major ELO spazz-out: I would put on their Greatest Hits and everything was right with the world. It just kills me that ELO got to the core of perfect pop-rock.\" Given that Royal Trux were such a hip band beloved of alternative heroes like Sonic Youth and Primal Scream, Herrema's tastes might come as a surprise. \"Those dudes are very different to me,\" she claims. \"I don't claim an allegiance with any of my so-called contemporaries, not out of any kind of condescension but simply because we're in opposite head spaces. I can appreciate Sonic Youth, but I've always been much more inclined to listen to something athletic and straightforward. Like Lynyrd Skynyrd.\"</p> <p>This all stems, apparently, from her parents' record collection. \"They had great taste - Stones, Dylan, Fleetwood Mac, the Commodores, the Eagles - and I loved every record my parents had apart from one: the mellow pop duo Seals and Crofts. They were two dudes who were a bit similar to Simon &amp; Garfunkel and they made me very depressed as a kid. But in the car, on the way to school, I just wanted AM radio all the way. At high school I listened to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath with the stoners and that's what I grew up with; that's what I love. What can I say? All I ever want to hear is classic rock.\"</p>",
  "<p>Let's get the plug out of the way early doors, Shirley. You're working with BT to help London's bid for the 2012 Olympics - last Monday's parade can't have hurt, can it?<br> Definitely not! Not many people realise this, but one of things the IOC look for when awarding the games is public support. Having 25,000 people cheering us definitely helped. Another thing people can do is leave a message at <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com\"> www.london2012.com</a> - the vote will be taken next July, so do it now!</p> <p><strong>Rest assured, we'll be clicking that link, Shirley. Now Small Talk's far too much of a gentleman to tell the readers your age, but do you think you'll still be competing in 2012?</strong><br> Oh, it's a long way off [laughs]. I always say after each one that I'll never do it again - but it's really addictive and the thrill of competing in your home country, that's pretty cool.</p> <p><strong>Every Londoner's journey to work involves being crushed like a sardine on the tube with their nose stuck up someone's sweaty armpit. Surely that can't help our chances?</strong><br> Everyone brings up transport, but I've been to four Olympics and there have been problems beforehand in each venue. In Athens, for instance, the place was at absolute gridlock: they had no trains, a tiny airport, no trams, nothing - it was just absolutely terrible. Yet they turned it round. Trust me, London is in a much better position than the Greeks were.</p> <p><strong>Speaking of Athens, how many times have you been asked what yngling is since you won gold?</strong><br> [Laughs] Quite a lot. Although the newspapers did quite a good job explaining it. One thing I learned is that it's 12 points in scrabble.</p> <p><strong>And don't forget the possible 50-point bonus for using all your seven letters...</strong><br> [Silence]</p> <p><strong>Er, anyway, back to the Olympics: how has your life changed since Athens? Are you recognised on the streets of Cowes now?</strong><br> Well, I was recognised before at home, it's a small place. When I got back there was a big crowd waiting and it was very emotional: we arrived back at 3.15am and all the people who had helped me fundraise, all the people who had made me dinner when I was too tired to do it myself were there. It was the first time I cried after winning the gold medal.</p> <p><strong>What went through your mind on the medal rostrum?</strong><br> I just remembered all the hard times I'd been through and how it'd all been worth it. However the two girls with me were trying to remember the national anthem [laughs]. We'd already won gold with a race to go, so while everyone else was sticking it out for silver and bronze, we were at the health spa, getting our hair and nails done, and I was teaching the girls the national anthem. I think they did OK in the end!</p> <p><strong>We heard the Olympic village was something of a hotbed of tomfoolery with athletes getting up to all sorts. True or false?</strong><br> We didn't all stay in the same village, so I couldn't possibly comment! We certainly had a good time, though.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite TV show?</strong><br> I love Phoenix Nights, Peter Kay is the funniest man ever.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite John Smith ad?</strong><br> I love them all, but it's got to be 'Top bombing!' Although I like the one set in the Indian restaurant too.</p> <p><strong>What about music? What's the last CD you bought?</strong><br> [Thinks for ages] Er, er. This Irish guy. What's his name? </p> <p><strong>Daniel O'Donnell?</strong><br> No, no, he's a folk singer. Oh, [exasperated] I can't remember. I'm a big fan of iTunes though - 80s music in particular. Give me some Hue and Cry over that modern pop stuff any day.</p> <p><strong>What would you put in Room 101?</strong><br> I hate bad service. It drives me mad. It's everywhere, petrol stations, restaurants, bars, you name it. You can't even say hello before they are grabbing your credit card.</p> <p><strong>Indeed. What's the world coming to? Speaking of bars, what's your poison? An ice-cool Lambrini perhaps?</strong><br> Oh no, a proper bottle of Champagne will do me fine.</p> <p><strong>How much is a pint of milk?</strong><br> I don't know! Um, fifty pence?</p> <p><strong>Close enough, 40p</strong><br> Well, we pay more for things on the Isle of Wight.</p> <p><strong>Here's another tough one: Brad Pitt or Justin Timberlake?</strong><br> [PR man interrupts: I'm sorry but Shirley has to attend a webchat so she'll have to go now. Goodbye Small Talk].</p> <p>Ah. Right. Goodbye PR man. Goodbye Shirley.</p>",
  "A tale of prostitutes, old age, youthful beauty and the madness of love brought the Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez new critical acclaim yesterday as his first novel for a decade reached book shops in the Spanish-speaking world. <p>A million copies of Memories of My Melancholy Whores went on sale in Latin America and Spain, and the publishers celebrated, having outwitted the copyright pirates who have been selling a clandestine version in Colombia in recent days. </p> <p>Its editor, Braulio Peralta, told journalists in Mexico: \"Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez changed the last chapter.\" </p> <p>The book, described as a hymn to the renewing qualities of love and the rich possibilities of old age, has been lavished with praise by the critics. </p> <p>\"The prose of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is as brilliant as ever and, in the brevity of this novel, gains intensity,\" Rosa Mora wrote in the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds. </p> <p>\"The startling thing here is the profound nostalgia that floods the whole tale and in the deep melancholy that this 90-year-old man experiences at seeing a sleeping girl, described as 'a tender fighting bull,'\" the Colombian critic Conrado Zuluaga wrote. </p> <p>\"Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez destroys the biological clock that makes us old and, through his birthday protagonist, suggests that one's age is not what one has but what one feels,\" his fellow Colombian writer Jorge Franco said. </p> <p>\"The only unnecessary thing is the title, because the girls are almost never sad,\" the former Colombian culture minister Alberto Casas said. </p> <p>Its publishers, Random House Mondadori, described the 109-page novel as the story of an \"eccentric, solitary old man, a narrative of his sexual adventures ... for which he always paid, never imagining that this would be the way he would discover true love.\" </p> <p>Set in Colombia in the mid-1950s, it tells how an elderly journalist decides he must celebrate his 90th birthday by taking the virginity of a 14-year-old prostitute. But, when he is presented with the ideal candidate, she has been drugged by the brothel madam and refuses to wake up. </p> <p>In the end he spends the night admiring her youth and naked beauty while renouncing the opportunity to take her virginity and, to his surprise, falling in love for the first time in his life. </p> <p>For nights on end he observes, strokes, kisses, reads to, sings to and sleeps beside the always dormant object of what becomes a tormented, jealous, but life-giving, love. </p> <p>\"Sex is the consolation that you are left with when you do not attain love,\" he concludes, having kept a record of more than 500 prostitutes he has slept with. </p> <p>Now he finds that his mem ories are melancholy and the future has becomes full of terrible excitement, and realises that it is love, not old age, that will kill him. </p> <p>Turning ninety seems like an opportunity to \"flip myself over on the grill and starting cooking the other side for the next ninety years\". </p> <p>Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, The 76-year-old author of One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera appears to have beaten the book pirates without meaning to, by changing the last chapter for artistic reasons. </p> <p>\"There were some atmospheric feelings [in the chapter] that needed or required certain words to be exchanged for others,\" Mr Peralta said. </p> <p>Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's literary agent said last night that a British distributor for a potential English translation had not yet been found. </p> <p>Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1982, published a volume of autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale, last year. </p> <p>He plans to published a short novel, We'll See Each Other in August, soon, Mr Peralta said. </p> <p>Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has suffered from lymph cancer in recent years and makes few public appearances. </p> <p>\"It's a song to life. I think we all know what Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has gone through in the past few years,\" Mr Peralta said. </p> <p>\"We are all worried for his health.\" </p> <p>The protagonist of Memories of My Melancholy Whores is also concerned about his health, and his inevitable death, but concludes that the end will probably be sweet.</p>",
  "This morning, while walking to get my bagel, I notice that the street my hotel is on is full of stickers saying \"Drunk Drivers for Bush/Cheney\". But the best has to be a bumper sticker saying \"Somewhere in Texas, a village is missing its idiot\". <p>I was still sleepy, so it took a while to figure that one out - I am slow in the morning. Which worries me a bit, because my brain should be up and running in less than half an hour - I have an appointment with an \"Iraq expert\" at the National Defence university.</p> <p>When I get there, I need to show the guard a photo ID. I pull out my press pass, but he doesn't like it. He wants to see my passport, and we all know how much I hate that. He looks at it and says, \"Oh, Airakian!\". I worry that my brain is still not up to speed - I am just getting used to \"Airaki\" with the big Ai at the beginning, and this was another variation - you have to admit it is very creative. I am given directions and allowed to walk in unescorted which, surprised me a bit - it is the National Defence university, after all.</p> <p>I feel like I have just stepped into a war movie set. This is the beginning, where they are still being trained. It is the scene where you get to see the main character amongst his colleagues who will be saved by the brave hero later in the movie. Red brick two storey buildings and big green squares with young officers marching in formation and joggers in white t-shirts saying \"good morning\" when they hop by. I am so out of place here: ET really needs to go home.</p> <p>While waiting for Judith Yaphe to come down and sign me in, I see a quote in huge letters on the wall \"We are concerned with the peace of the entire world, and the peace can only be maintained by the strong\" - Gen George C Marshall. Oh dear - I don't know if I am going to like this. But the moment she shows up, I know we are going get along just fine - she looks exactly like my French teacher from middle school in Baghdad. She has the same comforting presence.</p> <p>As a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the university, Japhe has been \"doing Iraq for the last 30 years\". And my guess is if you do someone for so long you must know them pretty well, especially when you were doing them for \"the agency\". We go up to her office, which is reassuringly chaotic. When I walk into an office that is too organised, I start panicking. </p> <p>She is wearing a necklace holding a little pendant, which has \"Allah\" written in Arabic, and another one with Hebrew lettering. The cord holding her office badge had \"Mission: Baghdad\" printed on it, sending signals in all directions. I was offered a warm coke - the full sugar feast, not the wimpy diet thing.</p> <p>She tells me that she has written her PhD thesis on the 1920 Iraqi revolt against the British occupiers at the time, and thinks there are some similarities between then and now - but does anyone want to learn? She doesn't think so. \"Here is what the British did. And here are the mistakes. Why do you repeat them? You don't set up a false front democracy, you don't set up buildings and institutions and then deny them power. You can't engineer, stage-manage and hold phoney elections. And you are also writing their constitution? Oh, OK.\"</p> <p>\"The lack of knowledge about Iraq among the people making decisions here is appalling\", she says. When it came to the time to go for war, the administration fully believed that it was going to be a short conflict, the Americans would be welcomed with flowers, and everything would be fine. </p> <p>\"If you believe that, and you want to do War-Lite, then you won't plan enough. Is that stupid? Yes, I would say it is stupid.\"</p> <p>But there was another possibility; in a parallel universe where the Pentagon did not take over, Ahmad Chalabi didn't exist, and the Bush administration did listen to people like Yaphe, there might be an Iraq that managed to get out of the mess of war with less damage. But we will never know.</p> <p>Back in this universe, \"the greatest democracy on this earth\" is holding elections in a couple of days. They are presidential elections which will have far wider consequences than just in the US - if you buy into Yaphe's worst case scenario and live in the Middle East, I suggest you start stocking up. \"My worst case scenario is that Bush gets re-elected and the people that did Iraq come back and decide to continue with their mission, which is to do terrible things\".</p> <p>I still wanted to ask her what she thought of Iran, and about elections in Iraq, but our time is up. She asks me whether my real name is Salam, and when I tell her my last name, the name of the tribe, she recognises it. I am left thinking: \"She knows - she really has been doing Iraq for 30 years\"</p> <p>Later ... I wait for five minutes outside the gates of the National Defence university, but not a single cab drives by. I decide to walk. Bad decision. Apparently, the university is located very close to what is probably Washington's Sadr City. I realise I have all the wrong instincts, I do not know what the bad or good signs are - it just looks very poor and, just like in Sadr City, lots of men who seem to have nothing to do stand at street corners.</p> <p>I remember having an argument with a taxi driver in Baghdad some time ago. He was totally convinced that there is no such thing as a poor American - they were all rich. Come take a look at this, habibi. It gets worse, Allah decides to drain his swimming pool and it starts raining. I realise I have forgotten the piece of paper with the address for my next appointment. I pray David Kay is not the punctual type.</p> <p>Kay agreed to meet me for lunch at a place of my choice. All I know is the bagel place near the hotel. I call a Guardian correspondent here in DC for help and she suggests I go to the Palm. \"It is a place men like to go to.\" She has no idea how intimidating this sounds to me - what is a place men like to go to? And what if I don't like it - will my membership card to the male species be withdrawn? </p> <p>The insecurities this sentence brought up: well, we don't want to go there. After a couple of ahhhs and ummms from me, she adds, \"Salam, it is not a strip joint\".</p> <p>When I get back to the hotel to pick up the address, I still have some time to check the restaurant's website. \"The spot for negotiating and deal-making over a juicy steak and an infamous Palm martini. It's not only politicians that make their way to the Washington Palm - Larry King and Tim Russert can be seen among the hordes of loyal Palm customers.\" </p> <p>Yup. Not a strip joint. When I get there, I am led past the nice tables near the windows to a small table in the back. Obviously, I should have said that I am internet celebrity Salam Pax, and I want to sit near Larry King. The place is very noisy and the waiters wear white aprons, making them look like medical assistants in a dental clinic. </p> <p>The first thing Dr David Kay says when he arrives is that this is the perfect place for an intimate conversation -- no one can ever hear what you are saying. We don't have the \"infamous martinis\" - he has an iced tea and I have a cola.</p> <p>The first time Kay was in Baghdad was back in 1992, heading the Unscom's nuclear weapons inspection team. Most recently, he was sent to Baghdad as chief weapons inspector for the Iraq Survey Group, which was dispatched to Iraq by the US to clarify the whole question of whether there were WMD there. </p> <p>He came back to Washington saying that he did not find \"large stockpiles of newly produced weapons of mass destruction\", blowing away the main argument that justified the war on Iraq: Saddam and his deadly arsenal of WMD.</p> <p>Although Kay has been quite often to Baghdad, he never met Saddam or his (late) sons. But because he was the head of the UN inspection team, he was constantly escorted by 10 Iraqi minders - warm Iraqi hospitality, courtesy of Saddam. While Kay was in Baghdad for the ISG inspections, he got to meet Tariq Aziz, Iraq's ex-minister of foreign affairs, now in custody. </p> <p>Aziz described a Saddam who was not as the rest of the world pictured him, but closer to the reality we Iraqis knew. \"He was only interested in self enrichment and staying in power. [Aziz] talked about Saddam sending him manuscripts for novels he was writing.\" </p> <p>Yes that sounds like the Saddam of the last couple of years, before this war. Reality came to him filtered through his aides. He was more interested in building palaces and monuments than fighting a war or planning terrorist attacks. I mean, one day the guy has a dream, and the next day he holds a meeting that's broadcast on TV in which he wants artists to interpret this dream as a sculpture to adorn one of the public squares in Baghdad. The dream? Dogs are running after him and he kills one of them. Seriously.</p> <p>What Kay found was a corrupt system in which scientists would exaggerate about what they were doing to get loads of money from Saddam. The scientists bluffed Saddam, and Saddam bluffed the world.</p> <p>So what does the man who started his statement to a US Senate committee with the words \"it turns out we were all wrong\" think about the war and the reasons it was fought? </p> <p>\"What I worry about is that, years from now, we will have an Iraqi historian who will say: 'The only reason the US and UK went to war was for oil, WMD and Israel. They never cared about what Saddam did to Iraqis.' That is what we should have done. It does not matter whether he had the weapons. Saddam was destroying society.\"</p> <p>We talk for a long time about the changes in Iraq, about the green zone and soldiers having to police traffic in the chaotic streets of Baghdad. He tells me how he watched sentiments change in Baghdad by how the Iraqi children and US soldiers interacted. </p> <p>We have coffee, and he asks what life is like these days in Baghdad, and what people think of our new prime minister, Ayad Allawi. I stopped taking notes some time ago - you can't have a conversation when you have to constantly write things down. But it is past three, and Dr Kay has to go.</p> <p>I tell you, this trip has been creating more confusion than answers. I spend the rest of the afternoon in a place which is much easier to deal with - the alphabetised aisles of a record store (result: the Peter Malick Group featuring Norah Jones).</p>",
  "I really don't like my passport: it is too big and has a colour that reminds you of something that has been sitting for too long in your fridge. But what I hate most about it is that when an immigration officer takes a look at it they will usually ask me to step aside and follow them into a small room. <p>Everybody in the airport immigration queue at JFK in New York already hates me because it is taking too long, and now that I am being led away like this it makes everyone look at me as if I have just threatened to assassinate their favourite cartoon character.</p> <p>This is the moment where, in a perfect world modelled on Bollywood movies, I would break into song and dance; my chorus boys would be the beautiful boys in turbans and beards brandishing their \"axis of evil\" passports and I would look as fabulous as Kylie Minogue while singing: \"What do I have to do to get the message thru? I am Iraqi, Iraqi!\" It would be a hit with everyone at the airport and I would be escorted by adoring fans to the limousine waiting outside</p> <p>But this is not a Bollywood movie and I am being taken to a \"secondary screening\". My first visit to the USA might just end up with me being shackled and sent to a very unpleasant place where the colour orange is the height of fashion.</p> <p>Mind you, a friendly soul at this paper's office did offer comforting words: if I ever did end up in Guant\u00e1namo Bay they would just change my title to the Guant\u00e1namo Blogger, he said, promising that they would still be interested. Thanks. My only worry is, I don't think orange is a colour that suits my complexion.</p> <p>The immigration officer led me to a room on the side where four officers were sitting on a very high podium joking about some guy they didn't like, and one of them was shouting, \"Deport him, deport him!\" </p> <p>I smile: it's tough trying not to look nervous when you are in front of a panel of four archangels who will decide whether you deserve to enter paradise. I am handed a piece of paper to fill out. I am relieved it does not ask me to list my sins on this earth. Meanwhile, more non-whiteys are arriving and filling out forms. I feel a bit more relaxed among my fellow exiles from the ranks of normal people. We are special: we are all from Muslim countries.</p> <p>When my turn comes to step up to the podium for the archangels to question my reasons for entering this land of dreams, this heaven on earth, I get asked a question that will trouble me for a long time after the interview is over: \"Sir, are you religious?\" </p> <p>Now, I am the type of Muslim who would tell you that even if there was an Allah hovering up there, he should be punished by collective disobedience because he has been doing a miserable job. </p> <p>So the answer to Mr Immigration Officer would be a hearty: \"Oh, no. I dropped that potato a long time ago.\" But instead I keep looking at the little cross hanging from his neck and feel like telling him that this is none of his business. But I don't. We all know why he is asking me this question and what my answer should be: \"No, sir, I am not religious and I do not know how to prove that to you.\" I feel ashamed that I have just said these words.</p> <p>No time to dwell on that. I have another flight to catch to Washington and I am so tired I will fall asleep standing if I don't keep moving. I vaguely remember staring for too long at a huge wall full of magazines and newspapers and wondering: who has the time to read all that? I bought everything that had the word Iraq on the cover.</p> <p>Next thing, I am standing in line to board a small plane to Washington DC. There is something strangely familiar in this setup; I am just not sure what it is until I am asked to spread my legs and lift my arms. By Allah, this is like going into the green zone in Baghdad, only everyone is so friendly. That's what is different: they smile and say, \"Have a nice day\" after they pat you down, but it is the basic green zone experience. Kind of makes you homesick. </p> <p>On the flight we are instructed not to stand up from our seats once we get within 30 minutes of Washington; otherwise we will not be allowed to land. Too much weirdness, and I haven't even landed yet. I fall asleep in the taxi to the hotel, in Georgetown.</p> <p>Day one</p> <p>First thought this morning was: what am I doing here? Why am I in Washington? If word gets out I will end up on two wanted lists: my cousins', because they will all want presents from DC, and the list of my friendly neighbourhood kidnap gang back in Baghdad. If you ask their opinion, I am at the heart of darkness; I am Halal meat; head does not belong where it is now and all that. </p> <p>I have no plan. My \"to do\" list has only two items on it: 1. Panic. 2. Think about food. (The first does not rule out the second under Pax logic.) There is enough time for the first item, but I wake up too late for breakfast in the hotel and I have to go out. I get myself a kids' tourist map (the only one they had at the hotel: the treasury department is an Uncle Sam throwing money around) and go to the nearest bagel place. I am officially a bagel fan now.</p> <p>My big bagel is full of eggs that come out of a milk carton (I kid you not - and already beaten, too. They must have such clever hens here. I am flabbergasted) and smoked bacon. (All future immigration officers are to refer to this: I am not religious - I eat forbidden meat). </p> <p>Munching on this feast of strange and forbidden food I decide to do a pilgrimage to the White House, taking my cues from a religion I have betrayed publicly just so that I can get into this land; to walk around this shrine to freedom and democracy seven times, kiss the black stone, then throw seven stones at the pillar of evil and run between the two mounds of Safa and Marwa seven times, the whole thing minus the white robe but plus baseball cap. There was one small detour: my map showed a place called Foggy Bottom - and I had to see what a foggy bottom looked like.</p> <p>It didn't work out as well as I thought it would. To start with, the Foggy Bottom detour was a waste of time. It seems the gods here don't think much of circumambulation rituals: you can't walk around the White House. So I just stood there and gawked. </p> <p>While I was meditating on the whiteness of the White House, four American soldiers wearing desert fatigues came and joined the gawkers, and the only thing I could think of was how much I missed home. I mean, how sad is that: I see soldiers in combat fatigues and go all gooey, like ET wanting to go home. No prizes for identifying what's wrong with this picture.</p> <p>Since walking around the White house was out of the question, I thought maybe I'd go inside to find a black stone to kiss, the next step in this, my pilgrimage to the capital that wants to bring freedom and democracy to the malnourished, undereducated third world. </p> <p>I locate a guard and ask about White House tours. She tells me these have to be arranged through my senator. Oh, shucks. Now, how am I going to get in touch with John D Negroponte all the way back in the US ambassador's dugout in Baghdad?</p> <p>Throwing stones at the pillar of evil also had to be abandoned because I don't think anyone here will find an Iraqi throwing seven pebbles at the Washington Monument amusing. Only one ritual remains; running between the Safa and Marwa mounds. The Mall seems the place to do that, and I finally get a sign: the ground is spattered with Run Against Bush stickers. So what else to do but run?</p> <p>Later</p> <p>Tonight is the last presidential debate and the New York Yankees are playing against the Boston Red Sox, which is probably equally important. I was invited to watch both with a group of young Democrats. I was promised red wine, crunchy munchies and a crash course in baseball and the art of presidential debates - two reasons why America is such a great nation, I am told. </p> <p>Two TVs ensured that you missed nothing, and a big bowl of lollipops ensured the sugar levels stayed high. There was so much juicy gossip it was hard to pay much attention to the debate. Did you hear the one about George Bush being intimate with Condoleezza Rice? Apparently she has told some reporter she really enjoys solving crossword puzzles with the president. Wink wink, nudge nudge.</p> <p>Ultimately, the conversation turns to Iraq. We all seem to agree that even if John Kerry gets elected as president it is too late for a drastic change in policy. I am surprised at how much everyone here seems to have bought what the Bush administration has been selling them - especially the line about a well-educated Iraqi middle class that will take over and transform Iraq into a democratic paradise. </p> <p>To tell you the truth, I bought into that as well - and boy were we wrong. That educated middle class was everywhere around the world, but not in Iraq. What it decided to do was to shut its mouth or turn religious. </p> <p>And that is another thing that seemed to be incomprehensible to one of my new Washington friends: when we were talking about the popularity of the clerical militia chief Moqtada al-Sadr I was asked how anyone could be fooled by someone who so obviously used religion to boost his own popularity and went for the lowest common denominator for popular appeal? I was saved by another guest who asked if we were talking about Bush or Sadr here.</p> <p>So how did the crash course in baseball and presidential debate go? Baseball: you hit the ball and run. Politics: never admit you made a mistake, so . . . hit the ball and run, I guess.</p>"
