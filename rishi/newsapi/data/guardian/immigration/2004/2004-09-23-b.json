  "<p>Richmond Foods says the proposed closure of its ice cream factory in Devon could lead to 175 job losses. The closure of the plant at Ivybridge, near Plymouth, next year is part of a plan to cut operating costs, expand capacity and invest in new machinery. </p> <p>Chief executive James Lambert said yesterday that much of the machinery at the factory, acquired from Associated British Foods, was more than 25 years old. Production would be transferred to sites in Richmond in North Yorkshire, Leeds and Wigan, which have space for new machinery. </p> <p>In a trading update, Richmond said full-year profits were likely to be about \u00a314m and it had increased its market share, scotching fears that profitability had suffered from a supermarket price war and poor summer weather. </p> <p>Investors have been jittery since consumer products group Unilever warned this week that profits would miss expectations because of weak ice cream sales.</p>",

  "Alan Crompton-Batt, who has died aged 50 of pneumonia, burned brightly in the world of London restaurants. Within the much-maligned profession of public relations, he stood out as an exciting, generous and passionate force for enjoyment and improvement. Restaurants to him were the playgrounds that a somewhat bleak childhood did not provide. <p>The only son of a notably courageous RAF pilot, Alan was born and educated first in Salisbury, and then, from the age of 11 to 15, at boarding school in Penang, where his father had been stationed. It was Singaporean cooking that ignited his love for good food and, to the end of his life, meals in the posh restaurants of his famed clients were punctuated by plates of nasi-goreng in Soho's Malaysian outlets. </p> <p>Plans to take up a place at Oxford University were interrupted by the painful death of his father, from cancer. It was the era of punk rock, and Alan went into the music business, managing a band called Psychedelic Furs. Tiring of listening to the musicians' moans and, surprisingly, disapproving of their excesses, he wrote to Egon Ronay in 1978 asking for a position as an inspector for the great gourmet's hotel and restaurant guides. </p> <p>Eating out with Alan persuaded Ronay that he should ignore the usual requirements for the job, and hire him. In doing so, Ronay let loose a dynamo who thought nothing of driving the length of Britain between hotel breakfast and restaurant dinner - with a couple of lunches and an assignation in between. </p> <p>Another Ronay inspector at the time was Simon Hopkinson. The two became friends and shared a flat in West Hampstead, where Alan managed to run a mini-cab service and teach what might now be called cognitive behaviour therapy in the gaps between travelling and writing restaurant reports. </p> <p>When, later, he joined the restaurant company Kennedy-Brookes, he persuaded Hopkinson to return to his former profession as chef, and cook at Hilaire, a South Kensington restaurant previously called Brookes. Caroline and Terence Conran ate at Hilaire, and took Hopkinson off to open Bibendum, their restaurant in the former Michelin head quarters building. This was an early instance of Alan recognising, nurturing and celebrating gastronomic talent. </p> <p>One of his inspections for Ronay had been Nico Ladenis' Chez Nico, in Dulwich, south London; he recommended that the restaurant be awarded a star. When Alan left Kennedy-Brookes to set up Alan Crompton-Batt PR (ACBPR), Nico, who had decided to move his restaurant to Shinfield, near Reading, was one of his first clients. </p> <p>Another was the American Bill Blackburn, who had founded the New England Ice Cream company, one of the first few to show the English that ice cream could be cultural not chemical. It was Alan's idea to set up the Ice Cream Academy, whose illustrious members (his friends) were delighted to receive regular consignments of the product's varieties. </p> <p>Alan's espousal of the difficult Nico, with whom he collaborated on Nico's bestselling My Gastronomy (1987), and his unshakeable belief in the talents of Marco Pierre White, framed a career that included guiding and illuminating the Chinese Zen group and the Indian restaurant Tamarind, as well as helping set up restaurants like Robert Earl's Cajun-themed 51-51, the late Neal Grossman's Columbus and Christopher Gilmour's restaurant Christopher's - all of which showed his affection for the US, where he often thought he would be happier living. </p> <p>The mid-1980s was the heyday of ACBPR. Surrounded by bright and beautiful young assistants, christened by the press the Battettes, Alan dyed his hair blonder, wore it longer, dressed in glad rags and drove a white BMW in a sometimes wobbly line from appointment to appointment. Food and wine journalists loved him. Taking a group to show them the finer points of Champagne Taittinger, he put them up in the Taittinger-owned Hotel Crillon in Paris, on the faultless grounds that it was more fun than going to a winery. </p> <p>Alan's prodigious energy was a nuclear reactor into which restaurant critics plugged. His extraordinary memory was better than any electronic search engine: every meal was remembered; every glass savoured in recollection; and if you needed the lyrics of a pop song, the line-up of a Manchester United match, the best author of contemporary crime fiction or the outcome of a Napoleonic battle, he was your man. </p> <p>The bottle got the better of him, but he put up one of the most spirited fights I have observed. He is survived by his mother Yvonne and his former wife Elizabeth, who was quite the best thing to happen to him in his too short life.</p> <p>\u0095 Alan Richard Crompton-Batt, public relations consultant, born March 23 1954; died September 21 2004</p>",
  "The American poet Michael Donaghy, who has died suddenly aged 50, was a New Yorker who had made his home in London. He was a leading figure in the richly talented generation of poets who emerged in the 1980s, as well as an Irish traditional musician of repute. <p>Donaghy was born into an Irish family and grew up in the Bronx. He studied at Fordham University and the University of Chicago, where he edited the Chicago Review and founded the acclaimed Irish music ensemble Samradh Music. In 1985, he moved to London to join his partner and fellow musician Maddy Paxman, whom he married in 2003. </p> <p>Rapidly establishing himself on the poetry scene, he published his first full collection, Shibboleth, in 1988. Errata followed in 1993, and Conjure in 2000. Recognition came in the form of the Geoffrey Faber and Cholmondeley awards and the Whitbread and Forward prizes, among others. He also continued to play in various Irish music groups, as well as the early line-up of Lammas, the innovative jazz/traditional crossover band led by Tim Garland and the poet Don Paterson. </p> <p>Donaghy was a learned poet, with large resources of reading in science and music as well as literature. He can be seen in a line of descent from scholarly American formalists like Richard Wilbur and Anthony Hecht, but his gift for dramatic immediacy, and his crossing of mandarin and vernacular language, enabled his work to avoid the academicism that sometimes afflicts the recent generation of American so-called new formalists, with whom he was never truly aligned. </p> <p>An early reviewer described Donaghy as \"a streetwise don\", which suggests something of the startling wit and ingenuity with which he explored a metaphysical poet's taste for paradox as an instrument of seduction: \"So much is chance,/ So much agility, desire, and feverish care,/ As bicyclists and harpsichordists prove/ Who only by moving can balance,/ only by balancing move.\" (Machines). </p> <p>More than one contemporary poet could display such cleverness (it was a smart generation); few, though, could achieve the emotional weight that Donaghy's work gradually disclosed, or the lyric directness of the late poems. He specialised in richly furnished monologues, whose narrators are not so much untrustworthy as vertiginously unmoored from certainty. \"Smith\", for example, must invent an identity during lovemaking, \"[forging] a thing unalterable as iron\". </p> <p>A beguiling playfulness serves to emphasise the depths of anxiety and melancholia over which Donaghy's superb ear leads us - feelings perhaps rooted in Catholicism. He retains the Catholic sense of scale and labyrinthine ingenuity; in City Of God, a mad, failed priest, obsessed with the medieval memory arts, believes \"the mind inside the cathedral inside the mind/ could find the secret order of the world/ and remember every drop on every face/ in every summer thunderstorm.\" </p> <p>Later, in the shocking Black Ice And Rain, from Conjure, even the consolations of such an imagined order are removed, as the narrator pitilessly passes on his dreadful tale of friendship and catastrophe to an unsuspecting party guest. </p> <p>The birth, in 1996, of their son Ruairi was a great joy to Maddy and Michael. Michael was a devoted father, and the presence of Ruairi seems to have lent the poems a new richness and intimacy. Conjure closes with Haunts, addressed to his son as though in the far future, but also spoken \"here, alive, one Christmas long ago,/ when you were three, upstairs asleep\", a final, deeply moving paradox in which, as tradition requires, the poem escapes the constraints of time. </p> <p>In the literary world, Donaghy was widely loved for his natural charm, kindness, courtesy and humour, as well as for his enduringly boyish good looks. He was a wonderful - at times, uproarious - companion, mischievously delighted by human absurdity, especially the folie de grandeur of critics, editors and avant-gardistes. </p> <p>An acute critic himself, he published little, but his 1999 monograph Wallflowers showed a rigorous and original mind at work. He was also an inspiring teacher, whose classes, at the City University and Birkbeck College, London, encouraged a number of acclaimed poets, among them Paul Farley and John Stammers. </p> <p>Donaghy's concern for poetry as art, rather than mere self-expression, was apparent in every aspect of his work, not least in his legendary public readings. In 2001, when we did a national tour together for the Poetry Book Society, night after night Michael would perform, spellbindingly from memory. </p> <p>A particular highlight was his rendering of Keats's Ode To Melancholy (\"No, no, go not to Lethe\"), which threw a bridge across the division between poetry on the page and in performance, without sacrificing an iota of seriousness. Poetry in recent times has had few finer advocates or practitioners. He will come to be seen as one of the representative poets of the age. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Michael Donaghy, poet and musician, born May 24 1954; died September 16 2004</p>",
  "It's three party British politics. <p>That's been the real lesson of this year.</p> <p>Take those local elections.</p> <p>Big Liberal Democrat gains.</p> <p>Taking on and trouncing Labour in places like Cardiff and Cambridge, Liverpool and Newcastle;</p> <p>Making big gains from them in Leeds and Manchester as well.</p> <p>While in most of these places the Conservatives just simply disappeared.</p> <p>You know it is telling indeed that the voters did not think it worthwhile electing a single Conservative councillor in a place like Oxford.</p> <p>And if you take Scotland and Wales into account and they're scarcely a national UK political party any longer.</p> <p>And Liberal Democrats continued making gains from the Conservatives in places like Portsmouth, St Albans and Watford.</p> <p>In his first speech as the new Liberal Democrat Leader in Newcastle - after thirty years of one party Labour rule - this is what Peter Arnold had to say: -</p> <p>\"For Newcastle Liberal Democrats, one of the most important success criteria will be the extent to which we are able to give the city back to the people...We will be doing things differently, by making sure the Council is less politically partisan and more inclusive. We will be offering Opposition Groups the opportunity to adopt a more positive role in the council's affairs.\"</p> <p>Now there's the difference for you - in a nutshell.</p> <p>As that onetime Liberal, Winston Churchill, put it: \"In victory - magnanimity.\"</p> <p>That's the breath of fresh air that we bring to British politics - and to local communities with it.</p> <p>That's why we're on the move.</p> <p>And that's why we pushed Labour into third place for the first time ever in a national election.</p> <p>Add to those the European elections results.</p> <p>We stuck firmly to our reforming pro-European principles.</p> <p>And the outcome?</p> <p>Two more Liberal Democrat Members of the European Parliament. </p> <p>Fiona Hall in the North East.</p> <p>And Saj Karim in the North West.</p> <p>Saj - our first ever elected Liberal Democrat parliamentarian from an ethnic minority community.</p> <p>And about time too.</p> <p>But not unique for long.</p> <p>In Leicester South - just as in Brent East last year - we leapfrogged the Conservatives - we came from third place to take on Labour and win.</p> <p>Congratulations, Parmjit Gill.</p> <p>And never forget we came within an ace of doing the same in Birmingham Hodge Hill as well.</p> <p>Well done, Nicola Davies.</p> <p>So fantastic results. Each and every one.</p> <p>And when you leave Bournemouth make sure that your next stop is Hartlepool.</p> <p>That's where I'm heading next.</p> <p>Immediately after this speech.</p> <p>Lembit Opik is flying me there.</p> <p>I kid you not.</p> <p>Greater love hath no man for our party than his is prepared to place his life in Lembit's safe keeping in the skies above us.</p> <p>So I expect to see you all there in Hartlepool. Well, I really do hope to see you all there in Hartlepool!</p> <p>We are the challengers.</p> <p>The Conservatives have already conceded they aren't in the Hartlepool race. </p> <p>And it's a simple statement of fact that the Conservatives are now out of the race in most of urban Britain. </p> <p>And that the only effective challenge to Labour is coming from the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>People know we've done it before - and we can do it again in Hartlepool.</p> <p>If we go out there and make our case - make no mistake.</p> <p>We CAN do it. </p> <p>I want to talk to you today about the future.</p> <p>The future of two things.</p> <p>The future of our party.</p> <p>And also the future of our country.</p> <p>We want the two increasingly to go hand in hand.</p> <p>We know we can make the political weather - tuition fees, the council tax.</p> <p>And we know we're capable of much more yet.</p> <p>But our success also poses certain questions - and rightly so. </p> <p>Are these people up to it?</p> <p>Are those Liberal Democrats ready for the task in hand?</p> <p>Can we be sure we know what they stand for?</p> <p>Well we stand for three things above all else.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust. </p> <p>Those are our watchwords.</p> <p>Those are the core principles against which our policies must be measured. </p> <p>And they are the principles which match the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st century Britain.</p> <p>A Britain now of many faiths, many colours, many languages;<br> A variety of family structures; <br> Far greater life expectancy. <br> And working patterns our grandparents would scarcely recognise. <br>Social mobility and fast communications; High aspirations and far less deference; <br>Openness and tolerance about sexual orientation.</p> <p>A Britain where the individual counts for so much </p> <p>But still a Britain where a sense of community matters. </p> <p>In so many ways that's a liberal Britain.</p> <p>It's our task now to turn these instinctively liberal attitudes into positive votes for the party of British liberal democracy.</p> <p>And it is also a Britain in which the way we are governed is being transformed. </p> <p>We have a Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales, both elected by fairer votes - involving proportional representation.</p> <p>And -on November 4th people in the North East will have a referendum for a regional assembly. We're out campaigning hard for that - and I'll be back on that campaign trail again shortly.</p> <p>Devolution is at its best when it gets things done. And it's getting things done that show people what we value and what we stand for.</p> <p>It's been a big responsibility for us, in Wales, where we helped bring much needed stability to the Assembly at a crucial moment - and better policies as a result.</p> <p>Reduced class sizes; more environmental initiatives; free school milk; Free admission to art galleries and museums, recognising that the legacy and the vitality of Celtic culture demands the decision-makers to understand not just the price of things but also the value of things.</p> <p>As a result - people know more about what we stand for. And they're voting accordingly.</p> <p>Impressive gains this year in Cardiff, Bridgend and Swansea - and so many other places across the country.</p> <p>And in Wales we carry on pushing for an extension to the law making powers of the Assembly - that has to be the next logical and necessary step forward.</p> <p>And in Scotland where the partnership there has been delivering on many of our top priorities;</p> <p>Free personal care for the elderly - delivered.</p> <p>Abolishing tuition fees - delivered.</p> <p>Fair votes for local government elections - being delivered. </p> <p>But it doesn't stop there.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland have set the new agenda for devolution. </p> <p>A Scottish agenda that deals with long-term challenges - like poor health; the environment; the need to improve education, the foundation for an enterprising country.</p> <p>New legislation announced by Jim Wallace just this month to provide free eye and dental checks for all.</p> <p>And a new Environment Bill announced by Ross Finnie so that a green thread runs through the heart of Scottish government, one where every policy will be audited for its environmental impact.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats getting things done. </p> <p>And demonstrating how our approach - every time - is rooted in freedom, fairness and trust. </p> <p>I've done a lot of travelling across Britain this year.</p> <p>And with it a lot of listening.</p> <p>I listened to the students on campus in Plymouth, worried about their steadily deepening debts and how on earth they would ever escape them.</p> <p>I listened to the young mother in a Leicester shop, troubled that teachers are not getting the time to teach her children properly.</p> <p>I listened to the Asian grandmother in Huddersfield, who told me about being genuinely afraid, for the first time in over thirty years in her local community, because of the growth of mindless racism among an unrepresentative few.</p> <p>And then the high street traders in Birmingham, utterly sick and tired of senseless vandalism against their properties.</p> <p>And their local customers, equally scared about street violence and the threat of crime as it affects them personally.</p> <p>The pensioners in Exeter - bitter about their dwindling resources, confused about losing their pension books, unhappy about the level of pensions themselves and angry about seemingly never-ending council tax rises.</p> <p>And to the doctor in Norwich, expressing his sheer frustration at the remote, command and control from London which characterises so much of this government's mismanagement of our National Health Service.</p> <p>And then the school pupils in Cardiff, thinking aloud about pollution and climate change - uncertain about the environment they would inherit.</p> <p>This is our Britain today; these are typical of people's concerns.</p> <p>Well, if you seek to lead, first you must listen.</p> <p>People have a huge desire to be listened to; for politicians to take the time to understand their problems.</p> <p>And address those problems with solutions.</p> <p>It is we Liberal Democrats that are now providing the answers.</p> <p>For students - when the pupil aspires to become the student, we would encourage and enable them - by stopping tuition fees and axing top-up fees - one of the most socially retrograde acts of this government, when what Britain needs is a university system affordable to all.</p> <p>For parents - we will equip children for life - because children well cared for and well taught in their early years have a far better chance of success.</p> <p>So we will reduce class sizes for the youngest children and give teachers time to teach and children time to learn by abolishing unnecessary tests and red tape.</p> <p>And we would ensure that every child, in every classroom, in every school is taught by a qualified teacher in the relevant subject.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For those in fear of racism - first, a real lead from politicians - celebrating the fact that our country is better, it's richer and more diverse, precisely because it is a multicultural society.</p> <p>And that we have been prepared to stand out and if necessary alone in having no truck with short-term, knee-jerk responses to complex social issues.</p> <p>That we won't pander to the lowest common denominator over asylum and immigration. But we'll reform the systems - to make them fairer and faster.</p> <p>And that we respect people's genuine religious and cultural identities at community level. </p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On Crime - 10,000 more police on the streets and cutting the time spent on paperwork, so they can spend more time tackling drug dealers, muggers and yobs.</p> <p>Use prison as an opportunity to educate in the basics - numeracy, literacy - so that when they get out people will be far better able to find work and far less likely to reoffend.</p> <p>And for the victims of crime open up the courts so that they can confront the offenders - and speed up the system of compensation as well.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For pensioners - we will continue - to make and win the case for axing the unjust, unfair, increasingly unworkable council tax.</p> <p>And its replacement by a fair, local income tax - based on people's ability to pay.</p> <p>We'll stop the scandal of elderly people having to pay for their personal care - and probably losing the family home in the process. We would deliver free long-term care for the elderly.</p> <p>And all pensioners over 75 - the war generation - should be entitled to a pension which lifts them above mean-testing - \u00a3100 extra a month. No-one should be demeaned in their old age anymore.</p> <p>And this specific pledge to women, who have long been discriminated against because of the way the pension system works. </p> <p>For the first time you will be treated equally.</p> <p>For the first time you will have a pension in your own right.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On health - We would put patients first and free doctors and nurses from Whitehall meddling. Liberal Democrats would hack away the red tape, abolish the absurd targets and free our frustrated doctors and nurses. </p> <p>Let the local community and the local doctors and local nurses make the decisions. They are far better placed to get them right. </p> <p>And more emphasis than ever before should be placed on prevention of ill health and promotion of healthy lifestyles. We truly need a health and not just a sickness service.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On the environment - our determination to make the environment count at every level of Government means thinking green in every area.</p> <p>Yes, it's big picture stuff - from the food chain to climate change, energy to trade, aviation to sustainable international development.</p> <p>Britain can't do this alone. The Prime Minister is right to use our presidency of the EU and the G8 next year to press for consensus.</p> <p>But if we can lead by example, if we can achieve our Kyoto targets ahead of time, we can encourage other countries to sign up.</p> <p>If we can deliver 20% of our electricity needs through renewable energy by 2020, that would be leading by example.</p> <p>Take air travel - which is fast become the world's biggest polluter.</p> <p>We should be shifting taxes on aviation away from the passenger and onto the plane itself which does the polluting.</p> <p>Now that would be leading by example too, encouraging better fuel efficiency and therefore less pollution.</p> <p>But quality of life actually begins at home - it's in your street, around your community.</p> <p>And our approach to the environment must begin there too.</p> <p>The green thread that should run through all aspects of government, should run through all aspects of our lives also.</p> <p>So more park and ride schemes for our towns and cities - cutting pollution in our streets.</p> <p>More local recycling initiatives - showing how all of us can make that difference within our own homes.</p> <p>Cutting waste - reusing - improving.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>Because that's what these - and many more - policies are rooted in.</p> <p>Policies designed to create more freedom.</p> <p>Based on social fairness.</p> <p>Not bogus, false choices - designed to distract.</p> <p>But real, quality local choice - designed to deliver.</p> <p>And it's all underpinned by economic fairness as well.</p> <p>This is crucial to our credibility and critical to our success.</p> <p>From the outset, I have insisted that we have the most watertight set of tax and expenditure proposals possible. </p> <p>We want to tax more fairly and spend more wisely.</p> <p>Isn't it a disgrace that after 7 years of a supposedly Labour government the poorest 20% contribute more of their income in tax than do the richest 20%?</p> <p>We don't want the politics of economic envy. But we do want the politics of social equity.</p> <p>What does that mean?</p> <p>It means asking the top 1% of income earners to pay a top marginal rate of tax of 50p for every pound earned above \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>That pays for our immediate commitments to: </p> <p>* Scrap tuition and top-up fees for students;</p> <p>* Introduce free personal care for elderly and disabled people;</p> <p>* And keep down the level of local taxes.</p> <p>But spending on our priorities does not mean higher taxes across the board. It means looking hard as well at how much Government spends and getting value for money for taxpayers.</p> <p>And we've already found further large savings - at least \u00a35bn a year - by cutting back on big, centralised government and redirecting money to priority spending:</p> <p>\u00b7 Dropping plans for identity cards;</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrapping some government departments and relocating others away from high-cost central London;</p> <p>\u00b7 Doing less, better and more efficiently - and concentrating more on what really matters.</p> <p>It is this approach which gives us the credibility to pledge.</p> <p>\u00b7 Axing the \u00a31bn Child Trust Fund, the so called baby bonds scheme, and spending the money now when children need it most, not the state stashing it away until 2022;</p> <p>\u00b7 10,000 more police on the streets - cutting crime and the fear of crime;</p> <p>\u00b7 Making sure that by 2011 Britain finally fulfils its UN obligations by boosting the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of GNP;</p> <p>\u00b7 \u00a325 more on pensions every week for those aged 75 and over with a million pensioners taken off means testing.</p> <p>The figures add up; the balance sheet is balanced. </p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>It is trust that has to underpin everything else.</p> <p>And it's winning public trust that is going to be the biggest challenge of all.</p> <p>Over the course of this parliament one issue more than any other has helped define just what the Liberal Democrats stand for in the minds of millions of our fellow citizens.</p> <p>You know what I'm talking about.</p> <p>And the people know exactly what we've been talking about.</p> <p>From the outset we have provided rational, principled and consistent opposition to the war in Iraq.</p> <p>We've done it without exaggeration. We've done it without name-calling. We've done it - quite simply - because we believed it was the right thing to do.</p> <p>Now I believe the vast majority of people have made their minds up - one way or the other.</p> <p>Donald Rumsfeld promised shock and awe.</p> <p>What we got was shock and then steadily increasing horror. </p> <p>The Prime Minister promised action on the Middle East Road Map.</p> <p>What we got was little progress and more violence.</p> <p>There's a sullen, and increasingly angry mood on the issue. And understandably so.</p> <p>Not least when Kofi Annan declares the war illegal.</p> <p>When the Iraq Survey Group is expected to conclude that the WMD were not there.</p> <p>When the Foreign Office warned of the likely disastrous consequences.</p> <p>And when it appears the Government told the Bush administration, a full year before the war started, that it would not budge in its support for their policy of regime change - and yet the Prime Minister told our Parliament and our people that it was all about weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>There is a fundamental question that the Prime Minister has consistently failed to answer.</p> <p>I asked him this in the House of Commons in the run up to war, and again as recently as the 20th of July this year during the debate on the Butler Report.</p> <p>\"Did he advise President Bush privately - long before the United Nations route was formally abandoned - that if the President decided to prosecute an invasion of Iraq, the British would be in active military support, come what may?</p> <p>\"If he did advise the President to that effect, when did such an exchange take place?\"</p> <p>When Parliament next convenes, the Prime Minister must take the first opportunity to come to the Despatch Box and make a full statement. </p> <p>It's time we got an answer. </p> <p>And if the Prime Minister still refuses, the people can make a judgement.</p> <p>There is the ultimate verdict of the general election itself.</p> <p>Lord Hutton did not provide the answer.</p> <p>Nor did Lord Butler.</p> <p>The decision to decline to participate in Lord Butler's enquiry was a tough one at the time.</p> <p>But it was the correct decision as events have proved.</p> <p>And at the end of the day that is what trust in political leadership has to be all about.</p> <p>What trust today in what our leaders told us at the time about Iraq?</p> <p>And what kind of corrosive effect does that have on politics generally?</p> <p>Yet the tragic experience of Iraq should have the opposite effect.</p> <p>And I believe it can.</p> <p>It should galvanise people to participate, to make their views known through the ballot box.</p> <p>It should strengthen all of our resolves to rededicate ourselves to the rebuilding of effective international institutions, to the repairing of shattered alliances among long-standing friends.</p> <p>But within our own country - one lesson must be learned.</p> <p>This country is still crying out for an effective political system that responds to them and listens to the people.</p> <p>More openness. More accountability. Politicians taking responsibility for their decisions.</p> <p>Never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence.</p> <p>Never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the United Nations.</p> <p>Never again must Britain find itself on such a basis so distanced from principal partners within Europe.</p> <p>Never again should our troops find themselves without proper and adequate equipment in a war zone.</p> <p>Never again should such supreme Prime Ministerial power be allowed to progress without sufficient checks and balances.</p> <p>And without the proper operation of collective Cabinet government itself.</p> <p>And never again should a so-called \"official opposition\" be entitled to that name when it so pathetically fails to fulfil its most basic parliamentary function and duty - the provision of constructive and effective questioning of the executive of the day.</p> <p>Never again.</p> <p>But we should not just look back in anger.</p> <p>There is every sign that we need to look forward with increasing anxiety.</p> <p>And that is why the Prime Minister should also take that opportunity to give a cast iron guarantee that the United Kingdom will not support unilateral military action against Iran.</p> <p>You know some commentators will tell you that our recent victories are just the fall out from Iraq.</p> <p>That the Lib Dems are just the protest vote.</p> <p>Well, let's face it. There has been a lot for people to protest about.</p> <p>But we are being seen more and more as a party which does win elections, which does exercise responsible representation, which has become increasingly comfortable with the duties and the disciplines of power.</p> <p>Some also say that you can't go chasing left-wing voters and right-wing voters at one and the same time - while remaining consistent and true to your principles.</p> <p>It is a deeply flawed analysis - based on a fundamental misreading of today's Britain.</p> <p>Why? Because for the vast majority of people who live their lives in an increasingly inter-dependent world, facing increasingly complex issues, for them the old-fashioned nostrums of right and left no longer apply.</p> <p>They're looking for solution-based politics. Politics which address their everyday needs.</p> <p>There is a shift in the way people view politics, one that transcends any single issue.</p> <p>Iraq has been part of this, but by no means is it the whole story.</p> <p>I come across it, day in and day out.</p> <p>People see that the Labour and Conservative agendas are converging.</p> <p>Where as ours is about having the freedom to make the most of our lives.</p> <p>It's about what is fair - taxation based on ability to pay and delivery for all not the few.</p> <p>And that you have to be able to trust your political leaders and your political parties to deliver.</p> <p>There's a deep-rooted sense in our country that somehow all is not quite right.</p> <p>That somehow all is not as we're being told it is. An underlying sense of doubt.</p> <p>Made worse by the fact that people just don't trust this Government.</p> <p>This Government flags up the big, long-term difficult issues - pension provision, funding local services, global warming - but then puts off serious discussion and decisions until safely beyond another general election.</p> <p>But people don't identify with the Conservatives - because that party just doesn't connect with them.</p> <p>They hark back to a Britain that is no more. They're out of touch with the Britain of today.</p> <p>No wonder they fall back on hard-core instincts - and increasingly belongs to all our yesterdays. </p> <p>In huge swathes of the country it's the Conservatives who are now firmly established - as the third party.</p> <p>In so much of the country a vote for the Conservatives is now a wasted vote.</p> <p>The third party - on their third leader in as many years - and a third leader who's just had his third reshuffle in less than a year.</p> <p>Well, they say variety is the spice of life.</p> <p>For the Conservatives it looks to me much more like the kiss of death.</p> <p>They belong to the past. </p> <p>We're working for the future.</p> <p>We are moving from a party of protest to a party of power.</p> <p>3 party politics is here - and here to stay.</p> <p>You know, at times this past year I've felt rather nostalgic.</p> <p>21 years as a Member of Parliament.</p> <p>You learn quite a lot after more than two decades doing any job.</p> <p>Direct personal experience does teach along the way.</p> <p>That's why, whenever I'm asked to speculate - an occupational hazard - I always suggest to people not to waste time on the crystal ball, but instead learn from the history book. </p> <p>It's really quite simple.</p> <p>For the country to believe in a political party - first that party has to believe in itself. </p> <p>We're at our best, we perform best, we persuade best - when we spend our time talking positively about what it is that we have to offer.</p> <p>And we're far more likely to achieve that from a position of principled party independence - not one distracted by noises off.</p> <p>So when people ask me \"Where does your party stand?\" my starting point is not the crystal ball.</p> <p>Instead, it's crystal clear.</p> <p>No nods, no winks, no deals, no stitch ups.</p> <p>If, on polling day at next general election, more people vote Liberal Democrat - then the next day and in the next parliament what you will get are more Liberal Democrats working for more liberal democracy.</p> <p>Not something else.</p> <p>But working all out for better public policies from parliament.</p> <p>Prepared to work with others on issues of principle - like Europe.</p> <p>But not prepared to surrender our essential political independence along the way.</p> <p>That's our Liberal Democrat pledge to the people. </p> <p> So there is a fundamental choice before us all at the next General Election.</p> <p>The British people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>225 days.</p> <p>Then a stark choice. A serious choice.</p> <p>And we, increasingly, are the winning choice.</p> <p>Because all that we say and all that we do is based on those fundamentals.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust</p> <p>That's us.</p> <p>That's what we want from our politics.</p> <p>That's what we stand for.</p> <p>That's what we want our country to stand for.</p> <p>At home - and abroad.</p> <p>That's Liberal Democracy.</p>",

  "Two Israeli policemen died preventing a female suicide bomber from entering a packed Jerusalem bus shelter yesterday, probably saving many other lives. <p>The 19-year-old Palestinian woman detonated the bomb when the policeman demanded to search a bag the authorities say contained about 5kg of explosive. </p> <p>\"She threw her head back and then there was an explosion,\" a witness, Debbie Segal, told Army radio. \"A few seconds later, her body burst into flames.\" </p> <p>Another witness, Binyamin Miller, said: \"I thought there must be many people dead because the explosion seemed so loud _ A lot of people were very, very lucky today.\" </p> <p>About 20 people were wounded, including a nine year-old boy. </p> <p>The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades named the bomber as Zainab Abu Salem from a Nablus refugee camp. </p> <p>Jerusalem's police chief, Ilan Franco, said that the policemen had prevented many more deaths inside the bus shelter, where more than 20 people were waiting, or would have occurred had she boarded a rush-hour bus. </p> <p>\"The operation of border police officers today in Jerusalem ... prevented a very big attack,\" he said. </p> <p>Israel was braced for an attack to coincide with last week's Jewish new year and Yom Kippur on Saturday. </p> <p>The bombing took place in French Hill, a mostly Jewish suburb of occupied east Jerusalem, which has been a favoured target for suicide bombings over the past four years of intifada. </p> <p>The prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said Israel would hit back at the Palestinians with \"all force\" </p> <p>Jerusalem's mayor, Uri Lupolianski, led calls for the speeding up of the construction of Israel's barrier through the West Bank and east Jerusalem. </p> <p>\"This tragic attack should remind us that the government needs to hurry up and finish construction of the security fence\", Mr Lupolianski said. </p> <p>Last night, Israeli troops entered the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis to root out militants, around 20 tanks lining up on the outskirts as back-up. An Israeli helicopter fired a missile at two gunmen, but they escaped unharmed. Chris McGreal, Jerusalem</p>",
  "Former Mexican pop phenomenon Gloria Trevi has been released from prison after nearly five years, cleared of kidnapping, corruption of minors, and complicity to rape charges. <p>The case has absorbed Mexico since it broke in 1998. The verdict, read out in a jail courthouse with Trevi listening behind a white wire mesh cage fondling a rosary, was broadcast live on national television.</p> <p>Trevi, now 36, who earned the moniker \"Mexico's Madonna\" - left the jail in the northern Mexican city of Chihuahua on Tuesday night to the cheers of a small group of fans gathered outside.</p> <p>She promised a new album soon of songs composed in jail.</p> <p>\"After four years, eight months and eight days in prison, justice has been done,\" Trevi told Mexican news anchorman Joaqu\u00edn Lopez Doriga just before leaving jail.</p> <p>Impeccably groomed and clearly delighted, the one-time symbol of irreverence mentioned God in almost every utterence.</p> <p>Trevi said she had \"no time or space in my heart,\" for bitterness.</p> <p>\"I can't believe it. In the morning and throughout the day, I felt like I was in an old western movie, like my head was in the noose and I was waiting for a cowboy to arrive to save me,\" she told reporters.</p> <p>Fans who greeted her also hurled insults at their idol's main accuser, the 21-year-old former backing singer Karina Yapor, who joined Trevi's roving musical troupe as a star-struck 12-year-old.</p> <p>\"This is an international embarrassment,\" she said as she left the court. \"A failure of justice.\"</p> <p>Ms Yapor claims the then pop diva lured her and other young girls into the group promising musical training. She says Trevi actually turned them into sexual slaves of her manager and former lover, Sergio Andrade.</p> <p>Judge Javier Pineda ruled that there was not enough evidence to support the charges against Trevi and two other backing singers also accused of complicity. The case against Mr Andrade continues.</p> <p>Mr Andrade discovered the 16-year-old Gloria de los Angeles Trevino Ruiz in 1985 and put her in a girl band he managed called Boquitas Pintadas.</p> <p>The renamed Gloria Trevi went solo in 1989. Her raspy-voiced teen anthems caught on and the Trevi phenomenon was launched. The singer's first three records sold over five million copies and prompted armies of wannabee teenage girls to imitate her rebellious style.</p> <p>Then in 1998 a former backing singer and ex wife of Mr Andrade, Aline Hernandez, published a book detailing abuses and humiliation she claimed characterized the cult-like troupe.</p> <p>Her lengthy brush with the law began later that year after a baby abandoned in a convent in Spain turned out to be the child of her backing singer, Karina Yapor. At the time, the teenage Ms Yapor was thought to be under the charge of Trevi and Mr Andrade whose whereabouts were unknown.</p> <p>Ms Yapor's mother filed the first legal suit in her home city of Chihuahua, which began after her daughter's reappearance a few months later, and eventually turned into the current case.</p> <p>In the meantime, the scandal was further fuelled by other members of the group and former proteges of Mr Andrade, who told similar stories of abuse. Several have young children they say were fathered by him.</p> <p>An international manhunt finally located the singer and her manager in Rio de Janiero. They were arrested in January 2000, along with yet another backing singer, Mar\u00eda Raquenel Portillo.</p> <p>Even with the accused behind bars, the plot twists continued. In mid-2001, Trevi announced she was pregnant despite being in an all-female wing of a jail.</p> <p>After first refusing to name the father, the singer said she was raped by a prison guard. DNA tests produced by the Brazilian authorities indicated Mr Andrade fathered the child, although Trevi's defence claimed the results were doctored.</p> <p>Trevi's son, Angel Gabriel, was born in prison nine months before she returned voluntarily to Mexico in December 2002.</p> <p>Ms Portillo followed a few months later. Mr Andrade was extradited in November last year.</p> <p>The group has claimed the charges were fabricated by a Mexico TV network, in retaliation for Trevi's decision to sign a contract with a rival broadcaster.</p>",

This week he reconsiders domestic energy. </strong></p> <p><strong>Life before</strong></p> <p> Jane and I have two very different responses to the merest hint of a chill in the air: Jane will turn to me and say, \"Stick the heating on, will you?\" and I'll sniffily retort, \"Can't you just put another layer on?\" Probably a bit mean, admittedly, given that she suffers from Raynaud's disease (a painful lack of blood supply to the hands and feet) but I do hate to see money going up in flames. </p> <p> Together, though, our responses sum up our heating strategy for the home - namely, that we don't really have one. The best I can offer is that we use a timer on our \"combi\" boiler during the winter. For example, on weekdays during cold spells, the central heating is timed to come on at 6.30am and go off at 9am once we've left for work. It then comes on again at about 5pm and shuts down for the night at 10.30pm. </p> <p>At weekends, depending on how cold it is, we override the timed setting and have it running on \"constant\". With a baby in the house we now tend to have the heating set slightly higher than normal, at about 23C. We're quite lazy, too, about monitoring which radiators are turned on, so we are invariably heating rooms that we're not using. </p> <p> But it's not all about the wanton waste of energy in our home.

  "<p><strong> Airline wrong about visa - but won't pay up</strong><br> Airline security is a curious business. In the same week that a reader tells me how his wife was waved on to a flight despite (inadvertently) bearing a cancelled passport, I hear of New Zealander Garth Cartwright, who was barred from boarding a plane from Heathrow to Macedonia because he did not have a visa. </p> <p>In vain he pointed out that he did not need one. He exhibited his Lonely Planet guide confirming this and showed numerous previous entry and exit stamps to Macedonia in his passport, but the officious Austrian Airlines representative was unimpressed. \"With considerable rudeness she called me a liar and suggested I had entered Macedonia illegally before,\" says Cartwright, who had to miss his flight, for which he had paid \u00a3291. </p> <p>He called the Austrian Airlines headquarters in Vienna and was reassured that New Zealand passport holders did not need a visa to enter Macedonia. He was advised to get a letter from the Macedonian embassy confirming this in case ground staff decided to bar him again. </p> <p>Cold comfort indeed, for his first flight was non-refundable and his only option was to book and pay for another. Plus he had to spend half a day at the embassy while a letter was drafted for him to wave at check-in staff. He eventually reached his destination three days later than planned, having run up alarming phone bills cancelling hotel bookings and rescheduling meetings. </p> <p> <strong> A call to the Macedonian embassy confirms that New Zealand passport holders have not needed a visa to enter the country for the past couple of years, but Austrian Airlines still insists that it acted correctly. Its ground staff glean the latest travel requirements from a travel information manual issued by the international airlines regulator Iata, and the edition for last October apparently stated that a visa was necessary. The following month's issue requires no such document, however, so, according to the airline, \"We have to assume that the Macedonian authorities have since amended their requirements\". </strong> </p> <p><strong>All very odd and I'm still waiting to hear from Iata as to where it got its erroneous information from. In the meantime, Austrian Airlines has decided that the alleged rudeness of its ground staff is a much more serious business and has offered Cartwright a free business-class trip to eastern Europe. A beautiful gesture, except that he no longer travels to the region. He would prefer a cheque to cover the expenses involved in rescheduling his flight but sadly Austrian Airlines is immovable on that one.</strong> </p> <p> <strong> They took the money - but where's the window?</strong><br> Anyone who has glanced at this column over the summer will know that when it comes to replacing doors and windows, the double-glazing firm Coldseal should be bottom of the list. First, there was the case of the reader who mistakenly sent payment for works directly to Coldseal instead of to the bank which had financed his credit agreement. Instead of passing the cheque on, Coldseal cashed it and hung on to the money for a year while the customer was harried for interest payments. Then we heard from a man who had signed up for remedial works by Coldseal, only to be told, six months later, that the company couldn't fulfil the contract after all. Not that it saw that as a reason to return his hefty deposit and it took the fearsome might of Consumer to wrest the money back again. </p> <p>Now there's an SOS from Yorkshire, where Beth Lindemann has been living for the past nine months behind a plank of wood instead of a window. Coldseal were booked to replace her windows back in January, but the fitters discovered that they didn't have a glass pane for a new door they had provided so they boarded it up and departed. After two months the fitters turned up on the wrong day and found nobody at home. By the time Lindemann had tracked them down the glass panel had gone missing and had to be reordered. There followed another two-month delay, after which the fitters arrived, but not the glass, which had once again mysteriously vanished from the Coldseal warehouse. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Lindemann has already paid for the job and her local Trading Standards advises that legal action is her only route. </p> <p> <strong> There's a chance that it may not come to that thanks to our energetic friend at Coldseal's PR company. An official has been round to inspect the door and an installation date has been organised for tomorrow. Whether the glass will turn up along with the workmen is another matter. </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Life savings entrusted to the postal system</strong> <br> For a daily dose of suspense, thrills and horror, where else do you turn but the Post Office? There's the suspense of wondering whether your mail will actually turn up, the thrill if it does and, more likely, the horror when yet another morning passes without the rattle of the letterbox. </p> <p>Given the number of items that are delayed, lost and, occasionally, plundered each year, it seems extraordinary that banks should be encouraging us to entrust our life savings to the postal system. John Welch has learned that Alliance &amp; Leicester is to close his local branch in Islington and that it advises customers to conduct future transactions by post. They are even expected to mail off their pass books if they need updating. Welch is dismayed and has written twice to the bank asking what responsibility it would take if payments are lost or misappropriated. So far he has not received a sensible reply. </p> <p> <strong> As more and more bank branches withdraw from the high street, the reliability of postal banking is likely to become a big issue. Alliance &amp; Leicester's response is not reassuring, although it insists that lost items are rare and carefully investigated. If a cheque sent by one of its surviving branches to a customer were to be intercepted and cashed, the matter would have to be reported to the police and a crime number obtained before the bank would investigate. Then, if fraud could be proved, the account holder would be reimbursed. If a cheque sent by a customer met a similar fate, he or she would have to trust that the company who had issued it had similar procedures in place and would raise a replacement if theft was proven. </strong> </p> <p><strong>It's a good idea to ring the company and check its procedures in case of fraud before entrusting the cheque to the post, Alliance &amp; Leicester advises blithely. There's just as much hassle involved if a cheque simply vanishes in the post since the account holder would have to get it stopped and a new one issued. It is possible to pay a cheque in at the Post Office, but you only get a receipt for the envelope, not for the amount.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Write to us at 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Standing in the physics laboratory of Baghdad University, Professor Raad Radhi points to the machine for measuring liquid helium. \"It hasn't worked for two or three years,\" he says, in front of a twisting assembly of pipes. Colleagues nod vigorously. \"In fact we haven't got anything,\" he adds. \"We don't even have chairs for our students to sit on. </p> <p>\"I got my PhD from the University of Michigan. Imagine the difference between the facilities here and there. How are we expected to work?\" </p> <p>It is a good question. Some 17 months after the fall of Baghdad, Iraqi science is in parlous state. Most of the equipment used by Radhi and his department, much of it British, is 20 or 30 years old. \"Look at this,\" the professor says, as he shows off the university's crumbling electronics lab. \"Most of this stuff doesn't work. The few things that do work should be in a museum.\" </p> <p>\"We might be able to make coffee on this,\" he adds sarcastically, gesturing at a plate for soldering metal. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising the professor and other scientists at Iraq's premier academic institution are demoralised. Over the past 20 years the country's scientific community has, as the science dean, Abdul Mehdi Talib, explains, been much reduced. During last year's invasion of Iraq, looters descended on the leafy campus, an enclave of date palms and saysaban trees in central Baghdad. They carried off everything they could - microscopes, oscilloscopes, air-conditioning units - stripping many of the university's five science colleges. \"They took the lot. When I came back to my office I found only the walls,\" Dr Talib recalls. \"We managed to buy some of our equipment back from people selling it on the street. But a lot of it was smuggled up to the north and disappeared.\" </p> <p>Even before last year's war, Iraq's once vibrant scientific community had fallen on hard times. It had, for more than a decade, been cut off from the rest of the world. After Saddam appointed himself president in 1979, Iraqi scientists - many of whom had studied in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s - found it hard to travel abroad. Then in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait. </p> <p>After the first Gulf war, the UN imposed sanctions, cutting off Iraqi scientists' few remaining contacts with the west. They were no longer able to travel to international conferences or collaborate with colleagues abroad; foreign governments rejected their visa applications. Publication in foreign journals ceased. They were forbidden from buying scientific literature and new equipment. </p> <p>The priority now, Talib says, is for Iraqi scientists to re-establish a diverse range of contacts with the international scientific community. \"We are poor experimentally. Most of our research relies on simulation. And we need a lot of things.\" </p> <p>In some respects, Baghdad University is like any other academic community - male and female students sit together in the sunny garden cafe, drinking tea under white umbrellas. In other ways, it is different: guards with Kalashnikovs are posted at all the entrances; every car that enters is searched for bombs. A radical Islamist group recently demanded that men and women in Iraqi higher education should be taught separately. So far, though, the ubiquitous suicide bombers have not tried to blow up the campus. </p> <p>Since last year's invasion, the university has published several research projects, including studies on the etching of polymer-metal composites by laser ablation; on generation and decay of laser driven shock waves; and a spectroscopic study of the dye DCM as an active medium for luminescent solar concentrators, that focus sunlight. </p> <p>\"We hope that we can bring our PhD students to the same standard as the US or Britain,\" the professor says. \"They are the future of this country.\" What, then, was his message to the wider scientific world? \"We are your brothers. We graduated from your universities. Now we need your help.\" </p> <p>So far, though, he and his colleagues have been disappointed by the response from the British government; there has scarcely been one. The dean is keen to send his best PhD students and faculty staff abroad; so far, Britain has offered just 50 scholarships for the whole of Iraq. </p> <p>Hatim Attiya, the university's scien tific affairs president, visited Birmingham University earlier this year, but laments that such opportunities for training are few. With Iraq under American and British occupation, the university hoped that its facilities, many of them damaged or destroyed, might be rebuilt. \"They promised to rebuild Iraq. But it hasn't happened here,\" Radhi says, as his colleagues frantically scribble lists of urgently needed equipment and hand them to the Guardian: lasers, wavelength division multiplexes, vacuum ovens. \"I can only conclude that they lied,\" he says. \"We are the best university in Iraq. Imagine what the others are like,\" he adds. </p> <p>The university is on the brink of signing a memorandum of understanding with Sussex University, which has offered to donate instruments, including a second-hand spectrophotometer, and a stock of chemi cals. So far, though, nobody has figured out a way of shipping them to Iraq. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems that Iraqi scientists face is that they have become famous internationally for the wrong reasons. Talib, who completed his physics PhD at Manchester University in the early 1970s, says it is important to distinguish between scientists who had worked in academic institutions under the old regime and those who worked for Saddam's government. \"We want to rejoin the world community,\" he said. \"They shouldn't consider us as devils. We are academics. We don't like politics.\" Immediately after the fall of Baghdad, elections were held at the university for a new president, vice-presidents and deans. The old tier of the administration that had been appointed by Saddam was removed; everybody else went back to work. </p> <p>At the same time, the US military ar rested dozens of Iraqi scientists who had been part of Saddam's vast military-industrial complex. The US's aim was to discover Saddam's weapons of mass destruction; some 17 months later it has now become embarrassingly clear, even to Tony Blair, that these weapons don't exist. Despite this, the Bush administration continues to hold a small number of Iraqi scientists - including two women, Rihab Taha, nicknamed Dr Germ, said to have been in charge of Iraq's biological weapons programme in the 1980s, and Huda Ammash, dubbed Mrs Anthrax by US intelligence - at a high-security camp at Baghdad's international airport. None of the scientists has been charged with any crime; the US authorities have refused them legal access. </p> <p>In January this year, Mohammed Munim Al-Izmerly, a distinguished chemistry professor, mysteriously died while in American custody. An Iraqi autopsy found he had been hit over the head with a blunt instrument. </p> <p>Eight months on, the White House has still not offered an explanation. Other scientists still being held without charge include Amer Al Saadi, Saddam's chief scientific adviser who studied at Battersea College of Technology- now part of Surrey University- in the 1960s. In February 2003, Dr Saadi appeared on TV to rubbish the US Secretary of State Colin Powell's claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. In April 2003, three days after Baghdad fell, Saadi gave himself up to the Americans; they have kept him in jail ever since. Saadi's German wife, Helma, says her husband's only crime was to have mocked Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, in a press conference before the invasion. \"Under the Geneva convention, prisoners of war should be either charged or released once a conflict is over,\" she says at her home in Baghdad. \"My husband is in a black hole of illegality. He was the only one who told the truth. Because of this the Americans have kept him in prison for one and a half years.\" </p> <p>But it would be wrong to suggest that, despite the overwhelming obstacles, Iraqi scientists have given up. Some 71,000 students currently attend Baghdad University - half of them in science departments - together with 6,000 postgraduates; the university's teaching staff includes 4,000 lecturers and about 1,000 professors. Facilities are sufficient for undergraduate work; the problem, Talib admits, is that at postgraduate level they are woefully inadequate. There are also no jobs for bright PhD students who want to remain in academia. The university doesn't have any money: 90% of its meagre budget goes on staff salaries, which now average $450 a month. </p> <p>\"Even if we had the cash, we can't buy anything because Iraq doesn't have an international banking system,\" Talib says. \"We urgently need a laser lab for our medical students who are investigating cancer problems. But we are not allowed to import lasers.\" It would, one would have thought, be a good investment: spend half a million pounds on bringing young Iraqi scientists to Britain for doctoral and postdoctoral courses; and revive Britain's once-fruitful scientific relationship with Iraq. </p> <p>Under the old regime, much of Iraq's intelligentsia fled, to neighbouring countries in the Middle East, and to Europe and America. Unless western governments move swiftly, a new exodus will begin. And Professor Radhi's conked-out liquid helium machine will never get repaired. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> How can you help?

  "<p>Police are still trying to trace a high-flying American schoolgirl today after she ran away to Britain when her parents threatened not to pay for her to go to university.</p> <p>Jing Wen Chen left her home in Rolla, Missouri, following an argument with her parents on Sunday, and caught a plane from Philadelphia to Gatwick. The 15-year-old straight-A student told immigration officials at the Sussex airport that she planned to spend a few days looking around colleges.</p> <p>Jing used her mother's credit card to rent a mobile phone from Victoria station in London on Monday, and made a number of calls to the US before returning the handset yesterday lunchtime. Sussex police said she had not been seen or used the credit card since then. She was carrying just a small rucksack, and had around 500 dollars in cash.</p> <p>Det Insp Bill Warner, the officer leading the hunt, said that Jing had run away of her own accord, but was considered an \"extremely vulnerable person\". She had always planned to study medicine at Harvard or Yale, but decided to flee to the UK following a row with her university-professor father Genda Chen and mother Sharon over using the internet, according to Mr Warner. </p> <p>Jing, an American citizen who was born in China, had often mentioned a desire to study at Oxford University and police were investigating whether she may have travelled there. Jing's father said he and his wife were \"very worried\" about their only child. </p> <p>Prof Chen said: \"This is totally out of character for her. She was such an enthusiastic and motivated student and suddenly she has dropped everything.\" </p> <p>Jing is described as of Asian appearance, and about 5ft 8in with shoulder-length black hair. She speaks with an American accent and was last seen wearing a black jogging suit, black short coat and flip-flops.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: The Lib Dems' party conference, John Kerry in fighting mood and Cat Stevens as terror threat</p> <p><b>'MR BLAIR, I DON'T WANT TO DIE'</b></p> <p>For once, all the main morning newspapers lead with the same story and, in many cases, the same headline. A video appeal from British hostage Kenneth Bigley to Tony Blair was last night posted on an Islamist website. \"I need you to help me now, Mr Blair, because you are the only person on God's earth who can,\" reads the Times headline, quoting Mr Bigley verbatim.</p> <p>The Guardian places Mr Bigley's words against a fuzzy image of him from the video in which he is wearing an orange jumpsuit. The paper said he \"appeared composed, but there was desperation in his voice\".</p> <p>An announcement from the Iraqi government yesterday that at least one prominent female prisoner, Rihab Taha, a biological weapons scientist, would be released was countermanded by the US, which is holding her, and appears to have shut off Mr Bigley's one glimmer of hope.</p> <p>The Telegraph's report suggests the video was an attempt to drive a wedge between Britain and the US, and between the coalition and the Iraqi interim government. Its leader column argues there should be no surrender to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the group holding Mr Bigley and, it is believed, the man who personally beheaded his two fellow US captives.</p> <p>\"It is not easy for the prime minister to tell the country that he is powerless to save the life of a British hostage,\" the paper says. \"That, alas, is the case [...] it would be cruel as well as false for him to imply that anything he might do or say could have the least influence on the closed minds of the terrorists.\"</p> <p>The Financial Times says that the \"grim horror\" of the daily news from Iraq will frustrate Mr Blair's attempts to focus on a domestic agenda at next week's Labour party conference, and the Independent adds that Labour's private polling suggests Mr Blair's Iraq policy could cost it 3m votes at the next general election. Seamus Milne, writing in the Guardian's comment pages, suggests that Labour should use its conference to vote for a troop withdrawal \"to begin to undo the damage to itself and lay the ground for change in Iraq [...] It is now clear that there will be no security in Iraq while US and British forces remain.\"</p> <p>The Times adds that another Islamist group last night claimed the murder of two Italian aid workers, Simona Toretta and Simona Pari. If the statement is correct they are the first foreign female hostages to be killed in Iraq.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1310807,00.html\">'Mr Blair, I don't want to die\"</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1310804,00.html\">Labour must dare to speak for Britain - and Iraq</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/23/dl2301.xml\">Telegraph: No surrender to al-Zarqawi</a><br>* <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/f007164a-0cfc-11d9-b543-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Kidnapping ensures Blair focuses on Iraq</a><br>* <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=564726\">Independent: Blair's Iraq 'fixation' is costing Labour votes</a><br>* <a href=\"http://search.thetimes.co.uk/cgi-bin/ezk2srch?-aSTART#\">Times: 'Help me now, Mr Blair'</a></p> <p><b>SOMETHING OF THE RIGHT</b></p> <p>Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, today addresses his party conference with a pledge to take on the Tories, according to the preview reports of his speech. What the Tories will make of this is anyone's guess, but there are still strong indications the rivals they fear most are the UK Independence party. The Mirror finds strong similarities between Mr Howard's speech yesterday on immigration and asylum - he wants to pull out of the UN convention on human rights, and set an upper limit on immigration - to one made a few weeks ago by the UKIP MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. The permatanned eurosceptic champion was reportedly furious: \"He is saying virtually the same thing as us.

  "Sweeping counter-terrorism laws were debated in the Russian parliament yesterday, including proposals that would allow the country to declare itself at war and impose tight restrictions on travel and the media. <p>Under the plans, Russian television and radio journalists would not be allowed to report on a siege until the situation had been resolved. </p> <p>The measures are part of a package debated by the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, which has been tasked with drawing up a new anti-terror bill in the wake of the Beslan massacre. </p> <p>Two-thirds of the Duma's MPs are members of the United Russia party, which supports the president, Vladimir Putin. This has led some analysts to worry that many of the proposed changes are not related to terrorism, but are part of a Kremlin effort to exert more central control. </p> <p>It will take months for parliament to receive Kremlin approval for and finalise some of the many and far-reaching laws proposed yesterday. </p> <p>According to MPs familiar with the drafts and Russian media reports, the planned laws could give the Kremlin the right to declare a \"state of war\" in the event of \"a terrorist action representing a threat to national security\". </p> <p>At present, a state of war, which rescinds many basic civil rights, can be declared only in response to an armed invasion by another country. </p> <p>Another proposed law, suggested by the pro-Putin nationalist Rodina party, would ban broadcast coverage of a hostage crisis until after the captives had been freed. </p> <p>A Rodina MP, Alexander Krutov, said: \"This is to avoid the severe psychological impact that terrorist acts have on the population - one of their main aims.\" </p> <p>He said terrorists gained valuable information from the media during sieges, even helping them to escape. </p> <p>The media have also been the target of comments by the FSB security chief, Nikolai Patrushev, a key confidant of Mr Putin. </p> <p>\"To fight terrorism, the state needs a comprehensive system of measures covering all branches of power: legislative, executive and judicial, and, of course, the mass media,\" he told reporters this week. </p> <p>He has also said that the image of police informers and agents needs to be revamped. </p> <p>New laws are also being drafted on \"free movement ... and registration rules\". </p> <p>At present, Russians and foreigners have to be registered at a particular address, and re-registered if they move. Some MPs want to tighten the restrictions, limiting internal migration, and allowing police to search someone's home during a routine document check. </p> <p>Greater restrictions are also being considered on the purchase of travel tickets. The suicide bombers who brought down two airliners last month bought tickets with minimal documents at the last minute. A vaguely worded resolution passed last night said that \"if necessary, special passport, visa and registration measures must be introduced in individual regions\". </p> <p>Stricter punishments for terrorists are also being drafted, although yesterday the parliament rejected one of the harsher proposals - to lift the moratorium on the death penalty. </p> <p>Measures being considered include the confiscation of property belonging to a terrorist's family, and the criminalisation of the failure to inform the authorities about a terrorist act. </p> <p>A source in the Duma said it was possible the legislation would include a revamp of the special military forces. </p> <p>Vladimir Pribylovsky, the head of the Panorama thinktank, said the terrorism laws were \"simply a pretext to realise the reforms that the president and his inner circle have conceived years ago\". </p> <p>Masha Lipman from the Carnegie Centre in Moscow said the Kremlim usually allowed a series of extreme measures to be floated by \"faceless MPs\" so they could \"probe and try\" them on public opinion. </p> <p>\"This is the case with the idea to lift the death penalty moratorium. They get to knock it down and look enlightened, liberal and as if they belong in Europe.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> 'Didn't millions cheer?'</strong><br> </p> <p>It was not until Tuesday that the media began to hear what Momart had been storing in the warehouse (it has not been known until now that the \"Momart warehouse\" was, in fact, a warehouse Momart rented from a household removals firm). From the first reporting of the fire, on TV and radio and in evening newspapers on Tuesday, the media focused almost exclusively on the loss of works in the collection of the former advertising mogul Charles Saatchi, and on three artists in particular: Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers, Dinos and Jake. This was partly because Saatchi released the news of the damage to his collection early - the presence of paintings by Ayres, Heron and Heath, as well as works by more obscure artists such as Redgrave, only emerged later - and partly because Emin, Hirst and the Chapmans were lead characters in Britain's great popular narrative of celebrity, money, talent and scandal. </p> <p>Over the next two days, the news spread around the globe. Big papers in the world's traditional art capitals ran lengthy stories. Le Monde devoted 500 words to the catastrophe, writing of the destruction of \" la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre tente de Tracy Amin\" (sic). The New York Times ran a thousand-word story on the blow to \"the influential and showy Young British Artist movement championed and sustained by Mr Saatchi for the last 15 or so years.\" Under the headline Flaming Tragedy, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung devoted 700 words to the conflagration, including \" das Zelt von Tracey Emin\". As the news edged away from the great conurbations it slipped down the list. The News-Tribune in Duluth, Minnesota, relegated the information to a 111-word news in brief, after short paragraphs about the death of 860 people in Caribbean floods and plans to build a new Wal-Mart store in Chicago. </p> <p>By this time, reaction to the fire in Britain had already taken a decisive shift in another direction: towards glee and schadenfreude. A virtual mob of journalists, pundits, radio phone-in callers, letter-writers and vox poppers declared in one way or another that the Momart loss was Britain's gain. Whoever set the building alight, they implied, was an artist at least on a par with any of the creators in the Saatchi collection. </p> <p>\"The large picture on this page aptly illustrates the smouldering ruins of British modern art. It is a ghastly sight,\" wrote Tom Morgan in the Daily Express. \"Indeed, it is so horrible that some experts believe the photograph could be framed and entered for the Turner prize. They would further argue that the scorched and smoking scene has more intrinsic value than the \u00a350m worth of pieces destroyed in the blaze.\" In the Daily Mirror, the columnist and novelist Tony Parsons asked: \"Can a fire ever be funny? Only if all the overpriced, over-discussed trash that we have had rammed down our throats in recent years by these ageing enfant terribles is consumed by the fire. Then the fire is not merely funny ... it is bloody hilarious.\" </p> <p>The newdesks of two of Britain's biggest newspapers both had the same idea on Wednesday, 48 hours after the fire began. Next day the Sun ran a story bylined \"Toulouse Le Plot, Sun fine art critic.\" Le Plot said he had saved a fortune by replacing one of Emin's pieces with a tent he had bought for \u00a325. \"Tracey sewed the names on her tent, but I cut the letters out from cardboard and stuck them on with a 50p second-hand Pritt stick,\" wrote Le Plot. In the Daily Mail, Paul Harris recorded: \"In the space of an afternoon, using techniques gleaned from the Blue Peter school of art, we knocked up a replica of the love tent and the names it contained. The result was a work, you may think, which is indistinguishable from the real thing.\" Elsewhere in the same edition of the paper Godfrey Barker asked: \"Didn't millions cheer as this 'rubbish' went up in flames?\" </p> <p>The hostility and scepticism went beyond the old tabloids to the new ones, always focusing on Emin, Hirst and the Chapmans and on how easy modern art was to make and thus remake. \"Why can't Brit Art's finest devote half a weekend to knocking them out all over again?\" asked Hugh Rifkind in the Times. Tom Lubbock in the Independent wrote: \"It's odd to hear talk about irreplaceable losses. Really? You'd have thought that, with the will and the funding, many of these works were perfectly replaceable. It wouldn't be very hard for Tracey Emin to re-stitch the names of Every One I Have Ever Slept With on to a little tent (it might need some updating since 1995.)\" </p> <p>On the first edition of Radio 4's Any Questions? after the fire, a questioner asked David Lammy, Theresa May, William Rees-Mogg and Don Foster: \"Does the panel mourn the loss of works of modern art, such as Tracey Emin's tent?\" </p> <p>May said: \"I'm just waiting for Tate Modern now to have a pile of ashes in the room, as one of the exhibitions.\" The audience applauded. Jonathan Dimbleby asked May if she had heard of Patrick Heron. May said she had not. Dimbleby told her that Heron's widow Katharine had described the fire as like a bereavement. May tried to backtrack. Dimbleby turned to Rees-Mogg, who had been honing his response to the original question. \"I think mourn is a bit strong,\" he said, and the audience laughed and clapped. </p> <p>One of the people listening, at his home in Barnes, was Mel Gooding, Heron's biographer. He told me recently that he didn't hold it against Dimbleby that the presenter wrongly described Katharine Heron as Patrick Heron's widow - the artist's wife, Delia, is dead, and Katharine is one of their two daughters - but had been shocked by Rees-Mogg's dismissal of the impact of the loss of artworks. </p> <p>Gooding called up an email from the Heron family he had received on the morning of May 26, telling him that a large group of Patrick's paintings would never be seen again. </p> <p>\"That idea - it makes me feel strange, even reading it now,\" he said. \"If you are concerned with art, and love art, and are very closely involved with a particular artist's work, and know you'll never see it again - that's why it's a bereavement. It's like when someone dies. You know you'll never be able to speak to them again. To hear the dreadful Rees-Mogg say 'mourn is a bit strong' struck me as appallingly insensitive.\" </p> <p>Even now, four months later, Katharine Heron said, \"I find it almost impossible to talk about it because it's so raw.\" The strained tone of her voice as she spoke expressed the truth of it. \"The insurers are dealing with everything and we're leaving it in their hands. From their point of view it couldn't be simpler: it's a material loss. From our point of view, the loss is completely different.\" </p> <p>About 50 of Heron's paintings were lost in the fire (the family is not yet releasing the exact details). The artist's reputation has risen lately, on the back of a successful retrospective at the Tate in 1998. Many of the paintings stored in the warehouse Momart rented from Goldstar Removals were from that exhibition, including his acclaimed final works. \"We hadn't decided where they would go afterwards,\" said Katharine. \"We thought we had plenty of time. </p> <p>\"Even at the worst stage of people burning books, actually, somewhere, the manuscript or the idea or the story stayed, and even if you lost the score of a piece of music, or if you lost a choreography, they can be recreated, because they exist by being reproduced. The thing about something like a painting or a sculpture or any other artefact-based art form is, once it's gone, it has gone. It's so absolutely final. </p> <p>\"The first thing is, I think: Thank God nobody died. People always come first. But the second thought is that, actually, the whole life of somebody like my father was about his art, every single thing was focused on his art, and if a substantial amount of his work is destroyed, it's like denying his existence, a denial of life.\" </p> <p>Blameless as she is, Katharine Heron is troubled by another feeling: guilt. \"I just sort of think one of my responsibilities in life is to be the curator, or the looker-after of these things, the guardian of them, so there's a very strong feeling that one's somehow failed to look after something that wasn't for oneself, but for other people. No matter what anybody says, I keep coming back to that feeling. I've had huge pleasure from these paintings but my children, my grandchildren, won't have that pleasure.\" Others may miss Vertical Light most strongly: Katharine Heron will miss her father's painting of her mother when her mother was pregnant with her. </p> <p>Katharine Heron is an artist too. She is a successful architect and heads the architecture department at Westminster University. I asked her about the reaction of the media and the public to the fire. \"Artists still have the ability to make people frightened,\" she said. \"So they make them into a joke ... I think art, altogether, has taken a beating from this fire.\" </p> <p>I interviewed Michael Craig-Martin in his beautifully austere, white, bright studio, located at ground zero of British hipness somewhere between Clerkenwell and Shoreditch. Some of his recent prints, colours as sharp as sweets, lay on view; he had two shows coming up. Craig-Martin said he had been disturbed by the vehemence towards the destroyed art from the more serious press. He had felt strongly enough about Lubbock's piece in the Independent to write to that paper in protest. </p> <p>\"I thought, in the review I wrote a letter about, that there was extraordinary personal anger, this is revenge, he's furious about something,\" Craig-Martin told me. \"Many of the people in the art world are very angry about the art world. I don't know much about the other worlds but I never get the impression that the worlds of music or the worlds of theatre or literature have so many people who are angry at the art form itself, and angry or disappointed or upset about it. There's a lot of people involved in the art world who are on the verge of hating it.\" </p> <p>Talking about Britain and its relationship to art, Craig-Martin recalled the treatment of Jacob Epstein's Ages of Man sculptures for the British Medical Association building - now Zimbabwe House - on the Strand, in 1907. Edwardian London proved unprepared for 18 monumental, anatomically correct, naked males in a public place, and the Evening Standard launched a campaign to have them removed. In the 1930s, on the pretext that a fractured stone penis had fallen and nearly killed a pedestrian, the sculptures were castrated and mutilated; thus they remain today, neither fully destroyed nor fully preserved. It was as if the icon-smashing years of the Reformation had never been forgotten. </p> <p>\"In most other countries the average person is not interested,\" he said. \"Here there's a history of vehement attacks on, particularly, the visual arts, and I always wonder whether this doesn't have some puritan base, some base in iconoclasm, the destruction of the arts in the past; if there isn't some strange folk memory of this thing. It's hard to understand the level of upset about it unless there was some deep-seated feeling that it was really very, very important.\" </p> <p>An attack on some of the artists whose work was stored in the Goldstar Removals warehouse could have been an attack on all, but it wasn't, really. Among the artists whose work was lost in the fire, there was a stark dividing line between the relatively young celebrity artists such as Emin, the Chapmans and Hirst, those who rose to prominence in the 1990s under Saatchi's patronage, and the abstract expressionist artists whose rise came in the 1960s, such as Heron, Ayres and Heath. </p> <p>In an extremely concise email, Emin told me that she was still angry at the way she had been singled out for special treatment after the fire, to the extent that she had wondered about leaving Britain. \"The papers are always going to pick on me,\" she wrote. \"It does make me think sometimes why do I still live in this country?\" Yet she at least has the consolation of notoriety, not to mention great patronage. The older generation of artists caught up in the Momart disaster did not just lose work: they were mentioned, in the coverage, as an afterthought, lacking the popular infamy of the once-Young British Artists but not yet having acquired the popular affection once despised modern artists, like the French impressionists, have won. </p> <p>Both Emin and Dinos Chapman told me that they had not been influenced by the work or philosophy of the older British artists whose work was destroyed. Few artists in any field will admit to being heirs to the previous generation, even if they are, but I felt that Emin and Chapman meant it. Chapman went further, sounding Rees-Moggian in his brisk endorsement of the disposability of art. \"I think it's quite strange to have a sense of mourning over an object. As Tracey said, nobody died. </p> <p>\"I don't believe in the longevity of art. There's lots of stuff gone missing or past its sell-by date. This is why we're not so cut up about Hell. In a funny way it's quite nice that not very many people saw it. It's achieved a transcendent status now. While it was alive and kicking everybody thought it was a rather tasteless parody and now it's been burned and gone up to heaven it's seen as a transcendent work of art.\" </p> <p>Craig-Martin put a counterword in for posterity. \"There are people who have lost great swathes of work who are not the most famous people. But who's to know whether they may come to be seen as of greater importance in 50 to 100 years. This is possibly the worst moment for artists: when you're superseded by the next generation, that's when you look at your worst, that's the hardest moment, really, the moment before rediscovery.\" </p> <p><strong>Paintings were not insured </strong></p> <p>If you want to know why anyone in the south of England needs a four-wheel drive car, try visiting Gillian Ayres in her house on the Devon-Cornwall border, after the monsoon rains of a global-warming August, without a decent map, in a rented Peugeot the size of a shoebox. Ayres, who is 74 years old, plied me with ham sandwiches and wine when I arrived, an hour late. The house, part of which is about 600 years old, smelled hospitably of old upholstery, furniture polish and roast meat. Recently, but before the fire, Ayres suffered a heart attack, and moves around with the aid of a stick. She still drives and paints her enormous canvases in the studio in the house but doesn't get to her native London as often as she used to. </p> <p>Ayres lost 18 paintings in the fire: five of her own, two belonging to her sons, and 11 belonging to her friend Shirley Conran. Due to a recent oversight on her part the ones belonging to Ayres were not insured and she, together with Conran, has hired a lawyer, Razi Mireskandari, with a view to suing Momart for negligence - an accusation Momart denies. It is a sad conclusion to a long relationship: Ayres got to know the founder of Momart, Jim Moyes, in the 1970s, when he was just starting out. They have been friends ever since, though Moyes left the company some years ago - partly, he told me recently, because of the change of atmosphere there after the investment company 3i bought into it. In those early days, when Ayres lived in Wales, Moyes sometimes used to stay the weekend when he came to pick up paintings. </p> <p>The only Momart warehouse Ayres ever saw, she said, was the firm's showcase operation at its headquarters in Richmond Road, Hackney, which, she recalls, had automatic fireproof doors. She says she did not know her work was actually being stored in a rented warehouse in Leyton. \"We got bills and it was always 'Momart, Richmond Road'. And I thought that's where the paintings were because one has used that place for 20 years, since the 80s ... I had no idea they'd farmed them out to various other places.\" </p> <p>\"It was a perfectly nice afternoon here, and in fact my son was here,\" said Ayres, remembering the day she heard about what had happened. \"He thought I was asleep and I wasn't, I was reading in the kitchen, and they phoned, Momart phoned, and said: 'All your work's gone. There was a fire, and we think it's all gone.' And ... well, nothing really happened much then.\" What was her immediate reaction? </p> <p>\"Well ... 'Fucking hell!' </p> <p>You don't expect them to turn to ashes in a few hours. It isn't something you think of. It's a very lonely business being an artist. You shut yourself up and do all this bloody work and - it's gone! And so I felt a bit - my son cried, but no, I didn't burst into tears.\" She did, she admitted, feel \"a bit glum\". She went off to do some printmaking as solace. Ayres leafed through a book of her paintings, pointing out the ones that had burned. \"Altair. It's a great big 10 by 10 and it's gone. Funnily enough that one's gone. That one's in the British Council ... that's gone ... that's gone ... well, what saved them is when people have got them, I suppose ... that's gone. Lord Gowrie used to have that one but I'm not sure if he still has, and I'm not sure if I know where it is, but anyway, it's alive, I think. That one's gone. </p> <p>\"I think you probably hope that you do give people something. There's a painting of mine in Birmingham city gallery and they said they actually had to put a barrier up because children ran towards it. I think certainly you are aiming at something like this. I think you probably hope they're there for a thousand years. I mean I don't know - there's deep colour rot, all sorts of things but ... bang, it's a cinder in five minutes.\" </p> <p>Ayres didn't see the media mockery of the burned artworks. But she was hurt by reports of a function at the Tate shortly after the fire which gave her the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota was only concerned about the loss to Britart. (Subsequently, Serota has made clear that he understands the fire was \"a far greater disaster for British art than most people know\" and that it affected \"scores of artists and collectors, way beyond Charles [Saatchi]\".) </p> <p>Craig-Martin said he thought there was an unusual, peculiarly British divide between the abstract expressionists who flourished in the 1960s and 1970s and the artists who came to prominence in the 1990s. What stood between them was the 1980s, the decade of Thatcher, and of Saatchi, the man who sold her and went on to revolutionise the collecting of British art. </p> <p>\"The 70s were a very difficult period to live in Britain, it was not easy, there was very little money and there were great stresses socially, and then Mrs Thatcher came along and turned the entire thing upside down in a way that's completely extraordinary, and then by the 90s you have a culture that has changed its values. Very few countries do this in quite such a dramatic manner. When I go back to America, where I grew up, it may be more extreme in certain ways than it was in the 60s or 50s but it's not culturally different. Whereas the country I came to in 1960 has disappeared. </p> <p>\"There was an absolutely clear art world in New York in 1966. Virtually every artist was represented by a gallery in some way. You have a fabric of an art world, which is there is a kind of critical discourse going on among artists in relation to critics, there are galleries exhibiting the newest work, there are collectors purchasing some of this work. When I came to Britain, I found an extraordinary vitality of artists, a tiny number of contemporary galleries, and an even smaller number of collectors. Most of those galleries survived by selling works by British artists to foreigners. Now, there's an exaggerated sense of money and celebrity: one went from a situation here where private galleries and collectors almost didn't exist to the other extreme.\" </p> <p>Emerging from either side of that great ridge of the Thatcher years, united by fire apparently only in the most arbitrary way, the heterogenous Chapmans and Ayres nonetheless overlap in the simplest and most important sense: they make their art, firstly, for themselves. \"We don't make work for people to buy,\" said Dinos Chapman. \"We make it so that we can look at it.\" Ayres said something similar: \"I personally don't work for you, or anybody.\" And she laughed. </p> <p><strong>Hell will be reborn</strong> </p> <p>Craigie Horsfield and his Polish wife Ewa had guests coming round one morning towards the end of May and, to air their terraced house in Hackney, they opened the windows. A pungent smell of burning rubber filled the rooms and Carrer Muntaner was made was not the Craigie Horsfield of now. \"The conditions of your actually making it are very specific to that particular time of your thinking about it, the decisions about whether it looked right, whether you choose this particular negative, what it's intended to do within the project,\" he said. </p> <p>Horsfield pointed out of the window, to where the afternoon sun was slanting through leaves. \"The light changes from moment to moment,\" he said. \"Although in the afternoon you think the only thing that's changing is the sun going down, it's actually not. There are all kinds of things. The angle of light changes not only the shadows but the areas between shadows. Everything we see is changing all of the time, even at night, whether there's a moon or not.\" </p> <p>Carrer Muntaner had no glass or gloss. It had a matt surface \"like skin\", said Horsfield, which was intended to transform the photograph from souvenir of past time to something more like an eternal present. As he talked, describing the intricate layers of Catalan history represented by the architecture in the picture, and as we looked at the mean little reproduction in a book, I began to feel a deep sense of regret that I would never get to see the original of a photograph which until a few days earlier I had never heard of. </p> <p>\"People die in a lifetime who are a dreadful loss, and who you regret decades later, even realising, in the inevitability of time, death comes along, and I think of my father, who died 20 years ago, and yet I still regret his loss, sometimes desperately,\" said Horsfield. He stared at the reproduction. \"This is what I spent 35 years of my life trying to escape from, precisely because it's so much not what it was. It was rougher, it was physically there. Whereas here, it's just a photograph of a city.\" </p> <p>Some of the burned artists are, nonetheless, thinking about remaking their works. When I first called Dinos Chapman he asked me to call him back because he was \"glueing skeletons together\". Later he said he and his brother were already preparing themselves to redo Hell, only to backtrack into ambiguity. \"There's nothing wrong with a bit of forest clearance because it allows new things to come out, rather than fetishise something that's more or less served its purpose. And there's always the possibility of actually revisiting and remaking something along the lines of Hell,\" he said. </p> <p>I spoke to Dinos again this week: he revealed that, indeed, Hell was to be reborn, albeit in another guise. \"It would be a stupid waste of time to remake that [original] but we are going to make a sculpture that will be a bigger, better version. It will be small figures on a large diorama.\" </p> <p>In an interview with Irvine Welsh in the New York style magazine Black Book, Damien Hirst said he was undecided. \"With technology today things can be remade, so there's a dilemma as to what is the most important thing - what the artist was trying to communicate at the time, or the actual object itself? I've lost about 17 paintings now, the spin paintings, and I can make another spin painting, but it would never be the same as the ones I've lost.\" </p> <p>Paul Le Boutillier, a fine art insurance broker with Heath Lambert - Momart's insurers - said he had known of cases where artists agreed to remake work for owners. \"They charge us for their time,\" he said. \"Other artists have point-blank refused, saying they could never recapture the essence or the moment. Some artists refused to allow fire-damaged artwork to be sold under their name. </p> <p>\"I remember when I was younger, photography claims were quite troublesome. I think a lot of people would react the same way: 'Why don't you just print another one?' It's a controversy that's been raging very quietly in my world for quite a long time. But I'm an insurance broker. If a client presents something to me which I can present to an underwriter, I will arrange them a policy.\" </p> <p>Leboutillier had little sympathy for the uninsured. \"We understand that people do get very emotional about their artwork and that we are insuring something unique, but when it comes to the question of somebody who simply hasn't purchased insurance, it does open your eyes to the fact that insurance is a business.\" Without insurance, the rules are that Momart pays out according to the same treaty which governs compensation for air travellers whose baggage is destroyed, the Warsaw Convention. The weight of Redgrave's sculpture and Ayres' paintings will be estimated, and compensation paid out at the rate of 60 cents a pound. </p> <p><strong>'Momart is blameless' </strong></p> <p>In June, police arrested a man on suspicion of burglary at the unit where the fire broke out. He has still not been charged, and is due to be seen by the police again next month. I asked Momart about the concerns of Conran, Ayres and Redgrave, about why the company used space inside a building occupied by other businesses, and what fire monitoring systems, if any, had been in place. No one from Momart was prepared to be interviewed. In an email, the firm's managing director, Eugene Boyle, said: \"We are pleased that the majority [of our clients] seem to feel that Momart is blameless, and continue to give us their full support. We do also recognise that some clients will naturally feel angry at the loss of their property, and will cast around for someone to blame. However, we feel it is clear that we are all victims of a criminal act perpetrated on one of our neighbours located some distance away.\" Boyle declined to say whether Momart had fitted the Goldstar Removals warehouse with modern fire protection systems. </p> <p>No one knows how much insurers will pay out in total as a result of the Momart fire. A figure of \u00a350 million has been suggested, but it is the roughest of guesses. Unlike the artists who have lost work, the financial world will absorb the losses without a quiver. \"The loss disappears far beyond the art world,\" said Le Boutillier. </p> <p>\"It just disappears somewhere into the vast sea of zeroes floating between computers in the insurance market.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/britartfire/story/0,14634,1310814,00.html\">Read the first part of James Meek's investigation</a></p>",
  "To anyone who has lived in the north, it's a matter for wonder and awe that, until Alun Michael, the rural affairs minister, was effectively banned from going there, many people down south had never heard of the Forest of Bowland. Michael's destination for this thwarted tryst with the ramblers was Abbeystead, in the north-west corner, where the Duke of Westminster has one of his opulent homes and fine estates. <p>But when I was there on a dazzling evening in early September, with the sense that a summer that had hardly been born was now dying, the villages in the south-east were a match for any part of the tract of moorland, woods and dazzling rivers known as the Forest. At Dunsop Bridge, where people sat in the sun enjoying that sense of peace and harmony that such places engender, the green by the river was covered in ducks (no rare occurrence, apparently: the post office/shop calls itself Puddleduck's). </p> <p>Slaidburn, a solid stone community on the top of the hill, has a pub called Hark to Bounty, a church that is warmly commended by Simon Jenkins and an 18th century grammar school now converted into the village primary. And beyond them is no less enchanting Bolton by Bowland. About the best thing in Lancashire, one is tempted to say. Except that for some who live in these parts, it's still, 30 years after the government shifted the county boundary, essentially Yorkshire. </p> <p>People still yearn for the restoration of Yorkshire as some used to yearn through the commonwealth years for the restoration of kingship. Slaidburn's website makes its Lancashire allegiance sound temporary. \"A small hill village in the Bowland region of the historic county of Yorkshire,\" it says. \"The area is currently administered by Lancashire County Council ... \" </p> <p>The 1974 dispensation that moved these villages, along with Grindleton, Waddington and others, from white rose to red rose territory was part of a wider plan that lopped sizeable chunks off Lancashire to go into the great conurbations, or into Cumbria and Cheshire. This favoured corner of what until then had been the West Riding was no doubt regarded in Whitehall as some form of compensation. </p> <p>The restiveness that can be found in Lancashire-that-used-to-be-Yorkshire is replicated in Saddleworth, which was unwillingly thrust into Greater Manchester in 1974. The parish council passed a resolution at the end of its last year making its official address: Civic Hall, Lee Street, Uppermill, Saddleworth, Yorkshire. </p> <p>The council (only one of whose members dissented) can claim an official, even a royal, warrant for that: \"I can confirm,\" the then local government minister, a Mr Portillo, would later assure the Commons, \"that the local authority areas and boundaries introduced in April 1974 do not alter the boundaries of counties. The 1974 boundaries are entirely administrative and need not affect long-standing loyalties and affinities.\" While in September 2001, Prince Charles, opening a Yorkshire canal, said: \"The fact that Saddleworth is still part of the historic West Riding is extremely important.\" </p> <p>There's a name for such territories: debatable lands. That's a 15th or 16th century designation, which Walter Scott's novels made popular, and which originally applied to a stretch of land between the rivers Esk and Sark, north of Carlisle and south of Langholm. This was sometimes England, sometimes Scotland, and often effectively neither, since the writ of neither country applied as the great border families fought and feuded across it. </p> <p>The term \"debatable lands\" has always seemed to me a deeply romantic concept, with the same emotional pull as knights at arms, alone and palely loitering. So it's no surprise to discover that the British Association for Romantic Studies will be holding a conference next July, organised by Professor Claire Lamont and Dr Michael Rossington of the University of Newcastle, on the theme of debatable lands - at home and abroad (<a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/bars2005/debatable_lands/\">ncl.ac.uk/bars2005/debatable_lands/</a>). </p> <p>It's a concept that goes beyond mere geography. As the conference site on the internet indicates, it applies to all kinds of areas where borders are hazy or in some way disputed. Macaulay wrote of history as \"the debatable land between reason and imagination\". A classic spiritualist work, commended by Alfred Russel Wallace, was called \"The debatable land between this world and the next\". </p> <p>Bids to speak at the conference have to be in by mid-October. As you'd expect where debatable lands are involved, there are no arbitrary boundaries on its agenda. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:McElsewhere@aol.com\">McElsewhere@aol.com</a></p>",
  "About two hours into the Beslan school siege, two local men stood by a garage about 10 metres from the ongoing carnage addressing issues of North Ossetia's autonomy. One - squat, unshaven, smelling of last night's moonshine and holding an ancient hunting rifle - turned to the other and said: \"The federal troops are doing a sweep of the building. But that's not their right. We, the local militia, should do that. It's our school.\" <p>The carnage at Beslan was equalled in severity only by the chaos. Moscow seemed to have washed its hands of the entire event. Groups of incredibly brave young Russian interior ministry special forces did the bulk of the fighting. Ten of the country's elite Alpha troops lost their lives. But much of the violence and, it appears, the shooting that caused the gunmen to set off their bombs, came from local militia men. None of Russia's experienced siege experts had thought to erect a barrier to keep these men out. </p> <p>Today the school remains open to the public, a sort of freakish museum designed to entice the fuming local population into further anger and grief. Four days after the siege kids played with bits of flesh left from the militants. An unexploded tank shell sat in the centre of the playground. A Swiss journalist was apparently chased by armed men, who thought he was a terrorist. Moscow had still not taken control. </p> <p>Now, nearly three weeks since the siege's end, the Kremlin has used the tragedy to boost its power over the regions, and push through a redesign of parliament to make it yet more servile to the Putin administration. The foreign ministry has busied itself with complaining about the political asylum in London of the Chechen Akhmed Zakayev, a man whom the security services admit is obsolete within the militant movement. </p> <p>Georgia, where Russia claims militants find refuge, cowers at the threat of pre-emptive strikes. Yet the border between North Ossetia and Ingushetia, where some of the militants came from, remains poorly guarded, despite growing talk of inter-ethnic war. </p> <p>Such a total lack of control and, it seems, interest in the conclusion and aftermath of the Beslan tragedy is somewhat ironic if we recall the issue that got us here in the first place. The Chechen conflict has smouldered for more than a decade because of Russia's insistence on sovereignty: its territorial integrity. Yet in Beslan, and even in Chechnya, Russian sovereignty appears to be a purely nominal issue, and one that does not carry with it any actual responsibility in government. Chechnya, a broken, brutalised country, proved in 1997-98 to be incapable of governing itself without succumbing to the excesses of sharia law and human rights abuses as bad as those inflicted on the population by Russian troops. It has also proved itself to be the source of Islamic extremism in a region where Muslim radicalism is flaring up. Europe, as a whole, has an interest in ensuring this back door remains secure. </p> <p>Yet Moscow, as the Beslan siege amply demonstrated, has not managed to do that. It hasn't stopped the militants from getting so radical that their atrocities defy language. It didn't even set up a proper cordon around the siege until two hours after it had finished. </p> <p>North Ossetia is not Chechnya, yet it is suffering from the same Kremlin indifference to the people in its southern republics. Muscovites often fear North Caucasians as a strange, unpredictable, fiery people, who are best suppressed and avoided. </p> <p>Even President Putin has been to Grozny so few times that during his last visit he remarked at how bad it looked from the helicopter. One would have thought he - and his audience - already knew that. He ordered the city to be carpet-bombed for the second time only four years ago. </p> <p>Putin tried to make all the right noises about preserving order and stability in the region. The town is supposed to have been sealed since the siege. Yet the entire republic remains open. Maybe Moscow has decided to let the North Ossetians get on with their revenge and mourning. Maybe it's decided that it's just too dangerous to get involved in their mess. </p> <p>Or, more worryingly, maybe Putin gave an order, yet found his law enforcement organs too corrupt and incompetent to carry it out. This is the key problem with Putin's police state. Moscow can restrict movement, pass new laws and beef up security, but there is no one to enforce these whims. At a security check in Moscow airport the week after the siege, a policewoman was taking down names of passengers arriving from the south. She asked me how to spell my name. A queue formed, and two colleagues barged through the line and left. No one noticed. </p> <p>Mr Putin is trying to build a police state without a functional police force. His chief prosecutor has admitted corruption will make the fight against terror almost impossible. Yet the Kremlin's first moves have not been to introduce basic anti-corruption initiatives among police, border guards and officials, but instead to increase their own direct powers. Putin seems to still believe the Soviet myth that power commands obedience and respect, despite much of the country being left to its own devices. </p> <p>The Kremlin wants to have the North Caucasus as part of its domain, a fertile backwater that gives it geopolitical reach into the Caspian. But, from the Russian police force to the presidential administration, the idea of government is not accompanied by any sense of responsibility or accountability. So when Beslan needed federal intervention the most - on September 3 - it was left to its own, tragically chaotic devices. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Nick Paton Walsh is the Guardian's correspondent in Moscow </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.walsh@theguardian.com\">nick.walsh@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Conservatives will today seek to build on Michael Howard's tough new line on asylum and immigration by announcing a new campaigning strategy in Birmingham to demonstrate their determination to win back big city constituencies. <p>As Mr Howard's opponents savaged his plan to introduce a points system and an annual limit for inward migration, the Tories revealed that six of their chosen Birmingham candidates will campaign as a team to underline that people in cities face common problems. </p> <p>\"It acknowledges the fact that while a person may live in one city constituency, they may well work in another and socialise in another. Issues affecting the whole city affect them,\" the party co-chairman, Liam Fox, will explain. </p> <p>The Howard team has been criticised for failing to campaign seriously in urban byelections, and today's move is being presented as yet another innovative Tory campaign technique which could be adopted in other cities. </p> <p>In London Mr Howard promised that, if elected, he would: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Reintroduce embarkation controls and punish firms who employ people illegally; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Copy Australia and set a limit on those entering Britain to work; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Adopt the Australian points-based system for the evaluation of applications; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Pull out of the UN refugee convention and pull back from European convention on human rights restrictions, which will allow speedier treatment of asylum cases; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Reduce the numbers entering Britain by curbing work permits. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, said the needs of employers should dictate the shape of the labour market.</p>",
  "<p>Hank McKinnell, chief executive of Pfizer, the largest, richest, most powerful drug company in the world, with a global headquarters in New York and close links to the US government, opted to spend several days this year being heckled and harangued by the activists at the international Aids conference in Bangkok, a biannual event that has become notorious for the trashing of drug company stalls, the panning of America and the throwing of red paint. McKinnell was the only drug company boss there. </p> <p>Why would a man who earns more than $20m a year and was named 11th in the Fortune rankings of the world's most powerful business leaders, do that? Well, there were contacts to make, he says, but that was not all. \"I'm really here because I believe just as we ask our parents and grandparents what they did in the second world war, I think our children and grandchildren will ask us what we did at the beginning of the HIV/Aids pandemic.\" </p> <p>A few years ago, neither drug companies nor governments showed much concern. But in 2000, when the Aids conference went to the heart of the pandemic in Durban, South Africa, everything changed. </p> <p>\"I think the activism at that meeting caused the world to realise that we had to do something extraordinary here and out of that meeting and in the last four years the world looks quite different - pharmaceuticals are available at very low cost and governments are putting money in. There is not enough yet being done on infrastructure but a lot has been accomplished.\" </p> <p>Some may be surprised by McKinnell's willingness to credit the activists, who consider him part of the problem for insisting on the sanctity of drug patents, which keep prices high. But McKinnell, like a number of high-ranking politicians and businessmen, has been to Africa </p> <p>\"You can't visit Africa and see the epidemic without it affecting you emotionally,\" he says. \"I've been in orphanages with 50 to 60 one- and two-year-olds, all HIV positive. I know they're not going to survive without major intervention for more than six or seven years. All these kids want is a chance to live.\" </p> <p>McKinnell thinks Pfizer has been misunderstood. It was not involved in the notorious South African court case in which 39 drug companies sued the government to block it from importing cheap drugs from other countries. \"Pfizer was not a part of that decision. We thought that was a bad idea. We did not join the lawsuit. The basis of our business is being able to sell medicines to those who can afford them and our part of the bargain is to make them available to those who cannot afford them.\" </p> <p>But there were negotiations. \"Not really. Both sides were kind of dysfunctional frankly,\" he says, adding an extraordinary comment from the arch-defender of drug patents: \"The pharmaceutical industry was kind of standing on their patent rights and I don't know what the government was trying to do. They're only now coming around to an effective programme. I think both sides deserved each other.\" </p> <p>He denies that Pfizer was pushed into donating its drug Diflucan, which treats fungal infections that otherwise kill people whose immune systems are weakened by the HIV virus. He reels off figures: Diflucan is now donated in 22 countries, more than 4m doses have been supplied, 18,000 healthcare professionals have been trained in the use of the drug and 900 clinics can now dispense it in sub-Saharan Africa. \"That didn't exist four years ago,\" he says. \"I know of no other organisation that's done that.\" </p> <p>But he is still criticised. M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res and Oxfam say donations are unsustainable, and depend on the goodwill of the company, that companies like them because they gen erate tax breaks but that they come with strings attached and doctors have to prescribe what they have been given rather than asking for what they need. Rock-bottom prices for poor people are a better long-term answer. </p> <p>McKinnell deftly kicks the sustainability argument into the long grass. \"I don't know why anybody would think an NGO dependent on public funding would be somehow more sustainable than a $50bn corporation like Pfizer that's 155 years old,\" he says. \"We said with the Diflucan programme that the drug will be available for patients we are serving as long as they live. Will we renege on that promise and go away? Sure, we might, just like an NGO might or a government might. Governments are running these programmes too and governments change.There's no sure thing in this world. But we have been around for 155 years.\" </p> <p>But his hard line appears to be soft ening. He has two promising Aids drugs in the pipeline. If they get to market, will he donate them to Africa? \"I don't know yet,\" he replied. \"It depends on the circumstances of each individual market and each individual product and I don't doubt some of them would be donated.\" </p> <p>One of those drugs, Capravirine, known as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, might be useful in cases where the virus has become resistant to other drugs. The other, known only as UK-427 (it was invented in the Pfizer UK base in Sandwich, Kent), is potentially more exciting because it belongs to a new class which attempts to block the virus from entering cells. </p> <p>But this sort of research, from which Africa may benefit in the long term McKinnell says, can only continue if the rich world pays enough for its drugs. He warns that Europe is playing a dangerous game. \"I'm particularly concerned about the policies of some European governments. If they're not willing to support the research-based industry, if they're not willing to pay reasonable prices for new medicines, and continue paying very high prices for old medicines, they're going to destroy the research base in Europe, which is almost done already.\" </p> <p>Pfizer has closed research centres already this year in France, Germany and Italy. \"They've basically become countries that don't welcome innovation ... Increasingly what's happening is that companies are unable to launch new medicines in Europe because the government is insisting on ever-lower prices. And that's just becoming politically unsupportable in the US.\" </p> <p>In fact, low European prices have become a point of contention with Americans who are increasingly aware that they pay the highest prices in the world to companies making vast profits. Many pensioners now travel to Canada and Mexico to get medicines cheaper. But the answer for McKinnell is not lower US prices. Healthcare costs continue to rise in Europe in spite of the clampdown on drug prices and \"hundreds of thousands of high-paid jobs\" are disappearing to America, he says. \"I think we may see a change in European policy. We're going to have to.\" </p> <p>McKinnell switches easily from hardball to softball, one moment attacking European governments and the next describing how Pfizer's Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala will tackle the infrastructure problems that the drug companies always said were a bigger obstacle to treating Aids in Africa than drug prices. It will train 200 doctors, who each agree to train 10 more. </p> <p>\"The point is not that this is an appropriate answer to the challenge, because it's not,\" he says. \"But think if 100 companies or 1,000 companies did the same thing, we'd start making real progress.\" </p> <p>He'll be there for the official launch next month, personally convinced, whatever the activists shout at him, that he will be able to tell his grandchildren he did what he could to help turn around the biggest health crisis in history. Without, of course, compromising the interests of one of the most powerful companies on the planet.</p>"
