  "<p>Shefki Kuqi was the star of <strong> Finland </strong> 's 3-1 victory over Armenia in Helsinki, which put them level with <strong> Romania</strong> on points in Group 1. </p> <p>The Ipswich striker gave Finland an early lead and completed the scoring three minutes from time. Earlier, Armen Shakhgeldyan pulled a goal back for Armenia shortly after Aleksei Eremenko had doubled the lead.</p> <p><strong>Romania</strong> were certain to remain top of the group, having already beaten Finland, but lost 1-0 to a Jan Koller penalty for the <strong>Czech Republic</strong> . </p> <p><strong>Sweden</strong> beat <strong>Hungary</strong> 3-0 in Group 8 late on, with goals from Fredrik Ljungberg, Henrik Larsson and Anders Svensson. </p> <p>In Africa, <strong> Libya</strong> went top of Group 3 with a 2-1 victory over <strong> Egypt </strong> , though Cameroon were hoping to join them on 10 points with victory in Sudan last night and Ivory Coast can reach the same mark by winning in Benin today.</p> <p><strong>Tunisia </strong> 's hopes in Group 5 were damaged by a 2-2 draw in <strong> Malawi </strong> , though this represented an escape for the African champions, who scored twice in the last 10 minutes to secure their point.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> and the <strong>Solomon Islands</strong> will meet in a World Cup play-off next year, to decide who goes forward from Oceania to play the fifth-placed team in South America for a place in the finals.

  "<p>Its looking like a group of long, drawn-out death already. Who in their right minds would pick a winner - or even a runner-up - for this intensely close slog for a World Cup prize in two years' time. Three games in and as we stand four nations (Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland, France, Israel) are locked together on five points.</p> <p>Ireland earned a well-deserved draw and heaped discomfort on a France side who look increasingly unhappy under the current regime.</p> <p>There was no underestimating the significance of this fixture between two sides who fancy themselves for automatic qualification as Group 4 winners. Although it was as well that the Irish were in town, as otherwise there would have been no clue of a sellout international in Paris. During the afternoon the only people demonstrating their faith on the banks of the Seine who were not wearing green were Hare Krishnas. Once inside the stadium, the estimated 30,000 Irish leant volume to the home team's national anthem by jigging and la-la-la-ing through the Marseillais. Extraordinary. No mistaking whose veins were coursing with optimism.</p> <p>France desperately needed a boost to stop the current mood of disillusionment becoming too entrenched. L'Equipe 's banner headline had warned that this was 'the moment of truth'. Raymond Domenech's brief reign has been so heavily undermined by player unrest, disappointing form and media bullets that his position is said, by some, to depend upon this set of games (they take on Cyprus, in Nicosia, on Wednesday night).</p> <p>It was a huge test of the inexperience evident in the heart of the team: the central defensive partnership of Sebastien Squillaci and Ga\u00ebl Givet took the field with six caps between them, while in front of them Rio Antonio Mavuba, an Angolan famously born on a refugee boat off the African coast, started for the first time in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira.</p> <p>With the midfield battleground obviously up for grabs, Brian Kerr plumped for Kevin Kilbane's energy to dovetail with the old warrior Roy Keane. The ex-captain seized the initiative from the off with a delicious through-ball to Clinton Morrison, who couldn't quite react quickly enough to test Fabien Barthez. A golden chance.</p> <p>Half-chances came fairly regularly - Steve Finnan cut inside and shot straight at Barthez, Morrison squirted a header wide, Robbie Keane and Damien Duff were blocked in the same move. Ireland were in their element, determined to show confidence and aggression before France could find any kind of groove. Just who was at home here?</p> <p>Robert Pires made himself the visiting public's enemy numero un when he went down easily to win a free-kick a yard outside the penalty area and was consistently jeered afterwards. France looked rudderless for the first half-hour - no evidence that they were gelling more as a team (either technically or spiritually) under Domenech's idiosyncratic stewardship. But with half-time approaching they began to exert some pressure, as William Gallas and Pires tested Given with awkward shots.</p> <p>Gallas, pushing up whenever possible, found considerable space to attack. Consequently limiting his Chelsea colleague, Damien Duff, who was forced to track back more often than Ireland would have liked. Attacking options were shifted slightly more five minutes before half-time when their main aerial threat, Clinton Morrison, shuffled off injured. </p> <p>His replacement, Andy Reid, whipped a shot that Barthez fumbled shortly after half-time, but Robbie Keane couldn't reach the loose ball. France, sensing the gravity of the situation, responded and should have taken the lead when Pires found Gallas from a free-kick, only for the defender to scuff it. Then Djibril Ciss\u00e9 saw a firm shot blocked.</p> <p>Back came Ireland, Duff volleying from a pinballed corner to lift the Irish spirits. The game was tensing up, tight as a snare drum, with both teams aware of how critical this tussle could be come the final group reckoning.</p> <p>France, requiring experience and nerve, could have done without Olivier Dacourt limping out and giving way for a debutant replacement in Alou Diarra. (How good did Claude Makelele and Zinedine Zidane, who retired from the international scene in the summer, feel watching on at home?) They could also have done without Barthez clowning around inside his box just when they needed calm heads.</p> <p>Ireland smelled blood. Keane glanced a header at Barthez and then John O'Shea was oh-so-close, steering a volley fractionally wide of the far post from Reid's free-kick.</p> <p>Given was more heroic at the other end, stretching to paw away a rare chance for Thierry Henry. Honours even, although a good deal of the honour here, it must be said, went to the thousands of travelling Irish.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The stars are Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken. The director is Tony Scott, known for blockbusters such as Top Gun and Crimson Tide. But the identity of the writer of Man on Fire, the bestseller that hits the big screen in Britain this weekend, has been a riddle for a quarter of a century. Until now. <p>The film, starring Washington as a mercenary bodyguard, has been a hit in America, and the book on which it is based has sold 7.4 million copies worldwide in 20 languages. It is credited simply to 'AJ Quinnell', the pseudonym of a man about whom virtually nothing is known. </p> <p>Now Quinnell has broken a 25-year silence to give The Observer his first newspaper interview. The enigma behind 12 books that have earned a cult following around the globe - four more are under option in Hollywood - is revealed as a thrice-married Briton who travelled the world, took up his pen after a chance encounter with the Mafia and borrowed his alter ego from a Welsh rugby player. </p> <p>Man on Fire is a critically praised story of a kidnapping in Italy (the movie version transfers it to Mexico). Now in his early sixties, Quinnell recalled the Mafia's role in its genesis: 'I was flying from Tokyo to Hong Kong, and the man next to me had a heart attack. He was elderly and obviously very wealthy, dripping with gold. The flight crew were going to call an ambulance from the general hospital, which would have been a disaster, because it's a huge government hospital and not very efficient. But I knew the captain and persuaded him to call a private hospital instead. </p> <p>'Two days later, a lot of young men in smart suits turned up. It transpired the man was a member of one of the old Italian families. They said if I ever needed help I should get in contact. The man subsequently died, but when it came to researching my book, I had the name of his son, who put me in touch with his lawyer in Rome, who put me in touch with various people I wanted to talk to. </p> <p>'They didn't actually come out of it very well: the juxtaposition of the violence that went on in those days with the very kind people I met at the hospital was extraordinary. When I wrote the book, I said to them I'd change all their names, but they refused. I said, \"Look, you all die terribly.\" They said, \"We don't care, we want to be in the book,\" so I left them in.' </p> <p>Quinnell has repeatedly shunned publicity and few of his publishers know his real name, which he asked The Observer not to disclose. He explained: 'When I was finishing that book, I had another at the back of my mind, The Mahdi, long before the Salman Rushdie fatwa. It wasn't particularly anti-Islamic, but it was a spy story which involved Islam, Mecca and so on. I wanted freedom of movement, so I decided to take a pen name at that point. </p> <p>'I chose the name Quinnell when I was in a bar at home. My agent rang me up and said, \"Look, if you want a pen name, give it to me now because they need to start printing.\" I used to play a lot of rugby and remembered the Welsh player Derek Quinnell. I sent that off and the agent came back and said, \"You need initials or a first name.\" The bartender's son was AJ, so I took that. </p> <p>'Curiously enough, when you use a pen name and no one knows your real name, not even your publisher, you get people who suddenly tell their friends they're AJ Quinnell. It can be a little strange.' </p> <p>Quinnell - who still writes in longhand using a felt-tip pen - was born in Nuneaton during a German air raid. His childhood was spent in Tanzania and at boarding school in West Yorkshire. At 20, he became a trader in Hong Kong. He has been married for nine years to Elsebeth Egholm, a detective novelist 20 years his junior. They divide their time between her native Denmark and what he describes - with an air of mystery - as 'an island in the Mediterranean'. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.smith@observer.co.uk\">david.smith@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The thriller <strong> Man on Fire</strong>, according to the production notes, 'marked the culmination of a 20-year odyssey by director Tony Scott', which is twice the time it took Ulysses to get from Troy to Ithaca (though the latter did not manage to make Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop II along the way). </p> <p>This is a characteristic Scott movie in the high-octane blockbuster style he learnt working for Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, taking him down Mexico way, where he went in the late Eighties for a similar trip, called Revenge . </p> <p>This is that dark, dangerous Mexico, 'so far from God, so near the United States,' as Porfirio Diaz put it. The burned-out, alcoholic Creasy (Denzel Washington) goes there to act as bodyguard to Pita (Dakota Fanning), the 10-year-old daughter of a rich Mexican businessman and his blonde American wife (Radha Mitchell). He's a former assassin for the US government's counter-insurgency division and in search of redemption. </p> <p>'Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?' he asks his old CIA chum, Christopher Walken. After reluctantly bonding with his young charge, Creasy is nearly killed when she's kidnapped and drags himself from his bed to go on a rampage, torturing and killing anyone associated with the abduction. </p> <p>Adapted by Brian Helgeland from a 1980 novel set in Italy, the movie has been switched to Mexico City because it's now the world capital of kidnapping for profit (though Baghdad probably holds the title pro tem) and the place is presented as a polluted hell, rotten to the core. </p> <p>Only an honest middle-aged cop and a crusading journalist stand up to the universal corruption and they unite in helping to unleash Creasy. It's an exciting tale, roughly an hour too long, and marred as always by Scott's self-conscious artiness, a legacy of days shooting commercials. There's slow motion, fast motion, hectic editing, pounding music and even the sub-titles are designed to jump up and hit you between the eyes. Denzel Washington is his commanding, jaw-clenching self and Dakota Fanning (whose name sounds to me like a Midwest company manufacturing air-conditioners) shows once again that she's the most accomplished child actor at work today.</p>",
  "<b>Israel kills Hamas commander in Gaza</b> <br> Israeli troops killed five armed Palestinians in Gaza yesterday as Israel continued with a major offensive in the area. The dead included a local commander of Hamas militants in Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp. Earlier in the day, troops killed two militants in a gunfight at nearby Beit Hanoun and two Palestinian policeman in a missile strike on another refugee camp. <p><b>Saucy charity refused</b><br> A group of Californian women, aged 51 to 84, who posed for a racy calendar and raised $30,000 for Carmel-by-the-Sea's firefighters have had their money returned. Officials said taking the money would open the town to potential lawsuits. 'It would open us up to workplace causes of action such as sexual harassment,' said one. </p> <p><b>Union boss detained</b><br> Security forces detained a labour leader threatening a nationwide strike by oil industry workers in Nigeria. Authorities picked up Adams Oshiomhole, president of the Nigeria Labour Congress, at the international airport in Abuja yesterday. Talks between union and government failed to agree on fuel prices, setting the stage for a general strike. </p> <p><b>Haitian beheadings</b><br> Police in the Haitian capital of Port au Prince found a father and son beheaded yesterday, bringing the number of decapitations to seven in a week. Violence has erupted after loyalists of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide stepped up demands for his return.</p>",
  "They seem to have little in common: a right-wing New Zealander who transformed his party's fortunes with hardline rhetoric on race, and Tony Blair's famously pessimistic polling guru. <p>But senior Tories have alighted on both Don Brash, leader of the New Zealand National Party, and focus group king Philip Gould as they scour the globe seeking ideas to steal for the next election. Gould may be a surprising choice, but shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin - who last week confessed to buying his book about Blairism, The Unfinished Revolution - admits that the pollster's argument that the ground must be carefully and repeatedly softened up ahead of major policy changes provided inspiration for his own strategy on tax. </p> <p>'One of the things that struck me most [about the book] is that if you are going to say \"X\" at a given moment, you need to have said \"A, B, C, D, E, F\" before you get to X in order that X is read in the way you mean it,' Letwin said. </p> <p>Gould argues that endless repetition of ideas is essential because voters tune into politics so intermittently - a tactic in evidence at last week's Tory party conference, where most of the policies 'unveiled' had already been announced, some by Iain Duncan Smith's regime. </p> <p>Letwin admitted 'we have all been reading everything we could find about campaigns that were successful', including John Howard's 1990s comeback in Australia and George Bush's 2000 election. </p> <p>However, the most intriguing inspiration for last week's tough talk on crime and immigration - tempered by Michael Howard's emotional recollections of his immigrant past - is Brash, who met the Tory leader for private talks in the summer. </p> <p>Elected leader shortly before Howard's own coronation, Brash interests Tory strategists because he inherited a similarly despairing party. Unlike Howard, he has demolished a 15-point Labour Party lead over his party with a populist platform of opposition to Maori rights, which he argues have disadvantaged poor indigenous whites, tough crime policies and attacks on the 'grievance industry' of reparations for infringements of minority rights. </p> <p>Allegations of playing the race card do not appear to have stuck - partly because his wife is Chinese, giving him similar credentials to Howard, the son of Jewish immigrants. The Tories' summer offensive on crime, immigration and the 'compensation culture' of suing for infringements of human rights suggests intriguing parallels. Maori rights was a 'hard issue for a lot of people to deal with without being accused of being racist', says one former National Party aide. </p> <p>'Brash made a speech in which he said we have to live as one people under one set of laws with no favouritism, and it really hit a chord with the public. The polling turned round within weeks.' </p> <p>Howard used his keynote conference speech to outline tough policies on drugs, crime and immigration, as did shadow Home Secretary David Davis. Liam Fox, the Tory co-chairman, told The Observer 's conference fringe meeting that Tories had been 'cowed by a left-leaning, politically correct culture' out of discussing asylum. </p> <p>While Howard has had little time for new policies, he did present them last week in new wrapping, devised largely by thirtysomething Michael Moszynski, who heads an offshoot of the M&amp;C Saatchi advertising empire called Immediate Sales. The agency offers what it calls 'brutal simplicity of thought' - the condensing of ideas into short, clear messages. </p> <p>Briefed to portray the party as one that 'gets things done', Moszynski devised the revamped Tory torch logo, borne by an arm with a rolled-up sleeve to indicate readiness for action. He also provided the slogan 'a timetable for action', involving ministers pledging to take certain actions within their first day in power. </p> <p>The final weapon was stardust: a dinner in London for celebrities to meet Howard - hosted by Charlotte Church's agent, Jonathan Shalitt- was followed by the arrival in Bournemouth of a train full of minor celebrities including a former girlfriend of Mick Jagger and LBC presenter Caroline Feraday. </p> <p>The emphasis on celebrity has, however, prompted wild thinking among some MPs unconvinced that a slick rebranding will win them the election. If Howard does badly, some are talking of a 'Schwarzenegger solution', making MP and television personality Boris Johnson leader to emulate the buzz created by the election of Schwarzenegger as governor of California. <br> <b>Spin vs Substance</b><br> <b> Spin</b> The Tories claim their polling shows that they are four points ahead in Labour's 130 most vulnerable seats. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> No one at Central Office has been able to explain the full details of the polling sample, raising doubts about the figure's reliability. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> Within the first week of a Conservative government, the Home Secretary will announce the ending of Labour's early release from prison scheme. Within the first week he will start his new prison-building programme. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> One of the reasons Labour has introduced the early release scheme is that prisons are full. It seems odd to promise that criminals will spend more of their sentence in prison before building new ones to house them. David Davis has yet to explain how he will square these policies. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> The Health Secretary will abolish targets imposed by Whitehall on hospitals. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> Introducing this on day one, rather than phasing it in, risks chaos. The Tories have not explained what the targets would be replaced with on day two. The whole NHS is geared up to hit targets and it is difficult to see what benefit would come from their immediate abandonment, however unpopular they are with health professionals. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> Within a month of coming to office, the Conservatives would publish a Bill introducing a presumption of co-parenting and equal rights for both parents in the case of separation. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> Children's Minister Margaret Hodge argues that the opposition has not seen fit to table an amendment to this effect in the Children Bill going through parliament and has not clarified whether this means the rights of the parents should have precedence over the rights of the child. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> Howard described from the platform a Saturday night out in Brixton where in two hours he didn't see a single policeman, suggesting inner cities were abandoned by the forces of law and order. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> Detective Chief Inspector Glynn Jones of Brixton suggested Howard should 'go and shove it'. The only recorded crimes that night were one robbery, one burglary and one serious incident. </p> <p><b> Martin Bright</b></p>",
  "<p>A good meal either wakes you up or sends you to sleep. As a rule, it is European food that makes me nod off, Asian food that fills me with zip and sparkle. Soporific suppers include any creamy pasta, polenta, risotto, sausage and mash, cassoulet or rice pudding. For a wake-up call I tend to tuck into sushi (though I'm not sure anyone is actually supposed to 'tuck into' sushi), clear soups, stir-fries, fish from the grill, Vietnamese salads, greens with oyster or chilli sauce, smoothies, ice cream and tropical fruits. If Sunday roast is my Mogodon, then chilli-spiked tom yum soup is my culinary alarm clock.</p> <p>I find aubergines especially sleep-inducing. Moussaka, with its layers of calming minced lamb, bland bechamel sauce and silkily tender aubergines, will have my head nodding before I've had time to lick my plate. Baked aubergines end with the vegetable's smooth flesh taking on a velvety olive-oily texture as soothing as a pair of (faux) fur-lined slippers. But I have always been one of those annoying people who could fall asleep standing up (I have suffered two nights' insomnia in my entire life) and live for food that sends the blood coursing through my veins. </p> <p>I finally picked the aubergines that have been ripening in pots on the back steps all summer. </p> <p>I grew two varieties, a short fat one where each fruit could win a gurning contest, and another that has produced long, elegant fruits. It seemed somewhat disrespectful to lose such an exquisite vegetable in a slurry of oniony mince. </p> <p>A more fitting end might be one where the vegetable is sent off in a sauce of spiritually uplifting seasonings such as ginger, chilli, lime leaves and coriander. What I fancied was a curry; one with the round, warm edges of an Indian curry, but with something of the fresh, clean notes of a Thai. So I made a few alterations to the green curry recipe I've made year in, year out. </p> <p>I chucked out the fish sauce and the lemon grass and included crushed cardamom and cumin seed to give a mellow note, then added the rounded citrus scent of coriander seed. What appeared in my bowl was a supper with all the zest of a freshly made green curry but with a mellow backnote. With a mound of quiet white rice to add a bit of substance, it became the best meal of the week. </p> <p>There have been some incredibly cheap figs in the shops this week. I bought two for a couple of quid; others say they got a whole trayful for the same price. I am not sure I could ever tire of eating the fruit straight, without any help from the oven, but having a surfeit does lead one to play about a bit. On Friday I made the simplest of all fruit tarts, only a few steps away from the classic French apple tarte. Just the skinniest layer of puff pastry (I used frozen - I'm no one's kitchen slave) and spliced fruit, baked then covered in a thin layer of glossy apple jelly. It rounded off the week nicely, a crisp spur-of-the-minute pastry and a pot of fragrant verbena tea. </p> <p><strong>Aubergine curry</strong></p> <p> This is quite hot and spicy. All of the ingredients can be picked up in a decent supermarket, though you may have to go to a Chinese or Thai shop for the fresh lime leaves. Dried are passable, but will have lost some of their magic. Serves 4 with rice.</p> <p><strong>for the spice paste:<br> 5 small, hot chillies (bird's eye)<br> 5 spring onions<br> 4 cloves of garlic<br> a lump of ginger about the size of a golf ball<br> 6 lime leaves<br> 1 tbsp coriander seed<br> 1 tsp cumin seed<br> 2 green cardamom pods<br> 1 tbsp groundnut oil<br> a small handful of coriander</strong></p> <p><strong>for the curry:<br> 2 large aubergines<br> 6 medium-sized tomatoes<br> a can of coconut milk<br> more fresh coriander<br> to serve: steamed white rice for four</strong></p> <p>Make the curry paste: cut the chillies in half, scrape out the seeds and discard them, then put the chillies into the bowl of a food processor. Roughly chop the spring onions, discarding the darkest of the green shoots as you go, then add them to the chillies together with the peeled cloves of garlic. </p> <p>Peel the ginger and cut it into thin slices. Remove the thick central vein from the lime leaves, roll the leaves up tightly, then shred them finely. Add them with the ginger, coriander and cumin to the food processor. Crack the cardamom pods open and smash the seeds to a powder in a pestle and mortar, then add it to the chilli mixture with the oil. Blitz till you have a rough paste, pushing the mixture down from the sides of the bowl as you go. Add a good handful of coriander leaves and stems. You can add 8 or 10 roots, too, clean and scrubbed. Blitz again.</p> <p>For the curry, slice the aubergines in half, then cut each half into thick wedges. Cut each wedge in half. Grill the aubergines, without any oil, over a hot grill or on a ridged griddle pan until they are tender and marked black by the bars of the grill. Remove each one as it becomes ready. Chop the tomatoes. </p> <p>Warm 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan or wok, then add the spice paste. Let it sizzle, stirring to prevent it colouring or sticking, then add the tomatoes and let them soften. You want them to be really squishy and collapsed. Stir in the grilled aubergine then the coconut milk. Simmer for 12-15 minutes, until tender. </p> <p>Roughly chop a good couple of handfuls of coriander leaves and stir them in. Serve with rice. </p> <p><strong>A simple fig tart</strong></p> <p>Fruit, pastry and a bit of fruit jelly. What could be simpler? A little cream, served in a jug, would be in order here. Serve the tart warm, not cold. Serves 4-6.</p> <p><strong>a 400g block of puff pastry<br> 8-10 figs, depending on their size<br> 200g apple or redcurrant jelly</strong><br></p> <p>Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Roll the pastry into a long thin rectangle, roughly 22 x 30cm. It should be really quite thin. Trim the edges neatly and lift it onto a non-stick baking sheet. </p> <p>Cut each fig into 4 or 5 flat slices. Lay these over the pastry, each one slightly overlapping the next, leaving a small rim around the edge of the pastry. </p> <p>Bake until the pastry is golden and risen (15-20 minutes). Melt the jelly in a small saucepan. Remove the tart from the oven, then spoon the jelly over. Return it to the oven for a few minutes, then remove and leave to cool a bit before serving.

  "<p>The call came in from somewhere out on the rain-slicked New Jersey Turnpike. Could they please hold the curtain at tonight's benefit performance of The Owl and the Pussycat at Manhattan's City Center? Pleasepleasepleasepleasepleeeeease?</p> <p>Kimora Lee Simmons, the dynamo director of Baby Phat fashions, was in the back seat of her extra-long platinum Bentley, running half an hour late. Did it mean anything to anyone that she was the chairwoman, yes, the chairwoman of the event? 'There are rules for these things. The show will start on time,' somebody had to tell her. Ralph and Ricky Lauren were in the house. So were Diane von Furstenberg, Oscar de la Renta, and Zac Posen, the 23-year-old who had crafted Kimora's gown, with the loopy swish that looked like a conch. </p> <p>Kimora's husband, Russell Simmons, arrived at the theatre in his white Ford Excursion. The affable co-founder of Def Jam Records, Russell, who had recently sold his Phat Fashions clothing company for $140m, joined the ladies with fur wraps inside as they awaited US Vogue editor-at-large Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley's turn onstage with the Martha Graham dance troupe. As the performance got under way, Kimora sneaked in through a side entrance and she and Russell sat down, holding hands.</p> <p>After the show, there was a dinner dance at the Plaza, where Russell and Kimora were seated with Anna Wintour. But Kimora was distracted. There was something for sale in the silent auction outside, and she wanted to go home with it. 'Unprecedented fantasy opportunity to have Mr Blahnik name a shoe in your honor', the sign said.</p> <p>Kimora slipped out to the vestibule to keep an eye on the prize. 'Did no one hear me on the microphone? I said, \"No one go mess with the Manolo Blahniks! I'm the chairwoman!\"' she joked. Kimora got on a mobile phone with a Minneapolis doctor whose wife was there fishing for a birthday present. 'You're making me look bad,' Kimora said to him in her jingling, cash-money voice. 'Tell your wife I will give you a pair of mine. Let's just collaborate.' The doctor caved in, and somebody chided Kimora for her furtive price-fixing. But there was other competition. Kimora found herself toe-to-toe with Suzanne Levine, a podiatrist celebrated for tending to the ailments of the high-high-heeled. 'I don't know why Manolo Blahnik would want to name a shoe after a podiatrist, but whatever,' someone in the crowd whispered. 'It's my livelihood,' Levine kept saying.</p> <p>Kimora Lee was a more obvious Cinderella for the slipper. Born out of wedlock, this woman-child from the Midwest had willed herself on to the runways of Europe as a model and was now the high-living other half of the city's most fascinating power couple. </p> <p>A man shouted that he was the lawyer for Dr Suzanne Levine, so nobody should try anything funny. 'I want you to make sure no one does this to me, Jack,' said Kimora to her lawyer and manager, Jack McCue. But the hands on her diamond-flecked watch touched 12, and Russell dragged Kimora back to her car. The shoe was hers, or so she thought. But then Levine bid a final $20,000 on a piece of folded paper, and after a protracted cellular exchange with McCue from the car, Kimora decided she had enough Manolos at home to play with.</p> <p>The gossip columnists sunk their canines into the incident. The scarlet Kabbala string on Kimora's wrist, the one 'blessed by the matriarch Rachel - she's long dead, like in a tomb somewhere', had again failed to protect her.</p> <p>'You gotta get tough,' Russell told his wife. She had gone to such trouble - for him! - to measure up as an urban fashion icon, a woman who, in her own words, could 'inspire young women to aspire'. But to the New York tabloids, Kimora is an irresistible pin cushion.</p> <p>'Why is everyone worrying about what she spends?' says Russell. 'They should be worried about what Roberto Cavalli spends, too. How many cars does Tommy Hilfiger have, by the way?'</p> <p>'If you are successful, people want to see it,' says Vogue's Talley. 'They want to share in the dream.' Especially people of struggle, as Russell Simmons tactfully calls them. It's one reason rap lyrics sometimes read like shopping lists.</p> <p>However, the auction-room spat has been surpassed on the Kimora scandal meter. In July she was pulled over while driving her Mercedes for 'for minor vehicle violations' and charged with eluding police, careless driving and possession of marijuana under 50g. All of which she denied at an August court appearance. </p> <p>'There was not a bag of drugs in the car,' says her lawyer, Stacey Richman. 'Evidently some item that has some marijuana residue in it was in the car. I don't believe the item belonged to her.' Husband Russell sees the episode as a commercial opportunity. 'Have you seen the mug shot?' he asked. 'It's a nice T-shirt at the end of the day.'</p> <p>In the mugshot Kimora is wearing her Kabala wrist string. Yet again it failed to bring her luck.</p> <p>Long ago, Kimora Lee realised that if she couldn't be the most popular girl in school, it might be fun to be the girl everybody talks about. 'Be happy if people are talking about you,' her father used to say. Only now she's not so sure. The self-styled World's Biggest Collector of Louis Vuitton is trying not to brag these days, but there's just so much to show off. 'I am a fly bitch!' the 29-year-old says, sounding slightly exasperated.</p> <p>'I have this vision of Kimora being the greatest brand in the world,' says Russell, 46. 'There's no woman better. Nobody should put on a Franck Muller diamond-platinum watch before Kimora. You have some girl who's a rapper who came from the block? It ain't the same as Kimora.'</p> <p>Russell started Baby Phat in 1999, the year after he married Kimora, recognising his bride's potential as a champion of the multi-ethnic woman, an image that could sell a new line of women's and children's clothing to teenagers and clued-in young mums. Under the ex-model's supervision, Baby Phat fashion shows were like rock concerts, promoting the entire Phat family. Runway collections were created in three weeks: editors chuckled at the visible safety pins and the fur stoles camouflaging hurried finishing on spring 2004's Josephine Baker showgirls, but none of that stuff was ever meant for upscale department stores. The big business is in the jeans, the T-shirts, the copycat Vuitton-like bags, graffitied with the BP logo.</p> <p>The Times Square billboard will be one of the first sightings of Kimora Lee: The Brand. The newly formed Simmons Jewelry Company is inventing a Kimora-cut diamond. Talks are intensifying to get Kimora her own Baby Phat Barbie, a line of MAC cosmetics, a Coty perfume.</p> <p>The fashion company is but one sliver of Kimora's portfolio. Hollywood has been on line one ever since she was a judge on Tyra Banks's hit TV show America's Next Top Model. And a talk show, Life &amp; Style, is arriving at the same time this autumn as her role as a basketball player's ex in Beauty Shop, MGM's Barbershop spin-off.</p> <p>'I loved the whole experience, and I want to do more of it!' says Kimora. 'Damn! She's basketball tall,' the film crew marvelled whenever she stepped out of her trailer, 6ft 4in in heels, her three dogs yap-yap-yapping, a huge birthday bouquet from her husband outside with the remains of an ice sculpture of her bitch-goddess self. Russell flew a poet in to recite some birthday verse: '27 Again', the title teased.</p> <p>Russell was ambivalent about her doing the movie. He doesn't know if he wants everyone in the world to know just how crazy and funny and silly Kimora can be. 'There's a lot of stuff Russell wishes I wouldn't do,' Kimora acknowledges.</p> <p>At parties, if Russell is working the room, Kimora gets restless. 'Whenever you're ready,' she says loudly. Russell cocktail-parties with Mayor Bloomberg, Martha Stewart, Ron Perelman. Sounding at times like a man planning a run for office, he's been vocal about public education, drug-law reform and voter registration, and he gives almost $1m a year to charity. </p> <p>Russell and Kimora have a unique relationship in hip-hop culture, says Talley: 'She's not behind him, she's on the side of him, and sometimes she's in front of him.' But even though Kimora scored $20m of her own from the Phat fashion sale, it's Russell who is sitting in the director's chair, Russell who just took her to England to meet Prince Charles.</p> <p>'There's a difference between a rapper talking about a luxury brand and someone who really has the ability to establish one,' says Russell. 'I want people to know Kimora's history.'</p> <p>It's a history that could have been written by Danielle Steel. Ten minutes after her warm hello, Kimora casually drops that she had an exclusive contract modelling for Chanel at the age of 13. Russell likes to say she lived with Karl Lagerfeld.</p> <p>Already, one detects the myth-making. In 1989, shortly after the 14th candle was snuffed out on Kimora Perkins's cake, a scout in St Louis put her on a plane to Paris. Lagerfeld had just broken up with his muse of six years, Ines de la Fressange. In strode Kimora, late of Dillard's department store in the Galleria shopping mall. Lagerfeld repackaged her as a bejewelled child bride with a big-bowed hat for Chanel's haute-couture grand finale.</p> <p>'This girl represents the Nineties!' he told reporters. 'She has human proportions!' When CNN's fashion correspondent asked where she was from, Lagerfeld professed ignorance. W magazine guessed she was Hawaiian.</p> <p>'We always felt that Karl had kind of used Kimora to flaunt in Ines's face,' says Kimora's St Louis agent, Delcia Corlew. 'You know, a sort of, \"Here's this young girl who's taking your place.\"'</p> <p>'I was 13! I was certainly the youngest face. I was certainly the most different face that had ever been the bride or the muse,' says Kimora. In her adolescent mind, she believed that Lagerfeld, a confirmed bachelor, wanted to marry Ines. But Lagerfeld was dallying with others, too: Bernadette Jurkowski, Shoshanna Fitzgerald and Olga Sobolewska. Women's Wear Daily labelled all four 'the Karlettes'. 'Olga was the only one on contract, and Olga's name wasn't really even Olga,' Shoshanna remembers. 'Karl just didn't like her real name.'</p> <p>Kimora was speedily indoctrinated in the ways of fantasy. But making friends was difficult because there were no other children skipping around 31 rue Cambon. She was soon pirouetting through the local McDonald's in Chanel's signature silk ballerina shoes, cardigan and 'camellia bows out of the yin-yang,' she says. Staff at the fashion house joked that Kimora had become 'Mademoiselle Chanel'.</p> <p>'She wanted a Porsche, she wanted a Mercedes, I knew that about her,' says Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, who was introduced to her at the time.</p> <p>Lagerfeld himself was proficient in the art of high maintenance, says Kimora: 'I remember his house on rue de l'Universit\u00e9. It was like, hoist the piano through the window. Hoist the 10-ton marble sculpture up the six flights of stairs.'</p> <p>But Kimora only worked two seasons for Chanel, says her second agent, Bethann Hardison. 'It was a novelty for Karl, a moment,' says Hardison flatly. 'She talks about it a lot because it's chic to talk about.' Kimora adds: 'You know how Russell will say, \"My wife has travelled all over the world and she speaks these different languages and she taught me what fork to pick up?\" Well, Karl taught me which fork to pick up. Andtospeakveryquickly.'</p> <p>Whereas other models could be frosty, Kimora radiated a sunny familiarity as she was fussed over at fittings. But Kimora was always in the fridge or running up a scandalous phone bill, and Lagerfeld's patience was not elastic. 'She got on people's nerves,' says Hardison. 'The child was ostentatious.'</p> <p>'It's a wonderful thing I've created with you,' Lagerfeld told her, 'but now you're a $5,000-tote-bag-wearing monster, and for that, I am sorry.' Kimora requested Tyra Banks as her roommate in one model apartment. 'She always had the new Prada bag and would laugh at me because mine was from Wal-Mart,' says Banks.</p> <p>Careering back and forth between Paris and St Louis, Kimora graduated on time with the help of a coach. Her mother was thinking college and tried to stop Kimora from frittering away her tiny fortune. But at the age of 15, she'd bought herself a Rolex and a second-hand BMW convertible, before she even had a driver's licence. Accidents ensued. Some girls spray-painted the car. Other Dillard's models hissed about the Pomeranian now poking out of Kimora's Louis Vuitton holdall. </p> <p>Kimora Lee's father, she says, was the first black deputy federal marshal in St Louis. The rest of the story is generally redacted. He was out of the picture before his daughter was born. Like his daughter, Vernon Whitlock Jr distinguished himself early: graduating at the top of his police academy class in St Louis, he was recruited by the federal marshals in 1962. He told people he marched with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. After 10 years, Whitlock quit to be an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigator; the money was better, and it got even better when he became a bail bondsman in the late Seventies. But he was such a superfly, with his flashy cars and clothes and diamond-chip rings, and such a braggart - trading bonds for jewellery or sex with inmates' girlfriends, court papers alleged, and dealing cocaine and synthetic heroin - that in 1985, he was targeted by several law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>Sentenced to 24 years when Kimora was in primary school, Whitlock was sprung after just three: he swaggered into the local marshal's office and told ex-colleagues he'd turned state's evidence against his supplier. Now a barber, Whitlock was a guest at Kimora's St Barts wedding and captured the ceremony on video, which he screens for customers at his shop.</p> <p>Her mother's story is very Joy Luck Club, Kimora says. Joanne Perkins was born into the chaos of the Korean War and later adopted by an American serviceman who had spotted her mother filling sandbags in Inchon. Joanne maintains that her 'full-blooded Japanese' mother went to Korea from Kyoto as a refugee during the Second World War, though this would make her a historical anomaly. There were few, if any, refugees from Kyoto, since it was never bombed, and those who left for Korea at the war's end were invariably ethnic Koreans who were being repatriated.</p> <p>Joanne Perkins worked as an administrator for Social Security and has retired to a house in East Hampton that Kimora bought for her. Perkins now calls herself by her mother's name, Kyoko, baffling longtime acquaintances. For Kimora, the link to her Japanese heritage represents another marketing opportunity. 'I cannot wait to get Kimora on a plane and take her to Japan,' says Russell, 'because I know they're going to go crazy.' 'I consider myself to be one of the black women in fashion who made it,' she says. 'But black women don't look at me like that.'</p> <p>'A number of them probably think Russell should be married to a black woman,' says Emil Wilbekin, editorial director of Vibe magazine. And in negotiations for TV shows and movies, race remains an issue: is Kimora Lee Simmons black enough?</p> <p>Kimora was 17 when Russell Simmons, who grew up in Queens, spotted her on the catwalk. Russell's girlfriends looked like they'd stepped out of a cigarette ad - 'But with Def Jam's success, he got a crack at a different grade of model,' says a hip-hop executive who's known him for years. 'In Russell's mind, he's always trading up.' Russell sent ridiculous flowers to Kimora's agency, so heavy that two men were required to move them. 'I thought that was major,' Kimora remembers. 'I told Tyra.' Banks replied: 'I can imagine what they look like, because he sent me some, too.' Tyra told Kimora to get rid of him.</p> <p>Kimora's bookings would soon fall off - people complained she was a brat - but Russell's interest did not flag. 'I was kind of more on his level,' says Kimora. They were on and off for years. 'He was a playboy, and I am a bit crazy because of it today,' says Kimora. She eventually fled to Milan to escape the insanity. After a year, Russell begged Kimora's mother for her phone number. Yoga and veganism had chased away the partying and the other women. Kimora moved into Russell's house in Beverly Hills and took courses at UCLA. According to friends, Russell is happier and more stable since Kimora arrived in his life for good. 'Kimora's very flamboyant and Russell tries not to be,' says Donald Trump, 'but in many respects, they're the same.'</p> <p>Russell is quick to point out his Timex to a reporter, but he is a yogi with Brahmin tastes. Russell often quotes his rapper brother, the Reverend Run - 'You can't help the poor if you're one of them.' </p> <p>Kimora shuffles downstairs wearing her FUCK FAME T-shirt, rocks flashing like high beams on both hands. With 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, the house in Saddle River, New Jersey, is way bigger than the one in East Hampton. 'It's actually two or three houses deep,' says Kimora. 'You're like Alice in Wonderland in here - and I'm not saying this in a bragging way.' </p> <p>Such a great big space required lots of filling. First, there's Russell's art, a rare Dalai Lama face mask, some Bleckners, a Clemente here, a Warhol/Basquiat collaboration there. And Kimora's innumerable objets: Faberg\u00e9 eggs ('All from Czar whomever - Nicholas! I mean, what he gave to his czarina, right? They're probably not original - see! Faberg\u00e9 eggs! I love my eggs'), Limoges boxes ('That's the little tag that I want to rip off, but my mother would tell me not to').</p> <p>After Gianni Versace died, Kimora practically showed up at Sotheby's with a removal van. 'This is actually Versace's china. His very own that he ate off,' she said with liturgical solemnity. 'This is His own personal bed from His personal bedroom. His mattress. You go figure it out.'</p> <p>Versace was one of the few designers who could actually create a supermodel, but he didn't think Kimora was sexy. 'Kimora's such a baby!' he used to say, which made her glum because she preferred his extravagant stylings. Now Kimora's older daughter, Ming, four, is jumping up and down on His satin-duchesse bedspread, on His $20,000 mahogany lit d'alcove.</p> <p>'No respect for the Versace bed,' Kimora says calmly. 'There is nothing in here that a kid can't touch.' When she was growing up, her white stepmother had a white sofa. And she would say: 'You're gonna get it if you don't get out of my living room.' There are no white sofas here. Or white pets. 'Who's even this colour in this house?' she shouted to her assistant, spotting some fuzz on a tufted ottoman. 'All my animals are black!'</p> <p>Kimora collects dogs with names like Beluga. Miyake is a cat that showed up on her doorstep, 'so calm and sweet, like the people in Saddle River,' she said. 'But I have another one, Midnight, from the ghettos of Seattle. He's long and wiry and crazy. He'll knock stuff over,' she said admiringly.</p> <p>In a recent magazine campaign, Kimora was photographed in her mansion as a you-can't-touch-this chatelaine attended by an array of servants. It got people's attention. 'The message is: I'm rich and you're not,' says Robin Givhan, The Washington Post's fashion critic. 'I found the ads offensive. It's a very calculated \"look at all the stuff I have\", with the domestics, and the kids are just another possession.'</p> <p>But plenty of designers have starred in their own ads, including Calvin, Giorgio, Donna, Donatella and Ralph. 'It makes people feel like they're more a part of your life,' said Kimora. 'And my life is so crazy and so over-the-top, a True Hollywood Story, except without being tragic.'</p> <p>Daughter Aoki doesn't want to take a bath, and Kimora swings the 18-month-old up on her hip. 'Really, it's hard being a teenage mother. That's why they say you should wait until you're old enough, and maybe I wasn't old enough for you two,' Kimora says playfully. 'When they get older, I may get a tutor on the road.' She won't separate from her children, she says, and if she's gone for any length of time, the animals hop on the Gulfstream, too.</p> <p>Aoki's tears turned into long sighs. Kimora is friendly with half-Japanese model Devon Aoki, who landed enviable contracts with Chanel and Versace. Kimora not only hired her for a Baby Phat ad campaign, she also snatched her manager. 'But I didn't name my daughter after her,' Kimora said, 'though maybe subliminally, subconsciously it happened.' Kimora headed into her favourite room, a walk-in closet with CCTV cameras ogling shoes like jewel-encrusted barges. A man appears, Kimora's queer eye, she says. 'These are Giuseppe Zanotti,' he says, grabbing a pair of pumps, 'and she had these before Beyonc\u00e9 did in her video.' Kimora considers the fistfuls of jewellery locked up in the safe, and how she was always buying these gifts for herself. Russell just wasn't that kind of guy, she says. She looks sad.</p> <p>An SUV grumbles to a halt outside, and Russell Simmons climbs out. 'Hi, hubby!' He's fasting, penance for paella eaten on holiday with the guys. He goes to grab several baby bottles filled with scary-looking green stuff out of the fridge. She can't imagine how anyone can drink that stuff, even if it is in a Tiffany glass.</p> <p>The S on the Neverlandish gates outside stands for samadhi, a state of blissful union. 'The whole thing about living in a house like this,' says Kimora, 'is being able to share it with your family. Have tonnes of kids! Have tonnes of animals!' A giant topiary giraffe at the end of her driveway is the last thing Kimora sees when she heads out into the world. And it will never disappear from her rear-view mirror.</p>",

The burned-out, alcoholic Creasy (Denzel Washington) goes there to act as bodyguard to Pita (Dakota Fanning), the 10-year-old daughter of a rich Mexican businessman and his blonde American wife (Radha Mitchell). He's a former assassin for the US government's counter-insurgency division and in search of redemption. </p> <p>'Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?' he asks his old CIA chum, Christopher Walken. After reluctantly bonding with his young charge, Creasy is nearly killed when she's kidnapped and drags himself from his bed to go on a rampage, torturing and killing anyone associated with the abduction. </p> <p>Adapted by Brian Helgeland from a 1980 novel set in Italy, the movie has been switched to Mexico City because it's now the world capital of kidnapping for profit (though Baghdad probably holds the title pro tem ) and the place is presented as a polluted hell, rotten to the core. </p> <p>Only an honest middle-aged cop and a crusading journalist stand up to the universal corruption and they unite in helping to unleash Creasy. It's an exciting tale, roughly an hour too long, and marred as always by Scott's self-conscious artiness, a legacy of days shooting commercials. There's slow motion, fast motion, hectic editing, pounding music and even the sub-titles are designed to jump up and hit you between the eyes. Denzel Washington is his commanding, jaw-clenching self and Dakota Fanning (whose name sounds to me like a Midwest company manufacturing air-conditioners) shows once again that she's the most accomplished child actor at work today. </p> <p>The film I most enjoyed last week, <strong> Bright Leaves</strong>, is a rambling highly personal essay in which Ross McElwee, the Boston-based documentarist, returns to his native North Carolina to meet friends and relatives and look into the state's tobacco industry in which his great-grandfather played a major role in the years after the Civil War. </p> <p>Apparently the nineteenth-century McElwee developed the weed known as Bull Durham and started manufacturing cigarettes by machine but was destroyed by his rival, the autocratic bully James Buchanan Duke, who went on to become one of the world's richest men. If great-grandad had won out, McElwee's family would be rolling in money today, but they'd be steeped in guilt for killing more people through lung cancer and heart disease than died in the Civil War. He also pursues a curious id\u00e9e fixe that the long-forgotten 1951 Warner Brothers melodrama Bright Leaf , starring Gary Cooper and Patri cia Neal, was a fictionalised version of his great-grandfather's life. McElwee is a more congenial companion than Michael Moore and his movie gives self-indulgence a good name. It deserves a wider showing than it's getting. </p> <p>Also about the hypnotic quality of cinema, and one of today's five movies about ghosts and revenants, Tsai Ming-Liang's elegant <strong> Goodbye Dragon Inn</strong> is set on the last night of a large, decaying cinema in, presumably, Taipei. The two-person staff - a male projectionist and a female cashier with a gammy leg - wander round the building but never meet. The film being shown is King Hu's 1966 martial arts classic Dragon Inn and the audience gradually disappears until a mere handful remain, some clearly ghosts. Shot in deep focus with long takes and little camera movement, the movie has only four lines of dialogue. One is 'Do you know this theatre is haunted?'; another is 'Nobody goes to the cinema any more'. You'll love it or hate it. I loved it. </p> <p>The second ghost movie is the latest bizarre South Korean horror flick, <strong> Into the Mirror</strong>, in which a series of strange murders occur in the days leading up to the re-opening of a grand department store in Seoul. A young homicide detective suspects that a serial killer is on the rampage; a former senior colleague of his, now working as the shop's head of security, believes that a vengeful ghost, operating through the endless mirrors, is a possible culprit. It's a very clever film about mirrors and mirror images that Lewis Carroll and Jean Cocteau would have loved. Among the clues is a National Gallery postcard of Jan van Eyck's The Arnolfini Marriage, with its mysterious convex mirror. </p> <p>Jacques Rivette, 76, the least known and most cultish of the Nouvelle Vague directors, is noted for the length, obscurity and infrequency of his pictures, though his latest, <strong> Histoire de Marie et Julien</strong>, was made only two years after his previous one, lasts a mere 150 minutes and tells a seemingly straightforward love story. As with Tony Scott and Man on Fire, this picture has been on Rivette's mind for 27 years and he originally intended Albert Finney and Leslie Caron to play the Parisian clockmaker and the enigmatic beauty who enters his life. The roles are now taken by Jerzy Radziwilowicz and Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, the heroine of Rivette's last really good movie, La Belle Noiseuse. The film has echoes of Hitchcock's Vertigo and Cocteau's Orph\u00e9e and turns on the commonplace notion that the dead remain with us until their work on earth has been discharged. For a picture about the fantastic and supernatural, it's a surprisingly flat and unmagical affair. </p> <p>The ghost in<strong> Bubba Ho-tep</strong> is a malevolent Egyptian mummy conjured up from somewhere to wreak havoc in a dismal convalescent home in Mud Creek, Texas, where he's challenged by an elderly black patient who believes himself to be Jack Kennedy and a wrinkled old man with a Zimmer frame who is either an Elvis Presley impersonator or the King himself. Depending on how that description strikes you, it's neither as good nor bad as it sounds. </p> <p>In the terrible <strong> Resident Evil: Apocalypse</strong>, based on a best-selling video game, the ghosts are undead cannibals, released from the underground laboratories of a crazy biotech corporation to lay waste a place called Raccoon City. It's morgue-standard 'Dawn of the Dead' stuff, as unnecessary a sequel as ever got made. </p> <p>Finally, two movies about love by women writer-directors. Set in smart bohemian-academic-professional Dublin, Liz Gill's <strong> Goldfish Memory</strong> takes its title from the chat-up line a womanising university lecturer uses on his girl pupils. He compares the three-second memory of a goldfish to the transience of love. It's a thin, likable Irish variation on La Ronde , though less an amorous roundabout than a M\u00f6bius strip for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and straights, who are favoured by the director in that descending order. </p> <p>Clare Peploe's <strong> The Triumph of Love</strong>, more formally philosophical on matters of mind and heart, is an adaptation of an early 18th-century Marivaux commedia dell'arte comedy. A princess (Mira Sorvino) and her servant dress in men's clothes to stir up a detached philosopher (Ben Kingsley) and his spinster sister (Fiona Shaw) as a means of winning over the thinker's handsome ward. The cross-dressed Sorvino is lovely, but the play doesn't work on screen. It's a little like Twelfth Night , but more like a month of Sundays.</p>",
  "Denial is a useful psychological description of the mental state of a patient who can't acknowledge the blindingly obvious. If a representative sample of politicians and political journalists were sectioned under the Mental Health Act, any half-way decent psychologist would conclude that an epidemic of denial had swept Westminster like chicken pox through a kindergarten. <p>The conventional wisdom holds that Tony Blair is the master of his destiny. If he wants to stay Prime Minister for another five years, a third term with a comfortable majority is his for the taking. The Tories are still the busted flush they have been for the past decade. The Liberal Democrats may be more popular, but remain as irrelevant as ever to the great game of winning and holding power. </p> <p>To agree with the established view you have to deny four facts which strike outsiders as self-evident. </p> <p><b> 1. The anti-Tory coalition is falling apart</b><br> </p> <p>From the early 1990s to the Iraq war, centre-left voters wised-up and used the first-past-the-post system to crucify the Tories for what they had done to Britain. John Major is remembered for sneaking a freak victory in the 1992 general election. But Major's Conservatives won 41.9 per cent of the vote, marginally down on the 42.2 per cent Margaret Thatcher secured in 1987 and 1.2 per cent up on the 40.7 per cent who voted for Tony Blair in 2001. His success didn't help him. While Thatcher had a majority of 102 seats in 1987 and Blair had a majority of 167 in 2001, poor old Major's lead was a miserly 21. </p> <p>Labour had done far better in the marginal seats where elections are decided because the electorate was voting tactically. By 1997, the power of tactical voting was there for all to see. Liberals voted Labour and Labour supporters voted Liberal and the once-mighty Parliamentary Conservative Party was reduced to a rump of pasty-faced has-beens. </p> <p>The world of the 1990s is gone. As I mentioned a few weeks ago, it's still easy to imagine Labour supporters voting Lib Dem to keep the Tories out but hard to see how most opponents of the war can vote for Tony Blair. The demise of tactical voting will reinvigorate the Tories as certainly as its rise destroyed them. In St Albans and Welwyn and many tight seats like them, the Tories don't need to increase their vote to win. They just need Lib Dems, Greens and the rest to stop voting Labour. </p> <p>Westminster wisdom holds that there are scarcely any Labour/Lib Dem marginals. But again the standard line feels all wrong. If the Lib Dems are taking safe Labour seats in by-elections, why should it be different at the general election? Put it this way, if you woke up the morning after to hear that the Lib Dems had replaced 20 Labour MPs in constituencies with large student, liberal middle-class and Muslim populations, would it be such a shock? </p> <p>Peter Hain is alone among Labour leaders in realising that his party could be caught in a pincer movement. His colleagues and most of the media don't grasp the possibility because their extrapolations from poll findings are based on a set of voting assumptions which predict that the pattern of tactical anti-Tory voting of 2001 won't break down in 2005. (They are known as the 'Baxter assumptions' if you want to impress your friends.) </p> <p>Mike Smithson of politicalbetting. com showed me what happens if you assume the Baxter assumptions are wrong. The last Observer poll put the Tories on 33 per cent, Labour on 32 per cent and the Lib Dems on 25. The conventional measures used to translate votes into seats gave Labour 322 seats, the Tories 227 and the Lid Dems 52. Change the assumptions to take account of Iraq, however, and you get Labour on 296, the Tories on 269 and the Lib Dems on 52 - or a hung Parliament and Blair unable to carry on as PM as the Lib Dems won't work with him. </p> <p>You can fiddle with the assumptions for ever, and Smithson's a gambler not a prophet. None the less his advice is: if you're offered good odds on a hung Parliament, take the bet. </p> <p>Government supporters protest that Labour will recover. The economy's doing well, public services are improv ing, crime and unemployment rates have fallen off a cliff and the Tories are ugly, boring and stupid. </p> <p>As soon as they open their mouths, they show they are in denial about our second self-evident truth. </p> <p><b> 2. The Tories aren't as ugly, boring and stupid as they look</b><br> </p> <p>Everyone says that they require a gigantic swing of 11 points to win. Maybe. But to stop Labour getting an overall majority, they need only increase their vote by a couple of points. </p> <p>There's every reason to think that they will. Before the 1997 and 2001 elections, Tories stumbled around in a state of weary despair. Now they are furious about foxhunting, asylum seekers, crime and Europe. They hate Blair with a passion that those of us who see the Prime Minister's Thatcherite tendencies find quite mad. In an age of small turnouts, angry minorities have a disproportionate impact. To quote the most obvious example, hardly anyone will vote Labour because it wants to ban foxhunting with dogs. But foxhunters will vote and campaign for the Tories. </p> <p>For reasons no one can adequately explain, the opinion polls have underestimated Tory support for years. Notoriously in 1992 they failed to predict Major's victory. What isn't as well known is that in 1997 the average opinion poll result for the Tories over the campaign was 3.5 per cent below their actual vote. In 2001 the polls underestimated their real support by 6.5 per cent. The rise of Ukip and by-elections notwithstanding, it's always worth assuming that the Tories are doing better than the media say. </p> <p><b> 3. Labour's friends won't rally round</b><br> </p> <p>Martin Amis's 1995 novel, The Information, caught the political attitude of intellectual London at the zenith of the anti-Tory coalition. Richard, the wretched hero, is gazing with envy at the new mansion of his friend Gwyn, a vapid novelist who has become rich by peddling witless morality tales. </p> <p>'Of course, thought Richard. Yeah: of course Gwyn was Labour. It was obvious. Obvious not only from the ripply cornice 20 feet above their heads, not from the brass lamps or the military plumpness of the leather-topped desk. Obvious because Gwyn was what he was, a writer in England, at the end of the twentieth century. There was nothing else for such a person to be. Richard was Labour, equally obviously. It often seemed to him, moving in the circles he moved in and reading what he read, that everyone in England was Labour, except the government.' </p> <p>Not any more. The herd of independent minds has mooed and moved on. Apart from the hired help of the Murdoch press, Tony Blair has precious little intellectual support. It's no good saying to his critics that the liberal-left has turned its back on the victims of fascism for the first time in its history. </p> <p>Or that Iraqi democrats deserved and deserve support. Or that Saddam killed millions and the UN sanctions and bombing campaigns of that nice Robin Cook killed hundreds of thousands. Or that David Kelly thought that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Or that Andrew Gilligan broke the first rule of journalism and stitched up his source, who then killed himself. </p> <p>None of these arguments works. (Trust me, I've tried.) </p> <p>Internationalism either died with the socialist movement in the twentieth century or is hibernating while Bush is in the White House. The detail of what happened in the days before Kelly's death is neither here nor there. </p> <p>The dispute between Blair and the intellectual liberal-left isn't really about whether Iraq should have remained a tyranny. It's about the Atlantic alliance, Britain's national interest, honest government and the monumental mistake of claiming that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction when he didn't. </p> <p>If my reading is right, then not even successful elections in Iraq will make a difference. Blair will go into 2005 with as little heavyweight support as Michael Foot in 1983. It doesn't mean he will lose, in fact it would be perversely marvellous if he won, but taking that risk means you have to believe that there is no alternative and deny the obvious that </p> <p><b> 4. Yes there is</b><br> </p> <p>Gordon Brown. A YouGov poll for the Mail on Sunday found that if Brown was Labour leader its ratings would shoot out of the hung-Parliament zone and back into landslide territory. </p> <p>The failure of the Cabinet to tell Blair it was time to make way for Brown in the summer may yet prove one of the most disastrous mistakes in the history of the Labour movement. Perhaps if enough Labour MPs realise that their careers could be finished, it will be rectified.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, 24 members of the Irish Ramblers Club travelled to South America. Our plan was to cross from Peru to Bolivia but, due to unrest in Bolivia, the border was closed. </p> <p>We had booked flights from La Paz to Lima worth \u00a33,288 and had to cancel them. The Bolivian airline in Cusco said we would get a refund, but had to go through our travel agent, Condor Travel in London, which agreed to process it.</p> <p>Over the next six months, I emailed and phoned on numerous occasions and made three personal visits without avail. Finally I contacted the airline in Barcelona and its head office in La Paz. On 6 July, the airline confirmed that it had sent the cheque to Condor Travel but, two months later, I still have not received the money.<br><strong>FR, Dublin</strong> </p> <p>Condor Travel said it had a cheque - for \u00a32,013 - for you but was waiting for you to confirm how you wanted to receive it - by cheque or direct payment - and that you would accept \u00a32,013 in full and final settlement. The lower amount appears to be due to several currency conversions. You had already provided this information and agreed to accept the lower amount to end the saga. Your cheque has now arrived. </p> <p><strong> So near and yet so Faro</strong> </p> <p> I left my handbag in the hotel when rushing to catch a flight home from Faro airport. We heard that the bag had been handed in by hotel staff but Airtours would not post it to me because it contained valuables, such as my driving licence. My Norwich Union travel insurance will not pay to send it back by courier because the handbag is not lost.<br><strong>KL, Halesworth</strong> </p> <p>Airtours says it has no confirmation your handbag has been found and it does not generally return lost property to Britain. But, if you paid it a \u00a335 search fee and it found the bag, the company would send it back by courier, although you have to pay and the courier it uses will not ship valuables. </p> <p>Norwich Union would pay compensation only if the bag really is lost, and then minus an excess. You cannot claim for the cost of posting it back and, if you believe the bag is safe, cannot say it is lost. Your cheapest option is to pay the hotel to send it with a courier that accepts valuables. </p> <p><strong> Accounting for Abbey's bad habit </strong> </p> <p> I opened an Abbey Isa and wanted to transfer \u00a31,400 from an existing Isa with Principality building society. Abbey's customer helpline said the money was transferred on 29 June. I tried to withdraw \u00a31,200 on 23 July and was told that there were no funds in my account. </p> <p>On 29 July, Abbey said it did have my money but it had not yet been posted to my account. I needed the \u00a31,200 to make a mortgage payment and, because it failed to come through, had to arrange an overdraft.<br><strong>DA, Newport</strong> </p> <p>Abbey says it has taken on more staff and brought in new equipment to clear the backlog which built up in the summer but admits you suffered bad service. It is sending you \u00a350 compensation. </p> <p><strong> Wheel of misfortune</strong> </p> <p> On 6 May, I drove over a huge piece of debris, a stripped lorry tyre, on the M65 which caused \u00a3300- worth of damage to my car. The Highways Agency turned down my claim for the repairs, saying its agents did a sweep once a week which, it assured me, fulfils its responsibility to provide a debris-free highway. But I am \u00a3300 out of pocket.<br><strong>VM, Chorley</strong> </p> <p>Under the Highways Act 1980, highway authorities must keep motorways and strategic trunk roads maintained and safe, but the law also protects them from claims for damages provided they take reasonable measures to comply. The M65 falls in inspection category B, where safety inspections must be carried out no more than once every seven days, although there are daily safety patrols as well. </p> <p>The agent, Atkins, carried out a safety inspection on 5 May and a safety patrol on the morning of 6 May and neither found any debris. It had no report of the tyre until you hit it, so the Highways Agency reckons Atkins fulfilled its obligations, so it will not pay compensation. </p> <p><strong> Can I carry on working? </strong> </p> <p> I work for an organisation that has a compulsory retirement age of 60. What will my position be in 2006, when I turn 60 in the same month that European legislation will enable me to take pension benefits and continue working?<br><strong>WH, Great Missenden</strong> </p> <p>The link between retirement and employment will be removed from 6 April 2006 and employers will not be able to impose a specific retirement age.

  "<p>If you want to know Ireland, the real Ireland, Catholic Ireland, the Ireland of the Gaels, go west. On the rocky, mountainous rim of the Atlantic the island shrugs up its boggy shoulders and thumbs its nose at Viking invaders, Cromwellian armies, the prissy Anglo influence of the Pale, and anyone else who would seek to displace a culture steeped in Celtic tradition. </p> <p>The westernmost of Ireland's peaks is cloud-capped Mount Brandon, its black hump rising from rocky fields and grey water near the end of the Dingle peninsula. At 891m, it is not the highest mountain in Ireland; that distinction - by a few feet - belongs to Carrantuohill across Dingle Bay. But Carrantuohill is jut one of a cluster of peaks; Brandon lords it alone in solitary grandeur over a thumb of land jutting into the sea. </p> <p>For centuries, Mount Brandon has been one of Ireland's \"holy mountains\", and annually on the appointed summer day pious pilgrims trek to the top. The mountain has another attractive feature for the secular hillwalker; it is close by Dingle town, one of Ireland's most charming - and welcoming - destinations. </p> <p>Some say that Mount Brandon takes its name from Bran, the mythical Celtic voyager to the Island of Women in the Western Sea; more likely, the name recalls the more firmly historical Saint Brendan. Known as the Navigator, he was born not far away near the present city of Tralee in the year 484 (or thereabouts) and was said to have sailed in a oxskin boat from a cove at the base of the mountain on a seven-year voyage in search of the Isles of the Blest. If the story were true, he would have been the first person to discover America, but there is no reliable evidence that the voyage took place at all. </p> <p>Brendan was one of many highly educated monks of the dark ages who made their home on the rugged west coast of Ireland, facing out into the rain-lashed, fog-shrouded Western Sea. Somewhere beyond those grey mists lay the Isles of the Blest, or so they believed, a place of rest and happiness. Their vision was horizontal, not vertical; their God resided not in an ethereal heaven above but in wind, sea, stone and air. </p> <p>Was it a literal paradise they sought in the apparently boundless waters of the Atlantic? Certainly in those ocean vistas they sensed the majesty of God. They built huts and oratories of unmortared stone in the westernmost reaches of Europe, and focused their attention on the sea horizon. On the summit of Mount Brandon you can still find remnants of stone structures said to be associated with Saint Brendan. </p> <p>Except for a few recent plantations of evergreens at low altitudes, the slopes and summit of the mountain are bare. Experienced hillwalkers are pretty much free to ramble wherever they please. </p> <p>The most popular route up the mount begins at the Virgin's shrine at Faha on the mountain's eastern slope, near the pretty villages of Cloghane and Brandon. Since I first took this route 30 years ago, the Kerry county council has provided a car park for half a dozen cars; on a fine summer day, many more may be jammed into the verges by the side of the road. </p> <p>A sign posted by the Kerry Mountaineering Club warns that weather conditions on the summit can be wildly different from those at the mountain's base. \"A breeze here can be a strong wind at the top,\" it says with some understatement. </p> <p>Up a short fuchsia-shaded boreen (little road), through a gate that hangs lopsidedly on its hinges, and trekkers are on their way up the hill in the footsteps of Celtic heroes and Christian saints. A first stop is often at the Marian shrine tucked into the hillside. The Virgin looks down from her central niche; while to her left is Brendan, boyishly handsome on the bow of his boat. </p> <p>The first part of the climb is something of a slog, steadily upwards through rough fields - but stop for a minute, turn around, and a dazzling prospect awaits you: the golden sands of Brandon Bay and the green hills beyond, stretching back along the peninsula towards Tralee. </p> <p>At the shoulder of the ridge, the path turns toward the ice-sculpted valley of the Owenmore river, but the adventurous hiker will keep moving straight up the mountain to Binn na Port, the Peak of the Fort, a place as remote as any on the Dingle peninsula - gloomy, cloud-wrapped, timeless. </p> <p>Here, on a jutting promontory of the mountain, two massive stone walls guard a plateau protected on other sides by steep cliffs - an iron-age fortification 822m above the sea. </p> <p>The sanctuary of Binn na Port suggests a people huddled in a cold, wet place, with minimum shelter, awaiting the onslaught of their enemies. Defeat meant slavery or death. We tend to romanticise pre-Christian Celtic culture; the archeological evidence, however, suggests a grim and violent time. </p> <p>However, it is clear that the pre-Christian Celts revered the natural world. A friend, a Celtic expert, suggests that a more correct translation of \"Binn na Port\" is \"Peak of the Music\", and indeed the wind here does play a kind of unceasing music on the rock and cliff. </p> <p>From Binn na Port, there is no way to continue our assault on the summit other than to descend again to the pilgrim path, which now enters a dark, steep-sided valley with no apparent egress from the far end. In the 19th century, John Ball, an Alpine mountaineer, visited these valleys on the flanks of Brandon and noticed similarities to valleys in Switzerland where living glaciers reside today. This is the place where the reality of the Ice Ages in northern Europe was first recognised. </p> <p>The evidence of ice is all about us as we traverse the valley: in scoured and scratched bedrock; in massive boulders carried far from their source; in ridges of rocky debris, called moraines, piled up at the former edge of the ice. Best of all, the glacier has laid open the mountain like the incision of a surgeon's knife. Great loops of layered rock in the valley's walls tell a geological story more ancient than the ice, of colliding continents, of millions of years of sedimentation, of mountains thrust upwards and eroded down. </p> <p>Now, just when you might think there is no way of going further, a track appears that zigzags almost straight up to the summit. The track is rough and steep, but at the top, if the weather is fine, you will be knocked over backwards by a view as spectacular as any you might find in Ireland - the end of the Dingle peninsula in all of its wild grandeur, with an ellipsis of islands reaching out into the sea. </p> <p>You have climbed through hundreds of millions of years of geologic history, thousands of years of myth, and hundreds of years of Irish history. You deserve a reward. So it's back down the pilgrim path for a well-earned pint at one of the friendly pubs at the mountain's base. My favourite is O'Connors in Cloghane, where you will likely find other stout-booted trekkers with whom to exchange stories of your climb. </p> <p>And then, if you are wise, you will have left enough time on your itinerary to drive the precipitous Connor Pass road to Dingle, with its many fine bars and restaurants (try Lord Baker's, The Charthouse, or The Stonehouse on the Slea Head road). The region abounds in antiquities: promontory forts, ring forts, the famous \"beehive huts\" on the slopes of Mount Eagle, medieval castles, and - unmissable - the magical Gallarus Oratory. </p> <p>This tiny chapel, shaped like an overturned boat, is perhaps the oldest intact building in these islands. It may have been built a bit after Saint Brendan's time, but the spirit of saints and scholars is all about the place, and if, on your climb up Brandon, you caught a whiff of Celtic spirituality, you will find it present here. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chet Raymo's Climbing Brandon: Science And Faith On Ireland's Holy Mountain is published in the US by Walker &amp; Company, available at <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/berteshopweb/viewproduct.do?isbn=0863223311\">The Guardian bookshop</a> for \u00a312.99 plus p&amp;p.

  "<p>A round the world, singers and sports stars are pouring their royalties into the grape. From the Napa Valley to Stellenbosch, the Loire to the Algarve, there are about a dozen personality-owned vineyards across the globe, the playthings of rich and famous oenophiles like Bob Dylan, G\u00e9rard D\u00e9pardieu and Ernie Els. </p> <p>Some celebrities prefer to keep their vineyards to themselves - Sting's Tuscan property, for instance, produces wine largely for his own personal consumption. Jurassic Park star and celebrated Kiwi winemaker Sam Neill, meanwhile, sells some excellent pinot noirs from his Two Paddocks winery just outside Queenstown on the South Island, but this, too, is off-limits to the public. However there are many VIP vineyards open to visitors. </p> <p>The highest concentration of star wine growers is in California's Napa Valley. American wine sales are worth over $21 billion, with California reaping the rewards of selling nearly two out of every three bottles produced. </p> <p>At first sniff, the Napa air is as thick with the smell of money as fresh-pressed grapes. The only other wine town in the world with a similar sense of wealth is Epernay, in Champagne. </p> <p>\"This place is like Beverly Hills for wine lovers,\" said Bob, my neighbour at the bar at Zuzu, one of Napa's most popular restaurants. A mix of wine bar and gentleman's club, Zuzu has been recommended as a good place to get a feel for America's home of wine. \"The winery mansions are massive,\" said Bob. \"The chances of seeing stars in town are good and your credit card will feel like it's been hit by a stretch limo on Rodeo Drive.\" </p> <p>I scoured the heavy oak tables at Zuzu for local oenophiles such as actor Robin Williams, film director Francis Ford Coppola or jazz singer Boz Scaggs. But to no avail. Maybe they were in the Napa General Store or Celadon restaurant. I took a peek in both as I wandered back to my car, through Napa's bizarrely juxtaposed mix of old mining town architecture and boutique bars and shops. And drew another blank. </p> <p>The ride out of town was along winding avenues lined with trees in the early stages of autumnal change. Sloping far away into the distance in every direction were swathes of vines, similarly changing from green to gold. It is harvest time. </p> <p>Napa's winegrowers have taken from France the idea that the bigger the chateau, the better the wine. The Niebaum-Coppola Winery at Rutherford just north of Napa is the granddaddy of all celebrity vineyards. Francis Ford Coppola bought his first tract of Napa land in 1975, but it wasn't until 1995 that he pieced together again the disjointed Inglenook estate, inspired by the French chateaux of the Loire and built in the 1870s by an Alaskan fur trader Gustave Niebaum. </p> <p>Coppola has spared nothing restoring Inglenook. The staircase was rebuilt by four craftsmen over a year with hardwoods from Belize, where he owns Blancaneaux Lodge deep in the rainforest. </p> <p>If wine is not your thing, there's a museum bristling with artefacts from the director's life, including his cars, his collection of antique zoetropes, film costumes and awards. </p> <p>At the estate of 1978 formula one world champion Mario Andretti, on the outskirts of Napa, there is little in the way of motor racing memorabilia. Tasteful, despite its faux-Italian architecture and accoutrements, not to mention its deliberately faded signwriting, the Andretti Winery is dedicated to quality winemaking, and Andretti is keen to keep the link to his previous life as tenuous as possible. </p> <p>Like other famous vintners, the Italian-born driver has suffered as much as he's benefited from sticking his famous name on a bottle. \"We won a medallion at the LA County fair but the biggest problem is that people think it is a gimmick. They don't realise that my heart and soul is in this place,\" he said as we walked around the property. </p> <p>Mario leaves the fineries of the production to his winemaker Bob Pepi and his team. \"I look at wine making like I did being a driver: I don't know the inner workings of the engine, but you know that when it is right on song your are on to a winner.\" </p> <p>Initially, Andretti was sceptical about Napa's standing in the wine world. Weaned on watered-down wines from Tuscany, then spoiled by vintages on the formula one circuit (he was a regular on Concorde), he scoffed at the concept of good American wine. </p> <p>\"It was an Englishman, of all people, [Jackie Stewart's mentor] Ken Tyrrell, who said 'did you realise there are great wines in America, from Napa?' The next time I was out here racing, I came and tried some out. He was right,\" Andretti recalled, as he wanders into the white-plastered and arched tasting room. </p> <p>The cellar fell silent until a couple asked for autographs. The majority wanted to talk grapes. Mario is happy chatting valves as he is varietals. Then he made his excuses and we headed outside. </p> <p>We jumped in his Lotus Elise and headed out of Napa on Highway 121 - a fast, sweeping series of bends through the pine and eucalyptus trees. Andretti loves this road. Half a dozen miles from the winery, it is his link back to four wheels when the world of wine gets a little too laid back. </p> <p>\"Napa is the perfect antidote to the craziness of my career,\" he shouts above the scream of the engine. \"I think it is probably the same for all successful sportsmen, businessmen or movie stars who get into wine.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Niebaum-Coppola Estate, 1991 St Helena Highway, Rutherford, CA.

Romeo Beckham is going to be tormented throughout his schooldays simply because his parents wanted to display their single scintilla of classical knowledge, and he's by no means the saddest case I've come across. Think of the childhood hell that must have been endured by the TV reporter Nina Nannar, the radio announcer Fenella Fudge, or the journalist Michaela Wrong, and years of cruel playground jibes were surely the reason that Big Daddy (originally Shirley Crabtree) took up wrestling. Even at university, a clarinettist I once knew called Richard Bauwels was always sniggeringly referred to by fellow students as Dicky Bowels. </p> <p>When I told my guest (a Vivian Stanshall lookalike) that we would be lunching at Michael Caines Restaurant, he nodded and said, \"No wonder he changed his name from Maurice Micklewhite.\" I was referring, of course, not to the film star proprietor of Deya, but to the West Country's finest young chef, who lives in the Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel, adjacent to its Champagne Bar, where I tried to con the Viv-alike into ordering a fashionable new cocktail. \"Ask the barmaid for a 'Hands up and give me everything in the till - now!' \" I advised him (a ruse that sadly is seldom successful). </p> <p>On the wall was a photograph of Archibald Leach sipping champagne, a picture that puzzled me until I recalled that the actor better known as Cary Grant hailed from Bristol (not a lot of people know that). And I also remembered that he'd once received a telegram from an impertinent (and tight-fisted) hack asking, \"How old Cary Grant?\" to which he'd replied, \"Old Cary Grant fine. How you?\" </p> <p>The restaurant itself was formerly the hotel's main lobby, and has all the imposing formality of the Royal Courts of Justice. There's something almost intimidating about the Georgian neoclassic vaulted atrium with its Bath stone pillars, arches, balconies, stained glass and faux-Greek statues, which may explain why nobody else had dared to venture inside when we entered at 1pm. As we sat down, a man sporting a garish jacket that made him look like a children's entertainer (or possibly molester) walked in, but lost confidence and quickly slunk out again. He should have stayed, because what Caines and his head chef, Shane Goodway (who studied under Michel Roux), have created here is a gastronomic experience of exceptional intensity. </p> <p>Like the crab bisque, with globules of basil oil floating beneath spume. And the risotto of wild mushrooms in a Gew\u00fcrztraminer sauce with asparagus, far better balanced than the more commonly encountered version with vermouth (which tends to drown the delicate flavours of the vegetables). The pan-fried scallops wrapped in pancetta with an aubergine truffle pur\u00e9e and a lemon thyme jus had Viv-alike raving about Goodway's lilliputian-style cuisine. \"There are hundreds of things in here,\" he mused. \"Bonsai ... not things that have been chopped, just tiny things that have stayed tiny.\" So there were. The first sproutings of a lettuce here, courgettes that never turned into courges there, carrots that never went through puberty. Vegetables that were the victims of infanticide. </p> <p>The lilliputian theme continued into the main courses, such as my pan-fried fillet of Pembrokeshire cod with broad bean pur\u00e9e, peas, wild mushrooms and a broad bean sauce. In particular, the tiny wild mushrooms had been steeped in some sort of fruity wine vinegar, and had turned into miniature squibs, detonating in a series of controlled explosions in the mouth. </p> <p>As for Viv, his fillet of sea bass with vegetables \u00e0 la ni\u00e7oise and a rich gazpacho reminded me of how they used to prepare this percoid fish as a speciality at the Carlton in Cannes. Only the mashed potato was a disaster. Had it been near a machine, which invariably turns honest mash into either wallpaper paste or potty putty? </p> <p>The corpse of milk was overpriced at \u00a310 for the selection. But what a selection, including Keens cheddar and le Troupeau (a handmade Roquefort, and there are precious few of those remaining). Viv, meanwhile, munched through the \"homemade macarons (sic) with a selection of ice creams and sorbets\", which were served in a line, and looked as though (like Monty Python's mouse organ) they should be played rather than eaten, while lecturing me (amateur botanist that he is) about the wild chanterelles I'd just eaten. Apparently, mushrooms have as many as 36,000 sexes, which might make blind dates a bit risky. </p> <p>As we stood up to leave, someone approached him asking, \"Are you Viv Stanshall?\" \"Yes,\" he replied without missing a beat, \"and I have been dead for nine years. But I still find that a good lunch sets me up for the day.\" Not just a good lunch. It was \"perfick\", as the other Mr Larkin once said.</p>",
  "As a newly minted British citizen, I spent the week wrestling with this country's passport application process, but my efforts were accompanied by unpleasant background music, sung loud and clear from Bournemouth. Michael Howard led the tune, with its catchy refrain of \"controlled immigration\". And of course Ukip was singing its own versions of \"foreigners go home\". <p>What a cacophony this produced in my head ... as very recently I had received a letter from the home secretary in my Being a British Citizen pack, praising, in dulcet tones, my \"decision to become a British citizen\". </p> <p>When, earlier this year, David Blunkett announced the creation of US-style citizenship ceremonies I scoffed at the idea. How could the government come up with such feel-good fluff while so many were languishing in detention centres, or were deported? </p> <p>Imagine, then, my annoyance at finding out that these ceremonies were compulsory. Hence my recent appearance at a community centre in Leytonstone, to be welcomed by Waltham Forest council to the country I had been living in for more than five years. </p> <p>During the hour-long ceremony, my cynicism softened. I observed my new fellow citizens - some in jeans, some in hijab - as we pledged, under a serenely smiling picture of Her Maj, to \"give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms\". Was I really in the right country? Could this be the same home secretary that used the Thatcherite expression \"swamping\" about asylum seekers? And isn't this the Britain that produces newspapers with screaming headlines about the threat of \"foreigners\"? </p> <p>As we finished the ceremony with a mumbled version of God Save the Queen, I realised that this was a Britain I had not seen before - one that, just for a few hours, really did seem welcoming. </p> <p>Being American and white, I felt that I had always been out of range of the right's steady stream of rhetorical gunfire. But the struggle isn't unknown to me - try being an Italian-speaking immigrant in the Midwest, as my grandmother was. </p> <p>Herein lies the difference: the US, for all its faults, once welcomed immigration, and built part of its national myth on it - although the nostalgia was more about the Irish in the 1800s and less about Mexicans in the 2000s. But contrast this to Britain, where outsiders are outsiders and the British are British. Many people are working to change this, but the events of this week show there is a long way to go. So, as contrived as these citizenship ceremonies seem, we need them. </p> <p>There may be a paperwork backlog in the Home Office; the government may still cruelly deport people; but one positive thing the country can do is to welcome its new arrivals. It could be the first step in actually making real the idea that we are an inclusive society. </p> <p>The American writer Seymour Martin Lipset argues that being American is an ideological commitment - a person chooses to be American, being born there is no criterion. European identity, on the other hand, is linked to community - it is about the place you are born. In the US, a person can be called \"un-American\" for doing things deemed unpatriotic, but a person can never be un-British, no matter how much they dislike the Queen or Tony Blair. But in this globalised age when economic migration is often not a choice but a necessity; when wars and famine force people to leave their homes; and, here, when the European project is reshaping ideas about nationality, should we not dismiss notions of who we are based on where we are born, and embrace, instead, where we want to be? Britishness is not a birthright - Britain belongs to the people who choose to live here. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:carrie.gibson@theguardian.com\">carrie.gibson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "UK development campaigners welcome Gordon Brown's call for the EU to target \u20ac1bn of its aid spend on the world's poorest countries (Report, October 8). Brown's proposal is timely, given the upcoming negotiation of the EU's comprehensive review of its budget for 2007 to 2013. New proposals from the European commission suggest that EU funds for development be subsumed into a general foreign policy budget - trade promotion, refugee centres and counter-terrorism funded from the same pot as development. This \"fortress Europe\" mentality risks undermining a clearly defined financial allocation for development cooperation. <p>Of course, commissioner Chris Patten is right to stress the importance of aid for reconstruction in the Balkans. But it is disingenuous to say that European aid cannot better focus on tackling poverty and achieving the UN millennium development goals. EU aid to low-income developing countries has dropped as member states have prioritised their immigration, security and commercial concerns in the southern Mediterranean and eastern Europe. Turkey receives almost twice as much European community aid as Bangladesh, and Morocco almost 50% more. </p> <p>If Europe is seriously going to deliver on its rhetoric of tackling poverty, then \u20ac1bn should be just the start. Development needs and the rights of people in poverty should dictate aid allocation.<br> <b> Richard Bennett</b><br> British Overseas NGOs for Development</p>",

  "<p>If your career plan following graduation was to spend the next 40 years quietly pushing pens and counting paperclips in a dreary Whitehall department or small local council office, you've missed your chance. The public sector is finally shaking off its worthy-but-dull image, thanks to the thousands of graduates who can claim, genuinely, to be \"making a difference\".</p> <p>The \"public service ethos\" has always held some attraction. And in recent years, graduates have discovered that the public sector not only offers salaries and benefits comparable to what they might earn working for private companies, but that most public sector employers tend to offer more generous package flexible working arrangements.</p> <p>Now the battle has moved to challenging work. Not long ago the work of public servants was mocked for being unchanging and unchallenging. Today, few other sectors offer the wide range of challenges and high-profile projects as the public sector. Within a couple of years, graduates can be managing budgets running into millions of pounds, briefing government ministers and running programmes whose impact is felt across the country.</p> <p>Take a glance at the past few days' newspapers if you still need to be convinced of the public sector's reach:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Foreign Office organised a major conference on justice chaired by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Leicester city council opened the country's first \"sensory room\" for homeless families with children;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Department for Constitutional Affairs announced a database to help magistrates track down hard-to-find offenders who have defaulted on court penalties;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed details of research into the impacts of climate change on some key UK sectors; and</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Department of Health issued advice to worried arthritis sufferers following the withdrawal of the widely-used anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.</p> <p>In each case recent graduates will have been at the frontline, developing policies, managing projects and delivering services - graduates like Lucy Durling, Laxmi Rao and Jenny Hodgson.</p> <p><strong>Lucy Durling, NHS</strong></p> <p>\"I've always wanted to work in health promotion, so when I graduated from Leicester with a degree in psychology in 2001, I considered working in the private sector in fitness centres.</p> <p>\"But there's such a strong link between deprivation and health that I realised that if I really wanted to deliver a service to people, the place to do it was the public sector.</p> <p>\"I joined the NHS management training scheme which is very broad, based around different placements once you've done a three month orientation.

  "<p>Mrs Sartoris, by Elke Schmitter, translated by Carol Brown Janeway (Faber, \u00a36.99) </p> <p> Margarethe married on the rebound in an \"ice-cold delirium\" and settled into a comfortable routine with a pernickety hubby and a daughter who seems like a stranger. Everything changed after an affair with a dextrous ladies' man, and now she's plotting murder. Schmitter delineates a glassy post-war Germany where nobody mentions the past and everyone keeps their eyes on a tight little future. Margarethe herself is in the tradition of heroines mired in lustreless marriage and delusive adultery. She reads like a Bovary or Karenina who has been through the Xerox once too often: \"The last twenty years unfolded in front of me like a bleached-out map.\" Schmitter's plot unfolds its taut secrets in an excellent translation, especially when Margarethe broods over every tired phrase that's fenced her marriage: \"It's so nice we have the garden!\", \"Did you remember the dog food?\" or \"To us!\" <strong>DJ</strong> </p> <p><strong> East of Nowhere, by Robert Chalmers (Atlantic Books, \u00a312.99)</strong> </p> <p>\"All you need to change your life for ever is one really good idea,\" someone tells disgraced tabloid editor Edward Miller. \"That's right,\" he agrees, \"or one really bad one.\" Shagging his secretary in the stationery cupboard was a bad idea, and being found out was worse. Losing job, home and marriage in a drink-and-drug flurry, Miller flees his shattered life. Despite his staunch xenophobia, he takes refuge in Spain, teaching English as a foreign language (\"it's the middle-class version of mini-cabbing\"). \"He was alone, he was almost destitute and, worst of all, he was abroad\": trouble only doubles when Miller fetches up in freak-show America, in an anti-Lourdes dominated by a psycho on wheels. As the neighbouring refinery belches out fire and sulphur, Miller rebuilds a life. Chalmers writes with enthusiasm, but keeps losing the novel down gaps in credibility - Miller isn't quite plausible as either tabloid rottweiler or new humanitarian. <strong> DJ</strong> </p> <p><strong> Murphy's Favourite Channels, by John Murray (Flambard, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>Welcome to Roe Murphy's life as a square-eyes. In his Cumbrian childhood, neighbours would watch The Brains Trust as if it were wrestling (\"Go on man, and flatten those specky young buggers!\"), so Murphy naturally ends up looking to Armchair Theatre for dating tips and sees his failed marriage in It's a Knockout! Post lefty London, grotty Oxford, 9/11 and foot-and-mouth, he's back in Cumbria, a channel-flipping cable junkie, hitting the button between news, apocalypse and the Irish shopping channel. The world makes its erratic way into his consciousness, while Murphy reminisces and ruminates. He worries that gifted actors are slumming it in Corrie; he's pathetically grateful for Bob Monkhouse. The TV seems to talk back, and chapters pass in a blizzard of satellite dodgems and God-bothering fanatics. There's 50 years of laborious pastiche here, but not a lot of point. I'd have changed novels, but someone hid the remote. <strong> DJ</strong> </p> <p><strong> Small Island, by Andrea Levy (Review, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>What a surprise: even in 1948, the year the Windrush docked and the NHS was born, bigots were accusing the \"darkies\" of coming to England for the free teeth and glasses. Though Gilbert and Hortense come up against the expected narrow-mindedness, Andrea Levy's Orange prize-winner is far from being a litany of prejudice. Ex-RAF Gilbert has been reduced to teeth-sucking phlegmatism by the \"mother country\", but Hortense is shocked to discover white gloves and a Jamaican teaching diploma don't buy acceptance. Only their forthright landlady, Queenie, is colour-blind. Gilbert's story is bitter-sweet picaresque, while snobbish Hortense, with her archaic notions and speech, is to be both pitied and mocked. Queenie, made rebellious and fulfilled by the Blitz, completes Levy's trinity of voices that gently refutes the idea that the story of West Indian immigration had anything to do with teeth and glasses. <strong> IM</strong> </p> <p><strong> A Blade of Grass, by Lewis Desoto (Maia, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>It's a pretty big clue that things are not going to turn out well when you buy a farm called Duiwelskop (meaning Devil's Hill in Afrikaans). And if most of your farmhands have been kicked out of Ezulwini (meaning the Valley of Heaven), then putting in couple of standpipes and giving them the odd lift into town is not nearly enough to compensate for being disenfranchised. Apartheid reinforces the barriers between Desoto's set-piece diffident, vaguely liberal whites and the downtrodden blacks, until Baas Ben gets blown up by a guerrilla landmine and the housekeeper is the victim of a hit-and-run, making unlikely allies of the widowed M\u00e4rit and her maid, Tembi. Desoto makes a clumsy diversion into M\u00e4rit's sex life and adds an unnecessary sexual frisson between mistress and maid. Otherwise his path through the potential complexities of their relationship is straightforward, and despite grief, heroism and armed incursion, without much surprise. <strong> IM</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Dedalus Book of English Decadence, edited by James Wilsher (Dedalus, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>Dedalus is serious about decadence. It has published two general anthologies, a book of Roman decadence and one of German. Best of all is the Decadent Cookbook, which includes a \"gastronomic mausoleum\" and a chapter on \"Blood, the Vital Ingredient\". But this collection of English writers - De Quincey, Byron and Wilde naturally included - feels like a good idea stretched too far. The search for beauty in horror and the pursuit of sensation are all very well (though WS Gilbert's definition of decadence as \"a languid love for lilies\" is snappier), but excesses of imagination produce such histrionics as William Beckford's \"The Caliph... abandoned himself to grief and the wind that ravaged his entrails\" and Swinburne's fantastically improbable heroine Lesbia Brandon, \"poetess and pagan\". Even if you double your dose of laudanum, you will find it hard not to giggle; and giggling is not very decadent at all. IM</p>",
  "<p><strong> Cuba: A New History</strong> by Richard Gott<br> 384pp, Yale, <strong>\u00a318.99 </strong><br> </p> <p>All too often, Cuba conjures up images of a last communist stronghold, Fidel Castro's beard and an American military base holding Afghan prisoners. Richard Gott's invaluable Cuba: A New History dispels many convenient myths. Gott, a frequent visitor to the island, guides us through its troubled history, from the first colonisation by the Spanish in 1511 to the present day. </p> <p>It is a savage story. Even Diego de Vel\u00e1squez, who began with the intention of treating the Indians well, became brutal when they refused to work for foreign invaders. By the early 17th century, Africans brought in as slaves formed half the total population. Racism was always endemic. </p> <p>With the brief British occupation of Havana in 1762, however, the city suddenly became an international port, and North American tradesmen set up business there. Initially, the struggle for Cuban independence involved war with Spain, in which Jos\u00e9 Marti, the great 19th-century poet, was a notable fighter. The United States began to take an interest in the Cuban-Spanish conflict only after the US battleship Maine - which had not been on a war footing - exploded in Havana in 1898, with the loss of 258 American lives. After the ensuing war, the US occupied Cuba for four years. </p> <p>When a new Cuban party, the Independent Party of Colour, was formed in 1907 and launched an armed protest movement five years later, US Marines arrived to protect American sugar cane estates, and in the repression that followed, some 3,000 black Cubans were killed. </p> <p>The influence of Communism, as Gott skilfully explains, now became pervasive. Cuban Socialists were impressed by the Russian Revolution and formed an embryonic Communist Party in 1925. Several of its members were Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. Significantly, the Communists had no prejudice against blacks taking a leadership role in the party. A revolutionary junta was set up in September 1933, led by a mulatto typist named Fulgencio Batista. A university professor, Dr Ram\u00f3n Grau San Mart\u00edn, was chosen as Cuba's new president. He refused to service the debt on American loans and nationalised the Cuban American sugar mills. However, Fidel Castro, in a highly significant 1985 comment aptly cited by Gott, sniped at Grau's - and, by implication, Batista's - claim to be revolutionary in character. </p> <p>The fact is that Communists were allowed to operate legally under Batista and even to launch their own newspaper, Hoy. In return, the Communists promised Batista the political support he lacked. During the second world war, Batista himself became President of Cuba and ruled as a social democrat, welcoming Communists into his government. </p> <p>On July 26 1953, Fidel Castro led an armed attack on the Moncada fortress barracks in Santiago - Cuba's second city. He was arrested after the assault failed and served less than two years in jail before being amnestied by Batista. I would have welcomed more details to explain why Castro was already so convinced that armed insurrection was the only way forward. After all, the author points out that Batista, on winning the November 1954 presidential election, announced the return of constitutional rule and guaranteed a free press. Nevertheless, Castro was proved right: in Batista's second term in power, he became cruelly repressive. </p> <p>In Mexico City, Castro's brother, Ra\u00fal, introduced Fidel to Che Guevara and Gott describes this first meeting wonderfully. The two men initially got on very well. Che badly needed a political cause, while Che gave Fidel valuable insights into other revolutionary experiments around Latin America. </p> <p>Batista fled Cuba on New Year's Eve, 1958, and Castro arrived in Havana as Cuba's new leader on January 8, 1959. Gott might usefully have included at this point a remarkable quotation from a speech Fidel made on May 21 1959, in which he declared: \"Our revolution is neither capitalist nor Communist ... Capitalism sacrifices the human being; Communism, with its totalitarian conceptions, sacrifices human rights.\" </p> <p>Castro's energy was to inspire some of the greatest Latin American novelists of the 20th century, including Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes. He charmed not only Russian politicians like Nikita Khrushchev and African revolutionaries such as Ahmed Ben Bella, but also French intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. </p> <p>It would have been helpful for Gott to throw some light on the sources of Castro's antagonism towards the great Chilean Communist poet, Pablo Neruda, who wrote the first book of praise for the Cuban revolution, Canci\u00f3n de gesta, in 1960. Perhaps Neruda's relationship with Fidel became prickly because a poem in that book dared to remind Castro that the revolution ought to be like a bottle of wine: the work of many men, not just one. The degree of control Fidel exerted over his country's intellectuals was demonstrated in 1966, when more than 100 Cuban writers - apparently on Castro's direct orders - published an open letter in the Cuban government daily, Granma, condemning Neruda for taking part in a PEN congress in New York that year. A wounded Neruda never returned to the island. </p> <p>However, Gott is superb on Castro's political skills and on the Che-Fidel estrangement. Guevara, who saw himself as a 20th-century Don Quixote, had, in Castro's eyes, become a loose cannon, an unstable visionary. Even before Che's assassination in 1967, Fidel had been seeking an opportunity to abandon the armed struggle. (Gott was on hand himself to identify Che's body after the murder.) </p> <p>Gott explores Castro's cautious attitude to the Sandinista overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979. Fascinatingly, Fidel even suggested that the Sandinistas should establish a mixed economy and a pluralistic political system. </p> <p>In some ways, Gott saves the greatest surprise until the last. He writes that he expects little change in Cuba in the years ahead, even after Fidel Castro dies, because \"Cuba has already been governed for several years by a post-Castro government ... Castro himself is now largely absent from the scene ...

When they first met 30 years ago, Greene had read and admired one of Sherry's books - a study of Conrad - and Sherry, who was head of English at the University of Lancaster had, reportedly, read one of Greene's, A Gun for Sale. The biographer was looking for a new subject, and the author was tentatively encouraging. </p> <p>After another meeting in London, Greene was knocked down by a taxi and Sherry made a joke about the incident. Greene liked jokes and it seems that, on the basis of this one, he gave Sherry the job coveted by writers who knew his work much better. He sent his newly appointed biographer a map of the world, with all the places he had travelled to marked in red, asked him not to interview certain women and promised never to lie to him - though he also made it clear that he would not always be helpful. </p> <p>The first volume of biography, covering Greene's childhood, his early suicide attempts and conversion to Catholicism, was well-written and widely praised. The second volume, a patchier affair, appeared three years after Greene's death in 1991. It encompassed the years when Greene was creating his greatest characters, men John Mortimer has described as living \"on the dangerous edge of faith\". There was also Greene's love for a married American, Catherine Walston, which inspired The End of the Affair . </p> <p>With this last volume, it seems that all the fight has gone out of Sherry. The book is badly written, full of lazy assumptions and statements of the crashingly obvious. Borrowing the title of a Greene novel, Sherry has apparently described himself as \"a burnt-out case\", attributing illness and family problems to his exhausting task. </p> <p>His aim, as set out in the introduction, is to recreate Greene's \"total experience in a particular area at a particular time\". To that end Sherry spent seven years travelling the world, tracking down people Greene had known, and even contracting some of the same illnesses (he lost part of his intestine this way). One thinks of Pierre Menard, a character created by Borges, who wanted to think and see like Cervantes so that he could write Don Quixote anew. </p> <p>Here, for example, is Sherry in Mexico, reporting back on the man who inspired the Judas figure in The Power and the Glory: \"The mannerisms Greene noted, including the scratching under his armpit, were repeated in my company, but his way of life made this understandable. His mouth was toothless, the two fangs described by Greene gone, so that what Greene saw and felt, I did not.\" </p> <p>Clearly the lack of those two fangs disappoints Sherry: the \"total experience\" he wants to give us is compromised. But even if Sherry had loved the same women, drunk the same whisky and suffered from the same \"large, painful, internal pile\" it would not bring us closer to Greene on the page. He cannot \"see what Greene saw\" but he ought to be able to do something more valuable and that is show us the man he claims to have known better \"than I know the lines on my face\". Sherry met Greene lots of times and interviewed him extensively. Yet, over the course of 800 pages, he fails to bring him to life. </p> <p>During the years covered here, 1955 to 1991, Greene travelled to Haiti, the Congo and Cuba. He wrote novels including The Comedians, A Burnt-Out Case, Our Man in Havana, Monsignor Quixote and Travels with My Aunt, as well as plays and film-scripts. He championed the embattled regimes of Panama and Nicaragua, and finally lost hope of a life with Walston. His last 30 years were spent in Antibes, close to another married woman, Yvonne Cloetta. </p> <p>Sherry plots all these events, but in his hands we discover little about the feeling or motivation behind them. Many questions remain. Was Greene able to love women only when deceit was part of the equation? Was religion a way to add drama to his work, and to his life? How should we reconcile the \"hollow\", self-hating Greene with the funny and affectionate man his friends remember? Sherry does not do justice to his subject's remarkable generosity - Greene supported, often anonymously, a number of struggling writers as well as a rag-tag bunch of hard-up friends. He makes simple things complicated and vice versa, tossing out that Greene suffered from manic depression, or voicing opinions he seems not to trust himself. Greene never loved anyone as much as Catherine, writes Sherry, adding \"(I might be wrong)\". </p> <p>At other times he is simply defeated by the job of description. Greene was \"special, unquestionably so\", he tells us weakly, while Walston gets the luxury of italics: \"Catherine was <em>special</em>.\" </p> <p>It becomes a challenge to see what we can of Greene in spite of this intermediary. It is like jostling with someone to spy through a key-hole. You want to yank Sherry away, to get a better look at Greene, but his commentary obscures the view. Many of his observations mean next to nothing. \"He is cornered, truth dripping slow,\" Sherry tells us sagely, and elsewhere: \"[Greene] crossed the shadow-line, after casting a savage, sceptical look at his own face looking back from the mirror, over to a consuming vacancy reflected there, in an exhaustion as heavy as the sea.\" </p> <p>The purple prose makes you long for Greene, whose voice remains compelling in letters, diary entries and articles. To Walston he writes: \"I love you dearly &amp; I hate myself so much - &amp; it's the second half that seems to cause the trouble ... there's nothing in life one values like you - not work or children or books.\" And later: \"We are nearly together again - put out your hand.\" </p> <p>It is left to Greene himself to give the most coherent explanation of the moral ambivalence in his work and life: \"[A writer] stands for the victims, and the victims change. Loyalty confines you to accepted opinions: loyalty forbids you to comprehend sympathetically your dissident fellows; but disloyalty encourages you to roam through any human mind: it gives the novelist an extra dimension of understanding.\" </p> <p>There are other mercifully clear voices here too. Rebecca West is memorable on Greene's treatment of treachery. Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Burgess tackle his religious beliefs. Sherry piggybacks on the eloquence of others. But there is very little in the way of new commentary, possibly because Sherry has alienated the available sources or did not dare approach them. Louise Dennys, Greene's niece, editor and friend, was never asked for an interview. </p> <p>After 30 years, and the toll that has been taken on his personal life, it would be understandable if Sherry no longer admired or even liked Greene (he hints that he loved Greene's siblings more). All the same, his subject's legacy is not served well by this final volume of biography. Greene, perhaps, must share some of the blame. The novelist, who was famously careless with his life, may have been careless with his Life, too. </p> <p>It is terrible to read that, hours before he died, and just before falling into a final coma, Greene stopped taking morphia so that he could have a final word with his confessor, Fr Leopoldo Duran, and try to address some questions of Sherry's. </p> <p>And what were the questions? He never even tells us. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Miranda France is the author of Bad Times in Buenos Aires (1998) and Don Quixote's Delusions: Travels in Castilian Spain (2001).</p>",
  "<p><strong> Great Southern Land </strong> by Frank Welsh<br> 768pp, Allen Lane, <strong>\u00a325 </strong><br> </p> <p>At my school in Queensland, a venerable 19th-century institution, the study of history included \"Australia since 1788\". We found this dull, a matter largely of convict transportation, bushed and speared explorers, the squatocracy, the discovery of gold, federation, and then nothing much until two world wars and international success at sport. The \"nothing much\" was largely about emancipation, responsible government and politics. How could this compete with Greece and Rome, the hundred years' war, the Spanish armada and so on? Not that we weren't patriotic, but we were edgily aware of being provincial. We had little appetite for any serious examination of how we became the people we now were. </p> <p>In the 1930s and 40s our popular culture was American, our highbrow British; the cars we drove were Chevrolets and sometimes Studebakers and our school curricula were based on Shakespeare and the English romantics. Somehow we didn't appreciate that the pattern of our lives was sui generis Australian. My 1951 passport was marked \"An Australian citizen and a British subject\". My warrior uncles and cousins were proud of their British origins, while disliking present-day Poms. </p> <p>All this changed later in the century. Self-consciousness became the spur to a generation of historians and cultural commentators. Donald Horne's The Lucky Country and Money Made Us and Geoffrey Blainey's The Tyranny of Distance stood beside Manning Clark's Macauley-like polemics, amplifying the dozens of histories written by academics. Robert Hughes took us back to the reality of the convict system in The Fatal Shore; even Theory threaded its way through our topography with Paul Carter's The Road to Botany Bay. Self-approval and self-laceration amused us and the rest of the world in the shape of They're a Weird Mob, an analysis of Australian vernacular, and Barry Humphries's Dame Edna and Les Paterson. </p> <p>Back home we began to take our arts seriously: Patrick White, Les Murray, Peter Carey, David Malouf and Tim Winton wrote books as widely admired as Sidney Nolan's and Arthur Boyd's paintings. Our films were almost as famous as our movie actors and pop stars. Sydney made a great success of the 2000 Olympics. The story is almost as familiar here as it is at home. It is time therefore to tidy up the record with a compendious and authoritative history. Is Frank Welsh's Great Southern Land that book? </p> <p>Certainly it is direct and thorough, pursuing the whole story from the first European sightings, through Cook's discovery of the east coast in 1770 and on to the British government's despatching of the First Fleet - thence onwards (and not always upwards) to the present-day, even as far as John Howard's revival of \"White Australia\" principles with his ruthless refugee camps for asylum seekers. There is a lot to cover, and Frank Welsh's pace is deliberate, forcing the reader to sweat out nearly 600 pages stocked with facts and statistics. </p> <p>Much is made of the author's being an Englishman, which does set his book apart from the copious \"Made in Australia\" histories which preceded it. Welsh is a sincere admirer of the character of the Australian people, and he pays due tribute to the many instances where the democratic franchise was established in the colonies decades earlier than in Britain. </p> <p>But he has a clear-sighted view of how much Australia owes to the innovative colonial secretaries who guided the political development of a region so remote from London. This remoteness may have been a help to liberal-minded men such as Lord John Russell, Lord Stanley and the Duke of Newcastle. It enabled them to promote experimentation with extended voting rights in Australia, in a way which would have been resisted in Britain - and was consistently resisted among the more successful colonists themselves. The first members of the legislative councils began what is still practised today - property owners and entrepreneurs opposing any improvement of the living standards of workers, and fighting actions against them in the pioneer arbitration courts. Men like John Macarthur, who introduced merino sheep, and WC Wentworth, who proposed an Australian peerage (laughed out of court in Sydney as a programme for \"Botany Bay magnificos\" and \"a Bunyip aristocracy\") were the forerunners of today's Liberal party rightwingers who deplore the red-neck followers of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party but are happy to let them do their dirty work. </p> <p>At the opposite end of the scale, union activists, fighting for better wages and working conditions, have been at the forefront of the \"White Australia\" policy and have resisted non-white immigration, at least up until the recent premierships of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. Even more insistently than in America, money is the determinant - there is no Australian upper class, perhaps because there doesn't need to be. </p> <p>One aspect of Welsh's history would have been very different 50 years ago. Any account of the Aborigines would have been little more than marginal gloss on the development of White Australia. In Great Southern Land it amounts to a very grim parallel text, emerging at every stage of the nation's history. Again, it was the British government which tried to protect the indigenous people, following its general principle that they were as much under the beneficence of the Crown as the settlers. As independence was achieved, the condition of the Aborigines declined. </p> <p>There isn't much about literature, painting or music; sport is confined to cricket other than a short account of the AFL (Australian rules football); surprisingly there is nothing about racing beyond deification of the horse Phar Lap; surfing and its styles go unrecorded; modern day Aussie backpackers only peep out of the text; the bankers, horn players, actors, ballet-dancers and diplomats who have penetrated every part of the globe, even the United States, are hardly to be seen. </p> <p>One welcome aspect of Welsh's fairmindedness is his scepticism about certain over-valued symbols of Australianness - notably Ned Kelly and \"Breaker\" Morant. Alas, no anathema is directed at Rupert Murdoch or Kerry Packer. It is particularly worthwhile that Welsh will not countenance the absurd slurs on British and French troops at Gallipoli to point up Anzac heroism. </p> <p>This is essentially a very thorough history of Australia's political development as an independent nation. The chief paradox Welsh emphasises is how stable the country became early on and remained during 200 years of febrile and unsettled alternation of party political government. His view is that this is one of the most peaceable societies in the world. The only internal battle in Australia, the \"Eureka stockade\" was far milder than the Peterloo or Gordon riots in Britain. The genocide of the Aborigines was piecemeal and by attrition. Even the gold rushes were not accompanied by the lawlessness and murder endemic in California in 1848. </p> <p>How may an Australian best read Welsh? I admired his general presentation but found I got most pleasure when something he recorded matched my own memory. For this reason, I was struck by his account of the collapse of the banks in the 1890s: my own great-grandfather lost everything when, after the 1893 Brisbane flood, the Queensland National Bank ceased trading. Then, under the heading of \"Strikes\", I could read of the Brisbane tram strike of 1912, and remember a photo of my father in his strike-breaking uniform as a special constable. </p> <p>Australia today is not the country I was born into. Probably it is a better place: undoubtedly it is a richer, if not quite a fairer, one. It is no longer Anglo-Celtic racially, but you will see few black faces in Sydney and Melbourne, though a great number of Asian ones. The Scots go on ruling as they have always done throughout the empire. That Australia is not a republic does not mean that it is at heart monarchical: merely pragmatic. There were good omens from the start - the surgeon Worgan of the First Fleet insisted on bringing his piano with him, and one of the most useful early convicts was transported for stealing silver from Magdalen College Oxford. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Porter's latest poetry collection, Afterburner, will be published by Picador next month.</p>"
