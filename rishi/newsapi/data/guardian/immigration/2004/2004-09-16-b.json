  "<b> Yes please barman.</b> You should be so lucky. <p><b> Beg pardon? </b> First you want ice. Then lemons. Where will the madness end? </p> <p><b> I'm sorry?</b> Maraschino cherries - would that satisfy you? Miniature umbrellas? Angostura flaming bitters? </p> <p><b> All I wanted was a slice of lemon for my wife's gin and orange ... </b> Well we've had it up to here with you nouveau Lemon Slicers! </p> <p><b> But lemon slices have been around forever! Everywhere has lemon slices! </b> I suspect you've been spending too much time fraternising with the metropolitan elite, sonny. </p> <p><b> I have? </b> Not everywhere has lemon slices. They don't have lemon slices at the Empire Club working men's club in Rhymney Valley, South Wales. </p> <p><b> They don't? </b> Oh no. Some ponce waltzed in there recently, all airs and graces, and asked for a slice of lemon in his wife's beverage. D'you know what they told him? </p> <p><b> No.</b> \"It's not a cocktail bar you know.\" </p> <p><b> A slice of lemon doesn't constitute a cocktail! </b> Maybe not to you, with your martinis and your sea breezes, but to some people ice 'n' slice is but one step away from a fluffy duck. </p> <p><b> Well what do they drink at the Empire Club? </b> Pints. </p> <p><b> Well I think you're being rather hard on the poor humble lemon. </b> Listen, lemons is where the rot starts. You mark my words: one day it's lemons, the next it's caipirinhas. So henceforth it's ice or nothing. </p> <p><b> But lemons have been popular here since the Middle Ages!</b> Granted. But ice has been around since the Ice Age, hasn't it? </p> <p><b> Well I hope you all get scurvy.</b> \"Lemons are not called for in the Valleys\" - that's what the club steward said, and henceforth that is my mantra. </p> <p><b> Isn't there any hope for the lemonless G&amp;T drinks of the Valleys?</b> \"If there is a demand we will serve lemon with some drinks,\" the club's chairman has since revealed. </p> <p><b> Next week: </b> Lime wedges in the Rhondda - is this progress?</p>",
  "The members of Spain's parliamentary commission investigating the March 11 Madrid train bombings, which killed 192 passengers, went away for their summer holidays in a state of mild disgrace. The commission had been accused by the victims' families of scoring party political points after the election defeat of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar's conservative People's party government instead of trying to find out how and why the attacks happened. <p>So when the commission reconvened this week, it had to come up with something better. It has called on Mr Aznar as a witness - the first-ever call-up of a former Spanish prime minister before a parliamentary commission. </p> <p>This precedent does not seem to have upset the man who governed Spain for eight years. The conservative daily <b> ABC</b> quoted sources close to him as saying \"he is grateful\". </p> <p>But do not count on Mr Aznar to admit that he made a huge mistake by insisting that Eta must have planted the bombs - even if it did help to cost his party the elections. He still sees the Basque separatist group lurking in the shadows, said <b>ABC</b>, which reportedly quoted him as saying: \"I don't discount [that idea]. Sincerely, just as all terrorism is the same thing, all types of terrorism have some kind of connection.\" </p> <p><b> El Mundo</b> was fuming because the commission would not investigate a series of allegations it had published from police informants now detained as suspects. These include claims that an officer provided the bombing gang with its arms and that police are hiding some of what they knew about the gang members. \"Why are you afraid of finding out what happened?\" asked a headline to one story. </p> <p>Now on to the war on drugs, and there was bad news. \"The number of cocaine users is the highest in Europe and now equals the US,\" said <b> La Vanguardia</b>. Only the British and the Dutch can still rival the Spanish in cannabis and ecstasy use by the under-18s. More than a third in Spain have tried cannabis, while one in 15 has tried cocaine. \"We are losing the battle against drugs,\" <b> El Pa\u00eds</b> quoted Elena Salgado, the health minister, as saying. </p> <p><b> El Peri\u00f3dico</b> columnist Alicia Gimenez-Bartlett felt that drug use was a \"sad thing\" for Spain to lead Europe in. \"What is undeniable, above all, among our youth, is the tendency to madly look for the easiest things and, above all, for the easiest pleasures,\" she noted. \"The idea of personal striving, of culture or of work as things of value is rejected. How do we fix that? I've no idea.\" </p> <p>But Spanish children, it seems, are taught from an early age that immediate pleasure is good, according to another statistic. El Pa\u00eds reported that 16% of 6-12-year-olds are now obese. \"The level of obesity amongst children in Spain is the second in the EU, behind Britain and getting close to the 18% of the US,\" the paper said. </p> <p>It also reported that Spain is catching up with the rest of Europe in terms of immigration. The number of immigrants in Madrid has increased fourfold in four years. The capital \"now has 450,000 foreigners, 14% of the population. That is 350,000 more than in 2000\". </p> <p>As schools reopened this week after the customary three monts summer holiday, the importance of Spain's immigrant population became clear. In Catalonia, La Vanguardia reported that 10% of children were from immigrant families. Their arrival had allowed some smaller village schools to be saved from closure, it said. </p> <p>The separatists of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) party - a newly powerful force on the national scene - have accused Spain's new Socialist government of \"fascistic\" tendencies. The reason is because ERC has suggested - in a request to Brussels for those languages to be officially recognised by the EU - that Spain not only has Castilian, Basque, Galician and Catalan as languages, but also Valencian. </p> <p>\"ERC says the government is being 'fascistic' by asking the EU to recognise Valencian,\" El Mundo reported. </p> <p>All good Catalans, however, recognise that Valencian is a dialect of Catalan, even if some Valencians are reluctant to admit it, as the Catalan language associations contacted by Barcelona's La Vanguardia pointed out. </p> <p>Valencia's regional government did not see it that way. \"The Valencian people will not permit the Catalans to impose a decision on this on the central government,\" an angry spokesman told the paper. La Vanguardia assured readers that the central government was \"prepared to correct its request\" to the satisfaction of the Catalans.</p>",

John Neville is the legendary 18th-century teller of tall tales who travels in a hot air balloon made out of underwear in a quest to save a city besieged by Turks; among a cast of fantastical performances, Robin Williams is the king of the moon, a young Uma Thurman is Venus and Oliver Reed the lovelorn Vulcan - a role originally intended for Marlon Brando. </p> <p><strong> Soylent Green</strong><br> (Richard Fleischer, 1973)<br> 7pm, TCM<br> Adapted from Harry Harrison's sci-fi novel, Make Room!

Chiwetel Ejiofor is quietly charismatic as the Nigerian Okwe, slogging away as a taxi driver and hotel night porter; Audrey \"Am\u00e9lie\" Tautou is a Turkish asylum seeker working as a cleaner. The thriller element is slightly overplayed as the pair are drawn into an organ-donor racket, but it's resolved very satisfyingly; and Chris Menges's harsh, atmospheric photography perfectly captures the seedy side of the capital. </p> <p><strong> McCabe and Mrs Miller</strong><br> (Robert Altman, 1971) <br>10pm, Sky Cinema 1 <br>The bleak icy landscapes of the American northwest are just about room enough for this giant double act: Warren Beatty's McCabe is a dreamer, a smalltime businessman with big ideas and a bigger mouth; Julie Christie's Mrs Miller is a realist, a hooker who goes into the brothel business with him for reasons of hard cash. It's a shame bordering on tragedy when he ignores her hardheaded warnings about taking on the mining bosses.

  "Nuclear suspicions were aroused on both sides of the Korean border this week. News of a massive, mysterious explosion in North Korea arrived hot on the heels of the International Atomic Energy Agency's expression of \"serious concerns\" about South Korea's nuclear substance tests. <p>The IAEA's criticism centred on a uranium experiment conducted in 2000. This was \"just a one-time experiment by a few researchers who were induced by scientific curiosity\", said Hahn Cul-hoon in the <b>JoongAng Ilbo</b>. All the same, \"we have to make sure that the talk ... does not become exaggerated\" and attract \"suspicion from international society\". Too late, said the <b>Korea Times</b>; already, \"the government's ignorance and negligence has increased suspicion around the globe.\" That was bad news, added the <b>Chosun Ilbo</b>, for \"if South Korea is perceived as a country that may develop nuclear weapons, we would sustain immeasurable diplomatic, economic and security losses.\" </p> <p>The South Korean press were as one in calling for greater transparency from Seoul. The <b>Korea Herald</b> was not alone in demanding a \"thorough investigation and full disclosure\". </p> <p>The revelation that a huge blast had taken place in Yanggag province last week returned North Korea to the headlines. Pyongyang insisted the mushroom cloud resulted from the demolition of a mountain as part of a hydroelectric project. <b>Hankyoreh</b> was inclined to accept that, but remarked that the attention the incident drew \"speaks of how closed North Korean society is\". The <b>Dong-A Ilbo</b>, meanwhile, was appalled that the North Korean explanation was provided to a visiting British minister, rather than Seoul. \"This act reveals their utter lack of regard for the South,\" it said. </p> <p>In the North, the <b>Korean Central News Agency</b> dismissed \"a preposterous smear campaign\". The \"plot breeders\" had made nuclear insinuations \"to divert the world's attention\" from the South's nuclear record, \"for which they are now finding themselves in a dire fix\". </p> <p>The KCNA could at least bring cheerful news from the ninth Pyongyang Film Festival, which was \"drawing a capacity crowd every day\". One of the highlights, it reported, was \"the New Zealand feature film 'A Young Girl Riding on a Whale'.\"</p>",
  "<p>Blue marlin hooked in the Gulf of Mexico could contain 20 to 30 times the acceptable levels of mercury, according to two Texas scientists. The king of game fish - fierce, beautiful and a formidable fighter - could be a toxic time bomb. Mercury ingestion can lead to kidney damage, liver failure and birth defects in all mammals. </p> <p>Levels in seafood found off the gulf coast have been building up, and oil and gas platforms have been proposed as a possible source, with concentrations of mercury found in sharks and pelagic fishes. But marlin leads in terms of metal as well as mettle. </p> <p>Most marlin caught in the gulf weigh between 200-400lb (90-180kg), but they can grow to 1,000lb (450kg) and live for up to 20 years. They have hearty appetites, and go for the bigger fish, which in turn are likely to contain higher levels of mercury. So the toxic metal concentrates in the biggest predator. </p> <p>This has been the lesson from the top of the food chain in other ecological networks: polar bears are reported to have accumulated levels of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, so high as to affect gonad development; and 30 years ago organochlorine pesticides were linked to egg loss in the higher predators such as peregrine falcons. \"In simple terms, marlin may have more mercury because they eat larger prey and live longer than other fishes,\" said Jay Rooker of the Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston. \"Still, the story appears more complex and we are examining other large pelagic fishes and comparing our results to blue marlin.\" </p> <p>He says sport fishermen might want to think carefully about how much of their catch they eat. \"The mercury levels we discovered were much higher than we anticipated. </p> <p>\"What we need to look at now is the diet patterns of these fishes and they exact locations they've been found. Is there an undeniable link to petrochemicals that is causing these higher mercury levels? We need to find the mechanism that is triggering all of this.\"</p>",

  "<p>As Hurricane Ivan tore across the Gulf of Mexico towards them, the inhabitants of America's most notoriously hedonistic town did one of two things. The majority obeyed a mandatory evacuation order, leaving behind them a ghost city of boarded-up windows and sandbagged shopfronts. The rest got drunk. </p> <p>Bourbon Street, the fabled main drag of the New Orleans' French Quarter, remained a tiny oasis of intoxication as the first gusts of wind began to disturb the languid heat. Stubborn residents and stranded tourists strolled the cobble-stones - drinks in hand, thanks to an unusual bylaw - and tried not to think about the storm that has already devastated Grenada and parts of Jamaica, and prompted states of emergency in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. </p> <p>\"We don't run from hurricanes - we drink them,\" read one sign daubed on plywood, referring to the rum-and-lime cocktail that most bars were dispensing at a dollar a glass. </p> <p>At the Razzoo Club, on Bourbon, the festivities were in full swing by Tuesday night, the partygoers placing their faith in a combination of God and alcohol. </p> <p>\"There's a bigger being taking care of us, so it's up to the good Lord,\" said Midge Starr, a native of New Orleans, emerging on to the sidewalk with her arm around Rico Garcia, from Chicago. He said: \"I'm pretty much stuck here. So when the storm finally hits, we figured, she and I'll go home and have a hurricane party. Just sit back and relax.\" </p> <p>The same went for the monks trapped in the city after arriving for a Catholic leadership convention. </p> <p>By yesterday, no one had much choice. On Tuesday the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, told reporters that \"the window of opportunity to leave the city is quickly closing\", warning that highways heading out of town would be closed by noon yesterday. </p> <p>That was followed by a curfew on remaining pedestrians from 2pm. </p> <p>Haley Barbour, the governor of neighbouring Mississippi, said: \"I beg people on the coast: do not ride this storm out.\" </p> <p>As the last of a dwindling supply of plywood was dispensed from trucks around the city, the local airport, named after Louis Armstrong, shut its doors - as did local schools, at least one oil refinery and five ports along the Gulf coast. </p> <p>Hurricane Ivan, threatening winds of up to 140 miles per hour, was being described by the National Hurricane Centre in Miami as a category four storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, one step down from the worst possible. </p> <p>It was expected to hit land in the early hours of this morning. Late reports suggested that the eye of the storm would be nudged to the north, towards Mississippi and Alabama, by another weather pattern approaching from the west. </p> <p>But the mayor's evacuation order meant little to the sizeable homeless population of New Orleans, who lay prone on the streets as usual. </p> <p>\"That's for people that got cars, got money - it's just to hell with the homeless,\" said Verdell Berry, 47, sitting on the sidewalk outside the Brantley Baptist Centre, a shelter he said was turning people away because of insurance fears. \"We're just sitting ducks.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, the city finally opened the doors of the Louisiana Superdome, usually home to the New Orleans Saints baseball team, but only as a shelter for those with chronic medical needs. </p> <p>What panic there was, as the winds began to pick up, stemmed not from the risk of structural damage, but from water. New Orleans lies six feet below sea level, and storm surges from Lake Pontchartrain or the Mississippi river could lead to scenes reminiscent of 1965, when Hurricane Betsy drowned the city in seven feet of water. </p> <p>\"A hurricane is one thing, but when you're dealing with wind and water, that's different,\" said Larry, a Bourbon Street drinker. \"When you hear stories about the sewers backing up, and snakes and alligators coming up ... you get a little scared.\" </p> <p>Local officials also addressed fears of looting. \"Stay relaxed. We're going to guard your home while you're away,\" said the Jefferson parish president, Aaron Broussard. \"Just don't worry.\" </p> <p>The least perturbed of all seemed to be the handful of British safety experts in town for the 59th Annual Federal Safety and Health Councils Conference. </p> <p>\"As safety professionals, we do tend to make contingency plans,\" one of the organisers, Tony Smith, said. \"But we never expected anything quite like this.\" </p> <p>Another British conferencegoer crystallised the attitude of many out-of-towners: \"We are not scared. We are not scared because we are so naive that we have no idea what to expect.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>imagine.art.after</strong> is an exhibition about the proximity of art and life against the backdrop of contemporary world politics. All participating artists are from one of 35 countries whose people, according to the Home Office, make the most applications for asylum in the UK. The exhibition will take part in two stages during 2005.</p> <p>The first stage of imagine.art.after will be hosted by Guardian Unlimited and will aim to serve as a platform for a dialogue between artists who are geographically separated but culturally related. Artists who are refugees based in London will be coupled with an artist from their country of origin and communicate with them. The artists who stayed and the artists who left will engage in a process of creating cross-narratives about situations in their individual areas of work and life. These may evolve along subtle lines of culture and history, place and displacement, survival and self-preservation. Using images, video and text, the art couples will embark on a journey to produce work, exchange views and engage in a dialogue with the exhibition's team, with journalists and Guardian Unlimited readers.</p> <p>The second part of imagine.art.after will be an exhibition staged at the extraordinary gothic environment of the Union Chapel, North London, where a selection of work created online will take an actual form, as devised and agreed by the artists.</p> <p>The imagine.art.after exhibition team is comprised of curator Breda Beban, artist/independent curator; producer Julia Farrington, Union Chapel Projects; and researcher Margareta Kern, artist.</p> <p>On completion of the selection process for participating artists, the imagine.art.after exhibition team will promote and facilitate an online dialogue between all artists on equal footing. Hardware and training will be provided as necessary.</p> <p><strong>Selection criteria for artists:</strong></p> <p>If you are an artist and/or film-maker interested in taking part in imagine.art.after and meet all of the following criteria we would like to hear from you:</p> <p>If either:</p> <p>1) You are based in London and have gained or are seeking refugee status in the UK and you originally come from one of the following countries:</p> <p>Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Burundi, China, Colombia, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Iran , Iraq, Jamaica, Liberia, Moldova, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Rwanda, Serbia and Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan , Turkey, Uganda, Vietnam, Zimbabwe</p> <p>Or:</p> <p>2) You are an artist and / or film-maker resident, national, and currently living in one of the countries listed above.</p> <p>And:</p> <p>3) You are an artist and/or film-maker with a track record of showing work in this or any other country.</p> <p>4) You are willing to share your area of work and life with the exhibition's team, the journalists and Guardian Unlimited readers.</p> <p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p> <p>Your application must include:</p> <p>- a CV (curriculum vitae, clearly stating country of origin)</p> <p>- six to 10 images of your work in any format (eg. slides, photographs, prints) and/or up to three examples of your time-based work on CD or VHS.

  "The government will double the number of failed asylum seekers removed from Britain by the end of next year, the prime minister indicated today. <p>In a first-person piece for the Times newspaper, he promised a \"step change\" in the deportation rate and acknowledged that allowing failed applicants to remain in the country was undermining public confidence in the asylum system. </p> <p>The monthly number of removals will exceed the number of unfounded applications by the end of next year, he said. </p> <p>Although the government has set no statistical target for removals, latest figures show there were an average of 2,640 new asylum seekers applicants a month in the second quarter of this year.</p> <p>Taking appeals into account, roughly 80% were refused permission to stay in Britain, or 2,112. In the same quarter 3,130 people were deported, or an average of 1,043 a month. </p> <p>Therefore, removals will have to increase by 202% to meet Mr Blair's pledge under current statistics. </p> <p>However, trends show the gap between the number of refusals and removals is becoming smaller all the time, which will make Mr Blair's target easier to meet. </p> <p>Mr Blair said: \"We were right to concentrate first on reducing unfounded applications. </p> <p>\"But David Blunkett and I also accept that we have to increase efforts to remove those who remain in this country when their applications have failed. </p> <p>\"It can make a mockery of our asylum system if those properly denied the right to stay simply flout this decision and remain. </p> <p>\"It is unfair to those who play by the rules and sends the wrong message to those who may try to come to this country without genuine cause. It undermines public faith in the system.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We are gradually closing the gap between the number of failed asylum applicants and the number removed. </p> <p>\"In 1996, the number of removals was equivalent to only 20% of unsuccessful claims. So far this year, that proportion is almost 50%. But I accept we need to do a great deal more. </p> <p>\"Building on our success in reducing applications, we now want a step change in the number of failed applicants who leave this country. </p> <p>\"By the end of next year, we want the monthly rate of removals to exceed the number of unfounded applications so that we start making in-roads into the backlog.\" </p> <p>New laws will come into force next Wednesday making it a criminal offence to deliberately destroy travel documents in an attempt to stay in the UK. </p> <p>Failing to cooperate with redocumentation during the removal process will also carry up to two years' imprisonment. </p> <p>Currently more than 60% of asylum seekers have no documents making it difficult to return them to their country of origin. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: \"Every country in the EU has to face a complex set of problems in trying to remove people. </p> <p>\"The moves we are announcing today are part of a systematic attempt to try to un-block some of those problems. </p> <p>\"The new offences of destroying documents and failing to cooperate with redocumentation and subsequent removal should act both as a deterrent, as we continue to crackdown on unfounded applications for asylum, and help us remove those who have no right to be in the UK.\" </p> <p>He went on: \"Today we are sending a clear signal to people coming into this country. If you are a genuine asylum seeker you have nothing to fear by retaining your documents. </p> <p>\"If you destroy those documents we will penalise you and it will have an adverse impact on your claim for asylum.\" </p> <p>Asylum seekers often destroy their travel documents en route to the UK so they can claim they are a different nationality, or to frustrate processing. </p> <p>Habib Rahman, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \"We are increasingly concerned at the bias in government statements on abuses of the asylum system. </p> <p>\"While abuse must be tackled, we should not lose sight of the fact that an asylum system is in place because there are people genuinely fleeing persecution who require the UK's protection. </p> <p>\"The current emphasis on abuse is misleading and effectively demonises people who look to us for help because they are in danger and share our democratic values.\" </p> <p>A new purpose-built immigration removal centre was officially opened near Heathrow airport this week, helping to boost the total number of beds in removal centres to 2,750 by March, compared with 900 in 1997. </p> <p>Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre started receiving its first detainees in small numbers at the end of August and has 326 bed spaces. </p> <p>Asylum claims have fallen 70% since their peak in 2002.</p> <p>For the Conservatives, the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"We have been here before. </p> <p>\"How many other wild promises will the prime minister make on asylum ahead of an election - only to abandon them afterwards? </p> <p>\"Since 1997 over a quarter of a million failed asylum applicants continue to remain in Britain. </p> <p>\"In his 2001 general election manifesto the prime minister promised to remove 30,000 failed asylum seekers in a year. </p> <p>\"In September 2002 David Blunkett admitted the government had abandoned this target.\" </p> <p>The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Maeve Sherlock, said: \"If people are going to be removed at the end of the asylum process, it is only right that they get a fair hearing in the first place. </p> <p>\"Plans to prosecute people for destroying their documents are wholly misguided.\"</p>",
  "Welcome to the Northerner, Guardian Unlimited's weekly digest of the best of the Northern press <p>____________________________________________________________</p> <p> In the spirit of sympathy and generosity, we will acknowledge this week that the west coast mainline - on which Virgin trains should start tilting later this month but don't hold your breath - does not have the monopoly on misery.</p> <p>They have been suffering in the north-east too, especially on that fast bit of track in Northumberland where the Flying Scotsman used to pant with eager expectation of an early arrival in Edinburgh while passengers sipped their coffee from china cups and gazed out towards Holy Island.</p> <p>You could sense the irritation in the leader published in the Journal in Newcastle.</p> <p>\"Many years ago British Rail used to have the slogan 'We're getting there'. The reality, all these years on, is anything but. Another weekend of track shutdowns north of Newcastle brought misery to commuters travelling from or through the region.</p> <p>\"Passengers were transferred to bus services ... increasing their journey time considerably. Given the state of some of our rail track, this work is extremely necessary and has to be done some time. However, you do have to pity the poor traveller.

At Edinburgh University, for example, the first 10-week term is being replaced with a 13-week semester.</p> <p>But student loan payment dates have not changed, meaning students are having to make money designed to be sufficient for 10 weeks last 13 weeks.

  "Once every four years, America offers its expats the chance to be loved, even to be heroes. Usually no one cares about those of us who live abroad. The US state department isn't even sure how many of us are scattered around the world: somewhere around 6 or 7 million, including dependents, is the best guess - 6 or 7 million pariahs who have shunned 24-hour grocery stores, acres of sky, real football and unlimited refills of weak coffee. If we aren't in the military, our patriotism is in question. <p>But then an election rolls round and politicians suddenly want to hear from us. Specifically, they want us to send cheques. They also want to sign us up to vote, potentially catapulting them into office over the objections of local folk who know better. </p> <p>We expats are a shadowy group. No studies indicate how many of us exercise our right to vote and no exit polls say whether we lean to the left or right. Curtis Gans, who runs the independent Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, reckons there are about 3.5 million Americans of voting age residing overseas, and that these fall roughly into four main groups: military personnel, government employees, people attached to businesses and students. </p> <p>The student vote varies between years, but Gans predicts students will lean somewhat more than usually towards the Democrats in this election. Those in the military and business tended to vote Republican, he said, though he suspected the military would be slightly less inclined to do so this year. </p> <p>The Democrats have not forgotten the Republican tendency of military voters. In 2000, overseas voters tipped the balance in favour of Bush in Florida, though only in the sense that their votes came in last. Every vote counted - except for those unwittingly drafted into the \"Jews for Buchanan\" lobby, those of black voters disenfranchised by their state officials, and other chads deemed too pregnant or hanging - but both Democrats and Republicans walked away with a mission to sign up the expats for 2004.</p> <p>And the important message is voter registration. The process of applying for an absentee ballot can be somewhat complex, but no matter what corner of the world you may be hiding in, this year a member of the party faithful is probably there, ready and willing to get you that ballot no matter what your party affiliation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.democratsabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">Democrats Abroad</a> sounds messianic in its drive to sign up as many John Kerry supporters - or least Bush defectors - as it can flush out at screenings of Fahrenheit 9/11 or international outposts of Krispy Kreme. </p> <p>Margo Miller, the Get out the Vote coordinator for Democrats Abroad in the UK, said the memory of Florida was having a powerful effect on recruiting. </p> <p>\"People are really motivated this year, in part because of Florida,\" she said. She said her volunteers had registered 12,000 voters so far this year and she expected to hit 14,000 before the election, double the total for 2000. </p> <p>That figure does not include the 2,000 voters a day she said were signing up via the Democrats Abroad website, <a href=\"http://www.overseasvote2004.com/\">Overseas Vote 2004</a>, which went live after the Democratic convention in July.</p> <p>Over at <a href=\"http://www.republicansabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">Republicans Abroad</a> they have relied in part on the extensive web of Bush family members, shipping them off to expat havens in aid of cousin/uncle/nephew Georgie. </p> <p>The co-chair of Republicans Abroad, Joan Hills, said George P Bush, the president's nephew, had spent three days in Mexico with the Republicans Abroad co-ordinator last month looking to sign up Mexico's large communities of American pensioners and businessmen. Retired people throughout Central America were being targeted by Republican teams as well.</p> <p>Next week the president's aunt, Nancy Bush Ellis, will make a whistle-stop tour through the UK, France and Germany on behalf of Republicans Abroad. Hills said in Europe the voter registration figures were up around 400% on 2000. </p> <p>Why should we vote for them? The Republicans stress their work to secure advantageous tax breaks for Americans living overseas while the Democrats highlight security, suggesting Bush's foreign policy has made the world a more dangerous place for US citizens. </p> <p>American civilians living overseas feel more exposed now than they did at the time of the last election, but that feeling could cut two ways: either they will feel the president's moves represent the best chance for combating the terrorist threat or they will feel he has squandered the goodwill generated by September 11 with unswerving unilateralism on a number of causes. </p> <p>But for military personnel, the change since 2000 is stark: with a war in Afghanistan and US casualties in Iraq passing the 1,000 mark, soldiers are understandably less interested in hearing partisan speeches than a workable plan to win the peace and get them home. John Kael Weston founded Donkeys in the Desert - aka the Iraq chapter of Democrats Abroad - and from his current position, in the Sunni triangle, he said most service personnel were frustrated by the focus on Vietnam coming from both campaigns. </p> <p>\"All this talk of Vietnam service (or non-service) is a bit surreal when you hear it from the vantage point of an all too violent Iraq,\" he said. He was unimpressed with both parties on their record of coming to Iraq and seeing for themselves what is going on, and has invited both John Kerry and John Edwards for tours. Neither has responded. </p> <p>However, he took issue with the prevailing wisdom that everyone in the military is a Republican.</p> <p>\"The kind of military today in Iraq is heavy on reservists and national guard,\" Mr Weston said. \"It's a new dynamic. My sense is that there will be a lot of proxy votes cast this year from the war zones, with military families weighing in with their over-extended family members serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\"</p> <p>In one sense, though, the overseas military voters would prove far more decisive than their civilian counterparts, Weston said: queues for voter registration were long, and the few statistics that existed suggested members of the military voted in far greater numbers than civilians. </p> <p>\"Soldiers generally take seriously their civic duty, I find. It's too bad more Americans do not, reflected by 50% turnout rates in recent presidential elections.\"</p> <p>Both parties agree that with the election looking like such a close race, overseas voters will play a critical role. </p> <p>\"If it comes down to a fine wire, I would say Republican overseas votes will tip the balance,\" Hills said. </p> <p>Democrats Abroad are afraid of that. \"People have been coming up to us this year and saying, 'I'm so sorry I didn't vote in 2000,'\" Miller said. She will just have to hope her party has found enough voters to register - and that they send back their ballots with the right name on them. </p> <p> <a href=\" http://www.overseasvote2004.com  \" target=\"_new\">overseasvote.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.republicansabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">republicansabroad.org</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.democratsabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">democratsabroad.org</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.fvap.gov/   Federal Voting Assistance Programme \" target=\"_new\">Federal Voting Assistance Programme</a></p>",
  "<p>\"You can get away with anything,\" sings Michael Crawford's Count Fosco in The Woman in White. But, although musicals get away with murder, not even Andrew Lloyd Webber's best score in years and Trevor Nunn's visually vibrant production can disguise the fact that this show is saddled with an impossible book. </p> <p>Not, I hasten to add, the 1860 Wilkie Collins novel on which it is based even though the adaptor, Charlotte Jones, has called it a \"flawed classic\". In fact Collins' novel is a masterly piece of Victorian suspense that tells a gripping story about a young drawing-master hired to tutor a beautiful heiress, Laura Fairlie, and her plain half-sister Marian Halcombe. En route to their Cumbrian home he encounters a distraught fugitive from an asylum who bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura. What follows is an intriguing story of wrongful incarceration, concealed identity and male rapacity. </p> <p>You can't expect a musical to reproduce the novel's innovative narrative technique in which the story is told from multiple perspectives. But what you can expect is a musical to respect its source. Here, however, Jones in trying to give Collins' novel a feminist twist actually lapses into romantic cliche. In the book Marian, although painted in physically unattractive terms, is a bright, resourceful, intelligent figure: one who aids the hero, Walter, in his attempt to uncover the sinister plot against Laura. But, while foregrounding Marian, Jones turns her into Walter's thwarted lover constantly singing \"I close my eyes and I still see his face\". </p> <p>What this does is to patronise the Victorians. Collins was adult enough to contrast the active, courageous Marian with the delicate, shadowy Laura who has what John Sutherland called \"an interesting aura of sexual ambiguity\". But Jones goes further and writes in a highly improbable scene where Marian tries to seduce Count Fosco, the oleaginously plausible accomplice of Laura's money-seeking husband. It's not only against the tenor of the novel but retrogressively implies that women can only achieve their ends through sexual vamping. </p> <p>It's a pity Jones's book isn't better because the show has a lot going for it. Lloyd Webber has written a particularly good score. It starts with a moment of Britten-like eeriness when Walter encounters the woman in white at a misty railway cutting. It expands into lavishly orchestrated love songs. And it gives Crawford's waddling, heavy-jowled, animal-loving Count Fosco a genuine Rossiniesque showstopper in which he hymns his ability to get away with anything even as a white rat crawls around his collar. </p> <p>Nunn's production also deploys visually stylish designs by William Dudley that use kaleidoscopically shifting projections to convey the story's multiple settings. At times, as when the whole perspective rapidly shifts during Laura's ill-fated wedding to Sir Percival Glyde, the effect is reminiscent of early Cinerama. But Dudley's transitions from baronial interiors to sunlit cornfields are impressive and open up new possibilities in the marriage of theatre and cinema. </p> <p>In addition, David Zippels' lyrics are deft and neat: \"until he went to Hades, he was catnip to the ladies\", Edward Petherbridge's hypochondriac Mr Fairlie sings of his late brother. And, although Crawford's Fosco steals every scene he is in, there are good performances all round. </p> <p>Maria Friedman as Marian, although forced into playing the role of the self-sacrificing, love-hungry spinster, renders the role with dignity and style. Jill Paice as Laura and Angela Christian as the mysterious woman in white, bring out the pair's physical similarities and circumstantial differences. And Martin Crewes is a forthright, heroic Walter even if Oliver Darley's Glyde is simply the stock villain from a romantic melodrama. </p> <p>But, while admiring the show's panache, I kept thinking how much better it could have been with a stronger libretto. </p> <p>I don't object to Jones excising minor characters or altering the story's structure: that inevitably happens when you turn a novel into a musical. What I find objectionable is that, in trying to give the story a modern spin and show all Victorian women as social victims, she actually deprives Marian of much of her odd, independent quirkiness that makes her one of the most original characters in fiction.</p>",
  "<p>The Jockey Club was yesterday \"taking a careful look\" at what they can learn from the Hillside Girl case which ended on Tuesday night with the trainer Alan Berry and three others cleared of charges of conspiracy to defraud over the horse's peformance in a race at Carlisle last year. </p> <p>\"The role played by legal representatives in complex cases such as this is increasing, so too is the use of legal argument which goes beyond the charges being considered,\" said John Maxse, the Club's director of public relations. </p> <p>\"The disciplinary panel has a legal adviser and there is no shortage of advice. But we are actively considering adding a legal expert to the panel who will have voting powers. It is a proposal already getting the green light, but it would not come into effect until next year.\" </p> <p>Legal argument will form a crucial part of the various cases yet to be resolved, including those affecting Kieren Fallon and Gary Carter. But Maxse remains confident that the Jockey Club's process for bringing forward charges is \"sound and thorough\". </p> <p>Maxse added that it would have assisted the Hillside Girl investigation if the memorandum of understanding with betting exchanges had been in place at the time of the Carlisle race, in which the filly was pulled up lame after drifting alarmingly on the exchanges. </p> <p>However, solicitor Andrew Chalk, who represented jockey Paul Bradley - cleared of all charges in the Hillside Girl affair - said yesterday: \"The case collapsed because the Jockey Club evidence did not stand up to analysis and did not prove its case.\" Chalk also called for central defence funding to be made available for those the subject of future Jockey Club inquiries. </p> <p>The Hillside Girl case may yet have longer to run, however. \"We are considering the panel's findings regarding Dale Jewett and Steve O'Sullivan using privileged information,\" said Maxse. \"Over the next two weeks we shall decide whether new charges could be presented.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Club's disciplinary panel reconvenes today when the hearing into Sean Fox's riding of Ice Saint at Fontwell in March is due to reach a conclusion. All the evidence in the case was heard last Friday, but the hearing had to be carried over for closing submissions. </p> <p>Fox's controversial ride on Ice Saint resulted in a 21-day suspension as the Fontwell stewards decided he had intentionally stepped off the horse after jumping the ninth fence. In other Jockey Club business, Tony McCoy will have his appeal against a 10-day riding ban heard today. </p> <p><strong>The Prince ready for hat-trick </strong></p> <p>Scottish air clearly suits The Prince, whose recent wins in claiming races have come at Hamilton and, on Monday, at Musselburgh. </p> <p>The 10-year-old can keep up the good work at Ayr today when he looks the pick of the weights in yet another claimer.

  "Tony Blair will today announce a fresh objective of each month removing more failed asylum seekers than the number of arrivals, as part of an attempt to restore credibility to immigration policy. <p>The prime minister is also to highlight the creation next week of two criminal offences, one being to deliberately destroy a passport or other identity document in order to enter Britain illegally. The offences will carry a maximum prison sentence of two years, and are the first part of the Asylum and Immigration Act to come into force. </p> <p>The credibility of the government's programme of removals of failed asylum seekers has never recovered from the moment when the home secretary, David Blunkett, had to abandon the target of 30,000 removals each year set by his predecessor, Jack Straw. </p> <p>Removals reached record levels last year at 13,000 asylum seekers known to have been ejected. But the debate has always been confused by the fact that no specific count has ever been made of the numbers who leave before compulsory action is taken. </p> <p>Mr Blair's announcement of a new objective is an attempt to step up the pace of removals. It is understood that, following the debacle of the abandoned 30,000 target, the new approach will not set a specific number but instead indicate the trajectory of numbers needed in the medium term. </p> <p>Ministers think the public's false belief that nobody whose asylum claim is rejected ever leaves needs to be challenged if political support is to be built for a balanced refugee and migration policy.</p> <p>Initially the increase in numbers will be achieved by stronger enforcement, particularly looking at cases left undisturbed by the inaction of the immigration authorities. </p> <p>However ministers acknowledge that a significant increase in numbers is unlikely until an agreement is reached with the Chinese government in particular to accept those sent back. </p> <p>Fresh ways are also being examined to return rejected asylum applicants to Somalia, at present the number one source of asylum applications. </p> <p>The first of the two offences coming into force next Wednesday makes it illegal to deliberately destroy or discard travel documents in an attempt to enter the country. The second makes it an offence to fail to cooperate with the attempt to give a failed asylum seeker new travel papers so they can be sent back home. </p> <p>Mr Blair's announcement comes alongside plans to introduce an \"e-border\" around Britain, electronically tracking travellers' entry and exit using data collected by airlines or ferry companies.</p>",
  "Police across the country are braced for a wave of protests in the wake of the ban on fox hunting. <p>Hunt followers are planning demonstrations, road blocks and other direct action which could stretch security resources in rural areas. </p> <p>But police chiefs vowed last night to do whatever it takes to enforce the law. </p> <p>Alastair McWhirter, the Suffolk chief constable and Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on rural policing, said: \"Whatever legislation parliament passes will be enforced by the police. </p> <p>\"Those who are currently proposing civil disobedience in response to a change in legislation need to fully understand that we will take action. However difficult that legislation turns out to be to enforce, the police will enforce it.\" </p> <p>He refused to discuss tactics. But after the fuel protests in 2000, Acpo and the Home Office set up a special review group to provide prompt aid by other forces around the country in the event of major protests and blockades, and similar plans will probably be put in place. </p> <p>If the depth of feeling in the villages around Petworth, on the West Sussex and Surrey border and home to the biggest hunt in south-east England, is indicative of other hunting strongholds, the police may face big problems. </p> <p>Tree trunks carried \"no to the ban\" posters, villagers wore their British Field Sports badges and Liberty and Livelihood T-shirts with pride, as others gathered round televisions in local pubs to cheer on the protests in Westminster. </p> <p>The hunt kennels at Petworth House were abandoned as every kennel maid, secretary, stablehand and huntsman travelled to London for the rally. </p> <p>Hunt followers are plotting direct action and many have schemes to circumvent the law. \"There is going to be a battle,\" said Hamish Hiddleston, landlord of The Stag, in Balls Cross. \"The countryside is very angry. There was a plan to block the M1 and M25 yesterday, but it was shelved at the last minute. We'll probably do that when the bill goes to the Lords.\" </p> <p>Many locals believe the ban is just another assault on an already struggling countryside. </p> <p>Dick Ide-Smith, an 84-year-old retired major, declared: \"I've been a member of the British Field Sports Society since 1930 when they first attempted a ban on stag hunting. We defeated them then and we will do it again this time.\"</p>",
  "<p>The NHS yesterday announced it had taken action against its first suspected \"health tourist\". </p> <p>It said an Egyptian businessman's worldwide assets had been frozen and his passport seized until he agrees to pay back \u00a355,000 for free medical treatment he allegedly unlawfully received while in the UK. </p> <p>Albert Girgis, who is self-employed in the import-export business and is based in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, is now unable to leave London. </p> <p>Officials from the NHS counter fraud service served the order on him at a house in Kensington, London, on Tuesday and removed his passport until he pays up. </p> <p>After a spate of anti-immigration stories, the civil action represents a determined effort by the counter-fraud service and the government to crack down on those suspected of getting free treatment in the UK to which they are not entitled. </p> <p>The first identified suspect is not an asylum seeker or illegal immigrant, but a wealthy man. </p> <p>Mr Girgis has been coming to London for heart and lung treatment since 1992, under the alleged pretence that he was a full-time UK resident, the counter-fraud service claimed yesterday. </p> <p>Over the years he has been treated at four top NHS hospitals - the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, the Hammersmith, the Royal Brompton and the Royal Marsden - and obtained prescription drugs that cost several thousand pounds. </p> <p>\"It is unacceptable for wealthy health tourists to exploit the NHS,\" said Jim Gee, chief executive of the counter-fraud service. \"We will not allow NHS resources to be plundered by those who should, and can, pay for their treatment. </p> <p>\"Information received by the NHS counter-fraud service suggested that Mr Girgis entered the UK specifically to receive NHS treatment. Under NHS regulations Mr Girgis should have paid for the treatment he received, which is why we are taking this action to recover the money.\" </p> <p>Mr Girgis may challenge the action against him in a civil hearing. </p> <p>The worldwide freezing order prevents him from disposing of any assets up to the value of the NHS civil claim and costs. He is allowed \u00a3300 a week in spending money. </p> <p>Earlier this year the government launched a scheme to require payment in advance from people seeking treatment who could not prove they were long-term UK residents. It has been unable to say what the estimated cost to the country from health tourism might be.</p>",
  "<p>The National Lottery will hang out the flags on two of its best loved projects, and draw a veil over some of the clunkers, to celebrate its 10th anniversary in November. </p> <p>In London the Tate Modern will be blazing with a special light show, while the Eden Project in Cornwall will transform its lake into an ice rink and its domes into an Arabian nights fantasy. </p> <p>Hundreds of other lottery-backed projects, including museums and galleries, stately homes and sports centres, village halls and health centres, will be staging events or allowing free admission during the weekend of November 6. The Millennium Dome, still a sad grubby shell in Greenwich despite ambitious plans for its reuse, will not figure in the celebrations. </p> <p>Yesterday's announcements were overshadowed by the news that the gates have been locked at the Earth Centre near Doncaster - which had a \u00a335m grant - while a new team takes over. </p> <p>The Botanic Gardens in Wales, featuring another domed glass house, has battled from the start to attract visitors, and come to the brink of bankruptcy. Two millennium lottery-backed projects, the Faith Centre at Bradford and the Big Idea science centre near Glasgow, closed, along with the Pop Music centre in Sheffield. </p> <p>A dozen millennium schemes, including the cursed Bath Spa project, have yet to open.</p>",
  "<p>Few of us, I think, would rejoice in having a person in Batman suit for a father. Particularly when the twerp in question has a record for harrassing the mother of two of his children and was allegedly overheard, more recently, bragging about the prodigious number of women to have enjoyed the favours bulging to one side of his Batman knickers. And yet Jason Hatch of Fathers4Justice has got himself quite a distinguished following. </p> <p>Yesterday, in these pages, Hatch and his comrades were even likened to the suffragettes. Who obviously missed a trick in not going in for fancy dress. For although F4J's children's party costumes are sometimes deprecated by those who go on to approve its campaign, it seems unlikely that anyone would have warmed to the men, even taken much notice, had they performed their various feats in civvies. In ill-fitting, babyish outfits that contrived to make them look more little-guyishly plucky (or creepy) than oikish, they elicited support and admiration from the most unlikely places. </p> <p>Bob Geldof, meanwhile, thinks them \"great and brave\". One of our leading young historians urges them on. Even the law-abiding Daily Mail can't resist this nifty new angle for getting one over on women, whose intransigence has apparently created \"these men driven to desperate measures to get their stories heard\". </p> <p>Although one could easily get the impression that the main reason for the stories is to get the desperate measures on telly. If we didn't know, from numerous interviews, that Hatch has the interests of two of his children at heart, his penchant for sneaking up, or into, forbidden places might look more like a hobby than a cause. In another era, perhaps he and his mates would simply have gone out poaching or ratting, grumbling about bloody women along the way. </p> <p>Today, for men who crave camaraderie and thrills but can't afford to go shark-fishing or bungee jumping, Fathers4Justice presents itself as inexpensive, all-male extreme sport, with the added frisson that comes of its also being a crusade and a covert operation. If only more of its members were still cohabiting, it would be a brilliant way of getting away from her indoors. \"Could you change the baby, dearest?\" \"Sorry love, the lads are expecting me on Clifton Suspension Bridge. Where's my Batman suit?\" </p> <p>(Actually, it seems that Hatch, last seen acknowledging the crowds from one of her majesty's ledges, is already in the doghouse. Gemma Polson, the mother of their seven-month-old daughter, has reportedly left him, and says: \"Fathers4Justice has taken over his life. He had told me he was going to give it all up - but then he goes and does this at Buckingham Palace.\" If only he had chosen angling.) </p> <p>Naturally, the ambitions of Fathers4Justice go beyond seeking satisfaction for its premier activists. On its website, the organisation introduces itself as \"a new civil rights movement campaigning for a child's right to see both parents and grandparents\". Which would not be such a bad idea, if the rights in question weren't going to be enforced by warring adults. And there is, it turns out, a reason why F4J is not called P&amp;G4J. In practice, \"parents and grandparents\" turns out to mean a \"dad's army\" which the organisation has been, as it puts it, \"mobilising\" to fight the authorities which support \"recalcitrant mothers\". </p> <p>Remarkably little evidence is produced to account for this declaration of war. While it is true that some mothers behave vengefully and deny their children's best interests, there is nothing to support the view that such behaviour is either prevalent, or officially approved. On the contrary. A new government green paper, \"Parental separation: children's needs and parents' responsibilities\", notes that most \"non resident-parents\" have weekly or more frequent meetings with their children. It finds that in around 90% of cases, child contact arrangements have been agreed informally by separated parents, of whom, more than 80% profess themselves happy with the arrangement. This does not, in short, conform with the F4J blighted vision of \"a nation of children without parents and parents without children\". </p> <p>In reality, where there is dissatisfaction with the arrangement this is often because the resident parent - usually the mother - thinks there has been too little, not too much, contact with the the father. If F4J's main concern is genuinely that children should see both their parents, it has launched its dads' army at the wrong sex. </p> <p>Compared with the number of men who say they want but are denied contact, says Gwen Vaughan, the chief executive of Gingerbread, \"there are far more fathers who have no contact with their children whatsoever\". The men have dropped out of their children's lives. \"The idea that mothers are bleeding fathers dry and refusing them access is certainly not the main picture that we see,\" she says. \"They would like more, not less, supportive parenting involvement from their ex partners.\" </p> <p>If Fathers4Justice is happy to rest much of its case on anecdotes told by individual, often justifiably embittered members, it is surely reasonable to point out that there are many other stories to be told, in which mothers heroically put aside their personal feelings about unreliable, abusive, violent, or possibly criminal former partners purely for the sake of their children. There are more in which fathers, for all that they claim to have their children's interests at heart, use the courts to prosecute a feud with an ex-partner. </p> <p>Since children are not, as Lord Falconer has pointed out, to be divided up like CD collections, it is not terribly surprising that when these cases go to court many more parents profess themselves unhappy with the outcome. They must have been pretty unhappy before they got there. Those of us who have never been through one of these ghastly battles like to point out, the more piously the better, that such parents really ought to put personal animosity aside. But if they can't, the courts will have to do it for them; occasionally deciding that shared parenting, in this battleground, may no longer be the best outcome. Even so, where parents go to court for contact, only 0.8% are refused. But this sort of objection is unlikely to make much difference to the F4J men's approval ratings, at least while mothers seem so reluctant to dress up as cartoon figures and throw purple condoms at people. </p> <p>Still, we can agree with Mr Hatch and his gang on one thing: the children's interests should come first. Which means all the fathers in themed romper suits must get down from the walls immediately, stop showing off, and behave nicely. And what goes for them goes for everyone who has been encouraging this silly nonsense. At their age, they really should know better. </p> <p><strong>Back on song, Blair tries to woo us back</strong></p> <p>Whatever the TUC felt about the content of Mr Blair's address to them on Monday, they should surely feel flattered to have been the beneficiaries of what seems to me to have been, if not one of the great Blair speeches, certainly a hint that we may expect, come conference, a return to glorious, shameless form. The glimpse of a Blair in full song was there not only in his bold reworking of Shakespeare - \"I come here to praise Warwick not bury it. To advocate social partnership not belittle it\" - but in a plangent bit of phrasing that seems to be his very own: \"Even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back.\" </p> <p>Assuming Mr Blair did not copy this off the inside of a greetings card with a little bear on the front holding a pale blue balloon and saying \"Sorry!\", it suggests an intriguing new shift in his rhetorical style, from the visionary who gave us a \"new young country\" to a sadder but wiser kind of guy who hopes we can learn to love again. </p> <p>A bit like Steps in Since You Took Your Love Away: \"I need to find a way back, And I don't know if I'm strong enough ... You took your love, oh baby, no I need you.\" Could Blair's TUC phrase even be a quote from one of his own, as yet unpublished, songs? \"Even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back, ooh yeah baby, Even if we used to disagree, There's nothing I can do about Iraq, I'm sorry baby ...\" Can't wait.</p>"
