  "<p>Nasa engineers spent a weekend on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic, 690 miles from the north pole, testing a technology for drilling a hole on Mars. While Britain was gingerly preparing to invest \u00a35m in Europe's Aurora programme - centred on a proposed rock-collecting mission to Mars - a team from the Johnson Space Centre in Houston took a lightweight, low-powered rock drill to the Eureka weather station: the nearest thing on Earth to the dry, freezing conditions of the red planet. </p> <p>Nasa worked with McGill University and the University of Toronto, as well as the oilfield company Baker Hughes of Houston, Texas. Because it is designed for use not so much offshore as off-planet, there are limits to what it can do. This second-generation version of the instrument consumes about 100W - a bright household light bulb - and it cannot use a drill pipe or drilling mud. At Eureka, the instrument was tested on sandstone and rock outcrops, and ice. At intervals, the drill is pulled to the surface by its tether to remove the core and cuttings. </p> <p>Britain's ill-fated Beagle 2 made the epic journey to the red planet with a tiny mole that could drill to a metre, to retrieve rock and soil samples for chemical analysis. The Nasa instrument, too, is intended to secure core samples for scientific study. </p> <p>Jeffrey George, manager of the Mars drill project, said: \"Later versions eventually would drill for resources, like possibly subsurface water on Mars. </p> <p>\"We believe the third or fourth generation will be ready for the moon or Mars. It should ultimately be able to drill to depths of several hundred metres.\" </p>",
  "Iraq's insurgency spread to a relatively calm area near the Syrian border yesterday when a suicide car bomber killed at least 16 people at an Iraqi National Guard centre. <p>As US and Iraqi forces extended efforts to restore security in rebel-held regions ahead of January elections, the western settlement of Ana became the latest town to be sucked into the violence. </p> <p>Witnesses said a car sped towards the military garrison on the edge of the town where recruits were applying to join the National Guard, and exploded. Doctors said 16 people had been killed and 24 wounded. </p> <p>Ana is west of the notorious Sunni triangle, where many of the rebel attacks outside Baghdad have been staged. US and Iraqi forces persisted with counter-insurgency operations yesterday, turning their attention to an insurgent stronghold south of Baghdad that includes the troublespot towns of Mahmudiya, Yusufiya and Latifiya. </p> <p>Joint forces rounded up 160 suspects, seized a suspected training camp and took control of a bridge on the first day of the assault in the area, the US command said. The bridge is believed to be a favoured corridor linking insurgent areas around Baghdad, Falluja and towns further south. </p> <p>Elsewhere, a roadside bomb exploded in Basra as a British patrol was crossing a bridge, killing one Iraqi and injuring 10 others, police said. There were no reports of British casualties. A Kurdish tribal leader and a companion were shot dead in the northern city of Mosul. </p> <p>The wave of violence has raised questions about January's elections, but the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told a Baghdad audience yesterday that it was only part of the story. \"There is another story going on of the new Iraq seeking to break out of the oppression and tyranny of Saddam and also from the oppression and tyranny of the terrorists.\" </p> <p>A deal with rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to bring peace to the eastern Baghdad slum known as Sadr City remained elusive meanwhile, though both sides hinted at progress. </p> <p>Under one tentative plan, militia fighters loyal to the influential cleric would turn in their weapons in exchange for cash and immunity for most fighters from prosecution. </p> <p>Iraqi police would take over security responsibilities in Sadr City and American forces would only enter the district with the approval of Iraqi authorities. </p> <p>But the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, said there was no ceasefire yet in the weeks-long battle for the neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"We responded positively to the request of the people of Sadr City,\" he said. \"They will surrender their weapons to the authorities. They will dismantle any armed presence in the city. They will respect and abide by the rule of law in the city. They will welcome the police to go back, patrol the streets of the city.\"</p>",
  "Two weeks ago Israel Reyes Montes was just another Latino builder in Las Vegas. But when his murdered wife was elected mayor of the impoverished village he had left behind in Mexico, Mr Montes returned home to take her place. <p>Guadalupe Avila Salinas, the candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, was shot four times in the back a week before Sunday's municipal election in the Mexican region of Oaxaca. </p> <p>Her alleged assailant, who is still on the loose, was her political rival and the former mayor of the village, C\u00e1ndido Palacios Noyola. </p> <p>The murder allegedly took place during an argument between the two outside a health clinic. </p> <p>But the crime occurred so close to the election that officials were unable to remove the dead candidate's name from the ballot. </p> <p>So party officials asked the bereaved widower to take her place. </p> <p>Although he initially refused, having emigrated just two years before, the local party committee was able to change his mind. </p> <p>Mr Montes, whose late wife won 159 votes, beating the Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate into second place, will take up office on January 1. </p> <p>Ms Salinas, a lawyer, had threatened to open up the books of the previous mayor and her presumed assassin, accusing him of misuse of public funds. </p> <p>The accused's nephew, charged with being an accessory to murder, told police that he knew his uncle \"had a problem\" with Ms Salinas.</p>",
  "Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, flies to Libya today for talks with President Muammar Gadafy against a background of mounting crisis over the arrival and expulsion of unwanted immigrants. <p>Italy yesterday resumed airlifting hundreds of would-be immigrants who have landed in recent days on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa. Human rights groups have condemned the expulsions as a violation of the migrants' right to apply for refugee status. </p> <p>The UN high commissioner for refugees has also expressed concern and complained that its representatives have not yet received clearance to speak to the would-be immigrants. </p> <p>The airlift was suspended on Tuesday. The government has not provided an explanation, but according to some Italian media reports Libya refused to take back the deportees. </p> <p>Four C-130 military aircraft, each carrying around 90 migrants, were due to take off from Lampedusa yesterday. By last night it was expected that only 250 of the 1,000 or so arrivals would be left in a reception centre on the island that is designed to take less than 200. </p> <p>Apparently oblivious to Italy's hard line, a further 21 would-be immigrants arrived in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday on an inflatable launch. Most recent arrivals have turned up in Italian waters crammed aboard unseaworthy vessels that have been cast loose by traffickers operating from the Libyan coast. </p> <p>Mr Berlusconi's visit to Tripoli will be his second in less than two months. He last met Colonel Gadafy on August 25.</p>",
  "The candidate roars into the rally in a giant articulated truck, all gleaming chrome and tinted windows. The face plastered along the side of the lorry, muscles bulging beneath a taut white T-shirt, is the same as that just visible through the windscreen of the truck. <p>The lorry pulls to a halt, the door swings open and a cowboy boot daintily points down to the running board, followed by the rest of the candidate. The hair! The eyebrows! The tan! The sports jacket! The slacks! It is a thrilling composite, a psephologist's wet dream. </p> <p>He stands, poised in the door of the cab, waving to the cheering crowds, his face fixed in a grin, one hand outstretched with a thumb poking up like a fingerpuppet. He doesn't speak; he merely gazes into the distance, scanning the crowd, as if waiting for the director to shout, \"Cut!\" </p> <p>But there is no director and there is no crowd - unless you count the gaggle of journalists summoned for the occasion, the police, the staff and the half-dozen curiosity seekers, the only real people present at this factory on the outskirts of the outskirts of Los Angeles. Actually, there's no campaign either, though much of Arnold Schwarzenegger's first year in office as governor of California has born a distinct resemblance to one. </p> <p>By now the governor is getting tired of standing on the steps of the giant truck. You can see questions starting to arise in his eyes: should I stop waving now? Do I grin or adopt my serious expression at this point? How will this play on TV? </p> <p>Schwarzenegger eases himself down from the step and with obvious relief starts to talk to the 20 or so people gathered behind a line of police barriers. \"Very nice,\" he says, grinning and nodding and proferring his thumb. </p> <p>He makes a nice little speech about bringing business back to California - he is here to highlight his efforts to reverse the migration of small businesses to states where labour costs are lower - and gets on with the main business of the day, the photo op. </p> <p>Like so much of his political life, the photo op gently plays on Schwarzenegger's previous lives as movie star and bodybuilder. He lumbers with his strange, steroid-laden gait along the side of the truck to help two workers - they look too real to be actors - unbolt its rear doors. The truck, like the workers, is emblazoned with the slogan, \"Arnold says: California wants your business.\" (Actually, he says \"Kah-li-fornia\".) It's knowing and funny, mocking his Austrian origin and his comic mittel-European accent, unexpected in a holder of one of the most powerful political offices in the land. </p> <p>The back doors of the truck swing open to reveal a pile of cardboard boxes bearing the slogan, \"Arnold's Moving Co\". </p> <p>\"This is a really heavy box,\" he says, grunting, as one of the workers passes him a box to place on a trolley. Schwarzenegger likes to play. He mugs for the cameras, staggering under the impossible weight of the boxes, before handing one to the slight owner of the company who, being less of an actor than the politician, places it with no apparent effort on the trolley. Everyone laughs. This is fun. This doesn't matter. This is politics: it's just like showbusiness. </p> <p>This is a typical Schwarzenegger event, a standard ingredient in a day in the life of the man who a year ago today was voted in as governor of the state with the seventh-largest economy in the world. Back then, everybody took it for a bit of a joke. Sure, there had been an actor before as governor of California, one who even went on to become president, but he at least had served his political apprenticeship, having worked his way through the smoke-filled rooms of the Golden State. What would, or could, Schwarzenegger do? </p> <p>A year on, Schwarzenegger has been hailed as the great healer, derided as the great divider, garlanded for bringing a new spirit of bipartisanship to Californian politics, attacked for merely telling people what they want to hear. The contradictions are endless and confusing. To his detractors they show the tactical naivety of a political novice, the crass approach of a Hollywood star accustomed to a chorus of yes-men. To his cheerleaders, they are all part of his master strategy to disorientate the opposition, break the mould of politics as usual (sound familiar?), crack heads together and focus minds. </p> <p>\"Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scoundrel,\" says Californian Democratic party strategist Bob Mulholland. \"He's not a man who keeps his word. He'll look you in the face, make a pledge and then an hour later will say the opposite. His tenure has been all sizzle, no steak. He's acting as if he's still on stage. Truth or lies, it's of no concern: he's lied all his life to promote his career.\" </p> <p>Taken on its own, his record in office is distinctly underwhelming. He was elected on two populist promises: to resolve California's budget crisis and to reform the political culture in the state capital of Sacramento. Today, the budget crisis is as bad as it was a year ago. Schwarzenegger was eventually able to push through a budget, but it was late and merely rolled over the $12bn debt into the coming years. And despite his populist rhetoric, the political culture in Sacramento runs along pretty much as before, with Democrats and Republicans sparring, doing deals and being swayed by lobbyists. But Schwarzenegger's poll ratings remain in rude good health, with 65% saying that they think he's doing a good job. </p> <p>\"He's more of a politician than anybody expected,\" says Marc Cooper of the LA Weekly. \"He's certainly more of a politician than your average politician. To be an effective politician, you probably have to be a good actor.\" </p> <p>\"He wears risers in his boots,\" counters Mulholland. \"He's a 5ft 10in citizen of Austria who believes his real place in history is to be president of the United States. You've got to be distrustful of a politician who has a makeup artist with him 24/7.\" </p> <p>\"His real gift is to let people see him as the Terminator and see the characters he's played,\" says Jamie Court, founder of ArnoldWatch.org, a website devoted to cataloguing the governor's relationship with big business. \"And they don't pay much attention to what he's done. What he's proving is that all politics is showbusiness. He's a brand.\" </p> <p>Even half a minute spent listening to a Governor Schwarzenegger speech bears out much of what Court says. He doesn't let a speech go without saying, \"I'll be back\", or making liberal use of the verb \"to terminate\". His everyday speeches are littered with verbal plays on bodybuilding and the terminology of action heroes. </p> <p>But it goes beyond image. In a move borrowed from the control freakery of Hollywood, the governor's staff have to sign confidentiality agreements, pledging not to disclose anything about Schwarzenegger. And he has also entered into an unholy alliance with the tabloid press. </p> <p>Political writer Ann Louise Bardach documented Arnold's tabloid dealings for Los Angeles magazine, disclosing how he entered into a business agreement with the biggest tabloid group in the market, publisher of the National Enquirer, among others. \"There was a series of meetings,\" she says, \"which put the tabloids out of running stories about Arnold Schwarzenegger's past and they became cheerleaders. They totally flipped the coin. It became Arnold the great family man. He basically delivered a knock-out punch.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Schwarzenegger's most enduring contribution to the evolution of political discourse during his first year in office will be the rebirth of the phrase \"girlie men\". It first appeared in an old TV skit on Saturday Night Live, where two pumped-up bodybuilders with funny accents threatened to kick sand in the face of all and sundry. Everyone laughed, including the butt of the joke, Schwarzenegger. After all, it was just a sketch. </p> <p>And then, demonstrating self-awareness and a facility with his own history, Schwarzenegger used the phrase this July to describe his political opponents in the midst of a fraught attempt to pass the state's budget. Less than two months later, he used the phrase again, this time at what was billed as the crowning moment of his debut year in politics, a prime-time speech at the Republican party national convention in New York. \"The girlie men flap\", as one Republican national official referred to it, gives an insight into Schwarzenegger's approach. The remark was far from spontaneous: it referenced Schwarzenegger's past life, it showed the governor to be both human and tough, and it confirmed the notion that the old political system was somehow to blame. </p> <p>It also represented a turning point, the point at which nice conciliatory, bipartisan Arnie - the one being cute with the kids in Kindergarten Cop - gave way to the bullying, scheming, hard-assed Arnie, not so much the one in the Terminator films as the Arnie glimpsed in his breakthrough movie, Pumping Iron, the documentary where he plays mind games on his opponents and psychs himself to a sixth Mr Universe title. </p> <p>\"A Democratic staffer early on called him a wuss,\" says Dan Walters, veteran political columnist for the Sacramento Bee. \"In the early confrontation,s he blinked. Once that happened, the Democrats started to lose their fear of this dominating figure. It appears that he was taken aback that his gestures to the Democrats were not reciprocated and you've seen him try to get tough. But it's harder to get tough when you've been soft.\" </p> <p>So Schwarzenegger learned the hard way that being nice to people in politics doesn't necessarily win you friends. </p> <p>\"In Hollywood it doesn't matter how good you are, it depends on how popular you are. In politics, popularity is great but it doesn't do any good if you don't use it, it just goes away. To have some impact, he can't say yes to everybody.\" </p> <p>The past few weeks have seen a hardening of the Schwarzenegger stance on many issues. He has been busy wielding his veto on a long list of bills that many liberals hoped he might support, from the granting of driver's licences for undocumented immigrants to allowing prescription drugs to be purchased more cheaply in Canada and increasing the minimum wage. His arguments in favour of veto are almost always economic, taking the view that regulation will hinder job creation: he might be quoting his close economic adviser, Milton Friedman, the man who brought monetarism to Britain in the 1980s. </p> <p>Has Schwarzenegger been a success as a politician? In many ways, it really doesn't matter. Schwarzenegger is an illusionist. Like that other pre-eminent Republican, George Bush, what he believes, goes. What he sees, and chooses to see, is what is real. If Schwarzenegger does not see it, it does not exist. If Schwarzenegger does not promote it, it is dead. All can be swept away by the power of positive thinking. </p> <p>Does his positive thinking take him so far as to dream of occupying the White House? This week, for the first time since the 1870s, a senate committee considered an amendment to article 2 of the US constitution, which requires that a president be a \"natural born\" citizen of the country. The amendment, sponsored by Schwarzenegger's old friend, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, would make citizens of 20 years eligible. Schwarzenegger, who has dual Austrian-US citizenship, took the oath in 1983. Another friend of the governor's has set up a website to lobby for the amendment. </p> <p>In New York during the Republican convention much of the chatter centred on the possibility that the way might be eased for Schwarzenegger to take a shot at the presidency. The succession to Bush was the subtext to the September jamboree, with Vietnam veteran John McCain and former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani the names most talked about. But many senior Republicans reason that the appeal of Schwarzenegger might be too strong to resist. </p> <p>\"He has his eye on the presidency, no question,\" says Bardach. \"The big figures in the party said that he's pushing very hard, and these other guys look at him as a competitor.\" </p> <p>In public, the candidate himself is mute on the subject, talking instead about the task at hand when asked about his ultimate ambition. And the pundits - citing everything from the constitution to Schwarzenegger's sleazy past - and even some of the facts, point against the Austrian-born governor becoming US president. </p> <p>\"This guy is George Bush with a personality and big biceps,\" says ArnoldWatch's Jamie Court. \"If we change the constitution and allow him to become president, you'd better watch it.\"</p>",

  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p> <b> &gt;&gt;&gt; FROM BOURNEMOUTH</b></p> <p>The Backbencher caught up with the Guardian's political correspondent Nicholas Watt and asked him about the mood among the Tory faithful.</p> <p>\"The sun has come out and it's pretty warm in Bournemouth today, and that matches the mood of a lot of the Conservatives here. They know that they're in a pretty desperate position in the polls, but they were all encouraged by Michael Howard's speech. It was brought forward - normally the Tory leader speaks on Thursday, but he spoke on Tuesday, to try and define the week. There was a definite feeling that he had a difficult job. He couldn't do a tub-thumping speech, appealing to the party in an emotional way, because the feeling is that that's what Tony Blair has done for the last few years and people are turned off by it. So it had to be low-key, but being low-key means that people might say 'so what? What are you saying?' The feeling is that Mr Howard got the balance right, and MPs on all sides of the party - including many who have spent the last 10 years criticising and backbiting about Tory leaders - were quite encouraged.</p> <p>\"So there's a good mood here, but it's a realistic mood. They are not saying, privately anyway, that they are about to storm down Downing Street. It's 31 weeks today until the expected general election on May 5, and on that day they should all be taking their cabinet posts with their 'timetable for action'. But I was speaking to one senior shadow minister today and he laughed at the prospect that he would be joining the cabinet. 'There will be no Conservative cabinet in seven months' time,' he said.</p> <p>\"Today is much more of a policy-intensive day. If yesterday was about broad themes, today was policy-heavy. We had David Willetts talking about pensions this morning, and the key speech of the day was by David Davis. And it was really a very tough speech, especially compared with those of recent years when the emollient Oliver Letwin had the job of shadow home secretary - a much more liberal one than David Blunkett, too. </p> <p>\"None of that today from Mr Davis. He was very tough on immigration, and came out with a sentence that might well be picked up: he talked about how a Conservative government would substantially cut immigration into Britain, and then he said 'uncontrolled immigration endangers the values which we in Britain rightly treasure'. Critics may well say that he is straying into the highly sensitive territory that Margaret Thatcher famously trod in the 1979 general election when she talked of Britain being 'swamped' by immigrants. But the Tories believe immigration is an absolutely key area, and they think that if they could define themselves on that in a general election, they could scoop up the Tory voters who have been abandoning the party in recent years.</p> <p>\"They also believe that law and order is going to be another defining issue in the general election, and Mr Davis gave a tough message on crime. He said 'criminals should be afraid', and accused Labour of being soft on it. He used a very emotive video to show that - a pensioner giving a tragic account of how his wife was murdered in front of him by a criminal in their house. But that could happen under any government, and it could be seen as a slightly cheap way of using somebody's tragic circumstances.\"</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Congratulations to James Donally, who - unlike many entrants - was able to recall the slogan of last week's Labour party conference, A Better Life for All. \"I think you have to let me win as I must be the only Backbencher subscriber living in Turkmenistan, whose President for Life is not short of a catchy slogan himself.

Much worse, however, was the headline in Tuesday's Le Monde: \"Peter Mandelson sera l'un des 'poids lourds' de l'equipe Barroso\" - which, roughly translated, means that Mandy will be the HGV of the new European commission. Heavyweight is one thing, but being compared to a lorry is another. Or could the paper have been alluding to one of Tim Yeo's pledges this week? \"I'll scrap Labour's planned Lorry Road User Charge and instead help British hauliers compete on level terms with continental trucks.\"</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; CHARM OFFENSIVE (PART 1)</b></p> <p>The Backbencher is far too discreet to reveal the surname of the Tory MP who told a friend in the coffee queue that \"the age of the totty here is much better than five years ago\". It would rasher still to hint at his surname. She merely hopes Mr X will be cured by the time he returns next year. And a very special hello to the Tory delegates who tried to lure the Backbencher into the Wessex Hotel on Monday with a chat-up line few women could resist: \"You're very well brought up!

But despite a growing reputation for unpunctuality, the MP has found time to post a few yelps from the fringe on his new weblog. \"Michael Howard is soaring like an eagle,\" the multi-tasker confides to his fans. (Not, absolutely not, like a bat.) \"Vicki Woods spoke in favour of recapturing the old vote - as well as recapturing the young. (Why not the whole caboodle, I asked myself?) and made some sensible points about getting more good-lookers in the shape of 30something ladies as potential MPs ... that could do wonders in making people wake up to politics again.\" And there we leave him, as ever, at the very cutting edge of the Conservatives' efforts to win back female voters - a suggestion only bested by the MEP Dan Hannan's observation that many \"ladies\" had been won over to the anti-EU constitution cause by the crackdown on herbal medicines.</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; TELLING IT LIKE IT ISN'T</b></p> <p>But, really, the final word goes to Dick Cheney in last night's vice-presidential ding-dong: \"I have not suggested there's a connection between Iraq and 9/11.\" Damn right you didn't suggest it, Dick.

  "The September 11 2001 attacks on the US represented such an unprecedented form of terrorism that the British government was forced to take strong action to protect its citizens, the attorney general told the House of Lords today. <p>Lord Goldsmith QC - representing the government in a case brought by nine foreign nationals currently being held without charge under emergency anti-terror laws - said the UK was under threat from Islamist extremists.</p> <p>The attorney general said the power to detain without trial, which meant the UK had to opt out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights, had been a response to the threat posed by a group of foreign nationals who had no immigration rights to be in the UK. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said the government would have been entitled to deport the men but, for the time being, could not do so because of concern over their human rights. He added that the men faced death or torture in their own countries and were seeking asylum in Britain.</p> <p>\"To protect the human rights of the millions of British residents and those whose human rights the government has a duty to protect, we took the view that, if these people cannot be deported, they should not be allowed to roam free on the streets, and so they had to be detained,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This was not a step taken lightly. The government believes it was a legitimate and appropriate response to protect the human rights of the suspected international terrorists by not exporting them to death and torture, and to protect the human rights of citizens here.\" </p> <p>The nine, who have been held for three years, are seeking a declaration from a panel of nine law lords that the UK's derogation (opting out) from article five of the convention on human rights, which guarantees liberty, was unlawful. </p> <p>The government took the step in order bring in the internment powers contained in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act shortly after the attacks on New York and Washington. </p> <p>In order to make the derogation lawful, the government must prove that a threat was posed by international terrorism to national security and the life of the nation. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said both the special immigration appeals commission, which reviewed the detainees' cases, and the court of appeal had come to the conclusion that the conditions for opting out had been met. </p> <p>He said the September 11 attacks were unmatched in their scale of human and physical destruction, with 65 Britons among the 3,000 victims, and demonstrated the extent of the threat against western democracies.</p> <p>\"These events required the government of this country to assess the threat to the UK and what measures it was necessary to take to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks of unparalleled magnitude,\" he added. </p> <p>The attorney general said discussions to assess that threat had taken place at the highest political level, and it was realised that the threat to the UK - as the closest ally of the US - was grave. It had increased when the UK joined the US in military action in Iraq, he added. </p> <p>\"Everyone in this country is relieved that there has not been an attack on the UK - but that is no indication that there is not a threat and may or may not be an indication of the effectiveness of the measures taken,\" he said. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said the threat to the UK had not diminished, adding it \"must be accepted that al-Qaida plans further attacks\". </p> <p>The test of whether there was a national emergency did not require the country to be on the brink of war or civil war or after a national disaster, he said. </p> <p>\"If one looks at the imminent threat of this new sort of terrorist attack, this is plainly an emergency threatening the life of the nation. The government was justified in taking the action that it did.\" The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is Parmalat alleged to have done?</strong><br> Parmalat, an Italian company specialising in long-life milk, is suspected of having perpetrated a massive fraud. Billions of euros have gone missing from its books in a scandal that has drawn parallels with the collapse of Enron, the US energy giant. </p> <p>The company has admitted that the true level of its debt is \u20ac14.3bn (\u00a310bn) - eight times more than it claimed. Italian prosecutors are trying to convince a judge to order trials for 29 people, ranging from Parmalat's founder to former financial officers, accountants and lawyers.</p> <p><strong>How did Parmalat's crisis start?</strong><br> The questions began in December 2003 when Parmalat had difficulty making a \u20ac150m bond payment. The company, which had 36,000 employees, was supposed to have been been sitting on \u20ac3.95bn in cash, so Italian bankers were puzzled by its predicament. Parmalat's founder, Calisto Tanzi, brushed bankers' concerns aside, saying the company had a bit of a liquidity problem.</p> <p><strong>How did the crisis escalate?</strong><br> Parmalat's problems quickly reached epic proportions after it made the extraordinary admission that the \u20ac3.9bn it thought it had in the bank did not exist. The money was supposedly in a Bank of America account held by Bonlat, a subsidiary based in the Cayman Islands. But Bank of America said there was no such account.</p> <p><strong>Where were the auditors?</strong><br> Parmalat's primary auditor was Deloitte &amp; Touche, but the Milan branch of Grant Thornton dealt with some of the company's subsidiaries, including Bonlat. When Grant Thornton checked with Bank of America, the auditor received a letter on Bank of America letterhead confirming the existence of the account. However, Bank of America said the letter was forged. </p> <p>The Italian units of Bank of America and Deloitte &amp; Touche are among the defendants prosecutors want put on trial, as is the former Italian affiliate of Grant Thornton, which the auditor has now got rid of. Two partners of that affiliate have been sent for trial in January. They are the first individuals to be prosecuted in the scandal.</p> <p><strong>Did the money exist in the first place?</strong><br> Investigators have been trying to find out. There are suspicions that company executives invented contracts that were shown to the banks in order to raise cash that was then used to cover up day-to-day losses. </p> <p>\"The money was there in the first place but it got lost along the way,\" a US analyst said. Some press reports say as much as \u20ac10bn has disappeared from the company's accounts. </p> <p><strong>Did anybody harbour suspicions about Parmalat?</strong><br> Some analysts did voice concern about Parmalat's rapid expansion. The company started as a peddler of prosciutto in a small northern Italian hamlet but grew into a dairy giant selling long-lasting milk and other milk products in 30 countries, and employing 36,000 people. The global expansion started with an acquisition in Brazil in the mid-1970s. </p> <p><strong>Did the expansion run into trouble?</strong><br> As the company grew, so did its debt. It was bailed out in 1990, with the Tanzi family giving up 49% of its control of the company. </p> <p>Parmalat returned to the acquisition trail a few years later and bought US food giant Beatrice Foods in 1997. Other deals followed, taking the company into China, Australia and Mexico. In the process, Parmalat's debts grew to \u20ac6bn, but investors kept buying the company's bonds on the strength of its supposed cash pile. But at least one analyst thought the bonds too risky, describing them as \"junk bonds in drag\" two years ago. </p> <p><strong>Who were the architects of Parmalat's growth?</strong><br> The company was founded by Calisto Tanzi, a university dropout who transformed a family business, Calisto Tanzi &amp; Sons - Salamis and Preserves into an organisation hailed as one of Europe's biggest corporate success stories. </p> <p>Along the way, he relied on Fausto Tonna, who was the company's finance director for 16 years. \"Tonna was a bit of a peasant in his manners but had an extremely sharp mind for finances,\" said a banker who met him. If anyone has the answers it will be Mr Tanzi and Mr Tonna, who have both stepped down. </p> <p><strong>What happens to Parmalat now?</strong><br> The company has sought protection from its creditors after the Italian government rushed through an emergency decree that would allow companies to apply to the industry ministry to appoint an administrator with immediate powers. </p> <p>Enrico Bondi was appointed special administrator of the company in December 2003. Mr Bondi won acclaim for handling the break-up of the Ferruzzi family's business empire, Italy's biggest corporate crisis of the 1990s. </p> <p><strong>Will Parmalat survive?</strong><br> Parmalat is now in administration, so it enjoys protection from its creditors. But at some point it will probably have to sell off many of the companies it has acquired over the years. Analysts say the company was quietly seeking to offload assets in Mexico, Brazil and the US up to two years ago in an attempt to reduce its debts, but it was asking prices nobody wanted to pay. </p> <p>It will be different now, with Parmalat in a much weaker bargaining position. Global players such as Nestl\u00e9 and Danone would be the most likely candidates to pick up some of the Parmalat pieces. Parmalat will probably survive, but in much shrunken form. </p> <p><strong>What financial impact will the scandal have?</strong><br> Shares in the company, which once had a market value of \u20ac1.8bn, are worthless, so millions of investors are out of pocket. Bank of America is thought to have provided between $150m (\u00a384m) and $250m in loans to Parmalat, but those are trivial sums for America's third biggest bank.</p>",
  "National polls conducted since the televised Bush-Kerry debate on September 30 showed a surge in support for the Democratic challenger, and this seems to have been reflected in surveys of the all-important swing states. <p>A <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/2004_Elections/OH041005xpreswsenv.pdf\">SurveyUSA poll</a> in Ohio yesterday - just hours ahead of the locally-filmed vice-presidential debate - found that John Kerry had bounced back from a four-point deficit. The poll said 49% of voters supported him, against 48% for George Bush. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the overall picture provided by pollster <a href=\"http://www.cookpolitical.com/races/report_pdfs/2004_electoral_college_oct4.pdf\">Charlie Cook</a> also showed a slight shift in Kerry's favour in the swing states.</p> <p>Cook sees Bush's total number of electoral votes - 270 are needed to win the electoral college - dropping slightly from 211 in September to 208 on October 3. Kerry's share has stayed the same - 207 - and with 123 electoral votes in 11 swing states up for grabs, the race appears to be wide open.</p> <p>The latest survey by <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=868\">John Zogby</a>, conducted on September 21, found that neither of the main candidates \"holds a clear-cut lead in enough states to win the electoral college votes required to capture the White House\".</p> <p>According to Zogby's monthly surveys, Bush has been trailing Kerry since July but has begun to close the gap. He now holds 241 electoral votes compared to Kerry's 264.</p> <p>This was all in stark contrast to a poll published in the <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/news/special_packages/election2004/polls/\"> Philadelphia Inquirer</a> 12 days before the presidential debate, which showed that Bush had opened up significant leads in 11 of the13 states that were most closely fought at the last election, including Ohio.</p> <p>According to the survey, compiled by Mason-Dixon, the president was leading in six of the swing states won by the Republicans at the last election and five of the seven Democrat-held swing states.</p> <p><b>Update on the situation in the swing-states</b></p> <p>Depending on which pollster you listen to, there are as many as 20 or as few as three battleground states. The candidates are particularly active in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, because these states have the most electoral votes to offer among the undecided bloc.</p> <p>The number of electoral votes a state receives is based on its population, making California the largest with 55 electoral votes. Seven states, and the District of Columbia, qualify for the minimum of three.</p> <p>The following twenty states have the closest races (electoral votes in parentheses):</p> <p>Bush won Arizona (10) fairly decisively in 2000, and an early-September poll by Market Solutions Group showed him to have what may be an unassailable lead: 54% to Kerry's 38%.</p> <p>Cook lists Arkansas (6) as a \"likely\" Bush win, but Zogby says it the state is \"too close to call\". The Kerry campaign has targeted Arkansas for its pre-election advertising spend.</p> <p>Colorado (9) voted for Bush in 2000 and leans towards him now, but Kerry has targeted the state for an advertising blitz during the final weeks of the campaign. Cook lists the state as a \"toss up\", but Zogby says the state has swung from Kerry to Bush over the last month.</p> <p>The biggest prize among the undecided states is Florida (27), which chose Bush in 2000 - with a little help from the supreme court - by the razor-thin margin of 527 votes.</p> <p>Iowa (7) went to Gore in 2000. By August 26, Gallup still had Kerry leading Bush by 51% to 45%. But last month, Mason-Dixon said Bush was in front with 48% against Kerry's 42%.</p> <p>Cook says Michigan (17) leans toward Kerry, and Gore won here last time. Mason-Dixon shows Kerry on a six point lead.</p> <p>Even with independent Ralph Nader taking 5% of the vote in 2000, Gore still won Minnesota (10). However, Bush could win here - polls show that neither he nor Kerry has a real lead.</p> <p>A Zogby poll from August 25 showed Missouri (11) and Nevada (5) being too close to call, but he now says they have both moved into the Bush camp. Cook also lists them as a probable Bush win.</p> <p>Bush just squeaked ahead in New Hampshire (4) at the last election, although the state may feel well disposed to a fellow New Englander in Kerry. For now, it remains too close to call.</p> <p>Gore won New Mexico (5) by a small margin in 2000, and the race for the state is still very close. Mason-Dixon's September poll has Bush and Kerry tied on 48%.</p> <p>North Carolina (15) leans toward Bush - but this is John Edwards' home state, and the Kerry campaign intends to spend heavily to turn things around.</p> <p>A Gallup poll taken in mid-August confirmed that Ohio (20) will be a key battleground state. The recent SurveyUSA poll (see above) gives Kerry a narrow lead.</p> <p>In 2000, Gore won Oregon (7) by a whisker, with 46.9% of the vote to Bush's 46.5%. Nader took a hefty 5%. Cook and Mason-Dixon say the state is leaning towards Kerry.</p> <p>Pennsylvania (21) went to Gore in 2000, but only just. The August 26 Gallup poll had Bush and Kerry neck and neck on 47%, with Nader at 2%, and 4% undecided.</p> <p>Cook says Tennessee (11) has gone from \"likely Bush\" to \"solid Bush in the last month, but Zogby feels it could still go either way. The Kerry campaign doesn't seem to be holding out much hope - it's not one of the 20 states where they have bought ad time.</p> <p>Bush will win Virginia (13), Cook believes, and Kerry has not pre-bought ad time in the state.</p> <p>Washington (11) will probably go to Kerry, says Cook, and the Republicans haven't won a presidential vote here since Ronald Reagan did so in 1984. Bush has been targeting the state, but Kerry has not been complacent, allocating money for late-campaign advertising.</p> <p>Democrats outnumber Republicans by two to one in West Virginia (5), but Bush took the state in 2000. Both Bush and Kerry campaigned here over the Labour Day holiday weekend, with polls showing the candidates running neck and neck.</p> <p>Wisconsin (10) went to Gore in 2000, but the September Mason-Dixon poll put Bush slightly ahead at 48%, with 46% preferring Kerry.</p>",
  "<p>Five is heading for a new storm over dumbed down reality TV shows after screening its most controversial broadcast yet in which David Beckham's alleged lover was shown masturbating a pig.</p> <p>Rebecca Loos, Beckham's former personal assistant, who gained notoriety earlier this year when she alleged she had conducted an affair with the England captain, carried out the procedure on Five's reality show, The Farm.</p> <p>Viewers were shown explicit footage of Loos, who donned rubber gloves to arouse the animal before collecting around a third of a litre of semen in a flask. The specimen was taken away and will be used to inseminate sows.</p> <p>Five said it was just a normal part of life on a farm, where animals have to be masturbated for breeding purposes.</p> <p>But viewers were critical. \"It was just vile. It was probably the worst thing I have seen on TV. I just couldn't believe it was on television,\" said one today.</p> <p>Another said: \"I was absolutely speechless.\"</p> <p>\"I couldn't watch it - it grossed me out,\" said a viewer who emailed the Digital Spy website. \"Are there not laws against this kind of thing?\" asked another.</p> <p>The 10-minute scene, watched by 1.6 million people, is the most controversial to appear on Five since a naked Keith Chegwin hosted a naturists' gameshow, Naked Jungle, four years ago. </p> <p>The quiz earned a stinging rebuke from then culture secretary, Chris Smith, who reminded Five bosses of their \"moral duty to take account of the views of the public\".</p> <p>Animal rights' pressure groups said last night's episode confirmed their worst fears about the show. </p> <p>\"The celebrities don't belong on this farm, the cameras don't belong on this farm and the TV crews don't belong on this farm,\" said Andrew Butler, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p> <p>\"It's a recipe for disaster. The programme-makers said the show would be about what life was like on the farm but the whole focus has been on the antics of the celebrities and who is yelling at whom. </p> <p>\"It doesn't help to see Vanilla Ice jumping on the back of a pig and riding it around or someone feeding croissants to ducks. If they want to do a series on what life is really like on a farm, then we are more than happy to help.\"</p> <p>A peak of 1.6 million viewers watched as Loos completed the task on last night's show - The Farm's highest audience to date. By mid-morning today, Five said it had received four complaints. Ofcom was still checking.</p> <p>The Farm, which is made by the Big Brother producer, Endemol, caused controversy even before it began last week, when Peta expressed concern that animals were being exploited for entertainment purposes.</p> <p>The tasks faced by the C-list celebrities on the show include \"dagging\" - cutting dried faeces from sheep's wool - and \"de-budding\" - removing nascent horns from cattle with red-hot pokers. </p> <p>Having completed her task, Loos told her fellow contestants: \"My arms are aching! It lasts for about 10 minutes and he starts thrusting really hard and then I grip!\" </p> <p>Fellow farm hand Debbie McGee told her: \"You must do it really well.\"</p> <p>Before the series began, Five's controller of features and entertainment, Ben Frow, said the aim of the show was to reflect \"real farm life. This is not about cheap titilation. The moment it becomes sleazy, it's doomed.\"</p> <p>Today Five insisted the decision to use Loos was not a publicity stunt and that she was chosen to conduct the procedure by vet Jon Huxley, not producers with a eye on the next day's press headlines.</p> <p>\"It is just a part of normal farm life,\" said a Five spokesman.</p> <p>\"The point of the show is to demonstrate the day-to-day workings of a farm to an audience who are not necessarily familiar with the nitty gritty of rural life. Rebecca Loos was trained and shown exactly what to do in advance and a vet was monitoring the entire process from start to finish.\"</p> <p>The series suffered an early blow when model Sophie Anderton dropped out and Paul Daniels quit after less than 72 hours. </p> <p>But the casting of US rapper Vanilla Ice - real name Robert van Winkle - could prove its saving grace. He had a furious bust-up with Daniels the night before the magician left and indulged in a furious four-letter tirade with Stan Collymore, which forced Five to cut the sound for an hour.</p> <p>The three-week series began with 1.1 million viewers and has grown steadily - if slowly - to achieve an average of 1.4 million last night, a 9% share of the audience in its 10pm slot. </p> <p>Five's first stab at a reality show, Back to Reality, began with 1.8 million in February but rapidly sank without trace. Station bosses will be pleased - if not exactly delighted - with the performance of The Farm so far.</p> <p>It is not the first time Five has shown semen being manually extracted from a farm animal. A pig was also featured on Five's late-night show Pub Ammo, hosted by Christian O'Connell. And its factual entertainment series 99 Things To Do Before You Die featured the hands-on presenter helping a horse fill a bag full of semen. </p> <p>The channel's entertainment chief, Andrew Newman, who has since left the station to join Channel 4, defended the scene. \"From what I can see,\" he said at the time, \"the horse certainly seemed to be enjoying it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Random drug testing of school pupils would be hugely increased as a part of a future Conservative government's crackdown on drug addiction, the shadow home secretary declared today.</p> <p>In a hardline \"war on drugs\" speech to the party faithful in Bournemouth, David Davis pledged to increase tenfold the number of drug rehabilitation places for addicted criminals - but also promised to \"support, encourage and accelerate\" David Blunkett's contentious scheme for testing schoolchildren.</p> <p>There was no detail in the speech on how the plan - which may be incompatible with the Human Rights Act - would be implemented, but Mr Davis went on to pledge that immigration would be a \"central issue\" at the next election.</p> <p>Mr Davis also made a direct connection between the IRA and the war on terrorism. He told delegates: \"We've been fighting [the war on terror] since before the phrase was invented.</p> <p>\"Twenty years ago in Brighton some dear friends died in that war.</p> <p>\"This new brand of terrorist, heartless and evil as they are, are no more representative of Islam than IRA terrorists were representative of Catholicism.\"</p> <p>He was most heavily applauded by grassroots activists for his pledge - briefed ahead of the speech - that the Tories would step up the \"war on drugs\".</p> <p>But he also cut away from his speech for a video from Nottingham shopkeeper Victor Bates, whose wife was killed by armed raiders. Since a man has been charged with that murder, the short film clip risked running foul of the law on contempt of court.</p> <p>Mr Davis made strong attacks on both the current home secretary and the Liberal Democrats. Citing the government's 37 acts of parliament, 160 initiatives and 350 new regulations, he claimed: \"This home secretary is more concerned about getting headlines than catching criminals.\"</p> <p>And claiming the Lib Dems would send joyriders on go-karting courses, he called their mantra of \"tough liberalism\" an \"oxymoron - with the emphasis on the last two syllables\".</p> <p>Mr Davis received another warm round of applause for criticising Mr Blunkett's plans for weekend prisons, saying: \"The trouble is, we don't have weekend criminals.\"</p> <p>Mr Davis vowed to keep tagging, but only \"in addition, not an alternative\" to prison.</p> <p>Citing Mr Howard's famous \"prison works\" mantra, he pledged to build more prisons, although again there was no detail on costs or numbers.</p> <p>He also promised to recruit an extra 5,000 police officers a year, but insisted they would be \"real police\" rather than the current boost in numbers of community support officers (CSOs).</p> <p>Echoing the Police Federation's criticisms, he dismissed CSOs as \"people who can't arrest anyone\".</p> <p>On immigration, which he left to the end, Mr Davis paid tribute to Britain's \"tradition of tolerance\" but insisted the Tories would bring in a fixed annual quota and overseas processing.</p> <p>\"It will be a central issue at the next election,\" he vowed, claiming that \"immigration alone could fill six new cities the size of Birmingham over the next three decades\".</p> <p>Calling Britain's current immigration levels \"too much, far too much\", he said the government's approach was \"clueless, chaotic and potentially catastrophic\".</p> <p>Mr Davis, a former leadership challenger on the right of the party, was interrupted repeatedly by applause from the gathered delegates - especially when he promised to end \"Labour's war on the motorist and the countryman\".</p> <p>Reacting to today's speech, drugs information charity DrugScope welcomed the promised expansion in residential treatment places, but attacked plans to increase random testing in schools.</p> <p>Martin Barnes, DrugScope's chief executive, said: \"To accuse the government of standing aside from the drug problem is surprising and inaccurate. Whilst we believe more should be done, we are in fact seeing record increases in funding to tackle drug misuse and provide treatment. </p> <p>\"We do not accept that random drug testing in schools is a proportionate or effective response to drug use among children and young people. Testing risks driving drug use underground, an increase in truancy and exclusions and a breakdown in trust between schools and pupils.</p> <p>Schools currently have the power to carry out drug tests, but an extensive process of consultation - with teachers, head teachers and schools drugs workers - showed strong opposition. Schools should be free to decide an appropriate response to drugs free from direct or indirect political pressure to test pupils.\"</p>",
  "As Conservatives we have a clear idea of what constitutes good government. <p>And the very first duty of government is to uphold the law and to make the citizens secure. </p> <p>Labour just can't grasp that. </p> <p>Their priorities are all wrong. </p> <p>They permit what shouldn't be legal; </p> <p>they ban what shouldn't be banned; </p> <p>and they allow hardened criminals to flourish. </p> <p>When it comes to controlling the honest citizen, they're enthusiastic for any and every means of control:</p> <p>speed cameras, ID cards, trials without juries - they love all that. </p> <p>But they won't build the prisons to keep criminals in and keep you safe.</p> <p>That's the difference between us and them. </p> <p>Conservative policies for law and order aren't about putting Big Brother in Charge. </p> <p>They're about putting the citizen in charge. </p> <p>But the citizen today is frightened, angry and restless. </p> <p>We shall act to change that, and only the Conservatives have the will or the guts to do it.</p> <p><b>Record in Government</b></p> <p>Today I want to talk about Labour's record on law and order.</p> <p>There's been lots of activity: 37 Acts of Parliament, 160 'initiatives'; and 350 new regulations. </p> <p>But where has it all led?</p> <p>Britain has a million hard drug addicts for the first time ever.</p> <p>A million violent crimes each year for the first time ever.</p> <p>And a million more unsolved crimes than when Labour took power. A million.</p> <p>Cocaine use up 3 times</p> <p>Sex offences up</p> <p>Gun crimes doubled </p> <p>Persistent youth offending up</p> <p>Street crime and drug crime out of control</p> <p>And an asylum and immigration system in chaos.</p> <p>And its no wonder when we have a home secretary more concerned about getting headlines than catching criminals.</p> <p><b>Liberal Democrats </b></p> <p>And we mustn't forget the Lib Dems. </p> <p>Did anyone watch their conference?</p> <p>I haven't enjoyed myself so much for a very long time.</p> <p>Their latest big idea on law and order was - </p> <p>wait for it - </p> <p>to send young joyriders go karting. </p> <p>And for car thieves, lessons in mechanics.</p> <p>Alton Towers for young offenders.</p> <p>Only a party that lives in Disneyland could dream that one up.</p> <p>At least we now know the truth about tough liberalism.</p> <p>It is an oxymoron - with the emphasis on the last two syllables.</p> <p><b>Drugs and violence</b></p> <p><b>Drugs</b></p> <p>Before turning to the police and prisons, I want to talk about an issue that is deadly and serious.</p> <p>A problem that tears at the bonds of families and of communities. </p> <p>A scourge that destroys respect and ruins lives. </p> <p>And increasingly the government stands aside from it. </p> <p>Drug abuse.</p> <p>I could give you a horrifying ream of statistics but they can never reveal the reality of how its victims suffer. </p> <p>Instead I want to tell you a story I read recently. </p> <p>It is a tragic story of a young girl, of her boyfriend and of their new-born baby daughter. </p> <p>The baby was just 5 days old when she died, poisoned by Heroin. </p> <p>She had never been held by either parent. </p> <p>Her father overdosed on drugs and died shortly after. </p> <p>Her mother's overdose didn't actually kill her. </p> <p>But it left her brain-damaged, lost in a coma. </p> <p>It's not just the appalling human tragedy that makes this story different. </p> <p>It was something else - the comments made by the Coroner. </p> <p>He asked: \"How can anyone listening to the cases today seriously advocate the use of drugs by young and immature people?\"</p> <p>Some people say that we've lost the war on drugs. </p> <p>I say we haven't begun to fight it.</p> <p>Fighting it will be my top priority.</p> <p>We will step up the battle against hard drugs. </p> <p>We've already pledged a ten-fold increase in the number of residential rehabilitation places - providing treatment for every young hard-drug addict in the country.</p> <p>Under the next Conservative Government addicts will face a choice: rehabilitation, or the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Residential rehabilitation is no soft option. </p> <p>It will be under court supervision - and failure will mean prison.</p> <p>This has worked in America, and with the right powers, it can work here too. </p> <p>The public is protected. </p> <p>The addict is encouraged to go straight - And stay straight. </p> <p>If nothing is done we will face a drugs epidemic, with terrible effects on our whole society. </p> <p>The Sun newspaper recently ran a survey on teenage behaviour. </p> <p>It found that nearly 100,000 children aged between 13 and 15 had used cocaine.</p> <p>That's enough children to fill 100 secondary schools. </p> <p>That's why we'll support, encourage and accelerate the implementation of random drug testing in schools. </p> <p>Children need to know that it is not cool to use drugs: it's stupid, it's illegal, and it's dangerous. </p> <p>I make no apology for taking a hard line on drugs. </p> <p>They destroy lives, destroy society and render all our efforts to reduce crime worthless.</p> <p><b>Violence</b></p> <p>The drug culture spawns the gun culture; and both help create the culture of violence.</p> <p>Today, parts of Britain are virtual no-go areas. </p> <p>Towns and cities - once peaceful - now overrun with gangs toting guns. </p> <p>And, in the middle, are decent, hard-working people whose lives are ruined - like someone I'm going to introduce to you now. </p> <p>Until recently, he was looking forward to seeing out his working life and then to a happy retirement with his wife. </p> <p>A year ago, all that changed.</p> <p>This video will upset us, but it should also make us angry. </p> <p>Angry for Victor Bates and the thousands like him whose lives have been ruined. </p> <p>Angry for the law-abiding majority who so often live in fear. </p> <p>And angry with this Labour Government for giving up the war on drugs, backing out of the fight against crime and showing weakness when they promised to be tough. </p> <p>[...] </p> <p>I would like to make a promise to you and to Victor. </p> <p>I cannot pledge that such horrors will never occur under a Conservative Government. </p> <p>But I can and I do promise that we will never give up on the war against crime and the war against drugs.</p> <p><b>Police performance</b></p> <p>Today thousands of our fellow countrymen are afraid - </p> <p>afraid to stay in their homes, afraid to leave them; </p> <p>afraid to summon help, afraid not to; </p> <p>afraid to barricade their doors, afraid to be trapped behind them. </p> <p>But in Conservative Britain I want the criminals to be afraid - </p> <p>afraid of being caught and afraid of being punished. </p> <p>There's a simple reason why Rudi Guiliani made New York a safer City than London.</p> <p>Why Ray Mallon has cut crime time and again in Middlesbrough.</p> <p>It's because they decided not to tolerate crime any more.</p> <p>They were locally elected officials who listened to the people and gave them what they wanted. </p> <p>Zero tolerance of crime. Zero tolerance of failure to act on crime.</p> <p>We'll give people the right to choose who will run their local police force. </p> <p>And to determine the priorities they want their police to follow. </p> <p>But zero tolerance policing demands more police. </p> <p>A lot more police. </p> <p>And I mean real police. </p> <p>This Government has responded by recruiting 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone. </p> <p>We will respond by recruiting 40,000 police officers who can.</p> <p>And we have to ensure that those police, like all our police, are used properly. </p> <p>They mustn't be diverted to tasks determined by political correctness. </p> <p>They mustn't be employed to carry out by proxy the Labour Party's war against the motorist or the countryman. </p> <p>And they mustn't be impeded by the deadweight of regulation that this Labour Government has imposed. </p> <p>Our alternative is clear: the next Conservative government will set the police free to cut crime.</p> <p>There will be no more national targets, no more ring-fenced funding, Whitehall priorities.</p> <p>Just good, traditional policing. </p> <p>Deterring crime and catching criminals. </p> <p>That's what the public wants.</p> <p><b>Prisons</b></p> <p>Catching criminals is no good if you don't punish them.</p> <p>But Britain's prisons are already full.</p> <p>The Home Office predicts a prison population of around 100,000 at the end of the decade - but are only planning spaces for 80,000. </p> <p>As a result of this failure of planning we'll now see every underhand device possible to let people out of prison early or prevent them from being sent there in the first place.</p> <p>David Blunkett's latest idea is weekend prison. </p> <p>The trouble is, of course, that we don't have weekend criminals. </p> <p>They're at it all day, all week, all the year round. </p> <p>That's why they need to be locked up - all day, all week, all the year round.</p> <p>Prison does work. </p> <p>It is a deterrent. </p> <p>Criminals fear it.</p> <p>And it takes criminals out of circulation - while they are locked up, they cannot commit crimes.</p> <p>Half of all crimes in Britain are committed by the same 100,000 persistent criminals.</p> <p>But at any one time, just 15,000 of these are actually in jail. </p> <p>Leaving 85,000 serious criminals out roaming your streets, out burgling your homes, out robbing your friends.</p> <p>But rather than build more prisons, this Government have been letting prisoners out early. Tagged.</p> <p>As Michael Howard told you yesterday, this means 3,600 unnecessary crimes; 3,600 unnecessary victims.</p> <p>Electronic tagging has its place. </p> <p>But a prison without bars is not a prison. </p> <p>Tagging should be used as an addition to prison, not as an alternative.</p> <p>Our policy is not to lock people up and throw away the key. </p> <p>It's important for them and society that they come out better not worse than they went in. </p> <p>And they can sometimes reform, if we get the framework and the programmes right.</p> <p>But one thing is clear: if prisons are overcrowded, prisoners are just shuffled around the system to make room, and they end up never finishing a retraining course. </p> <p>So they end up on the street, without skills, unable to read, often addicted to drugs, with no prospect of work. </p> <p>And they go straight back to crime. </p> <p>The Conservative programme of prison building and our drug rehabilitation programme gives us an opportunity to cut the vicious cycle of re-offending.</p> <p>Our criminal justice system is in crisis.</p> <p>We will solve this crisis.</p> <p>By scrapping Labour's early release scheme; </p> <p>By increasing the proportion of the prison budget that is spent on education and rehabilitation; </p> <p>And by starting a prison building programme that will allow judges to send prisoners down for the sentence they deserve. </p> <p>A sentence designed to fit the crime, not the number of prison cells available.</p> <p>We'll start this in the first month and complete it in the first term of a Conservative Government.</p> <p>We will make Britain more secure and bring down crime. </p> <p>It can be done.</p> <p>It must be done.</p> <p>It will be done.</p> <p><b>Immigration</b></p> <p>As Michael Howard reminded us yesterday, the Home Secretary says he sees no \"obvious limit\" to legal immigration. </p> <p>And as for the number of illegal immigrants already here: well he confesses he \"hasn't a clue\".</p> <p>Clueless, chaotic and potentially catastrophic - three words summing up this Government's immigration policy.</p> <p>Since Labour came to power, immigration has soared. </p> <p>It is running at three times its previous level - and that's not counting illegal immigrants.</p> <p>Immigration alone could fill six new cities the size of Birmingham over the next three decades. </p> <p>The Government says that it doesn't know if this level of immigration is too much or too little. </p> <p>Well let me tell them. It is too much, far too much, and we must do something about it.</p> <p>Let me make it clear, we will never diminish the contribution that immigrants make: </p> <p>we welcome and we value it. </p> <p>Britain is better for all the immigrants over the centuries who have worked hard to make this their home. </p> <p>But respect for past immigrants doesn't mean backing away from our duty now. </p> <p>But Britain is already the most densely populated major country in Europe. </p> <p>And the immigration we receive isn't evenly distributed - it goes to our most overcrowded areas. </p> <p>It puts a burden on housing, health, schools and other public services, and it does so where that burden is already heaviest to bear.</p> <p>A Conservative government will substantially cut immigration into Britain.</p> <p>Uncontrolled immigration endangers the values that we in Britain rightly treasure. </p> <p>We Conservatives understand how vital it is not to threaten what makes this country so tolerant, so decent, so respectful of other people's rights - and, yes, so welcoming of people who come here. </p> <p>Extremist political parties are hoping to batten on the fears and resentments that already exist. </p> <p>So the next Conservative Government will act. </p> <p>We will tightly control immigration because the country requires it.</p> <p>I don't blame people for wanting to come to Britain to find a better life. </p> <p>What I blame is the system that lures them - and then leaves them - here. </p> <p>The shabby trade in illegal immigration is run by criminals; and those who work illegally in Britain easily become their victims. </p> <p>For that reason too, we must act to secure the future - including the future of our settled immigrant populations - before it is too late.</p> <p>And we will act in several ways.</p> <p>We will curb illegal immigration by re-introducing embarkation controls - physically checking people in, and physically checking them out again. </p> <p>We will also push ahead with reforms to our asylum system, with a system of overseas processing.</p> <p>We will reform the system of work permits, which is currently being abused.</p> <p>Above all, we shall lay down a clear annual limit to the level of total immigration. </p> <p>And we'll see it isn't breached.</p> <p>This will reassure people about their future. </p> <p>And it will sweep away, once and for all, the web of distortion and deceit that poisons this debate.</p> <p>I make no apologies for talking about immigration. </p> <p>It is an issue of real public concern.</p> <p>It will be a central issue at the next election. </p> <p>And have no doubt: if the legitimate parties don't discuss it, the real danger is that extremists will. </p> <p>We will not give them that opportunity.</p> <p><b>Terrorism</b></p> <p>Efficient immigration controls are a crucial part of the war against terror.</p> <p>The Conservative Party will never flinch in that war. </p> <p>We've been fighting it since before the phrase was invented. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, in Brighton some dear friends died in that war. </p> <p>We shall never forget them.</p> <p>We treat terrorism seriously. </p> <p>The terrorist threat is more important than party advantage. </p> <p>And today that threat is greater than it has ever been.</p> <p>So I support much of what the Government has done to deal with terrorism. </p> <p>I shall continue to do so.</p> <p>But I will remind the Home Secretary of this - he is not just protecting our lives, he is protecting our way of life - and that includes our ancient British liberties: the presumption of innocence, the right to trial by jury, habeas corpus. </p> <p>And he should not erode these unless he has exhausted every other possibility.</p> <p>And we should remember this. </p> <p>This new brand of terrorist, heartless and evil as they are, are no more representative of Islam than IRA terrorists were representative of Catholicism. </p> <p>We are fortunate in having many good, moderate Muslim leaders in this country, who espouse and promote peace. </p> <p>I salute their courage. </p> <p>The terrorists are as much of a threat to them as they are to the rest of us.</p> <p>But those who abuse our open society, our free press, our tolerance, to foment hatred and divisions, to promote vicious doctrines and give encouragement to terrorists - against those we should deploy the full arsenal of our law and our forces.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>Try it on</p> <p>People today often bemoan what's happened to society. </p> <p>The disorder, the general lack of respect and civility. </p> <p>What government can do about it is limited. </p> <p>Yet government should help not hinder. </p> <p>It can introduce good laws and ensure they're enforced by effective policing. </p> <p>It can provide the resources to keep dangerous men locked up, not preying on our neighbourhoods. </p> <p>It can control the country's borders, and it can keep out or throw out those who wish our nation ill. </p> <p>On all these things, this Labour Government is failing - and its failure is dragging our whole society down.</p> <p>In Britain today, there's a silent struggle. </p> <p>It's between the decent, respectable, law abiding citizen, who wants to look after his own, and pay his dues, and get on with his life. </p> <p>And on the other side there's a noisy minority that cares nothing for anyone - people who respect only force. </p> <p>How do you think that predatory minority feels now? </p> <p>What signals do you think they get from our criminal justice system today? </p> <p>I'll tell you the message that goes out: Fancy committing a crime? </p> <p>Go on, try it. Under Labour you're not likely to get caught. </p> <p>Want to move to Britain but can't be bothered to go through the proper channels? </p> <p>Go on, try it. Come and claim asylum that you don't deserve. Under Labour there's only a one in five chance of being sent home.</p> <p>Fancy selling alcohol to minors, mugging an old lady, nicking something from the shops, dealing drugs, or spray-painting your name all over the place? </p> <p>Well, go ahead - try it. Under Labour out of 100 crimes committed, only 3 result in a conviction. </p> <p>In Tony Blair's Britain, more and more people see the decent majority as another soft touch. </p> <p>They're bending the rules; they're trying it on; they're flouting the law. </p> <p>That's the reality of Britain under Labour - and it's time to bring it to an end. </p> <p>It's time to regain control, end political correctness, cut red tape, enforce the law and send a clear and consistent message - we're not going to be pushed around any more. </p> <p>We need a change of culture. A return to the values of decency, discipline and respect. </p> <p>For that we need a change of Government. </p> <p>One that doesn't just talk tough, but one that is tough. </p> <p>A Conservative Government.</p>",
  "Addicts who turn to crime to feed their habit will face a choice of jail or rehabilitation under a 10-fold expansion of drug treatment programmes, the Conservatives will announce today. <p>David Davis, the shadow home secretary, will unveil a \"timetable for action\" at the Tories' key law and order debate in Bournemouth today.</p> <p>He is to pledge that the country \"hasn't even begun\" fighting the \"war on drugs\" yet. More controversially, he will announce a massive expansion of random drug testing for school pupils.</p> <p>Crime and law and order are traditionally perceived as Tory trump cards in election campaigning, although David Blunkett's hardline stance as home secretary has seen the divide between the parties narrow.</p> <p>Many delegates on the fringe this week have expressed doubts about the government's \u00a33bn scheme to introduce ID cards, so any word on that in Mr Davis's speech will be eagerly awaited.</p> <p>Since shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin's spending plans include no extra money for the Home Office, Mr Davis is expected to propose paying for an extra 5,000 police officers a year by diverting savings planned for the immigration and nationality departments.</p> <p>Yesterday Michael Howard pledged a \"war on crime\" based on the zero-tolerance policies of former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Middlesbrough \"Robocop\" Ray Mallon. </p> <p>Today, Mr Davis is due to say: \"Some people say that we've lost the war on drugs. I say we haven't begun to fight it. Fighting it will be my top priority.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis will insist that offering addicts the choice of undergoing rehabilitation to escape prison was \"no soft option\". </p> <p>\"It will mean court supervision, and failure will mean prison. This has worked in America and with the right powers it can work here.</p> <p>\"The public is protected. The addict is encouraged to go straight - and stay straight. </p> <p>\"If nothing is done, we will face a drugs epidemic, with terrible effects on our whole society.\" </p> <p>A recent survey suggested that as many as 100,000 children aged 13 to 15 in the UK had used cocaine, Mr Davis will say, adding: \"That's why we will support, encourage and accelerate the implementation of random drug-testing of pupils.\"</p> <p>He will add: \"Children need to know that it is not cool to use drugs - it's stupid, it's dangerous, it's illegal.</p> <p>\"And parents should know that the law will be enforced. </p> <p>\"I make no apology for taking a hard line on drugs. They destroy lives, destroy society and render all our efforts to reduce crime worthless.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis will also confirm plans to scrap Labour's early release scheme for prisoners and slim down form-filling by police officers. </p> <p>Mr Davis told BBC1's Breakfast programme: \"The policing budget in the first four years primarily comes from the savings we are going to make on the immigration and nationality department. </p> <p>\"What has happened since this government has been in power is that the cost of that department has gone from \u00a3280m in the first year up to \u00a31,820m - six times up. We are not going to get it right back to \u00a3280m, but we will get it back roughly to half over a couple of years. </p> <p>\"The prison-building will come as a result of the major savings programme that Oliver has been talking about across Whitehall. The drugs funding will come in the health budget.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis acknowledged that it would take time to create extra prison places. But he said that the additional pressure on space created by his immediate abolition of the early release scheme would be eased by the diversion of young drug offenders from prison to rehabilitation programmes.</p> <p>He also pledged a future Tory government would end the \"target culture\" and free up \"bottlenecks\" in the criminal justice system. </p> <p>He denied this contradicted Mr Howard's \"timetable for action\", stressing that Tories would free police from the \"paperwork mountain\". </p> <p>\"The problem that we have at the moment is the whole system is under pressure because you have got bottlenecks all along it, from the police right through to the prisons,\" he told Today. </p> <p>Mr Davis also attacked the early release scheme, stressing that electronic tagging must be used in conjunction with prison sentences. </p> <p>\"Roughly half the crime in the country is carried out by about 100,000 persistent criminals. At any point in time only 15,000 of them are in jail, which means you've got 85,000 on the streets robbing you, robbing me, carrying on putting the crime rate up. </p> <p>\"That's why you need more prison cells,\" he said.</p>",

  "Police in northern Spain today arrested five suspected members of the Basque separatist group Eta as they awaited orders to stage an attack, the interior ministry said. <p>The four men and one woman were seized in raids in San Sebastian and Irun, both in the Basque country, and in Pamplona in neighbouring Navarra.</p> <p>An interior ministry official said the arrests were made possible by information from a Spanish truck driver seized on Sunday in northern Spain as part of a cross-border operation that also resulted in the capture in south-west France of 20 Eta suspects. </p> <p>Eta's alleged leader, known by his alias, Mikel Antza, was said to be among those held in Sunday's operation - seen as the worst setback for the group in more than a decade.</p> <p>Rocket launchers, rifles, munitions and explosives were reportedly found in villages and farmhouses between Pau and Bayonne in south-west France.</p> <p>Forty-two machine pistols were said to have been discovered at one spot and quantities of Eta's favoured explosive, Titadyne, were also found. </p> <p>French police also seized a large weapons cache that they said included two surface-to-air missiles.</p> <p>According to reports in the Spanish press today, the Russian-made missiles, still in their cardboard boxes and with instructions attached, had been sold to Eta by Irish weapons smugglers with possible links to the IRA.</p> <p>The missiles were transported from Ireland about four years ago, la Vanguardia newspaper said, quoting anonymous anti-terrorist sources in the Basque region.</p>",
  "Tony Blair will today fly to the Sudan to warn the Khartoum government that it must act swiftly to end the atrocities and refugee crisis in its western region of Darfur, mainly by allowing as many as 5,000 African Union peacekeeping troops free movement into the region this month. <p>The visit is a sign of Mr Blair's personal commitment to end \"the worst humanitarian crisis in Africa since Rwanda\", but carries big political risks if indifference within the international community means the refugees continue to be attacked with impunity. </p> <p>Mr Blair, the first serving British prime minister to visit an independent Sudan, will meet the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, this morning in Khartoum.</p> <p>The prime minister's hand is strengthened by the threat of UN-imposed sanctions still hanging over the Arab-dominated Sudanese government. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, reported yesterday that Khartoum had made no progress in the past month in meeting the terms of two UN security council resolutions passed earlier this year.</p> <p>Aid agencies, notably Oxfam, speaking from Darfur yesterday warned that \"beatings and rapes were continuing on a daily basis\", and urged Mr Blair to extract specific assurances about an expanded mandate for the African Union troops due to protect the refugees and aid agencies. </p> <p>There have been calls for Britain to provide logistical support to the AU troops, but there is no plan for largescale British military involvement.</p> <p>Mr Blair can also offer the carrot of further EU and British aid if the Sudanese government negotiates a comprehensive peace deal due to be discussed with the main rebel groups later this month.</p> <p>The international community has been accused of acting too late to prevent what the US government has called the genocide of black Africans by the Arab government.</p> <p>Mr Bashir, a former host of Osama bin Laden, seized power in a coup in 1989 and has spent nearly 20 years suppressing an independence movement in the south of the country. He insists he has no control over the militias in the Darfur region, describing them as outlaws, and saying his police have done everything possible to secure general disarmament. Few at the UN accept his denials of responsibility.</p> <p>Drastic oil sanctions against Sudan have so far been averted by the threat of a UN veto by China, and the Khartoum government's as yet untested acceptance of as many as 5,000 Africa Union troops into the country to monitor the ceasefire and ensure safe passage for aid workers. At present, there are fewer than 300 AU troops in Darfur, an impoverished region larger than France, and their chief mandate is to protect 60 ceasefire monitors.</p> <p>The aid agencies said yesterday they were concerned that the British government was misleading itself into believing the humanitarian crisis was easing at a time when 1.4 million refugees remained in camps running out of fresh water and shelter. Mr Blair's spokesman said that there had been an improvement in the supply of humanitarian aid in urban, but not rural areas, partly due to UN pressure.</p> <p>Reports suggest that Sudanese government-supported militias, mainly the Janjaweed, have killed as many as 50,000 non-Arabs in a campaign of ethnic cleansing - acts condemned by the US government as genocide, which implies an organised government intent to commit mass murder. Britain says it will await the result of a UN-sponsored commission of inquiry before deciding whether Mr Bashir's government is directly responsible for the deaths.</p> <p>Speaking from Nyala in the south of Darfur, Oxfam aid worker Adrian McIntyre said: \"People in the camps are still suffering from daily violence nearly six months after a ceasefire, including rapes, beatings and humiliations such as cutting women's hair.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair is likely to urge Mr Bashir to look for a long-term political solution. But the prime minister, in the region for a two-day meeting of his commission for Africa, will meet stiff opposition since prominent Sudanese officials earlier this week ruled out any notion of self-rule for Darfur.</p> <p>The agriculture minister, Majzoub al-Khalifa, head of the government's Darfur peace talks delegation, questioned whether Khartoum would even continue negotiating with one of the rebel groups in the talks scheduled to resume later this month.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Howard yesterday gave Conservatives a clear reminder of why they were right to get rid of Iain Duncan Smith as their leader. Mr Duncan Smith's nasty and ill-judged party conference speech in Blackpool a year ago was another reminder of how difficult it has been for successive Tory leaders, from John Major onwards, to find an effective rhetorical alternative to Tony Blair. Mr Howard had clearly given a lot of thought to that problem. His answer was an intelligent one: to avoid grandiloquence, to adopt a more explicatory tone, to make his story more personal (resulting in some particularly effective passages) and, above all, to offer himself as an alternative kind of politician, a man with his feet on the ground not his head in the clouds, as Lord Saatchi put it yesterday. </p> <p>As far as it goes, this is an attractive strategy. We badly need a more truthful and accountable form of politics. But Mr Howard also gave his party a reminder of why he has not solved many of their more basic problems. An opposition party that is in danger of losing a third successive election needs to fire up its supporters, not to dampen them down; so, while Mr Howard can be commended for not opting for negative attacks, he can also be criticised for not giving his party clear lines on which to campaign against Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who were barely mentioned in the speech. </p> <p>It was also bad luck for Mr Howard that the evangelical Blair style against which his speech was so self-consciously constructed was also rather conspicuously abandoned by the prime minister in Brighton; Mr Howard, in other words, may be attacking a diminishing target. But the biggest problem was simply this: Mr Howard is an old-style politician to his finger-tips. For this most barristerial of all politicians to pose as an \"anti-politician\" is inherently implausible. </p> <p>The chief criticism of his speech was not its style but its substance. The list of subjects which the Tory leader failed to address was a long one. It included the economy and the business agenda - an almost incredible omission by a Tory leader in the run-up to an election - the environment, constitutional reform (Europe inevitably excepted), and the great traditional Tory rallying-cry of individual freedom. In the video shown to delegates before Mr Howard's entrance, freedom was a central theme (to the stirring accompaniment of Elgar's Nimrod); in his speech, he had almost nothing to say about it. And he bottled out of saying that the imperative to obey the law extends to the law on hunting with dogs. </p> <p>The speech was stronger on cliches than on firm pledges. The Tory leader tried to give the impression that a Howard government would spring instantly into life with an all-action agenda, but the commitments were few and general. Mr Howard said almost nothing of substance on health, education and pensions, beyond people being entitled to choice. The section on tax was deliberately opaque. The most settled prospectus was his old Home Office specialities of crime and immigration. </p> <p>The most striking and most carefully constructed part was on Europe. Here the pledges suddenly got more specific - a referendum on the EU constitution by September 2005, withdrawal from the social chapter, from the common fisheries policy and from EU overseas aid programmes. The delegates responded fervently - a sign of the Tory party's undiminished grassroots Europhobia. The big question in the conference corridors remains whether such pledges are enough to blunt the challenge of the UK Independence party. Mr Howard seems to have struck a dirty deal with John Redwood to persuade the businessman Paul Sykes to stop bankrolling Ukip. From a man who says he wants to give it to us straight, this seems very much like old politics as usual.</p>",
  "Michael Howard yesterday ratcheted up the Conservative campaign against European integration when he promised to set an early date for a referendum on the EU constitution on the first day of his premiership - and to \"go further\" in pulling back powers from Brussels. <p>On the day that the UK Independence party, his rival for Eurosceptic votes, saw its main financial backer return to the Tory fold, Mr Howard made no attempt to disguise his determination to thwart Ukip's boast that it is poised to \"kill\" the Tories. \"Come and join us,\" he told defectors. </p> <p>Promoting his \"pick and mix\" policy for allowing EU member states to integrate or not, as they wish, Mr Howard said yesterday that rapidly saying no to a written constitution and later to the euro would not be enough. </p> <p>\"It's time we went further\" by repatriating the social chapter, the EU fishing policy and other powers, he said. </p> <p>Pro-Europeans and unions expressed dismay at what they regard as pandering to the Ukip menace, despite the internal Ukip bickering triggered by millionaire Paul Sykes's move back to the Tories. It saw Robert Kilroy-Silk MEP, Ukip's new star, being told to become \"a team player\" by his leader, Roger Knapman. </p> <p>The Conservative leader used his first keynote conference speech to offer a package of tough and immediate steps to address voters' concerns on crime, drugs, dirty hospitals, immigration control and lower taxes in ways he hopes will lower public cynicism towards politics. </p> <p>To further demonstrate that the Tories are back in touch with the domestic concerns of the electorate, Mr Howard eschewed visionary rhetoric or goals in favour of 10 notably down-to-earth words he wants his canvassers to offer disaffected Labour voters when the expected May 2005 election is called. </p> <p>They are: \"School discipline, more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, controlled immigration,\" and will be underpinned by the recurring word in Mr Howard's speech of abject apology for the failings of the political class - \"accountability\". </p> <p>In a series of policy promises which a Howard cabinet will be expected to deliver in days, weeks and months of taking office - or face the sack - Mr Howard told conference: \"On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the constitution. </p> <p>\"So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. Europe isn't working properly today and the constitution will only make matters worse.\" </p> <p>The \"day one\" emphasis reflects the Howard team's belief that \"Tony Blair has been all talk\" and windy rhetoric, and that voters now want action. To show what they can do in the first month of power the Tories will set out a full \"timetable for action\" when their conference closes tomorrow. </p> <p>Mr Howard's 48-minute speech reflected both his low-key style and a conscious desire not to make sustained personalised attacks on Tony Blair or Charles Kennedy, though Mr Blair was again accused on \"not telling the truth\" over the Iraq war and of betrayal over 66 \"stealth tax\" rises. </p> <p>\"Everyone's been let down by Labour on tax,\" he said. \"If Labour were to win again, we'd have Blair's third term tax rises.\" </p> <p>But he avoided specific tax promises until after the Tories have seen their own savings plans and Gordon Brown's next budget.</p> <p>\"When I can, I will cut taxes... taxes I want to make fairer, simpler, lower. But I'm not like Tony Blair. I'm not going to make promises I can't keep... we must be honest with the British people. It's that word again, accountability,\" Mr Howard said.</p> <p>Privately, Mr Howard is frustrated that his key messages are not getting through, including more choice in schools and healthcare, more school expulsions and police on the beat and, within his first month, an annual limit on immigration.</p> <p>Mr Howard shares the view of young allies like David Cameron that \"the biggest problem in British politics today is cynicism, apathy and disillusion\".</p> <p>Labour was quick to contrast yesterday's words with the former Tory home secretary's record in reducing police numbers, asylum chaos and rises in some categories of crime.</p>",
  "Michael Howard told his party yesterday: \"When people ask you on the doorstep, 'I can't stand Tony Blair, but why should I vote for you lot?' here are 10 words to remember - school discipline, more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, controlled immigration. Ten words to address the problems that are worrying people today. Remember those words.\" <p>But did they?</p> <p><b> Nicholas Soames</b>, the shadow defence secretary, admitted to the Guardian yesterday: \"Yes... I can, I'm just trying to think back. I heard them before lunch. Crime, dealing with crime. Schools, education... I cannot remember the others.\" </p> <p><b> Sir Paul Beresford</b>, MP for Mole Valley said: \"I could remember them an hour ago but whether I could now is very doubtful - but I will be going home and writing them down.\" </p> <p><b> Vanessa Gearson</b>, Cheltenham candidate Vanessa and a former Tory chief of staff: \"Of course I remember them but I am not going to answer the next question which is what are they! School discipline, lower taxes, erm, control on asylum and immigration... school discipline, lower taxes, control on asylum and immigration...\" </p> <p><b> Sir Patrick Cormack</b>, Staffordshire South MP, commented: \"Well, yes, I think he talked about discipline in schools. He talked about clean hospitals. He talked about policing and more police and, err, what else was it? He took them from an article I wrote in the House magazine conference issue... Lower tax. I got eight out of 10, that's not bad.\"</p> <p><b> Lord Brooke</b>, former Conservative MP, said: \"I might be able to do it backwards - immigration control or controlled immigration, better schools, lower taxes, cleaner hospitals and I have to get one more. Hold on, hold on... there is a friend I have to talk to. Try me later.\"</p> <p><b> John Maples</b>, Howard adviser and Stafford-on-Avon MP, told the Guardian: \"School discipline, clean hospitals, limited immigration or something like that. That's three. Something about the European constitution, no European constitution? More police. I got eight out of 10.\"</p> <p><b> Stephan Shakespeare</b>, pollster and a former aide to Jeffrey Archer: \"I wasn't there for the speech.

  "<p>Steve sits quietly in the corner, his anorak pulled up tightly to his face, while the other boys talk about being \"jacked\" for their mobile phones and \"rushed\" by groups of rival youths. </p> <p>\"Someone pulled a knife on me yesterday,\" says Ali, 15, nonchalantly. \"I told him: 'Come on then, stab me.' I knew he didn't want to do it. He was shaking. He walked off.\" </p> <p>Robert Levy, 16, wasn't so lucky: he was stabbed to death last month as he tried to break up a fight between his friend and other youths on his way home from school in east London; nor was Ashley Hedger, 16, found dead in January with a six-inch blade embedded in his head, in nearby Upton Park, after being wrongly accused of robbery. </p> <p>Although there are no figures on how many young people carry knives, an internal study by the Metropolitan Police has found that more than 6,600 reported crimes in London in the year up to May 2004 involved a knife - an 18% rise on the previous year. What's more, 80% were carried out by offenders aged between 12 and 20. </p> <p>Commander Simon Foy, head of the Met's anti-knife crime campaign, Operation Blunt, says: \"It is hugely significant that this is a crime predominately affecting young people. It is becoming more fashionable for them to carry knives.\" </p> <p>Operation Blunt was launched this summer in Southwark, Hammersmith and Fulham, and in leafy Sutton - to emphasise that this is not just an inner-city problem. It is testing different methods to cut knife crime. Sending police officers into secondary schools to warn pupils they face arrest for possessing a knife is one way; others are knife amnesties, or deploying a scanner that can see through people's clothes to detect hidden weapons. </p> <p>What it fails to address is the reasons young people give for being \"tooled up\". Steve, aged 13, took a locking knife with a three-inch-blade to school. \"I was scared,\" he whispers. What the teenager, now aged 17, means is that he was bullied. Ashamed that he was unable to stand up to his tormentors, he says, he felt the need to carry a knife. Although he never even got it out of his pocket, he says it made him feel safer. </p> <p>Steve's weapon, brought from an Army and Navy surplus shop, now lies in a tool box along with an assortment of kitchen knives and flick knives, screwdrivers, an ice pick and a meat cleaver - all pulled out of pockets and handed in at the end of a weapons awareness course taught by Be Safe personal safety consultancy. </p> <p>The course's own shock weapon is a book of photos that show in graphic detail the horror of knife wounds. The youths I am speaking to flinch at images of a torso with intestines hanging out, a knife in a neck, blood oozing from a gash in a leg. \"They're grotty, sick and nasty,\" says Shane, pushing his chair away. Although he has seen them before on the course, his reaction is still one of palpable disgust. Kevin Everard, Be Safe's chief instructor, explains that such a reaction is common, particularly among those who carry knives, because they realise it could happen to them. </p> <p>A report out today warns that, despite the spate of fatal stabbings in London, there is little of this type of education for young people. Fear and Fashion, commissioned by the Bridge House Trust, the grant-giving arm of the Corporation of London, uncovers just a few examples of agencies trying to tackle the problem. \"We hear about kids brandishing knives at school and youth clubs when there is a stabbing and it becomes a criminal issue, but no one is tackling the issue head on,\" says Clare Thomas, Bridge House Trust's chief grants officer. </p> <p>Amid clamour from police chiefs for longer jail terms for knife crime, the trust plans to fund educational programmes that deter young people from committing, or becoming a victim of, such a crime. To date, only two of the 68 grants from its \u00a33.5m children and young people funding stream have gone to fund this type of work in a few secondary schools. \"No one feels that this is their responsibility,\" says Thomas. </p> <p>One barrier is schools' reluctance to acknowledge that their pupils might carry weapons. In a 2003 Mori survey for the Youth Justice Board, 29% of secondary school children admitted they had carried a knife. </p> <p>Some schools plans to install metal detectors at school entrances. But there are concerns that this will simply drive the problem on to the streets: 62% of excluded pupils surveyed by Mori admit to carrying a knife. In five years, Be Safe has been invited into only 12 secondary schools in London. </p> <p>John Birkenshaw, crime reduction manager for Leeds Community Safety, a joint initiative by the council and West Yorkshire Police, is hopeful that his city's schools will be more cooperative. He has asked Be Safe to train 120 local instructors to deliver their one-hour weapons awareness programme to Year 7 (11-12 year old) pupils. \"We're concerned that carrying knives is a growing culture, and we want to address it head on,\" says Birkenshaw, a retired policeman. </p> <p>But how do you evaluate the success of weapons awareness programmes? When Everard first met Steve, he says he didn't think he'd make it to 17. \"He was close to using his knife or being killed by one. I thought he'd top himself if he got into the criminal justice system. Now, he's at college studying mechanics and has a girlfriend. That's success.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The report, Use of Knives and Weapons by Young People, is at <a href=\"http://www.bridgehousetrust.org.uk \">www.bridgehousetrust.org.uk </a></p>",
  "Women who come from abroad to sell sex, who sit in flats and massage parlours bored stiff when business is slow, don't make good headlines - or good drama. Trafficked women, on the other hand, frequently provide sensationalist stories for the media. <p>Channel 4's new drama, Sex Traffic, tells the story of two sisters from Moldova who are trafficked into prostitution. Elena and Vara are young, poor, gullible and beautiful. Once caught in the traffickers' net they are dragged across Europe, raped and violated along the way, arriving in London for the dramatic climax of their tale. </p> <p>Some migrant sex workers recognise Elena and Vara's experiences in their own lives, but many don't. Trafficked women are at one end of the spectrum, and at the other are women from a number of countries who are working independently. Most foreign sex workers fit into a large grey area between the two. </p> <p>Those who occupy the middle ground include Joanna, a Polish social worker who makes four or five times what she earns at home working two days a week in a flat in London; and Kim, from Thailand, who came here to escape poverty and sends home what to her family are vast sums of money. Lara, an Albanian woman who was brought here by her boyfriend, hands all her earnings over to him but adores him and considers herself to be loved and lucky. </p> <p>These women's situations are far from ideal but they are not as hopeless as the stereotypes. While the focus of factual and fictional media remains exclusively on the evils of trafficking, vital issues such as the personal safety and sexual health of migrant sex workers risk being overlooked. Some sex-work projects are hearing stories of women being exploited after they came to the UK and started sex working. More regulation of indoor sex work, where most migrant sex workers are based, could help guard against this. </p> <p>But the government's July consultation paper on prostitution - Paying the Price - focuses heavily on the victimisation of women in prostitution against their will and the need to exit those women. It talks less about how to reduce harm for those remaining. </p> <p>The harsh economic reality which some find ideologically problematic is that some women choose to work for a few hours a week servicing men's sexual needs rather than working 40 or 50 low-paid hours elsewhere. </p> <p>For those who have made a choice, albeit restricted, to sell sex, more needs to be done to improve their safety, to increase their access to sexual health and support services, and to extend their career choices. Labour says that it is proud of the things it has done to improve employment rights. Those who opt to sell sex deserve the same workplace rights and protection that the government has extended to others. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Rosie Campbell is chair of the UK Network of Sex Work Projects; Sex Traffic is screened tomorrow at 9pm </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:rosiecamp1@aol.com\">rosiecamp1@aol.com</a></p>",
  "It may have been Michael Howard's big speech, but the man who towers over this conference is not here. Tony Blair is on all lips, his name is hissed out in every speech, obsessively loathed just as Mrs Thatcher used to be at Labour conferences long ago. <p>It's a shame the Labour party is not here to glory at what it has done to the Tories. It is Tony Blair's cunning strategy (and Gordon Brown's prudence and David Blunkett's toughness on crime) that has reduced this once unassailable party to a puddle of uncertainty, punctuated with tribal war cries. </p> <p>When Liam Fox tried to emulate that famous killer-riposte with a resounding, \"Tony Blair, you are not Margaret Thatcher!\", it fell flat. Not because he is Maggie, but because he does bestride the political horizon as she did. Like her, he has been blessed in his opposition. Like her, he is not popular: she was always far more hated than loved; more voted against than for. But like her, he has the golden winning ticket - people still regard him as the most competent to govern. Again, like her he is not immortal or indefinitely secure in his post and his greatest error may trip him up yet. But sitting here in the Bournemouth conference hall is a salutary reminder of how completely Labour dominates the political scene. </p> <p>How did Labour do it? They did things only a few Tories gingerly start to perceive. When Labour was dominated by a rabble of Bennite unelectables, it had to rid itself of those supporters and face down its own conference, not pander to it. Read Giles Radice's just-published Diaries 1980-2001 for an excellent day-by-day account of what it took. Tories should read it to learn how ruthless the long road back from wilderness to centre ground must be. Labour waverers should read it to remind themselves of what New Labour forged, why it still triumphs - and how easily it might slide back to factionalism and fantasy politics. </p> <p>Michael Howard is deluged with advice from back-seat drivers. Turn right! Turn left! Take the \"common sense\" road, or head down into \"core vote\" valley. They are more lost than Labour was, since Labour had only one road to travel, with no threat on the left, while the Tories' vulnerable seats are attacked on both flanks. Should Howard head off Ukip as the right urge, or turn to face what wiser heads warn is by far the greater Lib Dem threat? He can't do both at once, yet much zig-zagging is going on here. </p> <p>In the end, Howard ploughed firmly to the right, while promising new honesty to heal the distrust caused by Blair. But as he drove his party further Eurosceptic than ever before, his promise to pull out of some EU treaties is as dishonest as it is impossible to deliver. People might spot a certain dishonesty, too, in his lachrymose gratitude to Britain for saving him from the gas chambers in the same breath as his pledge to pull out of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. </p> <p>Otherwise, it was a speech that prided itself on the modesty of its promises. His five key points were good Tory stuff - school discipline, clean hospitals, more police, lower taxes, and less immigration - things of genuine popular concern. So why doesn't it fly? One of the sensibles in the shadow cabinet told me they still had to earn the right to be trusted before people would absorb these good old Tory themes. Only once firmly back in the land of ordinary people will voters warm to them again on law and order, taxes and immigration. Labour did not claw its way back by harping on about poverty, but by getting serious on crime and spending. </p> <p>So what would it take for the Tories to prove themselves back in the human race? First, a heartfelt embrace of the welfare state forever, no more yearning for new ways to subsidise private medicine or schools - both errors they made again yesterday. A convincing Tory cabinet would themselves use state schools and the NHS like ordinary people: they forget that under 10% use the private sector and that half the population earns less than \u00a322,000 for a full week's work. And they need some at least plausible plan for helping the poorest 20%. To be be lieved on these things, they need to pledge no tax cuts, just as Labour pledged no tax rises. They might even revisit Edward Heath's old phrase and promise action on \"the unacceptable face of capitalism\", the unwarranted fat-cat pay in the City. </p> <p>But why would anyone vote for \"a spineless photocopy\" of Labour, as young Tim Collins put it in his very old-Tory rant? Because all governments make errors and expire: Labour already shows signs of ageing. Because however much the Tories transform themselves into New Conservatives, everyone will always know they are the toughest on crime, immigration and tax. </p> <p>To all those on the left who think Tony Blair is a Tory, I wish you had been here to see the real thing. Note that Michael Howard made no mention whatever of poverty. Compare that to Labour's child-poverty pledge. He said nothing on childcare, nothing to woo back women voters. The whole array of policies on offer from the platform is strangely thin, with the feel of ideology devised in Central Office, lacking the substantial hard work Labour did to prepare for power. Labour is open to attack on various faltering policies, but the Tories do anecdotes, not killer research. </p> <p>But when this party is eventually re-elected - and they will be back when they have done some of the above - it will show how far Labour has pushed the centre ground leftwards since Mrs Thatcher's day. Something else Labour's left might learn here: Blair's snatching of \"choice\" really has dished the Tories' best line. Conservatives' \"choice\" is money taken out of public funds for the better-off to spend elsewhere: it only highlights Labour determination to make services more responsive to everyone within the welfare state. The \"choice\" coup is just another example of how the Tories did not jump down into these depths all by themselves: they were also pushed by Labour, which still holds them down there. </p> <p>Ahead is a long climb back out, but few Tories seem to know what a ladder looks like. Bringing back John Redwood to see off Ukip was just more digging. His bellowed anti-Europe diatribes breathe the monomania that still sets the conference afire. What else gets them whooping? Hunting, speed cameras, inheritance tax and wind farms. At a law-and-order fringe the Tory heartland voices that rose to rant were distinctly peculiar, a bit swivel-eyed as they raged that prisons are like hotels and yobs are mollycoddled by social workers. </p> <p>Those are the people the Tories now have to shock to the marrow. Despite well-trained, sane-looking young candidates on show, much of the rabble roused here still looks as untypical of Middle England as the air-punching Trots of Labour's bad old days. Labour's hall these days is full of normal-looking types, but the Tory fightback to normality has barely begun.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The following are extracts from Michael Howard's keynote address yesterday to the Conservative conference in Bournemouth: <p>Politicians, all politicians, have made promises they have failed to keep. In 1992 we promised to cut taxes year on year. But we put them up. </p> <p>In 1997 Labour said there would be no tax increases at all. They put them up... Let's face facts. What has happened on tax and on Europe has damaged people's faith in politics. So it's hardly surprising that people don't trust politicians today. </p> <p>In the real world, if you say you're going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you can lose your job. It's called accountability... What we start, we will follow through. And we will give people clear measures against which we can be judged. </p> <p>That's why we're setting out a clear Timetable for Action: what we'll do, when we'll do it. It will put us on the line in a way that no government has ever been before... I'll choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver. And if they don't, I'll replace them with people who will. </p> <p>While we've let responsibility decline, we've allowed \"rights\" to proliferate. You hear it all the time, \"I've got my rights\". The verbal equivalent of two fingers to authority. The Human Rights Act has tipped the balance of justice away from the victim in favour of the troublemaker. </p> <p>That's why we're reviewing it. And if it can't be reformed, we'll get rid of it.</p> <p>Billions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been spent on the NHS. And what have we got to show for that? Bureaucrats, people waiting in pain for operations, dirty hospitals. More people die every year from hospital infections than are killed on Britain's roads. Two years ago my mother-in-law died from a hospital-acquired infection. Yes, she was old. Yes, she was frail. But she still enjoyed life. She need not have died. </p> <p>I want to be accountable on Europe too. On day one we will set the date for the referendum on the constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. </p> <p>Europe isn't working properly today and the constitution will only make matters worse. The EU is spewing out too many regulations. It's holding our economy back. We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline. We need a new approach to Europe.</p> <p>We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to people fleeing persecution, and welcoming families who want to settle here and work. We have a long tradition of firm but fair immigration controls. But today, immigration is chaotic and out of control. </p> <p>Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country. And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent. All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused.</p> <p>So... Michael Ancram will signal Britain's intention to pull out of the 1951 UN refugee convention... We want... genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue. </p> <p>The world is a better place without Saddam Hussein... In the run-up to the war, Tony Blair did not tell the truth. He did not give a truthful account of the intelligence he received. He did not behave as a British prime minister should. [He] has said that mistakes were made, [that] he accepts responsibility. But... it is a question of credibility.</p> <p>What if this prime minister asks people to trust him again? Could the British people trust him a second time?</p> <p>I owe everything I am to this country, I really do mean it. I owe my life to it. My father told me Britain was the best country in the world. I think it was and... still is. But I know we could be doing so much better. And it's because I think I can help make things better that I am standing before you today... I'm here so I can give back to Britain a tiny fraction of what Britain has given to me.</p>",
  "<p>The auto-rickshaw wallah ignored the many perils of driving in these parts to look over his shoulder into his passenger's bag. \"Pass?\" he implored, with doleful brown eyes. </p> <p>After two epic series India v Australia is the match they want to see, even in laid-back Bangalore, well away from the country's traditional cricket centres of Mumbai (Bombay), Chennai (Madras) and Kolkata (Calcutta). </p> <p>\"Everybody wants a pass,\" Sudhakar Rao, assistant secretary of the<strong> </strong> Karnataka State Cricket Association, said at the vast Chinnaswamy Stadium yesterday. If you thought Twenty20 cricket was big you should take a look at this. </p> <p>\"It is maybe the biggest series in the world now,\" said Rao. \"We will only get bigger crowds when Pakistan come here next year, but everyone knows this, against Australia, is the championship of the world.\" </p> <p>Kolkata and Delhi are the major centres that miss out on this four-Test series. As in England, venues are rotated and the series starting here today will move on to Chennai, Nagpur and Mumbai. </p> <p>Asia is home to the world's most passionate cricket followers. When Tony Greig led England here in 1976-77 he marvelled that a crowd of 10,000 turned up at the stadium in Mumbai - and that was just for the net practice. </p> <p>\"You don't get crowds like that for practice now because of the security issue,\" says Partha Rudra, a cricket writer from Kolkata. \"But you will see them outside the gates from seven in the morning just to get a glimpse of their heroes. </p> <p>\"If this match was taking place in Kolkata there would be a maximum of 100,000. But India-Australia has generated so much interest that there will be huge crowds wherever these matches are played.\" </p> <p>Rao expects a near-capacity crowd of 42,000 today - \"and they will be over 50,000 in the bigger cities. They all want to see more of the great series here in 2000-01 and in Australia a year ago.\" </p> <p>But yesterday we saw something new. The outfield was so full of backpackers that it looked like the Kensington Oval when England are in Barbados. </p> <p>\"There has never been this many Aussies before,\" said the Australian Cricket Board spokesman Jonathan Rose. \"They all want to see their boys get their hands on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy once again. We haven't won it since 1999-2000.\" </p> <p>Some 200,000 tickets have been printed for this match, ranging from \u00a310 to \u00a3100. In addition there are 8,000 tickets for VIPs, with their distribution a very fraught affair, and 2,000 badges for vendors and the media. </p> <p>There will be 300 security men, 300 additional volunteers, and 10 doctors have sacrificed their consultancies to be on standby. \"There are orthopaedic surgeons, general practitioners and chest physicians in case a player has breathing problems - you never know what will happen here,\" said Brijesh Patel, secretary of the KSCA. </p> <p>There will also be a vast TV audience for the game. The series will be shown on state television, the Supreme Court decided yesterday, although Zee Telefilms thought it had secured the rights when it signed a four-year deal worth $308m (\u00a3170m) last month. </p> <p>That deal collapsed when ESPN Star Sports, a company part-owned by Rupert Murdoch, challenged the decision in court. </p> <p>And then there is the cricket. Australia, guilty of overconfidence last time here when they won the first of the three Tests inside three days and then made India follow on in the second before losing the match and the series, will be more thoughtful in their approach. </p> <p>They will relish the relative coolness of Bangalore and, although they have misgivings about the very dry and cracked surface of the pitch, it should help their faster bowlers to reverse-swing as well as assisting Shane Warne, who prepared for the match last night by ignoring the curries on offer and tucking into a ham-and-pineapple pizza. </p> <p>Only two teams have come to India and won a Test series since David Gower's side in 1984-85 - Imran Khan's Pakistan in 1986-87 and Hansie Cronje's South Africa in 1999-2000, a tour that was soon submerged in the match-rigging scandal. </p> <p>India, though, have not been at their best in the Chinnaswamy Stadium, with two defeats and a draw in their three Tests here since 1998. </p> <p>Their two main strike bowlers in this match will not be their seamers but their spinners, Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble, who goes into the game only three wickets away from 400 in Tests. </p> <p>After recent series, though, it is their batsmen Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman, who has scored 965 runs in six Tests against Australia, who will be feared as much as any of the bowlers. </p> <p> <strong>Pitch watch</strong></p> <p> The surface, cracked and very dry, shocked Australia's coach John Buchanan when he first saw it. Should help spin from the start, assist reverse swing, get low and slow and possibly crack up on the fourth day . </p> <p> <strong> Weather </strong> Showery and sunny. </p> <p><strong> Temperature </strong> Maximum 24C (81F). <strong> </strong></p> <p><strong> Maximum humidity</strong> 88%. </p> <p><strong> Win toss and bowl </strong> Batting may not be easy on the first day and Shane Warne or Harbhajan Singh can profit. </p> <p> <strong> India:</strong> Aakash Chopra, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Sourav Ganguly (capt), Youvraj Singh (wk), Parthiv Patel, Irfan Pathan, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan. </p> <p><strong> Australia:</strong> Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Simon Katich, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Clarke, Adam Gilchrist (capt/wk), Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath.</p>",
  "<b> Yesterday</b> <p> In the main address of the conference Michael Howard said he would \"bring power back to Britain\". His passionately patriotic speech focused on core Tory issues such as crime and immigration. </p> <p>Conservatives attempted to live up to the conference slogan of Timetable for Action by setting out detailed plans for their first days in power should they win the election. </p> <p>The education spokesman, Tim Collins, promised to scrap top-up fees while the health spokesman, Andrew Lansley, guaranteed to publish league tables of hospital performance rates and infection rates and offered patients the \"right to choose\". </p> <p>At a Guardian lunchtime fringe meeting the party revealed its mood. Asked if the Tories could win the election, only a third of the audience were prepared to put their hands up. Even fewer thought they would win. </p> <p><b> Today</b><br> </p> <p> <b> 9.30am:</b> The last full day of the conference season begins with a pensions debate and speech by David Willetts. </p> <p><b> 12.00: </b> The shadow home secretary, David Davis, speaks. </p> <p><b> 2.15pm:</b> The afternoon session focuses on development and defence with speeches from Alan Duncan and Nicholas Soames. </p> <p><b> 3.15pm:</b> Guest speaker Jan Zahradil, Czech MEP. </p> <p><b> 3.50pm:</b> Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram. </p> <p><b> 4.15pm:</b> Conservative question time with guests including Boris Johnson and Malcolm Rifkind.</p>",
  "With Elgar's Nimrod echoing out around the conference hall, a rare event took place yesterday at the end of Michael Howard's speech. <p>For the first time in living memory Tory MPs from across the party were united as they gushed about their leader's conference speech. \"Michael touched all the right buttons, with red meat for the activists and sensible messages for the electorate,\" declared one shadow minister who has been highly sceptical of the leadership. </p> <p>With voters expressing cynicism about all political parties, Howard aides spent months crafting a vision in mild language in the hope that it would not be dismissed out of hand as unreal istic. Abandoning what one adviser called the \"Blair messianic stuff\" ran the risk that the speech would be greeted with yawns by MPs and commentators who would claim that Mr Howard lacked a vision for the future. </p> <p>Mr Howard believes he squared this circle by setting out his \"timetable for action\", which spells a modest set of pledges which would be met within days of taking office. </p> <p>Abandoning the prisoner early release scheme and doing away with police paperwork may not amount to the sort of vision that carried Margaret Thatcher into Downing Street. But one well placed Tory said: \"The key issue is trust and everything we offer has to be credible. If you add up our pledges they would also transform Britain within days of our taking office.\" </p> <p>To show that he means business, Mr Howard promised to sack any minister who fails to deliver. He told the conference: \"What people want from their politicians is accountability, responsibility and a little humility... So I won't pretend I can solve every problem, right every wrong or cure every ill.\" </p> <p>The newly humbled Mr Howard showed his modest approach by resisting pressure from the party's right to offer a clear pledge to cut taxes. He merely committed himself to putting Britain \"back on the path to lower taxes\" by cutting billions of pounds from government spending. In one of the speech's most carefully crafted sentences, he said: \"When I can, I will cut taxes.\" </p> <p>MPs on the right, who believed that a guarantee of tax cuts would transform the election campaign, accepted this qualified commitment. Where the right could have been disappointed on tax, the left and centre could have been disappointed as Mr Howard faced up to the most immediate threat to the Tories: the growing support for the UK Independence party. Mr Howard did not repeat his tactics of the summer when he was criticised for boosting Ukip's support by attacking the party in name. </p> <p>Instead, he attempted to reach out to disaffected Eurosceptic Tories by promising to repatriate powers back from Brussels and to hold a referendum on the EU constitution within months of an election victory. \"If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you're from, come and join us,\" he said.</p> <p>The most prominent moderate in the shadow cabinet signalled yesterday that Mr Howard's attempt to reach out to the right - most notably, his pledge to tackle the \"chaotic and out of control\" immigration system - should go no further. \"A party is only ready for government when it addresses the concerns of all voters and not just those of its own supporters,\" said Tim Yeo in remarks aimed at the grassroots.</p> <p>As they filed out of the conference hall, one shadow minister summed up the cautious mood: \"If we get a good run on the telly and we get a bounce then maybe we'll turn the tide. If not, then it's the Charge of the Light Brigade for us.\"</p>",
  "The home secretary and parliament got it wrong in deciding they could lock up foreign nationals suspected of terrorism indefinitely without trial while allowing British terrorism suspects full legal protections, nine law lords were told yesterday. <p>David Pannick QC, intervening on behalf of the civil rights organisation Liberty in an appeal brought by nine detainees, urged the law lords to rule that the powers in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 violated the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>Mr Pannick said: \"What this case comes down to is that in a time of national crisis there is always a substantial risk that the legislature will react by adopting measures which do not take into account the interests of unpopular minorities.\" </p> <p>It was the duty of the court to decide dispassionately whether the balance had been properly struck in allowing foreign suspects, but not British nationals, to be detained indefinitely, he said. </p> <p>He reminded the law lords -sitting as a panel of nine instead of the usual five - that they did not have the same responsibility for enforcing the law as the US supreme court. Contrary to some press reports, the home secretary, David Blunkett, would not be required to release the detainees if the law lords ruled against him.</p> <p>In ruling that indefinite detention for foreign nationals only was incompatible with the convention, the judges would be \"inviting parliament to think again\", said Mr Pannick. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett says the act is an immigration measure and justifiably limited to foreign nationals. But Mr Pannick said immigration law allowed foreigners to be detained only pending deportation. The hearing is expected to end tomorrow.</p>"
