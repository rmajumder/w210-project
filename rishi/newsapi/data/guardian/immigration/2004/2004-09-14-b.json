  "<p><strong>Premature preamble</strong> Evening. Like a musical involving Kenneth Branagh, this has the potential to be an absolute stinker. But don't let that stop you sending in emails and watching how many times Joe Cole runs down a blind alley.</p> <p><strong>Random myth-shattering</strong> If I hear one more person say that Ashley Cole had Cristiano Ronaldo in his pocket in the Euro 2004 quarter-final, I'll scthweam until it hurts.</p> <p><strong>Team news</strong> Chelsea have gone with Gudjohnsen and Drogba up front, the usual four - Tiago, Cole, Makelele and Lampard - in midfield, and Ferreira, Terry, Gallas and Bridge at the back. </p> <p><strong>The teams</strong></p> <p> <strong>PSG:</strong> Letizi, Mendy, Helder, Pierre-Fanfan, Armand, Ogbeche, M'Bami, Coridon, Cana, Rothen, Pauleta. Subs: Alonzo, Pancrate, Cisse, Ibisevic, Ateba, Badiane, Ljuboja. </p> <p> <strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech, Paulo Ferreira, Gallas, Terry, Bridge, Tiago, Makelele, Cole, Lampard, Gudjohnsen, Drogba. Subs: Pidgeley, Ricardo Carvalho, Mutu, Kezman, Duff, Geremi, Parker. Referee: Manuel Enrique Mejuto Gonzalez (Spain) </p> <p><strong>7.30pm</strong> I haven't had a single email yet, which is good of you. So I'll ramble randomly about how good the first track on The Killers' album is. Those of you who are uninitiated: initiate yourself. </p> <p><strong>7.35pm</strong> Jerome Rothen is playing wide left for PSG; he looked class for Monaco last year, so it'll be interesting to see him up against the jittery Paulo Ferreira.</p> <p><strong>7.40pm</strong> \"At least you've actually settled in for your report,\" says Tracy Mohr. \"Barry Glendenning is probably out having a pint.\" </p> <p><strong>7.42pm</strong> \"How long before Damien Duff gets fed-up of being left on the bench at Chelsea and asks for a move in January?\" says Eamonn Wynne. Four months?</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Away we go, then.</p> <p><strong>2 min</strong> More catcalls than a weary wife who's in a hurry to go to bed only to find her moggies are still out and about as Chelsea knock it around patiently early on and win a corner.</p> <p><strong>4 min</strong> PSG have had a worst start to their campaign than my beloved Reds: P5 W0 D2 L3. Oof. \"The first track may be good but what about the rest of the drivel,\" says Simon Blake of The Killers album. \"Thought I'd start the e-mails off with a bit of a 'The Killers', derivative or what debate. Go and put a Wilco album on and expand your horizons.\" Would a Betty Boo album do? Agreed that the rest of the album is underwhelming given the fawning reviews, but the first song rocks.</p> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Dominant start from Chelsea; Lampard's corner finds Tiago, whose bobbling header from 10 yards is easily saved.</p> <p><strong>7 min</strong> Fine run from Coridon, who almost joined Everton in the summer. He stormed from halfway, skipped past John Terry way too easily and, with Cech off his line, dinked a chip just wide from the edge of the area. Meanwhile, Eidur Gudjohnsen is leaking claret like a character in a Guy Ritchie film after a clash of heads. That looks really nasty and I doubt we'll be seeing him again. In this game. Chimpfeatures Kezman is set to come on.</p> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Kezman does indeed come on for Gudjohnsen. The only Champions League contribution of his I remember is a stonker of a goal against Manchester United four years ago. Immediately he gets away on the right, but a Waller-heavy first touch lets him down.</p> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Chelsea are still bossing possession, with Lampard as ubiquitous as ever and Cole trying to be, before Mendy dumps Cole on his backside. They have history, those two, from a Bolton/West Ham ding-dong two seasons ago. Eidur Gudjohnsen, meanwhile, has a very deep cut just above his eye. It looked nasty, did that. </p> <p><strong>15 min</strong> The emails have dried up faster than a non-trouser-wearing house husband. Anyone?</p> <p><strong>17 min</strong> Still nothing doing. \"Any idea why the ever-so-famous Lenny Pidgeley's the back-up keeper rather than Cudicini?\" asks Alexis Morgan. \"They've gone from having a zillion keepers to none.\" Must be an injury. Either that or he got carted off to some cult-type thing like that bloke in Amelie.</p> <p><strong>19 min</strong> PSG are happy to sit and wait, with just the one man - Pauleta, who had such a storming Euro 2004 - up top. They're playing like the away side, but at the moment Chelsea look like they lack the wherewithal to break them down. Quite why Damien Duff can't get in this team, I really don't know.</p> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Absurd dive from Ogbeche after a tackle from Kezman. I haven't seen dignity surrendered so quickly since my last visit to the Garage.</p> <p><strong>21 min</strong> Pauleta cuts infield and tries his luck from 30 yards. He shouldn't have bothered. </p> <p><strong>23 min</strong> Peter Dreary makes the inevitable 'Coridon/corridor' pun. I'm glad he beat me to it because it was nowhere near as funny as I thought it might be. Meanwhile, brilliant defending by Mendy after Drogba, one foot behind the other Ronaldo-style, lifted a lovely ball into Tiago's path eight yards out.</p> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Chelsea are the better side still, and Cole is coming into it a lot more now. Here he is taken out by Helder 35 yards out; I say taken out - he hardly touched him in hindsight. </p> <p><strong>26 min</strong> From the free-kick, Lampard dinks one to the far post and Drogba, six yards out, can't enough leverage on his header to beat Letizi. No more than a half-chance.</p> <p><strong>28 min</strong> Frankly, PSG are a poor side. Even Rothen, who was electric last year for Monaco, is struggling to pass the ball. Armand takes out his frustration at his team's modest performance by whapping high over the bar from range.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! PSG 0 - 1 CHELSEA</strong> John Terry scores a simple goal. Routine back-post corner from Lampard, Letizi comes and misses by a mile, and Terry nods into an empty net from six yards.</p> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Like a strangely indifferent man in a jacuzzi with Girls Aloud, PSG have finally had their passion stirred - MBami belts one from 30 yards than Cech flaps behind for a corner. \"Please spare us the Wilco endorsements,\" says Trent Smither, who sounds like a Swingers/Simpsons hybrid. \"Soft, whining and self-obsessed. Actually, rather apt for a Chelsea match.\"</p> <p><strong>35 min</strong> PSG's only threat at the moment - such as it is - is from range: it really is hard to get in behind this Chelsea defence, as most Premiership clubs have found, and I think Rothen is PSG's only real hope of doing so. Shame he's having a 'mare. \"Have you heard the new Green Day song, \"American Idiot\"?\" asks David Slider. Nope. </p> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Rothen does burst down the left, cuts it back and Ogbeche, 12 yards out, scuffs a ball that was slightly behind him straight at Cech. Like Joe Cole's ego, PSG's threat is growing - but so is Chelsea's, and Cole is at the sharp end of much of it.</p> <p><strong>38 min</strong> \"Doesn't Kezman look more like Dr. Teeth, everyone's favourite muppet and keyboard maestro for The Electric Mayhem?\" says Billy Lalor. Like the PG Tips marketing department, I'm sticking with the chimp. Or was it a chipmunk?</p> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Like Scousers in a minute-by-minute reporter's favourite cliche, the game has calmed down again now, with Chelsea conducting the tempo as they did for the first half-hour.</p> <p><strong>43 min</strong> I haven't been impressed with Kezman at all since he came on. Obviously he'd return the compliment if he saw me play, but he has been poor - scatty, indecisive, and <em>not. very. good</em>.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! PSG 0 - 2 CHELSEA</strong> Didier Drogba scores. Kezman, slipped through by a delightful outside-of-the-right-foot pass from Joe Cole, proves my point by over-running a one-on-one, but Drogba follows up to finish into an open goal from 20 yards before goading the PSG fans with a Cantonaesque hands-to-the-ears gesture. Have some of that.</p> <p><strong>Half time</strong> Impressive, dominant stuff from Chelsea, for who the ex-West Ham pair of Cole and Lampard have been excellent, along with the ever-unsung Makelele. I said it at 2-0 to England the other week, but this really is game over. </p> <p><strong>Half-time space-filler</strong> Two things have stood out tonight (Lampard doesn't count, such is his permanent excellence): Cole, who's been impish, mischievous and dangerous. Now if only he can do it against a decent team. And the Chelsea defence who do it - basically, let absolutely nothing past - against everyone. They are impressive, and seriously intimidating.</p> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Off we go: no changes for either side. \"Has Batman showed up yet?\" says a man whose email address is Spliff94@aol.com. And if you think that's bad, here's his punchline. \"I know he had this match as his next gig after the Palace.\" GO BACK TO YOUR HUMAN TRAFFIC DVD AND NEVER DARKEN THIS DOOR AGAIN. YOU HEAR?</p> <p><strong>47 min</strong> At 0-2, you'd expect the home side to come storming out of the blocks. 4-5-1 you say? Oh.</p> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Prolonged period of possession for PSG, with absolutely no penetration. Chelsea harry and hustle like a pack of nouveau riche dogs until the ball is given away.</p> <p><strong>50 min</strong> Clumsy work from Kezman, but he eventually finds Cole on the edge of the box, who scythes across his volley and forces Letizi to flap over the top. If this were Arsenal, it'd end 4- or 5-0. Do Chelsea have the same quality and ruthlessness? Am I better looking than Jake Gylenhaal?</p> <p><strong>54 min</strong> PSG are flatter than a depressed pancake: it's hard to fathom how overwhelmingly one-sided this has been. Either Chelsea are very, very good or PSG are very, very bobbins. The truth, as ever in this particularly irritating cliche, lies somewhere between the two. </p> <p><strong>55 min</strong> Joe Cole nearly gets the goal he deserves. Lovely lob over the top from Lampard, but Cole tries to take one touch too many and is muscled off it. Cut to the other end and Pauleta works Cech - work it, work it - from the edge of the area.</p> <p><strong>60 min</strong> Trying to break down this Chelsea defence is like trying to locate Michael Corleone's heart. PSG have had absolutely nothing all night except strikes from distance: another one there from Pauleta is again close enough for Cech to save comfortably.</p> <p><strong>62 min</strong> I'm happy to call it now: Kezman is rubbish. If he makes it in English football, I'll star as Francis Begbie in the follow up to Trainspotting.</p> <p><strong>63 min</strong> I'll get me coat. Lovely play from Kezman, who knocks it one side of Helder on the right and scampers - he still runs clumsily, though - the other before Helder chops him down cynically. Clear yellow card.</p> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Lampard gets booked ... for taking Chelsea's free-kick too quickly. What a joke.</p> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Nice play from Drogba, who spins on his heels like John Travolta in the late-70s and whacks one towards goal which is deflected for a corner.</p> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Ljuboja is on for Coridon, and he has a haircut that words can barely describe it's so bad. I'll try. He has a gee-Mom-what-a-greaseback, only with a white mohawky stripe all the way down the middle and back. The youth of today, eh?</p> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Kezman wins the ball back well and Drogba, six yards out but at a tight angle, flashes one across the face like Christopher Moltisanti in a bad mood with Adriana.</p> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Geremi on for Cole. If Jose Mourinho owned a shop, he'd be shutting it up now. The only time he'll ever shut up, etc. Fair play to Cole, meanwhile: I don't like the smug, arrogant little so-and-so, but he was excellent tonight.</p> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Free-kick to Chelsea, 20 yards out, on the right of the PSG box...</p> <p><strong>75 min</strong> ... which Drogba plants easily into the net. <strong> PSG 0 - 3 CHELSEA</strong> Simple sidefoot up and over the wall, but it didn't go in the corner and Letizi - who put too much weight on his right foot and tried to second-guess Drogba - was arguably at fault again.</p> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Tiago, as Steve Popisil points out, has been pretty anonymous, but that's a rare blemish on an emphatic performance. </p> <p><strong>79 min</strong> Kezman's shot is deflected towards the far corner by Helder, and Letizi just scrambles it round. Good save. \"Like a kid without a nap, your similies are getting tired,\" says Cbudd. It's a fair cop: I've been worse than PSG tonight. At least I can spell similes, mind.</p> <p><strong>81 min</strong> \"21 Grams is excellent, lots of shots of Nicole Kidman's mate bot (can't remember her name), and also Sean Penn (for the ladies),\" says the ubiquitous Alison Jeeves. Naomi Watts. Meanwhile, Duff is on for Drogba.</p> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Rothen off for Ateba. We can all go home soon.</p> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Classic burst from Duff quickens the pulse-rate like a random sighting of Cheryl Tweedy. But generally this game is snoozing to a conclusion; Chelsea's dominance has been absolutely overwhelming.</p> <p><strong>89 min</strong> \"Buy the film,\" says the verbose Gerard Scott.</p> <p><strong>Full time: PSG 0 - 3 CHELSEA</strong> It's all over, and that was as emphatic an away win as you could wish for. Yet as impressive as Chelsea were - especially their defence, which is rapidly acquiring a monstrous impregnability - Paris Saint-Germain were absolutely diabolical. I'm off; thanks for all your emails. Rob.</p>",
  "<p>If sauna, tar and vodka don't cure your disease, then you will die. It is an old saying in Finland and, while I wasn't particularly sick when I flew to Tampere, the theory had to be put to stringent scientific test.</p> <p>Tampere is the Manchester of Finland, my masseur said, limbering me up for a daunting day of canoeing and sauna. Like Manchester, Finland's second largest city was built on the cotton industry after a Scot, James Finlayson, established the biggest cotton mill in Scandinavia on its waterways. Tampere has a pretty square, cobbled streets and carefully restored industrial buildings now turned into pubs, restaurants and museums.</p> <p>And then there is the music. \"What British music do you like?\" asks my masseur. I'm too relaxed to answer. \"Cliff Richard?\" \"Er, not really.\" \"Phil Collins? Huey Lewis and the News? Hank Marvin?\"</p> <p>Music is not really part of the Tampere cure. The size of UK and Ireland, Finland is blessed with 188,000 lakes and a population of just over five million. That's about 27 people per lake. There is also one sauna for every three people.</p> <p>So it is not hard to find a wood-fired sauna by a beautiful lake all for yourself. Ten minutes' drive from Tampere, you can rent a wooden fisherman's cottage on your own island, hire canoes and go fishing, mushroom-picking or hiking.</p> <p>Finns prickle at the association that saunas enjoy with their bigger neighbours, Sweden. The sauna is Finland's playground, boardroom and place of worship rolled into one. In the old days, saunas were used to get clean instead of bathrooms; now most new homes are built with one.</p> <p>On the door of one sauna was a picture of skimpy Tony Blair-style Speedos with a firm red line across them. It was not a notice put up by the fashion police but a ban on anything other than nudity. Here the Finns expose an authoritarian streak: you must remain naked at all times in the sauna. You must be at ease with your body.</p> <p>According to some Finns, the Lycra in your modesty-protecting trunks emits noxious fumes in the heat of the sauna. They would say that, wouldn't they? Luckily, at the sauna I visited, the Finns were typically easygoing and could tolerate repressed British tourists entering the saunas in their Speedos. You sit there, think and sweat for 15 minutes, before running outside and flinging yourself into the clear, cold waters of the lake. And then repeat. Your heart races; your body tingles hot and cold. It is brilliant. You feel relaxed and yet alive, surrounded by sunshine, scented pine trees and silence.</p> <p>Cured and ready to take in some culture, you can visit the building in Tampere where Lenin first met Stalin, which now claims to be the only operational Lenin museum left in the world. It has particular resonance with many Finns: the country was torn by civil war between the \"reds\" and the \"whites\" after gaining independence in 1917. There is also some fantastic Lenin tat for sale.</p> <p>Tampere boasts a museum of the national sport, ice hockey, a spy museum and the magical Muumilaakso, the Moomin museum. It is worth the airfare alone for anyone who half remembers the cartoon series or Tove Jansson's original Moomintroll books. There is a delightfully detailed replica of the rambling Moomin house and fantastic original artwork showing Moonminland in all its slightly trippy glory. You can buy the books, Moomin pottery - newly fashionable and costing a fortune in Selfridges in London - and cuddly Moomintrolls and Moominmamas. Sadly the museum does not sell any prints of the artwork.</p> <p>Scandinavia has a reputation for being expensive but, especially after a very cheap flight, prices in Tampere aren't bad. You can get an immaculate self-service hotel room that sleeps four for \u20ac 55 euros, while drinks and meals are London prices.</p> <p>Fresh herring and salmon are local specialities as are wild mushrooms and mustamakkara puolukkahillo, a Tampere speciality of black sausage with lingon berries (as collected from the forests by Moominmama).</p> <p>There are also excellent steaks in German restaurants and Russian restaurants, while you can feast on reindeer and wild boar at Harald, a Viking-style restaurant. The food is excellent, the descriptions on the menu funny (\"If there was one thing the Vikings respected the French for, it was their toast\") and there aren't many places where you can eat under the watchful - if glassy - eye of a stuffed bear.</p> <p>Invigorated by the sauna, I must now, according to the saying, take some tar. Which brings me to Harald's dessert: tar ice cream. While some officials are trying to ban it, most Finns believe tar - as in macadam - has excellent healing properties. Granted, the ice cream is not black and treacly and doesn't look like it could clog up your lungs or cause a particularly painful death. After a bellyful of boar, it actually has some palate-cleansing properties. But it is foul, disgusting, horrible. It tastes just like tar.</p> <p>Tarnished by tar, the only option left is to revive with vodka. Tampere is no Manchester by night, but there are some nice little bars, late licenses and plenty of spirits on offer. Mocca, one of several sleek bar-clubs in Tampere, is well populated with bright young Finns. Rather than Cliff or Phil, the DJs spin Finnish hip-hop and American R'n'B. Cafe Europa has a bohemian feel and battered sofas, while the Plevna Brewery has a German beer-hall vibe.</p> <p>The locals are friendly and trendy and their apparent fondness for binge drinking does not result in the shouting, vomiting viciousness of Britain on a Saturday night but in some spectacularly calm staggering down the streets at 4am.</p> <p>Finland has a split personality: swathed in snow and darkness for much of the winter and bathed in nightless days during summer. But if you are quick, you can catch it in a more subtle third stage in September, when the leaves start to turn but the sun still bounces off the lakes. The tar may not cure any end-of-summer blues, but the sauna and the vodka certainly will.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> flies from Stansted to Tampere, starting at \u00a33.99 one-way in September. The journey takes two-and-a-half hours.</p> <p>Patrick stayed at the <a href=\"http://www.omena.com\">Omenahotel</a>, \u20ac55 per night.

  "Cuba appeared to have escaped the worst ravages of Hurricane Ivan today as the most powerful Caribbean storm in a decade passed over the island's sparsely populated western tip and spared its main urban areas. <p>There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or serious damage to buildings. The 162mph winds tore through the tobacco growing heartland for Cuba's famed cigar industry, but planting there does not begin until next month. </p> <p>Trees and power lines were brought down in the western provincial capital of Pinar del Rio. More than 1.3 million people had earlier been evacuated from a region still recovering from Hurricane Charley.</p> <p>Ivan continued its western course after leaving Cuba and gathered strength as it approached eastern Mexico and the southern United States, where thousands of people were making last-minute preparations or fleeing coastal zones.</p> <p>World oil prices rose as companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico prepared for disruption to gas and oil operations. Shell closed down production from its central Gulf of Mexico operations today, after already halting output in the eastern Gulf. </p> <p>Mexico began evacuating 12,000 residents and tourists from low-lying tourist areas around Cancun on the eastern seaboard of the Yucatan peninsula as choppy seas and heavy rain arrived.</p> <p>Five Florida counties urged or, in some cases, ordered residents to leave amid forecasts that Ivan could hit the coast as soon as tomorrow. </p> <p>Before hitting Cuba, the eastern end of Ivan battered the Cayman Islands with 20ft (6 metre) waves crashing against the sea wall at the port in George Town. </p> <p>Residents said parts of the islands were under 8ft of water. Locals and British expatriates described roofs \"peeling off like they were fastened on with Velcro\" and trucks bobbing on the rising floodwater like bath toys. All three islands were without electricity, the online news service Cayman Net News reported. </p> <p>\"The glass doors at Cayman Net News thankfully resisted the worst of the flooding, even though at times it was like looking at an aquarium as the water rose some 3ft outside,\" the service said. </p> <p>It is estimated that the hurricane has killed at least 65 people. The Pan American Health Organisation said 37 people had died in Grenada and 19 in Jamaica. Five people are thought to have died in Venezuela, one in Tobago, one in Barbados, four in the Dominican Republic and three in Haiti. </p> <p>In Jamaica, stores and shelters filled with more than 15,000 people were running short of food, according to Nadene Newsome of Jamaica's emergency relief agency. Officials planned to fly food into cut-off areas by helicopter. About 98% of the island is still without power and 40 roads were blocked by debris. </p> <p>The EU said it was sending \u00db1.5m (\u00a31m) in emergency aid to Grenada, to provide \"the most vulnerable people with emergency shelter, as well as food, drinking water, hygiene kits and tarpaulins for house roofing\". </p> <p>The EU was also preparing urgent emergency aid for other Carribean islands hit by Ivan, including Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba.</p> <p>Britain is also to provide emergency aid to help Cuba cope with the aftermath, the International development secretary, Hilary Benn, announced today. </p> <p>Plastic sheeting, cots and water purification equipment should be shipped to Grand Cayman in the next 24 hours to help authorities there cope with the chaos Ivan has caused, he added.</p> <p>Cuba's leader, Fidel Castro, has said he will not accept US aid. After Hurricane Charley, he rejected Washington's offer of $50,000 [\u00a328,000]. \"We won't accept a penny from them,\" he told state television. \"Even if they offered all that was necessary, $100m, $200m, we would not accept.\"</p>",
  "The London-based spokesman for the former Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov today called on western governments to reject Russia's handling of Chechnya or risk Islamist terrorists turning it into a recruiting ground for their cause. <p>Akhmed Zakayev, who was a deputy prime minister under Mr Maskhadov, also accused the Russian government of spreading lies about the Beslan school siege in a bid to discredit moderate Chechen politicians. </p> <p>The Russian president, Vladamir Putin, has put a \u00a36m price on the heads of Mr Maskhadov and the Chechen rebel commander Shamil Basayev, blaming the two men for the school hostage crisis. </p> <p>At least 326 people - half of them children - died after terrorists stormed a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, earlier this month and demanded Chechen independence. Another 356 people are still in hospital.</p> <p>At a press conference in London, paid for by the actor Vanessa Redgrave, Mr Zakayev today condemned the hostage takers, saying they were not representative of any political cause or even the human race.</p> <p>He spoke scathingly about Mr Putin, whom he accused of conducting a \"propaganda war along the best traditions of the Soviet KGB\".</p> <p>\"President Putin's subsequent linking of Aslan Maskhadov, a democratically elected president, to Shamil Basayev, who has accepted responsibility for a number of terrorist acts in the past, is a deliberate attempt to confuse international public opinion as to the real issues in the Chechen conflict,\" he said. </p> <p>It was the second time in a week that western leaders found themselves accused of double standards on terrorism.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, last week accused them of double standards for expecting Russian help in the war on Islamist terrorism while at the same time sheltering Chechen spokespeople - such as Mr Zakayev - who are considered by the Kremlin to be terrorists. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev today hit back, telling western governments their support for Mr Putin's approach on Chechnya amounted to double standards, accepting \"terrorism under a Russian flag\" in Chechnya in order to secure Kremlin cooperation in the fight against al-Qaida. </p> <p>\"If the world continues to ignore the Chechen problem, the responsibility for the ensuing Caucasus catastrophe will fall at the feet of Vladimir Putin and his western apologists,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Zakayev rejected Russian government claims that some of the hostage takers in Beslan had been Arab or African. He said it was more likely that the militants were local radicals involved in a bloody dispute between Ingush and Ossetian people. </p> <p>The Russian embassy in London today said it had no comment to make on Mr Zakayev's statements. </p> <p>He warned that, while Islamist fundamentalism had little role in Chechnya at the moment, al-Qaida and other terror groups could make inroads with a desperate population.</p> <p>\"The Chechen tragedy is being hijacked by those who fuel the ideologies of both international terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, who see in the conflict further evidence of the oppression of Muslims at the hands of the so-called great powers,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The west's reluctance to denounce Putin's approach to the Chechen problem is partly responsible for the fact that the cause of our people is now being manipulated by radical extremists who are at war with the west.\" </p> <p>The Russian government has repeatedly called for Mr Zakayev - who has been granted asylum in the UK - to be extradited to Russia to face terror charges. </p> <p>In November, a British judge ruled that Moscow's extradition request was a politically-motivated attempt to exclude Mr Zakayev from taking part in the peace process in Chechnya. </p> <p>Mr Putin has empowered his security services to hunt down those his government deems to be terrorists anywhere in the world, and Mr Zakayev said he now fears for his life. </p> <p>\"I'm sure the UK authorities did not fail to notice an open threat by the Russian government, but to date I have not changed the way I live,\" he said. Ms Redgrave said the relevant authorities had been contacted. </p> <p>Chechnya has been devastated by war and violence for almost a decade. In 1996, Russian forces withdrew from the southern region after separatist fighters battled them to a stalemate. Federal troops returned in September 1999 after rebels raided a neighbouring province and were blamed for a series of deadly apartment building bombings. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev seemed hopeful that a political solution to the problems of Chechnya could be reached with the Russian government, and urged Mr Putin to sit down at the negotiating table with Mr Maskhadov. </p> <p>So far, however, Mr Maskhadov has not halted attacks by Mr Basayev and other Chechen militants. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev said Mr Maskhadov was not able to fight on two fronts, reining in Chechen militants responsible for a string of deadly attacks in Russia and confronting tens of thousands of Russian military personnel in Chechnya. </p> <p>\"I assure you that, if any sort of agreement, or even a truce, is agreed, then we will solve the problem of Basayev, no matter what it costs us,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>British universities are enrolling more foreign students than ever before but the UK's share of the mushrooming global market in higher education is slipping, according to figures released today. </p> <p>The annual study, Education at a Glance, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), found that between 1998 and 2002 foreign enrolment increased by 34%, with 1.9m students enrolling on courses in OECD areas outside their own country. </p> <p>The UK's share of the market for foreign students dropped from 16% to 12% in this period although it remains joint second with Germany, behind the US which has 30%. The only other near competitors for attracting overseas students are Australia with 10% and France with 9% of the global market. </p> <p>Andreas Schleicher, an OECD analyst, said the UK remained \"a favourite student destination\" and added: \"The UK has traditionally been a country very open to foreign students. Other countries have emulated this.\" </p> <p>The economic forces driving the global market in knowledge are easy to see in the OECD report - graduates earn considerably more than non-graduates - 86% more in the US - and there is no sign that the massive increase in the numbers going to university is cheapening the value of a degree. For the graduate, the cost of university remains a very good investment, argues the report.</p> <p>It states: \"As new data show for the first time, rising tertiary education levels among citizens seem generally not to have led to an inflation of the labour-market value of qualifications. On the contrary, among the countries in which the proportion of 25-64 year-olds with tertiary qualifications increased by more than 5 percentage points since 1995 - Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom - most have seen falling unemployment and rising earnings benefits among tertiary graduates over the last years.\"</p> <p>Although the UK government's target of 50% of young people entering higher education remains controversial, it is only the average across OECD countries, where half of today's young adults now enter universities or other institutions offering similar qualifications at some stage during their life. </p> <p>An average 32% complete a first university-level degree, but this ranges from less than 20% in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland to 45% in Australia and Finland. </p> <p>The report adds: \"Almost all OECD countries have seen a rise in the education levels of their citizens over the past decade, and in some countries the increase has been spectacular. Enrolment in tertiary education, which covers both university-level education and high-level vocational programmes, increased between 1995 and 2002 by more than 50% in the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Korea and Poland, and by more than 20% in Australia, Finland, Ireland, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. </p> <p>\"Austria, France and Germany are the only countries which did not see increases, mainly because rising enrolment rates could not make up for the demographic decline in these countries.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said: \"Foreign student enrolment worldwide has increased by a third between 1998 and 2002. The UK has more than held its own, but the cake has got bigger. </p> <p>\"We have every intention of remaining one of the most popular destinations for overseas students. The British Council estimates that the UK economy could earn \u00a313bn a year from international students by 2010.\" </p>",
  "After weeks of bracing by the Bush White House, the category 5 storm has hit: Hurricane Kitty. Bestselling author Kitty Kelley's withering portrait of the Bush dynasty, The Family, is landing in bookstores on Tuesday - more than 720,000 copies of it. And the White House is already on high alert. \"This book is fiction and deserves to be treated as such,\" snarled Republican spokeswoman Christine Iverson, as the RNC fired off an anti-Kelley talking-points memo to friendly media assets. <p>The media blowback against Kelley, author of controversial biographies of Nancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra, has already begun. On the Monday morning Today Show, host Matt Lauer showed how tough an interviewer he can be when not questioning presidents and other potentates, pressing Kelley on who she's going to vote for in November (\"Who're you voting for?\" Kelley shot back) and the timing of the book's publication, weeks before the November election (\"Why not? It's relevant,\" countered the author, who's been working on the book for four years). </p> <p>The hottest dispute sparked by the book involves the allegation that George W Bush, who claimed to be clean and sober at the time, snorted cocaine with one of his brothers at the Camp David presidential retreat when his father was president. One of Kelley's sources - and the only one on the record - was Sharon Bush, the deeply aggrieved ex-wife of W's younger brother Neil. She is now in strong denial mode, even though her own publicist, who was present at a lunch where she told Kelley the story, confirms the accuracy of Kelley's account. Nonetheless, Lauer produced the Bush divorcee after his interview with Kelley to repeat her denials. </p> <p>While the Camp David coke party is getting the headlines, Kelley's book is filled with many other tawdry stories about the Bush dynasty. Here is a family that looks \"like The Donna Reed Show, and then you see it's The Sopranos\", Kelley tells Salon. </p> <p>As Kelley tells it, the dynasty had respectable origins - in the form of family patriarch Prescott Bush, the distinguished, moderate Republican senator from Connecticut - but rapidly slid into cynical opportunism, skulduggery, and a mean-spirited sense of entitlement. The first President Bush is presented as a weak yes man, driven not by political vision but a savage preppy spirit of competition instilled in him by his whirlwind of a mother. But it is his wife, Barbara (whom the ex-wife of White House counsel C Boyden Gray calls \"bull-dyke tough\"), and their eldest son, George, who are the true pieces of work in Kelley's book, a mother and son team brimming with such spite and ambition they would give the ruthless duo in The Manchurian Candidate the shivers. </p> <p>In one of the creepier passages of the book, a family gathering from hell at Kennebunkport, Maine, Barbara is shown mercilessly baiting her dry-drunk son, then governor of Texas, as a teetotalling 'Chosen One', while he keeps pleading to skip the cocktails and put on the feed bag, and his elderly father \"drools over [TV newswoman] Paula Zahn's legs\". </p> <p>One of the major themes in Kelley's book is the family's weakness for liquor and drugs. Alcoholism, she writes, runs deeply in the family and among its victims, according to one Bush family friend, was Prescott, a \"major-league alcoholic\", who was in the habit of checking himself into his men's club and country club to go on benders. And Kelley writes that George W Bush is not the only one in the first family who enjoyed illegal substances. While a student at Southern Methodist University in the 1960s, first lady Laura Bush was known \"as a go-to girl for dime bags of marijuana\".</p> <p>But, as one of W's Yalie frat brothers tells Kelley, it's not the substance abuse in Bush's past that's disturbing, it's the \"lack of substance ... Georgie, as we called him, had absolutely no intellectual curiosity about anything. He wasn't interested in ideas or in books or causes. He didn't travel; he didn't read the newspapers; he didn't watch the news; he didn't even go to the movies. How anyone got out of Yale without developing some interest in the world besides booze and sports stuns me.\" New Yorker writer Brendan Gill recalls roaming the Kennebunkport compound one night while staying there looking for a book to read - the only title he could find was The Fart Book.</p> <p>According to Kelley, the Bushes aggressively maintain their all-American family image by scrubbing government files of embarrassing facts, stonewalling journalists, and terrorising critics. \"Some people felt that George's past did not seep out and embarrass him and his family,\" she writes of the White House's current Bush, \"because he was protected by a coterie of former CIA men with an allegiance to his father.\" An Austin, Texas political consultant named Peck Young told Kelley that when a woman claiming to have been a call girl from Midland showed up in Austin with \"intimate knowledge\" of W during his oil wildcatting days, she was approached by what she described as \"intelligence types\" and left town abruptly. According to Young, the men \"made her realise that it was better to turn tricks in Midland than to stop breathing\". </p> <p>George HW Bush and wife Barbara dismissed Bill Clinton as a pathetic hillbilly when he challenged the incumbent in 1992. But, Kelley writes, Clinton was one of the few Bush opponents who knew how to back them down. As colourful stories from Clinton's sexual past in Arkansas began to surface during the campaign, a Clinton aide began digging into the senior Bush's own robust adultery. This included, writes Kelley, two long affairs.</p> <p>The Clinton aide told Kelley: \"I took my list of Bush women to his campaign operatives. I said I knew we were vulnerable on women, but I wanted to make damn sure they knew they were vulnerable too.\" After the eruption over Clinton's mistress Gennifer Flowers died down, sexual infidelity did in fact become a moot issue in the campaign. </p> <p>While Kelley is being savagely attacked as a tabloid sleaze queen, her book is more heavily researched and documented than Bush advocates allege. On occasion, she relies on sources that are less than reliable - inserting the story Hustler publisher Larry Flynt tried to put in media play about a girlfriend's abortion that W allegedly paid for before it was legal. Kelley says she decided to put the story in her book after interviewing the two investigators Flynt had hired to track down the story. But despite her flaws, Kelley has vigorously pursued leads about the powerful American dynasty - from Bush senior's shady CIA past to W's missing National Guard records - that the rest of the media should have. </p> <p>Salon spoke with Kelley on Monday afternoon at the midtown New York offices of Doubleday, her book publisher. </p> <p>[Salon:] The Bush forces are coming after you very strongly. And now the media is too. <br> [Kitty Kelley:] Yes, they are, this is what they do, this is how they operate. It's interesting, from talking with the media today, the European media is much less intimidated than the American press. The Americans are all saying, \"well, why should we listen to you. Look at the books you've written.\" Well, excuse me, those books have stood up, I stand behind everything in those books, they've stood the test of time. And this book will too. So I see how this media spin is working, and I'm not surprised. You'd think the media would look at my book and follow up on it - all right, she says here they instituted drug testing in the National Guard at such and such time, let's call up and find out if that's true. But don't beat me up just because I've come to you with almost a thousand sources. You know, I've gone through four sets of lawyers, because I'm dealing with a sitting president. </p> <p>[S:] You've gone through this before, of course, when Frank Sinatra tried to block publication of your unauthorised biography of him. How would you compare the heat you felt from Sinatra and his crowd and what you're going through now? <br>[KK:] It's worse now, because there's more at stake. With Sinatra, you just worried about getting the bejabbers beat out of you. But with the Bushes, they work on all sorts of levels to destroy the messenger so the message can't come through. But the message is the message. The stuff I've done is solid. Did I get everything? No. And you know something, we better hurry and try to get all the information we can get - because this president is trying to lock it all up through executive order, which means you won't be able to get presidential history, because the files and everything will be locked up. </p> <p>[S:] You write that the Bushes are particularly good at cleansing anything in government files that will besmirch the family reputation. How does that work? <br> [KK:] Well, you see it on all sorts of levels, from the trivial on up. For instance, I got a copy of the Bush family tree from the Bush presidential library. And at first we just thought a couple things were left off, but it was a number of things. Mentally retarded children from one branch of the family erased. Too many divorces in one family - that doesn't fit with the family-values image, so some ex-wives simply disappear. You could say that's just an oversight or mistake here and there. But when you see a pattern as I've seen over the past years of files redacted, too many mysterious fires that destroy records, state department files simply missing, gone, National Guard files. </p> <p>[S:]You also allege that the Bushes have tried to block people from talking with you and put pressure on your publisher. <br> [KK:] Yes, imagine the former president of the United States calling your publisher. I wrote George Herbert Walker Bush requesting an interview. He always responds to letters; he's famous for it. He even responded to Bob Woodward for a book. But he didn't respond to mine - he had an assistant phone the publisher of Doubleday, Steve Rubin. Imagine that pressure. All of a sudden, your publisher is told that not only does the former president of the United States not want this book to be written, he's not going to talk, he's not going to verify anything. Most publishers would have caved at that point. And I think Bush thought it would work. </p> <p>[S:] Let's talk about Sharon Bush - she is your only on-the-record source for the Camp David cocaine story. But she's now gone public denying she ever told it to you. Why would she do that? <br>[KK:] I don't know; my guess is she's scared. She talked about everything with me that day, mostly about the breakup of her marriage, and how the Bushes don't have family values. And she said to me that the affair that Neil had that broke up her marriage was aided and abetted by his parents, Barbara and George. </p> <p>She was crying and crying and she said, \"they let him have an affair. And I called up Barbara and threw myself on her mercy and said please, please tell him to come back home.\" And I said: \"How can his mother tell him to come back to his wife?\" And she said, \"you don't understand - they'll do anything she tells them.\" But she said her mother-in-law wouldn't do that, she was cold as ice. And she cried, \"you'd think Barbara would have been more sympathetic to me, considering all the infidelities she's had to put up with.\" </p> <p>Now over that lunch Sharon and Lou told me that she was in the midst of an alimony battle, she was angry that she was only being paid $1,000 (\u00a3557) a month alimony. And they told me they thought that if they leaked the fact she was having lunch with Kitty Kelley to the press, the Bushes hate you so much, that will scare them. And it might be leverage for her in her divorce. And Lou said: \"Well, this lunch might find its way into the New York Observer.\" And in fact it came out in the Observer the next week.</p> <p>[S:] So Sharon Bush was using you to put some heat on the family to get a better divorce deal? <br>[KK:] Yes. And I understand that. And she did get a better deal. Her alimony went up to $2,500 (\u00a31,400). So that told me something else about the Bushes and how they operate. So she got a better alimony deal out of it. But then she goes on The Today Show Monday morning to say you're wrong. That takes nerve, to go on network TV to challenge a bestselling author. </p> <p>[S:] Why would she have done that? <br>[KK:] Her kids. Her kids are in touch with her grandparents and they go, \"mom, how could you, how could you?\" I think it was pressure from her kids, coming down hard from her grandparents. Absolutely. She has three kids - one who's still a minor, Ashley, one, Pierce, who just started Georgetown University and wants to be a politician, and then she's got the model, Lauren. And I think kids are the first casualty, and they didn't ask for this and just want it all to go away. They probably love their family and are just appalled at what their mother did. And Sharon was probably at a very vulnerable time, and is not quite as vulnerable now. But she got on nationwide television and denied what she said, and I have a witness. </p> <p>[S:] Why didn't you tape it? <br>[KK:] It was in a restaurant, I never tape in them. It's loud and clattery. Also I knew it would probably be a sensitive interview. I don't tape every interview, but I have a lot on tape. </p> <p>[S:] In another explosive part of your book, you tell the story of a Midland prostitute peddling embarrassing stories about George W Bush who's suddenly run out of Austin by some threatening \"intelligence types\". You name one source for that story. Do you have others? <br>[KK:] One on record, and two unnamed sources. <br>[S:] Why didn't you name them? <br>[KK:] I don't remember why in that case.<br>[S:] With a charge like that, it seems like you'd want more than one named source. I'd also want to know if the source you named, this political consultant in Austin named Peck Young, had an axe to grind, if he was a Bush hater. What made you give that story credit?<br> [KK:] Because he was impeccable, that source, I feel very comfortable with him.<br> [S:] And you believe the Bushes are capable of doing something like that - of threatening a woman who is shooting her mouth off like that? You think the family really operates that way?<br>[KK:] I know the family operates that way. I wish you could see the stuff that's on the cutting room floor, that got left out of the book. There are other people who will tell you stories like that, but they won't go on the record. And you can't blame them. And I don't know how to convince them, that it's history, that it's important. Because I can't in good conscience tell them that. But I do feel comfortable with that story. I'm surprised by the number of people who did go on the record. </p> <p>[S:] Another inflammatory passage in the book is about the girlfriend whose abortion George W Bush allegedly paid for as a young man. There again it seems like you go with one source, and it's somebody many people don't find credible - Larry Flynt. <br>[KK:] Not just him - I relied on his two detectives.<br>[S:] So you went and interviewed them as well?<br>[KK:] Yes.<br>[S:] Again, I'm trying to figure out your methodology and why your enemies come after you and say: \"She relies on shaky sources or she'll lump a variety of sources together, no matter how they vary in credibility.\"<br> [KK:] Yes, I've read that one too.<br>[S:] So how do you respond to that - say on this one in particular, this abortion story?<br>[KK:] Well, I took the public record a little further and went to the investigators and asked for their stuff, and got their stuff. I have the woman's name, address and phone number ... <br>[S:] Did you make an effort to reach her?<br>[KK:] Of course. <br>[S:] And she wouldn't talk? <br>[KK:] No. <br>[S:] But you found the two investigators credible after talking to them? <br>[KK:] Yeah, I did. </p> <p>[S:] So your method is to leave it to the reader to make up their minds? <br> [KK:] Right. And to tell you how far I went. <br> [S:] That falls short of the standards of the New York Times, say, or the Washington Post. Why do you feel it's legitimate to fall short of that standard? <br> [KK:] I don't think that falls short of the standards of the New York Times or the Washington Post in every single instance. I think that especially the Washington Post has pushed things in the past, far beyond where I would go.<br> [S:] What's an example of that? <br> [KK:] Janet Cooke. <br>[S:] Well, that was exposed as a work of fiction! <br> [KK:] Jayson Blair ... <br>[S:] But the Times and the Post were both humiliated by those scandals. <br>[KK:] And I would be too if you find something in my books that didn't stand the test of time. I honestly would. <br>[S:]So you wouldn't have put a story like that in unless you'd done enough work on your own to satisfy yourself that there was something there, that it would hold up? <br> [KK:] Right. </p> <p>[S:] What do you think W will do if he loses in November? Will he happily go back to baseball? <br> [KK:] No. You know something that I have found out from this family after four years - he doesn't plan to lose. They know how to win - no matter what. <br> [S:] What does that mean?<br> [KK:] That means these people can put the Sopranos to shame.<br>[S:] Does that mean vote stealing? <br> [KK:] That's a bit overt. But nothing will stand in the way of these people winning. Nothing. You start out looking at the Bush family like it's The Donna Reed Show and then you see it's The Sopranos. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Talbot is Salon's founder and editor in chief</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004 <br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://salon.com\"> salon.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The scene of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today is Darfur, in western Sudan. But despite our large media window onto the world, few of our students are likely to have any great knowledge of Sudan - the largest country in Africa.</p> <p>The crisis in Darfur emanates from the longest-running civil war in Africa. There has been a history of war in Sudan's recent past, but this particular conflict began in 1983, when the Arab government in the north tried to impose Islamic sharia law throughout Sudan, including the south where the black African population follows traditional African beliefs or Christianity.</p> <p>A ceasefire and peace agreement has been agreed between the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), including a deal to split valuable oil revenues from southern oilfields.</p> <p>But this has sparked demands from rebels in Darfur for a fairer deal for the black African population there, where the differences tend to be ethnic and cultural rather than religious (the people of Darfur, whether their first language is Arabic or an African language, are traditionally Muslim).</p> <p><strong>Ethnic cleansing</strong></p> <p>The government responded by backing the Arab Janjaweed militias who have run riot, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of over 1 million people as they flee for their lives. The rest of the world has glimpsed the spectre of ethnic cleansing raising its ugly head again and, with memories of Rwanda and Kosovo still fresh, the international community does not want to be accused of a slow, ineffective response. (Last week the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, described the violence as \"genocide\".)</p> <p>A UN resolution has been passed, calling for the Sudanese government to disarm and disband the Janjaweed militias, so that humanitarian aid can be distributed effectively.</p> <p>The Sudanese government's response has been slow and reluctant. There is little evidence of effective measures to lessen the atrocities being committed by the Janjaweed. As a result, the suffering of the Sudanese refugees continues.</p> <p><strong>Odd-one-out</strong></p> <p>You can begin to find out what your students know about Sudan by playing a simple game of \"odd-one-out\".</p> <p>Put the name of Sudan on the board with the names of two other countries - ones they may be more familiar with or that have been in the news too, for example the United Kingdom, South Africa, Israel or Russia. In pairs, students should be asked to discuss the similarities and differences - geographical, economic, physical, historical, religious, etc - and should try to decide which country is the odd-one-out. Encourage them to be imaginative, inquiring and speculative in their reasoning.</p> <p>There is no right answer, of course, but the value of the exercise is to assess prior knowledge as well as stimulate their interest in finding out more.</p> <p>They can follow this up by creating a list of 10 questions about Sudan, with the opportunity to research and share the answers. The <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/\">CIA World Factbook</a> gives useful county profiles and is a good first port of call.</p> <p><strong>Deplorable conditions</strong><br></p> <p>Despite the images students may have seen on the television news, it may be difficult for students to appreciate the circumstances and suffering in Darfur. Challenge them to consider what life must be like in the refugee camps. Save the Children has described subsistence conditions as \"deplorable\".</p> <p>Encourage students to investigate the idea of what \"deplorable\" living conditions might be like. Divide the class into groups of five. Give each student one area of focus from the following list: healthcare; shelter; food and water; education; friends and family.</p> <p>Once they have been given their focus, they move into a new group - an \"expert\" group - with all the others with that focus. The students can discuss the problems associated with their area of focus before moving back to their original groups to share their findings and create a picture - in image or words - of how life might be in the refugee camps.</p> <p><strong>Children caught in conflict</strong><br></p> <p>Save the Children, one of many aid agencies operational in Darfur, is working hard to provide basic necessities such as food, water and healthcare in camps such as Abu Shok in north Darfur. Out of 40,000 people in the camp, three-quarters are children. Students might be helped to understand something of the children's situation by reading individual experiences. Save the Children cites the case of Setcania, a six-year-old child who walked 60km to Abu Shok to escape violence.</p> <p>Setcania, like most children at the camp, enjoys the prospect of school: \"School is what we most want.\"</p> <p>There are 11 schools for the 30,000 children in Abu Shok. As well as discussing whether they value education like Setcania does, your students might want to do a little basic maths on the numbers involved, and to discuss the problems of education in the camp.</p> <p>Encourage them to research other case studies, and to look at first-hand accounts in newspapers and on charity websites.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links and guidance</strong></p> <p><strong>This lesson is written for KS3 (age 11-14) but can be adapted for other ages</strong></p> <p><strong>Key stage 2</strong><br></p> <p>Introduce the geography of Sudan with a map game. Arrange students in groups of four and challenge them to draw an accurate map of Sudan from memory. In each group, each child should be numbered one to four. First invite the \"ones\" to your table and show them a map of Sudan (with a bold outline and main features, eg towns, mountain ranges, Blue Nile, White Nile). Give them 30 seconds to study the map, then ask them to return to their group and spend two minutes drawing as much of the map as they remember. Invite the \"twos\" to your desk and repeat the process, until all the students have done some of the drawing. Adjust the timings and the demands to suit the needs of your group. Encourage students to appreciate the size of the country (Sudan is roughly the same size as western Europe) and to find out more about Sudan, eg the size of its population (40m), climate and resources, flag. See the <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/\">CIA World Factbook</a> for a useful country profile.</p> <p><strong>Key stage 4</strong></p> <p>The question of interference in the affairs in other countries is topical, particularly after the war in Iraq. Discuss whether it is ever right for a country or countries to intervene because they don't like what is happening in another country. Have a class vote.</p> <p>Then discuss what actions countries can take, for instance military intervention or economic, political or social sanctions. In what circumstances might such interventions be acceptable? Look at examples, eg South Africa, Cuba, Chile, Afghanistan.</p> <p>Now turn to Sudan and ask if there should be any international action. Explain the role the UN has in deciding whether to take action, and the difficulty of gaining unanimous support for action (the resolution calling for Sudan's government to halt the atrocities was only passed after the word \"sanctions\" was dropped, and both China and Pakistan abstained).</p> <p>Finally, put the students into groups and give each group member a role - for example aid worker, refugee, member of the Sudanese government, person from a neighbouring country - and debate the issues. Research time would help.</p> <p>Finally, repeat your class vote, to see if opinions have changed.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links</strong></p> <p><strong>KS2</strong><br> <strong>English</strong> En1 2a-; En2 2a-d, 3a-d,5e <br><strong>Geography</strong> 1a-c, 2a-g, 3a-f <br><strong>PSHE and Citizenship</strong> 2a,e,k 4b <br><strong>Citizenship at key stages 1 and 2</strong> Unit 05: Living in a diverse world <br><strong>Geography at key stages 1 and 2</strong> Unit 16: What's in the news?; Unit 24: Passport to the world</p> <p><strong>KS3</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a,b, f-i, 2a-c, 3a-c <br><strong>English</strong> En1 1a-g, 2a-f, 3a-e; En2 1a-e, 4a-d, 5a-d; En3 1g-h <br><strong>Geography</strong> 1 d-e, 2 c-e, 3a-e <br><strong>PSHE</strong> 3a,b <br><strong>Citizenship at key stage 3</strong> Unit 03: Human rights; Unit 11: Why is it so difficult to keep the peace in the world today?; Unit 13: How do we deal with conflict? <br><strong>Geography at key stage 3</strong> (Year 8) Unit 12: Images of a country; (Year 9) Unit 20: Comparing countries</p> <p><strong>KS4</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a,b, f, g, j, 2a-c, 3a-c <br><strong>English</strong> En1 1a-g, 2a-f, 3a-e En2 1a-e, 4a-d, 5a-d <br><strong>PSHE</strong> 3a-c <br><strong>Citizenship at key stage 4</strong> Unit 01: Human rights <br><strong>Scottish Curriculum 5-14</strong><br> <strong>English language levels</strong> C-F <br><strong>Environmental studies</strong> C-F</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/\">www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/</a><br> Useful country profiles</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.un.org/ \">www.un.org/</a><br> The United Nations, which calls for the militias to be disbanded</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\">www.savethechildren.org.uk/</a><br> Case studies, explanations and reports from aid workers in Sudan</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sudan/\">www.theguardian.com/sudan/</a><br> A Guardian special report</p> <p><strong>Resources on learnpremium.co.uk</strong></p> <p>Students can find out more about Sudan on <a href=\"http://www.learnpremium.co.uk\">learnpremium.co.uk</a>, the Guardian's subscription-based website for schools.

  "<p>If you're heading off to university, you'll need to set yourself up with a student account. And because you'll be working and playing hard, with little time to spend on your finances, you'll probably stick with the account you open now for the duration of your course.</p> <p>With that in mind, it makes sense to shop around for the best deals. And there are plenty of banks and building societies competing for your business. Here are some of the student packages on offer. </p> <p>All accounts offer telephone and internet banking and it's worth remembering that all overdrafts and credit offers are subject to status. Don't go assuming you can borrow up to the whole limit without asking, or you'll get stung with unauthorised borrowing charges, which cost plenty. </p> <p><strong>HSBC student service</strong></p> <p> This bank offers a cheque book and a Maestro debit card. Interest paid while you're in credit is low at 0.10%. The free overdraft limits go up to \u00a31,000 in the first year, \u00a31,250 for second years, \u00a31,500 in the third year, \u00a31,750 in the fourth year and \u00a32,000 in the fifth year of study. </p> <p>The overdraft is automatic as you apply for it when opening the account. And unauthorised overdrafts are fee and interest-free for students (usually 14.8%APR), which is highly unusual, although this isn't meant to encourage unauthorised borrowing.

  "<p>The 2004 hurricane season is expected to be costly for insurers, with early estimates of $8bn (\u00a34.5bn) of losses from just one of the storms that have hit the United States this year. </p> <p>The estimate by Aon does not include the impact of Hurricane Ivan, which was last night expected to hit Cuba after rampaging through Jamaica over the weekend before entering the Gulf of Mexico tomorrow. </p> <p>Shell was shutting down productions in the gulf as a precaution yesterday and oil prices were rising on fears that damage could lead to sustained reduced production. </p> <p>Nicholas Bollons, a catastrophe analyst at Aon, estimates that Hurricane Charley, which hit Florida in August, will lead to $5bn to $8bn of losses alone for insurers. Three million people were evacuated to avoid Charley but 25 lost their lives. </p> <p>Mr Bollons had expected 2004 to be worse than average because the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had forecast up to 15 tropical storms with up to eight hurricanes, two to four of which would be severe. </p> <p>On average there are five to six hurricanes a year. Hurricane Alex was the first of 2004, followed by Charley and Frances in mid-September. Ivan is still raging and was not included in Aon's research. </p> <p>Aon has kept track of all the national disasters that have taken place to the end of August and identified more than 8,000 fatalities, with 355 of these being in August. </p> <p>The statistics do not just cover hurricanes but also monitor avalanches, fires, volcanic activity and earthquakes - like the one measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale which hit Turkey last month. </p> <p>Most of the analysis for August, however, focuses on hurricanes and finds that as the season is not due to end until November, the price could be high for insurers. </p> <p>Together, though, the hurricanes are not thought likely to surpass the $30bn of damage inflicted by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which resulted in insurer losses of $16bn. </p> <p>In any natural disaster not all the damage suffered will be covered by policies - which is why insurers attempt to estimate losses. But Mr Bollons noted: \"With an increase in economic and insured assets in coastal areas due to population growth and increased affluence, damage from hurricanes and tropical storms is likely to continue.\" </p> <p>The increase in hurricane activity in 2004 may be part of a longer-term trend. Aon cited research by William Gray, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, who has found that the cycle of increased activity could last another 10 or 20 years. </p> <p>Hurricanes are fuelled by warm ocean waters; on average temperatures have been half a degree warmer than in the early 1990s. </p> <p>The Atlantic warmed up between 1926 and 1960, when there was increased activity, but hurricanes reduced between 1960 and 1995, when the water was cooler.</p>",
  "As ever, before the TUC speech, I'm not short of advice. The difference this year is that I agree with it. Some have told me not to break the agreement at the Warwick Policy Forum in July. Some, notably Brendan, have said it's time to come out in favour of social partnership, not be embarrassed about it. All have told me not to lose touch with the concerns of the hard-working families it's our and my duty to represent. <p>So I come here to praise Warwick not bury it. To advocate social partnership not belittle it. And above all to demonstrate that our and my priority is and always will be the lives, living standards and quality of life of Britain's hard-working families, the men and women who play by the rules and expect others to do the same; who worry about the bills and the mortgage and making ends meet; who struggle with the modern burden of work and family life, and don't ask for or expect miracles just a fair chance to make the most of life for them and their children.</p> <p>I frankly admit that too many people look at the past few years and see how the political and media agenda has been dominated by nothing but foreign affairs. Now there's all sorts of explanations I can give. The world agenda since September 11th 2001 has been different. Different for the leaders that have stood by America since then. Different for the leaders that haven't, but dominant for both.</p> <p>I can't apologise for what I think about the world since September 11th or what I have done in the war against this vicious terrorism we face. That would be insincere and dishonest.</p> <p>But vital though that war is, the daily lives of our citizens here in Britain are not about foreign affairs. It's interest rates, the workplace, taxes and bills, schools and hospitals, crime and ASB. Their stage is not the world; it's here on our streets, our towns, villages and cities.</p> <p>Yet even at the height of the crises of the last three years - since I stood here in this hall on 11 September and spoke about this new form of terrorism our world faces - we have never stopped working on that domestic, bread and butter, real life agenda.</p> <p>But I acknowledge it hasn't seemed like that. I have never been away from those issues that make daily life good or bad for our people. But too many people watching the news every night might think I have. And if I can put it like this: even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back. </p> <p>The best way of doing that is to prove it by action.</p> <p>Over the weekend I got out the first speech I ever made to a Labour Party Conference not as leader but as Employment spokesman back in 1990. I said: a Labour Government would introduce a minimum wage; a legal right to union recognition; sign the Social Chapter; restore trade union rights at GCHQ; improve maternity leave; introduce paid holidays; end blacklisting; and remove the power of automatic dismissal for those lawfully on strike.</p> <p>We have done every one of those things. But we only did them by being in Government not in permanent Opposition.</p> <p>There is another thing I want to remind you about that period. The name of my opposite number in the Tory Cabinet that gave us mass unemployment, soaring interest rates, and the poll tax. You may remember him. Mr Michael Howard.</p> <p>And I've told you what I said in 1990.</p> <p>Let me tell you what he said in 1990.</p> <p>That the minimum wage would cost 1 million jobs.</p> <p>That the social chapter would cost another half million.</p> <p>He was talking nonsense then. He talks nonsense now.</p> <p>And if we want to keep our economy strong, we need to keep Mr Howard in Opposition.</p> <p>None of this - not the economic strength, not the legislation to correct injustice at work, came through chance, but through choice. The choice you made was not to make demands you knew won't be met; nor to hark back to the past; but to understand economic stability had to be the irreducible bedrock of economic opportunity and social progress.</p> <p>Seven years on, our long-term interest rates are the lowest for 25 years, matching continental levels. Employment has risen steadily without generating inflation. Economic growth is currently the highest in the G8 with 29 quarters of consecutive growth since 1997. The public finances are in good shape. Immense productivity challenges remain, but the foundations of future prosperity are being laid. </p> <p>And the difference we have made to the living standards of hard-working families since we came to office is crystal clear. Average monthly mortgage payments are \u00a3400 less under this government than under the Conservatives. Property repossessions, so devastating during the late 1980s, are now at a historic low. Families are far better off with living standards growing by a fifth since 1996/97. The average working family with children is \u00a31350 a year better off in real terms since Labour came to power. The poorest fifth are over \u00a33000 a year better off in real terms. </p> <p>It's a clear reminder that economic stability is for a purpose - to create a fairer, more prosperous society with decent provision for the least advantaged, and world-class public services for all.</p> <p>Full employment has transformed regions of the country left behind in the Eighties. Across Britain's cities, City centres and riversides that had become drab, empty at night, are now vibrant. Derelict factories and empty warehouses have been converted into new homes and businesses providing the jobs of the future. Britain is working, its economy now one of the most dynamic and competitive in the world. </p> <p>We are the only major nation in the world that for the last two years and the next two will be increasing public investment in healthcare and education as a percentage of national income. The only one.</p> <p>Alongside that 700,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. Almost two million pensioners relieved from acute hardship. And there has been record help for poorer families through childcare benefit, tax credits and family support.</p> <p>So when I hear people saying we should pursue Labour policies not Tory ones, I say what could be more Labour than record jobs, record investment in the NHS and millions lifted out of poverty.</p> <p>And yet you don't continue to govern on the basis of your record but on the basis of your vision of the future.</p> <p>The truth is modern life for many of our people is tough. There are jobs but they are often insecure. There are still too many people who are sick and disabled who would like to work, but don't have the opportunity to do so. The minimum wage may give some protection but it's hard to raise a family on it. Years ago, if you talked of pensions, you meant pensioners. Today, there is real anxiety amongst those of working age as to how to save for their retirement. More women work than ever before but balancing work and family life is a struggle and equal pay still an aspiration not a reality for millions of women.</p> <p>And what's more, even if people are in work, reasonably secure, comfortably off, the economy they work in is part of a world market that has never seen such revolutionary changes in technology, in consumer tastes, and in the scale of competition. China and India each with well over one billion people mean that every European nation no longer competes today only with America and Japan, let alone only each other.</p> <p>So how do we - us in Government, you in trade unions and in business - help our people cope with change, survive it and prosper in it?</p> <p>When I opened recently one of the many new community centres in the former coalfields in the North East, there was a union banner. It featured a picture of Peter Lee, who in 1869 founded the miners' union in the Durham Coalfield. The union was formed to break the virtual serfdom with which the coal owners ruled those that worked for them. The union successfully fought for miners' rights. In time, in Durham alone over 120 collieries employed 150,000 men. But the union did more than fight for them at the workplace. It founded mutual societies to provide them with help for medical care and pensions. It looked after legal claims and families bereaved. The unions stood for solidarity not only at work, but also through life.</p> <p>No one works in the mines of Durham today. The whole economy of the North East is new. The jobs are new. The way of life is new. Within a few years of the mines closing, Fujitsu, one of the great Japanese hopes of inward investment, had set up its factory in my constituency and closed it again when the microchip market collapsed. The process of change is constant. </p> <p>So the issue for trade unions is the same as for the rest of us: how to adapt to change, to keep principles intact whilst the reality in which they exist, has been transformed. </p> <p>Once before, you took a decision to put aside the past in order to equip the Labour Party to govern successfully. Today, I ask you - as social partners to do the same - to help the country succeed.</p> <p>This to me is the significance of what was agreed at Warwick. </p> <p>There can be no return to the industrial relations framework of the 1970s, no move away from the enterprise and dynamism a modern economy needs. We cannot and will not reverse the programme of change and modernisation that together with record investment is delivering public services combining equity with choice and excellence. </p> <p>Union members are not just workers. They use the NHS. They need good state schools for their children. And they know that the welfare state of 2004 not 1945 has to be one that re-distributes opportunity not merely pays more out in benefit.</p> <p>These changes as much as the money are allowing us to cut dramatically the waiting time for operations; make sure, for example that no London Borough now has pass rates of under 40 per cent for GSCEs, up from 25 per cent in 1997; and make long-term youth unemployment literally disappear. This is not selling out; it is paying back, reducing inequality, extending opportunity, giving hope.</p> <p>Warwick should be seen not as diluting the changes we have made but conditioning them with one very basic set of principles at its heart: good jobs don't come with bad work practices; successful employers don't succeed by abusing their employees; quality public services don't achieve excellence by undervaluing public servants.</p> <p>In other words, our belief is that the more we value, invest in, understand and resolve the dilemmas of those that produce the wealth and services of our nation, in the modern world, the more likely we are to have the future we desire.</p> <p>What does this mean in practice?</p> <p>First, let us be clear. For Britain to prosper and thrive in the future, we need a vibrant modern manufacturing sector, just as much as a powerful service sector, and world-class public services. </p> <p>Manufacturing in the UK has gone through a difficult time as it has in every developed country in the world. There are real successes: pharmaceuticals and aerospace, or ICT and the biotechnology industry; truly world-class enterprises, of which any country should be proud. </p> <p>Britain's car industry - once thought to be in terminal decline - has been reinvigorated, gaining a new lease of life. </p> <p>Nissan in Sunderland is the most productive car plant in Europe, last month producing the millionth Nissan for the UK market. The new MINI built at Cowley is a runway success with half a million cars now coming off the production line, and the sector as a whole is now the UK's largest source of manufactured exports. </p> <p>But there is a huge amount to do. We will continue to see how investment in technology, the tax system for capital investment, and help for businesses to grow can benefit manufacturing.</p> <p>And in every region, each RDA is now working up a strategy to build on the particular strengths of its manufacturing enterprises. </p> <p>This Government now set to make the largest sustained investment in science for a generation, \u00a33 billion a year. Such a commitment means modernised labs, better pay for researchers, new research programmes at the cutting edge of human knowledge. </p> <p>Let me also make it absolutely clear that the Government is determined to protect research staff facing daily threats of intimidation and violence from animal rights extremists and will bring forward legislation to ensure this.</p> <p>Second, Warwick signifies that skills, once a social cause - are now an economic imperative. </p> <p>Britain will not succeed if over a third of its workforce lacks basic qualifications. </p> <p>We've started by creating a new framework for skills and are on course to meet our 2007 target to help 1.5 million adults get basic skills and qualifications. We're also working with the TUC on the proposals for a TUC Academy to take the skills agenda even further. </p> <p>Since 1998, we've invested \u00a335 million in the Trade Union Learning fund, and put Union Learning Reps on a statutory footing. We want to treble these numbers by 2010. </p> <p>Education Maintenance Allowances have been extended to every 16-19 year from a low-income background remaining in full-time education. We are extending the offer of free tuition for those without level 2 qualifications to every worker. And we are now examining whether it is possible to extend financial support to those seeking Level 3 qualifications for 19-30 year olds which with the other changes would represent the biggest expansion in access to skills for half a century.</p> <p>In over a third of the country, we are now piloting employer training schemes.</p> <p>We have expanded Modern Apprenticeships from 70,000 to 200,000 but I can tell you today we are now aiming at 300,000 modern apprenticeships by the end of 2006. </p> <p>Next, because there is today, rightly, far greater interaction between public, private and voluntary sectors to deliver public services, we have agreed a new deal to tackle the two-tier workforce. </p> <p>In local government, we have already acted to end the 'two-tier' workforce. At Warwick, we made the commitment to end it across the public sector; and we will fulfil that commitment. </p> <p>In some workplaces, there is a long hours culture regardless of whether it is productive. We have introduced a right for people to choose not to work more than 48 hours, and an entitlement for the first time to four weeks paid holiday a year. We are committed to ensuring that people are able to exercise a genuine choice about the hours they work. </p> <p>And let me repeat the commitment we made at Warwick that in a third term, the Labour Government will extend the paid holiday entitlement, so that the four-weeks is always an addition to eight days of public holiday. </p> <p>Our new family friendly law means that employers are now required to consider seriously requests from parents with children under six - or disabled children under 18 - to work flexibly. Nearly one million parents have taken advantage of the new law, and have applied for a change in working hours. Eight out of ten requests have been accepted in full. </p> <p>It is not right that mothers or fathers are refused time off to see their sick child through a hospital operation, the right to time off when a family member is ill. </p> <p>So we want to build on what's so far been achieved. </p> <p>We've made a commitment to our social partners not to introduce any changes before 2006. But the time is right to start thinking about the next steps. In particular, we will examine how we can extend this right to flexible working to the growing numbers of citizens who have caring responsibilities for the elderly and disabled. </p> <p>From the spring of next year, employees will have new rights to Information and Consultation at work, not preventing necessary change at work, but ensuring employees are treated as partners in that change.</p> <p>We will we act to root out abuse at the very bottom of the labour market where working people are most vulnerable. The Government will support Jim Sheridan MP's Private Member's Bill to curb exploitative activities among agricultural gang masters. We will improve protection for migrant workers, strengthening measures against employers who seek to exploit them. It is neither fair for those who are exploited, nor for those firms who do play by the rules when a few rogue employers are able to get away with ignoring the law.</p> <p>You know our concerns on agency workers to maintain necessary labour market flexibility. But whilst we must meet those concerns, we will support the EU Directive on Agency Workers.</p> <p>And we'll ensure greater safety for front-line workers in retailing, transport, and the public services, those who working to help others, face the constant daily threat of violence and anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>We will publish proposals on corporate manslaughter in the current parliamentary session, and introduce legislation to ensure that corporations are prosecuted for a serious criminal offence where they show such wilful disregard for their employees that it results in death. </p> <p>Finally, building on Barbara Castle's Equal Pay Act, Margaret Prosser's Women and Work Commission will enable us to ensure that in our generation, we close the gap in pay and opportunity between men and women at the workplace. </p> <p>This is not an agenda about flying pickets, secondary action or the closed shop. Leave the past to the past. But it is an agenda that if carried through, will radically improve the lives of Britain's hard working and hard-pressed families. </p> <p>Work with us to get these changes. Help us to fashion them in a way that most benefits your members, actual and prospective. Make a reality of the social partnership with sensible forward-looking employers who share the belief that efficiency and fairness go hand in hand.</p> <p>Trade unions have a past of which they are rightly proud. Today they are reaching out to the future. In the public services, \"Agenda for Change\" in the NHS, the \"Schools Workforce Reform\" programme in education mean radical change in the way services will operate, but they are changes not just supported but in many cases, shaped by constructive union participation.</p> <p>Across the private sector, unions like Amicus at Rolls Royce, UNIFI at Royal Bank of Scotland, CWU at Alliance &amp; Leicester have protected or enhanced company pension schemes in imaginative ways to keep their members. The GMB, GPMU, and TGWU are now actively involved all over Britain in setting up skills and learning centres with the help of the Government's Modernisation Fund. The Shop workers Union is not just increasing members but taking the lead, where the employer is in difficulty in helping the company change, restructure and prosper.</p> <p>One final area for work: pensions. There is no easy solution. The blunt truth is that the population is ageing; people live longer; and yet want, unsurprisingly, the higher living standards they experienced while working, to continue into retirement. We need to get the balance right between what the State ie the taxpayer, the individual and employer each contribute; and we need to get the system right to facilitate that contribution. But one thing I can say to you: the Basic State Pension and guarantees against pensioner poverty will always be an essential part of our solution to this issue; and you in the Trade unions should be, along with business and industry, part of the partnership to get it right.</p> <p>Those who said unions could never adapt to the challenge of the new economy and its changes are being proved wrong. Of course, wherever there is the possibility of industrial disputes, those capture the headlines. But the true face of modern trade unionism is not to be found in the exception of industrial breakdown, but in the broad rule of social partnership and progress.</p> <p>We won't go back to the agenda of the past. But there is much for us now to do on the new agenda and do it together. To people at work, wondering whether membership of a trade union has anything to offer them, I would say: go and see. See what a modern trade union can do; see the breadth of services they provide; see the help in troubled times they can give; and if you want to, join.</p> <p>And in doing so, join us in building on the record of the past few years to seek new ambitions, new heights to scale, new ways to work, live and prosper.</p> <p>I go back to that 1990 speech. I said then: \"These are the forward-looking priorities we shall establish by our historic decisions today. The British people can now be clear. It is the Tories, not us, who believe that industrial relations is merely industrial warfare, arcane endless legal disputes about strikes and pickets as if the field of employment were merely a field of battle. It is they who are unable to escape the politics of conflict and grasp the potential for partnership. It is they who embrace the agenda of the 70s and 80s because they have no answer to the problems of the future. Let them: leave the past to those who live in it. This party belongs in the future and we can address that future with confidence and hope.\"</p> <p>It was true 14 years ago. It remains true now.</p>",
  "<p>There is nothing like the sound of an African church on a Sunday morning, and even in Soweto, back in the apartheid era, the hymns and gospel songs thundering out across the shacks and slums provided an exhilarating reminder of the community's beliefs and defiance. </p> <p>Ten years on from Majority Rule, the Soweto Gospel Choir set out to revive that spirit and celebrate the anniversary of their independence. But they did so in a performance that was aimed squarely at the mass market in the west. </p> <p>This 27-piece choir specialises not just in gospel but in African pop spectacle. They came on wearing brightly coloured costumes, which were changed several times during the show, and at times concentrated as much on their high-kicking dance routines and bursts of comedy as they did on the music. </p> <p>The choir started promisingly enough with a nod to the classic township styles of the Manhattan Brothers, followed by a series of cheerful traditional songs, and then a rousing treatment of two of the best white protest songs from the apartheid era, Johnny Clegg's Asimbonanga and Peter Gabriel's Biko. After that, they played it safe. There were pleasant, if unremarkable, versions of Amazing Grace and Wimoweh, while a potentially intriguing treatment of Jimmy Cliff's Many Rivers to Cross was sabotaged by the decision to use some of the singers as a mundane backing band, playing guitars and keyboards. In the second half, a lament for migrant workers was equally marred by some mawkish theatrics. </p> <p>Once they included a burst of the Joseph Shabalala and Paul Simon hit, Homeless, comparison with that other highly commercial South African massed choir, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, was inevitable. For, try as they might, the Soweto choir cannot match the spine-tingling harmonies of Mambazo at their best. The singers did eventually persuade the audience to get up from their seats, but only by singing the South African national anthem. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> At the Hawth, Crawley, tonight.

  "Normally, a giant explosion that sends a mushroom cloud high into the sky would not be counted as good news. But the explanation by the North Korean authorities that last week's mysterious blast was caused by demolition work for a hydroelectric dam is far less alarming than what was briefly feared: a test of the nuclear weapon the secretive Stalinist state is believed to be developing. Happily, there is no evidence of a nuclear detonation, though some of the experts who monitor the \"hermit kingdom\" believe that Pyongyang's official admission may conceal an accident in a closed military-industrial zone on the remote border with China. <p>Others suggest whatever happened could have been deliberate, citing the fact that it took place on September 9, the date of North Korea's foundation. The way the regime seals itself off from the outside has often encouraged rumour, as was the case with a massive train crash earlier this year. Whatever the truth, this episode is a troubling reminder of the big issue that rightly worries the entire world. Having admitted two years ago that it had the know-how to develop nuclear weapons, North Korea is still refusing to resume stalled talks with South Korea, Japan, China, Russia and the US, although it has been able to exploit reports that Seoul has experimented with plutonium enrichment. </p> <p>International aid to the victims of famine and the train disaster has not persuaded the leadership to change tack, despite internal reforms and signs it wants to improve its dire international image. Other changes may be needed to achieve a breakthrough. At the weekend, John Kerry launched an attack on George Bush for breaking with the Clinton administration's policy of direct engagement with Kim Jong-il, and then for being so preoccupied by Iraq that he has let a \"nuclear nightmare\" develop in the country he famously included in his \"axis of evil\". Americans worry about an \"October surprise\" in the run-up to presidential elections. But mountains that go bang in the night make people nervous far beyond the Washington Beltway.</p>",
  "There is one thing on which both sides agree: hunting is not a class issue. The hunters claim that it's no longer the preserve of the aristocracy. Labour MPs insist that their determination to ban it has nothing to do with the social order: it's about animals. Both sides are wrong. This is class war. <p>The Countryside Alliance, the Telegraph, the Field, and Horse and Hound magazine maintain that opposition to foxhunting is the newfangled concern of the dilettantes of Islington, who know nothing of the countryside. The hunters plainly know nothing of history. </p> <p>To the Normans, England was one big hunting ground. By the time of Henry II's reign, according to the author Marion Shoard, almost a quarter of the country was royal forest. A forest is not a place where trees grow. It is land set aside for the king's game, in which the nourishment of deer, wild swine and hares took precedence over the nourishment of human beings. Much of the rest of England was classified as \"chase\": the hunting grounds of the nobility. </p> <p>These lands were governed by a brutal set of forest laws. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William I \"set up great protection for deer and legislated to that intent, that whosoever should slay hart or hind should be blinded\". In 1293, the historian Andrew McCall tells us, \"the English parliament decreed that no proceedings were to be taken against foresters, parkers or warreners if they killed poachers who resisted arrest\". A poacher, subsequent laws determined, was anyone who wasn't a nob. In 1390, parliament \"passed an act limiting the right to hunt to the 40-shilling freeholder for laymen, and to the cleric with an annual income of over \u00a310\". </p> <p>These laws, Shoard says, \"helped establish two basic principles of land management that ... persist to this day. The first was that facilitating the private pleasure of the privileged few was a legitimate basis for determining the allocation of Britain's land. The second was that the landowner possessed the right to do whatever he liked with his land irrespective of the impact ... on other members of the community.\" </p> <p>Not everyone who hunts today is a member of the aristocracy - far from it. But this is the way in which you aspire to become one. To look posh you buy a Land Rover, green wellies, a tweed hat and a waxed jacket: the livery of field sports. You buy a house in the country. You get yourself a horse and you join the hunt. </p> <p>The residual power of the landed class arises from other people's aspirations. The British remain mesmerised by our pre-democratic rulers. Their version of the past is still widely accepted, thanks to costume dramas, the National Trust, and our balmoralised popular histories. It is encapsulated in the justifying myth of landed power we call chivalry. </p> <p>Chivalry embodied five romantic virtues, of which perhaps the most important was \"franchise\". Franchise is defined by the historian Maurice Keen as \"the free and frank bearing that is visible testimony to the combination of good birth with virtue\". It can also be translated as freedom from democratic restraint. </p> <p>\"Chivalry\" is derived from chevalerie, or horse soldiery. It was designed to instil in young noblemen the qualities required to conquer new lands and subjugate their people on behalf of the king and the church. These men, according to Ramon Lull, author of the 13th-century Libre del Ordre de Cavayleria, should exercise by hunting the hart, the boar and the wolf. This enabled them to refine the art of killing from the saddle with the bow and couched lance. </p> <p>In the thunder of the hunt today we hear echoes of the joust, the tourney and the cavalry charge. As if to remind us of its military associations, the hunters wear the uniform of the 18th-century soldier. And though not all redcoats are aristocrats, it is the noblesse and the classes abutting it who still run the show. </p> <p>You doubt this? Then read the letter sent to his old school magazine by the financial director of the Countryside Alliance, a man called RS Loodmer. Loodmer is an Old Stoic, which means he attended an expensive public school in Buckinghamshire called Stowe. </p> <p>\"In the build up to the Countryside March in London last year,\" he writes, \"there were five people present in our operations room at Kennington Road early one morning - I realised that we were ALL Old Stoics! ... I developed my feeling for the countryside at Stowe, and it is great that others share the same commitment and passions.\" </p> <p>I read this because I am also an Old Stoic. I too \"developed my feeling for the countryside at Stowe\", and for the kind of people who run it. The school, which occupies the magnificent Palladian home of Lord Cobham, was obsessed by bloodsports. It had its own pack of beagles. There were lakes in which many of us fished. Several of the boys owned ferrets, and quite a few had guns hidden in their studies. </p> <p>I remember being astonished by the arsenal of shotguns, rifles, pistols and air rifles which appeared one frozen dawn when we gathered by the lakes to flick bottles across the ice and shoot them. One boy used to delight in releasing a squirrel and two ferrets in the squash courts. He later became master of one of Britain's most famous hunts, which is inconvenient for those who claim that hunting has nothing to do with sadism. </p> <p>I saw it from both sides: as a member of the chivalric order and as one excluded from it. At home, I used to join the local boys in \"running down\" the hunt. This is the only traditionally working-class component of foxhunting: the fit young men of the village work out where the horses are going and, taking short cuts, try to get there before them. This way you could enjoy the thrill of the chase without the expense of owning a horse. The hunters tolerated us, but that was all. At the meet they would remain in the saddle, drinking from their stirrup-cups, talking only to each other. If we asked one of them a question, he would ignore us, or address us as if a worm had spoken, or walk his horse straight through us, so that we had to step out of the way. </p> <p>The Norman lords' superiority, Shoard writes, was established by two features of feudal society: the castle and their \"association ... with the horse, which enabled them literally to look down on the serfs, who walked\". </p> <p>As an animal welfare issue, foxhunting comes in at about number 155. It probably ranks below the last of the great working-class bloodsports, coarse fishing. It's insignificant beside intensive pig farming, chicken keeping or even the rearing of pheasants for driven shoots. But as a class issue, it ranks behind private schooling at number two. This isn't about animal welfare. It's about human welfare. By taking on the hunt, our MPs are taking on those who ran the country for 800 years, and still run the countryside today. This class war began with the Norman conquest. It still needs to be fought. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>"
