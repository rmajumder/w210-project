  "When the musicians and singers of the first Motown Revue - the Miracles, the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, \"Little\" Stevie Wonder and Earl Van Dyke and the Soul Brothers - disembarked at London airport for their first British tour in the spring of 1965, the hand stretching out to greet them was that of Dave Godin, the leading light of the Tamla Motown Appreciation Society, founded the previous year. Godin, who has died at the age of 68, was then, as he remained for the rest of his life, Britain's most effective propagandist on behalf of soul music. <p>Godin did not coin that term, but he did come up with the epithets that adhered to two of its most distinctive variants: deep soul, which describes the idiom at its most emotionally intense, and northern soul, encapsulating the fast, urgent style beloved by dancers at clubs such as Wigan Casino, Blackpool Mecca and other venues north of the Trent. His knowledge and enthusiasm made him into something of an arbiter when it came to disputes over artistic authenticity within a field abounding in purists of all persuasions.</p> <p>As a journalist, record company adviser, record shop owner and even, briefly, owner of his own labels devoted to the African-American music he considered a pinnacle of 20th-century culture, his influence was out of all proportion both to his limited fame and to the rewards he received. In recent years, however, four volumes of a series called Dave Godin's Deep Soul Treasures created renewed interest in the music he loved with such a profound and enduring passion. Selling in unexpectedly healthy quantities, they helped create a new and younger audience for such gifted but long-neglected artists as Doris Duke, Bessie Banks, Irma Thomas, the Knight Brothers and the Soul Children.</p> <p>There was more to Godin than a love of music, however. A militant atheist, a conscientious objector who argued his way out of national service, a vegetarian from the age of 14, a campaigner against cruelty to animals and cinema censorship, he abhorred violence and believed in fairness in all areas of human conduct. His support for America's civil rights movement underpinned his belief that blues and soul music gained their special force from the social and historical context in which they were created. </p> <p>To him, the fact that he introduced Mick Jagger to black music was probably the least interesting thing he did in his life. Idolising the original performers, he was aghast when Jagger, a school acquaintance, and a group of friends appropriated the music and sold it back to American audiences. To Godin, this represented the ultimate betrayal of the music and the people who had invented it. \"We were working on behalf of black America,\" he told the writer Jon Savage many years later, \"and it seemed that they were working on behalf of themselves.\"</p> <p>Born in Peckham three years before the outbreak of the second world war and raised in Lambeth, he moved with his family to Bexleyheath when the activities of the Luftwaffe made their south London street uninhabitable. A milkman's son, he won a scholarship to Dartford Grammar School, where he met the young Jagger and witnessed the birth of the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>Ruth Brown's Mama He Treats Your Daughter Mean, heard on a juke box in an ice-cream parlour in the straitlaced world of 1950s Britain, was his own introduction to the emotional directness of black music. Reading Norman Jopling's erudite reviews in the Record Mirror and listening to Salut Les Copains on Europe 1 provided further evidence of the existence of music that made contemporary white pop music sound anaemic and trivial.</p> <p> A fter starting his working life as a junior in an advertising agency, he spent two years working in a hospital in lieu of national service. But music was assuming an increasing importance, and he knew he was not alone when his letter to Record Mirror, complaining about their failure to review a Bo Diddley LP, attracted correspondence from other R&amp;B fans. \"I suppose it's like being gay,\" he said. \"Everybody thinks they're the only gay person in the world until they realise there's more out there.\"</p> <p>A column in a new magazine, Home Of The Blues, gave him an audience, but the seal of approval arrived in 1964, when Berry Gordy Jr, the founder of the fledgling Motown empire, flew him to Detroit, threw a star-studded party to welcome him, and offered him a job as the company's consultant in Britain. It was Godin who pressed Gordy and EMI, their British licensee, to raise the label's profile by creating a Tamla Motown label, on which releases by the Supremes, Four Tops, Temptations and others gradually became a presence in the British charts.</p> <p>In 1968, he founded Soul City, a record shop which began in Deptford High Street and later moved to Monmouth Street in the west end of London. Soul City was also the name of the first of his two independent record labels, on which he released such classics as Go Now by Bessie Banks, the original (and vastly superior) version of a song that gave the Moody Blues their first British hit.</p> <p>When Home Of The Blues mutated into Blues And Soul, Godin's column became even more influential. Whether unearthing obscure waxings, exposing frauds or simply namechecking ordinary fans, he imbued his prose with the flavour of true obsession. \"The recent death of 'Flash' Atkinson,\" he once wrote, \"will be felt by many for a long time. One of the real, true characters on the soul scene, he will not have died in vain if it saves one life by remembering never to take a record player into the bathroom with you.\" Each column ended with the rallying cry: \"Keep the faith - right on now!\"</p> <p>In the 1970s he moved north, taking a degree at Sheffield University and later becoming the first director of the Anvil arts cinema. Generous in his enthusiasms but unsparing in his judgements, he once said of David Blunkett, a Sheffield acquaintance, \"That man always had a whiff of Stalin about him.\"</p> <p>Along with Guy Stevens, DJ at London's Scene club, Vicki Wickham, the producer of Ready Steady Go, and the pirate radio DJ Mike Raven, Dave Godin helped create the wave of enthusiasm that made soul music a vital part of British youth culture in the 1960s and 1970s. The 100 tracks contained within the four volumes of Deep Soul Treasures remain as a permanent memorial to the success of his self-appointed mission, for which many have cause to be grateful.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Dave Godin, journalist, activist, arts cinema director; born June 31 1936; died October 15 2004</p>",
  "Why? It's incomprehensible. It makes no sense. Goodness knows, this government is running low enough on political capital, so why waste another precious drop on bringing scores of Caesar's Palaces in from America? That's what the gambling bill, published yesterday, will do. <p>How strange if the major cultural impact of the Blair era becomes the transformation of Britain into the offshore Las Vegas of Europe. No other EU countries are letting them in. </p> <p>Casinos promote a glitzy image of blackjack and roulette tables served by sequined croupiers, but that is just window dressing to disguise the sordid business that really makes the money: the thousands of high value gambling machines, offering \u00a31m or unlimited jackpots through mesmerising, dead-eye addictive 12-pulls-a-minute slots. People sit transfixed, stuffing in coins - not much fun but very compulsive. Much of the lobbying over this bill has been from the US companies, asking to be allowed as many serried ranks of these machines as they can cram in. The bill allows a ratio of 25 machines to each table; now they are arguing over how small a \"table\" can be. </p> <p>Warning bells were rung long ago: the government could have stepped back, but as usual it went full steam ahead in explaining-a-bit-harder mode. The Guardian was shaking its old non-conformist fist at Tessa Jowell months ago, to very little effect. Now the Daily Mail has mounted one of its day-after-day cannonades, with the Sun and most of the rest in cavalry charge behind, we can only say lamely that we told you so. If only Labour would pick fights with these bullying behemoths more often ... but is this really the issue on which to face them down? This is not a core Labour value. </p> <p>The Tories say they are \"against a proliferation of super casinos\"; the Lib Dems oppose them. There cannot be very many Labour back-benchers who do not instinctively shudder at a Labour government deliberately turning Britain into the American-owned gambling capital of Europe. So if I were a gambler, I'd put a pony and a monkey or two with William Hill on this getting a very rough ride in parliament. Jowell's people reckon Labour MPs aren't that bothered one way or the other: it's time they were. </p> <p>The mystery is why Labour ever got into this. It seems to be a case of politicians getting so caught up in the fascinating details of an arcane industry that they lose sight of the political wood for the trees. And it looked so tempting. It means a lot of money for local authorities either in cash or in \"planning gain\", where the developer has to build socially useful things in exchange for a licence to print billions. Councils are very short of money and putting up council tax is not an option. The warm reception the bids from US companies have received in almost every city shows how temptation from super-professional persuaders is hard to resist. Tessa Jowell's people claim backbenchers are eager for these tourism-attracting cash generators on their patch. Do they know that American research shows that 6% of people who live near these magnet casinos become addicts? </p> <p>This is a cash cow for the Treasury, which is losing gambling tax to foreign internet sites. The government calls the new casinos \"regeneration\" projects, and urges their siting in derelict outskirts of cities. US companies have approached places like Burnley, Hull, Corby and Salford - alongside bids for eight in London, five in Glasgow and other more salubrious spots. But the evidence from abroad is that these super casinos are not regenerators or job creators. They are not like great new arts venues that can draw new life towards them: Atlantic City shows how casinos create economic deserts. With their gigantic acreages of free restaurants and floor shows, they suck all the business out of a wide surrounding area. </p> <p>US companies are reputed to have spent some \u00a3100m in their opening bids, assured by the government that this bill will pass. But as it comes under scrutiny, the government may find itself blushing at some of the language they use. \"Gambling is now a diverse, vibrant and innovative industry and a popular leisure activity.\" \"We will be the least restricted, most free-market based regime in Europe.\" The standard letter from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to the public says the bill will \"provide new choices for gambling consumers\" and \"make the gambling market more competitive\". It will also, I'm afraid, \"modernise\" gambling. </p> <p>Antique gambling laws need reform; internet gambling is worth trying to regulate (though it's almost certainly impossible); the spread of video roulette slot machines in the high street needs controls. All these sensible parts of the bill will no doubt pass through ... but why the big casinos? </p> <p>Government voices claim there will only be 20 to 40 super casinos, but the market will be left to regulate numbers. Since we already have small casinos, they say, what's the fuss? Of course, they say, \"some people have religious or ethical socialist objections\", but that's quaint, old fashioned stuff. </p> <p>As for the projections that the number of serious gambling addicts will rise from 350,000 to 700,000, that's all questionable social science. The figures may or may not be right, but they are certainly an underestimate. Most families racked by someone with a gambling addiction never get near officialdom. They bring their children up in the most abject poverty of all, unknown, unseen - and not counted, as their declared income (before gambling) may be high. </p> <p>Gambling has shot up five-fold in the last three years, since Gordon Brown took the tax off winnings. Women now account for 64% of internet betting, the greatest growth. Gambling turnover has risen from \u00a37.6bn to \u00a339.4bn, and now Britons spend more than any other Europeans. This is not a flutter, but serious money a lot of people can't afford. </p> <p>This government has been bold in trying to find ways to deal with social problems. Indeed the gambling bill brings in a new Gambling Commission, obligations on licence holders to watch out for addicts and powers to restrict the value of gaming machines in betting shops. But introducing the American casinos the rest of Europe has held at bay is like tackling obesity by inviting in Howard Johnson's ice cream emporiums. These casinos will make money because they will get more people to gamble a lot more money. The government has the power to restrict gambling outlets, so why let go now? </p> <p>This bill heralds a whole new gambling culture in Britain. Don't be deceived by the idea this is just a small extension; this is a culture-shift of great proportions. If it is indeed a great draw for tourism, is that the country we want to be? Are we really that desperate? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Old hands at the UN like to tell the old joke about the Italian ambassador who is annoyed that his country is being ignored in the debate about reforming the security council to better reflect contemporary global realities. <p>Germany and Japan are both making rapid progress towards the world's top table, complains the envoy - preferably in an exaggerated comic opera accent - so why not us? After all, the punchline goes: \"We lost the war too.\"</p> <p>The joke makes a serious point: 60 years after the defeat of fascism, the five permanent members of the security council - known in diplomatic shorthand as the P5 - are the victors in that conflict.</p> <p>Of these, the US is indisputably the most powerful country on the planet. China is the most populous country in the world, and one of its fastest growing economies. </p> <p>However, today's Russia is a pale shadow of its former Soviet self. Britain and France are medium-sized European powers who happen to possess - as do the other three members of this exclusive club - the legally-sanctioned nuclear weapons they acquired during or after the second world war. All five wield the vetoes that can, in theory, make or break momentous international decisions.</p> <p>Italy's claim, it has to be said, was never compelling. So the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, this summer proposed that the EU should get its own UN seat - an eminently sensible way of representing 25 member states and 450 million people, even if his transparent motive was to prevent the Germans from getting a seat for themselves.</p> <p>If any single European country deserves a place in the UN sun, it is Germany - reunited, and with a population of 82 million, it is the continent's largest country and economy, and a provider of peacekeeping forces from Macedonia to Afghanistan. </p> <p>Past sensitivities, however, are never far away, and some - for example the Poles - detect disturbing signs of the return of the sort of self-assertion by Berlin that went out of fashion for decades after 1945. </p> <p>Britain and France are enthusiastic supporters of the German claim - although cynics say, reasonably enough, that is only because they want to deflect pressure for a common EU seat. The security council, FO mandarins say, is to be enlarged, not reformed - a subtle but crucial difference.</p> <p>The bigger point, though, is this: what justification is there for a change that brings in more wealthy western countries but still excludes Africa, Latin America and the entire Muslim world, and that would leave the north-south divide as wide as ever before?</p> <p>Last month's debate in the UN general assembly, at which all 191 member countries had a go at thrashing out the issue, went some way towards sorting out these competing claims. After years of lobbying, Japan won a two-year stint in one of the security council's 10 rotating seats, hoping to prove that it deserves that coveted permanent seat when the reform process is accelerated next year.</p> <p>Momentum seems assured by the fact that Japan, Germany, Brazil and India - collectively known as the A4 - have now formally agreed to support each other's candidacies for permanent seats. </p> <p>Japan has gone further than any of the others in proving its credentials. It is heavily involved in key international issues, including the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa, and is a big contributor to UN coffers. It has also pledged to focus on the so-called \"new threats and new challenges\", including the prevention of transnational terrorism and weapons proliferation - preoccupations for everyone in the post September 11 world.</p> <p>Japanese progress has, however, whetted the appetites of other wannabees, triggering strong opposition - China and South Korea are both against Japan's bid. India has an excellent case as the world's largest democracy but, not surprisingly, it is opposed by Pakistan, which fears India would scuttle its proposals on Kashmir.</p> <p>Argentina and Mexico both want to prevent Brazil from getting in to represent Latin America. Africa, which was still largely ruled by European colonial powers when the UN was set up in 1945, could legitimately be represented by South Africa, Nigeria or Egypt, although post-apartheid South Africa has by far the best credentials.</p> <p>Simply expanding the membership of the council however, would actually prove to be a fairly minor change - doodling in the margins of the global narrative, as one expert put it. </p> <p>No reform makes sense without looking back at the council's recent history, and most notably its failures over Kosovo and Iraq, both cases in which irreconcilable splits at the top meant that military action was taken without the formal sanction of the whole body, undermining its overall legitimacy.</p> <p>Iraq, of course, was far worse because of the limited nature of support for the US-led invasion, whereas the entire Nato alliance - including France and Germany - backed action against Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p>The war against Saddam Hussein showed, all too cruelly, how paralysis during the cold war has been superseded by a unilaterally induced paralysis, the product of insuperable US hegemony. Even a more ambitious UN reform would be unlikely to change this.</p> <p>Yet Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, is still determined to try. He is currently awaiting the recommendations of the cumbersomely named High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which is tasked with finding ways to make multilateralism work.</p> <p>Its conclusions, which are due out in December, may not be good news for those aspiring to get a place round that famous horseshoe-shaped table on New York's East River. </p> <p>According to diplomatic gossip, the panel's favourite option is for seven of eight semi-permanent members to serve a four or five-year term, plus one new rotating two-year seat, resulting in a total UN security council of 24. </p> <p>Simply adding a few more seats and vetoes to the current model is likely to result only in further gridlock. So disappointment seems guaranteed, and not just for those frustrated Italians.</p>",
  "<b>Home-sellers packs</b> <br> Government plans for compulsory home-sellers packs moved a step further when a bid to block them was defeated. Voting in the Lords was 154 to 131 amid Tory protests that the proposals would be a \"poll tax on moving home\" and force vendors to pay up to \u00a31,000 to put their property in the estate agent's window. <p>But, during the housing bill's report stage, the deputy prime minister's office minister Lord Rooker said the plans were backed by the Consumers Association. He rejected claims that packs would cost \u00a31,000 and said Britain's biggest mortgage lender HBOS and its largest estate agent Countrywide were \"gearing up\" for them. </p> <p>Lord Hanningfield, for the Tories, said his party backed a voluntary scheme but it was necessary to take the compulsory element out of the bill. </p> <p><b>Iran</b><br> Time is running out for Iran to avoid referral to the UN security council over its failure to comply with nuclear obligations, international security minister Denis MacShane warned. He said the International Atomic Energy Agency had documented \"serious failings\" by Iran over 18 years to meet safeguards and transparency obligations. This has led to widespread concern about its ambitions. </p> <p><b>Westminster security</b><br> Parliament is to get a dedicated \"security coordinator\" after a series of security breaches by protesters. The appointment has been agreed in principle by the committee in charge of the running of the Commons, its spokesman Liberal Democrat Sir Archy Kirkwood said. The decision had been made after the Commons commission considered a report by police and security services. </p> <p><b>UK troops</b><br> It would be quite unacceptable for UK troops to be deployed to Baghdad under US command, Lord Watson, for the Liberal Democrats, said. He warned the government \"that the credibility of its policy on Iraq is eroded with every day of the continuing violence\". </p> <p>Foreign Office minister Lady Symons said: \"The credibility of the government on this issue, and the way it has conducted itself, has been examined by four separate committees. On each occasion the government has been acquitted of any wrongdoing, on the question of good faith.\" </p> <p><b>Company audits</b><br> Audit firms should be allowed to protect themselves from massive compensation claims for failing to spot problems in company accounts, Andrew Mitchell, for Tories, said. He proposed a raft of measures, including a cap of 20 times the fee, as MPs put the finishing touches to measures aimed at preventing an Enron-style scandal in the UK. </p> <p>Trade and industry minister Jacqui Smith said: \"If a proper package of reforms can be constructed in time, the government will aim to consult further next year on the detail of proposals to be included in a forthcoming companies bill.\" </p> <p>The companies (audit, investigation and community enterprise) bill, part of the government's strategy to help restore investor confidence in companies and financial markets after major corporate failures, gained its third reading and cleared the Commons. </p> <p><b>Uninsured drivers</b><br> A crackdown on uninsured drivers is expected to be included in the next parliamentary session, junior transport minister David Jamieson said. He told MPs ministers hoped to bring forward a bill, including giving police powers to seize and destroy uninsured vehicles. </p> <p><b>Wheelchair access</b><br> A wheelchair-bound MP told how she was forced to travel in the guards' van of a train which was \"little better than a cattle truck\". Labour's Anne Begg said the \"barbaric practice\" took place last Tuesday when she caught a Southern slam-door service from London Bridge. The Mark 1 rolling stock should have been phased out at the end of this year but three companies, including Southern, have asked to carry on using it into 2005. </p> <p>Rail minister Charlotte Atkins said: \"It is absolutely ridiculous in this day and age that anyone should have to travel in this way. It is unacceptable.\" She said the practice will end as new rolling stock comes in. </p> <p><b>Royal train</b><br> The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, confirmed the government had no plans to scrap the Royal train. Tory transport spokesman Greg Knight pointed to its \"historic and national\" significance and asked: \"Will you confirm to the House that you have no short term, medium term or long term plans to scrap the Royal train?\" </p> <p>As Labour's Dennis Skinner shouted: \"I hope he has,\" Mr Darling replied: \"Not only that but I think it is only recently that the Royal Family confirmed they wished to maintain and use the Royal train - and I am sure they will continue to do so.\" </p> <p><b>Heart disease</b><br> People suffering from congenital heart disease should not have to pay for their prescriptions, Labour's Ivan Henderson urged. He added: \"Avoiding cigarettes, alcohol or junk food will not offer them the level of health that most of us take for granted.\" His congenital heart disease (exemption from prescription charges) bill gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Alan Milburn</b><br> Labour's general election coordinator, Alan Milburn, was challenged over his appointment to the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Julian Lewis, for the Tories, criticised the decision to split the job previously performed by Douglas Alexander, who was not a member of the cabinet, into two posts - Mr Milburn's and that of Cabinet Office minister Ruth Kelly. </p> <p>Mr Lewis told Ms Kelly: \"You may only have half the job title but I'm sure you'll be doing all the work.\" Mr Milburn, appearing at question time for the first time in his new role, said Tory allegations that his job was a waste of public money were \"rather absurd\". He added to Mr Lewis: \"With you it's not so much a question of the poisoned chalice as the poison.\" </p> <p><b>Bats</b><br> Historic churches should be exempt from laws which prevent them from taking action against protected bat species which threaten their closure, the government was urged. Tory John Greenway said bats were \"wreaking havoc\" in churches across Britain, including the 1,000-year-old Saxon church of St Hilda's in Ellerburn in his Ryedale constituency. </p> <p>Nature conservation minister Ben Bradshaw said that under existing laws churches could apply for government licences which would allow them to move the bats. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The prime minister and the Tory leader, Michael Howard, face each other at Commons question time. Earlier, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, responds to MPs. The house considers Lords amendments to the armed forces (pensions and compensation) bill. There is a debate on the national service framework for children, young people and maternity. Topics of backbench debates in Westminster Hall include UK citizens detained by the US immigration service and the defence ministry military records office. </p> <p>The Lords debates the housing bill's report stage and legal services and Northern Ireland orders.</p>",
  "Mr and Mrs Flynt are having a domestic. It's not a full-blown ding-dong, but a mid-level verbal skirmish, the sort of thing that lies behind many a loving relationship. \"Larry,\" she calls down the hall of their sumptuous apartment on the 10th floor of the imposing Flynt building in Beverly Hills, \"why didn't you tell me you wanted me here for the photo? I could have got ready.\" <p>In the dining room Flynt is parked in his gold-plated wheelchair, staring out of the window, possibly at the view of the city stretched out before him. He is a curious sight, his hair and skin almost matching his peach-coloured polo-neck shirt. On his wrist he wears a delicately inlaid watch, his elaborate rings sit on surprisingly long puffy fingers, their length accentuated by manicured nails. </p> <p>\"What did she say?\" he croaks in his near- inaudible high-pitched wheeze, heavily laced with the wide-open twang of his native Kentucky. </p> <p>Hal, Flynt's bodyguard and wheelchair-wheeler, approaches. \"Nothing,\" he says. \"Don't worry about it. It's a man and wife thing.\" </p> <p>\"Why wasn't she ready? Did she say she didn't know?\" </p> <p>\"I told you, don't worry about it. I'm not getting involved,\" says Hal. </p> <p>Suitably attired, Mrs Flynt, Larry's one-time nurse Liz Berrios (often now described as the power behind the throne), appears for her photograph. The couple lean awkwardly together, mimicking the pose on the oil painting hanging behind them. Liz smiles professionally and holds Larry, who wheezes and splutters, enduring his hardship with a stoicism that looks exhausting. </p> <p>\"Come on Larry,\" she says, digging her fingers into his neck. \"Smile.\" </p> <p>It's just as well that nobody is actually chucking pots and pans around. The smallest flying object could cause incalculable damage here. At every turn, behind every marble column, standing atop every antique inlaid mahogany table, a Tiffany lamp awaits, a trap laid for the clumsy and the careless. Looking down from the walls are countless Impressionist reproductions, all a little too bright and a little too clean to be the real thing, as if someone had said: \"Do me a picture like that, but ... make it more in focus.\" </p> <p>The effect, familiar from Milos Forman's 1996 film The People Vs Larry Flynt, is of a kitsch palace, a hotel lobby striving to be a museum or some lavish pimp's parlour. Flynt, of course, would not choose to describe himself as a pimp. He is, he insists, a \"smut peddler\". He has also been called a \"bottom-feeder\", an epithet which amuses him greatly. But his preferred formulation is: \"Pornography is my business, politics is my hobby.\" </p> <p>Flynt's latest foray into politics comes with the publication of his third book, Sex, Lies and Politics - the Naked Truth. It is a rabble- rousing romp through the ills and hypocrisies of contemporary American politics, an attack on the cronyism and incompetence of George Bush and the forces that put him where he is today. But it is also a lament for the betrayed ideals of the American body politic. </p> <p>\"I think other than the civil war and the first and second world wars, the six years that this book covers is probably the most significant part in the history of our country,\" he says. In the book, we are treated to some of the key anti-Bush themes from the past few years: Newt Gingrich and the hypocrisy of the Republicans; the Democrats' weakness for money; the inadequacies of America's \"poodle press\"; Enron; Chevron; Halliburton. It is a familiar but still enlightening litany. Flynt argues that he is there to join the dots. </p> <p>\"I never, from the very beginning, ever compromised my core beliefs,\" Flynt says. \"I've been in prison four times, shot and paralysed\" - by a man who took exception to a photo spread about interracial sex - \"and I figured at this point, what are they going to do to me? So I decided to devote what is left of my life to expanding the parameters of free speech.\" </p> <p>His struggle for free speech was documented in the Forman film, an account of Flynt's various legal battles, most famously his five-year tussle with evangelist Jerry Falwell, about an ad that suggested he had had sex with his mother. Falwell sued him for defamation, Flynt countersued for copyright infringement. It ended in a victory for Flynt in the supreme court, seen by many as one of the most important decisions in favour of free speech and the first amendment of the US constitution. </p> <p>Flynt makes an awkward champion of liberal causes, his professional activities - he makes Richard Desmond seem like William Rees-Mogg - raising the hackles of many who support the broad intention of his political campaigns. \"If people don't like what I do they need to get a life,\" he says, slurping on his third glass of green Gatorade, grunting as he crunches the ice. \"I'm liberal on social issues, all social issues, but I'm a fiscal conservative. That may sound paradoxical in a sense but if I don't have the money in my account, I don't write a cheque. I think the government should be the same way. We should be fiscally responsible.\" </p> <p>Flynt's personal fiscal responsibility has seen him grow to be an extremely wealthy man, adept at shifting his business to keep ahead of the changing times. The smut- peddler has moved from club owner to magazine publisher to modern media entrepreneur, with internet, film production and retail divisions all outstripping the thing that made his name, Hustler magazine. He also runs an eponymous casino in Los Angeles, where Flynt himself can often be found betting his life away at poker. One estimate suggests he loses $300,000 (\u00a3170,000) per month at the game. </p> <p>Flynt, who was born in Kentucky in 1942 in what was then the poorest county in the US, says he is not tempted to go into politics as a profession. \"Politics is the art of compromise and I've never seen anything worthwhile accomplished by a compromising person,\" he says with a rare smile. But he has stood for office, once for president, and last year for governor of California in the election won by Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p> <p>'I can see the flaws in our system and I don't have the temperament to be part of a political party,\" he says. \"And who would vote for a pornographer who's an atheist anyway? The different times I've run for political office I've always just done it to use the platform so I can get my message out.\" </p> <p>His message in the current election is clear: Bush and his cronies are corrupt liars who have misled the American people. \"There are diehard Bush loyalists who believe everything he tells them, and it's scary,\" he says. \"It's really frightening because this guy's the most unqualified person to ever sit in the Oval office. He can barely speak the native language. Now he talks to God all the time. I'm just afraid they might get their messages screwed up, and with his thumb on the [nuclear] button that doesn't make me too content.\" </p> <p>Flynt's next book is about \"something I know quite a lot about\", the sexual revolution. But before that he has to oversee his expanding retail empire. A handful of stores in the US, including a swanky emporium on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard, complete with espresso bar, have proved a profitable addition. Flynt is also opening two stores in the UK, although he is fairly hazy on their precise whereabouts. </p> <p>\"I just make the store really nice and really plush so both men and women will feel really comfortable shopping there,\" he wheezes. \"The first we'll open in the second largest city in the United Kingdom, about two hours north of London.\" Birmingham? \"Yes, Birmingham. And the second one is in London, right next to Piccadilly Square.\" </p> <p>Britain too offers possibilities for him to pursue his hobby of politics. \"I really liked Tony Blair when he became prime minister,\" says Flynt. \"But the way he's behaved during this Iraq war, I just lost all respect for him. I don't know if he thought he would benefit from it, in terms of solidifying his power base. He's no Winston Churchill.\" </p> <p>Political hypocrites have been warned. </p> <p> <b>Nachos and throbbing paninis</b></p> <p>\"We pushed it a bit with the paninis,\" says Stefan Breg, smiling over his working menu for the Blussh Cafe. \"Nine man-inches of hot panini.\" The cafe opens next week within the erotic goods store that Hustler Hollywood is bringing to Birmingham, offering the sort of sex-and-food combo that hasn't been seen since 9Weeks. Or perhaps not. It's all in the very best taste, they tell me. A bit of fun. Even so, the appearance of cheesy nachos on a menu that includes throbbing paninis is slightly disconcerting. </p> <p>Hustler is synonymous with Larry Flynt, but Hustler Hollywood is a sanitised chain of stores run by his daughter Teresa. She has just expanded the US group from four to seven; Birmingham is the first outside the US. \"It's not right,\" says Mandy Hillen, who has sold the Evening Mail from a booth outside the store for four years. \"Families go past here. I don't approve.\" </p> <p>\"I don't mind,\" says another stallholder, watching over her stock of ponchos and scarves flapping in the rain-sodden wind, \"as long as they don't sell scarves.\" </p> <p>She shouldn't worry. If Hustler Hollywood does sell scarves, one imagines they will be strips of marabou, or shredded latex. Its stock is a predictable ensemble of sexy undies and edible this and that. The seduction range is a riot of red-fringed fishnet. Retail director Marianne Tosh says it will not sell hardcore DVDs or magazines. (Before my visit, I had to sign a form agreeing not to use the term \"Porn\", \"as that is factually incorrect\".) </p> <p>Teresa Flynt likes to call her store a \"date destination\". Given that Birmingham has the UK's highest concentration of lap-dancing bars and is the testing ground for the first in a chain of swingers' hotels called Liberation, it seems she's chosen her city wisely. And at a time when even Tesco is to start selling Vielle \"stimulators\", one suspects that Hustler's predictions of six UK stores with a \u00a328-\u00a335m gross turnover within three years might well be realistic. <b> CR</b> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Sex, Lies and Politics is published by Aurum Press, price \u00a38.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Price</strong> </p> <p>Good Food Costs Less at Sainsbury's used to be the slogan. It was never entirely true, but the price gap in the 90s widened as Tesco pursued a hard-headed US-style strategy of everyday low prices.</p> <p><strong>Management</strong> </p> <p>Sir Ian MacLaurin, who led Tesco out of the \"pile it high\" 70s, said his most important decision was finding the right successor. In Sir Terry Leahy, he appointed a man seemingly obsessed by detail. Over at Sainsbury's, where family values ran deep, there never seemed to be serious competition for the top job.</p> <p><strong>Investment</strong> </p> <p>Leahy's inheritance was the finest store portfolio in the land. It allowed Tesco to pioneer non-food lines. Sainsbury's bizarrely seemed to give up on its Savacentre format without a serious fight. Tesco was also years ahead in the switch to automated distribution; Sainsbury's response, as Mr King revealed yesterday, has been a story of cock-ups.</p> <p><strong>Better ads</strong> </p> <p>John Cleese shouting down a megaphone was the nadir for Sainsbury's. Tesco opted for Prunella Scales as the Dottie character - hardly cutting-edge but customers liked her. Jamie Oliver was a better effort from Sainsbury's - but some people loathe him.</p> <p><strong>Finest</strong> </p> <p>The launch of Tesco's \"finest\" range was directed at the heart of Sainsbury's supposed advantage: the quality end of the market. Tesco has since extended the label to homewares and fashion.</p> <p><strong>Loyalty card</strong> </p> <p>Lord Sainsbury will rightly never be allowed to forget the day he dismissed Tesco's loyalty card as \"electronic green shield stamps\". Clubcard was an immediate success and Tesco plundered the data it provided to target customers with offers. Sainsbury's Nectar card was too slow in coming.</p> <p><strong>Online</strong> </p> <p>Tesco launched straight into providing an online service by using local stores to pick products. Sainsbury's, meanwhile, cooked up a grand plan to build gigantic picking centres and then had to abandon the idea because of the costs. Belatedly, Sainsbury's copied the Tesco model, but its website is miles behind and poor shop availability has meant poor service too.</p> <p><strong>Overseas</strong> </p> <p>Sainsbury's, until it sold Shaw's last year, was trying to run a relatively small supermarket chain in the toughest retail market in the world -the US. Tesco has never set foot there, preferring to expand in the less competitive arenas of eastern Europe and the far east where its hypermarkets are often received as innovations.</p> <p><strong>Shareholders</strong> </p> <p>Sainsbury's, with the family as 38% owners, has never been totally accountable to the City. When running supermarkets seemed to run in the Sainsbury genes, that was possibly an advantage. The tide turned when Lord Sainsbury took over. As 25% shareholder he was unchallengeable - but not always right.</p> <p><strong> Arrogance</strong> </p> <p>Sainsbury's during its 1980s heyday was a snobbish organisation, convinced of its own superiority, which alienated its suppliers. The result was that many were happy to help Tesco to take them on. Tesco faces the same trap - but there is no sign of it falling in yet.</p>",
  "<p>The violence in Darfur, which has destroyed the livelihood of up to a million people, has created \"an unprecedented food crisis\", the Red Cross said yesterday. </p> <p>Attacks by the government-backed Janjaweed militia, which has burned villages and looted cattle during its attempt to crush a rebellion, have devastated agriculture and trade. </p> <p>Villagers who have not fled to refugee camps have been able to plant only a third of their normal crop, the Red Cross said. In most cases their seed, tools and cattle have been stolen. </p> <p>On a recent visit to Darfur, the Guardian found survivors of Janjaweed attacks living on watermelon seeds and grass pollen in the ruins of their villages. </p> <p>The Red Cross said: \"Most rural communities in north, west and south Darfur are facing an unprecedented food crisis, worse even than the famines they faced in the eighties and nineties. </p> <p>\"A combination of insecurity and drought has overcome the coping mechanisms that normally ensure the communities' survival.\" </p> <p>The price of staple foods has risen dramatically. Millet and sorghum, which are used to make a mash or flat bread to accompany meat and vegetables, cost two or three times as much as last year. </p> <p>Families have to rely far more on gathering wild plants, which now make up 85% of their diet. </p> <p>But ranging far from their villages to collect them exposes men and women to further attacks from roaming bands of Janjaweed. </p> <p>Villagers were \"caught up in a vicious circle of fear and hunger,\" the Red Cross said, adding that the relative security and availability of food in the camps might tempt even more villagers to flee their homes. </p> <p>It planned to continue providing food aid to villagers in their own areas, to avoid having them swell the population in the camps. </p> <p>It added: \"[We] will also distribute seeds and tools for the next planting season, between May and July 2005, to assist the communities in recovering from the destruction waged on them over the last year.\" </p> <p>The UN estimates that about 70,000 people have died from hunger and disease since the conflict began last year. </p> <p>A new round of peace talks between the Sudanese government and the two Darfur rebel groups is due to begin tomorrow in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. </p> <p>They are expected to focus on security arrangements to allow the refugees to return to their villages safely and let aid workers operate without hindrance.</p>",
  "<p>I once lived in a quiet village, astride a river, on the edge of a northern conurbation. Gradually, traffic levels rose as heavy lorries from a nearby quarry began using our through road as a handy \"ratrun\" to a main east-west route. Then, a mile away, a rather bland housing estate began to emerge - more, it seemed, by accident than by design. It grew and it grew, two-car households and more, as people moved from a nearby city to the countryside. </p> <p>Problem: how were residents supposed to reach their place of work in the city? No prizes for guessing. The result: traffic volume has increased considerably as the new, car-borne commuters make the slow crawl to the office. And it could get worse. Nearby stands a valuable piece of public land surrounding an old hospital, owned by the health service. It is one of scores of NHS sites around the country earmarked for redevelopment - that is, more housing - in a deal between the Department of Health and John Prescott's Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. </p> <p>But my experience pales into insignificance when set against plans for four big growth areas in the south-east and the east of England - the 40-mile Thames Gateway corridor east of London, a big expansion around Milton Keynes, and the development of the Stansted-M11 corridor on the Essex-Cambridge border. Last week's approval of 478,000 new homes by a regional planning panel - in spite of criticism by councils that the government-inspired plan rides roughshod over local democracy - underlines the dilemma. </p> <p>With sceptics arguing that the plan will place severe pressure on water resources, transport and the overall environment, it all seems a far cry from Prescott's vision, barely two years ago, of controlled and sensitive development. He wants well-designed townships, full of energy-efficient homes, built largely in factories and assembled quickly on site, served by new health centres, shops and other amenities, all with good bus and rail links to curb car dependency and reduce greenhouse gases. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister calls them \"sustainable communities\", and they don't come cheap. Prescott has railed against the growth of piecemeal estates around the country, with their anonymous, tawdry boxes - the kind of unplanned monstrosity on my doorstep - blotting the landscape, sometimes miles from anywhere, and truly \"unsustainable\". Not so long ago, he called for a new regime in which the \"predict and provide\" zealots in Whitehall - those who called for a building spree to meet a yet-to-be-determined need - were replaced by a more benign regime of \"plan, monitor and manage\". </p> <p>True, the deputy prime minister is championing the cause of emerging sustainable developments and new fast-track building techniques involving adventurous designs. But unless wiser counsels prevail, the reality is that building on the scale now envisaged will probably mean something very different: more estates plonked in green fields, with little thought of the long-term consequences for water supply, drainage and an already saturated road network. </p> <p>England faces three problems: the quality and design of new housing, the continued drift from conurbation to countryside throughout much of the country, and the over-concentration of new developments in the south and the east. While Prescott is making a little headway in addressing the first of these issues, the urban-rural exodus seems to be continuing, despite valiant strides in recycling old industrial land and in recolonising city centres. </p> <p>And the south and the east? Well, at last there are signs of serious questions being asked about the scale of the developments being proposed, and the need for them. This week, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), New Labour's favourite thinktank, said bluntly in a paper for a new independent commission for the south-east that the case for continued expansion of the region was wrong. Questioning the region's ability to handle further growth, it warned that the south should instead concentrate on coping with current pressures, from congestion and pollution to disparities within the region - and the lack of affordable housing. </p> <p>It also sought to demolish the argument of government agencies that further growth is needed for the region to compete with counterparts in mainland Europe. Using EU figures, the IPPR says the south-east is already on par with \"motor\" regions such as Bavaria and Baden-Wurtemberg in Germany and Lombardy in Italy - so why push for further expansion? On the wider front, this column has argued for some time that the overall development of England needs closer examination: the case for more growth in the south at the expense of a poorly performing north, with all the planning implications that throws up for the emerging growth areas. </p> <p>With the IPPR's commission providing a spurt, and with other initiatives addressing the \"English question\" about to take off, the state of this overcrowded country might even become an issue in the run-up to a likely general election in seven months' time. But maybe, on second thoughts, that's too much for short-termist politicians to digest. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Hetherington is the Guardian's regional affairs editor.</p>",
  "<p>This a significant month in my professional and personal life. Forty years ago, on a bleak, damp, west-of-Ireland October evening, I checked in at St Brigid's hospital school of nursing to start my training as a psychiatric nurse. </p> <p>Talk about gender issues: women students had what we males thought was Hilton-quality accommodation off-site, while we \"slept in\" in shared rooms alongside the mainly long-stay wards in the \"old building\", as it was called. Once the Connacht Lunatic Asylum, the hospital had been built by the British in 1833 in the classic rotunda and wing-landing style with clock tower and enclosed yard, as familiar to prisoners as to patients. </p> <p>It hadn't changed much by 1964. There were 1,652 patients and I could immediately identify institutionalisation: its smell, in your nose and on your clothes; its structure; its architecture; its very essence unmistakable. Most of us young bloods were quickly assimilated. </p> <p>That first night-sleep-in was frightening. Pass key in hand, I made my way along dim, desolate corridors to my room on ward 12. Only then did I realise that my room mate and I shared bathroom and toilet facilities with 60 long-stay patients. Constipation and retention of urine were real possibilities for an 18-year-old. </p> <p>Just then, ambling up the corridor in his nightshirt, came a man I later grew to love and respect. Paddy G was his name and he had his own 40-year milestone, but his was as a long-stay patient. \"Aha!\" he laughed. \"The new junior man, be God, you've got 30 to do 'til you get the pension, do ya want a cup of tae?\" Amazingly, he was looking after and reassuring me: empowerment in reverse, perhaps, though at that time nobody (that I knew, at any rate) believed that might ever become a reality. </p> <p>If Paddy G had said to me then that I might become a long-stay nurse, perhaps semi-institutionalised with a house and family nearby, but that before I could get my pension years in the whole hospital would be closed - and almost all the others in the British Isles shut down - I would have thought he was surely in the right place. And yet that is almost exactly what has happened. </p> <p>Only the most structurally rigid institutions, and of course the secure hospitals, have hung on. Yet even their demise is inevitable: only the time frame is debatable. And the single most important force which changed institutional care to community care, which turned depersonalisation into something approaching empowerment, which influenced modifications on medical models and changed the cultural mindset of professionals towards their vulnerable \"clients\", \"patients\" or \"service users\", was, and remains, the social work profession. The evidence for its importance to the lives and wellbeing of vulnerable people is overwhelming. </p> <p>On October 1 this year I had a very different sort of check-in. I was at Cranfield University, one of the top 10 business schools across the world, for a reunion to celebrate my MBA graduation there in 1984. Many colleagues from that year returned for the two-day get-together and it was wonderful. It also gave me an opportunity to benchmark myself against their achievements. I won't be writing to my mother. The colleague who sat next to me as a student, and was unfailingly helpful, is now chief executive of a \u00a350bn turnover company. </p> <p>Cranfield taught me many things and changed my middle life just as significantly as working in mental health changed my young life. At St Brigid's, I observed the ingredients that lead to institutionalisation and stagnation; at Cranfield, I absorbed the chemistry of change, growth, ambition, innovation, implementation, research and, most of all, the commitment to making it happen. </p> <p>My feeling for social care and health today is that the whole business would line up much closer to the Cranfield way of life than to the culture I joined in 1964. That is good for us all. </p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong>Tom Dervin is director of social services for Newcastle upon Tyne.

  "The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg yesterday exposed a large gap in Britain's immigration laws when it ruled that a Chinese woman who travelled to Belfast to have her child has the right to live in Britain because the child became an Irish citizen by birth and therefore an EU national. <p>The court ruled that Kunquian Catherine Zhu, now aged four and living with her mother, Man Levette Chen, in Cardiff, is entitled under the EU treaty as a national of the EU to live in any member state as long as she is covered by sickness insurance and has enough resources - in this case provided by her mother - not to rely on public funds.</p> <p>The child's rights as an EU national also give her mother the right to long-term residence, the court ruled.</p> <p>The Irish government now plans to change its law to block the loophole, following a referendum in which the public backed the change by four to one.</p> <p>The court held that because Catherine receives private medical treatment and child care, paid for by her mother, and is not dependent on the state, she is entitled to live in Britain as an EU national.</p> <p>The European judges ruled that it was irrelevant that Mrs Chen had travelled to Belfast specifically to enable the child she was expecting to acquire the nationality of an EU member state.</p> <p>The Luxembourg court was told Mrs Chen knew that giving birth in Britain would not give her new baby automatic residency rights because of the terms of the British Nationality Act. But she also knew that choosing Northern Ireland guaranteed Irish nationality, which is granted to anyone born anywhere on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Once that was achieved, the plan was for her daughter to live in the UK under EU rules which allow nationals of one member state, such as Ireland, the right to settle in another.</p> <p>The plan was hatched because Mrs Chen and her husband already had a son and could not have another in their own country under China's \"one-child\" rule.

  "<p><strong>Preamble</strong> What a cracker we're in for tonight. Two teams of outstanding attacking talent and flair going straight at each other. Sadly, I'm not allowed to watch the Milan - Barcelona game as, after a last-minute switch, I'm lumbered with covering Arsenal's attempt to take their Premiership form into Europe against Panathinaikos. I was supposed to be doing the Chelsea game, so unfortunately all my lengthy research into the CSKA Moscow team has flown out of the window. You will forgive me, therefore, if my report contains few of the tricky Greek names. In fact, to get them out of the way, here are the line-ups in full.</p> <p><strong>Teams</strong> </p> <p>Panathinaikos: Chalkias, Morris, Goumas, Gonzalez, Kirgiakos, Konstantinou, Basinas, Mitu, Vyntra, Skacel, Konstantinidis. Subs: Galinovic, Henriksen, Kotsolis, Maric, Epalle, Sapanis, Olisadebe. </p> <p>Arsenal: Lehmann, Lauren, Toure, Campbell, Cole, Ljungberg, Edu, Fabregas, Pires, Reyes, Henry. Subs: Taylor, Van Persie, Flamini, Cygan, Senderos, Pennant, Larsson. </p> <p>The last time these two clashed - in the group stage in 2001 - Panathinaikos actually beat Arsenal 1-0 and went on to win the group. Arsene Wenger will send out his strongest team tonight - minus Patrick Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp, whose fear of flying has left him watching the game in a north London pub - to ensure the same will not happen again. After two disappointing performances in the tournament so far, the Gunners could do with a positive result here to send out a message to the Continent and to Manchester United, whom they meet on Sunday.</p> <p>Charlie Nicholas has just claimed that Jose Reyes is the best dribbler since Diego Maradona. The jokes here are just too easy, so I will leave them out. But can this be true? Cristiano Ronaldo for one might disagree. </p> <p><strong>Emails</strong> Steven, who is stuck in Poland without a tv, says: \"How come we changed journalists all of a sudden? What have you done to Sean?\" Mr Ingle had an anecdote to tell about John Terry which, quite frankly, is more than I had to offer on the game at Stamford Bridge. So we swapped.</p> <p>Brian Byer, meanwhile, asks what I think is a question: \"Gonzalez is a Greek name?\" Clearly not - he is from Argentina and I can also tell you his first name is Ezekiel.</p> <p>Apparently the last time these teams met there was a big fight which, according to Martin Tyler, was \"unforgettable\". I can't remember it though.</p> <p><strong>2 mins</strong> It takes 78 seconds, but finally a Panathinaikos player touches the ball - their goalie. A confident start for Arsenal.</p> <p>Jonathan Cardy mentions that Ryan Giggs might have something to say about the best dribbler since Maradona. Yeah, he might mention Ronaldo's name too.</p> <p><strong>3 mins</strong> Basinas, who was in the winning Greek team at Euro 2004, fires a shot past the far post from the edge of the box. Jens Lehmann had it covered, but that's not to say he necessarily would have saved it.</p> <p><strong>4 mins</strong> Panathinaikos attack down the right and Konst...Konstat...Konstan...the big lad up front plays a good ball to the near post which Sol Campbell has to put behind.</p> <p><strong>7 mins</strong> Reyes is writhing around in pain after a terrible tackle by his marker. He obviously heard Charlie Nicholas before the game. Chelsea are one up in their match - John Terry the scorer. That'll be game over then.</p> <p>Brian Marples is a charming man: \"Hey Michael, welcome to M-by-M. Why the new-oxford.com email tag, has Barry patented the guardian.com M-by-M tag?\" Don't know really - you never know with Barry. Surely it should be me who welcomes you to the minute-by-minute?</p> <p><strong>11 mins</strong> The game has started again after a lengthy delay for Reyes' injury. Wenger looks mildly concerned.</p> <p><strong>14 mins</strong> The Greeks look impressive. Basinas had far too much time in the middle of the pitch and elected to have a pop at goal from about 30 yards. Lehmann parried the fizzing ball away.</p> <p>Julien Labonne has a good idea: \"They should organize a 'dribbling contest' between Reyes and Ronaldo this sunday at half time.\" It should be like football training when you're a young lad - with cones close together and the first one to go out and back wins. It would make great viewing.</p> <p><strong>17 mins</strong> Reyes is back on the pitch and causing mischief around the box. One ball nearly finds Ljungberg but the ball is just flicked away by the defender.</p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 0 - 1 Arsenal (Ljungberg 18)</strong> An action replay of my earlier update, with Reyes nudging a ball through the Greek defence for Ljungberg to run onto and dink over the onrushing keeper. A beautifully crafted goal. Now, can Arsenal press on and really dominate this game for once?</p> <p><strong>21 mins</strong> John Hansson says: \"The best dribbler in the game today has to be Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\" Each to his own, John. Mind you, I remember seeing him score one Mardadona-esque goal once.</p> <p> <strong>24 mins</strong> Lehmann is going crazy (any need for the word \"going\"?) because Gonzalez just had a free header which he directed wide of the goal.</p> <p><strong> 27 mins</strong> A Thierry Henry burst down the left from which the Frenchman delivers a cross to Robert Pires. His feeble effort to head the ball was laughable to be honest, the defender taking it off him easily.</p> <p>Keith Miller writes: \"My granddad has to be the best dribbler in the world - half the time he doesn't even know he's doing it.\" </p> <p><strong>31 mins</strong> Both teams are currently playing the game at a walking pace. This might have something to do with the fact it is after 11 o'clock in Athens - the players might even be breaking a curfew. Schevchenko has scored to put Milan one up against Barcelona. My mind is not elsewhere. Honestly.</p> <p><strong>34 mins</strong> Arsenal are in cruise control at the moment. Edu and Fabregas are just keeping the ball, taking the sting out of the home team and their fans. The impression is that they can step up a gear or two at any time. I wish they would do it soon though.</p> <p><strong>37 mins</strong> Panathinaikos have a free-kick in a dangerous position to the left of the penalty area. Now, will we have an attempt on goal?</p> <p><strong>38 mins</strong> There is indeed. As Arsenal only have Campbell and Toure who can head a ball it perhaps was not too surprising that one of the Greeks climbed highest, but Lehmann was able to watch it sail wide.</p> <p><strong>40 mins</strong> Ljungberg faces up to Kiriakos after the Greek lunged in on Lauren. Calvin Klein models, eh - such troublemakers.</p> <p><strong>42 mins</strong> The Gunners are dropping like flies. It's Reyes' turn to be on the floor again, clutching his face after Mitu poked him in the eye. Arsene Wenger is not a happy man, especially as the fourth official is completely ignoring him.</p> <p><strong>45 mins</strong> Basinas' effort floats onto the top of the netting. Close, but never really threatening Lehmann's goal.</p> <p><strong>44 mins</strong> Now Kolo Toure is in agony after, erm, tackling Konstantinou. There should probably be about 10 minutes of injury-time, but thankfully the ref has shown pity on us onlookers by announcing there will be just two extra minutes. Ah, Panathinaikos have a free-kick in prime position.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Hardly thrilling stuff, but Arsenal will be fairly happy with the first three quarters of an hour. In fact, the Gunners will be more concerned by the nature of some of the Greek challenges than the Greeks' attacking play. Fergie will be rubbing his hands with glee watching this.</p> <p><strong>Other half-time scores</strong><br> Rosenborg 1 - 1 PSV<br> Milan 1 - 0 Barcelona<br> Donetsk 0 - 0 Celtic<br> Anderlecht 1 - 1 Werder Bremen<br> Valencia 0 - 0 Inter<br> Chelsea 2 - 0 CSKA Moscow<br> PSG 2 - 0 Porto</p> <p><strong>Emails</strong> Keith Cundale writes: \"I thought you might like to know that, as we speak, Perth, Western Australia, is experiencing a stonking storm: thunder, lightning, the odd manic dog and tons of rain. Just the old country hey? Clearly this storm is keeping me awake, otherwise why else would I be up at 3.30am to read about '1-0 to the Arsenal'? Do you think its worth me staying up, or should I try to sleep now and read the headlines later? Stay up Keith, it can only get better. Can't it? Please?</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kes argues from a different continent: \"Just to add my tuppence worth on your dribbling debate: as a long suffering Leeds fan exiled in Hong Kong I admit that the closest my team has come to witnessing dribbling is watching Darren Huckerby do his impersonation of Forest Gump a few seasons back; however, I am sat here (3:oo am and work in the morn) watching Milan v Barca and neither Ronaldo or Reyes are the best dribbler since Ronaldinho!\" Ah, Ronaldinho. Goofy but brilliant.</p> <p>Steve Tait has another candidate: \"What about Damien Duff for best dribbler? He'd go round those half time cones like nobody's business.\"</p> <p><strong>47 mins</strong> The little Greek left-back is not best pleased with the little Greek right-back, who didn't really attack his cross at the back post with any real vigour. Now Panathinaikos want a penalty. For what, I cannot tell you. All I can tell you is that Campbell made a perfectly good tackle in the box.</p> <p>Keith has written to say he is staying awake, so is rewarded with another mention: \"As I'm awake now, can anyone tell me why Ronaldinho, who according to ESPN earlier tonght has everything in the world going for him, doesn't invest a tiny part of his weekly dosh for some new teeth?\" One of the great mysteries. Ronaldo could tag along with him to the dentist.</p> <p><strong>50 mins</strong> This is slightly better from the team in Green. Gonzalez has a shot from 20 yards which goes straight at Lehmann. Now Campbell has to make a last-ditch tackle with the Argentine bearing down on goal. He had to make contact with the ball or he could have been having an early bath.</p> <p><strong>53 mins</strong> Reyes is getting retribution for his rough treatment in the first half, crunching late tackles on two players in the space of a minute. With lehmann miskicking a clearance, the English champions are looking somewhat ruffled.</p> <p><strong>56 mins</strong> This game is folloiwing a similar pattern to all of Arsenal's European games. It's almost as if it's too easy for them as they sit back and invite pressure. Thierry Henry has been particularly lacklustre so far, but Panathinaikos are yet to capitalise.</p> <p> Phil writes: \"Hey, if they're letting just about anyone do M-by-M's these days, can I have a go? I'll never see a Champions League game live as I'm stuck at work here in New York. But if you like I could do a P-by-P of tonight's Yankee-Boston decider.\" Just about anyone? Cheeky beggar. I would certainly tune into the baseball coverage were the game not on tv. You can keep me informed on the Cards-Astros match though.</p> <p><strong>59 mins</strong> A let-off for Arsenal: from a throw-in, Gonzalez lays the ball off to Mitu who half-volleys the ball just wide of the post. Lehmann certainly wouldn't have reached that one. </p> <p><strong>62 mins</strong> Panathinaikos are making a change, bringing on Nigerian-turned-Polish livewire Emanuel Olisadebe. Konstantinou is the one making way, something my typing fingers don't mind. Arsenal have had one shot on goal so far - a damning statistic. But, of course, the only statistic that really matters is the one at the top of the screen.</p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 1 - 1 Arsenal (Gonzalez 64) </strong> The statistic at the top of the screen has changed! A phenomenal goal. Here goes my description, which just won't do it justice. Lehmann came charging out of his goal unnecessarily to head the ball out of danger, but he could only reach Gonzalez out on the right wing. The Argentine launched a volley from 35 yards back over Lehmann's curly hair and flailing hand, bouncing just before it hit the net. Arsenal do not deserve to be wining, and now they are not.</p> <p><strong>68 mins</strong> If Arsenal played at the same pace as they do in the Premiership, they would be comfortably in the lead. But even the goal has not sparked a reaction, with Panathinaikos the team looking to secure the three points.</p> <p>Jussi Keinonen, meanwhile, has an interesting theory: \"Ronaldinho shouldn't fix his his teeth for marketing reasons. In this fast-paced visual world you have advantage of being different. After all those braced teeth some Hollywood actors are now getting their teeth fixed to look like unfixed. And they still can't dribble.\"</p> <p><strong>70 mins</strong> With a free-kick just outside the Panathinaikos box, it looked like Arsenal might manage their second shot on target. Then they allowed Edu to take it. Now some chap in row Z has had a touch of the ball he wasn't expecting.</p> <p><strong>73 mins</strong> A long-range shot from Basinas flies well wide of the Arsenal goal.</p> <p>Brian Marples writes: \"Mention Hideki Matsui in your M-by-M then he'll have made an appearance in both tonights games - how likely was that, a reference to a New York-based Japanese baseball player in two Champions league M-by-M's reports?\" I'm always one to please, so there you go. Those Japanese do get everywhere don't they. They'll probably be taking photos of these reports now. </p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 1 - 2 Arsenal (Henry 74) </strong> Cole surges down the left-wing and then centres to Henry who clinically strokes the ball into the corner. So easy, so why did it take 74 minutes for them to burst into life? </p> <p><strong>77 mins</strong> The game is dying a very slow death. The crowd, who turned up three hours before kick-off apparently, are already leaving. They're only one goal down for crying out loud!</p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 2 - 2 Arsenal (Olisadebe 81)</strong> From a corner, Olisadebe rises unchallenged to nod the ball into the empty goal - empty because Lehmann had taken a trip to No Man's Land. Sol Campbell and Edu were the nearest to Olisadebe but both were stood like statues as he attacked the ball.</p> <p><strong>84 mins</strong> Chalkias, the Panathinaikos keeper, has just made a wonderful double save - first diving to block Cole's drive, then pouncing on Pires' close-range effort from the rebound. I told you this game would explode into life!</p> <p><strong>87 mins</strong> Finally Arsenal are exhibiting some of the drive and determination they show week-in week-out in England. The Greeks are defending doggedly though, leaving Henry looking downhearted.</p> <p><strong>90 mins</strong> Vintra has finally been booked after an evening of fouling Reyes. Had he been shown a yellow card in the first half like he should have been, Reyes may have had a bigger impact on the game.</p> <p>Tafari Smith says: \"In the name of proper journalism you must now mention Curt Schilling from the Boston Red Sox to balance out the blatant spreading of Yankee-ism throughout the world done by the Matsui fan.\" Being a Red Sox fan, I'm more than willing to help out there. What a game Schilling pitched last night.</p> <p><strong>Full time</strong> The ref performs a beautiful melody on his whistle to indicate he's had enough of this game. The tabloids will slate the Gunners once more for another disappointing European performance. With five points from three games, this result won't harm their chances of qualification, but, with the talent they have at their disposal, they shouldn't be making such heavy work of these trips abroad. Thanks for all your emails, Mike.</p>",
  "At Murghob, near the Chinese border between Akbaytal and Tukhmtamish in the mountainous east of Kyrgyzstan, yak herders were thinking it. <p>The same thought was crossing the minds of dried-mango producers in Burkina Faso, monastic brewers in Belgium and poultry farmers in Guatemala, while in the vast expanses of a royal palace in London, it will have entered the head of a familiar figure with an affable, eternally bewildered, smile. </p> <p>The thought is - or was - \"Time to go to Turin\". </p> <p>For the next three days, the old capital of Piedmont is hosting a conference of a reach and scale normally attempted only by the UN and other big international organisations. More than 4,000 representatives of communities producing high-qual ity foods in more than 100 countries are to come together for what has been described as the gourmet community's equivalent of a world social forum. </p> <p>Prince Charles will be addressing the final plenary session on Saturday. Other British participants include sea-salt manufacturers from Anglesey, Cornish fishermen, Cheddar cheese makers from Somerset and farmers rearing Herdwick sheep in the Lake District. </p> <p>Unlike other monster global congresses, Terra Madre, as it has been entitled, is the brainchild of one man - Carlo Petrini, the ebullient founder of the Slow Food movement. Since 1986, when it was created to protest at the opening of a McDonald's in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, Slow Food has itself grown into something of an international organisation, acquiring 80,000 members along the way. </p> <p>But Terra Madre is in a quite different category from anything it has so far attempted. Just tracing and contacting the participants was a vast challenge. Thousands of emails were dispatched, and Slow Food tapped into the representation abroad of both the Italian government and the Vatican. </p> <p>\"One of the problems was that a lot of these people didn't have passports. So we'd set about arranging that, and then we'd discover that they didn't have the documents they needed to get a passport,\" says Cinzia Scaffidi, one of the principal organisers of the event. \"There was one group of indigenous people from Brazil who wouldn't have their photos taken either. We asked why and were told they were afraid it would rob them of their souls.\" </p> <p>Accommodating the participants in and around Turin was another nightmare. Some are being put up in the city itself: in hotels, guest houses, religious institutions and the private homes of Torinese who have come forward to offer hospitality. But others are being lodged as far away as the Val d'Aosta, the French-speaking region in the Alps. Between these two extremes, hundreds of visitors have been found places to sleep in the homes of Piedmontese farmers, Ligurian fishermen and others involved in the food business in north-western Italy. </p> <p>Care has been taken to avoid diplomatic incidents by ensuring, for example, that Serbs are not put under the same roof as Albanians. In some cases, the idea has been to match the hosts with the guests. Thus, a party of Russian fisherwomen has been lodged at Noli on the Mediterranean coast. In other cases, there is a distinct hint of mischievous provocation. Fifty hearty brewers from around the world have been found places in the classy wine-growing area of the Langhe. </p> <p>During the conference itself, between the opening and closing plenary sessions, the plan is for participants to join specialist groups discussing a vast range of subjects, from honey-making techniques to farming in volcanic areas and high-altitude agriculture to pest management. So that they can understand each other, the discussions are to be interpreted simultaneously into seven languages (though whether that will be enough for the contributions of, say, Afghan raisin producers, remains to be seen). </p> <p>So who is funding this remarkable extravaganza? The answer, it turns out, is the taxpayers of Italy in general, and Piedmont in particular. </p> <p>According to Slow Food, the cash cost will be \u20ac2.6m (\u00a31.8m). Notwithstanding the fact that Italy is meant to be struggling to keep its budget deficit within agreed EU limits, the agriculture ministry in Rome has seen fit to put in \u20ac1.8m of that, with the regional government of Piedmont stumping up a further \u20ac600,000. In addition, there is a cost in kind to the local authority in Turin that is reckoned at \u20ac1m. </p> <p>What makes this all the more remarkable is that the bodies providing the cash funding are run, not by the left, but the right. When Petrini stands up tonight to open Terra Madre, he will be flanked by the governor of Piedmont, Enzo Ghigo, who belongs to Silvio Berlusconi's neo-liberal Forza Italia movement, and Italy's agriculture minister, Giovanni Alemanno, of the \"post-fascist\" National Alliance. </p> <p>These are not the sort of people you expect to be backing a project which, in Petrini's words, aims to help create a \"new planetary consciousness\". </p> <p>Part of the explanation for their odd partnership with the left-leaning Petrini lies in the broader strategy of the Berlusconi government, which is to promote Italy as a centre of gastronomic and agricultural excellence. Italians are still much closer to their rural past than, say, the British, and politicians and officials can see that their reluctance to depart from tradition, which is holding Italy back in many other spheres, offers considerable benefits when it comes to the production and preparation of quality foods. </p> <p>Italy's Eurocrats lobbied furiously to get the new European Food Safety Agency headquartered in Parma, and the government has provided enthusiastic backing for a wide range of other initiatives, including Slow Food's foundation of a university of gastronomy near Turin. </p> <p>Along the way, key figures on the Italian right seem to have been persuaded that, if they are to turn the country into a paragon of nutritional integrity, they are going to have to embrace causes normally associated with the left. This intriguing turnaround is most strikingly obvious with respect to genetically modified seeds. </p> <p>Piedmont's governor, Enzo Ghigo, last year ordered the destruction of all the GM crops that had been planted in his region and tomorrow, the hard-right agriculture minister, Giovanni Alemanno, is hoping to get through cabinet an administrative order imposing severe curbs on future planting of GM seeds. </p> <p>Terra Madre has unquestionably helped to consolidate a remarkable alliance across the usual political boundaries. But what exactly is it? The starting point for a new global movement? Or a pretentious, if well-intentioned, initiative by middle-class foodies hopelessly out of touch with the harsh realities of country life? </p> <p>Petrini does himself no favours on that score when he describes conference participants as \"intellectuals of the earth and sea\". Nevertheless, the thinking behind Terra Madre departs from the fact that Slow Food and other similar organisations are indeed overwhelmingly clubs for prosperous food lovers from the developed world. </p> <p>Petrini sees a danger that, \"We all become top-class gourmets and connoisseurs of rare delicacies while ignoring the need to prevent the disappearance of those who actually work the land and supply the products.\" To that extent, the venture has an element of self-interest. But Petrini's aim is to use Terra Madre for the creation of a series of new networks that will allow producers from the developing world to swap information among themselves and provide them with access to the technical expertise and marketing opportunities available in the richer north. </p> <p>\"The important thing about Terra Madre is not really what happens during the conference, but what happens afterwards when people go back to their villages,\" he says. \"My hope is that they become involved in effective networks and that, having attended Terra Madre and met other people in similar situations, they will feel less lonely.\" </p> <p>Everyone attending the conference will get a directory containing the names and contact details of all the participants. \"They will take this book away with them, and I hope they use it,\" says Petrini. </p> <p>It takes a stretch of the imagination, perhaps, to envisage Madagascan zebu herders swapping emails with Bulgarian pig farmers, but in the age of the internet anything is possible. Slow Food has already had experience of how a lit tle expert knowledge can transform the prospects of poor food producers. </p> <p>In the 1990s, a Moroccan university teacher helped set up a women's cooperative in the south of the country to produce oil from the argan or Moroccan ironwood tree, a plant that is thought to have medicinal properties and has caught the fancy of top chefs as far away as the US. </p> <p>The women found, however, that the oil went off quickly when stored. Through Slow Food's mediation, two Italian experts were dispatched to Morocco where they found that the answer was to store the oil in metal, rather than plastic, containers or in bottles made of dark glass. </p> <p>\"That is an example of the kind of cross-fertilisation we are hoping will come out of Terra Madre,\" said a Slow Food spokeswoman, Alessandra Abbona. </p> <p>Though Petrini has always tried to distance himself from the overtly political agenda of Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, the French anti-globalisation activist, it is quite clear that with Terra Madre he is nudging the movement he created a step closer to the anti-globalisation camp. He describes the people he is seeking to help as, \"Those who feel the repercussions, all too often negative, of the decisions taken in the international headquarters of WTO, the IMF and the World Bank\". His aim is to, \"create a counter-trend to that which the world believes is inevitable\". </p> <p>He adds: \"It may be a dream. But I have always believed in the idea that he who sows utopias, harvests realities.\"</p>",
  "<p>In her book, Another World is Possible if ..., Susan George, key thinker of the global justice movement (she thinks the term \"anti-globalisation\" is inaccurate and a bit demeaning, because the movement is proposing a more just, equitable and sustainable version of international co-operation), argues that knowledge and understanding must be key components of building a movement for social change. The world is complicated, the causes of human hardship are increasingly harder to understand, let alone challenge, good knowledge is crucial to making good political choices. </p> <p>Not much here that those of us who work in education could disagree with - because, regardless of political affiliation, we tend to agree with Ms George that we have a special and central role in shaping the world. If nothing else, more education certainly gives you a sense of self-importance.</p> <p>\"The global social justice movement seems to have a disproportionate number of educators in its ranks, which is an excellent thing because teachers and academics have particularly serious responsibilities for world-changing,\" she says in her book. </p> <p>In fact, Ms George is a bit scolding when she writes about the role of educators. Institutional pressures, the imperatives of career building, the difficulty of getting a permanent job and the suspicion of unorthodox ways of thinking and writing - all of this militates against academics playing a useful role in understanding and changing our world. We are too busy trying to gain favour and recognition within our disciplines and from our higher-ups to risk writing anything that ordinary people might want to read. </p> <p>Playing within the rules of the university is more likely to make us into barriers to social change - protecting and measuring our specialisms for the purposes of ratings and funding, but shying away from anything as controversial as accessible political education. Properly told off, and like a lot of other educators, I trekked off to Alexandra Palace to see what I could learn and unlearn. </p> <p>In the end, the European Social Forum last weekend proved to be slightly alarming, yet oddly familiar. I'm not so good with crowds and noise - of course preferring the calm and sobriety of library and senior common room - and such a concentrated collection of long lost friends and half-forgotten enemies brought out my worst anti-social tendencies. At the same time, the whole event was reminiscent of large academic conferences with endless parallel sessions and many delegates lost in transit and content to hang out in the spaces in between. So although I am glad I went, I am more glad it is over and there is space again to think about every day campaigning and education without the hurly-burly of the fair.</p> <p>Of course, it is partly my own fault for not being involved in the planning and instead waiting to be told how my various affiliations might want to use the event. And I did see some actual dialogue, some of which was seriously strange - my favourite head-imploding moment coming when the speaker berated the Trotskyist left for confusing genuine national liberation movements and the counter-revolutionary forces of Hungary in 1956 and, over time, contributing to the destruction of the glorious revolutionary example of the Soviet Union, a tirade that was met with remarkable good humour from other speakers and much hilarity from the audience. </p> <p>But mainly the event seemed to be a lot of very old-style meetings all at once, with endless speakers and questions from the floor that turned out to be yet more speeches. Overall, and not for the first time, I came away convinced that we really need to find other ways of speaking to each other. </p> <p>In this vein, one of my favourite lessons in how to learn came from Tariq Ramadan, a leading Islamic scholar who has been denied his visa to take up an academic position in the US.</p> <p>Professor Ramadan, who has become something of a pin-up for the promotion of inter-cultural dialogue, stressed the need to avoid confusing a global movement for social justice with a standardised movement that saw one solution for all. And although this can be hard terrain right now, he gave a pretty engaging, not to mention charming, account of how we must learn from and listen to each other. The prevailing climate of anxiety around security has created a psychology of fear in the population at large, exacerbating divisions and suspicions - so dialogue is difficult, but urgently necessary.</p> <p>Professor Ramadan argued that there is a lack of mutual trust in the way different communities live together - and for those interested in social justice this raised the question of how we can understand that; although we don't come from the same background, we can have common values. Such an understanding must recognise that we share the same values and principles - but not the same models for achieving these goals. As an example, he cited his own work as an attempt to create a liberation theology coming out of the Islamic world, a theology that could come with a global social justice perspective and be grounded within the traditions and histories of the Islamic world - something that contemporary western perspectives seem unable to imagine. Even within the ESF, he suggested, there were some simplistic ways of thinking about others (my sister tells me that at another meeting someone from the floor tried to shout him off the stage). Much better to stretch and to respect each other's complexity. Hard ideas lucidly expressed, and with some laughs along the way. I'm using him as my role model to become a less shameful type of educator.</p>"
