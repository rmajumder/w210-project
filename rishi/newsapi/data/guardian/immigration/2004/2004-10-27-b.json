  "Ariel Sharon is no dove. On the ornithological scale that measures readiness for compromise on the enduring issues of peace and territory in the Arab-Israeli dispute, he has always been a hawk - and one with a dangerously sharp beak. But last night, amid extraordinary scenes, a deeply divided Knesset backed his plan to disengage from the Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since its victory in the 1967 war. Against a background of unrelieved gloom about the prospects for peace, this is a landmark moment for both parties to this intractable conflict. If Greater Israel is shrinking, that is good news. <p>It is a long time since adoring supporters chanted \"Arik King of Israel\" to a rousing biblical tune. Palestinians regard the Likud leader as the most vicious of Israeli prime ministers - fundamentally opposed to Palestinian rights and architect of hardline policies that have brought them untold misery. Mr Sharon entered politics after a career spent in the army and has retained the bulldozing style he displayed as a young officer in the 1950s, through his time crushing PLO resistance in the Gaza of the 1970s, as the defence minister planning the Lebanon war in 1982, as the godfather of many of the settlements dotted right across the occupied Arab territories. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's decision to pull out of Gaza, and more significantly, dismantle its 21 Jewish outposts, is a tactical withdrawal worthy of this old warhorse. The strip's population of 1.4 million Palestinians, crammed into squalid refugee camps and radicalised by the rise of militant Islamist groups, are an unmanageable burden even with the military superiority brought by remote-controlled drones, Apache helicopters and laser-guided missiles against an enemy armed with primitive rockets and suicide bombers. Even if the moral and human cost of staying put is not uppermost in his mind, the Israeli leader has still made a key move. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's intention is to reduce daily confrontations in Gaza while buying time over the West Bank. This is territory, as he put it obliquely but clearly on Monday, that he sees as \"essential to our existence.\" But it is also where most Palestinians live, and without it there cannot be a viable Palestinian state, still - despite George Bush's short-sighted sabotage - the goal of the internationally backed \"road map\" to peace. </p> <p>Yet it is also a manoeuvre of huge strategic significance. An Israeli withdrawal will allow Gazans, helped by a generous world, to salvage something from the long decades of occupation. It also creates an important precedent for dismantling settlements - a taboo for Mr Sharon's furious critics. But there should be no mistake about these outposts, subsidised by the Israeli taxpayer, built on confiscated land with swimming pools and beautifully tended lawns behind the barbed wire and watchtowers that guard them from Palestinian fury. They have no legal or moral justification. It is right that they should go. </p> <p>Observers of the Arab-Israeli conflict often argue that it is only a strong leader of the right, like Mr Sharon, who can make the painful choices needed for peace, as it was General de Gaulle who understood that though the Algerian war could be won militarily, it could not be sustained politically. This can be overstated. Mr Sharon needs the support of the opposition Labour party for his Gaza plan and is haemorrhaging support from his own side. An earlier Likud leader, Menachem Begin, faced extremist wrath by agreeing to dismantle settlements in Sinai in exchange for peace with Egypt in 1979. But that was only done to avoid dealing with the heart of the conflict - the rights of the Palestinians. Leaving the Gaza Strip is a necessary but not sufficient condition to establish peace. Gaza's liberation can be first. It will mean little if it also turns out to be last.</p>",

And today, to a list including Maggie Simpson (shot Mr Burns) and Peter Stringfellow's hairdresser (created that monstrosity) we were able to add Ashley Cole, who was fingered as the man who ignored the starving thousands around the world and threw a fresh pizza-WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WAS CESC FABREGAS?!</p> <p>\"Cesc was already a hit with the fans,\" an Arsenal fan told the Star, \"but throwing pizza at Fergie is the stuff of legends.\" Or fiction, if today's Sun is anything to go by. \"Ashley loves pizza. He'd normally eat it not throw it,\" snorted their ubiquitous 'witness', as sides split all over the Home Counties. \"The Arsenal players thought it was hilarious.\" But the laughing has to stop sometime, if only for the sake of a contrived segue, and so Arsene Wenger - borrowing one of his mate Fergie's favourite tricks and sending the press hounds totally off the scent - signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal today.</p> <p>\"I love this club and am very happy here,\" cooed Wenger, as Cole and Fabregas pegged it out the back door. \"These are exciting times for Arsenal and I'm proud to be the manager.\" Wenger, who's signed on until 2008, was proud of his brave boys on Sunday - but the Arsenal directors weren't. Apparently suits from Highbury and Old Trafford will now meet over a 74-course buffet (insert your own pea soup/pizza gag here) in a bid to ensure that love, peace and harmony will prevail the next time the clubs meet.

It could be that just as Arsene Wenger suffers from sudden attacks of blindness, Paphitis was struck by temporary deafness, since scores of ear-witnesses claim the roots of their rage were taunts from the Millwall fans at their black players and derisive chants about Hillsborough (\"You Should Have Died At Hillsborough\" etc), Jamie Bulger, Ken Bigley and anything else deemed likely to offend.</p> <p>Such suggestions, however, left Paphitis unmoved. \"I am fed up with hearing that the poor old Liverpool fans were provoked into getting onto the pitch and into trying to fight the police, and that it is all Millwall's fault,\" he stormed. The crux of his argument - that nasty taunts aren't an excuse for a riot - isn't completely unreasonable. (And Manchester United supporters, used to being reminded of the Munich air crash by, amongst others, some Liverpool fans, may or may not share that view.)

  "<p>'Single, twice divorced, bisexual, tattooed blood and sex fetishist, 30, seeks foreign baby for quick adoption. Slavic appearance essential.\" It's an approach that is unlikely to impress the adoption authorities of even the most forward-looking country. Unless, that is, you're Angelina Jolie, star of Tomb Raider, multimillionaire daughter of John Voight, ex-wife of Billy Bob Thornton, and Esquire's \"sexiest woman alive\". If you're Angelina Jolie, incidentals such as inter-country adoption regulations may well be just that: incidental. </p> <p>Jolie was this week reported to be in the process of adopting a baby boy, seven-month-old Gleb, from a Russian orphanage. When she has cleared all the hurdles involved in bringing him home to America, Gleb will join three-year-old Maddox, adopted from Cambodia, in the Jolie household. According to the Sunday Times, the actress was not subjected to the rigours of the normal Russian adoption process, which stipulates that an initial selection is made from a central register using photos and detailed medical records, before a child can be seen. Instead she visited several orphanages, before choosing Gleb from Baby House 13, his spookily named current home. </p> <p>\"She knows from bitter experience that sometimes you have to cut through the red tape to save a child and she is more than willing to do it,\" a unnamed friend of Jolie allegedly told the paper. </p> <p>Jolie, of course, is not the first Hollywood megastar to join the Insta-mum Club, and despite all the sneering, she may well prove to be a great mother to Maddox and Gleb. Joan Crawford may have set the bar low as the horrific \"Mommy Dearest\", but actors such as Calista Flockhart (adoptive single mother to US-born Liam), Sharon Stone (thrice married, recently divorced adoptive mum to toddler Roan) and Michelle Pfeiffer (adopted Claudia Rose shortly before meeting husband David Kelley and giving birth to their son John Henry) all seem to be doing a sensible job of raising their children without the use of wire coathangers. And Jolie does have lots going for her, including bags of cash and a big heart - she is, after all, a UN goodwill ambassador known for her interest in international children's welfare issues. </p> <p>Even if the Russians did slightly warp their rules for Jolie, the process is not exactly ironclad in America, whether it's a domestic baby or a Russian one that you want to adopt. Adoption laws vary from state to state and there is no national register of adoption agencies as there is over here. This makes adoption in the US a haphazard, fraught and highly lucrative business populated by unscrupulous adoption \"facilitators\" and involving atrocious practices such as baby hawking on the internet (including bidding wars and splitting up twins to maximize profits). Jolie might have circumvented the odd Russian regulation, but at least she didn't snap Gleb up on eBay. </p> <p>Of course, that's not to say that Jolie has been as thoroughly vetted as she ought to have been. In Britain, she would have been subject to all kinds of checks that aren't standard in America. Whether or not she would have made it through this process is debatable. According to a spokeman from the Department for Education and Skills, \"Anyone applying to adopt from another country must be assessed and approved in the same way as someone applying to adopt domestically, regardless of their relationship to the child or the country they wish to adopt from. Being single would not have counted against Jolie: according to Barbara Hutchinson, deputy chief executive of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, marital status is no barrier to adoption: \"Year on year there is a slight increase in the number of single women who are choosing to adopt by themselves,\" says Hutchinson. (In the past three years, roughly 360 single British people adopted a child.) Her unstable family background (divorced parents, volatile relationship with estranged father) might not have counted against her, either. But her own two broken marriages might have. Any depression or weird sexual behaviour would certainly have been looked on with suspicion. And the demands of her intense international career may not have been kindly viewed. </p> <p>But frankly, if I had to choose between a childhood in \"Babyhouse 13\" or one in Hollywood, I know which one I'd pick. So good for Angelina with her big heart and deep pockets. And if she decides to adopt a third foreign child, she could always consider Britain. Here, around 2,430 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are being looked after by local authorities and there are around 6,000 children in children's homes. As Hutchinson says: \"BAAF would urge anyone who has the time and space, who can offer stability and permanence to a child waiting to be adopted to make an application.\" </p> <p>Most of those children, of course, aren't cute little babies like Gleb - many are older, and have all sorts of physical and psychological problems. But they still need a home ... or even a Hollywood mansion.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to Skerries secondary school. There are only two pupils - brothers Christopher and Brian Hay - and they share their spanking new school building with the local primary (which boasts a magnificent four pupils). But Skerries secondary, which serves the island community of Out Skerries, in Shetland, has not one but two claims to fame: it is the smallest secondary in the country, and it is also the most expensive. </p> <p>The two Hays boys spend most of their time with secondary teacher Sheilagh Smith, although some subjects such as music and technology are covered by travelling teachers. School is fun, according to the boys, and being taught by one teacher most of the time has not yet become boring. The school is well equipped and would be the envy of many local authorities with state-of-the-art IT technology and a well-stocked library. The teacher-pupil ratio might be thought of as absurdly generous, but beyond that the Hays' school life is pretty ordinary - although many inner-city schoolchildren might beg to differ. After school, Bryan and Christopher play with the other children on the island. Football is unsurprisingly the most popular game. On rainy days, all the kids stay inside and spend time on their computers. </p> <p>This quiet rhythm was in grave danger of being rudely interrupted - after all, a state school for two is an obvious target in a cash-strapped education system - but this week the teenage Hay boys learned that they will, after all, be able to continue at Skerries secondary. It is an enormous relief to the tiny local community, although there are certain to be further battles. </p> <p>The school has had doubts hanging over it from the outset. Two years ago, the school building was opened with speeches and a ceilidh in the local hall. Three months later, the first rumours began to circulate. Shetland Islands Council wanted to close the secondary department for educational and financial reasons, it was said. By the beginning of this year the rumours had developed into a firm proposal, and the 75 islanders began their determined fight to keep the secondary school open: for them, it is a matter of safeguarding their future. </p> <p>The local council's working party on the subject took the view that closing the school's secondary department would provide \"the best possible educational and social opportunities for secondary pupils from Skerries\". And then there was the money issue. Shetland spends double the amount on education than the Scottish average, and closing the secondary unit would have saved the local authority \u00a392,000 annually in running costs (a figure that is disputed by the local community). But regardless of whether the saving would be just over or just under the \u00a390,000 mark, Bryan and Christopher Hay are the most expensive pupils in the Scottish education system. </p> <p>The locals think that the money is well spent. Schools are the focal points in Shetland's scattered villages, and the survival of whole communities depend on whether their school has a future. \"I am absolutely delighted; it is an unbelievable feeling, a tremendous feeling of relief,\" says Brenda Hay, mother of Bryan, 13, and Christopher, 14. </p> <p>Had things gone against the islanders, the Hay boys would have had to leave home every Sunday afternoon to be educated at the Anderson High School in Lerwick. Staying in hostel accommodation in the town, it would have meant that the teenagers could be home only at weekends, which is when the ferry runs (weather allowing). </p> <p>\"I didn't want them to go to the Anderson High School, not at that age, says Mrs Hay. \"It would mean they could not be home every night. It almost feels as though they would have taken the boys from me.\" </p> <p>Mrs Hay was born on the island. She left for a while, but returned 18 years ago with her husband, who is from Orkney, to bring up a family. She and all the other islanders say Skerries is the perfect place to bring up children. For generations the islanders have made a living from the sea that surrounds the small rocky outcrop off the east coast of Shetland's mainland. </p> <p>The boys have followed their father's footsteps, going out to sea in family-owned boats. But a crisis struck a few years ago when the community-owned salmon farm was put in quarantine because of a disease scare. The island's small fish factory, employing mainly the female population on a part-time, temporary basis, had to close. At the same time there were more general pressures: the fishing industry began to suffer from over-fishing and there were cutbacks in quotas. Suddenly, the island was vulnerable, and families began thinking of moving away. </p> <p>Monday's school victory therefore feels very much like a turning point in the Skerries story. \"The school is such a community thing, everything here is linked to it. The survival of the secondary department means families can now stay her and we can concentrate on getting the fish factory going again,\" says Mrs Hay. </p> <p>Her confidence is echoed by Denise Anderson, the chairwoman of the school board and mother of four. \"We are certainly looking with more hope into the future. We have managed to convince councillors of our case. Now we have one less problem.\" </p> <p>With the school problem almost sorted and the restart of the fish factory as a processing plant for scallops imminent, it seems that the islanders' community spirit has won the day. Already some former islanders are considering moving back. </p> <p>Twenty-year-old Alistair Arthur hopes to build a new house on the island and start a family with his fiancee. His mother Alice says he never would have come back had there not been the secondary school. </p> <p>But even if the decision does spark a mini immigration of returning islanders, the local secondary isn't likely to fill up any time soon. So, should any parents further south be sick of life in the rat race, and looking for a quiet life, with lots of sea air and a great local secondary, Skerries might just be worth a look.</p>",
  "The government has scrapped the idea of combining the proposed national identity card with passports and driving licences, it was confirmed today. <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, has had a change of heart and is instead opting for a free-standing ID card.</p> <p>In a package of \"refinements\" to the controversial proposals, Mr Blunkett also announced that the multi-billion pound scheme will be run by a \"simplified\" single agency attached to the Home Office.</p> <p>The Home Office's official response to the commons' home affairs select committee inquiry into the project said: \"When cost, implementation and risk considerations are assessed together, we now think the option of a free-standing card is more attractive.\"</p> <p>However, there would still be merit in retaining some kind of link between the new ID cards and existing documents, particularly passports, it added.</p> <p>Announcing further details of how the planned system will operate, the Home Office report revealed there will be a \"single, standard verification service\" for government departments to check the identity of cardholders. It would operate as a secure online site, it added.</p> <p>In the government scheme, new cards will include \"biometric\" details of each cardholder, such as their fingerprints, an electronic scan of the dimensions of their face or a scan of the iris of their eye. These unique features will be compared against records held on a central national identity register - theoretically making the cards impossible to forge.</p> <p>The government believes the cards will help combat illegal immigration and working, terrorism and identity fraud. Presenting the card at hospitals, benefits offices and other government agencies will also help exclude people who are not entitled to use state services.</p> <p>The cards - the first national ID card in Britain since wartime cards were scrapped 52 years ago - will be compulsory to have but not to carry.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett said: \"Our plans to bring in a national ID card scheme lie at the heart of our work to ensure that the UK can meet the challenges of a changing world. Biometric ID cards will provide a simple and secure means of verifying identity.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I will now bring forward legislation to bring in a compulsory, national ID card scheme.\"</p> <p>A bill is widely expected to be included in the next Queen's speech.</p> <p>The Home Office had originally planned to phase in ID cards from 2007-2008 as people applied for new or replacement passports. Today's announcement scrapped that plan. Instead, passport applicants from 2007-2008 will get a new biometric passport and a separate ID card.</p> <p>John Denham, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: \"While there are many detailed issues still to be clarified, and further work needs to be done on costings, the government's response makes it much more likely that this essential scheme will succeed.</p> <p>\"Over the coming months, parliament will want to scrutinise carefully the proposed statutory aims of the scheme, the powers of the commissioner, and the safeguards against misuse of the system.</p> <p>\"If we can get these areas of the bill right, the ID card scheme can be placed on a sound legal footing.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"It appears that when you next renew your passport, you will have no choice but to spend \u00a335 on a stand-alone ID card, on top of a \u00a373 charge for the passport. The cost to the public seems to escalate with every announcement.</p> <p>\"On top of our existing concerns about the card's ability to tackle crime and terrorism, there is increasing evidence to suggest that biometric technology is not as foolproof as the government claims.</p> <p>\"At the very least, ministers should find out if the technology works before committing us to ID cards.\"</p>",

  "Kremlin officials say Mr Putin is attending a celebration of the liberation of Kiev from the Nazis, but the opposition has claimed the visit was timed to allow him to influ-ence the electorate with his choice for president, the prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich, six days before the crucial vote. <p>Mr Putin told Ukrainian television that visa restrictions between Russia and Ukraine would be eased. He also floated the possibility of dual citizenship for Ukrainian and Russian citizens, a popular move among voters. </p> <p>Mr Putin said that, in relations with Russia, the recent government had positively \"structured our relationship not only in economics... [but] in politics as well\". </p> <p>The trip was expected to add to the tension surrounding the poll. A pro-opposition lawmaker said he escaped unhurt when his car was firebombed on Monday, and a student group claimed its offices were raided by the country's secret service. </p> <p>The opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, has claimed he was poisoned and opposition journalists have gone on hunger strike to protest at what they call a government clampdown. </p> <p>The government has dismissed the incidents as publicity stunts. </p> <p>The incumbent president, Leonid Kuchma, said campaigning so far had \"exceeded the framework of human decency\". He cancelled a trip to neighbouring Poland after thousands took to the streets at the weekend. </p> <p>Mr Putin has met Mr Yanukovich several times in Moscow to express his support, and pro-Yanukovich posters have been put up all over the Russian capital. </p> <p>In comments carried on his website, Mr Yushchenko called Mr Putin's visit \"untimely\". </p> <p>He said he was not among those who \"overestimate Russia's influence on Ukraine's election results\". But added: \"Yanukovich lacks his own authority to win these elections.\" </p> <p>Mr Yushchenko has also complained at not being allowed on nationwide television during prime-time. </p> <p>Dmitri Pskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said Mr Putin was in Kiev at the invitation of the incumbent president, as were the presidents of Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan. He said Mr Putin was giving an interview, as \"he often does when travelling\". </p> <p>He rejected accusations that the visit was timed to influence Sunday's vote. </p> <p>\"There are norms of political ethics and Mr Putin is a wise enough president not to use such trips to make public his preferences,\" he said. </p> <p>The opposition has also protested against Russia's decision to set up 41 polling booths for ethnic Ukrainians living in Russia, who are more likely to support Mr Yanukovich. </p> <p>The Yushchenko campaign has said the stations are for an alleged 150,000 voters living abroad yet, they added, Ukraine does not recognise dual citizenship and most of those targeted were ineligible to vote. </p> <p>An MP and leading ally of Mr Yushchenko, Volodymyr Bondarenko, said yesterday his car had been firebombed in a village near Kiev. No one was injured. </p> <p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the lead-up to the vote had been marred by biased use of the media in favour of Mr Yanukovich. </p>",
  "<p>\"And there's me paying for bottled water at Morrisons,\" said Betty Spooner with a tut and a shake of her head, after doing her bit for the revival of that old-fashioned tipple, Ordinary British Tap. </p> <p>The retired sales assistant and buyer had just blind-tasted Yorkshire Water's everyday product, which costs about a halfpenny a litre, and pronounced it better than two bottled rivals selling at \u00a31 for 330 ml each.</p> <p>\"That's what we like to hear,\" said David Simister of Yorkshire Water, which yesterday became the first British water company to trademark its tapwater, as an upfront declaration of faith in the mains. \"We know we've got a really good product, and since it's available from every cold tap in the Yorkshire region, we'd be mad not to protect its name.\"</p> <p>The legal move registers the cold mains water supply of some 4,700,000 households and could see the firm take legal action against companies passing off tap water - even if given extra treatment - as their own product.</p> <p>The issue was highlighted earlier this year by the embarrassing fiasco of Dasani, Coca-Cola's \"pure\" bottled water which turned out to be drawn from taps in the London suburb of Sidcup. The firm's \"highly sophisticated purification process\" proved to be the reverse osmosis system used in many domestic purifiers. And the drink was then withdrawn in Britain when traces of the chemical bromate were found.</p> <p>Yorkshire tap will now be known officially as Icytonic, a punning spin on the ever-increasing range of \"isotonic\" sports drinks, whose market growth has soared alongside sales of bottled water. Richard Flint, director of Yorkshire Water's water business unit, said: \"From now Icytonic is only available from Yorkshire taps. Anything else is a copy or a fake.\"</p> <p>Registering the trademark follows tests of the brand-name last year, based on the mass issue of free plastic bottles to hundreds of schools and other institutions.</p> <p>At a halfpenny a litre, Yorkshire Water has no plans to sell bottled water, but it recognised the main glitch with taking its product straight from the tap. \"Yes, it's best served chilled,\" said Mr Flint, whose strategy was to persuade customers to fill bottles from their taps, put them in the fridge and then take them chilled on outings.</p> <p>The campaign ran side by side with a drive to get restaurant customers \"to ask for Yorkshire Water by name,\" so as to avoid the possible embarrassment of specifying tap.</p> <p>The drive to promote \"ordinary\" water was not particularly commercial, Yorkshire Water said yesterday, in terms of the actual increase in amounts piped to customers who stop buying bottled rivals. \"It's more a statement of confidence in a cheap but healthy and wholesome product,\" said Mr Simister.</p> <p>Bottled water's extraordinary market rise has been driven by concern about public water treatment. But Yorkshire water - or Icytonic - won its best ratings to date in this year's annual survey by the Drinking Water Inspectorate: 99.95% on both UK and EU tests.</p> <p>Yesterday's tasting, organised by the Guardian, was at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, where restaurant supervisor Diane Kendall reckons that half of customers opt for jugs of tap water, served with ice.</p> <p>The theatre has also recently replaced bottled water machines for staff with new ones connected to the mains, which can both chill Icytonic and boil it for hot drinks. \"No one's complained about there being any difference,\" said executive director Dan Bates. \"And now we don't have a health and safety issue over people staggering about with huge containers when they had to change the bottled supply.\"</p>",
  "<b> On the road</b> <br> <p><b> In the run-up to polling day, <b> Gary Younge </b> is driving the 2,147 miles from John Kerry's base in Boston, Massachusetts to George Bush's home town of Midland, Texas. Today he reaches Bill Clinton's old home state, Arkansas </b><br> </p> <p> Route 65 dips, rises and swings through the Ozark mountains, past rib shacks offering hickory hams and small stores emblazoned with the confederate flag. \"The past is never dead,\" wrote Mississippi's famous son, William Faulkner, of the south. \"It's not even past.\" </p> <p>And so it is as you pass through the whitest part of Arkansas, a former confederate state, where some residents openly embrace the lost cause to defend a discredited institution - slavery - almost 150 years after it was defeated.</p> <p>Arriving in Little Rock the sun is high and the air is humid. This is the deep south, where salad comes with fried chicken and race comes with everything: it remains the single most consistent indicator of where you live, whom you date, what TV programmes you watch, where you pray and, not least, how you vote.</p> <p>In his office at the state's Democratic party headquarters, Rodney Shelton, who is responsible for outreach to black voters, shows me two maps of Arkansas. One indicates the breakdown of the vote in 2000, with the heavily Democratic areas shaded in progressively darker tones; the other reveals the breakdown of the state by race, coloured in the same way. The patterns are virtually identical - the darker the shade on the map indicating Democrat support, the darker the people who live there.</p> <p>\"The black vote is absolutely critical to the Democratic vote,\" says Mr Shelton. \"We just can't win without it.\"</p> <p>What is true for Arkansas is equally true for the whole country. The Democrats have won only one election since the second world war (in 1964) without the black vote. African Americans make up more than 10% of voters in a third of the crucial battleground states, including Ohio, Florida and Michigan. Yet a recent poll by the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies shows that while black Americans have an incredibly low opinion of George Bush - giving him just a 22% approval rating - they have yet to warm to the Democratic challenger, John Kerry. In 2000 the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, got 80% of the black vote to Mr Bush's 9%. This year, the centre's polling shows Mr Kerry on just 68% while the president has doubled his share to 18%.</p> <p>\"This poll is showing a certain amount of black ambivalence in terms of election year issues that resonate within the community, and their relationship with Senator Kerry,\" said Eddie N Williams, the president of the centre. \"They have not yet embraced Senator Kerry to the extent that they did former president Bill Clinton and former vice president Gore.\"</p> <p>Of one of the central planks of Mr Bush's agenda, the war on terror, Hank Wilkins, 22, an African American, said: \"Black Americans have a history of being terrorised in America, so the idea that we could be attacked in our own country was not something new to us.\"</p> <p>The other plank, the war in Iraq, plays badly with most. \"The domestic issues and the foreign policy issues are inter-twined,\" said Vivien Flowers, 35. \"If you look at who's fighting out there it's the folks who don't have jobs or healthcare who joined the army. They were sent for a reason and that reason no longer exists.\"</p> <p>Added to this is the way Mr Bush gained office: the debacle in Florida when a disproportionate number of African American voters were either turned away at the polls or had their votes discounted.</p> <p>\"A lot of people feel that Mr Bush did not win the 2000 election and a huge number of black voters were disenfranchised in Florida,\" said Dale Charles, the chapter president of Little Rock's National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the country's oldest civil rights organisation.</p> <p>The joint centre's poll shows that 63% of black Americans are concerned that their vote might not be even be counted next Tuesday. It was an issue Mr Gore stressed on Sunday as he visited black churches in Florida, his presence searing the experience of 2000 into the minds of black voters in the hope that it would galvanise them next week. \"If any of you felt frustrated or angry about what was done four years ago, I want to encourage you not to ignore those feelings,\" he said. \"Don't turn it into angry actions. Love thy neighbour. But vote for your future.\"</p> <p>When it comes to black America in general and Arkansas in particular, Mr Kerry's greatest strength seems to be that he is not Mr Bush; his greatest weakness is that he is not Mr Clinton, who hails from Arkansas.</p> <p>\"I think we were spoiled with Bill Clinton,\" said Mr Charles. The former president's easy personality and southern ways made him a hit with African Americans, the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison once famously describing him as \"our first black president\". Mr Charles added: \"People are picturing someone coming close, so that's tough on Kerry because I don't see any candidate measuring close.\"</p> <p>Mr Clinton's heart condition has kept him away from the campaign trail in the past six weeks. Now he has sufficiently recovered, black Arkansans are hoping he will head home soon to work his magic.</p> <p>Republicans, meanwhile, have been out plying their socially conservative message, leafleting cars outside black churches, reminding voters of their positions on abortion and gay marriage, on which there will be a referendum on polling day. In a community where the church remains the single most powerful mobilising force, their strategy has had some traction but not enough to erase the impression that Republicans stand for the white and the wealthy.</p> <p>\"I know same-sex marriage is totally against the world of God, and I think John Kerry supports it,\" said John Nunn, at his soul-food restaurant near Marvell in the Mississippi Delta. \"But I'm voting Democrat for sure. I don't think Republicans have a clue about poor people.\"</p> <p>When the Democrat president Lyndon Johnson signed the civil rights act in 1964 he told an aide: \"We have lost the south for a generation.\" Forty years on it looks as if they may have lost it for ever.</p> <p>The political realignment of the south and racial realignment of the Democratic party is now virtually complete.</p> <p>The Democrats once dominated the south through their most loyal base, white racists. Now African Americans form the bedrock of their support. Meanwhile Republicans saw an opening by concentrating on the racial fears of whites, post civil rights, in what has become known as Richard Nixon's \"southern strategy\".</p> <p>Now the south is staunchly Republican. Integration of the races has brought about the segregation of the parties - southern whites vote overwhelmingly Republican; most blacks vote Democrat. With the exception of Florida, Arkansas remains the last southern state where the Democrats stand a chance. In 2000, Mr Bush won it by 51% to 46%; the latest poll this year puts the parties even, each on 48%.</p> <p>With six electoral votes at stake in such a close race you would think this would make it a much sought after prize. Other states with fewer votes - Nevada, New Mexico, New Hampshire - are showered with visits and bombarded with ads. But, to the dismay of local Democrats, Mr Kerry has not been here since May. Television ads are few and far between; the yard signs and badges are more scarce. Meanwhile Republican field officers have gone to Colorado, where Mr Kerry is making a strong challenge.</p> <p>\"Arkansas has been devalued,\" said one Democrat insider. \"I think they've given up on the south and that means we're carrying the south on our backs.\"</p> <p>But neither side has pulled out entirely. The Republicans remain a presence with automated phone calls, some ads and local volunteers. The Democrats have several field officers from out of town. \"It's man versus machine,\" said Mr Shelton.</p> <p>In one of the many states where early voting has begun, the scene from the Dunbar community centre last week suggested that it was human endeavour that was winning through. Old, black women in church hats were ferried to the centre two or three at a time; they trooped in and emerged with stickers on their jackets announcing \"I've voted\".</p> <p>As is the case in the rest of the country, most of those who have voted early are in heavily Democratic areas. \"We're dominating the ground game,\" said Mr Shelton. \"And that's where it's going to count.\"</p> <p><b> theguardian.com/uselections2004</b><br></p>",
  "It might not boast the most well-watered greens in the world or the best standard of food and drink at the 19th hole. But Australia's treeless Nullarbor Plain will, within 18 months, play host to the world's largest golf course. <p>The Nullarbor Links will cross three time zones and stretch across 850 miles of barren semi-desert across the flat, featureless landscape spanning the border between Western Australia and South Australia.</p> <p>There will be one hole for each stop along the 850-mile route - from Kalgoorlie, 450 miles east of Perth, to Ceduna, 500 miles west of Adelaide.</p> <p>Even by travelling non-stop at the speed limit, it would take 13 hours to get from one end of the course to the other.</p> <p>\"It's not going to be St Andrews by any stretch of the imagination,\" said Alf Caputo, of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder tourist association. \"But it's going to be something completely unique to this region.\"</p> <p>Around 300 people live permanently along the stretch of road, but thousands more travel across the featureless plain every month, on the main route between Perth and Australia's eastern cities.

A last hurdle to completion of the course was cleared this week when the city council of Kalgoorlie-Boulder gave its approval to the plan.</p> <p>The Nullarbor is a land of superlatives.

  "<b>Lords hunting vote</b> <br> The House of Lords voted overwhelmingly to allow registered hunting with hounds. Voting was 322 to 72, majority 250, during the hunting bill's committee stage. The move, in defiance of the government's bill which outlaws hunting, puts the Lords once more on a collision course with MPs. <p>It came after nearly three hours of emotional and at times angry debate. Environment minister Lord Whitty was pressed repeatedly to spell out the government's position on the bill and if it would use the Parliament Act to steamroller a hunting ban into law. </p> <p>He insisted it was up to the Lords to come up \"with a proposition which is likely to engage the majority in the House of Commons. If not it is you who are putting us on course for the potential deadlock and therefore potential use of the Parliament Act.\" </p> <p>But Labour peer Lord Donoughue, who urged peers to back the amendment, said registration for hunts was a \"constructive compromise,\" and the vast bulk of the new bill was identical to the government's previous bill. </p> <p><b>Use of Parliament Act</b><br> Tempers flared on all sides of the Commons over the possible use of the Parliament Act to force through a ban. Ministers faced a barrage of criticism from MPs. the government was repeatedly warned that invoking the Act would be regarded as an abuse of power. </p> <p>The constitutional affairs minister, Christopher Leslie, said ministers still hoped agreement could be reached, but emphasised that ultimately the will of the Commons must prevail. </p> <p>Oliver Heald, for the Tories, had warned that using the act was a \"massive exercise\" of government executive power. \"It's the parliamentary nuclear option and should only be used sparingly,\" he said. </p> <p><b>Parliamentary language</b><br>Visitors to parliament will no longer be referred to as \"strangers\" but instead \"the public\" after MPs voted to drop the term under modernisation moves. The Commons leader, Peter Hain, dubbed it \"an ancient, medieval practice...we should get rid of\". </p> <p>References to \"strangers\" date back to 1575 and times when the public was barred from scrutinising what went on at Westminster, he said. </p> <p>But the shadow Commons leader, Oliver Heald, warned against \"stripping away the charm and magic\" of parliament. \"The suggestion that not calling members of the public strangers will improve the accessibility of parliament to the public is surely misguided,\" he argued. </p> <p>To some Tory shouts of \"shame!\", voting was 242 to 167, majority 75, to drop the term strangers. </p> <p><b>EU asylum policy</b><br>Britain retains the right to \"opt-in or out\" of European immigration and asylum policy, home secretary David Blunkett insisted. Despite giving up Britain's veto on EU asylum policy, Mr Blunkett said the government was pursuing a \"balanced and sensible\" policy. </p> <p>Answering an emergency question, he said he was proud of the agreement hammered out at Monday's meeting of justice and home affairs ministers in Luxembourg. </p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, warned it was a matter of constitutional importance for Britain to lose the power of veto over asylum and immigration. He accused the government of deliberately employing \"the politics of confusion\" to disguise the impact of the change, which amounted to a \"surrender\" of Britain's ability to control its own borders. </p> <p><b>Future of Scottish regiments</b><br>The government came under fire from MPs again over plans for a major reorganisation of Scottish regiments. Tory Peter Atkinson said there was \"outrage in Scotland at the treatment of the Black Watch and other Scottish regiments\". Plans are being considered to scrap one of Scotland's six infantry regiments and merge the remaining five into a new Scottish \"super regiment\". </p> <p>The Scottish secretary, Alistair Darling, said he was aware of \"people's understandable concern\" about the reorganisation. \"I'm equally aware that many people attach very great importance to maintaining the historic traditions and identities of the Scottish regiments and I hope that is something that will be taken into account\" by the Army Board and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. </p> <p><b>Jaguar production</b><br> Small businesses would be \"largely unaffected\" by controversial proposals to end production of Jaguar cars in Coventry, the government said. Ford has announced that it wants to close the luxury car maker's Browns Lane plant, cutting 1,150 jobs. Local MPs have warned that many other jobs could be affected in the area. But trade minister Jacqui Smith said production would only be moved around 16 miles to Castle Bromwich. </p> <p><b>Climate change</b><br>Tory former chancellor Lord Lawson attacked a \"blood-curdling\" speech by Tony Blair warning about the dangers of climate change. The prime minister called for further investment in new low-carbon technologies to counter the threat. </p> <p>Lord Lawson said: \"The prime minister's blood-curdling remarks about the imminent threat to the people of this country from global warming are probably about as well-founded as his earlier remarks about the imminent threat to them from weapons of mass destruction from Iraq.\" </p> <p><b>Procesed food labelling</b><br> Processed foods should be marked with nutritional labels to prevent people relying on \"guesswork and good luck\", urged Labour's Helen Southworth. She said pre-packaged foods that have been processed in some way should be labelled to give people the fullest information on what they are eating. </p> <p>Nutritional information must be clear, easy to read and \"compare like with like\", she said introducing her prepared foods (provision of information) bill which has no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Plastic bags tax</b><br>There are no plans for a tax on plastic bags despite peers' pleas that it would be good for the planet, the government said. Labour's Lord Dubs said the answer was disappointing. \"Plastic causes enormous death and injury to birds, marine mammals and other forms of wildlife.\" The Irish Republic's tax had reduced plastic bag usage there by 90%. </p> <p>But government spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said although the tax in Ireland was reducing the usage of certain plastic bags \"the more robust plastic bags, which are outside the tax, are used more extensively. </p> <p><b>Cost of anti-war protests</b><br> Policing anti-war protests at RAF Fairford during the Iraq war cost the taxpayer more than \u00a37m. The total bill for policing the Gloucestershire airbase where US B-52 bombers were stationed last year was \u00a37.7m, Home Office minister Hazel Blears said. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br> The Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, and his ministers face MPs at question time. This is followed at noon by questions to the prime minister. MPs then debate the remaining stages of the domestic violence and victims of crime bill. In the Lords, peers continue debate on the committee stage of the hunting bill.</p>",
  "<p>Unilever, the consumer products giant, said today that profits had slipped during the third quarter - as had sales of its top 400 brands.</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch group - which makes products ranging from Magnum ice cream and Lipton Ice Tea to Hellmann's mayonnaise and Dove soap - saw pre-tax profits fall by 2% to \u20ac1.32bn (\u00a3916m) during the three months to September, despite a 2% rise in nine-month profits to \u20ac3.42bn.</p> <p>The company, which saw a 1% drop in sales of its top brands, said poor weather had compounded its problems over the summer, with falling sales of ice cream and iced tea contributing nearly two thirds of a 5% decline in European underlying sales.</p> <p>Total turnover fell 4% to \u20ac10.6bn, with margins coming under pressure from an increase in promotional activity.</p> <p>The results came after Unilever issued a shock profits warning last month, saying its third quarter performance had been weak and full-year earnings growth was likely to be in the single digits.</p> <p>Today it said it would review its targets up to 2010, as its five-year \"Path to Growth\" strategy comes to an end. The plan, drawn up by former chairman Niall FitzGerald in 1999, came with a pledge - subsequently undelivered - to seek 6% to 8% annual growth from leading brands in the years 2000 to 2004.</p> <p>Unilever said the outcome of its review of targets over the next five years would be delivered to shareholders together with its full-year results.</p> <p>Patrick Cescau, who took over as chairman from Mr FitzGerald during the quarter, admitted his group's performance was currently unsatisfactory. \"Actions are being taken to improve the market competitiveness of our products,\" he said.</p> <p>Unilever said sales across the Atlantic were flat due to weak consumer spending, but that sales of SlimFast have stabilised - despite the continued popularity of the rival Atkins diet.</p> <p>In Europe, sales of hair and skincare products such as Sunsilk shampoo and Lux soap increased, but the gains were \"more than offset\" by declines of other brands, particularly in laundry and household cleaning. Sales of frozen foods were also lower, although the group reported growth for its Knorr and Hellmann's ranges.</p> <p>Unilever has pledged to invest more in advertising its leading brands and step up its support behind new products. The company's shares had fallen 6.5p to 443p at 10am.</p>",
  "<p>Bernie Ecclestone's formula one empire was under threat last night after an alliance of car manufacturers announced they would set up a rival world championship series by 2008 to give a fairer financial deal to all the competing teams. </p> <p>GPWC Holdings, which includes BMW, Ferrari Maserati, Renault and DaimlerChrysler, has appointed International Sports and Entertainment AG to work on the operational and commercial structure for a new open-wheel racing series to start no later than 2008. </p> <p>\"We have been more than patient with the management and governance of formula one but recent developments have underlined the need for a structure which guarantees a stable and prosperous future,\" said J\u00fcrgen Hubbert, the former Mercedes-Benz board director who is chairman of GPWC. </p> <p>Up to now, GPWC was seen as little more than a pressure group which Ecclestone found easy to ignore. He now has to decide whether to release more of his commercial-rights income or allow GPWC to show its hand, which could result in a damaging split. </p> <p>Despite repeated undertakings, Ecclestone is accused of failing to comply with key points in an agreement to step up his payments to GPWC's partner teams, including Ferrari, Williams, McLaren and Renault, who feel they make the show. </p> <p>The turning point came in December 2003 when the teams agreed to shelve plans for a separate world championship if Ecclestone offered a better deal. None was forthcoming, so they withdrew from the undertaking in April and continued with their plans. </p> <p>Ever since Ecclestone, in his role as president of the formula one constructors' association, led the teams into a battle with the FIA 23 years ago over who had the right to the income streams, money has dominated the business. </p> <p>In the early 80s formula one was a modest commercial affair compared with today. The team owners regarded Ecclestone as one of them. He had bought Brabham in 1971 for about \u00a3200,000 and the team enjoyed considerable success under his stewardship. </p> <p>More to the point, Ecclestone offered to make the teams rich. He persuaded them to sign up to the Concorde agreement under which they would receive a big cheque every year as their share of commercial rights income. The teams were only too happy to leave the dealing to him. </p> <p>The commercial and administrative framework of formula one has been enshrined in the Concorde agreement since the early 80s, a complex contract which bound together Ecclestone, as the formula one commercial rights holder, the FIA and the competing teams. The sport's commercial-rights income has expanded to levels which nobody could have imagined when the first Concorde agreement was signed. It is estimated that formula one now generates about $800m (\u00a3435m), taking into account TV income ($250m), trackside advertising and corporate hospitality ($200m) and fees paid to Ecclestone by promoters ($370m). </p> <p>Yet the teams' only significant share is a percentage of the TV income, plus about $167,000 a race for turning up, leaving the bulk of their income to be earned by sponsorship deals. </p> <p>In 1997 McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell refused to sign the latest version of the Concorde agreement, believing Ecclestone was not offering a fair deal. Eventually they were persuaded to sign after more money was forthcoming. \"In retrospect we signed under some duress,\" said a McLaren insider. \"We should have pushed for an even better deal, which we would have done if we'd had all the information.\" </p> <p>In simple terms the 10 competing teams share about $117m from annual TV income and the remaining 53% goes to SLEC, the company founded by Ecclestone to exploit the revenues and in which he owns a 25% stake, having raised $3.4bn from a bond issue and the sale of the other 75% in 1999. </p> <p>What really irks the teams, however, is that the FIA granted Ecclestone a 100-year lease of the formula one commercial rights for a fee of $313.6m two years ago, as part of its undertaking to the European Union that it would ensure the commercial and sporting administrations were separated. </p> <p>\"To give you a round figure, the team who win the world championship in the preceding year, versus the team that is last in the world championship the preceding year, receives double the amount of money,\" said Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. \"The money is not huge, in round figures $22m to $11m. Maybe you will be quite surprised at that spread, and that it is relatively equalised.\" </p> <p>In the top-team budgets, this is chicken feed. Ferrari spend almost $400m a year to keep ahead of the field and their president Luca di Montezemolo has warned Ecclestone that the current distribution cannot continue beyond the expiry of the Concorde agreement at the end of 2007. </p> <p>Ecclestone's response is to continue granting long-term contracts to circuit owners to ensure he has them under his wing. Yesterday he was in Cancun, Mexico, where a five-year deal for a grand prix from 2006 was announced.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>SHARON GETS HIS WAY OVER GAZA PULLOUT</b></p> <p>The vote was historic, according to the Guardian and the Independent, while the Herald Tribune describes it as an occasion of \"profound symbolism\". </p> <p>Ariel Sharon won what he called the most important vote of his life last night as the Israeli parliament backed his plan to remove all 21 Israeli settlements from Gaza. Around 8,000 settlers will be affected. It was the first time in 37 years that the Knesset had voted to remove Jewish settlements from Palestinian territories, and the Israeli prime minister said it could pave the way for peace. </p> <p>But the vote on the disengagement plan, which a newspaper poll suggests is supported by 65% of the Israeli public, came after a fraught day of high drama and bitter debate. The IHT also warns that the victory, of 67 votes to 45, \"does not guarantee implementation\" and was narrower than anticipated. The withdrawal is supposed to start next April or May, but there will be further votes.</p> <p>Last night Mr Sharon sacked two of his ministers, Uzi Landau and Michael Ratzon, after they voted against the plan. Today the prime minister is left with a split cabinet and party; almost half of the Likud party opposed the disengagement. Commentators say Mr Sharon will probably have to either put together a new coalition with Labour or call early elections. </p> <p>The Telegraph reports that protestors called Mr Sharon a traitor and \"extremists scrawled graffiti calling for his assassination\". </p> <p>His main rival, the finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu, voted for the plan stony-faced - entering the chamber late to increase the tension - and then demanded a referendum. Mr Sharon rejected this, saying it would just delay the decision. </p> <p>The Guardian hailed the vote as a \"landmark moment for both parties\" against a \"background of unrelieved gloom about the prospects for peace\". </p> <p>The newspaper criticised settlements \"built on confiscated land with swimming pools and beautifully tended lawns behind the barbed wire\" and contrasted them with the poor conditions endured by one and a half million Palestinians. The settlements have no legal or moral justification and \"it is right that they should go\", the Guardian said. </p> <p>The leader concludes: \"Leaving the Gaza strip is a necessary but not sufficient condition to establish peace. Gaza's liberation can be first. It will mean little if it also turns out to be last.\"</p> <p>The Times has a Brooke cartoon entitled Gaza Strip (with figleaf) depicting Mr Sharon taking his clothes off with only a figleaf protecting his modesty. </p> <p>In the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland argued that as Ariel Sharon has become public enemy number one to Israel's far right, he temporarily deserves the support of the left. </p> <p>\"Put simply, the peace camp's plan is Gaza first.

  "<p> <strong> Fairytales, </strong><br> by Hans Christian Andersen, <br> Penguin Classics, \u00a320</p> <p>While I was hunched over Hans Christian Andersen, the roofers called down to say that the timbers were rotten and the whole thing might crash down about our heads. This was bad, I knew, but I was momentarily distracted by worry for little Kai in The Snow Queen, his heart perversely turning to ice. I was back in the huddled childhood trance in which a story could blot out the world. </p> <p>Next year is the bicentenary of Andersen's birth, and his native Denmark will marshal an enthusiastic programme of celebrations. Here in Britain, a smart new translation from Penguin, with an extensive biographical introduction, is truly scrumptious, a proper treasury - weighty, cloth-covered, and illustrated by Andersen's own naive papercuts. These peculiar blobby silhouettes will surely provoke breathless imaginations. </p> <p>The stories are readoutloudable, but the real joy comes when a child can slip into this world alone. Andersen's stories cover a huge emotional and literary range, but he approaches every theme wholeheartedly. Even in a story of crafty derring-do like The Tinderbox, he amplifies the hero's terrified wonder at the magic dogs he meets - dogs with eyes as big as teacups, or whirling wide like mill wheels. </p> <p>This isn't the first children's classic I have re-read in adulthood and wondered how I escaped irreversible trauma. Even so, Andersen palpitates towards extremity. A girl is reduced to a rag by her snickering scarlet shoes; the Snow Queen hurls a young captive through a land spiky with icicles. \"As a little girl I thought he was making me suffer,\" AS Byatt has written. \"I thought he was pushing my mind around.\" Andersen's technique might seem monstrously manipulative if he weren't writing with absolute conviction. </p> <p>His stories maintain a direct access to emotion - he too is scaring himself silly, plunging into eerie misery, longing for consolation. He draws heavily on folk tales and their heedless progress - one darn thing after the next: another peril, another prince, another hopeful wish. Tiny Thumbelina is haplessly presented with a series of icky fianc\u00e9s (clammy toad, killjoy mole). For Andersen's heroines, even walking tugs them further into peril. The little mermaid claims a human soul and keeps dancing, even though every step cuts like a knife; while with one understandably thoughtless act, Karen in The Red Shoes attracts a desperately vicious sentence to which only death can put a full stop. </p> <p>Like the morbid little tyke that I was, I have neglected Andersen's comic zingers: the exuberance of The Emperor's New Clothes (\"But he doesn't have anything on!\"), or the ugly duckling's eventual vindication. The stories have a real charm that nudges inanimate objects, toys and ornaments into plangent life. Andersen's dark side, however, is never far from the surface, and emerges with particular force in The Shadow. Written in the aftermath of a deceptively sunny autobiography, Andersen's anxieties seep into this unnerving tale. A shambling, overeducated failure is gradually elbowed from his own life by his uppity shadow, a smooth and unscrupulous networker who thrives on facile confidence. Read on with eyes big as teacups.</p>",
  "Iraqis campaigning to end the occupation of our country have been shocked to hear the harsh criticisms levelled at the Stop the War coalition by leaders of the trade union Unison and others. It must also be a source of dismay to the many thousands of union and Labour activists who consistently opposed the war of aggression on Iraq and continue to campaign to bring the troops home. <p>This unwelcome diversion follows the Labour conference voting to reject a call for an early date to be set for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. The vote was a blow to the Iraqi people's struggle for liberation and democracy at a critical time in the murderously ruthless occupation of our country. Britain's role might not be decisive militarily, but it is the one country important enough to provide the Bush administration with the fig leaf it desperately seeks to convince the American people that there is international support for its war policies. Tony Blair's propaganda value in the US means that British withdrawal would have a huge impact on the US public. </p> <p>What has startled many anti-occupation Iraqis is that Stop the War, the broadest anti-war mass movement Britain has ever seen, is being criticised for sectarianism. And all because it is refusing to cosy up to an organisation that masquerades as an anti-occupation council of trade unions in Iraq. </p> <p>Outside Iraq, this organisation calls itself the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), but inside the country uses the same name (the General Federation of Workers' Trade Unions in Iraq) as the \"yellow\" unions set up by Saddam Hussein. Paul Bremer, President Bush's proconsul in Iraq until this summer, eventually blessed the decision of his Iraqi Governing Council to recognise one of at least two outfits claiming to take up the mantle of the GFWTUI (and hence legally control its massive assets and individual unions). That outfit is none other than the IFTU of today. But of course it is not the only trade union federation, nor is it recognised by most people attempting to create independent unions as their representative. These include the oil workers union in Basra and the Federation of Workers Councils and Trade Unions. There are also other ad-hoc federations led by Islamists, and Kurdish parties in Iraqi Kurdistan. </p> <p>The question is why the occupation authorities chose to recognise the IFTU as the sole federation in Iraq. The answer is that most IFTU leaders belong to the Iraqi Communist party, which had a proud record under the British-imposed regime in the 1950s and afterwards but which made the mistake of going into government with Saddam's Ba'ath party in the 70s, and since the early 90s has lost its bearings entirely. Within three months of the invasion it switched its official policy to active cooperation with the occupation when it joined Bremer's governing council. Today the party has one senior and two junior ministers in the longtime CIA asset Ayad Allawi's regime. Allawi, himself a former senior Saddamist, also leads a CIA-funded organisation, the Iraqi National Accord, composed of former Saddam loyalists in the armed forces and security services. These now control the key ministries of defence, the interior and national security. </p> <p>Allawi's party and the ICP - whose leader was recently described in the Financial Times as \"the US's ideal partner\" in Iraq - are now close allies. Hence the IFTU's efforts to support Blair's abortive attempt to invite Allawi to address the Labour conference. That should have alerted trade unions and Labour delegates to the role being played by the IFTU and the way it has been used by the Blair government. </p> <p>Abdullah Muhsin, the IFTU's international representative, led the campaign to invite Allawi and pleaded with trade union and Labour delegates not to support the call for an early withdrawal of Britain's forces. Despite his denials, his opposition to the conference resolution calling for an early date for withdrawal was published in the party's daily briefing to delegates and was widely distributed in advance of the debate. </p> <p>Muhsin has been upset at accusations of collaboration. I for one would be happy to drop such an emotive term if someone could suggest a more apposite description of an organisation that: gets backing from the occupation authorities in preference to all other unions and federations; does not campaign within Iraq against the occupation; says not a word about Iraq's real ruler at Saddam's Republican Palace in Baghdad, US ambassador John Negroponte; attacks all those resisting the occupation as terrorists and echoes Bush and Blair in their portrayal of popular resistance to occupation as one and the same as the criminal acts of a hoodlum like Zarqawi; supports the prolongation of the occupation by opposing the setting of an early date for the troops' withdrawal; actively supports an occupation-imposed puppet regime that, following a Bremer decree, enacted Saddam's 1987 law banning strikes and unions in the state sector; and fails to campaign against the US bombardment of Iraqi cities. </p> <p>Now it has emerged that the IFTU has been in discussions with the British Council about accepting funds from the British government - which has invaded and occupied our homeland - to support its activities in Iraq. </p> <p>Instead of accusing them of \"cultural imperialism\", Muhsin and the IFTU should be saluting those in Britain who recognise the legitimacy of the Iraqi people's resistance to an illegal war and occupation, and end their deep involvement with the occupation-appointed authorities. </p> <p>Trade unions and anti-war campaigners need to reject this latest diversion, as Tony Woodley of the transport union has urged, increase the pressure for the withdrawal of British forces and support the Iraqi people's struggle for liberation and democracy. In considering the IFTU leaders' arguments in support of the US-installed Allawi regime, we bear in mind the slogan which is chanted by Iraqis as they gather near homes destroyed by US bombardment, after their tears for the dead and injured give way to anger. It damns Allawi as both a coward and an agent of the US: \"Ya Allawi ya jaban, ya ameel il-Amreekan!\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sami Ramadani was a political refugee from Saddam Hussein's regime and is a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk\">sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In recent months concerted efforts by anti-abortion organisations, and their supporters in the press, have created a frenzy of activity around the emotive and complex issue of late abortion. Massively magnified images of a 12-week foetus and the imputation to it of \"smiling\" and \"walking\" have had a huge impact on the climate of opinion, and are being used to shift emphasis away from the woman to the foetus. Yet the pictures add nothing to medical knowledge nor have there been any other significant technological changes to justify the pressure for change that has been created in response to them. </p> <p>The time limit for abortion is currently 24 weeks, a compromise that balances the needs and rights of women with the understanding that as pregnancy progresses the foetus approaches personhood. In doing so, it reflects that our society neither accepts the absolutist position of the anti-abortion lobby who want to ban all abortions nor, at the other extreme, the views of those who believe in a woman's right to choose at any stage of pregnancy. The pre-25 week foetus, as the Panorama programme Miracle Baby Grows Up demonstrated last month, has very little chance of surviving. In Holland, babies born before 25 weeks are not resuscitated, and it has been suggested that the same policy be introduced here. </p> <p>In 2003, fewer than 1.6% of abortions took place after 22 weeks, which shows just how unusual it is for women to have a late abortion. These are women who have very particular needs: those who decide to terminate a wanted pregnancy because of a foetal abnormality or because their personal circumstances have changed significantly; those who have irregular periods, including the very young or menopausal, and have only just realised they are pregnant; those who go into denial - again these are often the very young; and refugees or asylum seekers, who are unfamiliar with services and contending with many other difficulties. A reduced time limit would force such vulnerable women to continue with their pregnancies against their will. </p> <p>Women who have late abortions for foetal abnormality are treated differently from others who present late. The former are looked after within foetal medicine services, but not the latter. There is a shortage of doctors with the skill to perform late abortions, so it would be logical for all these abortions to be provided within foetal medicine services, especially as the latter group often find it hard to get an abortion at all. </p> <p>The gestation at which an abortion is considered \"late\" varies: in some parts of the country, it is after 12 weeks, in others, 18 or 20. Our helpline regularly takes calls from distraught women who are within the time limit but who have been refused as being \"too late\". These women meet the law's criteria, and are entitled to an abortion. They desperately need a service that will respond to them promptly and with compassion, not one that compounds their difficulties. </p> <p>The current focus on late abortion means that the real issues that women face are hardly being discussed. In 2003, 181,600 women in England and Wales had abortions, 87% of these before 13 weeks. One in five pregnancies ends in abortion and it is estimated that two out of five women will have an abortion. Abortion services are a basic health service, yet they are characterised by inequity, delay and lack of priority. </p> <p>There is a considerable variation in funding of NHS abortion across the country, from a high of over 90% to a low of just 46%. Some areas with the worst NHS provision argue that local women are affluent and prefer to pay, yet this \"choice\" may really be motivated by long waiting times. </p> <p>The greatest inequity in the UK is Northern Ireland, which is not covered by the 1967 Abortion Act. Abortion is legal there, but more restricted than the rest of the UK. As a result, about 2,000 women travel to Britain every year to pay for their abortion. In 2002, fpa mounted a legal challenge in the high court in Belfast ,and the appeal court has recently ruled that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has actively sought to avoid its responsibilities regarding abortion and ought to issue guidance. This ruling has had little coverage in the British media but is of great significance to a great many women in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>It is clearly best for women to have their abortion as soon as possible. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines say there should be no more than a three-week wait from initial referral to the procedure, but fpa recommends a 72-hour target, with one week as a maximum. However, many areas are far from achieving the RCOG standard. </p> <p> Some of the 13% of women who have their abortions after 12 weeks do so because of delays in getting a referral at all, or long waiting times for the abortion itself. Women should not be subject to the terrible distress of waiting for five, six or seven weeks at an already fraught time. </p> <p>The number of abortions carried out before 10 weeks' gestation varies from 10% to nearly 80% across the country. These figures are particularly important because at this stage less invasive methods such as medical abortion (using drugs) and early surgical abortion under local anaesthetic or conscious sedation are particularly appropriate. Not all women are offered these choices and medical abortion accounted for only about 17% of the total number of abortions in 2003. In addition, a very high number of abortions are performed under general anaesthetic compared with other countries. </p> <p>These methods have enormous potential for providing modern, caring, locally-based nurse-led abortion services for women. Our current laws make this impossible because two doctors have to agree to the abortion, it has to be carried out in an NHS hospital or licensed premises and only a registered medical practitioner can perform an abortion. The law needs to be changed so that appropriately trained nurses can carry out early medical and surgical abortions, and do so in general practice or community clinics. </p> <p>In the United States over 200,000 women have had early medical abortions, going to a doctor or clinic for the first drug, which interrupts the pregnancy, and two days later using the second drug, which completes the process, at home. This option is not currently available to women in this country although there does not appear to be any legal reason to deny women this choice. </p> <p>No method of contraception is perfect and human beings are fallible, so abortion services will always remain an essential feature of sexual health services. The challenge is to ensure that services are high quality, woman-centred and fit for the 21st century. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anne Weyman in chief executive of fpa, formerly the Family Planning Association </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:library&amp;information@fpa.org.uk\">library&amp;information@fpa.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Watery graves </strong> </p> <p>The former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, who now runs Green Cross International, has been celebrating Russia's signing of Kyoto, calling it \"energy perestroika\" and \"highly significant\" coming ahead of elections. This week he explained why he turned green: \"When I became a member of the Soviet leadership, many of our achievements lost their lustre because I learned the environmental price we paid. We built many hydro power stations and they produced a lot of energy, but they flooded vast areas. We saw the steeples of the former churches sticking out above the water, and they looked like funeral crosses.\" </p> <p><strong> Green giant </strong></p> <p> Mike Woodin was one of the Green party's most important leaders, a young Oxford academic, councillor and contributor to these pages. His death in July devastated the party, and there were many heartfelt tributes to him at the party conference. There was good news, too. Last week, another Green, Sushila Dhall, won Woodin's seat, which means they now have 62 councillors and a 10% share in local elections. </p> <p><strong> Dirty tricks </strong></p> <p> Wangari Maathai, Nobel peace prize-winning tree planter, has stated yet again that Aids/HIV is a product of western biological warfare. Where does she get such ideas from? A reader of AgBioView, a pro-GM website, writes: \"It began with a disinformation campaign of the SED [the East German Communist party]. It was later used as a fact by the Stasi security service and the Soviet KGB in a disinformation campaign aimed at Africa. Later, Gorbachev apologised to the US for this dirty campaign.\" Perhaps Maathai knows something else, though. </p> <p><strong> Seeds of doubt </strong> Monsanto and the US government claim that GM crops will not contaminate indigenous species but a report leaked to Greenpeace suggests otherwise. It's from the obscure Commission for Environmental Cooperation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and it recommends that all GM maize imports from the US to Mexico should be milled on entry to stop seeds being planted, intentionally or accidentally. Surprise, surprise: the Bush administration has suppressed the report for three months. </p> <p><strong> GM clone </strong> Good to know that the Democrats' presidential contender, John Kerry, is a firm supporter of GM. \"I will push for the acceptance of safe agricultural products in the US and around the world,\" he says. \"The Europeans and other countries should not use this as a pretext to unfairly close their markets to US exports.\"</p>",
  "<p>For many, it is a region set apart from the rest of the north, let alone the rest of England; fiercely proud, often parodied, sometimes insular and over-romanticised - and suspicious of a capital 300 miles away where many still trek for work. </p> <p>Stretching across mountain, moor, national park and spectacular countryside from the Tweed to the Tees, with a dialect in its heartland that many cannot fathom - it has a distinctive heritage and culture going back to St Cuthbert, an emerging patron saint who underpinned the identity of the old Northumbrian kingdom. </p> <p>But for the rest of the country, the north-east is now popularised by the lilting, smooth-tongued, partying stereotype, in the form of the cheeky TV duo, Ant and Dec, rather than a cloth capped, brown ale swilling, chain-smoking, work-shy, sexist, cartoon character. </p> <p>Andy Capp, late of Hartlepool, is long since dead - and old political allegiances could be dying, too, on the back of continuing decline. Jobless figures might be falling around Britain, but at 6% (4.7% nationally) they are rising again in a region labelled the \"geordie nation\" by property magnate Sir John Hall when he was fighting to take over Newcastle United FC in the late 1980s. </p> <p>Old grievances of the south taking all the riches are being rekindled by Hall, a former mining surveyor, evoking the verse of a generation ago when one industry dominated the economy: \"Oh! Wor pit was laid in, and we had nowt to de . . . let's off to Newcassel: Thor's fine things te de - the toon's all astir.\" </p> <p>It is the domination of that industry that has determined the more recent history of the north-east, and its political direction. With 240,000 miners less than 100 years ago, the region's most prominent social historian, Bill Lancaster, says there's a \"racing certainty\" that anyone born in the north-east has some relation to \"carboniferous capitalism\". They might also share a sense of grievance of being marginalised by Whitehall. </p> <p>Against this background, it might be assumed that the prospect of devolution in the north-east would excite the electorate, stirring a new cultural and political renaissance. </p> <p>With varying degrees of enthusiasm, ministers are offering a form of regional government to oversee industrial and economic development, strategic planning, housing, fire and rescue services and, maybe, transport. </p> <p>Other powers could be forthcoming. A few days ago Tony Blair - often considered a devolution sceptic - came to Stockton-on-Tees, not far from his Sedgefield constituency in Durham, to underline the virtues of \"bringing government closer to the people\". What's good for Scotland, Wales, and Greater London, said the prime minister, should be appealing to the north-east as well. </p> <p>But is it? A week before counting begins in an all-postal devolution referendum, there is confusion, growing hostility between opposing camps, and plain indifference. </p> <p>Many who assumed there would be an automatic yes among the 1.9 million electors are slowly realising that regional identity does not translate easily into political expression. </p> <p>\"Sure, there's a very strong shared experience in a region dominated by single industries,\" says Lancaster, director of the centre for northern studies at Northumbria University. \"We are here because of the great northern coalfield. It's a region that has an identity based on a range of cultural factors and practices - dialect, the way you look at the past, shared history - but much of that is latent rather than manifest. It's there, people recognise it, but it doesn't necessarily prompt them into action.\" </p> <p>Like the rest of the country, the north-east appears increasingly anti-politician, with the rallying cry of no campaigners in the referendum striking a chord: \"Politicians talk, we pay.\" </p> <p>Could the north-east, then, follow the example of Wales, which overwhelmingly rejected an assembly in 1979, only to narrowly approve one by less than 1%, 18 years later on the back of New Labour's honeymoon? Today, Blair is far from popular. </p> <p>Other factors are conspiring against the yes campaign, which has mopped up most of the prominent regional personalities, from Hall to the independent mayor of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon. </p> <p>Although the assembly's annual budget of \u00a3500m would be met by Whitehall grant, some of the \u00a325m annual running costs for a 25-member body will have to come from the council tax, or its replacement after a long-awaited revaluation in 2007: an estimated 5p a week for the average taxpayer, say ministers. </p> <p>Combine this with a messy reorganisation of local government in the two-tier counties of Northumberland and Durham, and yes campaigners face an uphill struggle. Ministers have decreed that single-tier unitary authorities, potentially more distant from the people, must go hand in glove with regional government. </p> <p>Society Guardian tested opinion in Durham, likely to be the seat of a regional assembly. The city is rich in north-east symbolism, with its magnificent Norman cathedral containing the tomb of St Cuthbert. John Tomaney, professor of regional government at Newcastle university - and chairman of the yes campaign - says Cuthbert's presence has \"endured as a symbol of the region's cultural and political identity\". </p> <p>Challenging the argument that regional government will be an artificial construct thrust on the north-east, Tomaney points to a long period of self-determination going back to the middle ages. But the destruction of Cuthbert's shrine with the dissolution of the monasteries and the removal to London of the Lindisfarne gospels, created in his honour, made the cathedral a \"metaphor for the ambiguous place of the north-east in English history\". </p> <p>While our straw poll showed some support for an assembly, respondents were worried about cost and the prospect of more politicians, although local government reform will considerably reduce the number of councillors. </p> <p>Bill, a former finance officer, had an open mind until recently. Last week he voted no: \"I looked over the border at the cost of devolution in Scotland and asked if it had done them much good.\" </p> <p>His wife, Mary, a former local government officer, was even more hostile: \"It's hard enough now working out who does what, between councils and the government, and this will just complicate things.\" </p> <p>George Hetherington, a retired music teacher and doyen of the local operatic society, was emphatic: \"It will not achieve anything.\" </p> <p>Such defeatist talk rattles Mallon, who is emerging as the most influential north-east politician. He joined the yes camp late in the day, after studying the arguments for and against. \"It's all about advocacy and influence,\" he insists. </p> <p>He says that at best, the no campaign has been disingenuous. \"They keep going on about cost and the lack of powers. They misrepresent everything. The assembly will coordinate government resources, make quangos accountable, make the north-east one.\" </p> <p>But Lancaster is not so upbeat. He says big prestige cultural projects by the Tyne obscure one reality. </p> <p>\"We have not had a cultural renaissance and we have not got a political class, like the Scots. OK, we've got the Blairs and the [Alan] Milburns, but they don't really connect with the region.\" </p> <p><strong>What the locals say</strong></p> <p><strong> Tim Healy</strong> </p> <p>Actor, born in Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>It's always been a bit like England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and then the geordies. I've always been proud to be a geordie. It means sticking together and seeing the good side of a situation. Until TV programmes like The Likely Lads and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, nobody knew anything about the north-east or what geordie people were like ... the humour, optimism and toughness that makes geordies what we are. We look after each other through tough times. My home was rows of terrace houses, and football in the streets. We all used to have bonfires in our back yards every night and at the top of the street it looked like lines of beacons. I lived in one of the last areas to have gas lamps - I used to shin up them to light my cigarettes, and usually got a hiding. </p> <p>Now the docks have closed, lottery money has transformed the city. It's like Blackpool was when I was a lad - a place where you knew you'd have a good time. Newcastle just seems to want to party. </p> <p><strong> Bea Campbell</strong> </p> <p>Writer and broadcaster, born in the Borders, lives in Newcastle</p> <p>I have complicated feelings about it [regional identity]. The north is no more homogenous than the south - the south could be Eastbourne or Brixton. The idea of the north is sustainable in one very sharp sense: that it isn't the south. The south is power, wealth, the political centre, a self-absorbed and complacent locale from which the north, for good reason, feels estranged. Compared with Leeds or Manchester, what you've got is breathtaking whiteness. I've never got over that and I don't like it. If there's a strong black presence in a city, it signifies challenge and change. </p> <p>The north is a metaphor for class. I still feel the working class is the majority class; full of resilience, stamina and wit, but it also has to recover from horrible macho politics. </p> <p>The north-east has suffered from the sense that its heroism is linked with industries founded on exclusion of women and black people - mining, shipbuilding, engineering. These things in the north-east's ideology constitute the north-east. Well, excuse me! What about all the mams and school dinner ladies - the women who make the world go round? </p> <p>People probably think they're from Tyneside before they think they're English, and they love their identity. Geordies are in love with themselves. </p> <p><strong> Jack Charlton</strong> </p> <p>Football legend, born and living in Northumberland </p> <p>It's the most beautiful county in England. And I'm proud of it. I like Newcastle, I like geordies - they're always very nice people. And I like fishing. The Tyne is the best salmon river in England. </p> <p>In Northumberland, we've got a coastline that's second to none. The only thing we lack is sun - and a bit less wind. We've got more castles than anyone in the world. I'm thinking very distinctly of Northumberland. I don't live in Co Durham. I've nothing against it but this is prettier. </p> <p>I worked as a boy in the mines for seven months and my father was there for 47 years. The furthest he ever got away was to Filey [north Yorkshire seaside resort]. I don't think I would have wanted to live here if the mines were still going. But the county's developed amazingly. They've cleaned up every pit heap. It's all gone. It's all landscaped. </p> <p>I was born in Northumberland and I'll probably die in Northumberland, and it will be a pleasure to do so. </p> <p><strong> Peter Barron</strong> </p> <p>Editor, Northern Echo, born Teesside </p> <p>When people who don't know it talk about the north-east, they expect an industrial wasteland, but I think it is beautiful countryside. </p> <p>There is a lot of fragmentation but wherever people are from, what they all have in common is a fierce pride and passion, born out of the industrial heritage - and football underlines all that. There's this intense rivalry between different areas but when they talk to outsiders, they'll say, 'I'm from the north-east.' </p> <p>I'm from Teesside and my dad's a steelworker. You have these rivalries within the region ... the Mackems [people from Sunderland] and the geordies. They call people from Teesside 'Smoggies', because of the industrial smog - an almost friendly derogatory term. </p> <p>It's sad that regional pride only shines through when we're living away from the region. It's an anomaly that [here] the sense of regionalism doesn't come through. In that context, the regional assembly is trying to capture that identity. </p> <p>The other day, a big development company flew in from Dubai. It was met by five district councils, all vying for attention. There are these local authorities with internal rivalries. There isn't a regional view, which the assembly might give us. </p> <p><strong> Donna Air</strong> </p> <p>TV presenter and actor, born in Newcastle </p> <p>Coming from the north-east is something in my blood. There's an energy, a motivation and a work ethic that comes from my northern roots. I feel a strong sense of pride, which is a dominant characteristic of the area - and we all like to work hard. </p> <p>What defines the place for me is the character of the city [Newcastle] and its energy. In everything, from football to the arts, there's a lot of creativity and a real lust for life. </p> <p>I see myself as a geordie, and I'm proud to be a geordie. But I think attitudes have changed and people feel they're more of a region. </p> <p>I've never met anyone who doesn't love the geordie accent - it has a lovely rhythm and it's quite musical. But people have the stereotype of these big, lardy Viz characters, or Andy Capp, and that all Newcastle girls are really up for it. I think that's funny, and I don't get offended. Most girls I know from the north-east are up for a good time. </p> <p>It's my home and I love it. The best thing about it is the strength and energy. It made me what I am today.</p>",
  "<p>Real men wear pink. Not fuchsia or acid pinks - \"the equivalent of wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt\" - but \"your old-fashioned Wall's strawberry ice-cream colour\", according to Jo Adams in the <strong>Observer</strong>. </p> <p>Any item of pink clothing is fair game for the fashion-conscious male if he adheres to a few simple rules, Adams advised. \"Avoid ending up like a City boy trying to do casual; never go near the combination of ruffles and pink; keep it classic and simple.\" </p> <p>Jude Law's Alfie has made it acceptable to display masculinity with this traditionally feminine colour. Indeed, the <strong> Daily Telegraph</strong>'s Jim White was so taken with Law's wardrobe in the cinematic remake that he took the plunge himself and \"walked down the street in warm tones of freshly boiled lobster\". </p> <p>Of course, it happened first in America. Over the pond, men everywhere are head to toe in pink, claimed Tanika White in the <strong> Philadelphia Inquirer</strong>: \"Rappers, politicians, business types, inner-city boys on the bus - all dressed in bubble gum, cotton candy, sunset pinks.\" Even presidential hopeful John Kerry \"has been spotted in pink ties\". </p> <p>The \"carefree colour\" has made its way to coats and boots, too, and pink trainers are \"so hot\" that men have been spotted \"standing in line to buy women's shoes\", reported Nara Schoenberg in the <strong> Chicago Tribune</strong>. But why now? \"Uneasy times call for upbeat colours,\" Schoenberg mused. </p> <p>Pink was spearheaded in the US by hip-hop artists, said the New York <strong> Daily News</strong>. But it is Harlem rapper Cam'ron Giles who deserves particular credit. He went further than most by sporting \"a pink cell phone\" and \"a pink Range Rover\". </p> <p>Yet the pink tides are changing just as soon as they have arrived on our shores. Cam'ron declared himself \"over\" the colour in the <strong> New York Times</strong> last week. \"He wants to move on,\" reported Jon Caramanica, and \"plans to adopt a new colour\". Although Cam'ron was \"cagey\" about what that would be, Caramanica judged it was possible to make \"an educated guess\": his new album, released in December, is called Purple Haze.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Author of the month Meg Cabot</strong></p> <p><strong> The Princess Diaries: Sixsational, </strong><br> by Meg Cabot,<br> Macmillan, \u00a39.99<br> </p> <p> \"Wow! a real English kitchen, this is so cute!!!\" Meg Cabot, author of the mega-selling Princess Diaries, has arrived, trailing exclamation marks in her wake. A real princess, in the pea sense, she has come to my house to be interviewed, because it's easier for me, without a wisp of prima donna behaviour. </p> <p>Today's book aristocracy wears pink cowboy boots, judging by Cabot. Boots for which she scoured the internet (<a href=\"http://www.zappos.com\">zappos.com</a>), a simple belt with a huge silver crown for a clasp, floaty pink tops and diamond earrings that would also pass the pea test. </p> <p>Indiana-born, but living in Florida now, Cabot came to London this month to hand out awards for Bliss magazine's short story competition - the sort of thing, she says, that never happened to her as a teenager: \"Are you kidding? I never won. The greatest thing that happened to me recently was that 17 Magazine's fiction competition asked me to be a judge!!!\" Cabot's mother won a prize in 17 Magazine's competition, finishing ahead of a then unknown Sylvia Plath. \"So I was like, 'My mom won, so I should,' and I entered every year and lost.\" </p> <p>Now 36, Cabot only started sending her work out to publishers after her father died, in his 50s, 10 years ago. She was working as a kind of matron, supervising college girls in the dormitories at New York University, and writing in her free time. She went through several years of rejections, and, like Jo in Little Women, made money out of writing trashy romances (which she refuses to name, and won't let her publishers unearth), before finally finding a British buyer for the teen fairytales that have made her famous. </p> <p>Although it was British publishers who first took on The Princess Diaries, the back current of Cabot's stories really make better sense to American sensibilities. She writes about girls, who, like herself, weren't cheerleader types, preferred black clothes to pristine Abercrombie and Fitch, and were into art, drama and music instead of schoolwork. I'm not sure that would translate as a misfit over here, but the reversal-of-fortune nature of the stories, in which the hard-done-by teenager gets to exact all her revenge by having the best life possible, and be graciously condescending, certainly makes sense on both sides of the Atlantic if sales are anything to go by. </p> <p>Cabot kept diaries as a girl and has plundered them ruthlessly for the series. \"My diaries are, like, sooo funny,\" she giggles. \"Like, one day I write, 'I've got the most enormous zit, and grandma's gone into hospital today.' And you know, both things are equally important.\" </p> <p>The NYU girls also provided plenty of material. \"The girls would pee in each others' contact lens solutions and put Nair (hair-removing cream) in the girls' shampoo. They were, like, so mean, just underhand and horrible. Very spoilt. NYU is, like, one of the most expensive schools in the country.\" </p> <p>Cabot's own dream-come-true ending happened while she was still sitting at her desk at NYU - although it wasn't exactly a fairytale. Her agent thought the first Princess Diary had movie potential, and Disney optioned it. First came a $4,000 cheque (laughable now), and then the phone-calls. </p> <p>\" 'We're really sorry, but in the movie we're going to kill off the father, cos Julie Andrews wants to play the grandmother, but she doesn't have enough lines so we're going to kill the dad and give her all the dead dad's lines. Is that OK?' And I was like, Julie Andrews, yeah, you can kill the dad, whatever you have to do!\" </p> <p>The next call was: \"Gary Marshall is gonna direct but he lives in San Francisco and his grandchildren are living out there, and he's doing it for them really, so we have to move the set from New York to San Francisco.\" </p> <p>They weren't so much \"Is this OK?\" calls as \"We're letting you know\" calls, she says wryly, but she's close enough still to the change in her circumstances to laugh happily about the fact that the larger cheques that started arriving - \"Whadda they call it? The 'low-to-mid hundreds of thousands' [less than she's getting now that the series has proved its staying power]\" - went a great way towards compensating for compromised artistic sensibilities. </p> <p>The second Princess Diaries film has just gone into cinemas, and more are in the pipeline, but Cabot says she doesn't have the films in mind when she writes now, that the two universes are completely separate - a feeling confirmed last year when she was sacked as a screenwriter on one of the films of her books. She has taken the experience in her stride, but it does probably mean that the people who fired her are heading for a severe downturn in their fortunes some time soon - round about the evening Cabot wins an Oscar for her latest screenplay.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Princess Diaries: Sixsational can be ordered p&amp;p-free from the Guardian book service on 0870 836 0875, as can all books on these pages. </p> <p><strong>Kids' classics Hans Christian Andersen's Fairytales</strong></p> <p> <strong> Fairytales, </strong><br> by Hans Christian Andersen, <br> Penguin Classics, \u00a320<br> </p> <p>While I was hunched over Hans Christian Andersen, the roofers called down to say that the timbers were rotten and the whole thing might crash down about our heads. This was bad, I knew, but I was momentarily distracted by worry for little Kai in The Snow Queen, his heart perversely turning to ice. I was back in the huddled childhood trance in which a story could blot out the world. </p> <p>Next year is the bicentenary of Andersen's birth, and his native Denmark will marshal an enthusiastic programme of celebrations. Here in Britain, a smart new translation from Penguin, with an extensive biographical introduction, is truly scrumptious, a proper treasury - weighty, cloth-covered, and illustrated by Andersen's own naive papercuts. These peculiar blobby silhouettes will surely provoke breathless imaginations. </p> <p>The stories are readoutloudable, but the real joy comes when a child can slip into this world alone. Andersen's stories cover a huge emotional and literary range, but he approaches every theme wholeheartedly. Even in a story of crafty derring-do like The Tinderbox, he amplifies the hero's terrified wonder at the magic dogs he meets - dogs with eyes as big as teacups, or whirling wide like mill wheels. </p> <p>This isn't the first children's classic I have re-read in adulthood and wondered how I escaped irreversible trauma. Even so, Andersen palpitates towards extremity. A girl is reduced to a rag by her snickering scarlet shoes; the Snow Queen hurls a young captive through a land spiky with icicles. \"As a little girl I thought he was making me suffer,\" AS Byatt has written. \"I thought he was pushing my mind around.\" Andersen's technique might seem monstrously manipulative if he weren't writing with absolute conviction. </p> <p>His stories maintain a direct access to emotion - he too is scaring himself silly, plunging into eerie misery, longing for consolation. He draws heavily on folk tales and their heedless progress - one darn thing after the next: another peril, another prince, another hopeful wish. Tiny Thumbelina is haplessly presented with a series of icky fianc\u00e9s (clammy toad, killjoy mole). For Andersen's heroines, even walking tugs them further into peril. The little mermaid claims a human soul and keeps dancing, even though every step cuts like a knife; while with one understandably thoughtless act, Karen in The Red Shoes attracts a desperately vicious sentence to which only death can put a full stop. </p> <p>Like the morbid little tyke that I was, I have neglected Andersen's comic zingers: the exuberance of The Emperor's New Clothes (\"But he doesn't have anything on!\"), or the ugly duckling's eventual vindication. The stories have a real charm that nudges inanimate objects, toys and ornaments into plangent life. Andersen's dark side, however, is never far from the surface, and emerges with particular force in The Shadow. Written in the aftermath of a deceptively sunny autobiography, Andersen's anxieties seep into this unnerving tale. A shambling, overeducated failure is gradually elbowed from his own life by his uppity shadow, a smooth and unscrupulous networker who thrives on facile confidence.

  "<p>Once upon a time, just a few months ago as a matter of fact, adhering to the low-carbohydrate Atkins regime generally meant, yes, shunning carbohydrates. Not any more: now you can go lower-carb without doing anything as boring, drastic or predictable as actually giving up carbs. </p> <p>Courtesy of a food and drink industry that is hurriedly revamping products to cash in on the diet craze, back on to the menu have come pasta, ice cream and beer, along with famous brands including Hovis, Hellmann's and Kit Kat. October has been typical of the pace at which foods and drinks restyled as low-carb are being launched in Britain: in this short period, three new products have been introduced - two breakfast cereals by the specialist producer Carbolite (which is using more nuts, and replacing sugar with artificial sweetener) and a new chocolate bar with added nuts from another transatlantic low-carb producer, Atkins Nutritional. Last week saw the arrival of a carb-reduced ice cream from a British company called Go Lower, which uses a non-sugar sweetener and more fruit. </p> <p>Many of the new products are from specialist companies set up to achieve the commercial feat of letting followers of Atkins-style diets have their carbs and eat them too. But an increasing number are famous-name products that have been reformulated, or rebranded, with the aim of getting a slice of the low-carb market. </p> <p>Initially, the reduced-carb items brought across the Atlantic by the specialist producers - snacks, shakes, and chocolate, for example - won space in health-sector shops: Boots, Superdrug, Holland &amp; Barrett. But over the summer, the supermarkets have all bought in to the trend. Meanwhile, mainstream food producers including Nestl\u00e9 Rowntree, Unilever and Allied Bakeries have all joined in the rush. </p> <p>The result is that low-carb versions of Nestl\u00e9's Rolos and Kit Kat are now to be found in the health and wellbeing aisles in the majority of supermarkets. The next confectioner to follow will be Guylian of Belgian, which has developed a low-carb Belgian milk chocolate bar that is about to go on sale in Woolworths on trial until January. </p> <p>Like many of the Atkins Nutritional and Carbolite products, Nestl\u00e9's and Guylian's low-carb newcomers maintain their sweet kick by replacing standard sugars such as glucose and sucrose, with polyols - also called \"sugar alcohols\". Polyols are a form of carbohydrate but the manufacturers say that they do not affect blood sugar levels and therefore don't count towards the \"net effective carb\" total. Other alterations to confectionery include replacing the milk in chocolate with milk proteins and milk fats to remove sugar (lactose) derived from milk. </p> <p>Marketing bread as low-carb might seem as if it's the ultimate impossibility, but Hovis is having a go. Its maker, British Bakeries, launched a reduced-carb bread called Nimble Carbs So Low in February but took a bigger step last month by throwing its flagship brand - in the form of a Hovis Best with Less loaf - into the mix. </p> <p>British Bakeries says that both new loaves contain 25% less carbohydrate than standard bread, achieved by replacing some starch content with fibre. Hovis's head of marketing, Darren Grivvell, predicts that annual sales will pass \u00a340m within three years, and that the reduced-carb bread market will be worth \u00a370m within five. </p> <p>The biggest splash is likely to be made by Unilever. The company, which has seen its Slim Fast brand struggle in the era of low-carb, launched a range of 17 grocery products this month - from soup and salad dressings to pasta and cooking sauces - under the Carb Options banner. And with a big advertising push to support the launch, Unilever is bidding to repeat its success in the United States, where the company says Carb Options is on track to generate first-year sales of \u00a355m. </p> <p>Nestl\u00e9's low-carb brand manager for Britain, Claire Hebron, says that people are \"crying out\" for low-carb versions of their favourite brands. She also believes that big brands such as Kit Kat lend \"credibility\" to dieting: it becomes not just a crank thing. But does it also become not really a diet thing? </p> <p>For food makers, the commercial attraction of low-carb looks irresistible at the moment. The research group Mintel has been the first to quantify the size of the UK low-carb market at \u00a3280m for the current year. This is based on the assumption that 40% of the UK's 1.35 million low-carb \"lifestylers\" (a conservative number: many estimates put the figure at 3 million) spend \u00a310 a week on specialised low-carb foods. </p> <p>Another reason that the market is lucrative is that low-carb dieters seem prepared to pay a premium for products that taste good to them. For example, Unilever is placing a 25%-33% price premium on its Carb Options range. This means that if it charged \u00a31 for regular Hellmann's mayonnaise, it would price the low-carb version at \u00a31.25 or more. </p> <p>Nestl\u00e9 is charging a seemingly extortionate price of 79p for a two-finger low-carb Kit Kat, and \u00a31.49 for a pack of Rolos. So far, the pricing strategy seems to be working. According to the company, combined sales of the low-carb duo broke the \u00a31m barrier last month, 10 weeks after their launch in early July. </p> <p>In the US, it is commonplace to see well-known food and drink brands in low-carb formats to cater for the estimated 32-44 million Americans following a low-carb lifestyle. Carb-crunching brand extensions include Ben &amp; Jerry's Carb Karma Ice Cream, Pepsi Edge, Coca-Cola C2, Doritos Edge, Tropicana Light 'n' Healthy and Heinz One Carb Ketchup. But don't expect to see all of them over this side of the Atlantic. Heinz UK brand director Scott Garrett says that One Carb ketchup will not be launched in the UK in its present form. \"We have a programme in the UK to improve the nutritional content of our products, and artificial additives are a no-no. One Carb contains artificial sweeteners.\" </p> <p>However, reformulating a product to fit Atkins criteria is not always necessary; a simple rebranding exercise can do the trick. Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries relaunched its Marston's Low C beer in March. Developed in the 1960s for diabetics, Low C had been suffering from a steady sales decline in recent years. But the brewer found an answer by rebranding the beer as Marston's Resolution Low-Carb Strong Beer and highlighting its carb content of 1.65g per bottle. According to the company, year-on-year sales have soared by 35%. Tamworth-based Green Top Snacks has gone for a similar strategy by rebranding its pork-rind snack, which is naturally low in carbohydrate, as Low-Carb Crunch. </p> <p>The future of the low-carb market in the UK will probably depend on the major supermarkets continuing to buy in to this sector by expanding what they stock. Rob Ellert, the UK-based managing director of Carbolite Europe, describes 2004 as a low-carb toe-dipping exercise for the supermarkets. \"At the beginning of the year the large retailers were confused, and no one got terribly excited. But we're starting to see the first moves by the supermarkets, which should manifest in time for the main slimming season in January.\" </p> <p>Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Waitrose have all introduced branded low-carb lines to their slimming aisles, while Marks &amp; Spencer has set up \"no carb, low carb\" areas in some stores and introduced a \"low carb\" label to flag up low-carb options. </p> <p>Waitrose has led the way by stocking 48 specialised low-carb products, Asda has 37 and Tesco and Sainsbury's have 20. And they all have plans to increase these ranges over the coming months. There are persistent rumours that the supermarkets are desperately seeking own-label suppliers of low-carb items. And Tesco was discovered last month trying to register \"Carb Conscious\" as a trademark, although it insists that it has no immediate own-label plans. </p> <p>But it could be that the demand for low-carb products declines as fast as it grew. In the US, people's interest in low-carb already seems to be diminishing. A survey by bankers Morgan Stanley discovered that the number of US adults on a low-carb lifestyle fell from 12% during the first quarter of this year to 10% during the second quarter - and it forecasts that the decline will continue. The number of low-carb product launches has also plummeted from a high of 622 in June to 227 in September, according to US-based new product monitor Productscan Online. Serious food for thought among those hoping for a bonanza in Britain.</p>"
