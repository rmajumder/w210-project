  "I have only once been to a county cricket match; I have never been again. The problem was that, from the stands, I couldn't see the ball. That didn't matter, my companion told me, because you can infer the presence of the ball from the body language and movements of the players. In that case, I asked him, why have a ball at all? <p>The same thought went through my mind in the early hours of Friday morning, just after the first American presidential debate had finished. As the candidates left the stage at the University of Miami, the camera cut to the BBC's correspondent Katty Kay in the nearby press-room. 'What's going to happen in this room in the next hour,' she told us, 'as both candidates send their teams out to speak to the media is going to have a huge impact on how voters decide how this debate went.' </p> <p>It didn't really matter what Bush and Kerry had said or how they had said it; what mattered was whose version of what they'd said and how they'd said it the media would pass on to the people of America. </p> <p>This bizarre circularity was already being breached, however. Within minutes, Reuters was reporting from St Anselm's College in Manchester, New Hampshire, where seven voters had been watching the debate. Three were for Bush and stayed for Bush, three were for Kerry and stayed for Kerry, but the seventh, one Adam Schibley, now said he was leaning strongly toward Kerry. </p> <p>Early analysis concentrated on the bodies, not the ball. Kerry had won the cutaway campaign, said those who'd watched it splitscreen on C-Span. He took notes when Bush spoke, whereas Bush variously grimaced, winced, smirked or almost shook his head while Kerry was talking. Within hours, the Democratic National Committee had released a video of Bush's cutaways. </p> <p>I thought Bush looked a bit scared while Kerry was right at home. Once again, with his height, booming voice and dense hair, the senator reminded me of a tree, while the prehensile lips and small button eyes of the President have always suggested a small monkey to the cartoonists of the world. At one difficult moment, you half expected Bush to run up Kerry's trunk and take refuge in the topmost foliage, far above the carping, difficult world. </p> <p>The simian image ended at looks. Bush will have surprised jaundiced Europeans by getting his countries right, recalling what the US had done in Liberia and knowing that, in Darfur, 'the rainy season will be ending soon'. It was Kerry, strangely enough, who erred, locating the cells of the KGB headquarters in Moscow as being 'under Treblinka Square'. He must have meant under the Lubianka or under Dzerzhinsky Square - Treblinka was a Nazi extermination camp. </p> <p>BUush was more religious and emotional, climbing a mountain to see the valley of peace and tearing up with a war widow; Kerry was more incisive and analytical. But their tasks had been delineated long before Thursday night. In a piece written for the latest issue of Atlantic Monthly, James Fallows predicted that each would have a single message. 'George Bush will try in his every answer to convey, \"I am a wartime President, and I am strong.\" John Kerry will try to convey, \"You don't know what you are doing and you are weak.\"' </p> <p>So they did. 'He changes positions and you can't change positions in the war on terror if you want to win,' charged Bush. 'Mixed messages send the wrong signals.' 'You can be certain and be wrong,' replied Kerry. Or, as a Democratic strategist said on Friday: 'Go back through the transcript and you'll see it boils down to four words: more of the same. Kerry is a new direction for the future and Bush seems stuck in the past and doesn't acknowledge the troubles.' </p> <p>Given the need for the candidates simultaneously to avoid making a big mistake, to have their body speak the correct language, and for them to repeat the core, boiled-down message, perhaps we Brits shouldn't pay too much attention to what was actually said. Who, after all, remembers what was promised in the Gore/Bush debates of 2000? I certainly don't. </p> <p>And the situation is the situation. Whatever Kerry says he would or would not have done in Iraq (the invasion of which he compared to conquering Mexico because of Pearl Harbor), the fact is that the coalition is there, the violence is happening and the elections are planned for January, the month when a President Kerry would be inaugurated. What can we tell from the debate about the way this potential new head of state might behave? </p> <p>'Under Bush,' said Kerry, 'the best case scenario - what we have now. Worst case scenario - civil war. I can do better.' Or, as he put it for the benefit of US troops in Iraq: 'My message is: help is on the way!' </p> <p>What help? Take this passage from Kerry. 'Today, we are 90 per cent of the casualties and 90 per cent of the cost: $200 billion - $200 bn that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.' The suggestion here, repeated elsewhere during the debate, is that Kerry will reduce the cost in men and materials by getting more allies to sign up for duty in Iraq, presumably during the post-election period. The troops are to be saved not by the US, but by the German cavalry. </p> <p>Yet, though he cited failures in Afghanistan (leaving Bush to comment on the scale of voter registration there), Kerry never allowed that perhaps the greatest failure has been that of Nato countries to provide the peacekeepers they had promised. So he replaced one illusion - that things are basically all right - with another, that 'help is on the way'. </p> <p>And if it isn't, what will President Kerry do to get his fire stations, health care and prescription drugs? Withdraw? And if he faces other challenging situations, how far will he be guided by the political and economic requirements to build almost consensual coalitions? On Sudan, he said there was, indeed, another genocide, and: 'We could never allow another Rwanda.' But how would 'we' stop it? If he has followed the painful progression of the matter of Darfur through the United Nations, he must know that some other countries, like Dickens's Circumlocution Office, are dedicated to the business of not getting things done. </p> <p>And this takes me to what was the most worrying part of Kerry's thinking, as revealed in Miami. 'You know, the President's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra,' Kerry told viewers approvingly. 'And the reason he didn't is because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. That's exactly where we find ourselves today.' </p> <p>Quite so. So, instead, he allowed the Shia and Kurdish rebellions to be crushed and the result was 12 years of crippling sanctions, of bombings to enforce the no-fly zones, of non-compliance with UN resolutions and, of course, of Saddamite state terror. Of course, there were no cameras there, except when the Baath command wanted there to be, no visitors except when Saddam allowed in his tame Galloways. Was that, as Kerry was never asked, good policy, because no US troops died, though hundreds of thousands of Iraqis did? And what did that stoke up for the future? </p> <p>There are a thousand reasons for hoping that John Kerry wins the election in November, not least because of the chance of cooling the Anti-American fever in much of the world. But I will also want to know that he sees the same hard ball flying through the air that I see.</p>",
  "<p>Sit down if you have shares in Sainsbury's. The news just got worse. Hard on the heels of Sir Peter Davis's \u00a33.8 million pay-off, regarded by many as a 'reward for failure', comes another astonishing multi-million-pound payment approved by Sainsbury's board of directors. </p> <p>This one was to a man you have never heard of because he has never worked a day for the company. Michael Dean has received \u00a33m and is in line for up to \u00a37m more. He may be Britain's luckiest small businessman for he was in the right place when Sainsbury's property development team came knocking. </p> <p>The supermarket decided it had to speculate to accumulate, and Dean's property was the gamble it took. It was prepared to bet almost \u00a310m on a run-down, four-storey corner shop with flats above in the belief that it would unlock access to central London's last superstore development. As a public planning inquiry last week showed, it may prove to have been an expensive flutter. </p> <p>For context, remember how critical property is to retailers' fortunes. Remember that many retail experts trace Tesco's dominance to its property team's canny buying in the late Eighties and early Nineties. Property is central to thriving and surviving in the business of selling beans and bank accounts. </p> <p>So why did Sainsbury's write a post-dated cheque of up to \u00a310m for a corner shop, and how did it happen that this property could turn out to be valueless? </p> <p>Number 283 Edgware Road has been problematic since Westminster City Council agreed 15 years ago in principle to the regeneration of a large site opposite Paddington Green police station. The owner, Dean, rejected repeated offers for his property from Waterfront Finance, the developers who then controlled the site, a car park since 1994. </p> <p>At some point the site, which the council wanted to see developed with homes, shops and a large supermarket, came to Sainsbury's attention. By the end of the Nineties Sainsbury's had a close relationship with Waterfront. There was talk of a joint project. Public inquiry documents show that only Dean and his demands for \u00a320m stood in the way. </p> <p>His property had become crucial because the planners wanted to use the opportunity of redevelopment to widen Edgware Road, one of the key routes into central London from the north. The issue of widening has become inextricably linked to the future of the development and has led to several planning applications being rejected. </p> <p>As Sainsbury's told the inquiry, it had been trying to buy number 283 since 1999 'to avoid the ransom position that the owner of that property was using'. Dean's price for outright sale was too high, so Sainsbury's negotiated an option on the property. The contract shows it agreed an upfront fee of \u00a32.6m in October 2002 with an option to buy for \u00a35.6m with an expiry date of 2007. For every quarter that the option is not exercised, Dean receives an interest payment pegged to HSBC base rates, which shall not be less than the equivalent of 5 per cent of the purchase price per annum. </p> <p>Interestingly, a full 10 months before the option was approved by Sainsbury's board Westminster City Council's minutes record that it did not seek a compulsory purchase order for Dean's property because officers did not think they would get one. Even at that stage, the conclusion was that number 283 was not essential to the area's redevelopment. But alarm bells failed to ring and the Sainsbury's deal was done, as it believed the site was critical to road widening, a sticking point in planning discussions. </p> <p>Then the goal posts moved. Waterfront Finance decided to sell the site in 2002. Sainsbury's bid for it, but lost out to West End Green Properties (WEPG), a company headed by a Greek Cypriot, Andreas Soteriou, who was prepared to pay the same price without conditions. </p> <p>WEGP set about tackling the blocks to development. Sainsbury's reaction, as correspondence shows, was first to try to get into bed with WEGP, then to do a deal that compensated Sainsbury's for the money it spent on the Dean property and then to offer for the whole site. Essentially, Sainsbury's wanted to use what it thought was its trump card to secure the superstore site. </p> <p>WEGP's attitude hardened, particularly as it received unsolicited calls from other food retailers and realised that it could command 'previously unseen levels' of rent and premiums for 'the last large foodstore site of its kind in central London'. </p> <p>'WEGP do not consider having to pay for Dean and not receiving a positive premium to be a market proposal,' the minutes of one meeting record. </p> <p>For as long as road widening was an essential part of planners' demands, with number 283 included, Sainsbury's had a negotiating position. Then the authorities shifted their stance. Several times. The public inquiry, from the planning authorities' viewpoint, is now more about the height of the proposed adjoining residential tower, WEGP's contribution to Westminster's social and community fund, and traffic than it is about the number 283 'bulge'. </p> <p>Any hope that Sainsbury's could appeal to WEGP to do a deal looks slim. The developer's adviser noted: 'The substantial confusion and planning problems Sainsbury's had caused had not endeared the owners to them.' </p> <p>And what of Dean, whose British Virgin Islands-registered company is earning at least \u00a3280,000 interest a year under the option contract while the issue is thrashed out? </p> <p>Is he happy? Not really. He is furious that his property is no longer central to redevelopment. His lawyer said: 'Mr Dean feels that the rug has been pulled from under his feet. [He] feels very badly let down by the stance now taken by WCC and Transport for London. The position is highly unsatisfactory.' </p> <p>Yet even if Sainsbury's does not buy his property, he is guaranteed \u00a31.25m, or twice the market value, whichever is the greater, by WEGP. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's, desperate to recoup its outlay, is resisting the proposals on traffic and design grounds and insisting that number 283 is an essential part of the redevelopment. It threatened on Friday to seek judicial review if the inquiry recommends approval of WEGP's plans. </p> <p>Planning inquiry outcomes are notoriously difficult to predict. Sainsbury's chances of winning the Edgware Road prize are anybody's guess. Put it this way: You would not bet \u00a310m on it... or even \u00a34m. Why did they?</p>",
  "<p>In the past, I've dressed up to go to the theatre and dressed down to go to a club, but I've never paid that much attention about how I look when visiting an exhibition. That will change this week for me and, doubtless, many others, when the V&amp;A launches its big autumn exhibition, Black British Style. Billed as the first of its kind in this country, the show aims to look at the cultural influences behind black style and fashion over the past 50 years. </p> <p>It's a clever idea and sounds like fun. It's not often you find coverage of a museum launch in Heat magazine, but Black British Style will stand a good chance. The show will boast more bling per square inch than any other event in London. Apart from the worthy historical stuff about African influences and postwar immigration, we're promised flashy pop videos, a nail bar, a lesson on how to make headwraps and a chance to ogle some of Goldie's collection of 1,800 pairs of trainers. </p> <p>Jamaican-born designer Jessica Ogden also made the black style connection during her show at London Fashion Week, sending a troupe of black models down a runway inspired by a Kingston Town street party. </p> <p>I smiled when I first read about the V&amp;A exhibition and made a note to go. It's the kind of accessible cultural event that appeals to me, not least because it puts contemporary black life centre stage. But as a celebration of black Britain, it is rather narrow - the identification of black people with style has become a cliche. </p> <p>Like many cliches, it contains some truth; walking through Brixton on a Saturday afternoon is eyecatching, but is it unique? Perhaps there should also be an exhibition about Asian style. Surely the insistence that black people are such style icons is made at the expense of us being valued in other, more surprising, spheres. And what does black British style mean anyway, when you consider how much streetwear is influenced by what American teenagers are wearing, which is made by giant US fashion companies? </p> <p>When well-meaning commentators assess the black contribution to Britain, they frequently highlight the same old things: sport, culture and entertainment. Actually, when I say culture, I mean popular culture: it's our success on the pop charts rather than the Turner Prize (sorry Chris Ofili and Steve McQueen) that seems to stick in the mind. </p> <p>Of course, pop success should be applauded, but it would be nice to celebrate the other achievements as well. When actress Josette Bushell-Mingo launched Push, the black arts festival, earlier this year, which included ballet, theatre and opera, she told The Observer that the event had been inspired 'as my reaction to a situation I find unacceptable. I want to see a more diverse representation of black British artists in England'. </p> <p>Events such as the V&amp;A exhibition provide fuel for old stereotypes. Not that the V&amp;A is to blame for putting on a potentially interesting show, but it reminds us that our views of race and culture have, in some ways, hardly changed in a generation. </p> <p>When I was at school, footballer John Barnes was my British hero, simply because he was black, played for my favourite team and was the best winger in the country. I looked across the Atlantic to black musicians and writers for the rest. The number, although not the variety, of home-grown role models has increased since then. It's not that there isn't a wide range of areas of excellence. Each year, Black History Month organises valuable events to promote awareness but they are unlikely to attract as much attention as Goldie's box-fresh Nikes. In fact, I'm not persuaded that all teenagers need role models, though they may need to see adults they can relate to succeeding in various fields. </p> <p>I visited Harlem for the first time recently and, fortunately, my trip coincided with the annual African-American Day Parade. Getting there was a history lesson in itself; I walked up Malcolm X Boulevard, turning off before reaching Marcus Garvey Park, then joined the parade on Adam Clayton Powell Jr Boulevard. Powell was New York's first black representative in Congress and helped introduce America's first minimum wage during the Sixties. </p> <p>Within the space of a few minutes on a pleasant late summer morning, I had been reminded of black American achievement in politics and civil rights. I struggled to think of a comparable journey in London. The situation is different, and not necessarily better, in America, but I couldn't escape the conclusion that blacks there enjoy a more prominent place in society than they do in Britain. </p> <p>There is no need to look to America for inspiration. We have our own diverse cultural history and a wealth of writers and poets, lawyers and architects, community leaders and politicians to recognise. This might not sound as sexy as going to the V&amp;A to discover why it became so fashionable to wear jeans so low that your Calvin Kleins are on show, but it is probably more important.</p>",
  "The Tories will only win power by showing they have changed and they can do more than talk tough on crime, shadow cabinet minister Andrew Lansley said yesterday. <p>His warning, ahead of tomorrow's party conference in Bournemouth, came as a poll revealed swing voters are more than three times as likely to consider Tony Blair 'in touch' with their fears than leader Michael Howard. </p> <p>In what will be seen as a clear rebuke to those pushing for the party to pander to the right, the Tory health spokesman said voters had 'always imagined' the Tories would tackle hardline issues, but needed reassuring over fears 'they had to trade off with investment in the health service in exchange'. </p> <p>The warning is especially pointed coming from Lansley, who worked closely with William Hague on the 2001 election campaign in which the Tories disastrously dropped messages about public services in favour of shrill pronouncements on Europe, crime and immigration. </p> <p>'What 2001 tells you forcibly is that if you have not defined yourself before the election campaign arrives, you will be defined by your opponents and by the media,' Lansley said. </p> <p>'William had enormous abilities and talents and actually cared deeply about changing the Conservative party and bringing issues like health and education to the forefront, but you can't change the public's perception of you in the last three weeks. We are seeking to achieve that before the election arrives, people understand how the Conservative party has changed.'.' </p> <p>Plans to focus on public service pledges could however be overshadowed by fresh debate over tax, after deregulation spokesman John Redwood called for an \u00a318 billion package of tax cuts, including slash ing the top rate of income tax to 30 per cent. </p> <p>His ideas - which contradict party policy - come in a book written before he rejoined the frontbench, to be published this week. </p> <p>This week Howard's team will each issue detailed timetables for their first days and weeks in office if the Tories win, with Lansley promising to scrap hospital star ratings on his first day in office and crack down on the hospital superbug MRSA. </p> <p>He defended Tory plans to subsidise patients who pay for treatment, arguing it would help prevent 'hundreds of thousands' of previously private patients returning to the NHS - and causing new bottlenecks - as waits for surgery come down. </p> <p>Howard will use his conference speech not only to flesh out his own personal timetable, but to make the moral case for low taxation, although there will be no concrete tax cut pledges. </p> <p>However today's ICM poll for the New Frontiers Foundation think-tank suggests a mountain to climb, with 40 per cent of voters unhappy with Blair but saying they still prefer him to the Tories. </p> <p>Labour is rated more 'in touch with the issues that most concern you' by 49 per cent to 32: Blair is considered more 'competent' than Howard by 50 per cent to 29. Crucially, among potential swingers back to the Tories, 69 per cent consider Blair more in touch and 73 per cent more competent. </p> <p>Dominic Cummings, director of the NFF and former Tory head of strategy, said the Tories needed talented people and a structure 'that is adaptive to an ever-changing and unknowable environment'. It was 'not plausible', he said, for the current party to articulate the messages voters would want to hear. </p> <p>Privately Tories say their internal polling shows Howard level pegging with Blair on key personal attributes demanded of a prime minister, such as experience. But Lansley admitted Howard's time as a Home Secretary under John Major was a 'two-edged sword', since voters had got rid of Major. </p> <p>The shadow health secretary is considered by some on the Tories' moderate wing as a potential leadership contender, if a contest were to be held after the next election. Asked by The Observer if he would stand should Howard fall under the proverbial bus, he declined to rule it out categorically, saying: 'I think it's an idle and vain pursuit to think about anything other than supporting Michael Howard, who I believe will be a fine Prime Minister.'</p>",
  "Tony Blair's boldest claim for Labour has been that the 21st century will be a centre-left 'progressive century', in contrast to the last, now recognised as the 'Conservative century'. During it, indeed, the Tories were in power for 70 years, either on their own or as the dominant partner in a coalition. <p>Their two 'secret weapons' were adaptability, which allowed the party to champion or drop policies at will, and hunger for office, which minimised divisions and allowed it to present a united front to the electorate. </p> <p>Since becoming Labour leader 10 years ago, Blair has stolen these two weapons. New Labour has become the supreme flexi-party, jettisoning policies and interests that played badly with Middle England and insisting on unity at all costs to avoid a return to the dark days of the 1980s. </p> <p>Blair has thus achieved what no Labour leader has managed before: he has parked Labour in the middle ground of British politics, much as Palmerston did in the mid-19th century. The Tories fared badly against both men as a consequence. </p> <p>But are things now different under Michael Howard? Has his presence at the helm since November 2003 heralded a revival in Tory fortunes, or will the continuing presence of Blair prove a fatal barrier to their return to power? </p> <p>This week the Conservative leadership will try desperately in Bournemouth to put a positive gloss on the party's fortunes. Howard knows that this is likely to be his last conference before the general election. He is aware of criticism of his failure to tackle Blair more effectively so far, not least over his difficulties with Iraq and the vote to ban fox-hunting. </p> <p>A cold look at recent history suggests, however, that Howard faces a task of Herculean proportions. The most recent polls show support for the Tories languishing at around 30-35 per cent, down on the level recorded earlier this year, and even lower than last summer's showing under Iain Duncan Smith. </p> <p>Going further back provides no more comfort. Never have such low polling numbers been followed by the Tories' return to power. When Margaret Thatcher was hounding James Callaghan's government, the Conservatives regularly picked up double-digit leads before defeating Labour in the May 1979 election. </p> <p>More tellingly still, between 1975 and 1979 the Tories won a series of by-elections, overturning massive Labour majorities with swings of more than 20 per cent. Since 2001, however, they have been no more convincing at winning by-elections than they have been in the opinion polls. Thursday's Hartlepool result, with the Tories in fourth place behind Ukip, was a shattering blow. Far from reviving, the party's electoral fortunes appear to be stagnating. </p> <p>After previous electoral debacles, the Conservatives bounced speedily back. Four years after its 1906 hammering, the party was level with its opponents: six years after 1945 it was back in power, and it took only four years after the 1966 defeat for the party to be back in office. Yet, more than seven years after 1997, the Tory party seems as far from power as ever. Not for a century and a half, since Palmerston led the Liberals, has the Tory position been so dire. </p> <p>When faced with electoral difficulties during the 'Conservative century', the party resorted to three tried and tested remedies. The most dramatic was to dump the leader. This option, however, is not available, having elected Howard unopposed less than a year ago. </p> <p>The second remedy was to reshape and revitalise the party organisation. Again this is no answer: since 1997 the party has been repeatedly reorganised, to little effect. </p> <p>The third historic antidote to the party's ills has been a rethink of policy. Could this offer Howard the key to Blair's defeat? From the outset Howard resolved to use his authority to rebuild the party's broad appeal. Despite his lingering image as a right-winger, Howard declared that he would 'lead from the centre'. He eschewed raising the Euro-sceptic banner and instead tackled the government over the reform of public services. </p> <p>Howard's initial centrist strategy had much in common with that of his two predecessors. Between 1997 and 1998 William Hague presented his 'caring, compassionate Conservatism', while in his first year Duncan Smith focused on reforming public services. </p> <p>Like Howard, they were following the electoral logic of moving the party to the centre, hoping to capture moderate voters. However, as opinion polls failed to respond, both Hague and Duncan Smith changed course. Not only were they failing to pick up the moderates, they were also losing hardcore supporters who felt alienated. Panic set in and the party lurched rightwards. </p> <p>By mid-1999 Hague began to trumpet a jingoistic Euro-scepticism, while in January 2003 Duncan Smith got tough on immigration, declaring that terrorists posing as asylum seekers presented a 'national emergency'. Some activists cheered. Most voters did not. For both Hague and Duncan Smith, tacking to the right proved no more successful than their initial bid for the centre ground. </p> <p>For Howard, the downside of his 'coronation' as leader was that it raised expectations of an early recovery to an impossibly high level. Following Howard's decision to return the party to centrist politics, the party expected results. Why, critics asked as early as this May, were the Tories not benefiting from Labour's extreme unpopularity? Was the centrist route failing once again? </p> <p>In June, while the Tories performed respectably in the local elections, their showing in the European elections proved hugely disappointing. Traditional Conservative supporters deserted the party, voting instead for Ukip. There followed a difficult summer for Howard as he failed to skewer Blair with the Butler report and the party fared disastrously in by-elections. </p> <p>In an attempt to regain the initiative, Howard launched a attack on political correctness in August, before spelling out an uncompromising approach to immigration in September. The recent reshuffle saw modernisers demoted, while John Redwood, the saviour of the right, returned to the shadow cabinet. </p> <p>Despite all this, Howard's aides say he will hold to a centre course this week in Bournemouth, facing down pressure for him to follow Hague and Duncan Smith in their right-wing acrobatics. But it seems the wrong signal has already been sent. </p> <p>The idea that the party's future lies in a return to the right owes more to fantasy than reality. There are clear parallels with the Bennites who plagued Labour for years. They claimed repeatedly that, if only Labour offered a purer form of socialism, voters would reward them at the polls. Neil Kinnock, Blair and their fellow modernisers thought otherwise and moved Labour solidly into the centre ground. </p> <p>Therein lies Howard's problem. Whatever policy platform and face he presents at Bournemouth and beyond will make little or no difference to what happens in the opinion polls or in the coming general election. </p> <p>The painful truth for the Tories to swallow is that, as long as Blair remains in office, backed by the Murdoch press and with the economy doing well and interest rates low, and as long as he is able to keep Labour in the centre, Howard's room for manoeuvre will be severely constrained. </p> <p>Blair has now pledged to serve until the end of a third term. If he can endure that long - and it is a big if - the Tories' woes will continue. </p> <p>The Tories' best hope of ending the 'progressive century' before it gets into its stride is for the New Labour project to implode. But only continued problems in Iraq, an upsurge in international terrorism or an economic debacle of ERM proportions can unseat Blair. Events in Iraq will be more important to the Conservatives than anything that might happen in Bournemouth. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Anthony Seldon is headmaster of Brighton College, a biographer and an historian.

  "Somewhere in the bleary early hours of last Friday morning, a bunch of jubilant strangers gatecrashed the victory party of Labour's newest MP. <p>The activists from the anti-European UK Independence Party (Ukip) might ordinarily have expected to be barred from the Hartlepool HQ of Ian Wright. But not, it seems, on a by-election night in which they forced the Conservatives into a humiliating fourth place. 'As we'd beaten the Tories, we were welcome,' recalls Clive Page, their Hartlepool spokesman. </p> <p>This weekend, as he prepares for his first party conference as Conservative leader, Michael Howard faces a peculiarly unholy alliance against him. </p> <p>From the right, Ukip is marching on Tory heartlands with its promises of withdrawal from the EU; to the left, the Lib Dems are scooping up the disaffected Labour protest votes that Howard needs. Squeezed in the middle are the Tories, trying to decide where to open fire first. </p> <p><b>The plan for power</b><br> </p> <p>This week, Howard's team will unveil plans for their first day, first week and first month in government, a bold move to make them look poised triumphantly on the brink of power. Just days after what shadow defence secretary Nicholas Soames succinctly described as a 'fucking awful' result in Hartlepool, they might struggle to look convincing. </p> <p>Yet the irony is that Howard, who was elected unopposed as a unity candidate more than 11 months ago, following the vicious disposal of Iain Duncan Smith, has done most of what his party asked. He has restored the Tories' credibility at Westminster, boosted dwindling membership, opened party donors' chequebooks and quelled the eternal plotting that destroyed his predecessors. </p> <p>The only thing he has not done is actually win over voters. Trust in Tony Blair has collapsed, but that is prompting a backlash against all mainstream politicians, not enthusiasm for Howard. One year later, recent polls reveal that nearly one Tory in five would rather see Blair in Downing Street than his own party: Blair scores higher than Howard on both competence and being 'in touch' - and highest of all among potential Tory swing voters. </p> <p>Stephan Shakespeare of YouGov, the party's former pollsters, says they are no longer flatlining in the polls: it's worse than that. 'You would normally be expecting a rising curve going into the next election to get in reach of the target,' he says. 'The fact it has stayed where it is means they are, in reality, going backwards.' </p> <p><b>Party troubles</b><br> </p> <p>No wonder the mood, as the party faithful gather in Bournemouth, is queasy, not least among Tory MPs with knife-edge majorities. 'There will be fluttering in the dovecotes over this,' says one veteran frontbencher, ominously. 'Conference is going to be difficult.' </p> <p>Howard will try to calm his restive party - as Blair did his last week - by lowering the temperature. He will not, frontbenchers insist, be panicked into offering specific tax cuts, although Oliver Letwin, the shadow Chancellor, will send broad signals. </p> <p>And there will be no overblown rhetoric, no 'big ideas': just small, practical policies, with a promise that ministers who fail to deliver them will be fired. The Tories hope this will reassure a new breed of floating voter, convinced grandiose political promises cannot be trusted. </p> <p>'How many big ideas have we had from Blair? \"A thousand days for a thousand years\"; \"the young country\"; \"the giving age\"; \"healing the scars of Africa\",' says David Cameron, formerly Howard's special adviser and now his shadow cabinet policy co-ordinator. 'People are fed up with politicians grandstanding.' </p> <p>The task instead, as chairman Liam Fox will tell the conference tomorrow, is for the Tories to prove that 'political parties are not all the same'. </p> <p>The risk, however, is that such low-key language will be drowned out in a cacophony of conflicting advice from the sidelines, with right-wingers demanding more Euro-scepticism to prevent Ukip defectors. Can Howard stick to his course? </p> <p><b>Whiff of panic</b><br> </p> <p>The word that Howard's political admirers use most often of him is 'decisive'. 'He is very focused on what he wants to achieve; he doesn't brook diversions,' says Andrew Lansley, his shadow health secretary. Cameron argues Howard is more sure of himself now than he ever was as Home Secretary: 'He seems more calm, more measured.' </p> <p>In Central Office, however, there is a whiff of panic. The first sign came with an interview published in the anti-war New Statesman last Thursday - the day Hartlepool went to the polls - in which Howard directly accused Blair of lying over Iraq, a charge even Charles Kennedy has avoided. </p> <p>Howard voted for the war, and still supports it: like John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate whose 'flip flopping' on Iraq has damaged him, was he now jumping belatedly on the anti-war bandwagon? Opponents scented blood. </p> <p>'It's a desperate attempt to seize ground that we're occupying,' says an indignant Tim Razzall, the Lib Dem campaign manager. Downing Street, too, is preparing to exploit Howard's inconsistencies on Iraq, believing the public will resent any breaking of ranks when British troops are still under fire. </p> <p>There may trouble, too, on his own side. Duncan Smith - who received intelligence briefings in the run-up to the invasion and believes Blair acted correctly - is understood to be seeking pledges in Howard's speech this week that the Tories will not dilute support for the war. </p> <p><b>The Ukip threat</b><br> </p> <p>The second warning sign came on the eve of polling, when the party took out a full-page advert in Hartlepool's evening paper declaring its opposition to the euro, the European Constitution and a federal superstate - all of which was calculated to appeal to Ukip defectors. </p> <p>'I thought that was desperate,' says Page, who says this was the point at which he realised his party could beat the Tories. Ukip rubbed salt in the wounds at its own annual conference in Bristol, with a 'victory' dinner for 200 of the faithful last night. </p> <p>However Howard's aides insist there will be no lurch to the right on Europe this week and that there is no evidence such a move would attract the floating vote Howard needs - and Kennedy is already getting. A poll for last week's Economist found that, while 25 per cent of voters would be more likely to vote Tory if Howard pledged to pull out of Europe, a third said it would make no difference as they 'would not vote Tory anyway'. </p> <p><b>Keep buggering on</b><br> </p> <p>Andrew Mackay knows a bit about Ukip supporters: the deputy party chairman's own son, Hamish, voted for them in the European elections, 'because he wanted to give us a bloody nose'. Hamish will be voting for his father at the next general election, and Mackay - who is in charge of target seats - believes most of those 'protest-voting' Ukip will follow: 'I think Ukip's bubble will burst.' </p> <p>His optimism is backed by polling carried out in 130 of the Labour-held seats he oversees. It found the Tories have reversed Labour's lead in the battleground for the next election. </p> <p>'They're full of traditional Tory voters who were rather taken with Blair and voted for him in 1997, and now they feel let down,' he said. Crucially, Labour won many of these seats thanks only to tactical voting by Lib Dem voters, who may not help out again. For months, Mackay has been pushing Howard's claim that Blair lied over Iraq. </p> <p>Could these tentative green shoots of Tory revival be real? Even if not, there is no appetite among demoralised MPs for another leadership coup with a general election so close: they accept not much can be done beyond - as Soames himself put it - 'KBO' [Keep Buggering On]. </p> <p>Even the voters seem confused about what they would prefer: the top choice in the Economist's poll of potential leaders was not any of five senior Tories, but 'someone younger' - a sign that they believe the Tories' Blair, someone who can rescue the party, has not yet emerged. </p> <p>However, a bad result could prompt a leadership contest, probably between David Davis and Liam Fox on the right and Letwin, Lansley or Damian Green, the recently deposed shadow education secretary, on the moderate wing. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, due to return to Parliament at the next election, is also a contender. Gentle manoeuvring may begin this week. </p> <p><b>It's the voters, stupid</b><br> </p> <p>Shakespeare has a warning for the Conservatives - the experience of three leaders in as many years should teach them that its problem is policies, not people: 'Leaders have far less of an effect than we normally give credit for.' </p> <p>Dominic Cummings, former head of strategy at Central Office, agrees there is 'no magic bullet', beyond a radical intellectual refreshment of the party. Lack of trust in Blair, he argues, is not enough to guarantee victory: 'Trust in Clinton plummeted after the Lewinsky scandal but his job approval ratings did not.' </p> <p>Lansley accepts that the Tories' first task is getting voters to trust politicians again, but argues a centralising platform of free-market economics, social tolerance and a gentle scepticism about the EU could prove a vote-winner: </p> <p>'The 20, 30, 40-somethings who are at the heart of those the Conservative Party has to win over - that's the way they approach life now.' </p> <p>What they are not doing, yet, is approaching the Conservative Party. </p> <p><b>Two sides of Michael Howard:</b></p> <p><b>Soft cop:</b> </p> <p>'We are all crew on what at its best is the most superb campaigning vessel politics has ever known.' <b>Howard on being made leader of the Conservative Party, November 2003 </b> </p> <p>'It was a bold and brave experiment but it didn't work, it was a mistake, I've apologised for it before and I'm happy to do so again.' <b>On the poll tax, December 2003</b> </p> <p>'One of the worst ways in which people are denied control over their own lives.

  "<b>It's just not cricket</b> <p>A fascinating portrait of our convalescing leader emerges in the strangest of places, a new biography of cricket writer EW Swanton by David Rayvern. 'Pompous Jim', as Swanton was known, was put forward for a gong in 1995 as part of John Major's drive to reward as many of his boyhood heroes as possible but, alas, ended up with only a CBE. In 1998, in an attempt to glean whether the new PM might look upon him more favourably, a friend of Swanton wrote to a teacher who had known Blair at Fettes eager to learn if the young Blair had displayed any cricketing prowess and might thus treat him kindly. It transpired that the man who intends to lead Labour for a full, historic third term 'had been a promising cricketer in the junior colts' but that, later on, 'cricket was not regarded as a fitting pastime by the Blair mafia'. The teacher recalled ACL Blair as 'bumptious but amusing', and that his main claim to fame was acting. 'He is a skilful showman, loves the limelight and is a shrewd stage manager,' was the concluding observation. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Mayor Ken was in confessional mode at the Labour conference. Speaking at a fringe meeting to showcase the London Olympic bid, Livingstone admitted he was only a recent convert to the Games. 'Anybody looking at my body would see I am no athlete. Before Athens, I had never been to an Olympic Games in my life. I was usually on a beach somewhere far away consuming vast amounts of alcohol.' </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Perhaps it's the soaring price of Brent Crude caused by the unrelenting crisis in the Middle East: hacks wanting to fly with George Dubya for his final weeks on the campaign trail have been told they will have to pay $18,000 each for the privilege. Those wanting leather business class seats, as opposed to lumpen coach class seats, pay extra. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams greatly enjoyed his diocese's recent theatrical production of The Mystery Plays. Those expecting something am-dram were surprised to see former Equaliser star Edward Woodward drafted to play the role of God. An incongruous choice some might think, but the diocese's newspaper, Outlook, reports Woodward's God was 'domineering' and resplendent in 'robes that seemed to be modelled on George Carey's enthronement vestments'. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> In these troubles troubled times, Pendennis give thanks that there is one man who keeps his head when all around are losing theirs. Chris Leslie, the junior minister and MP for Shipley, is clearly not someone prone to panicking when things go pear-shaped. As pro-hunt protesters were bundled out of the conference after heckling the PM last week, they lobbed a rape alarm into the crowd which landed by the ice-cool Leslie. Unsure what the strange device was and, worried it might be a bomb, our hero chose to cover it with a copy of the Guardian.

  "<p><strong>The Life of Graham Greene - Volume 3: 1955-1991</strong><br>by Norman Sherry<br>Jonathan Cape \u00a325, pp906</p> <p>When Graham Greene died in 1991, at 86, his reputation as a great 'Catholic' writer was assured. His books reflected an awareness of sin and confronted discomfiting themes with a sombre eye. Brighton Rock imagined a betrayal of loyalties in gangland Britain. After 66 years, it remains a disturbing parable of conscience. In his three subsequent theological works - The Power and the Glory, The Heart of the Matter and The End of the Affair - Greene's gift was to locate the moment of crisis when a character loses faith, religious or otherwise, and life is exposed in all its drab wonder.</p> <p>With Greene's centenary upon us, what else can be said of this great writer? First, his fallible, deeply ambivalent characters are unlike any in British fiction. Pinkie, the child hoodlum of Brighton Rock, murders without a qualm, yet, as a Catholic, he fears damnation, and Greene was able to establish our empathy for him. Over the 60 years of his writing career, he created a gallery of other shabby creatures who try to hide their weaknesses from the world and themselves. In Catholic terms, he was a moralist troubled by human turpitude and evil in our time.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the unsparing bleakness of Greene's vision has influenced a number of contemporary writers, among them John le Carr\u00e9 and the Irish novelists Brian Moore and Ronan Bennett. However, Greene remains inimitable; when Philip Larkin tried to parody the author of The Heart of the Matter in a weekly magazine, the result was memorably awful: 'Hatred moved in him like fatigue as, unsurprised, he recognised betrayal.' With more than 30 novels to his name, Greene was our most singular and prolific chronicler of damaged faith and human wretchedness.</p> <p>A writer of this stature would need a very good biographer and, at first, it looked as though Greene had found him in Norman Sherry, a Joseph Conrad expert based in Texas. A quarter of a century has passed since Greene appointed Sherry his official biographer in 1976. Flattered, Sherry set to work immediately, digging and hustling for information like a locker-room snoop. His first 800-page volume emerged in 1989. While Sherry had much to say about Greene's fiction and inner life, he examined his every depression, love affair and alcoholic spree in excessive detail. 'Oh why does Sherry waste so much time talking about me?' Greene grumbled. During his researches, Sherry had gone temporarily blind in Africa and endured gangrene in Panama. 'I do hope I am not going to be the death of him,' Greene said darkly.</p> <p>Secretly, perhaps, Greene delighted in Sherry's tribulations and spaniel-like devotion to the task. He may even have enjoyed the vinous associations of his biographer's surname. ('Let's go to Sherry's,' says Pinkie of a Brighton drinking club, quickly adding: 'I can't stand the place.') During the 28 years of his sleuthing, Sherry appeared to identify strongly with his subject, and this has been his undoing. The third and final volume of his biography, covering the years 1955-1991, sees Sherry visiting Greene's haunts in Cuba, Haiti, the Congo and, finally, the Swiss hospital where the writer died. Unfortunately, the volume contains many more flights of vulgar hagiography and plain bad writing than either of the two previous volumes.</p> <p>The author's descriptions of Greene are Boy's Own in tone and suggest an adolescent crush. 'I see his eyes so clearly,' Sherry writes, 'with their light fiery blue of a Siberian husky's.' (Elsewhere, Greene's eyes are merely 'sea blue'.)</p> <p>In the final chapter, when Greene is dead, Sherry indulges in some truly awful writing. 'Worms breed, and the handsome man with stunning blue eyes is host to a thousand sliding lascivious creatures, eating our flesh, turning us gradually into a sort of human jam.' Just why this passage - and many others like it - was allowed to stay in is a mystery. Didn't Sherry have a proper editor?</p> <p>The biography is also repetitive and ludicrously self-aggrandising (at one point, Sherry compares his work to Schubert's Unfinished Symphony). It is also critically dim, with endless summaries of Greene's novels that recall Brodie's Notes for students. ('There are four major characters in the novel,' Sherry says in schoolma'mish fashion of The Honorary Consul.)</p> <p>Occasionally, too, the author is vindictive. He unkindly upbraids Greene's French lover of 30 years, Yvonne Cloetta, for believing that Greene ever truly loved her. Cloetta had 'insufficient nous', Sherry gripes, adding: 'Lying to oneself is not unknown.' Cloetta died in 2001, so she cannot respond; it may be a mercy that she did not see this galumphing, ill-disciplined tome.</p> <p>Sherry is crass about Greene's love affairs, and has an old-fashioned view of women that some will find insulting. 'Unlike the weaker gender [physically, at least], Greene had a great advantage: he was a man, and a big one.' Is that it? But there is worse. Greene's philandering was apparently 'slowly devouring him - tortuously slow like a boa eating a goat'. This sort of exaggeration is especially ill-suited to Greene, whose books are so concisely written.</p> <p>At times, it seems that Sherry may have learnt psychology from Oprah Winfrey. ('Love is never stationary,' he informs us. 'It is in flux, as the movement of the tides.') And only Sherry, one feels, could compare the Papa Doc of Greene's hot-house entertainment, The Comedians, to Emily Bront\u00eb's Heathcliffe. ('What bastards fill the world,' he interjects typically.)</p> <p>Thankfully, Sherry has a good chapter on Greene's troubled sense of religion, and argues convincingly that he retained his faith, if not his belief, in Catholicism all his life. During 1938, Greene's religion was bolstered decisively in revolutionary Mexico, where he found evidence of murdered priests and burned churches. The fear-ridden priest of the The Power and the Glory, the novel that resulted from Greene's five weeks in Mexico, has become part of human experience.</p> <p>To his dying day, according to Sherry, Greene kept a photograph in his wallet of the Italian stigmatic Padre Pio who displayed the wounds of Christ on his hands and feet. Whether these lesions were of neurotic origin - psychological rather than supernatural - Greene did not care to know: he wanted there to be a mystery at the heart of life.</p> <p>Few novelists have fathomed with such intensity the suffering and dark places of this earth. Sadly, though, the man Evelyn Waugh nicknamed 'Grisjambon Vert' (French for 'grey ham green') has been singularly ill-served by this book. Sherry's three-volume Life of Graham Greene, running to a combined total of almost 2,500 pages, stands as a warning to biographers: keep a proper distance from your subject. And for Norman Sherry to have begun so promisingly and ended so badly is a personal tragedy.</p>",

  "<p>The house my parents built for their retirement is now my sister's. The last time I visited, in the spring, I went running on the Pennine Way, missed a signpost and ended up in a cul-de-sac near an isolated barn conversion, a mile from the village. Three Dobermanns emerged, more bark than bite but intimidating none the less. Their owner wouldn't call them off until he'd berated me for invading his privacy and seen me off back up the single-track road. A car came slowly down the hill and I waved at the driver to ask directions, but she wouldn't stop. </p> <p>Later, lost again, I was chased down by a young farmer on a quad bike and ordered off his land. Inhabitants of the Yorkshire Dales have always been fierce about protecting their property, but this was different. This was new money and a terror of strangers. This was the death of the spirit I associate with my father - leaving the back door open, being 'pleasant' to people and helping when someone's in trouble. His corner of England was parochial, and he, lording over it, a bully. But generosity and trust were there, too. I can hear his growling appraisal of the new age - bloody car alarms going off, kids cooped up indoors, postal deliveries gone to pot and a bunch of smarmy buggers ruling the country. </p> <p>It was in 1991 that he began to die. He'd led an active, sometimes hyperactive life as a GP and there were no signs, other than tiredness, of failing health. But in October, he made an appointment at the hospital. In November, an inoperable cancer was found. And by mid-December he was dead. He was 75, an unsurprising age for a man of his generation to die. But nothing had prepared me. To lose a parent had been my biggest childhood dread, and though 40 years old, with a wife, a job, and children of my own, in terms of emotional maturity I was still a child. </p> <p>From time to time (particularly times of upset), I've kept a diary and in the three weeks between diagnosis and death - as I shuttled by train between London and Yorkshire, or lay unsleeping in the spare bedroom of my parents' home - keeping a diary kept me going. But after the funeral, and the cold hearth of Christmas, I sank into depression. The only solace came from memories of childhood featuring my father in disgusting good health. I began typing them into my Amstrad, as though to resurrect him. </p> <p>I didn't tell anyone what I was up to. It was done blind, from a black hole, as catharsis, without an eye for publication. But at some point, I must have let on to Bill Buford, then editor of Granta , who bullied me to show him something, liked what he read, printed an extract, convinced me there was a book here and offered to publish it. The draft typescript began with my dying father in hospital, then flashed back 30 years to him queue-jumping on the way to a car race at Oulton Park. Bill liked the alternating time frame but suggested I switch things round - first the past (so readers got to know my father at his most domineering and alive), then the present (so they could share my sense of loss). </p> <p>On 8 December, 51 weeks after my father's death, the book was finished. My working title was A Completely Different Story, a phrase my father had used when informing his GP of his cancer. Among the alternatives was And When Did You Last See Your Father?, from the Victorian painting by WF Yeames, which shows a son on the verge of - in Roy Strong's words - 'inadvertently betray[ing] his father through his own truthfulness'. Bill persuaded me that was more apposite. He said he'd be printing 3,000 hardbacks. It seemed a forbiddingly large amount. </p> <p>A worldly friend told me to relax, that reviewers were bound to go easy on the book because of the subject matter, a son grieving for his father. He was right. They did. Even more surprising, the book found readers. Translations appeared as far away as Japan and Syria and there was talk of a film for BBC2. For a poet, this was big stuff. I'd got lucky, though, as ever, the credit was due to my dad. In life, I'd been in his debt and here he was again, helping me out from beyond the grave with royalties, options, serialisations, foreign rights. Even in death, I owed him. </p> <p>That's the story I've been telling for the past decade. But now that I've forced myself to look at the diary entries, I find the story isn't quite accurate. The diary, for instance, isn't a diary as such. In those days, all my work-in-progress, 90 per cent of it poetry, was done in notebooks (stitched, unlined, with hard blue covers - I bought a dozen of them in Skipton in the 1980s and now I wish I'd bought more). </p> <p>My habit was to write poems in the front of the notebook and (flipping it over) journal entries at the back. But the notebook recording my father's death is different. After some desultory shots at fiction (a thinly disguised version of my then miserable life, set against the backdrop of the 1990 Gulf war) and several unfinished poems (about crane flies, sunflowers, moving house and the impossibility of writing poetry), the rest of the notebook is taken up with descriptions of my father's illness. </p> <p>Though chronological, few are dated and they're not at the back of the notebook but up front; heading them all is the story of my father queue-jumping at Oulton Park, which I thought I'd written in mourning, but which I must have set down while he was alive. Perhaps, with a splinter of ice in the heart, I saw this stuff as 'material' all along. Certainly, towards the end, I set myself an agenda: 'To write about dying and not be deadly. To write about sickness and not be sick. To write about my sick and dying father and not be merely \"sensitive\".' </p> <p>The mantra of every creative writing programme is: revise, revise and revise. The alarming thing about the notebook is that the words I set down when insomniac, surprised by grief and lacking judg ment, are much the same as those in the final draft. This is true even of the first entry, originally set down as a poem: </p> <p>On a day trip to see me down in London, </p> <p>You left your orange drophead Fiat in the place </p> <p>Where they unload the postbags on Leeds station, </p> <p>Illegally, you knew, but you were rushing, </p> <p>Just how illegally you saw on your return </p> <p>By a posse of mail vans enclosing it </p> <p>In a tight, red, get-out-of-this-one circle. </p> <p>Improvising quickly, you asked at Inquiries </p> <p>'Has anyone seen my orange Fiat? </p> <p>My son was supposed to leave it in the car park. </p> <p>But I've looked and I can't find it anywhere.' </p> <p>Oh Christ, you agreed, when the angry guards </p> <p>Escorted you to it, What a daft sod. </p> <p>What a prize fathead I have for a son, </p> <p>Until they laughed, and slapped you on the back, </p> <p>And cursed at bloody students, and let you go. </p> <p>You rang that evening, with this story, </p> <p>Who'll now never pick up the phone again. </p> <p>This wasn't poetry, I later realised, but chopped-up prose. It is as prose - fleshed out - that it appears on page 52 of the book, without that portentous last line. Prose seemed to suit my father: his life was too cluttered, and he too larger-than-life, to be contained within verse-forms. It also seemed to suit me: my poetic person had been covert, but the role of family amanuensis, transcribing stories already burnished from repeated telling ('Do you remember the time when ... ?'), seemed to release something. </p> <p>I knew the book couldn't be fiction. Whatever small virtues it might have would come from readers believing it to be true - the story of an ordinaryish family, told by a reliable narrator. The risk was how the real-life characters in it would react to being (the word favoured by accusers) 'exposed'. My father wasn't around to care. But others were, including the three women who'd been most important to him: my mother, my sister, Gill, and 'Auntie Beaty', with whom he had an intense, decade-long relationship, the true (sexual) nature of which was never admitted - not by him, nor by her, nor by my mother. </p> <p>Around the time of publication, terrible things happened to all three. First, my sister's eyesight, already poor, suffered a catastrophic deterioration overnight (she woke with a black land-mass the shape of Australia obscuring all but the edges of her vision). Then Beaty's infant grandson was found to have cancer and seemed likely to die - she used to phone me late at night, asking me to join her in saying prayers. And one night my mother fell asleep in front of the television, awoke confused, stood up too quickly and toppled into the hearth, breaking her arm; the humerus had to be pinned in several places and left her in a lot of pain. </p> <p>'It's as if once my father died,' I told a friend, at lunch, 'all the women he loved were struck down, as if they couldn't prosper without him.' </p> <p>'That's not what you're saying, is it?' </p> <p>'How do you mean?' </p> <p>'You're afraid your book's done this, aren't you?' </p> <p>He was right. I felt guilty. I'd written a book about my father falling apart, and now those closest to him were falling apart, myself (suddenly paranoid) included. The book was praised for its honesty. But did honesty exact too steep a price? I'd a memory of a book in The Name of the Rose that poisons whoever touches it. And of Leonard Bast being killed by books in Howards End. </p> <p>By the time of the paperback, the sense of crisis had passed. Beaty's grandson was cured. Gill's eyesight stabilised, enough for her to borrow large-print books from the library. And the pins were removed from my mother's arm. 'So stupid of me,' she said. 'If I'd stayed in bed reading your book rather than watching television, I'd never have broken it in the first place.' So it wasn't the book that had done the damage. As she saw it, the book might have saved her. I reproached myself for superstition and narcissism, but I never quite got over the guilt. </p> <p>What did my mother think of the book? There are two stories I tell myself. The upbeat version is that she was fine with it and that I'd not have gone ahead if she hadn't been. Most widows would hate having to relive their husband's last weeks. But she was a doctor and knew about death, and understood my motive for describing it in intimate detail. When I sent her the typescript, she suggested only minor amendments. </p> <p>There were sections she couldn't see the point of, especially those relating to Beaty, but she recognised the portrait of my father: 'I can't add to it,' she wrote to me. 'It was him.' I have her letter beside me now. 'I hope you will not be too upset by my nit-picking,' it begins. Most of the nit-picking reflects a worry about what neighbours will think: a passage about me masturbating will 'shock the village', and she dislikes the 'modern writing - piss &amp; shit &amp; fuck and screw'. But all she asked was that I change a name or detail or two, nothing more drastic. </p> <p>On the other hand - this is the bleaker, self-accusing version - in the weeks before the book came out, she felt depressed enough to talk to my sister of 'topping herself'. She also fretted that 'Sandra', her longtime housekeeper, would be so upset by my revelations that she'd quit; the book includes an account of the sex we began having when I was 14 and Sandra, no less of an innocent, four years older. These fears weren't realised. Sandra's only complaint was that I'd bothered to give her a pseudonym. She'd rather have been herself, she said. Nor did my mother, who outlived my father by six years, come close to suicide. Even so, I tell myself, she obviously disliked the book. Why else would she have buried it in her wardrobe, instead of displaying it in the living room with my other books? </p> <p>There's no great mystery about these conflicting versions. My mother, always a chameleon, felt ambivalent. She told some people one thing and other people another; felt one thing one day, something else the next. She'd probably have preferred the book not to exist; in allowing it to, she may well have been indulging her only son. But she was pleased when friends told her they liked it, advised those who found it fruity to treat it as fiction, and never so far as I know used the word 'betrayal'. Her chief feeling towards me wasn't anger but pity, pity that I lacked her own equanimity in relation to Beaty. 'It's over 20 years ago now and I have forgotten it,' she said. 'I wish you could too.' </p> <p>And Beaty? By 1991, her affair with my father was long over and she'd moved to another part of the country, and I chickened out of telling her of the book's existence. She found out soon enough, because of a salacious article in the local paper, sent to her by a friend. She called me in a panic, assuming I must have used her real name. I posted her a copy by return, to show that I hadn't and that other giveaway details (including her hair colour) had also been changed - those who already knew about the relationship would realise 'Beaty' was her, but those who didn't wouldn't. She called me again after she'd read the book to say she was returning it. It never arrived. </p> <p>I know she was angry with me for quoting a letter she'd written to me after my father's death. But the point of quoting was to show how it had finally dispelled the mystery darkening my childhood. I'd never known whether they were lovers or not, but now accepted this was none of my business. In time, she forgave me and went on to write more letters. I still have them. I have photos of her, too, dating back to the 1960s. It was easy to see why my father fell for her. She died a couple of years ago. We were closer at the end than ever before. </p> <p>She also drew closer to my mother, phoning her twice a week and coming to visit. Once their love for the same man had been a source of pain and friction; now it united them. 'Oh, why don't you move next door,' my mother would say to her, 'then we can talk all the time.' On one occasion, Beaty asked: 'Have I been the cause of your depressions?' to which my mother replied: 'Don't be silly, love, I've had them for as long as I can remember.' Beaty needed to hear that. She still felt guilty and worried that people 'hated' her. Her final verdict on my book was 'well written but God how sad - and you are so, oh so wrong about thinking you have a [you know what] ... ' </p> <p>What she couldn't bring herself to say was that her daughter 'Josephine' might be my half-sister. The physical resemblance was striking and so was my father's attentiveness, but Beaty strenuously denied it. Later, only last year in fact, Josephine called me herself. She'd just got round to reading the book and had seen through the disguise. I was afraid she'd be angry and affronted. Not at all, she said. Since childhood, she'd had similar suspicions about her paternity. She reminded me that my mother had delivered her, which is quite a thought: a woman delivering the child of her husband's mistress, while knowing or suspecting it's his. Josephine has the same bright voice as Beaty. We keep in touch now, like family. </p> <p>Once the book was published, letters began to arrive. There were letters from family and letters from writers I knew, but, above all, there were letters from strangers. Most were from people who'd lost someone close to them, invariably a father, often a father resembling mine. They'd read my story of bereavement and wanted to reciprocate with theirs. I got to know a lot of fathers - from much-loved octogenarians who'd been swimming across the bay only a month before their demise to dimly recalled 30-year-olds killed in car crashes. And I discovered how many of my father's idiosyncrasies - jumping queues, tinkering with cars, asking 'How much for cash?'- weren't idiosyncrasies at all. Many readers took up the challenge of the book's title and told me when they'd last seen their fathers. One or two from Yorkshire also told me when they'd last seen mine. </p> <p>The Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool sells postcard reproductions of the Yeames painting; I bought a large supply and tried to answer each letter that came. Most correspondents were apologetic - for writing to an author at all (was it allowed?), for the presumption of using my first name, for being 'death bores'. They just wanted me to know the book had been therapeutic - 'which, at \u00a314.99, is cheap at the price,' one wrote, while another talked of feeling 'plagiarised - these are my thoughts, from the darkest corners of my life'. I felt like an agony aunt when I'd once dreamed of being TS Eliot, but enjoyed the novelty of being useful. When visiting patients, my father used to carry a bag - a panic bag, he called it -full of pills and panaceas. Now I was a healer, just like him. </p> <p>There was a downside. People seemed to think they knew all about me, just because they'd read my book, whereas I was aware of things I hadn't told (and still can't tell) for fear of hurting those I love. For the sake of balance, when so much about the father was being exposed, I'd made a deal to embarrass myself, but not to drag every skeleton from the closet. When audiences at book festivals greeted me like an old friend, I felt a fraud. 'And how's your mother doing?' they'd ask. 'And your sister? And Nikki the dog?' I couldn't complain that this was intrusive. It was me who'd thrown the door open. But the answers to those three questions - burning on a pyre of grief; blind; dying - weren't easily sayable. The book was there for perusal. But the story outside it - the life still being lived - wasn't public property. </p> <p>Most of the fallout from And When ... was genial. Even the postcard from the author whose biography I harshly reviewed ('Obviously losing your father has made you bitter and twisted') seemed forgivable. The book became my equivalent of friendsreunited.com. My first girlfriend wrote from Australia, the one who'd broken my heart at 16 by emigrating. And other friendships were resumed. People who had never invited me to their parties invited me to their parties. Institutions which had never sought my opinion sought my opinion. I didn't forget that the allure was really my dad's. Putting him in a book, when he didn't read books, had been my revenge on him. But his revenge on me was sweeter. I'd taken up writing to escape his influence. But the only half-decent thing I'd ever written was a book about him. </p> <p>By the mid-1990s, critics were identifying a new wave of narrative non-fiction, of which works as diverse as Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch and Jung Chang's Wild Swans were said to be part. A researcher phoned from a television arts programme and asked would I talk about this. He'd an idea the genre went back to Truman Capote's In Cold Blood . Maybe you're right, I said, but I've never read In Cold Blood . Not to worry, he said, we'd still like to interview you. </p> <p>A camera crew spent the afternoon setting up in a spare office at the newspaper where I worked on City Road. I talked for 20 minutes, then they asked me about In Cold Blood . I haven't read it, I said. But you'd agree it was probably the starting point, they said. Yes, In Cold Blood could well have been the starting point, I said, but ... perfect, they said, and began packing up their gear. The piece went out that night. My contribution was a single sentence: ' In Cold Blood could well have been the starting point.' </p> <p>Capote wasn't the only gap in my knowledge. I'd written a father-son book without having read Gosse, Turgenev, Ackerley or Geoffrey Woolf, and without seeing John Mortimer's A Voyage Round My Father . Ignorance is sometimes enabling. My awareness of several unsurpassable poetic elegies for fathers - by Tony Harrison and Michael Hofmann, for instance - was part of my reason for not attempting poetry. </p> <p>What I had attempted was hard to say: not autobiography (I wasn't the subject), not memoir (traditionally written by someone grand and old), and certainly not confession. The term Life Writing wasn't in use then and, anyway, Death Writing was nearer the mark. The one influence I could think of was Roth's Patrimony , a very different book to mine (American, by a major author and about an already much fictionalised father), but which I read the year my father died. </p> <p>'When a writer is born into a family,' Roth once said, 'that family is dead.' It's true. But so is the opposite. When a writer is born into a family, that family has an afterlife. In And When_ I'd invited people who never knew my father to get to know him. 'I suppose you'll be doing your mother next,' people joked and eventually, in Things My Mother Never Told Me , nine years after the first book, I did. A full-length book about each of your parents: how weird is that? But wouldn't doing the one and not the other be even weirder? (So you don't love your mother enough to write about her?) </p> <p>More and more of my generation are performing acts of filial homage - among them Martin Amis, Hanif Kureishi, Andrew Motion, Graham Swift and Alan Jenkins. Perhaps a midlife need for reparation underlies it. When young, we were impatient with our parents; now we want to atone for our callowness, to take measure of them, to understand which parts of them live on in us. </p> <p>Writing a book about my father hasn't stopped me thinking about him. I live among his stuff still - the stethoscope he waved at policemen when he was speeding, the pacemaker removed from his chest before cremation, the desk, the blazer, the RAF squadron tankard. There are always further surprises. I'd no idea, for instance, until Beaty told me in a letter, that he'd a thing about not revealing his age (a trait I've inherited). </p> <p>And I've only just turned up the letter he wrote his MP in August 1967, demanding to know how copies of Soviet Weekly had found their way into the local youth club. His voice is silent but I hear his tone. His body's missing but I recognise him in my children. It's only when I go home and see the changes in the village that I know he's dead. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This piece appears in the current issue of Granta magazine 'Jubilee', available in bookshops for \u00a39.99 or direct from Granta.

  "<p>Flash back some 10 years. An icy recreation ground in Ipswich and an under-12 football tournament. The man who is to present the trophies, the former Ipswich, Tottenham and Manchester United striker Alan Brazil, hurries across the freezing turf, just in time to perform his duties. His straggly, thinning hair flaps in the wind, as does his worn, long white coat. His jeans are frayed and somewhat too tight. He looks, frankly, a bit of a wreck. He certainly does not look like 'Pel\u00e9', the nickname afforded him by team-mates - courtesy of his surname, he has insisted modestly, not his ability to score goals. Few of the children know who he is, or was. He is not exactly given a rapturous reception by their parents, either. Brazil has something of a reputation around Ipswich, the town he came to at the age of 15 after the club he supported, Celtic, rejected him. After retiring through injury at 27, he ran a well known local pub, The Black Adder. But things did not work out. Eventually Brazil was declared bankrupt. He hands out the plastic trophies and the medals in quick time, muttering 'all right, son' to the recipients. Then he turns and is off back across the recreation ground... </p> <p>Now flash forward to the present. The well appointed London offices of TalkSport radio near Blackfriars Bridge. Brazil is doing his job as weekday presenter from 6am to 10am. He is TalkSport's most popular and best paid presenter, reportedly pulling in more than \u00a3200,000 a year. Then there is his weekly slot as a football pundit on Anglia TV and his work for the American cable giant ESPN. Today, after the show, he has a meeting in the City. Tomorrow, he will drive to Newmarket to see his string of thoroughbred racehorses, kept there under the aegis of the Alan Brazil Racing Club, a 200-strong syndicate. Their colours are green-and-white hoops. It was in Newmarket a couple of years ago that I first got wind that something was up with the Alan Brazil story. I spotted him in the bar of the exclusive Bedford Lodge hotel. Mobile in one hand, chilled glass of lager in the other, with the BMW parked outside, he was every considerable inch the man about town. There was no doubt about it. Brazil had come back with a vengeance. But how? </p> <p>I asked Brazil's TalkSport colleague Alvin Martin, the former West Ham captain who is himself attempting to climb the lower slopes of punditry, to name me a top six of ex-footballer pundits. Setting aside Gary Lineker, whose role is rather different, he said: 'Andy Gray at Sky is top of the list. He's got everything. Second you'd have to put Hansen. Alan has been doing it a long time. Then you'd have Mark Lawrenson, Andy Townsend - he's really broken through - Ally McCoist and, if you're talking radio, you'd have to have Alan Brazil in there. He's the sort who doesn't wear you down. He doesn't become tiresome. That's always the danger. What you've always got to imagine is that you're in a pub.' Martin spoke these words in deadly earnest. He could have been discussing the top six Premiership teams. If you thought the world of punditry would be an extension of dressing-room camaraderie and japes, as it sometimes appears, you would be very wrong. Indeed, with the notable exception of Kelvin McKenzie, who runs TalkSport, not one of the pundits or producers I spoke to approached the subject with anything but great solemnity. Pundits, like players, had to be nurtured, cajoled, moulded, cut free from the strings of dressing-room loyalty until the moment when they can fly free and Hansen-like into the living-room ether. </p> <p>As Brian Barwick, controller of ITV Sport and the man who signed Hansen to the BBC, told me: 'With a pundit you are looking 10 years down the line. There is a honeymoon period when viewers recognise them from their playing days. But that ends. Then you're going to be marked purely on your performance as an analyst.' </p> <p>It is a long way from 1970, when John Bromley, who produced that year's World Cup for ITV, put together the first 'panel', comprising Malcolm Allison, Paddy Crerand, Derek Dougan, Brian Clough and Bob McNab. Each was paid \u00a3500 for the month. They were not sent to Mexico, but put up in Hendon Hall hotel and ferried to and from a studio. After a week a worried minion alerted Bromley to the size of Allison's bill. It included champagne, Cuban cigars and expensive wine. Bromley was unworried. Such had been the instant popularity of the panel that he knew his invention would repay his investment one hundredfold. He signed the bill and ordered that, for the duration of the World Cup, each member of the panel be woken with a glass of vintage champagne. </p> <p>Such carefree times are long gone. Punditry is now a fiercely competitive business. For the producers, the pundits have become prime assets. They are also aware that current star footballers earn far more than their predecessors and have no need to court a media career. For the pundits, there is the knowledge that dozens of ex-pros are queueing up to take their seats on the sofas if they slip up and that each year there will be dozens more. Not all big-name players are successes, the most notorious example being Paul Gascoigne's induction as a pundit for ITV at the 2002 World Cup. After his bleary, bewildered and nervous performances, Gascoigne has not been sighted on the sofa since. By his own admission, he ran up a \u00a39,000 drinks bill in his room in the course of three weeks, though he insisted both Townsend and McCoist had contributed to it. This time, however, there was no John Bromley to sign it off. And then there was Barry Venison, jocked off at ITV by Townsend amid unconfirmed rumours that Gabby Logan found his astonishing transformation from bouffant Newcastle lothario to bespectacled camp icon creepy. Those in the box seats watch each others' moves as closely as if they were still jostling in the penalty area. Martin is not surprised. 'That's life,' he said. 'When we were playing it was the same, so why wouldn't it be now?' </p> <p>Today there is a pandemonium around Alan Brazil's studio. Two big stories have broken at once - the start of the school siege in Beslan and the arrest of three jockeys in an alleged race-fixing scandal. Everyone knows one of the arrested is the champion jockey, Kieren Fallon, but no news organisation has named him yet. Kelvin McKenzie, spry and scrubbed in a dark suit, emerges from the lift to take personal control. Unaware of the ghastly turn the siege would take, he repeats to no one in particular: 'Which is the bigger story?' He answers the question himself: 'Fallon is bigger.' During an advert break he enters the studio and gives instructions. There follows a debate on the likelihood of race-fixing, conducted by Brazil and his sparring partner, Graham 'Beeky' Beecroft, a journalist-turned-broadcaster. The house lawyer is in constant contact with the studio. 'Just don't let anyone mention Fallon!' Brazil gets as far as 'Kier...' and a listener mentions the initials 'KF'. There is a seven-second delay and these are zapped before they can go out. Quite a lot of zapping goes on. The producer explains that while ex-footballers can be trained in broadcasting basics, legal considerations tend to escape them. The two most troublesome recent zaps were when Brazil passed judgment on an ongoing murder trial and when a hotelier, invited on to explain his decision to ban gay ramblers, said: 'I won't have buggery in my bedrooms.' </p> <p>Brazil's broadcasting style is calm and laconic, overlaid with a sporadic bullying streak towards the polite Beecroft. It used to be Mike 'Porky' Parry, another veteran journalist, sharing the mike with him, but Parry is awaiting a heart transplant and Beecroft has stepped in. It is good knockabout stuff, underpinned by necessary news values and bearing the unmistakable stamp of McKenzie, who seems to have found a m\u00e9tier again after a rather desultory time at Sky. Really it is the Sun meets BBC Five Live, but far more entertaining than either and very clever. Ratings have risen quarter on quarter, with one arbiter,GFK, putting TalkSport first among Britain's commercial stations, with a reach of 5.4 million adults. Rajar, the traditional ratings judge, has it a close third behind Classic FM and Virgin. As with the Sun , the characters of contributors are relentlessly lampooned. Brazil - famously bucolic, though he denies it - has not escaped. The TalkSport trailer for Euro 2004 announced: 'Alan Brazil is finally coming out of the pub.' </p> <p>Brazil's tenure has not all been easy. At last year's Cheltenham Festival, which he was fronting in situ, Brazil was sacked by McKenzie for failing to turn up for a show. An insider told me Alan had been on a bender and could not be contacted. Brazil had received written warnings for such absences before and McKenzie's patience had run out. However, such was the listener reaction that McKenzie had to reinstate Brazil, who, in turn, released a contrite statement saying: 'There were times after a big \"do\" when, yes, I wasn't in the right shape to go on air.' </p> <p>The show over, Brazil and Beecroft re-emerge among the production desks manned by eager young staff. Brazil's use of the adjectival f-word is so impressive that it seems incredible that he was able to suppress it on air. There, he had been a stalwart of racing's integrity, refusing to believe the charges against the jockeys could be true. Now, he is considering conspiracies. He suspects, for example, that a horse had been 'pulled' the previous week due to collusion between two jockeys, though he admits he has no evidence. He slumps down next to me on a sofa. His mobile rings. It is Geoff Huffer, his racehorse trainer. Huffer has listened to the show and thinks the charges against the jockeys are trumped up - Fallon has by now been publicly named. When Brazil gives Huffer his new conspiracy theory, Huffer rejects that too. Brazil says he's probably right. He turns the mobile off. He is in no real mood to talk. He left Ipswich at 4am to get to the studio. He was in bed last night at 8pm. </p> <p>He muses about his playing career. Twelve goals in 25 appearances for Manchester United (a fact mentioned frequently) but never guaranteed a starting place. Some statistician has said that he got 89 goals in 220 pro appearances. 'Complete bollocks,' Brazil says. 'I got more than that. At United it was down to Big Ron. It's true I wasn't the same player there. I never recaptured my Ipswich form. And Big Ron had Hughes and Whiteside as well. It wasn't that he blanked you, but you just knew you weren't part of the gang.' </p> <p>We agree to talk in Newmarket in a few days. The whole production staff are relieved that Brazil has got through the Fallon inquisition. The appointment of Huffer as trainer for the Alan Brazil Racing Club has attracted attention in the racing press. Huffer has just returned to training after a break of several years, including some jail time for duty fraud. He is in partnership with the disgraced financier Terry Ramsden, who saw his racing and boxing interests collapse in the late 1980s and was later convicted of fraud. 'Colourful' is the word most used to describe the set-up Brazil fronts. The next day he is again absent from the show, but this time he has a legitimate reason. His father is ill. In a typically McKenzian move, Beecroft is scripted to announce: 'We want to stress that Alan has not been arrested in connection with the inquiry into possible race-fixing.' </p> <p>Exit Pele, enter the 'Italian Stallion' as Tony Cascarino was known at Millwall. A childhood friend of Townsend, Cascarino is an up-and-comer in the pundit world. His sensational swansong with Marseille, where he was France's leading scorer and called 'Tony Goal', went largely unnoticed at home, where he was remembered for flopping at Celtic and Chelsea. That changed with the publication of his unexpected bestseller, Full Time, in which he brilliantly and with brutal honesty narrates his career, prodigious sex life and chronic self-doubt. The book led to a Times column and TV and radio work, including an afternoon show on TalkSport. A tall, imposing man, it is hard to believe that he began his adult life as a trainee women's hairdresser, or that he was known within the game for the amount of time he spent tinting his hair. An attempt to rib him gently about his complete lack of qualifications to play for the Republic of Ireland, which he admits in the book, does not go down well. Instead, Cascarino makes it clear that certain frivolous attitudes towards punditry, and indeed certain pundits, irritate him. 'A manager in the Premiership was talking to me recently,' he says. 'And he said, \"If I lose my job I think I'll do what you do\". That's the attitude. They think it's easy. It's not. </p> <p>'It's not true that all ex-footballers could do it. I've been in dressing rooms with players who had no knowledge of football. Unbelievable. No knowledge of the game they're in!' It is the same, he believers, with some pundits. 'Venison is terrible. Garth Crooks is awful. Awful.' He shakes his head. 'What does Crooks bring to that show [ Grandstand ]? He doesn't bring anything!' </p> <p>It was Cascarino, one suspects, who was instrumental in bringing Townsend to the station, not that he needs the work. After six months Cascarino has still not fully mastered the control panel. Townsend worked it all out on his first day. 'Andy always gets ahead of me,' sighs Cascarino. 'Whatever I do.' </p> <p>I am summoned to McKenzie's office. He sits wearing an impish grin. I ask him what the words 'Alan Brazil' bring to mind. 'A pint of Guinness,' he replies archly, before adding: 'By that I mean a very smooth form of delivery. He's done fantastically. You've got to remember this is a man who fought his way back from bankruptcy.' But you sacked him, I point out. 'He had a temporary, erm, departure. He had had a stressful Cheltenham working enormously long hours. He was leant on by hundreds of fans to drink more than he should have. It is difficult to have a radio show with no one behind the mike.' </p> <p>He does not stint on the phrase 'bloody dick'. I ask him if there are players he would not consider using as pundits. 'That bloody dick Kieron Dyer for a start,' he says, without expansion. 'And I'll tell you who really was a revolting specimen and that was Stan Collymore. He didn't even turn up. So we didn't last long with Mr Collymore. Look, it's quite simple. Our guys choose themselves. Then you put them on air with a journalist type. In sports radio two-handers work better.' </p> <p>His personal influence, he claims, is much exaggerated. 'Listen, if I had a radio station that appealed to me, all I'd be saying all day would be: bring back hanging and shoot all asylum seekers.' </p> <p>It is, however, between the two terrestrial giants that the main pundit war is fought out. Match of the Day editor Philip Burney is chiefly concerned with bringing Gordon Strachan to the frontline. 'Alan Hansen has perfected a kind of brand,' he tells me with the gravity to which one has become accustomed. 'Now Gordon needs a good run. He needs perhaps to become more relaxed, but he works very hard. We are very keen on Gordon and we've done a lot of work with him.' </p> <p>I ask Burney if he has noticed how Strachan tends to loop an arm round the back of the sofa, sometimes creating the optical illusion that he is stroking Mark Lawrenson's neck. He does not see the light side. 'No, no,' he says. 'That's good. It shows he's relaxed.' </p> <p>But over at ITV, Barwick believes that in Townsend he has a weapon that even Hansen might not withstand. Certainly, the days of ITV's ill-fated 'Tactics Truck', in which Townsend unpromisingly began by trying to run through key moments with players barely out of the showers, are now forgotten. It has been a long-term plan. 'People forget that before we saddled him with the \"Tactics Truck\", Andy was being used locally in Birmingham. We put him on there and got some hours on the clock. I always told him, you've got to tell the viewers m something they haven't spotted. He is now an outstanding analyst. He is an almost perfect example. Andy can really undress a game.' </p> <p>The Gazza debacle would not happen again, Barwick avers gravely. It is his greatest regret in pundit-management: 'We had him in a pundit's chair for the opening game of a World Cup when he'd never done it before. We gave him a mountain to climb. When he was allowed to regale viewers with his old stories he was fine. But with the hard analysis, it came too quickly. We went on a whim and dropped him straight in it.' </p> <p>There are signs, perhaps misleading, that Townsend has become aware of his new value. He ignored perhaps a dozen requests for an interview, including a plea via his old mucker Cascarino. In the end, I ambushed him after his TalkSport Sunday morning show. Dressed casually in a tracksuit, he exudes less presence than one might imagine from TV. He speaks more slowly and diffidently than his on-air machine-gun delivery. He appears quite shy. It becomes clear, however, that he is indeed the embodiment of the new-pundit work ethic. Pundits who fall by the wayside probably have only themselves to blame. 'Their biggest mistake is they tend to look on punditry as a bob on the side,' he says. 'I've seen how certain people regard TV work. I've worked hard. Even with the Tactics Truck, which never really worked. But I personally will always have a go.' </p> <p>He talks pleasantly if platitudinously about how he enjoys it, how he speaks for the fans and how Teddy Sheringham (another old mucker) will make a good pundit. When he looks at his watch I ask about his alleged complicity in the Gazza \u00a39,000 bender and he bridles. 'I know about that,' he says quickly. 'We were having a drink but I can assure you we weren't putting them on his bill. Gazza's a friend. It was an awkward time in his life. Booze was his only get-out and unfortunately it came during the World Cup. He needed people around and we did get through a few bottles of wine. But he's fit now. He's off the booze. If he wants it there's still time for Gazza to come back on TV.' </p> <p>It is crunch time. Arsenal against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League, live on ITV. Townsend is perched, rather uncomfortably it looks on the screen, in the open air, holding a microphone. He is wearing the unorthodox combination of a brick-red jacket, a black leather-style tie and a black shirt. As well as his punditry, he now has the role of 'colour commentator' beside Clive Tyldesley during matches. Apart from Big Ron no other pundit, not even Hansen, has bridged this mythical broadcasting gulf on a regular basis. I watch and listen for evidence that Townsend has indeed perfected his art, that, as Barwick said, he will undress the game in a way I could not previously imagine while at the same time meeting the Alvin Martin principle that he can be imagined talking to me down the pub. I catch: 'I think he's got good cause to be disappointed about that one.' Then: 'Gilberto initially done well there.' But to mock is too easy. Townsend is without doubt very good at what he does. </p> <p>So is Brazil, but when he agreed to meet in Newmarket I was envisaging dew on the gallops and steam rising from horses' backs. Instead, when Brazil picks me up from the station along with his daughter, Stephanie, he drives to a pub. It is 9.30am. To be fair, it is the full breakfast he is after, though he does add: 'We'll have a few pints later, eh?' He muses about his bankruptcy. 'The brewery turned nasty.' He had to sell up and move to a smaller house. 'But I told my daughter, \"We won't be here long\". How long were we there darlin'?' </p> <p>'Six years,' Stephanie says. </p> <p>This was not perhaps the answer Brazil was expecting, but he overrides it and instead, between chews, informs me: 'I'm very confident, you know.' I say I don't doubt it, but it does occur that there may be little to be gleaned about the punditry business from watching Brazil eat his breakfast. So I decline his offer of a few later pints and, before heading back to the station, leave him with the question: where would he be if none of this had happened? If he hadn't made those first mad visits to GMTV that started it all, 150-mile round trips from Ipswich for two minutes on a settee, virtually unpaid? If he hadn't hustled Radio Suffolk, then Sky for Nationwide games and finally climbed the punditry mountain that had defeated even Gazza? </p> <p>His fork poised with bacon and baked beans, Brazil considers the question with utmost seriousness. He fixes me with a meaningful stare and, perhaps forgetting his current surroundings, replies: 'To be honest, I'd still be in a pub.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Rendall is the author of Twelve Grand: the Gambler as Hero (Yellow Jersey Press) and This Bloody Mary (Faber)</p>",
  "<p>I left home in Australia at 16 to have trials with Manchester United. It was a toss-up between them and Liverpool. Ironically, in retrospect, I chose United because I liked Alex Ferguson more than Kenny Dalglish, the then Liverpool manager. To get round the work-permit problem, I enrolled as a student at Manchester Poly, though I don't think I ever saw the inside of a lecture hall. Eventually, the immigration people caught up with me and I had to leave. That really hurt. There are two things you can't help in this world - who your family are and where you're born. Why was I being punished for this, while other guys who were no better than me took my place? I then had to do my military service in Yugoslavia, where I had a lucky escape. Two years later and I would have been caught up in the whole civil war. </p> <p>Fortunately, I was able to come back and play for Aston Villa [after marrying an Englishwoman]. I loved my time there. A lot of people don't realise how good a side we were back then, with players such as Ray Houghton, Dean Saunders and Andy Townsend. In Paul McGrath we had the best centre-half I've ever played behind, with the possible exception of Jaap Stam. In 1994, we won the League Cup, beating Manchester United, after I had saved four straight penalties in a semi-final shoot-out against Tranmere. Two years later, we beat Leeds in the final. I would look at McGrath - how perfect he was on the pitch and how imperfect he was off it - and promise myself that I would learn from his mistakes. </p> <p>Re-signing for United in 1999 was a chance to resurrect a dream that had been snatched away from me. Although our relationship started badly when I turned up overweight for pre-season training, I generally got on fine with Fergie, even if he did harbour some resentment that when I came back to England I had signed for Villa. He thought he'd got an agreement with my dad that I would return to Old Trafford. Later, he signed Fabien Barthez to replace me and look how that relationship ended, so maybe the egg is on his face. </p> <p>The real problem was with Steve McClaren and Tony Coton, the goalkeeping coach. I had developed my own training techniques. These didn't fit in with their ideas and that made them very insecure. I certainly never trusted McClaren and his role in United's success has been completely overplayed. That said, my first season with the club was fantastic. We won the World Club Championship and took the Premiership title by a record margin. But I kept getting injured and events off the pitch didn't help. </p> <p>That story about Fergie bailing me out of jail is bullshit. But it's true that I was arrested after going for a photographer outside a strip bar. The first thing people want to know about that is what was I doing coming out of a strip bar at 4am on the day I was due to get married again? The answer is that I was a coward. I realised that I shouldn't be marrying my fianc\u00e9e and because I was frightened I went out and did something stupid in the hope that she would call things off. She didn't and we broke up 12 months later. </p> <p>The move to Chelsea should have been the perfect fresh start. But I didn't get on with the manager, Claudio Ranieri. They say that the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist and I think Ranieri pulled the same stunt last season with the press and the fans. With the resources he had at his disposal, there's no doubt that Chelsea should have won something. At the end of the day, what's he ever won? A poncy Spanish Cup, that's all. </p> <p>I still maintain that at the time of my drugs test in November 2002 I was not taking cocaine. That came after. I had a big argument with my then girlfriend [supermodel] Sophie Anderton and decided to go to a nightclub. I got talking to a girl who later admitted that she had slipped the drug into her drink. I must have had a sip of her glass. I'm deadly serious about this. After all, I've got nothing to lose now. I've been banned, come clean about all the drugs I was doing and I probably won't play football again. Why should I lie? </p> <p>I despised Chelsea for the way they behaved. The idea that Sophie had a history of drug abuse and that she must have encouraged me couldn't be further from the truth. </p> <p>They had already tried to sell me on but I told them that I wanted to fight for my place in the team. They would then send me off to train with the kids, or to help out with the reserves. It was humiliating. When news of the drugs test came out, they used every weapon to force me out. </p> <p>My parents gave me an ultimatum to choose between them and Sophie. I chose her and they haven't spoken to me since. Eventually, we separated. Like a lot of celebrities, I went to the Priory but I wouldn't say that did me any good. I went there more on the advice of my lawyers. It has been only in the past few weeks that I've managed to get clean. In fact, according to my diary, it's been six weeks. </p> <p>I don't miss football. In fact, the only games I've watched since the ban were England's during Euro 2004. At first, I thought I was reacting against the way I had been treated. Now I realise I just don't need it. I appreciate what the game has done for me: I wouldn't be able to sit in a nice hotel here in Knightsbridge giving this interview if it hadn't been for football. But I owe it nothing and it owes me nothing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Bosnich will be featuring in The Match, broadcast on Sky One, across the whole of this week.</p> <p><strong>The life facts</strong></p> <p>Mark Bosnich was born in Fairfield, Australia, in 1972. After a brief spell as a teenager with Manchester United, he signed in 1992 for Aston Villa, with whom he won two League Cups. In 1999, he returned to Manchester United, where he won the 1999-2000 Premiership. In 2001, he was sold to Chelsea. However, in November 2002, he failed a drugs test and was subsequently banned for nine months. He has not played since.</p>",

There are daily visits to natural hot pools, springs and steam baths and, come the evening, the guesthouse owner will tell you the best spots for aurora-watching. You finish the trip with three nights based in a Reykjavik guesthouse.

  "<p>More than 400,000 British children could potentially fall foul of new US immigration rules, the Foreign Office warned this week.</p> <p>In addition to a new compulsory fingerprinting programme for all Britons entering America, which began this week, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) insists that, from October 26, all children entering the US must have their own machine-readable passports. The Foreign Office says more than 400,000 chil dren are still registered on their parents' passports. With half-term for most schools starting on October 25, and America still Britain's most popular holiday destination, the Foreign Office says it is \"concerned\" about the change. A spokes-man said: \"We're not sure how many parents know about this new rule. And they need to.\"</p> <p>Also causing concern, with Bonfire Night round the corner, is a new hyper-sensitive explosives detection device introduced at America's biggest airports this week.</p> <p>Pat Hynes, federal security director at Ronald Reagan Airport in Washington DC, said the machine would pick up gunpowder particles from ordinary fireworks - even if handled only briefly several weeks earlier.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the new fingerprinting process seems to be running smoothly, but there are worries that it will come under strain during peak travel periods like Christmas or the summer holidays.

The Village d'Enfants caters for three to eight year olds. Petit Poucet kindergarten collects and delivers children aged three and over from your chalet or hotel. ESF, Snow Fun, Oxyg\u00e8ne and Evolution 2 all cater for beginners from three or four years old. Billabong snowboard school is for riders aged seven and over.

The skiing is laid out on three interlinked mountains served by 22 lifts. Of these, the huge Outback area is the size of both other mountains combined and is protected from the wind. The resort also has one of the biggest and best-designed terrain parks in North America. Keystone's main claim to fame is that it has North America's largest night-skiing area - so energetic teens and preteens can carry on skiing after dark. Childcare for little ones is good, as it always is in North America, with the nursery at Keystone Children's Center caring for babies from two months, and the Snowplay Programs are for children from three years old. </p> <p><strong> How much?</strong> \u00a3885 per adult, \u00a3770 per child self-catering in a two-bed apartment in West Keystone condos.

The prize-winning hotel has been owned by the Pizzinini family since 1940 and has one of the best restaurants in the area, called St Hubertus. The restaurant has enjoyed a Michelin star since 2000 and chef Norbert Niederkofler creates local dishes with a gourmet twist.

The Eagle's Eye restaurant is at the top of the gondola. Here the best of Alpine dining is mixed with Canadian service and style in a surrounding of wooden beams, floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the Purcell, Selkirk mountain ranges and a roaring log fire.

Just above it is the equally popular Krazy Kanguruh. Most guests, after dancing in their ski boots and consuming copious amounts of alcohol, still manage to negotiate on skis the final 800m home in the dark. Down in the resort the action continues until sundown at the Underground, as well as at the Postkeller or the Platz'l, which have live music.

The journey involves a 50-minute flight from Denver to the town of Montrose and a further 75 minutes by road. When you finally get here, nothing prepares you for the time-warp effect, a step back to a true mining town of pastel-painted clapboard buildings and the occasional fine brick edifice that has managed to maintain its Victorian heritage. In a country that has been disfigured by neon signs, Telluride's streets are lit by dim sodium lamps true to their period, while cars (the speed limit is 15mph) traditionally give way to pedestrians. </p> <p><strong> How much?</strong> \u00a3999pp at the five-star Wyndham Peaks Resort on the mountain overlooking the town.

By refusing to invest in new lifts, Red Mountain has so far kept the pioneering spirit intact, and the terrain has done the rest.

  "<p>When Philip Brocklehurst went to Antarctica, he brought back his own toes as a souvenir. In a jar. Of course, that was in the early days of Antarctic tourism (1908, in fact, as part of Ernest Shackleton's unsuccessful attempt on the Pole). Were he to have made the trip with us, in 2004, onboard MS Explorer II, he'd probably just have left the toes on whatever rock they'd frozen to, and picked up a proper souvenir - such as a Swarovski crystal frog - from one of the ship's two onboard souvenir shops. (That's if he could tear himself away from the ship's beauty salon for 20 minutes.)</p> <p>These days, a voyage to the world's wildest frontier does not mean hardship or danger or just-going-outside-and-maybe-being-some-time heroism. It does not even mean missing elevenses. It means a cruise ship and comfort and luxury and unlimited free cocktails and Harry Potter films showing in a little cinema and a well-stocked library and deep leather armchairs and a gym and a turndown service and two dining rooms and five courses for dinner every night and kir royale sorbet between courses and, almost certainly, a full complement of toes on your return. And yet the Antarctic you experience is no less magnificent than Brocklehurst's.</p> <p>And it's not all plain sailing. The Explorer departs from Ushuaia, at the foot of South America, and must first cross the Drake Passage: 650 miles of open ocean between Cape Horn and the nearest bit of Antarctic - and one of the world's roughest seas (as the straps across the ship's beds attest). The crossing takes about 50 hours - that's roughly eight sickbags, for the one in five who suffer - though we are fortunate to have the smoothest crossing of the season (waves \"just\" 15ft at their peak).</p> <p>It should be hellish, this two-day-and-two-night confinement onboard, but the cruising lifestyle is beguiling. The food and facilities onboard are equivalent to an old-fashioned, slightly unimaginative four-star hotel, but no one gets bored. There is a whole facultyful of academics and experts onboard to teach us about Antarctica - from ornithologists to meteorologists to former Royal Marine polar navigators - and their lounge lectures are also relayed to all cabins on closed-circuit TV, which allows you to doze through the bits about igneous rock formations with impunity. Nearing the pole, of course, there are no time zones, and the ship soon develops its own: breakfast, bouillon, lunch, nap, dinner, piano bar, bed.</p> <p>And then you see your first iceberg and everything changes. The size, you are ready for (\"as big as cathedrals\", said Darwin). The shapes too: amazing - though no different from the ones you've seen in photos. But the colours. The colours are like nothing you've ever seen, not even in pictures of icebergs, for no camera can capture them. Blue, blue-green, blue-blue-green, turquoise, aquamarine, green-blue, electric-blue, neon-blue, moon-blue, ice-blue, blue with a hint of blue ... you could fill a dozen pages of Roget and not quite define iceberg blue. It's perhaps because there are so many different shades, sometimes even within one berg. From ethereal, elusive, pellucid is-it-even-there? subtlety to the bright, clear, garish can-it really-be-natural? colour of the gelatinous stripe in a minty toothpaste. Translucent with a dusting of snow on top, they look as inviting as Turkish delight; recently calved (broken off) and they are jagged and darkly ominous, calling Winslet and DiCaprio to mind. We all pay extra attention at the iceberg lecture, and are peeved to learn that if we are sunk it will probably be by a smaller piece of ice known as a \"growler\" or even (the indignity!) a \"bergy bit\".</p> <p>Our trip lasts 10 days in all, and at no point does anyone get blas\u00e9 about ice. Which is just as well, since 98% of the continent is covered in it. Our first sighting of the other 2% comes at Neko Harbour, and it is overwhelming, everything you could ask of Antarctica: ice, snow, mountains, penguins, whales and a bitter cold. In a pattern that will be repeated twice a day for our five days on the Antarctic peninsula, the Explorer's 200-odd passengers go ashore in two separate \"sittings\", ferried from ship to shore in a fleet of 12-man Zodiacs (motorised dinghies, but more robust).</p> <p>With an hour or so at our disposal, half the group follow one of our guides on a hike; others get no further than the first delightful penguin colony; still others are satisfied just to sit and let their eyes drink in this otherworldly place. In Antarctica, you can stand and turn 360 degrees - taking in godlike mountains, shoreless seas, whole oceans of ice and endless horizons of snow - and see not one thing that suggests you're still on Earth. On our hike (\"trudge\" would be a better word, seeing as each step leaves you thigh-high in snow), every footfall felt like this world's first. I kept thinking of the beginning of Planet Of The Apes, when astronauts arriving on an unknown planet cross a nameless sea and tread untrodden soil: we too seemed to crunch snow that had never been crunched before, and like Charlton Heston, climbed the top of a hill to see what was on the other side - and saw nothing but more of the same, stretching to a distant horizon.</p> <p>When you do see some sign of Man (like the grim hulk of a floating whale blubber factory on Enterprise Island), it feels like that same film's famous final reel. Our guides constantly reminded us of the fragility of the world's last wilderness - and of the fragility of the international agreements that protect it. Currently, all territorial claims (there are many) are suspended indefinitely, but with rich mineral resources beneath the ice - and mining technology improving - there are ominous (if comical) signs of renewed national claims: Argentina, Chile and the UK all say this Antarctic peninsula is theirs, and in 1997 the Argentinians \"strengthened\" their claim by flying a pregnant woman here to give birth. Chile trumped that in 1998, bringing a couple of newlyweds to conceive in Antarctica. And Britain? Britain opened a sub-post office.</p> <p>The British base at Port Lockroy was built as part of a secret second world war mission, code-named Operation Tabarin, to keep tabs on enemy shipping round the Horn. Abandoned in 1962, it was renovated and opened to the public as a post office, research station and museum in 1996. There are several such relics dotted around the Antarctic, putting valuable flesh on the bones of the history lectures onboard the Explorer: it is one thing to try and imagine overwintering in a place where temperatures reach -60C; it is another to see the tiny stoves that were supposed to keep you warm, and the little World Service wireless that was supposed to keep you sane. Lockroy is particularly surreal because in among the 1940s editions of Dickens is the latest Bill Bryson. Men still live here.</p> <p> E ven more bizarre, though, is Vernadsky, a Ukrainian research station bought from the British (for \u00a31) in 1996. Alongside the abrupt military notices in Cyrillic script there is a signed photo of Wincy Willis on one of the walls.</p> <p>It was at Vernadsky that the hole in Earth's ozone layer was first discovered, while at Lockroy, our \"boffins\" are engaged in rather less illustrious research: they are eight years into a survey of whether human contact affects penguins.</p> <p>\"Does it?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"No, not really . . .\"</p> <p>\"Thought not,\" I say as a penguin potters happily between my legs.</p> <p>\"It's because they haven't got any land predators. They bloody hate it when we lower the Union Jack, mind.\"</p> <p>\"Patriotic penguins?\"</p> <p>\"No. When it flaps around at head height, they think it's a bird attacking them.\"</p> <p>It's just as well penguins don't mind people; the Explorer would probably sink under the weight of unrequited adoration otherwise. As with icebergs, still pictures don't do justice to these unfeasible birds: they're less photo genic than video genic. Until you've seen them waddle, wings outstretched, like nuns in a hurry - or peer quizzically at you with one schoolmasterly eye after another, or pinch each other's nest pebbles when they think no one's looking - you don't know cute. Even seals must defer to them in the sweet stakes.</p> <p>Whales, too, are unabashed showmen, the humpbacks ostentatiously raising their tail flukes high like a regal wave before diving. We see dozens - humpbacks, minkes, sperm and right whales - but each time is breathlessly exciting. Their grace in the water, sheer size and terrifying proximity (especially when we're in the Zodiacs) do not tire, and there are more moist eyes than the biting wind alone can account for when our marine biologist tells us we have seen our last.</p> <p>Turning north and heading home again, we have one last adventure: a colossal ice field. What has brought these uncountable thousands of icebergs into one place we don't know, but as the captain steers us skilfully through this forest of solid water, it's like discerning shapes in clouds. Everyone sees something different in the bergs' randomly-carved forms: castles, cathedrals, skulls, naked women, desserts, airports, a graveyard and Shane McGowan's mouth are all spotted.</p> <p>Perhaps there's something of a Rorschach test about it, and it reminds me of the place we saw on our very first day in Antarctica. Paradise Bay was a brutally beautiful place whose name seemed ironic - until our Zodiac driver turned off the engine and utter silence descended, even over the gregarious Americans who made up 90% of our party. There is a thin line in Antarctica between a cruel, deadly wilderness and a sublime, uplifting one. Which side of that line you stand on probably depends on whether you're: a) staying until the relief ship arrives in the spring; or, b) on your way back to MS Explorer II for the purser's signature hot-chocolate-with-rum-in-it. I was both grateful and profoundly sad to be in the latter group.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Noble Caledonia (020-7752 0000, <a href=\"http://www.noble-caledonia.co.uk\">noble-caledonia.co.uk</a>) offers 13-night Explorer Cruises holidays from \u00a33,195pp in December, including scheduled flights, two nights' pre-cruise and one night's post-cruise hotel accommodation in Buenos Aires, half-day sightseeing tour in Buenos Aires, and a 10-night Antarctica cruise with all food and drink aboard ship.

  "It was billed as \"a gladiatorial encounter unique in world politics\". Actually, given its rigid format, there were times when the televised debate between John Kerry and George Bush reminded me of a politicised version of Just A Minute. You felt if Nicholas Parsons, rather than Jim Lehrer, had been in charge Bush would have got hammered for repetition, deviation and hesitation: often in a single sentence. <p>If anything, it was the epic length of the encounter that turned it into some kind of heavyweight contest for a prize purse. </p> <p>On the left, we had the patrician figure of \"Gentleman\" John Kerry: a veteran fighter known for his upright stance but thought to be defensively shaky and incapable of landing a knockout punch. </p> <p>On the right, we had George (\"King Con\") Bush, famed for his deft footwork, over-zealous seconds and legendary capacity to nobble the referee and turn a defeat into a technical victory. In the event it was Kerry who emphatically won, outpointing Bush, by my calculation, in 12 of the 15 rounds. </p> <p>By the end of a punishing, if riveting, fight both looked decidedly groggy. Kerry, by a slip of the tongue, gave the impression he was for, rather than against, nuclear proliferation. And by the final round Bush was so glassy-eyed that, given the chance by Lehrer to defend the charge that he was a liar, he went into auto-pilot attack on Kerry's alleged flip-floppery. </p> <p>Throughout, in fact, Bush's swallowed vowels and slurred speech suggested a faintly punch-drunk old champ; and when he talked of the \"moolahs\" in Iran one wondered whether he was confusing them with the expected moolah to be gained from Iraq. </p> <p>But it was an evening when the contender, rather than the title-holder, had everything to prove; and Kerry, to my surprise, turned out to be nimble in defence and quick in attack. </p> <p>He came out with the best, if clearly well-rehearsed, line of the night when he said that attacking Iraq after 9/11 was \"like Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor\". </p> <p>And, when asked what colossal misjudgments Bush had made, he jokingly asked \"Where do you want me to begin?\" With his imposing mass of hair and seamed, Henry Fonda-like features, he even managed to look like a president in waiting. </p> <p>Bush, in contrast, relied heavily on that folksy, down-home manner and sub-John Wayne drawl that has kept him ahead in the polls. But when he claimed \"I don't need anybody to tell me to go to the UN\" you suspect there was a hollow laugh in Downing Street. </p> <p>And too often he seemed both over-rehearsed and badly briefed: he kept repeating his pre-programmed mantras about Kerry's inconsistency, yet often looked as if he was floundering in his 30-second responses. </p> <p>One thing was certainly clear: Alex Jennings's portrayal of him in David Hare's Stuff Happens as a shrewd politician and wise fool now looks unduly flattering. </p> <p>But what do I know? I cringed when Bush, in response to a question about the American soldiers killed in Iraq, talked of his tearful prayers with a bereft war widow; yet a Republican spin doctor described this as an incredible \"risk\" that would play well with the electorate. </p> <p>Equally significant was the moment when Lehrer accidentally referred to 10,052 American lives lost in Iraq before hastily correcting it to 1,052. Had he been speaking of Iraqi lives lost, the former figure might have been more nearly correct. </p> <p>And, to watch the news after the \"gladiatorial\" contest and to see images of a reported 35 children caught in the latest Baghdad crossfire, was to move from the shadow-boxing of a rigidly structured debate into the world of deadly reality.</p>",
  "<p>The career of the photographer Richard Avedon, who has died aged 81, was called by Susan Sontag \"one of the exemplary photographic careers of this century\" - alongside Edward Steichen, Bill Brandt and Henri Cartier-Bresson. He himself had no dearth of famous names in the fields of both photography and literature to accompany his volumes of images: from Mark Haworth-Booth and Harold Rosenberg, James Baldwin and Truman Capote to Arthur Miller and George Wallace. </p> <p>Avedon was born in New York; his father owned a shop on Fifth Avenue. At 12 years old, he joined the YMHA camera club - an early photograph shows him with his Kodak Box Brownie in Central Park in 1935. He attended DeWitt Clinton high school in the Bronx, where he was co-editor, with James Baldwin, of the Magpie, the school's literary magazine, and became poet laureate of New York high schools. </p> <p>From the start - after war service in the photography section of the US merchant marines - Avedon was linked to fashion, fashion magazines and Irving Penn. Never more so than in Helmut Gernsheim's oft-reiterated comments of their \"creation of a contemporary style\", utilising \"the same strength\" of assigning \"monumentality\" to their subjects. </p> <p>But whereas Penn might go for the oddest juxtapositions - like turning South Sea islanders in warrior armour into fashion plates - Avedon eschewed anything that might intervene in the arresting clarity and deceptive simplicity of the early portraits. </p> <p>Attached, aged only 21, to Harper's Bazaar, he had established his own studio a year later. His studies at New York's New School for Social Research, under the legendary Alexei Brodovitch (where Diane Arbus and Eve Arnold, among others, also trained), led directly to his appointment as a staffer on Harper's, where Brodovitch and Carmel Snow were commissioning editors. He stayed from 1945 to 1965, before branching out into Vogue, working under Diana Vreeland and Alexander Liberman (from 1966), and at the New Yorker, where, in 1992, he became the magazine's first staff photographer. </p> <p>It was the glossy, east-coast magazines which provided the skeleton on which all the other myriad Avedon projects were fleshed. Partly, perhaps, a question of being in the right place at the right time: one could not invent a more appropriate outlet for the stark, but often naturally lit, portraits of models, artists, the famous and the infamous. </p> <p>Despite Avedon's protestations against daylight, he had an even greater resistance to shadows - including those backdrop rims thrown up by flash. Something of the extraordinary print quality of those large-format black-and-white investigations has to be due to Avedon's printers, especially Earl Steinbicken. </p> <p>Avedon's own interest was always in the people, never in the fashions. In fact, the models tended to add a layer of complication to what he fundamentally believed was the relationship between photographer and sitter. As he said: \"A photographic portrait is a picture of someone who knows he (sic) is being photographed, and what he does with this knowledge is as much a part of the photograph as what he's wearing or how he looks.\" </p> <p>In the case of the model, of course, she was performing as a clothes horse, wearing the outfits and makeup assigned, and not necessarily presenting herself as she might choose. Yet it was Avedon's conviction that \"We all perform\" - with its necessary corollary that \"I trust performances\" - that allowed both for the model's interpretation, actor-like, of a given role, and his own refusal to distinguish between \"the named and unnamed\" (in New Yorker terms, the famous and the rest). </p> <p>Initially inspired by the 1930s imagery of the great Hungarian Martin Munkacsi, who photographed fashions as if they were battleships, Avedon democratised the image, at least partly by removing it from its setting. (Even the portrait of Red Owens, Oil Field Worker, Oklahoma, 1980 has the raggedy-overalled, bearded stevedore doused in black viscosity aqainst a bare white backcloth.) </p> <p>Many photographs also include the dark border running around the rim of the square-format negative, as though proclaiming \"right, now you don't need to frame me any other than how the photographer did\". And many of his exhibitions, including the major retrospective which travelled to the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1994-95 followed that line. </p> <p>The exercise in democratising the image paradoxically had its own fiercely political implications. Avedon protested too much in insisting that he concentrated on surfaces because that was where his faith lay. By concentrating on the great unnamed of the United States, he gave us In The American West (1985, in which Red Owens appeared), about as different from Robert Frank's Americans as any study could be. By using an 8 x 10 view camera and homing in on every detail, he rendered his subjects again as much a set of graphic compositions as he did his fashion models in their swirling dresses. </p> <p>The paradox lies in his own assertion that the moment an emotion enters into a portrait, it becomes less a statement of fact than of opinion. This puts the onus of response from the photographer on to the viewer. A wide-angle lens, used in closeup, enhanced the sense of distortion, magnifying minor defects, sometimes horrifying the viewer. </p> <p>Twenty years earlier, the initially shocking, but ultimately sentimental tome Nothing Personal (1964), opened with a foggy double-spread frontispiece of a man, wearing only trunks, spectacles and a wristwatch, kneeling before an elaborate sandcastle. It closes with even softer-washed portraits of a loving couple, the woman heavily pregnant, cavorting in the sea-shallows, and of a man holding his infant up out of the water balanced on the palm of his hand. Between the two there are posed versions of numerous rites of passage. </p> <p>That Penguin Books would have even considered doing as unconventional and giant a volume as this testified to Avedon's clout. </p> <p>The text was by James Baldwin, who wrote that \"the myth tells us that America was full of smiling people ... the relevant truth is that the country was settled by a desperate, divided, and rapacious horde of people who were determined to forget their pasts and determined to make money. We certainly have not changed in this respect, and this is proved by our faces, by our children, by our absolutely unspeakable loneliness, and the spectacular ugliness and hostility of our cities.\" </p> <p>Avedon just focused on the faces. In 1976, he devised a Who's Who Of America in the run-up to the presidential elections. Sixty-nine members of The Family - those with the intellectual, economic and political power - appeared in Rolling Stone. They did not present pretty pictures and Avedon himself reacted with characteristic self-negation: \"I strongly voice my emotions in my photographs ... this is a composite portrait of the power elite, but I feel nothing at all for the majority of these people.\" He goes further, denying not only any personal responses, but any political or moral ones by adding, \"I'm not looking to offset Republicans against Democrats, good against bad.\" </p> <p>His goal was to reverse the tradition, voiced by Julia Margaret Cameron, of using portraiture to allow the outer form to reveal the inner spirit. Avedon was in search of the inner spirit alright, but was hijacking the former preserve of the postwar humanist photographic tradition, in searching for something generic outside of their established domain of street photography. </p> <p>Even the images which most promote the child-as-father-to-the-man in the opening and closing shots of the deliberately named Nothing Personal are non-specifically misty. His defence, in the face of concerted attack for the series on his cancer-stricken father (1969-73), was that it was not the death scenes of Jacob Israel Avedon but rather of everyman. </p> <p>Last month, Avedon suffered a stroke while taking pictures in San Antonio, Texas, for a piece for the New Yorker called \"On Democracy\". He was married twice. His first marriage was to Dorcas in 1944; he married Evelyn in 1951, with whom he had one son. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Richard Avedon, photographer, born May 15 1923; died October 1 2004</p>",
  "<p>The perky pink drink in a thin martini glass that the girls in backless tops were sipping (post-yoga class) at fashion parties all season is not to be mistaken for that Sex And The City staple, the Cosmopolitan. The latest cocktail to become ubiquitous is the watermelon martini. Actually, it's not a martini at all (how could it be with all that fruit?), but it's a snappy name, so we'll stick with it. </p> <p>I tend to think that such concoctions are better drunk in bars than at home, but this is such a good, and easy, showpiece drink, it's worth knowing how to make it. It gives quite a sugar rush, and is also reminiscent of those dusty holidays when you buy thirst-quenching watermelons at the roadside. Also, it is very chic and, in horrid, rainy October, a little reminder of the gleam of summer sun can raise the spirits no end. </p> <p>But there is a snag. Even the ripest, most richly scented melons seem to lose flavour when made into cocktails, as I discovered when I mixed a pounded charentais with golden rum. The professional's answer is to add either a slug of watermelon liqueur plus gomme syrup (a bit of sweetness always brings out the flavour in fruit - think of how a sprinkling of sugar changes the flavour of strawberries) or a splash of watermelon syrup. </p> <p>Problem is, these are hard to come by. The French company Monin (maker of the syrups that most of the high street coffee chains stock to add to lattes and so on) recently added watermelon to its delicious range of flavours, but the only place you can get hold of it in the UK is on the internet - <a href=\"http://www.b-opie.com\">b-opie.com</a> has added it to its online shop range especially for Guardian readers. It is not cheap, either: minimum purchase is a two-box set, which need not be two of the same flavour, at \u00a34.98 a bottle plus \u00a37.50 shipping. But it's worth it if you're having a party or want an unusual present. </p> <p>Failing that, find the tastiest watermelons you can and add only the tiniest dribble of gomme to enhance their natural flavour. Simply take four two-inch chunks of melon flesh and, using a pestle, pound them in the bottom of a cocktail shaker to release all the juice. Chill for a bit, if you have the time. Add three capfuls of chilled vodka, as well as your gomme or watermelon syrup (a small dash will do in either case). Shake with ice, then strain into a martini glass and serve. This is a bit too sweet to go with savoury nibbles. And if your melons are tasty enough on their own, make it with just the melon and vodka, and serve with feta, mint leaves and small black olives - a kind of solid-liquid Greek salad.</p>",
  "<p>Sam Clark comes tripping into the square in a tiny Andalucian village in the hills of Las Alpujarras. He is wearing a dark blue linen shirt, calf-length beige cut-offs, sandals and a cream peaked golf cap. Spot the Englishman. </p> <p>Sam - Samuel - Clark is quintessentially English. English in a rather old-fashioned way. His jaw is firm, his hair flops down over his broad forehead. He is lanky and shy and charming. So sorry, he says, but Sam - his wife, Samantha - isn't here. She is taking their two children, Luke and Eve, out on an expedition. Luke is four, he explains, and Eve two, and two small children need endless diversion. </p> <p>Sam and Sam Clark are something of a phenomenon in the restaurant world - aside from the name, which makes writing about them slightly confusing. Together with Mark Sainsbury, they own and run Moro, in Exmouth Market, in the Clerkenwell area of London, which has proved a tremendous popular as well as critical success. It's a relaxed, informal place specialising in what the Good Food Guide described in the restaurant's early days as \"the culinary legacy of the Moorish occupation of Spain from the eighth to the 15th centuries\". Nigel Slater is an enthusiast: \"You might catch a touch of saffron or cumin, of paprika, pepper or pomegranate, yet no matter how often you visit, there is always something you have never tasted before - membrillo, perhaps, or manchego, esqueixada or mojama.\" Moro celebrates its eighth anniversary this year, with no sign that its popularity is on the wane. </p> <p>\"We were lucky,\" says Sam as he sits in the sitting-cum-dining room of Casa Moro, the house that he and Samantha bought in the village four years ago and have been renovating and adding to ever since. From the outside the house looks small, painted white as is the local custom, but once inside it is not unlike the Tardis, extending magically up, down and sideways in a series of jumbled rooms. The shutters are closed against the ferocious heat. On the table is a bowl of olives swimming in rich, golden-green oil, a small wooden board on which sit thin slices of chorizo and a bag of short, stumpy breadsticks that snap explosively in the mouth. Sam is tearing yesterday's bread into chunks and putting them into a bowl. He pours on a splash or two of vinegar - \"from a neighbour\" - and then a gurgle or three of olive oil. </p> <p>\"When we decided to set up on our own, the obvious thing would have been to do Italian food,\" says Sam, \"but we couldn't have been another River Cafe, where we had both worked. We loved it there, and we have a huge respect for Rose [Gray] and Ruthie [Rogers], but you can't copy them. The River Cafe is unique. And we didn't want to be just another Italian restaurant. At that time, no one was doing Spanish or North African food really seriously in London, and those seemed good places to start. I knew a bit about Spanish food, which I liked a lot. So we spent three months in a camper van, travelling all over Spain and Morocco collecting recipes, and then opened the restaurant.\" </p> <p>He chops some onion and garlic with that mesmerising speed of the professional chef, then peels a lumpy cucumber and roughly chops that, adding each ingredient to the bowl as he goes. Everything has a deceptive ease about it. He quarters some cardinal-red tomatoes that are just golden at one end, then breaks them up in the bowl still further with his hands, squeezing out the seeds. Then he moves through into the tiny kitchen with its laden plate racks, sink, ordinary domestic cooker, cupboards bursting with kitchen impedimenta, restricted worksurface cluttered with peppers and heads of garlic, containers of salt, teapot, coffeepot, bits and bobs. He pulls a hand blender out of a stuffed drawer with some difficulty and, moving various bottles and bric-a-brac out of the way, plugs it into a wall socket. </p> <p>\"The Spanish housewives love these,\" he says. \"They use them all the time.\" Then he reduces the contents of the bowl to a liquid mush. He strains the resulting pink liquid through a kind of conical colander into another bowl. He puts a handful of ice cubes into the soup and pops it into the freezer box at the top of the fridge. \"Gazpacho,\" he says. \"It'll be ready in 10 minutes or so.\" </p> <p>Their first book, Moro, The Cookbook, was a phenomenon in itself. It has sold more than 100,000 copies in hardback and paperback, which, for authors without the platform of a regular cookery slot in a national or Sunday newspaper or a TV series to back it up, is prodigious. The recipes were tempting and accessible and the resulting dishes had the robust, well-defined flavours that are the Clarks' hallmark. </p> <p>The new book, Casa Moro, explores the same Muslim Mediterranean and Catholic Spanish culinary and cultural universe as the first, but with a rather different emphasis. The recipes may be culled from Spain, Turkey and Morocco among other countries, but, as the photographs make clear, this is family food, the kind of food they have been making for me at Casa Moro. Indeed, there is a section devoted to the seasonal dishes of the Alpujarras. As Samantha says, \"This is a book for the home.\" </p> <p>\"When I first tasted penne all'arrabbiata at the River Cafe,\" Sam remembers, \"I thought it was one of the most wonderful things I had ever eaten. And what is it? Just pasta with olive oil, garlic, tomatoes - tinned tomatoes - and chilli. I love that essential simplicity, but it also has intensity, vividness and balance. There's a kind of wholeness about a dish of that kind. It's rooted in the country it comes from. I think that's what cooking is about.\" </p> <p>Both of them first experienced the joys of good cooking as children. Samantha says that her mother was an excellent home cook, and remembers warmly visits to her grandmother's house in the south of France - \"before it was spoiled by Brigitte Bardot and Roger Vadim\". </p> <p>Casa Moro and the Andalusian village are about as far removed from the self-regarding world of the London restaurant scene and the bustling buzz of Exmouth Market as it is possible to imagine. There, the contemporary constants of restaurant life - battles with suppliers, two energy-sapping performances a day, sniping critics, rules, regulations, staff, profit, loss. Here, the constants seem eternal - the heat, the cold, sunshine, water, survival. Time has a different pulse here. It seems to run more slowly, more steadily, compared with the immediate, febrile, fitful beat of London. </p> <p>Sam points out of the window to a tiny field on the other side of the lane. \"It's a real marker for the seasons,\" he says. \"If we come here in January, we'll see the man who owns it sowing the wheat. In spring, it turns that fresh, pale green as it sprouts. Then, in summer, it'll be golden brown, and in the autumn we watch the man and his wife cutting it, by hand, with scythes, you know, with long, regular sweeps, so that the bundles fall perfectly one after the other.\" </p> <p>The 10 minutes have passed and we eat the gazpacho. It is cool, elegant, clean and gently penetrating. It is as easy to eat one, two, three bowls as it had appeared to be to make. Then we have huevos revueltos con morcilla - loosely scrambled eggs with black pudding. There were runner beans in the mix, too, but neither of us knew the Spanish for runner beans. The dish was mild, gentle, soothing. </p> <p>Presently, Samantha, Luke and Eve return in the usual noisy tumble that goes with two young children. Samantha has the same reserve and charm as her husband. She is watchful, too, and tranquil in the midst of the surrounding noise and activity. There is nothing cynical or vain or egocentric about either of the Clarks. They have never been part of the cheffy circuit. When they eat out, they prefer the Turkish, Thai and Vietnamese eating places of north London to the sleek chic of the gastro-zeitgeist. A natural shyness, inherent seriousness and sense of professional responsibility have meant that, with the exception of a short-lived bit of empire-building involving a restaurant called Le Maquis, a modern French outfit that never matched Moro's flair or individuality, Moro has occupied all their energies. </p> <p>They speak about the restaurant and the people who work there with warmth and affection, and each year they take on a trainee chef as part of Jamie Oliver's Cheeky Chops charity. Samantha worked with Oliver at the River Cafe and speaks highly of his energy, skill and commitment, as well as of the benefits of the scheme. \"We notice that even a short time in the kitchen can really help build their self-esteem and confidence. You can see them blossom.\" </p> <p>The arrival of Luke and Eve lessened the Clarks' taste for the industry whirligig still further. Sam points out, \"Every day in the restaurant is like giving a very taxing performance. Between that and the demands of the children it doesn't leave a lot of energy for anything else.\" This is one reason the new book took rather longer to write than they had expected. They had to take it in turns to disappear to Casa Moro for a few weeks at a time just to get it done, and the house became the heart of the book. </p> <p>They never set out to buy the house. \"I was just playing around on the internet,\" says Samantha, \"really just learning what it could do. And I typed in Andalusia to see what came up and, before I realised what was happening, I was looking at all these estate agents' particulars for farmhouses and other buildings. And then, of course, I couldn't stop there ...\" </p> <p>The introduction to the new book takes up the story: \"It was quite by chance we found this place, and when we got out the map, we realised we must have passed through the Alpujarras, the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, in our camper van eight years earlier. We took a small road that led to a pueblo (village) and, folding in the wing mirrors, squeezed the car through the narrow streets and parked. We walked up a lane until we came to a stone wall with a warped wooden door. After a couple of kicks it swung open to reveal a neglected garden, overgrown fig, jasmine, brambles and wild garden, and at the end was a small dwelling.\" </p> <p>The wooden door in the wall has since been replaced by one that isn't warped, but the fig is still there, and the jasmine and wild grasses. A child's paddling pool occupies a large part of one side of the small garden, and a table made of a door covered by a sheet of glass on waffle building blocks the other. And all around are the Alpujarras, arid, burnt-brown in high summer. The sides of the hills - they are not quite mountains - are precipitous, rocky and austere. But terraces have been quarried out of them on which olive and almond trees are drawn up in ranks. Marcona almonds, treasured for their sweet, mild flavour and flat shape, are the major product of this part of Spain. There are other trees, too - walnuts, persimmons, pomegranates and poplars - further down the slopes, hazy through the dusty gold of the late afternoon sun. </p> <p>While they prepare dinner, Sam and Sam switch effortlessly back and forth between cooking and child-minding, each picking up where the other left off, needing no word of explanation or direction. Living and working together \"took a bit of getting used to\" when they got married in 1996 after meeting while cooking at the Eagle in Clerkenwell. But they now seem perfectly in tune with one another - a kind of seamless team, rather at odds with their disjointed family histories. </p> <p>Both were brought up by their mothers, although they maintain good relations with their fathers. Perhaps this is why they show such patient and minute involvement with Luke and Eve. Sam manages to fit in a game of what he calls Mr McGregor between cooking duties. It involves arranging the furniture around the sitting room to provide various boltholes for Peter Rabbit in the form of a shrieking Luke, who dashes from one to the other, one step ahead of Mr McGregor in the form of Sam. At one point, Samantha apologises for not talking more: \"The children,\" she says, \"they take up a lot of time.\" </p> <p>There is an almost hippyish innocence about their way of life, sorted between their house in north London, the restaurant and Casa Moro, bounded by friends and food and children. Do they ever fight? Rarely over food, says Samantha, directing the question to the area that is fundamental to their relationship. \"We have both worked in the same restaurants, so our approach to cooking is very similar.\" They discuss food constantly, assessing the quality of the peaches, greengages, olives, chorizo, mulling over the merits of wild rabbit as opposed to farmed. They communicate through food. It becomes a domestic lingua franca. But they are no food snobs. Luke and Eve complain of hunger pangs and are quietened with a bowl of chocolate-flavoured cornflakes - quietened, that is, until the flakes become instruments of war. Tomato ketchup has its place in the kitchen cupboard, too, and \"I have a weakness for good sausages between bad bread,\" says Sam. </p> <p>That evening, we sit at the table outside eating kid - \"from a woman who lives in the next village up the hill. You can get really good ingredients around here. The market's aren't that good, but there are decent food shops in the bigger village down the road.\" The kid has been marinated and then grilled over an open fire. It has the spicy sweetness of an animal that had grazed on the aromatic scrub of the hills, overlaid by the caramel and faint edge of crisp, burnt surface. There is a dish of aubergines and pinenuts to go with it, and a plate of sliced tomatoes seasoned with sweet white onion and dressed just in olive oil, and red wine to drink. </p> <p>This part of Andalusia, says Sam, was until recently the poorest in Europe - would have been a lot poorer, too, had it not been for the complex network of irrigation channels built by the Moors in the 13th century and still in prime working order today, channelling water from the snow-fed rivers high in the Sierra Nevada, coursing down the hillsides to water small fields of beans, tomatoes, courgettes and other vegetables. He likes this connection between the past and the present. It is the kind of connection that informs their food. </p> <p>\"Of course, there is a historical connection between the cooking of North Africa and Spain,\" he says. \"They have so many ingredients in common - almonds, rice, aubergines, pinenuts. Spanish food is richer and earthier, I think. You get those wonderful deep flavours that come from slow-cooking techniques, as well as the use of oil, garlic, onion, pimenton, saffron and chorizo. And I love the way they add richness to richness, like adding a lump of pork fat to chickpeas when you are cooking them, to give that extra depth. North African cooking is lighter. You also find slow-cooking techniques there - North African tagines give you the same kind of richness that you find in Spanish braises and pot roasts - but, on the whole, the food is lighter and fresher-tasting. They use yogurt, preserved lemons, parsley, mint and spices such as cumin, cloves and cinnamon.\" </p> <p>\"We are always looking for those kinds of qualities in food,\" he continues. \"I don't think we are too concerned about authenticity. For example, in the restaurant we'll put, say, two vegetables on a plate with the main meat or fish, which is something no Spaniard would do. Every chef tries to put their own mark on a dish, but as soon as you do that, is a dish 'authentic' any more, in the pure sense of the word? Even in the restaurant, the chefs we work with don't always do things the way we would do them. Sometimes we come across a dish and we think, well, we can tweak it this way or that way, add this or that. But we try to remain true to the spirit of the original dish. It should always come back to that combination of intensity, directness and balance.\" </p> <p>These qualities have their foundation in the finest ingredients. When the Clarks opened Moro, they were forced to make weekly shopping trips to a Turkish supermarket in Dalston, north-east London, to buy what they needed. Now suppliers are beating a path to their door. Nevertheless, there is a thoughtful addendum to the Casa Moro cookbook in which they lay out the principles that guide their purchasing policies - organic, British, where possible, including vegetables and fish from sustainable sources - and provide a list of suppliers. </p> <p>Where next? Luke starts nursery school soon, so Samantha is looking forward to increasing the number of shifts she does at the restaurant - \"I'm really itchy to get into the kitchen more\" - albeit working at different times from her husband, so that they can maintain a constant presence for Luke and Eve. And then there's the constant search for new ideas, recipes, inspirations. They like to change the menu at Moro every two weeks or so, and they are planning a trip to the Lebanon, the cooking of which they have yet to explore seriously. </p> <p>And another book? They smile enigmatically. </p> <p><strong>Potato cakes stuffed with minced lamb and pine nuts</strong><br> </p> <p>We think this street food comes from Iran, but these flavours could just as easily appear in Lebanon or Syria. At the restaurant, we serve them with a little yogurt and salad. You could follow this recipe to make a type of shepherd's pie for two. Omit the flour with the potatoes and instead add 300ml warm milk, then assemble and cook as for a shepherd's pie. Makes 4 cakes. </p> <p>For the potato dough </p> <p>700g potatoes (Desir\u00e9e, Cyprus or King Edwards), skins on<br> 1 rounded tbsp plain flour, plus extra for dusting<br> Sea salt<br> </p> <p>For the lamb filling </p> <p>25g butter<br> 2 tbsp olive oil<br> large or 1 medium onion, finely chopped<br> 1 tsp ground cinnamon<br> 2 pinches freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg<br> 3 cardamom pods, black seeds only, ground to a fine powder<br> 3 cloves, ground with a pinch of salt to a powder<br> 200g finely minced lamb shoulder<br> 50g pine nuts, lightly toasted or fried until golden<br> 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e<br> 3 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> </p> <p>To cook and serve </p> <p>Olive oil<br> 1 bunch wild rocket, dressed with 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper<br> 200g Greek yogurt, thinned with 2 tbsp milk and seasoned with 1 garlic clove crushed with salt<br> A few pickled chillies, or 1 lemon, cut into wedges<br> </p> <p>To make the dough, boil the potatoes whole in salted water until cooked but not mushy: if they start to break up, they will absorb more water, which may affect the way they handle and fry. Drain well for 10 minutes. Then, while they are still warm, peel and mash. Stir in the flour and season with salt. The potato dough is now ready. </p> <p>While the potatoes are boiling, make the filling. Melt the butter with the olive oil over a medium to high heat. When the butter begins to foam, add the onion and soften until it is sweet and slightly caramelised. Now add all the spices and cook for a minute. Add the lamb, stirring and breaking it up with a spoon as it begins to cook. Stop stirring for a minute or two, so the lamb has a chance to stick to the pan and colour. This will add depth of flavour to the dish. You should cook the lamb for about 5-8 minutes until nicely browned. Finally, stir in the pine nuts, tomato pur\u00e9e, 2 tablespoons water and the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside until cool enough to handle. </p> <p>To prepare the potato cakes, first wash and dry your hands, then flour them. Divide the dough into four balls. Keeping the surface well dusted with flour, flatten one ball to a disc 1cm thick. Put 2 tablespoons of filling in the centre, and bring up the sides of the dough to enclose the meat. Place on a floured surface. Neaten the shape of the cake and patch up any cracks and gaps. The result should look like a round patty 10cm across and 3-4cm thick. Repeat with the other balls of dough. These cakes will keep in the fridge for one or two days, as long as there's enough flour to prevent them from sticking (but the fresher they're eaten, the better). </p> <p>Cover the bottom of a large frying pan generously with oil, about 3-4mm deep, and place over a medium to high heat until nearly smoking. Gently lift up the cakes with a fish spatula and lower into the oil one by one. Do not disturb until they are a dark golden colour and crispy, then turn carefully to colour the other side. When they are done, take out and dab off any excess oil with kitchen paper. Keep warm in a low oven, or serve immediately with the rocket, yogurt and chillies or lemon. </p> <p><strong>Moroccan bread salad with grilled green peppers and tomatoes</strong><br> </p> <p>This is a version of the classic Moroccan salad of grilled green peppers and tomatoes with the addition of bread and nutty argan oil. If you cannot find argan oil, use olive oil. Serves 6-8 as a mezze, 4 for a starter or light meal. </p> <p>4 green peppers, grilled and peeled<br> 225g ciabatta, half the crust removed<br> 600g cherry or any sweet tomatoes, peeled, cut into quarters or eighths<br> 4 tbsp fresh coriander leaves<br> 2 tbsp roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> 120g oily black olives<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> </p> <p>For the dressing </p> <p>1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste with salt<br> 1 rounded tsp lightly pan-roasted cumin seeds, roughly ground<br> 1 tbsp sweet red-wine vinegar<br> 100g tomatoes, sliced and pur\u00e9ed to juice<br> 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br> 3 tbsp argan oil, plus 1 extra tbsp mixed with tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. While the peppers are charring, break up the bread into bite-sized pieces and place on a roasting tray. Put in the oven for 10 minutes until lightly toasted. Meanwhile, peel and tear the peppers into strips and make the dressing. In a bowl, mix the garlic with the cumin, vinegar, tomato juice, salt and black pepper. Add the olive oil and the 3 tablespoons of argan oil and whisk well. Taste for seasoning. </p> <p>When the bread is ready, transfer to a large salad bowl and pour over half the dressing. Give it a good toss and allow to sit for a few seconds before adding the peppers, tomatoes, herbs and olives. Pour on the remaining dressing, toss again and check the seasoning. Serve with the remaining argan and olive oil drizzled on top. </p> <p><strong>Mussels with harissa</strong><br> </p> <p>Serves 6-8 as a mezze, 4 for a starter or light meal. </p> <p>1kg mussels or small-to-medium clams<br> 4 tbsp olive oil<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 100g harissa<br> 3 tbsp roughly chopped fresh coriander<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling<br> </p> <p>Wash the mussels under cold water, discarding any that are open or broken. Clean well and pull off any beards. Drain. In a large saucepan, heat the oil over a medium heat. When hot but not smoking, add the garlic and fry for a few seconds until it just begins to colour. Add the mussels, the harissa and half the coriander, and cook, covered for the first 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the mussels begin to open and release their juices, shaking the pan as you go. Then cook uncovered for a further minute or two until the shells have opened fully. (Throw away any that are still closed.) Taste for seasoning; the mussels may need a little salt. Serve immediately with the remaining coriander, an extra drizzle of olive oil over the top, and bread. </p> <p><strong>Lomo con vinagre de Jerez (pork loin pot-roasted with sherry and sherry vinegar)</strong><br> </p> <p>The complex flavours of sherry and sherry vinegar make a wonderful sweet-sour sauce to complement this dish. Serves 4-6. </p> <p>1-1.5kg boned organic or free-range pork loin, trimmed of most of its fat, or lean belly, skin off<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> 2 tbsp olive oil<br> 75g butter<br> 2 medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced<br> 4 sprigs fresh thyme, or a pinch of dried thyme<br> 2 bay leaves (preferably fresh)<br> 300ml Pedro Xim\u00e9nez, or sweet oloroso sherry<br> 100ml sherry vinegar<br> 100g raisins<br> </p> <p>Season the pork well with salt and pepper. Place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the olive oil. When hot, lower the pork into the pan and seal until just golden brown on all sides and both ends. Remove the pork and set aside briefly. Still over a medium heat, add the butter and, when it foams, the onion with a pinch of salt, and fry for 10 minutes until sweet, stirring occasionally. Pour off any excess oil, then add the thyme, bay leaves, sherry, sherry vinegar and raisins, and turn the heat to low. Return the pork to the pan, cover with baking paper or tin foil and put the lid on. Cook slowly for 1-1.5 hours or until the meat is just cooked through but still juicy, turning occasionally, so it cooks evenly. To determine whether the pork is cooked, gently push a sharp knife or metal skewer into the centre of the meat. Count to 10 and pull out. Touch the area above your top lip gently with the end of the skewer. If it is hot, the meat is cooked. A meat probe will give you a more accurate reading: as long as it registers 60-65C, the meat is cooked through but still juicy. </p> <p>If using belly pork, double the cooking time, or cook until it is tender. Make sure the juices do not simmer dry. Just add a little water from time to time. </p> <p>Let the pork rest for 10 minutes, covered loosely with foil, before slicing. Turn the heat under the sauce to high and reduce it for 5 minutes, until it is still runny but delicious. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. We serve this with mashed potato and braised spinach. </p> <p><strong>Barley bread</strong><br> </p> <p>As we were leaving Tangiers on our camper van trip, we bought a couple of breads on the street to eat for breakfast. One was flaky and oily, flavoured with onion and a little tomato; the other was a dense bread made from cracked barley. This bread felt primitive and ancient - more like polenta than bread. We like it lightly grilled and eaten with butter and other accompaniments. Serves 4. </p> <p>140g pearl barley<br> 1.6 litres water<br> 1 tsp fine sea salt<br> Olive oil, for grilling or frying<br> </p> <p>Combine the barley, water and salt in a medium to large saucepan and bring to a good simmer. Stir from time to time with a spoon to stop it sticking on the bottom, and cook for about 1 hour, until the total volume has reduced by half. Take care at the end of cooking, as the mixture may bubble like hot lava and could burn you. Use an electric hand-held blender or food processor to roughly pur\u00e9e half the barley, return to the pan and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat and spread out on an oiled plate or baking dish so that the mixture is about 2-3cm thick. Leave until completely cold, then cut into wedges. Drizzle both sides with a little olive oil and grill on a hot griddle or barbecue until crisp and slightly charred on both sides. If frying, place a frying pan over a high heat and add olive oil to a depth of 1-2mm. Cook crust-side down for 3-5 minutes until browned and crisp, then turn to cook the other side for just a minute or two to warm through. </p> <p>Serve with fresh cheese, cooked Moroccan salads, or yogurt seasoned with garlic and ground cumin. Alongside this, offer cucumber, carrot and radish crudit\u00e9s, mixed olives and generous sprigs of fresh herbs (mint, flat-leaf parsley and tarragon). </p> <p><strong>Dates with coffee</strong><br> </p> <p>The classic Arab flavours of coffee and cardamom go particularly well with dates. Although this dessert takes a matter of minutes to put together, it is best made at least one day before needed to allow the dates to soak up the coffee. Serves 4. </p> <p>500ml strong black coffee (espresso strength)<br> 1 tsp caster sugar<br> 20 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed<br> 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half<br> 200-250g Greek yogurt<br> </p> <p>Stone the dates carefully to keep their shape, and place in a bowl. Heat the coffee with the sugar and cardamom until just before it begins to boil, then pour over the dates. Leave to infuse with the cinnamon in the fridge overnight or for up to 2 days. Serve chilled with yogurt </p> <p>\u00a9 Samantha and Samuel Clark, 2004. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Extracted from Casa Moro by Sam and Sam Clark, published by Ebury Press on November 4. </p> <p><strong>Next week:</strong> more autumn recipes.

  "<p>\"Humor is a lot harder than - you know - serious stuff.\" Sarah Grimes tells her sister Emily, protagonist of Richard Yates's novel The Easter Parade, that she has given up on the \"humorous family-life sketches\" that she had been trying to write for some magazine. Her husband thought them interesting and well written, \"but he said they weren't funny\". Yates's fiction is sometimes darkly funny, especially in its dialogue, but always because it is \"serious stuff\".</p> <p>Indeed, the comedy takes its shade from the earnestness of the characters. In one delicious set-piece in Revolutionary Road, Frank's boss, Bart Pollock, takes him out for an alcohol-fuelled lunch and large slabs of his entrepreneurial philosophy. \"Frank, a lot of people tend to look down on plain old-fashioned selling today, but I want to tell you something...\" As the martinis sink in, dialogue seems to turn into monologue, its no-nonsense clich\u00e9s half-heard through Frank's befuddlement. \"I'll tell you something, Frank: I'm seldom wrong in my hunches about people.\" His talk flows on, oblivious to Frank's cynicism and timidity.</p> <p>But then all the pretentious or solemn talk is at a tangent to what characters really think. While April Wheeler spins conversational fantasies about a life of freedom in Paris, Frank silently regrets all the lies he has told her about his knowledge of the city and the language. Paris is the place to go, isn't it? \"With the advantage of your knowing the language and everything?\" \"Je suis, he practised to himself while April went on talking; tu es; nous sommes; vous \u00eates; ils sont.\" \"You know how the city's laid out and what the various neighbourhoods are like; that's important.\" In truth he knows no more of Parisian topography than he can recall from reading The Sun Also Rises in high school.</p> <p>There is something unpitying in Yates's detailing of these dialogues; his characters' aspirations and ideals are invariably made ridiculous. He had an ear for gruesome exchanges. The Easter Parade also has some choice examples: the protagonist's \"poet\" partner trying to get her interested in his writer's block, another maundering about the wife who has left him, her demented mother chatting quite normally, except for her conviction that her daughter is married to the president.</p> <p>In Revolutionary Road, the funniest exchanges involve John, the son of the Wheelers' neighbour, Mrs Givings, the real-estate broker who first found them their \"sweet little house\". John Givings, supposedly \"doing marvelously well as an instructor of mathematics at some Western university\", has in fact been confined in the local \"insane asylum\". Now he is allowed out for the day. Medical advice is that he might be taken to \"the home of some close friend\" - neutral territory, rather than his parents' own house. \"There still does seem to be a good deal of hostility concerning the, ah, home atmosphere and whatnot,\" observes the doctor, a nice professional pause before reaching for his euphemism.</p> <p>The Wheelers - young, modern, broad-minded - are chosen and agree. In one way this is a very old dramatic trick. There is scarcely a Jacobean tragedy that does not find space for the verbal capers of a madman, alone liberated to mock the tragic characters. John similarly obliges, saying what goes unsaid. As soon as he meets the Wheelers, unnerving with his jaunty cap and parody smile, he is spilling the beans as his appalled parents look on. Frank self-importantly tells him that he is quitting his job and \"taking off\". John recalls his mother saying something about this. \"She didn't say why, though; she just said it was 'very strange'.\" He splits the air with \"a bray of laughter\".</p> <p>The Wheelers, thinking themselves intellectual rebels, find it oddly congenial and Frank chats happily about \"the hopeless emptiness of everything in this country\". John is delighted. \" 'Wow,' he said. 'Now you've said it. The hopeless emptiness'.\"</p> <p>He and the Wheelers are comically pleased with each other. On his second visit, however, he finds that his hosts have abandoned their Paris plans and mad complicity turns to mockery. \"You figure it's more comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all... Am I getting warm?\" John is removed, lobbing cheerfully devastating (and accurate) observations about the Wheelers' disastrous marriage as he goes.

  "More than 800 illegal immigrants have landed on the southernmost shores of Italy in 24 hours, suggesting that people smugglers in Libya are organising a last-minute rush before Europe and Libya prepare to seal off the Libyan coastline. <p>The exhausted immigrants, mostly men, arrived in a few large and overloaded vessels on Thursday and yesterday morning, overwhelming the small island of Lampedusa, south of Sicily. </p> <p>The influx came as EU ministers clashed over a proposal to push fortress Europe's borders south, setting up asylum processing camps in north Africa, as Britain had proposed 15 months ago. </p> <p>French ministers, however, were critical of the idea, which was proposed by the German interior minister, Otto Schilly, as an attempt to deal with the toll of more than 5,000 migrants who have died trying to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe illegally so far this year. </p> <p>\"We are not taking part in this plan,\" the French interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, said. \"It will be very destabilising for these countries.\" </p> <p>On Friday, Italy flew hundreds of the newly arrived migrants back to Africa to relieve the facilities on Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost outpost and a first port of call for rickety ships crossing the Mediterranean from Libya and Tunisia. </p> <p>Most of those being sent back across the Mediterranean are Palestinian, Moroccan, Sudanese and Pakistani men who arrived in relatively good health, the police said. </p> <p>Germany revived the north African immigrant processing centre plan, with strong Italian backing, when scores of boats loaded with immigrants began washing up on Italy's southern coasts this summer. </p> <p>At the same time, Italy increased calls on the European Union to lift its economic embargo on Libya so that the country could buy the equipment it needs to patrol its coastline properly. </p> <p>Britain is believed to support the proposal as long as it does not undermine the right of individuals who arrive in Britain or other EU countries to claim asylum. The Home Office minister, Caroline Flint, yesterday highlighted an agreement with the Lebanon under which 145 migrants were detained in that country and returned home at a cost of \u00a338,000. </p> <p>It is believed bilateral agreements of this kind with countries outside the EU will form the first phase of a common European asylum policy.</p>",
  "Two people traffickers who smuggled children into the UK by posing as their parents were jailed yesterday for a total of three years. <p>Johar Shah and Alia Kanwal, both from Pakistan, brought a 12-year-old boy and two girls aged 10 and seven, into Heathrow airport by pretending to be a family. </p> <p>Once past immigration checks they handed the youngest child to relatives and the other two children to unidentified people waiting in the car park. </p> <p>The scam was discovered when the youngest girl was found wandering around Terminal Three later the same day in May this year. </p> <p>The couple were arrested when they returned to Heathrow two days later and attempted to bring forward their return flights on Saudi Arabian Airlines to Pakistan saying there had been \"a death in the family\". </p> <p>Sentencing Shah for 21 months and Kanwal for 15 months, Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson told them: \"I hope you both understand how seriously the courts regard this sort of behaviour.\" </p> <p>Shah, a father of six, pleaded guilty at Isleworth crown court to four charges of assisting the illegal entry of Kanwal and the three children, three of using false passports for the children and one of having custody of a forged passport for Kanwal. </p> <p>Shah, 36, told police he had been paid \u00a31,000 and expected a similar sum on his return to Pakistan. He said he had also been given $4,000 (\u00a32,200) as spending money and to show at the airport to ease his entry to Britain. </p> <p>Kanwal used a false passport bearing the name of Shah's wife, Majah, which he obtained by submitting a photograph of Kanwal instead of his wife to the Pakistan passport authority. The children named on the passport were the Shah's own children. </p> <p>Robert Meikle, prosecuting, said: \"The children named on the passport were the legitimate children of Shah and his wife. He pretended the three children he brought to this country were his.\" </p> <p>Kanwal, 25, a mother of three, admitted three charges of assisting the illegal entry of the children and one of using a false passport with intent to deceive. But she insisted she believed the children were Shah's own. </p> <p>She said she was told she would receive \u00a31,000 for bringing the children into the country. </p> <p>Kanwal was hysterical as her counsel, Nerida Harford-Bell, told the judge she was anxious to return home to her children, one of whom was not well. She told the court: \"She just wants to be deported home.\" </p> <p>Recommending the defendants' deportation, Judge McGregor-Johnson told them: \"These matters were not spur of the moment, they were pre-planned. I accept that neither of you were the organisers behind this whole scheme. </p> <p>\"But I am entirely satisfied, particularly having regard to the documents and money that you, Shah, were the more deeply involved.\" </p> <p>The seven-year-old girl has been taken into care. </p> <p>The two other children have never been found but police believe they may have been reunited with family members already living in Britain who paid for them to be brought over.</p>",
  "France will hold a referendum on Turkey's entry into the EU when the issue arises, and any further EU enlargement will also be subject to a popular vote, President Jacques Chirac said yesterday. <p>All member states will have to give their blessing before Turkey is allowed to join the EU, so Mr Chirac has in effect given the French people the power of veto - at an unspecified time - on Turkish accession. </p> <p>The president's support for a referendum is aimed at preventing French anxiety about Turkish membership influencing another referendum, on the EU constitution, which will be held next year. </p> <p>By separating the two issues, Mr Chirac has reduced but not eliminated the likelihood of France opposing the constitution. The constitution cannot be adopted if France does not back it. </p> <p>His announcement came just days after an opinion poll revealed that the majority of French adults were opposed to Turkey's immediate entry, concerned about a wave of immigration and its effect on jobs, and reluctant to embrace such a large and mainly Muslim country. </p> <p>Mr Chirac is a supporter of Turkish accession, but many of his colleagues in the UMP party are not. </p> <p>The prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, encapsulated French concern last week when he asked: \"Do we want the river of Islam to enter the riverbed of secularism?\" </p> <p>There have also been calls for a referendum from the extremely popular finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the foreign minister, Michel Barnier. </p> <p>After talks with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, in Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Chirac said: \"Let me reassure you right away: the French people will have their say.\" </p> <p>He said Turkey was not likely to be in a position to join the EU for 10 to 15 years. </p> <p>He had asked the government to prepare a constitutional amendment to guarantee that any enlargement of the EU - after the entry of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, which is already under way - should be put to a public vote rather than decided by parliament. </p> <p>He stressed that next year's vote on the EU constitution would have \"nothing to do with Turkey\". </p> <p>The Turkish prime minister, Tayyip Erdogan, said simply: \"May it be for the best.\" </p> <p>This week's opinion poll showed that although 56% of French people were hostile to the idea of Turkey joining immediately, 63% would support Turkey's entry in future if it made the necessary political and economic changes. </p> <p>The European commission is expected to recommend in a report next Wednesday that the EU opens membership talks with Turkey, and a precise start date given when EU leaders meet in December. </p> <p>The accession talks are expected to last several years. </p> <p>\"We have an interest in having Turkey with us,\" Mr Chirac said. </p> <p>The country had already made considerable progress by introducing democratic and economic reforms, but had not yet fulfilled all the terms for entry. </p> <p>\"It creates a prospect of democracy and peace taking root on the whole of the European continent ... so that we avoid the mistakes and violence of the past,\" he said. </p> <p>AP adds: Turkey yesterday cancelled a two-day gathering of foreign ministers from the EU and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Istanbul, after a dispute with the EU about the status of Turkish Cypriots. </p> <p>The meeting had been at improving relations between the two blocs. But Turkey and the EU failed - despite weeks of talks - to reach agreement on how to address the self-declared Turkish Cypriot state, which has observer status in the OIC.</p>",

  "<p>Does anyone remember the last time Hollywood released a movie that made Mexico seem like an attractive travel destination? Classics like Viva Zapata! and The Power And The Glory painted haunting images of this troubled nation as an impoverished hellhole; heart-rending tales like El Norte certainly didn't do much for the Mexican tourism business; 10 launched Bo Derek's gratuitous career and more recent offerings like Traffic make the country seem like the very last place you'd want to spend the weekend. And that's without even mentioning Sergio Leone's south-of-the-border shoot-'em-ups or Sam Peckinpah's peerless gore-fest The Wild Bunch, which portrayed old Mexico as a vicious, gladiatorial arena where you shot first, asked questions later, and then did some more shooting.</p> <p>These musings on the subject are prompted by the release of Tony Scott's bloodcurdling Man On Fire, which once again portrays America's neighbour to the south as a war zone dominated by murderous drug lords, corrupt policemen and crooked politicians. The film stars Denzel Washington as John Creasey, a semi-retired professional assassin, formerly in the employ of the United States government, who drifts south of the border in a futile attempt to get his life back on track. Hooking up with his old comrade-in-arms Christopher Walken, Washington half-heartedly takes a job as a private bodyguard for the supernaturally cute Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam), whose wealthy parents are terrified that she might be kidnapped and held for an enormous ransom.</p> <p>Tot and hit man immediately form an unlikely friendship. Washington teaches the little cutie competitive aquatics: she teaches him how to put down the whiskey flask long enough to crack a smile. But when the lovable tyke is abducted, Washington reverts to form and sets out on a crusade to wipe out every thug, crook, stool pigeon, rat, child molester, lowlife and dirty cop in the Mexico City metropolitan area.</p> <p>In the words of Walken, who has recently replaced John Malkovich as the industry's most beloved ham: \"Creasey is an artist. His canvas is death. And he is about to paint his masterpiece.\"</p> <p>Man On Fire is a reasonably effective action film, and Washington delivers yet another of his taut, unnerving performances, coming off here as a sort of African-American Clint Eastwood, a loner who lets his guns do the talking.</p> <p>But it doesn't make Mexico City seem like a particularly enticing locale. This got me to thinking about motion pictures that depicted certain cities and countries in such an electrifyingly repugnant fashion that I made a decision to scratch them off my list of desirable destinations forever.</p> <p>Midnight Express didn't do much for the Turkish tourism business, nor did Costa-Gavras's Missing help raise the tourist profile of Chile during the troublesome Pinochet years. To this list can be added City Of God (Brazil), The Quiet American (Vietnam), Deliverance (rural Georgia), The Killing Fields (Cambodia), Rambo III (Afghanistan), and In The Name Of The Father (Northern Ireland), to name but a few.</p> <p>Yet motion pictures need not be spectacularly violent and grim to make them seem unattractive to aspiring globetrotters. I personally have never had any great urge to visit Japan and, after I saw Lost In Translation, I had even less. Whether or not Sofia Coppola's charming little film about a washed-up actor marooned in Tokyo was fair to the people of Japan is open to debate, but with its spellbinding images of idiotic television personalities, asinine directors, addled youths and obsequious functionaries, Lost In Translation conveyed one and only one message to westerners: don't go there. You won't be able to sleep. You won't be able to communicate. And if you're not careful, you'll wind up in bed with a washed-out nightclub chantoosey whose bring-down-the-house number is the innocuous yet entirely revolting Midnight At The Oasis.</p> <p>Without a doubt, there is something unfair about the way the movie industry romanticises certain cities and slanders others. Photogenic cities like Paris and Rome are invariably the setting for heartwarming bagatelles like Roman Holiday and Amelie, whereas Saigon, Miami and Marseilles always seem like a good place to get your throat slit. One is thus left to ponder whether Sleepless In Asuncion or Blame It On Gdansk could have bolstered the images of those blighted metropolises, or whether a Notting Hill set in Stoke or Nottingham could have spiffed up the escutcheons of those much-maligned cities. Probably not: there is nothing in The Full Monty that would make anyone want to visit Sheffield, nothing in Flashdance that would make Pittsburgh seem more appealing, nothing in Billy Elliot that would make a blighted northern England seem like a more attractive tourist destination. Dreary motion pictures set in Belfast have had no positive effect on the economy or image of that troubled city.</p> <p>Years ago I met a man who headed an organisation called the Oklahoma State Film Commission. It was his job to fly out to Los Angeles every few weeks and try to persuade the powers-that-be to make more movies in one of America's least majestic, least photogenic states. It was not an easy task. The problem was, the last major motion picture to get made in Oklahoma was Twister, and, in all likelihood, the next one would be Twister II.</p> <p>It is a sad but undeniable fact that the public has preconceived notions about certain localities - Mexico dangerous, Oklahoma arid, rural America creepy, English Canada boring - that are difficult to dislodge. No one in his right mind is going to set a comedy in El Salvador or a coming-of-age tale in the Chechen republic. No one is going to try to make Munich seem like it's as much fun as Berlin, or Rotterdam the Dutch equivalent of Hong Kong. The cards have been dealt, and the hands must be played.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, the logic underlying of these decisions backfires. Last year, Touchstone released a predictable chick flick called Under The Tuscan Sun, based on the thunderously corny book of the same name. The movie starred Diane Lane, armed to the teeth with her arsenal of hackneyed facial expressions, as a middle-aged divorcee who treks to colourful Tuscany to get her life back together. Ostensibly, this was a movie designed to induce even more Americans to visit sunny Tuscany, as if 50 million yuppie Yanks who trek to Italy each spring in search of the perfect balsamic vinegar weren't enough. But after 113 minutes of canny workmen, feisty matriarchs, doe-eyed virgins and predatory Latin metrosexuals, I quickly decided that I'd be better off in Cardiff, Algiers or Newark, New Jersey. If Italians are as hokey and stereotypical as they are here I'm never going to Italy. All things considered, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. In fact, I'd rather be in Mexico City.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Man On Fire is out on Friday</p>",
  "<p>Barclays Bank was yesterday accused of playing a vital role in the financing of an Indian hydroelectric dam which will force up to 50,000 people from their homes. </p> <p>The Omkareshwar dam project, one of a series of large dams on the River Narmada in the state of Madhya Pradesh, will flood 30 villages and 93sq miles of forest and farmland. </p> <p>According to papers seen by the Guardian, no impact study has been done and no resettlement plans have been finalised. </p> <p>The World Bank, Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro have all refused to finance Omkareshwar and other large dams on the river because of environmental and social concerns. </p> <p>Protests have been going on for more than 10 years in the Narmada region, with thousands of people threatening to drown themselves rather than leave their homes. </p> <p>Activists such as the author Arundhati Roy have been imprisoned for trying to stop the dams, which would eventually force the relocation of more than 600,000 people. </p> <p>According to documents seen by the Guardian, the Indian government had asked Unit Trust of India and Barclays to help arrange the finance for the dam, to run over 14 years. </p> <p>Yesterday, in a statement, Barclays denied lending any of its own money to the scheme and claimed that its mandate from the Indian government had lapsed. </p> <p>\"As Barclays is neither providing finance for the project nor arranging finance we cannot comment further,\" it said. </p> <p>However, the bank did admit \"advising and assisting\" in the project. A spokesman would not confirm the extent of the fees earned in the deal. </p> <p>Barclays also helped arrange a \u00a328m loan for the corporate expenses of India's National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, the main sponsor of the scheme. It is unknown whether any of this money is being used for the Omkareshwar dam. </p> <p>The dam, which is in the early stages of construction, is intended to provide more than 500MW of electricity and to irrigate 147,000 hectares of land. It is already encountering concerted opposition by villagers. Rallies and demonstrations are expected to increase as construction nears completion in 2008. </p> <p>So far, 350 people from the small village of Panthiaji have been moved. </p> <p>\"Villagers were given no notice and made to destroy their own houses if they wanted land elsewhere,\" said Heffa Schucking, of the German human rights group Urgewald, which has returned from a factfinding mission. </p> <p>\"We had no choice,\" said one Panthiaji villager, Ramphere Yadav. \"We worked all night. We took our belongings, took down our roofs, and broke our homes because the pressure was so much. People were crying. We were in extreme distress. </p> <p>Neelabai, another former resident, said: \"In our original village we were happy. Now our life is full of hardships. </p> <p>\"We were not given agricultural land and we have no way of earning our living. This place is very remote.\" </p> <p>Ms Schucking said: \"Our team visited the resettlement sites for Panthiaji. The overall impression was of a refugee camp. Villagers were camping in makeshift tin sheds or tents. </p> <p>\"There is no electricity or amenities. At one of the sites, the water seemed to be contaminated, so that many of the villagers had become sick.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, more than 100 Indian and other pressure groups wrote to Barclays, asking it to clarify its position. </p> <p>\"We are especially disturbed that [the bank] has opted to back a project that is in such evident and flagrant violation of Barclays' principles\", said Johan Frijns of BankTrack, a network of groups that monitor the investments made by banks.</p>",
  "<p>It's that time of year when the corporate bandwagon begins to roll onto campus, with everything from company presentations to skills sessions and careers fairs on offer. If you're lucky they'll dish out some freebies. But other than knocking back the canap\u00e9s and ice cream, how should you handle the milkround?</p> <p>Arguably, the milkround has lost its bottle in recent years. These days it is more about marketing and brand awareness than recruiting. But here's how to make the most of what's left:</p> <p><strong>1. Start at the careers service</strong></p> <p>Your careers service oversees employer visits, so visit their website regularly to find out who's coming onto campus. \"Keep in touch with us,\" urges Jenny Goddard, careers adviser at Warwick University. \"There will be additions and amendments throughout the term.\" Many universities allow you to reserve your places online; so don't drag your feet. \"The most popular employers get booked up quickly,\" she adds. \"It's a shame because some students leave it too late and get disappointed.\"</p> <p><strong>2. Be prepared</strong></p> <p>Like any stage of the job application process, it pays to do your research. A general awareness of the company you are meeting will help, and some insightful questions will impress. If you aren't sure what kind of career you'd be interested in, however, there is nothing wrong with a more casual approach. \"Milkround events can also help you define your direction,\" argues Jenny Goddard. \"By going along you might learn about yourself and what is or isn't suitable for you.\"</p> <p><strong>3. Use your discretion</strong></p> <p>Dress smartly and appropriately (check the dress code in advance). Some presentations are held in local hotels, or employer offices, so buff up on the logistics to get there on time. Oh, and go easy on the freebies. \"Some organisations provide very generous hospitality,\" explains Jenny Goddard. \"That can be fun, but it's not the reason to go. Having a glass of wine and talking to a recruiter is a nice way of relaxing at the end of the day, but obviously you shouldn't judge a career by the quality of the nibbles.\"</p> <p><strong>4. Talk to people</strong></p> <p>Soak up the information at the session, but if you want to take full advantage, do some informal networking at the end. Many companies bring along recent graduate recruits, often from your university. Chat to them. (This is where you can ask those well-prepared questions). Use it as an opportunity to dig deeper into the company culture.</p> <p><strong>5. Don't expect a job offer</strong></p> <p>The milkround is primarily a marketing event, rather than a pretext to handpick the best students. \"I find that a lot of people assume a presentation is an interview, but they need to be aware that now isn't the time for us to make an informed decision,\" explains Suzy Style, graduate recruitment head at Accenture. \"On the other hand, we can certainly spot someone who has potential. Very often a rep will make a note of your name and perhaps buddy you through the application process.\"</p> <p><strong>6. Don't take it personally</strong></p> <p>Employers cherry pick the universities they will visit. However, if an organisation you like isn't attending your campus, you should still apply. With the best will in the world no company can get around every university. \"It doesn't mean we're not interested,\" explains Suzy Style. \"Proactive students often contact us asking whether we would mind if they attended a local presentation at another university. Usually there isn't a problem.\"</p> <p><strong>7. Attend anyway</strong></p> <p>Even if you find blue chip corporations a turn-off, attend anyway. Skills sessions can be particularly useful for interviews, CVs and applications. Presentations can also be informative as industry insights. \"If you wanted to learn about marketing, for example, finding out about Proctor &amp; Gamble's marketing scheme will be good for your research,\" adds Jenny Goddard.</p> <p><strong>8. Broaden your approach</strong></p> <p>Only a fifth of graduates are employed by UK blue chip companies every year, and limiting yourself to the employers who have big budgets to splash on milkround events will rule out plenty of interesting small-to-medium sized firms. \"There are many organisations who don't have the time or money to put on any presentations but are still interested in recruiting graduates,\" stresses Jenny Goddard. \"You just have to be more proactive.\"</p> <p><strong>9. Keep in touch</strong></p> <p>\"The best thing about the milkround is the opportunity to speak to people from the company,\" says Accenture's Suzy Style. \"Make the most of it and if you can get contact details of the particular representative you speak to, then follow up with them and they can support you through an application process.\" Take a note of their names and make sure you refer to them in your application or at interview. A touch of name-dropping never hurts.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barlowtom@hotmail.com\">barlowtom@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> 98 Reasons for Being</strong> by Clare Dudman 342 pp, Sceptre, \u00a316.99 <br> </p> <p>This is a second novel by a writer who has so far chosen to write about fairly obscure characters from German history, on this occasion Dr Heinrich Hoffmann, author of Struwwelpeter, the famous book of cautionary tales for children in unforgettable verse. Apparently Dr Hoffmann was not only a medical man but was also the superintendent of Frankfurt's lunatic asylum for many years. </p> <p>Now before you say, as one of my friends did, that this little-known fact is not in the least surprising, given the tone of this famous classic, you have to take a historical perspective. Although its black humour is now considered unsuitable for young children, it has to be remembered the book was written in 1845, and I am sure Queen Victoria and dear Albert, starting their family, thought it just the thing to inculcate proper behaviour in the young. Thumb-sucking and bad table manners were severely frowned upon. </p> <p>Clare Dudman has done a massive amount of research on both Hoffmann's institution and clinical practices of the period, and gives a copious and interesting bibliography. However, I was less interested in having the results of her research regurgitated in large chunks within the novel itself. There are more subtle ways of telling the reader of the bizarre medical practices of the period. As for her attempt to link particular incidents in the asylum with specific tales, even quoting entire texts at the end of chapters, this is at best specious. When a patient dies of anorexia we are given Kaspar refusing to eat his soup, with dire consequences. Though not featured as a character, we are even told about a woman who burned to death. </p> <p>The only tale that is really relevant, both for the period and the narrative (and what it tells us about Hoffmann himself), is the one about racial prejudice. This was the time of the notorious Judengasse in Frankfurt, and the central story in the novel is Hoffmann's relationship with a Jewish patient. Hannah has been seduced and jilted by a handsome young Gentile, and has become severely withdrawn. The seduction of innocent young girls may be a 19th-century clich\u00e9, but Hannah's inner thoughts are delicately handled, if a bit over-poetic at times, and her story is touching. Hoffmann decides to give her the talking treatment, as recommended by a Professor Heinroth, and in the process reveals a lot about his own life, his feeling of helplessness as a physician, his unsatisfactory marriage, and so on. A rather sad figure, no longer the man who wrote Struwwelpeter. By the end of the book Hannah has found her tongue, got over her lover, and decides it is time to leave. It is too: Hoffmann is falling for her. The main problem with this novel is the unsatisfactory structure. Dudman has created a sort of patchwork, but one that lacks a good underlying design. Too many characters, whether patients or people employed by the asylum, introduced too briefly, though frequently, who never really become clearly defined, and who do not further the narrative either. It is only Hannah who shows any progression. I suppose what would have made the book work is if Dudman had used the same black wit that distinguished Struwwelpeter. There is a hint of it in a character called Josef who wants to be a woman and ends up hanging himself. Just a glimmer of what might have been.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Nazi Chic? Fashioning Women in the Third Reich</strong> by Irene Guenther 499pp, Berg, \u00a355 <br> </p> <p>The knit jacket called a Berchtesgadener J\u00e4ckchen wasn't official uniform for young women in any Nazi organisation, but it met most National Socialist criteria for correct garb. It was German-made, by a small mill in Wiesbaden set up by a disabled veteran of the first world war; German in folk-costume styling, black with scarlet and green trim and pewter buttons stamped with edelweiss. It was a chic confection - ready-to-wear; or rather a schicke Konfektion, since all French-derived fashion terms had been Germanified during the first world war, and therefore a deserved bestseller among patriotic M\u00e4dchens; German ready-to-wear was of such high quality that even the French had had Paris designs mass-made sans labels over the border since the 19th century. </p> <p>You already know how this story ends, don't you? The veteran, Julius Hallheimer, was Jewish, and his business dwindled as the Nazis evicted Jews from economic life. His firm was Aryanised in 1938, handed over to an ex-employee: Hallheimer committed suicide in 1943, hours before the Gestapo arrived. By which time, judging from Irene Guenther's sustained research into the dearth of gear in the wartime Reich, even a ragged J\u00e4ckchen would have been precious, swappable for food if the garment hadn't already been requisitioned to warm the Wehr-macht on the Russian front. </p> <p>Guenther is sparing of personal stories in her analysis of what women wore, and were supposed to wear, under the Nazis; the few she chooses she uses with pitiless sympathy. First, however, she investigates the background of the German states and an inferiority complex about self-presentation that went back to the Franco-Prussian war, if not the 18th century. She stresses the seriousness of her subject, how it demonstrates Nazi self-deception in ideology, economics and organisation. She has a very original chapter about the National Fashion Institute, which planned tasteful colour cards for spring 1944, when the Fatherland stank for lack of soap and women knitted sanitary towels from unravelled burlap sacks. </p> <p>The Nazis wanted women to be traditional, in outfits sourced in Tracht folk costume, yet as modern as an Autobahn; to appear natural even if that meant bleaching their plaits with Schwarzkopf Extra-Blond shampoo; to wear uniform without aspiring to masculine privileges. But genuine farming females didn't have the time to raise flax and rear sheep, let alone spin and weave Tracht to support the Nazi attempt at autarky. It was urban women who bought factory-sewn Tracht copies, often from Jewish-owned department stores. And though the Nazis were anxious that German/Austrian style should be internationally influential, the world was in fact clad in Dirndl and Loden by 1938 because of the musical White Horse Inn, the Salzberg festival and, especially, the whim of Marlene Dietrich (by then a US citizen and an anti-Nazi). </p> <p>Anyway, the Reichsbrass, though they might personally incline to preposterous outfits (Goering wore thigh-high boots, transparent linen shirts and heavy eyeshadow), didn't fancy Gretchen types for anything but propaganda purposes. Hitler rescinded a decree so that Eva Braun could have her hair permed, and paid the bills for her French cosmetics and Ferragamo shoes from Italy. The F\u00fchrer himself must have authorised the dispatch of a courier from his Berlin bunker through the Russian-bombarded ruins to a salon to collect Eva's urgent order for the couture gown in which she married and committed suicide. </p> <p>Certain Berlin designers did surprisingly good business in glam frocks through the air raids, then repaired Russian uniforms and dressed the wives of Soviet occupiers before finally making their fortunes mink-stole-ing the jet set in the Adenauer years. </p> <p>There were little black farces. French fashion was condemned for years as decadent yet the German designer Hilda Romatski attended Schiaparelli's autumn 1939 collection in Paris and snipped off two of Elsa's signature \"S\" buttons, which she sewed side-by-side on one of her own suits: the theft was ignored in Germany - French creativity was to be plundered and the Reich planned to transfer the fashion industry to Berlin after Paris fell - but Romatski was accused of treason by a senior SS officer who thought she mocked his uniform. </p> <p>There were vast dark tragedies. \"Elegance will now disappear from Berlin along with the Jews,\" whinged Magda Goebbels, who bought from Jewish designers until they emigrated or were transported to the ghettos and the camps. Senior Nazis, including her husband, exhorted the homeland never to wear anything made by degenerate non-Aryans; yet by the time the Lodz ghetto was \"liquidated\" in 1944, other senior Nazis had made a profit of 46m marks from workshops that crafted felt flowers for hats and 400,000 pairs of army epaulettes, besides more essential wear, such as wooden-soled slippers, reserved for party officials or the black market. </p> <p>Concentration camp inmates sweatshopped for the Reich, too: women were worked to death minding mills, spinning rationed ersatz yardage from sawdust and food waste to uniform the military (the cloth almost dissolved in rain). Meanwhile, a few top hands refashioned quality materials, deposited in warehouses after the extermination of their owners, into clothes, including evening gowns, for SS families, mistresses and female guards. Two custom-made dresses a week per slave, to be picked up Sunday noon. </p> <p>Guenther never editorialises and the more insane the reality, the more calmly and carefully she balances her facts. In the spring of 1945, a season for which the Fashion Institute had not prepared a colour card - Prussian blue was by then out of date - Allied troops discovered the wife of a camp commandant hiding among her huge wardrobe of handtailored clothes and furs, a trousseau from the dead. The first postwar show did produce an unambivalent German fashion at last: the Flickenkleid, a dress patchworked from scraps of fabric and accessorised with a handbag woven from salvaged gas-mask straps.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Empire of the Wolves </strong> by Jean-Christophe Grang\u00e9 374pp, Harvill, \u00a310.99 <br> </p> <p>In Flight of the Storks, a change in migratory patterns led to a bizarre voyage of destiny, ending in colonial rapacity and bad science that recalled the gothic surrealism of George Franju's horror film Les Yeux Sans Visage. Jean-Christophe Grang\u00e9's previous book, The Stone Council, was further evidence of a talent for hybrid new-age thriller and high adventure, inspired by the death of Princess Diana, a trip to Mongolia and too many episodes of The X-Files. The fun of Grang\u00e9, who is batty or inspired depending on your disposition, is that his books are as likely to confront the paranormal as a cold war hangover. </p> <p>The author is French, which perhaps explains why, in a conservative genre, he stands out for a willingness to play with ideas and philosophise. There is a theoretical dimension not found in the Anglo-Saxon strain and he is as interested in the ideas behind the narrative as narrative itself. Grang\u00e9, a former reporter, also runs a news agency and his stories have that same sense of a wide range of information sifted and processed. His narratives have surface confidence, bordering on arrogance, and he is not afraid of appearing clever, as shown in The Stone Council's shoot-out in a gallery of Mondrians. The disadvantages, if the set-up fails to intrigue, are characters too defined by an over-determined narrative, wayward-ness and implausibility. That said, he deserves praise for dispensing with the dreary realism that conditions most thrillers, while playing by the rules, with results that call to mind comic strips and Hitchcock more than John le Carr\u00e9. </p> <p>Empire of the Wolves starts in the vein of Hitchcock's disciple Brian de Palma, with a combination of woman in jeopardy and scientific mystery, executed in the literary equivalent of De Palma's sinuous Steadicam style. Anna Hemes, wife of a senior policeman, suffers terrifying panic attacks and hallucinations. Whoever she thinks she is, she is not that person. Her face has been altered by plastic surgery. She suspects her memory is false too. In other words, she is someone's creation and is forced to investigate herself. </p> <p>At the same time, two Parisian policemen, one honourable and the other extremely bent, investigate the brutal murders of three illegal Turkish women workers, whose torture includes facial disfigurement. They enter a subterranean Parisian world that rivals the atmosphere of Greene's Viennese sewers and confront the dank secrets of France's colonial past and an emergent rightwing Turkish nationalism in the form of the Grey Wolves. This paramilitary organisation was founded as an anti-communist body but now operates in the interface of covert government action and criminal enterprise, carrying out assassinations of Armenian and Kurdish leaders for the secret service and working as debt collectors, racketeers, bodyguards and drug runners for the mafia. (The Grey Wolves were responsible for the attempted assassination of the Pope in 1981.) </p> <p>The hardest thing with this kind of material is getting it to work on the page without appearing too intellectual or slapdash. Grang\u00e9's solution is a combination of driven narrative, colour, breathlessness, quick character sketches, a lot of physical prose (\"the ghastly dampness of her open, slack entrails\"), a fondness for underground locations and art galleries, and moments of puzzlement. All act as effective substitutes for conventional motivation, which Grang\u00e9 is not really about, although he is always interested in psychology. His characters are forced to ask the basic questions in extremis, in the case of Anna, who am I? A recurring theme is the borderlands of identity, personal, geographical and political; the investigations marked by restlessness and high mileage. </p> <p>Here the fundamental question beyond identity concerns moral conduct in an increasingly insecure world, which is most severely tested in the area of counter-intelligence. The corrupt cop, known alternately as the Steel and the Cipher, happily tortured in Algeria in defence of French colonialism and later applied his methods to combating street crime. With the new age of terrorism the threat is upped and measures of defence become even more urgent, down to scientific modification of personality and cerebral make-up. As a senior French official puts it: \"The Americans listen to everything, receive everything, except when it's coming from people who are really dangerous! On the one hand, thirty billion dollars, on the other some plastic knives.\" New technology symbolises the moribund state just as fluidity, anonymity and secrecy are the weapons of the emerging order of terrorism, travelling light and undetected. </p> <p>Grang\u00e9 is quite cheerful about painting everything black. Discovery is rarely for the better, just another projection of a continuing nightmare. Anna finds out she used to be someone she would rather not have been. Neither brutality nor sentiment is a guarantee of anything. Characters who behave as if exempt, and who the reader believes to be, are summarily dispatched. The conventional tacked-on come-uppance is barely a token. </p> <p>While characters talk in broad, expansive gestures, Grang\u00e9 quietly marshals detailed material on scientific funding, the black economy, illegal immigration, drug smuggling, advanced medical research and fanaticism: the stuff of today's (and tomorrow's) news refashioned in a way that alludes to virtual reality, Alpha-ville and Ian Fleming's From Russia With Love. Grang\u00e9 does what thrillers are supposed to do and rarely manage: show a world as it is rather than the illusions by which it is lived.</p>",
  "<p>One of the by-products of looking through archives is a kind of artificial clairvoyance: you know what is going to happen next. Sandwiched between some loose papers in the archives of the British photographer Tony Ray-Jones at the Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television in Bradford was a page from one of those old-fashioned desk calendars, the sort that gets torn off as each day goes by. A large red figure eight and the full date, 7/8/64, Wednesday July 8 1964; the reversed day and month indicated America. On the flip side were a few scribbled notes about how best to expose Pan-X film \"for detail\". Most of the other sheets contained lists, scribbled in swift capitals: \"Some Story Ideas: Sunnyside Colony, Queens (German folk dancing etc), Festival of Flowers (call Buddhist temple), Gypsies and Gypsy weddings, Abyssinian Church Uptown - Fashion show (negro audience), People trapped in small environment - elevators (before door closes), Invisible people - shoe-shiners in Gnd Central, Women who live out of bags, People in Supermarkets - stop them and shoot yell stop. Bus terminals - Make people automatons.\" </p> <p>Among \"some places to photograph\" were Idlewild airport, Fulton fish market on the Lower East Side, East Harlem, Chinatown, St Christopher's Arena \"midgets backstage\", Central Park and Coney Island. It was the hectic schedule of a young British photographer in his first year in New York. The lists aren't dated, but they must have been made before the end of 1963, when Idlewild airport was renamed to commemorate the death of John F Kennedy. By this time Ray-Jones would have been in America for two years, studying for a Master of Fine Arts in graphic design at Yale. After graduating in the summer of 1964, he found a short-lived job as an art director at CBS records, but he was determined to become a photographer. The country he had left behind was still recovering from the second world war, but New York was buzzing with newness. He kept his programme for the US premiere of Stockhausen's Originale in September 1964 at the Judson Hall, with \"action music\" by the artist Nam June Paik and poetry by Allen Ginsberg, just as he kept scraps of paper on which he'd jotted down music stores offering cheap deals on jazz: 50 cents off Horace Silver's Blowin' The Blues Away at Sam Goody's, a dollar off Ray Charles on Atlantic at Korvette's, half-price Blue Note albums at Kenny's. </p> <p>\"You know, Tony loved America intensely, and he loved it for its music,\" Joel Meyerowitz said. \"He was feverish about music and photography. But he was very English about it, always muttering a lot, 'We've got to keep working ...' He was incredibly impatient.\" </p> <p>Meyerowitz is now one of America's most famous photographic artists, but 40 years ago he spent two years of intense friendship with Ray-Jones, roaming the streets and taking photographs. \"Every Saturday there would be ethnic parades, St Patrick's day, Polish day, Columbus day, veterans' day. We used these parades as a laboratory. We learned to be invisible. We learned how to shape pictures that were not about an event but about an observation.\" </p> <p>The streets of New York represented fertile territory for documentary photographers, from Weegee and William Klein to Robert Frank, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand - a new generation of photographers whose aim, in the words of John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art, \"has been not to reform life but to know it\". Ray-Jones and Meyerowitz were fired up by what was going on around them. \"Bresson was very important to both of us,\" Meyerowitz said. \"We were in love with him, and with Robert Frank.\" And then there was Winogrand, who made \"the freest, loosest, open-ended, open-hearted, generous pictures about life\". </p> <p>\"Those were precious years,\" Meyerowitz said. \"Every day was a discovery. It was wonderful having a partner who said, 'We've got to keep working. We can't let this crap that we're producing keep us down.' We loved each other in the way that two guys on the edge of discovery love each other, and we had the raw medium between us.\" Which is why the discovery of the calendar page generated a sudden poignancy. Because with it came the realisation that on July 8 1964, Ray-Jones was a month past his 23rd birthday, burning with plans for the future, and in less than 10 years he would be dead. His photographic career spanned little more than a decade. His five years in America were followed by five more in England, from 1966 to 1971. There was a brief return to America, teaching in San Francisco, before he fell ill and returned to London, where he died of leukaemia in March 1972. \"There's a thing about those people,\" Meyerowitz said, \"those people who have brilliant creative minds and who died at 30. They did it in those 10 years - the clock is running and they're burning their metabolism at a certain rate. There was that sense with Tony.\" </p> <p>Ray-Jones was born in Somerset in 1941. His father, Raymond Ray-Jones, was an engraver whose work was collected in the British Museum and the V&amp;A. He died before Tony was a year old, and his mother with her three sons moved in with her parents and worked as a physiotherapist. Ray-Jones went to school at Christ's Hospital, in West Sussex, then enrolled on a graphic design course at the London School of Printing, where Rolf Brandt, Bill Brandt's brother, encouraged his photography. He left England on a scholarship for Yale in 1961 before \"the 60s\" as we know it had even begun. He came back in 1966 to find London swinging, but the rest of Britain still clearly divided by class and tradition. He left behind only one book, but his role as both inspiration and an irritant to a British photographic community which, as far as he was concerned, was barely conscious, compared with America's, ensured his place in the history of British photography. He inspired the generation that followed him to observe the society around them, as its values shifted under Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>In the summer of 1966 he came across a Country Life book of Old English Customs. The description of traditional rural pastimes excited him and he began to conceive of a book about the English. The last such subjective survey by a photographer had been Bill Brandt's The English At Home, published in 1936. It was time for an update. </p> <p>Back in London that autumn, he met Anna Coates, an art student from St Helens. They moved into a flat in Gloucester Place, where Ray-Jones built a darkroom and, amid visitors from America, including Meyerowitz, Winogrand, the jazz pianist Horace Silver, John Szarkowski, continued to develop his new project. A Day Off - An English Journal, a collection of photographs he took between 1967 and 1970, was published posthumously in 1974. </p> <p>He and Anna bought a VW camper van and started to make weekend trips. \"We drove off to the seaside, or to a festival,\" she said. \"Tony did a lot of research with the English Folklore Society, with various tourist boards, with visitors' information centres at various seaside resorts. He plotted things out. He was quite well organised.\" </p> <p>In 1964, at Yale, Ray-Jones had attended a lecture by Walker Evans, who showed not his own photographs but his collection of American postcards. Ray-Jones now began to collect postcards of England, including the rude seaside postcards by Donald McGill. He made lists of books to read, from The Butlin Story, to Veblen's The Theory Of The Leisure Class, to Jane Austen's unfinished novel, Sanditon. His calendar of upcoming events included women's bowls in Bournemouth in July, Britain's baby of the year in Blackpool in August, Carnival Week in Skegness in September. Almost every resort had a beauty contest. </p> <p>Meyerowitz was impressed by the change in his friend. \"When we met up in London in 1966, he seemed a little more rooted,\" he said. \"To me, Britain had the impoverished mentality of a postwar generation. There was a tightness and a rigidity in the culture. Tony had come back and was able to mock those mores and that lifestyle. It was perfect timing for him to return.\" </p> <p>In the mid-to-late 1960s, England's seaside resorts were filled with families taking their annual holidays. Ray-Jones captured the chaos of these groups - barefoot children wandering off down the sands, pensioners wrapped up in motley against the winds, young couples in awkward embraces, hamfisted fathers with their toddlers, chips and ice-cream and beer and litter, and everything happening at the same time in a choreography that sent the eye wandering off to the farthest edges of the picture and back again. The English seaside in black and white can be a grim place. But in the gestures of the people, Ray-Jones captured a whole range of human emotions; the lascivious tongue licking round the mouth of a spivvy-looking judge at a beauty contest in Southport; the gentle embrace of a young couple on a boat trip around Beachy Head, of which only the photographer among the rest of the holiday-makers on board seems aware; the joyless couple at Great Yarmouth, slumped under grimy fake palm trees, and, in the far left of the picture, the back of an unlit neon sign that reads JOYLAND in reverse. </p> <p>America had been a search: for a style, for a subject, for a means of self-expression that went beyond the neatly crafted magazine photograph. His most successful pictures have this strong, multilayered architecture, built up by the passage of people and events within the frame. There is a tension between control and the lack of it; between the structure of the picture and the chance encounters that undermine it. </p> <p>By 1968 he was ready to show his work to publishers, but London was not prepared. Fashion and advertising photographers were profiting from the \"youthquake\". There were new magazines and new products, particularly for teenagers and women. There were Sunday colour supplements. But most photography books (with the exception of Brandt) came from America. \"No one was putting photographs up on walls and saying 'This is Art', as they were already doing in America,\" Anna Ray-Jones said. \"And I think Tony brought that vision. But I think that was an alien view at the time, apart from a few enlightened people.\" </p> <p>Creative Camera, launched at the beginning of 1968, was dedicated to publishing personal portfolios and critical writing on photography. It was owned by Colin Osman, a photography enthusiast who owned and published Racing Pigeon magazine, and was based in his offices in Doughty Street. It was into this den of pigeon fanciers and photographers that a \"frizzy-haired guy with a Fu Manchu moustache\" walked with a yellow box under his arm and told editor Bill Jay, \"Your magazine's shit, but I can see you're trying. You just don't know enough, so I am here to help you.\" It was Tony Ray-Jones. The box contained pictures from America and for his proposed book. </p> <p>Jay was impressed by the pictures and published some of them in the October issue. He and Ray-Jones became friends and combatants in the battle to raise the British consciousness about photography. Ray-Jones insisted Jay go with him to New York, where he planned to show the dummy of his English book to American publishers. They stayed at the Chelsea Hotel, and Jay met a whole roster of American photographers, including Winogrand, Frank, Meyerowitz and Arbus. But Ray-Jones received little interest in his book. </p> <p>In the spring of 1969, some 54 of his photographs - entitled The English Seen - made up part of a group show of four photographers, Ray-Jones, Enzo Ragazzini, Dorothy Bohm and Don McCullin, at the ICA. It was the first photography exhibition the institute had held. Sue Davies, who two years later founded the Photographers' Gallery in London, was working there at the time. \"Everybody in the ICA thought photography was naff. But after that hundreds of people came. It was so refreshing. Most of the stuff at the ICA had been very esoteric, quite elitist, quite hard. Then other photographers came, asking, 'Can you show my work?' That's really what inspired me to think of starting a place for professional photographers to show their work properly.\" </p> <p>By the time of the ICA show, Ray-Jones had a more subtle understanding of his subject: \"I have tried to show the sadness and the humour in a gentle madness that prevails in a people. The situations are sometimes ambiguous and unreal, and the juxtaposition of elements seemingly unrelated, and yet the people are real. This, I hope, helps to create a feeling of fantasy. Photography can be a mirror and reflect life as it is, but I also think that perhaps it is possible to walk, like Alice, through a Looking Glass, and find another kind of world with the camera.\" </p> <p>In 1970 he was offered a teaching job at the San Francisco Art Institute. He needed \"an American breather\", his wife said, and they left for the west in 1971. He found teaching frustrating, but worked hard on stories for both American and British magazines, and experimented with colour for his own work. \"We had intended to move to Los Angeles because Tony decided he wanted to go into films,\" Anna Ray-Jones explained. \"I don't know what this transition would have really been like, but he decided he would study cinematography, and he was admitted to the Cal-Arts, into the school of cinema there. He became ill at the end of 1971 and it was apparent that something was very wrong. So it put the kibosh on all kinds of plans. And then he had to come home.\" He flew back to London on March 10 1972 and died three days later. </p> <p>Last summer in Arles, Martin Parr, a guest curator of the photography festival there, showed a small group of Ray-Jones prints, a preview of a much larger exhibition that opens, accompanied by a new book, at the Bradford musem later this month. More than any other photographer in the generation that followed Ray-Jones, Parr's work reflects his influence. He first saw Ray-Jones's photographs in 1970, when Bill Jay gave a lecture at Manchester Polytechnic, where Parr was a student. \"His pictures were about England. They had that contrast, that seedy eccentricity, but they showed it in a very subtle way. They have an ambiguity, a visual anarchy. They showed me what was possible.\" </p> <p>The recent history of photography in Britain is still being compiled and argued over. There is no doubt as to Ray-Jones's influence on the development of what came to be called \"independent\" British photography during the 1970s, but the degree of its importance is debated. To Jay, \"He galvanised a lot of young photographers. A myth was created about the 'independent artist'. It was created by people coming out of art colleges, absorbing the aura of the pure artist. You can exaggerate Tony's influence. The fact is that he wasn't there.\" For David Hurn, a Magnum photographer and a friend of Jay and Ray-Jones, the \"myth that has grown up, that Tony brought American photography to Britain [is] nonsense. These people were known about. I had a big flat in Bayswater. By the mid-1960s Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Winogrand, had all been to stay. The idea that photography in Britain wouldn't have happened without Tony is wrong.\" </p> <p>But from an American perspective, Britain lacked an original voice in photography during that period, and Ray-Jones stood out. \"There semed to be no precedent in England for work like that,\" John Szarkowski wrote, in answer to an email. \"Of course everyone in my country knew and revered Brandt, and respected Roger Mayne, but the surprising thing about Ray-Jones was that he had a different idea of what subject matter was possible for serious photography. It did not have to be heroic or poetic in any overt sense: it could be on the surface as tedious or as bland as our real tedious and bland lives usually are, and the photographs might still be compelling.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tony Ray-Jones, by Russell Roberts, is published by Boot at \u00a329.95.
