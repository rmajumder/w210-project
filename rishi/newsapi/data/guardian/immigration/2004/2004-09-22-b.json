  "A major criminal network believed to have been involved in arranging more than 300 sham marriages in Britain has been smashed by the Immigration Service, it emerged yesterday. <p>Officers disrupted a number of weddings at a south-west London register office at the weekend, leading to several arrests. </p> <p>At least four people - including the alleged mastermind of the ring and a bride and groom - have been charged. </p> <p>The scam allegedly involved women from the Netherlands who claim to be working in Britain being flown in to marry west African men, exploiting a loophole in the law which allows foreign nationals to stay in the country if married to an EU citizen working here, without being required to show an intention to live together. </p> <p>It is understood the organisers charged up to \u00a310,000 to arrange the ceremonies, paying the \"brides\" between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000. The men and women were thought to be told enough about each other before the ceremony to convince officials that they were having a relationship. </p> <p>The investigation began after authorities noticed a pattern of women flying on single ticket journeys from the Netherlands. At first they were suspected of being drug mules; further investigation revealed the marriage scam. </p> <p>The alleged ringleader, who was arrested in east London, has been charged with two counts of conspiring to defraud the home secretary, two counts of perjury and one count of bigamy. </p> <p>The suspected groom has been charged with perjury and deception and the bride with perjury and attempting to assist a foreign national break British immigration law. </p> <p>Four more people - three men and a woman - were arrested on Sunday and Monday on suspicion of being involved in immigration offences. </p> <p>According to Mark Rimmer, the director of registrars in the north London borough of Brent, more than 10,000 bogus marriages take place for immigration purposes in Britain each year. He estimated that at least 8,000 were in London - one in five of all weddings in the city. </p> <p>\"But to be honest that is a conservative estimate,\" he said. \"I know of at least one borough where they thought every other marriage was a sham.\" </p> <p>New legislation is about to come into force which will require all foreign nationals to get permission from the Home Office before they can get married. </p> <p>Those from outside the European economic area will have to prove that they are in the country legally, and others entering on a \"fiance\" visa will have to convince officials that the intended marriage is genuine. </p> <p>\"What we do not want to happen before the legislation is enforced is an 'end of season sale' scenario, where we get a large number of scam weddings between now and then,\" Mr Rimmer said. </p> <p>The tell-tale signs of fraudulent marriage include body language and an inability to communicate other than through an interpreter. </p> <p>Couples frequently produce bogus utility bills, bank statements and similar documents, supposedly proving their residence in Britain. The same documents have been seen at different register offices, with the names changed. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: \"These operations are testament to the enormous effort and hard work by the Immigration Service to protect the UK's immigration and marriage laws from abuse by determined criminals.\"</p>",
  "At least 22 people were killed and 150 injured yesterday as two suicide car bombers wrought havoc in Baghdad and US forces pounded suspected insurgents in the east of the capital. <p>The first car bomb attack appeared to be aimed at dozens of men applying to join the Iraqi National Guard. The blast ripped through a photocopy shop packed with men preparing papers for a nearby recruitment centre.</p> <p>Hospital officials said at least 11 were killed, with as many as 54 injured.</p> <p>At least 13 vehicles were wrecked and the engine of the suicide car was hurled 50 metres (150 ft). Reporters described bloodied bodies, shattered glass and debris littering the street. Scores of sandals and shoes lay abandoned on the ground. An ice cream stall was obliterated.</p> <p>\"They just bombed people eating ice cream,\" said Humam Abdul-Hadi, owner of a nearby shop, according to Reuters. Shrapnel wounds peppered his face and neck and his T-shirt was stained with blood.</p> <p>In the second attack, in the upmarket Mansour district, four US soldiers and two civilians were injured when a car bomb was detonated near several US military vehicles, the military said. It later said a US soldier died in one of the car bombing attacks, but did not say which one.</p> <p>Earlier, US aircraft and tanks raked targets in the Sadr City slum, killing at least 10 people and wounding 92. The clashes broke out after units searched for weapons in the Shia stronghold.</p> <p>An Associated Press reporter near the scene said a US C-130 gunship raked one area with fire after rebels loyal to the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr opened fire with rocket propelled grenades.</p> <p>A roadside bomb attack near Saddam Hussein's home town of Tikrit killed one US soldier, the military said. Another soldier died of wounds sustained near Mosul.</p> <p>There were clashes last night in Samarra, where US forces had earlier claimed success against militants. At least one child was killed and five people were wounded in fighting in the city's north-east area.</p> <p>\u0095 Two US soldiers have been charged over the deaths of three Iraqis, the US command said yesterday. \"Sergeant Michael P Williams and Specialist Brent W May ... have been charged with premeditated murder,\" it said. Sgt Williams was also charged with obstruction of justice.</p>",
  "Russia will this week push for a UN resolution calling for the easier extradition of people associated with terrorists, in an attempt to speed the transfer of the Chechen separatist Akhmed Zakayev from London to Moscow, according to a Foreign Office official involved in the case. <p>Mr Zakayev, spokesman for the Chechen separatist leader, Aslan Maskhadov, was granted political asylum in Britain last November. His anti-Russian statements and promotion of the separatist cause have irritated Moscow.</p> <p>Despite a bungled extradition attempt, Moscow has exerted considerable diplomatic and rhetorical pressure on London, and has labelled Mr Zakayev a terrorist. </p> <p>It claims Mr Maskhadov ordered the seizure of the school in Beslan on September 1 and has put a $10m (\u00a35.6m) price on his head. Mr Maskhadov's former military deputy, Shamil Basayev, has since claimed responsibility for the crisis in which at least 329 people died. </p> <p>The FO official said: \"As we understand it, they want a new resolution with a whole range of counter-terrorist measures across the spectrum. One of them will be making it easier to extradite people like Zakayev who have alleged links to terrorism.\" </p> <p>He said Russia would also push for terrorism to be given a legal definition by the UN, seeking to capitalise on a week of international cooperation over terrorism. </p> <p>The move comes as the Russian parliament called on the US and UK to restrict the activities of Chechen separatists living in exile in Washington and London. </p> <p>It will today debate a new bill \"on the fight against terrorism\", which includes proposals for greater restrictions on movement around Russia, the death penalty for terrorist activities and a ban on media coverage of terrorism. </p> <p>The British charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Moscow was hauled in front of the foreign ministry last week over Mr Zakayev's asylum, on which the home secretary, David Blunkett, has the final say. </p> <p>However, the FO official said Moscow had yet to present any new evidence that he was linked to terrorism. \"They are clearly unhappy that he can criticise Russia loudly in the media. I think it is more about political control than any hope that they will get useful information from him,\" he said. </p> <p>Russia's security service, the FSB, has said it believes Mr Zakayev is being allowed to stay in London because he is useful to British intelligence. An FSB official said last week: \"Why do [the British government and special services] need him and consider him important? He doesn't represent anything himself, and there's no one behind him. Maybe he's helpful if they want to criticise Russia. I can't see another motive.\"</p>",

  "<p>It's hard to imagine the joy and pleasure that having a donkey in your garden can give to a small boy. In truth, he was a rather raggedy, slightly flea-bitten thing (the four-legged fellow, I mean) but he was amiable, eager for attention and, to a 14-month-old, he was a purebred white Arabian stallion. He is a boy of few words (well, two actually - \"dof\" and, we know not why, \"bugger\"), but they and, his burgeoning pointing skills, were employed to full effect every time Monsieur Donkey emerged from the shade of the trees to blink in the warm French sunshine and in the adoration of a little chap.</p> <p>But you couldn't really blame the poor child for being so impressed - somehow everything seems better in the light of a sunny French afternoon. Lie back on an empty French beach or in the garden of your homely gite, only \"dof!\" and \"bugger!\" punctuating the peace, and all is very much right with the world. </p> <p>In truth, if you follow our lead, it won't begin like that. Most family holidays involve some level of compromise and ours was the fact that we chose to start with the ferry from Portsmouth. The ferry can be very pleasant. Portsmouth cannot. A couple of hours looking for something that didn't involve strong lager and Sky TV and we were longing to begin the unfathomable process of loading up the ferry - the selection procedure for who actually gets on the ferry nice and early and who waits for hours listening to a CD of children's songs is a mystery to the finest minds - but the voyage itself can be a very pleasant way to drink a few drinks, shop a bit and eat some fairly palatable nosh, while listening to enthusiastic musicians. </p> <p>If you take a nipper and you journey overnight, in the name of all that's holy, double check your cabin. On the way back the cabin was spacious enough to squeeze in a travel cot. On the way out it wasn't so we had to use the one the boat provides. They are not cots. They are laundry baskets. Small ones. No one will sleep. A wink.</p> <p>But even a bleary-eyed emergence into St Malo is a great pleasure. Ferry ports can make lovely towns after all, the city walls and yacht-stuffed marina give off an air of welcome and a sense of the obliging that actually comes as something of a shock. But you can potter round the cobbled streets, munch your galettes and sit in any number of the little bars and bistros of St Malo on your way back. For now, we're heading off to Huelgoat.</p> <p>We were actually staying in the tiny hamlet of Coat Mocun, just outside the small market town of Huelgoat, both to be found in the centre of Brittany in among the farms and forests of an area characterised as the Parc D'Amorique. Lush and picturesque and half asleep, much of the area had decreed that the holiday season was over (in the first week of September). </p> <p>The roads were quiet - or at least you were more likely to be stuck behind a walnut-faced local farmer driving a tractor than a ruddy-faced Brit towing a caravan - the shops were retreating into eccentric opening hours and my halting (almost reversing) French was greeted with cheery surprise rather than weary resignation. And it was fabulous. In these days of unpredictable weather, the end of the holiday season is as likely to be hot as the middle (and was), so the sense of sneaking yourself a secret treat in the empty streets of Brittany's small towns adds a layer of smug satisfaction to a trip.</p> <p>The gite was spacious, well-equipped (if you don't mind pre-loved kitchen utensils) and had been taking guests since 1955 so pretty much everything had been catered for. Even according to the guest book, down to providing a sensational selection of moths. We saw none worthy of note, but one enthusiast listed his top twenty sightings. A guest book can be an uncomfortable peek into the minds of others. But comfy as we were, moths or no, the beaches were calling.</p> <p>The west coast can be simply breathtaking. Camarat, Pentrez and Douarmenez can all treat you to impressive open spaces of white sand and the rolling Atlantic. It could have been the eccentricities of the holiday season, but the beaches were almost empty, pockmarked with French and English families, patiently filling and emptying buckets for their smaller members or watching as the more adventurous offspring headed off to sea or to the rock-pools to do battle with spume and crabs. </p> <p>If you want old-fashioned family values, here they are. The innocent pleasures of fresh air, collecting pebbles, pulling seaweed from your toes and slurping ice cream are here in all their refreshing glory. Long days watching footballs gather speed as they head towards the tides end with the rhythm of shoes battered against the footwells of cars, the little piles of loosened sand in the vacated car parks testaments to the sort of days your parents relished.</p> <p>The favourite, though, was Port Manech on the southern coast of Brittany. A tiny strip of beach, strewn with seaweed, it looked less promising at first, but the shelter the bay provides, the backdrop of a fairytale village and forest perched on rocky promontories and the warm sea lapping the toes soon wins you over. That bucket and spade got some hammer that day.</p> <p>As you swoop onto Port Manech, you cannot ignore the splendid Concarneau, another walled city, another port, but you can't fail to be impressed by the seafood restaurants (and admittedly, tacky souvenir shops) that inhabit the cobbled streets that form part of the old fortifications. Even at our end of the season, hordes of tourists parade up and down with a strange solemnity peering at menus, examining pottery. Tourism is, its seems, something to be taken seriously.</p> <p>But heading north again, back to the heart of the region lies Trevarez Castle, a place of enormous stupidity. Not only is it a splendidly ludicrous early 20th century Gothic folly of such malevolence and gloom that you expect Scooby Doo and Shaggy to pass quivering by, but that foolishness was compounded by the housing there, in the second world war, of Japanese and German submariners, a good 30 miles from the sea and in the most glaring target the bombers could see for miles. Inside the castle, a video constantly loops a Sino-German sports day, interrupted by some very serious bombing.</p> <p>Each day of a family holiday is the choice between the beach (for the nipper) and the restaurants, towns and castles for the parents. Next year we'll start to lose a few more of those arguments (we already lost some and he can't even speak). But for now, the biggest defeat for us was the unfathomable thought processes of French road signs (are they still trying to thwart Nazi invasion?) and the ineffable sadness that is saying \"bugger\" and waving goodbye to a donkey.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong> </p> <p>Jimmy travelled with Brittan Ferries from Portsmouth to St Malo. Price for two adults and two children (with standard vehicle) staying at the gite Coat Mocun, Huelgoat (ref: QB2149) is \u00a3440 (\u00a3236 for the crossing, \u00a3204 for the gite).

  "<p>No star of the last 10 years has been such a magnet for the neuroses and prejudices of those who watch her than Paltrow. Camille Paglia, writing here, referred to her as \"vacuous, sallow, moony, rubbernecked\" and, noting that she is the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and late producer/director Bruce Paltrow, called her \"a preening, pampered princess who's been foisted on the public by a bicoastal media cabal.\" Tara Ariano and Sarah D. Bunting worked a similar, familiar theme on MSNBC, writing: \"Even before she won her Oscar, Gwyneth Paltrow was Hollywood royalty -- the child of a lovely patrician actress and a producer of interesting, critically praised TV shows. But she hasn't just lazed about, drawing on her trust fund of fame: she's made a name for herself by dating her co-stars; dressing so well that she's considered a fashion icon; talking about her trendy hobbies, from yoga to her macrobiotic diet to 'cupping'; and now for marrying a rock star, giving birth to their child, and naming her after produce. Oh, and she hasn't made a good movie since 'Shakespeare in Love.'\"</p> <p>People seem to hate Paltrow because she's got that slightly aloof patrician beauty, because her career benefited from the connections she had growing up the daughter of Blythe Danner and Bruce Paltrow, because family friend Steven Spielberg helped her get into the movies, because her dad bought her the Harry Winston necklace she wore to the Oscars, because she burst into tears accepting the award, because she married rock star Chris Martin of Coldplay, because she named their daughter Apple. And this history isn't even checkered by a broken home or a stint in rehab to console Paltrow haters, darn it.</p> <p>It's understandable that Paltrow pushes the buttons of people who didn't have the advantages she did, who think of how hard they've had to work for what they've gotten and resent how easily success has come to her. Those are very real, very strong, very persistent feelings. They're also part of the slop we have to put aside if we want to call ourselves grown-ups. Nobody should like the fact that life isn't fair -- but being shocked by it past, say, your sophomore year in college seems naive.</p> <p>It's childish to rail against the fact that people's connections help them (the exception being the current occupant of the White House). There wasn't one person I heard making fun of Paltrow for bursting into tears accepting her Oscar who didn't sound offensively inhuman. Here was a young woman overwhelmed at the tail end of an emotional roller coaster (her father and grandfather had been seriously ill). You just know that had she remained composed those same people would have accused her of being an unemotional ice princess who acted like the Oscar was her due. And when people talked about her father having bought her the Harry Winston necklace she wore to the ceremony, as if wanting it or owning it were a moral failing, it sounded like nothing so much as a childish temper tantrum.</p> <p>What may be most interesting about the Paltrow haters is this: Ask any one of them why they hate her and it's almost a sure bet that the quality of her acting will barely figure into it. Maybe they have to avoid the question because, in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, there's not a list of successful big-budget garbage for them to glom onto. Paltrow has kept largely to small- to medium-budget \"specialty\" films. The new \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" is the first thing Paltrow has done that belongs in the blockbuster league, and even it is an odd duck among blockbusters. Composed almost entirely of computer-generated effects (there are only actors and props -- no sets), \"Sky Captain,\" by first-time writer-director Kerry Conran, plays like what you'd get from a kid who shoots Super 8 movies in his backyard and has been given $70 million to do what he wants. But like every other element of the movie, the actors, including Paltrow, exist only to fulfill some iconic function and are part of an enormous, sustained conception that sits on the screen without ever coming alive.</p> <p>Like most people, I first saw Gwyneth Paltrow in Steve Kloves' film \"Flesh and Bone,\" where she played a young con artist whose specialty is sneaking into wakes and, with the aid of Vaseline, stealing the rings off the fingers of corpses. Her whole affect in the picture was so fuck-you blas\u00e9, so unabashedly nasty, that she won me over right away.</p> <p>The trouble was, that same blas\u00e9 affect defined her other work from the period. In the early '90s, just before her movie career broke, I saw her onstage as Nina in a Williamstown Theater Festival production of \"The Seagull,\" co-starring with her mother and Christopher Walken. It wasn't a good performance. Wan and resigned where Nina is tormented and lyric, Paltrow moped through the role, her flat, nasal voice finding none of the pathos or sad comedy of Chekhov's lines.</p> <p>Paltrow has sometimes put her zonked, bruised quality to startling use, as in the role of the Vegas cocktail waitress/hooker in Paul Thomas Anderson's terrific \"Hard Eight\" (still too little seen and still Anderson's best movie). But other times she just seemed dissociated from the pictures she was in, a promising actress who needed some training to refine her potential (and especially to bring some variety to her voice). The stardom that followed, to say nothing of the Oscar, stymied that.</p> <p>If Paltrow is only sometimes the actress she can be, she is also, more often than not, a delightful screen presence. Movies like \"Emma\" (in which she seemed wholly inauthentic) and last year's \"Sylvia\" (as well as perhaps the upcoming screen version of David Auburn's play \"Proof,\" which Paltrow played onstage in London) are her prestige outings. She's much more enjoyable in throwaway pictures. My colleague Stephanie Zacharek described what a fetching clotheshorse Paltrow made in the tepid \"A Perfect Murder.\" In the wrinkle-in-time romantic fantasy \"Sliding Doors,\" Paltrow got to mix charm with coolly cutting sarcasm. Playing an Englishwoman, Paltrow went believably from withering indignation to clipped vulnerability to a sort of dry coquetry, and she matched up very well with John Hannah, whose slight frame complimented hers. And Paltrow's charm lent a sweetness to last year's \"View From the Top,\" in which she played a small-town girl who dreams of becoming a stewardess. The picture was a trifle but, like Mike Nichols' \"Working Girl,\" it was about the weird intersection of blue-collar and white-collar jobs, and it didn't condescend to the people in those jobs or to their dreams. Silly comedies, though, are often treated as if they're beneath contempt. Which is certainly how Paltrow speaks of it in a recent Entertainment Weekly interview.</p> <p>That interview reveals one unattractive movie-star habit -- that of distancing yourself from your failures. \"If you go back and look at interviews,\" she says, \"you'll never, you'll maybe twice hear me saying I genuinely love a film, because I don't lie.\" Forget that sometimes telling a lie is simply a matter of being gracious to the people you work with. Paltrow's priding herself on her honesty suggests that she's not the best judge of her work because, with the exception of \"Shakespeare in Love,\" in which she deserved every bit of praise she got, her best work has been done in movies that were either critical or commercial failures or both. Maybe the acclaim for \"Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\" and \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" will prompt a reappraisal of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Great Expectations,\" which was greeted as a travesty when it opened in 1997. (In a Premiere magazine profile at the time, Paltrow suggested that Cuar\u00f3n had lost control of the production.) It's a rapturous updating of the Dickens novel that has its dedicated admirers; the discerning British film critic Robin Wood has called it a model for how film adaptations can be true to the spirit of their sources while being wholly original creations. Paltrow plays Estella, the young beauty raised by her guardian Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on the male sex. Ethan Hawke is the young artist whose bloodstream Estella enters when they are just children. It's a tough role, that of a beauty whose surface radiance has no inner correspondence. As the critic Steve Vineberg put it at the time, Paltrow has to play \"the sadness of a woman with no emotions,\" and she's remarkable. The infernally beautiful young Jean Simmons was memorable as the younger Estella in David Lean's famous 1946 film of the novel. (Valerie Hobson, who played the grown Estella, is memorable too, but for all the wrong reasons -- she's a colossal comedown after Simmons.) Put it this way, Simmons is as good as Paltrow, but she isn't any better.</p> <p>It was another literary adaptation, Neil LaBute's 2002 film of A.S. Byatt's \"Possession,\" that provided Paltrow with one of her best roles. Like \"Great Expectations,\" \"Possession\" was held up as an example of how movies are hopelessly inadequate for conveying the complexity and richness of novels. In some ways, LaBute seems to understand the material better than Byatt did. He made a fleet, sharp adaptation that focused on the parallel love stories Byatt had devised. LaBute's film is a civilized entertainment entirely free of the reverence and stuffiness that clogs up too many period films. As the female, British half of a pair of academics chasing down the hidden love affair between two Victorian poets, Paltrow put both her coolness and the propriety of her self-presentation to comic, and at times melancholic, effect. What's touching about the performance is the reticence that remains in Paltrow as her icy exterior starts to melt. It's her most stylized, and stylish, performance.</p> <p>Paltrow's fine-boned beauty makes her appear almost a stylized creature at times, more a moonbeam than a sunbeam. And that may be why she has often been at her most affecting in comedies or love stories, which are stylized forms. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut once wrote about how, because of the surrounding idealized perfection, sad moments in musicals can be especially wounding.</p> <p>That's the principle at work in the Farrelly brothers' \"Shallow Hal,\" which features Paltrow's most affecting performance -- certainly her sunniest and most relaxed. The movie's message is childishly simple -- beauty is only skin deep. But conviction and emotion can make even the most banal concepts feel rich, and \"Shallow Hal\" is one of the loveliest, most affecting, and most emotionally satisfying of American film comedies. Paltrow plays Rosemary, a girl whose obesity keeps people from seeing what a beautiful person she is -- except for Jack Black's Hal, who is under a spell that lets him see only a person's inner beauty. So Hal sees Rosemary as a slim, beautiful girl; the \"real\" Rosemary is Paltrow in a fat suit.</p> <p>\"Shallow Hal\" provoked exactly the kind of outrage you'd expect. In Slate, David Edelstein said of Paltrow's performance and her detractors, \"she takes many more chances here, and she won't get an Oscar -- just grief from liberals and organizations that claim to speak for the overweight.\" Some women claimed that the movie was saying it was OK to love a fat girl as long as she was really Gwyneth Paltrow. The trouble is that nothing in the movie supports that reading. In the Farrellys' conception, inner beauty cuts both ways. The real proof of what the movie is saying comes when Jack's spell is lifted. From then on, the only Rosemary anyone sees is Rosemary as she actually appears, and that's the woman Jack has to learn to love -- not the svelte blond beauty his spell allowed him to see. That girl is, quite literally, a fantasy creature.</p> <p>As Rosemary, Paltrow expresses emotion that has the force of the elemental. The hurt on her face when Jack, under his spell, chides her, saying that she must have to fend off the guys, is exceeded only by the hurt she expresses when she realizes he has (momentarily, in the movie's scheme) rejected her because of who she really is. Paltrow lets us see a young woman learning to be comfortable with who she really is and then, cruelly, made to feel a freak inside her body. There's no distance between what Rosemary feels and what Paltrow makes us feel.</p> <p>\"Shallow Hal\" and last year's underrated \"Stuck on You\" reveal that the Farrelly brothers may be less interested in sophomoric humor than in recasting themselves as the radical humanists of American film comedy. These are deeply inclusionary movies, in which ugliness as well as beauty are only skin deep. In \"Shallow Hal,\" Paltrow is right on their wavelength. The directors had a comically irresistible idea -- to take the golden princess of American movies and put her in a fat suit. The movie erases the distance between Paltrow and the audience, not because she is pulled off her pedestal and humiliated, but because it allows us to see her wounded by emotions that most of us assume would be alien to Gwyneth Paltrow. That's another example of how the Farrellys make hash of our assumptions. Of course \"Shallow Hal\" is red meat to Paltrow haters, because it says judgments based on surfaces arebthe ugliest thing imaginable. A simple idea her most fervent detractors have yet to grasp.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Charles Taylor is a Salon staff writer.</p>",
  "<p>The interim president of Haiti, President Boniface Alexandre, yesterday appealed to world leaders for aid as the death toll from the country's second flooding disaster in four months reached more than 700. </p> <p>Mr Alexandre made his plea at the UN in New York after the tropical storm Jeanne inundated many cities at the weekend and mudslides buried houses.</p> <p>\"In the face of this tragedy, I appeal urgently for the solidarity of the international community,\" Mr Alexandre said. The US government pledged an immediate $60,000 (\u00a333,500) in aid.</p> <p>The worst damage was in the north-western coastal city of Gonaives, where at least 550 people died when a three- metre wall of water and mud destroyed large areas of the town. More than 100 other people died in the region.</p> <p>Last night the disaster was blamed on deforestation, which has left communities vulnerable to flash floods.</p> <p>\"Deforestation is a huge factor in this disaster,\" said Luis Clemens, Caribbean spokesman for Oxfam, speaking from Mexico City.</p> <p>\"It means that you have mudslides and roads washed away and what would be a tropical storm elsewhere has hurricane effects in Haiti.\"</p> <p>The mountainous country which was once heavily forested now has less than 2% tree cover. This has led to se vere soil erosion which allows water to rush off the steep slopes.</p> <p>Most trees have been cut down to make charcoal for cooking. A recent UN environmental report described Haiti as \"one of the most degraded countries in the world.\"</p> <p>Last night UN peacekeeping forces joined local rescue efforts, helping to recover hundreds of bodies. \"There's not one house in Gonaives that has not been affected,\" said the interim prime minister, Gerard Latortue, touring flooded areas. He declared the city of 250,000 people a disaster area and also appealed for international aid.</p> <p>\"We expect to find dozens more bodies as the flood waters recede,\" said Dieufort Deslorges, a spokesman for the government's civil protection agency. He said more than 100,000 people in Gonaives needed shelter, food or medical aid.</p> <p>The first emergency supplies reached the city yesterday but the three Red Cross trucks carrying food and blankets were immediately besieged by people.</p> <p>The tropical storm came four months after devastating flash floods along the southern border of Haiti and the neighbouring Dominican Republic killed at least 2,500 people.</p> <p>Haiti's poverty also contributed significantly to the disaster, said Oxfam. \"It means that people are extremely vulnerable. They have no significant capacity to respond to emergencies and there's no civil defence system. The cities have no drains or any way of storing the floodwater,\" said Mr Clemens.</p> <p>With soil in some areas eroded beyond repair, the government has been looking into relocating communities, particularly from flood-prone zones. After the floods in May, reforesting the country was declared a priority.</p> <p>\"Every time there's a flood, it's always the same victims,\" Mr Alexandre said in June. \"We need to find a better place for them, and if the appropriate land is privately owned, the government must expropriate it.\"</p> <p>The US promised aid to help build water catchment areas and to plant more trees, but restoring Haiti's ecology is a massive task.</p> <p>In the past 20 years, more than 60m trees have been planted to try to avoid soil erosion and desertification, but an estimated 10-20m are cut down each year for firewood and charcoal.</p> <p>The foreign minister of the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, also called for international assistance to help relief efforts in his country, where at least 11 people died in the same storm.</p>",
  "Michael Howard will today try to capitalise on public disquiet over the rise in immigration by proposing an annual quota for the number of migrants and asylum seekers allowed into Britain. <p>The Conservative leader will also set out plans for an Australian-style points-based system for deciding which applicants will be entitled to enter the country, with a strong bias towards skilled, qualified professionals with English language competency.</p> <p>A recent commission on immigration set up by the Tories had proposed that only those capable of earning more than \u00a326,000 a year be admitted.</p> <p>Conservative sources insisted that the points system would not act as a backdoor way of keeping out all unskilled workers, or the rural poor seeking asylum.</p> <p>Mr Howard will also confirm that he will abolish the presumption that anyone living in Britain on a work permit for more than four years will be entitled to stay permanently.</p> <p>He is also likely to restrict the right of children to sponsor their parents entering the country, saying the parents may only enter if they have more children living in Britain than any other country.</p> <p>The Conservative chairman, Liam Fox, was recently disclosed as saying that a strong anti-immigration line was the best way of regaining supporters who have defected to the UK Independence party.</p> <p>Mr Howard will say that \"everything I have I owe to this country. My family came here with very little and made a life for themselves. I want others to benefit from the opportunities I had. Immigration is good for Britain.\"</p> <p>But he will insist: \"We cannot allow unlimited immigration indefinitely. Immigration needs to be controlled and it needs to be fair.\"</p> <p>Mr Howard will not say at what level the annual limit should be set, but he will point out that Labour has almost quadrupled the number of work permits issued each year, from 40,000 to 175,000. He will argue that the number of asylum applications has fallen largely because many are now making backdoor applications as migrants.</p> <p>Mr Howard said parliament would set the quota annually based on an assessment of Britain's economic needs, the demands of family reunion and the obligation to give refuge to those fleeing persecution.</p> <p>One difficulty with a fixed quota is that the ceiling may need to broken if there is a sudden outbreak of instability in a country, leading to a rush of asylum applications.</p> <p>Labour has repeatedly refused to set limits on the number of people coming into Britain because of concerns about housing shortages and hard-pressed public services.</p> <p>The industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, has pointed out that there are around 250,000 job vacancies in Britain and what concerned people were illegal immigration and abuses of the asylum system, not people coming to work legally and contribute.</p> <p>A total of 139,675 people settled in Britain in 2003, compared with 59,000 when Labour came to power in 1997. Almost half were given settlement for family reasons.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, has accused Labour of \"losing their grip\" on the immigration system, saying that between 1994 and 1997 inward migration rose by 4%, while between 1997 and 2002, the numbers rose by 57.3%.</p> <p>Des Browne, Labour's minister for citizenship, immigration and nationality, said: \"I hope whatever Michael Howard has to say on asylum and immigration will be better than he managed when he was home secretary. After four years in the job it took 20 months just for an initial decision for an asylum seeker, there was a backlog of 50,000, just 3,000 people a year were removed and he failed to get agreement to go ahead with ID cards.\"</p>",
  "Immigration officials have arrested the suspected ringleader of a gang behind what they believe was the UK's biggest sham marriage racket, it emerged today. <p>Wedding ceremonies at Wandsworth register office, south-west London, were this weekend interrupted by immigration officers, leading to the arrest of the suspected ringleader and a couple taking part in a wedding. </p> <p>The gang is believed to have arranged up to 300 ceremonies, charging would-be husbands \u00a310,000 to find a bride who could enable them to stay in the UK.</p> <p>\"We can confirm that, following reports from intelligence sources, the immigration service disrupted a number of weddings at a register office in south-west London this weekend,\" a Home Office spokesman said.</p> <p>\"As a result of this enforcement action, a man believed to have been involved in the facilitation of numerous sham marriages in the UK was arrested by the immigration service at an address in east London on Saturday.</p> <p>\"Subsequent action in London and the surrounding area on Sunday and Monday led to the arrest of a further four individuals in connection with taking part in, or the facilitation of, suspect marriages. Inquiries are ongoing and we cannot comment further at this stage,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>The scam is understood to have involved flying women from the Netherlands - who claimed to be working in the UK - into Britain to marry west African men. The women were paid between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000 to take part in the marriages. </p> <p>Foreign nationals who are married to EU citizens working in the UK are currently entitled to remain here without showing an intention to live together.</p> <p>Immigration officials became suspicious after noticing a pattern of women flying on single airline tickets from the Netherlands. They initially believed the women were drugs mules, but further investigations unearthed the marriage scam.</p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, today welcomed the arrests. \"These operations are testament to the enormous effort and hard work by the immigration service to protect the UK's immigration and marriage laws from abuse by determined criminals,\" he said.</p> <p>With the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, today calling for a limit to be set on immigration, the Home Office said it remained determined to protect the UK's immigration system and marriage laws from abuse. </p> <p>A spokesman said the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004, to be implemented this week, contained new measures designed to combat suspicious marriages.</p> <p>\"The legislation will require non-European economic area foreign nationals who wish to marry to produce a certificate of approval or proof of entry clearance as a spouse or marriage tourist, and give notice of intended marriage at a designated register office,\" he said.</p> <p>The immigration service is already working alongside registrars to target sham marriages. </p> <p>Home Office officials are to explore the possibility of giving registrars the power to refuse to carry out a marriage they suspect is being carried out for the purposes of illegal immigration, or with the use of false documents.</p>",
  "People today are more cynical about politicians and politics than they have ever been before. Look at any opinion poll and you'll see that we are right down there with estate agents and journalists in the public's eyes. <p>But that is hardly surprising because too many politicians have made too many promises over the last few years which they have failed to keep. </p> <p>Take tax, for example. People have been misled on tax for over a decade. In 1992 we promised to cut taxes and then we put them up. In 1997 Labour said that they would not increase taxes at all and then they raised them 66 times - the equivalent of sixteen and a half pence on income tax.</p> <p>So many people think politicians' pledges aren't worth the paper they're written on. </p> <p>Regaining that trust will be very hard indeed - I am under no illusion about that. </p> <p>We need to start from first principles, setting out clearly what we believe in. </p> <p>We need to be honest about the challenges Britain faces. If something is true but tough, we must not shrink from saying it.</p> <p>And we need to tell the truth about exactly how much we can deliver. Politicians do not have the answer to every problem and we should stop pretending that we do. If something cannot be done, we must level with the public. </p> <p>Rigorous honesty; measured criticism; realistic alternatives - that is the way to renew people's trust in politics. </p> <p>I want people to have the freedom to get on with their lives and get on in life, safe in the knowledge that government will provide them with proper security. </p> <p>That is why I am a Conservative: freedom and security, the two timeless Conservative ambitions.</p> <p><b>The Challenges Britain Faces</b><br></p> <p>Britain today faces real challenges. </p> <p>People are paying too much tax, and they're not getting value for money. High taxes, bloated government and ever increasing regulation are undermining the long term competitiveness of the British economy. </p> <p>Crime is out of control. It's like a shadow across our country. We need more discipline and more respect. People need to know that if they commit crime they will be punished.</p> <p>The Government has tried to improve our schools. Money has been thrown at the problem, but it's been wasted on bureaucracy. One in three 11 year olds cannot write properly. What hope do they have for the future? </p> <p>Billions of pounds have been spent on the NHS, but it's been wasted on bureaucracy. There are still a million people waiting for treatment in Britain - many of them old and frail. People deserve better than that in their old age.</p> <p>And we have lost control of our asylum and immigration system. At a time when Britain faces an unprecedented terrorist threat, we appear to have little idea who is coming into or leaving our country. </p> <p><b>Action, Not Talk</b><br></p> <p>People are tired of talk. They want action - action on schools, on crime, on the NHS, on value for money for taxpayers and on immigration. </p> <p>When I was Home Secretary, crime fell by almost 20 per cent in four years. </p> <p>So I do know how to get a job done. You have to be clear about what it is you want to achieve. You have to follow through what you start. And you have to focus relentlessly on the detail.</p> <p>In the months ahead the Conservatives will set out, simply and clearly, exactly what we want to achieve and how we will get the job done. On each issue, we will be honest about the challenge we face and about what we can do to solve it. Conservatives will not make promises they cannot keep. </p> <p>Today I want to address asylum and immigration, issues I first raised in Burnley last February. </p> <p>Immigration is not an easy subject for politicians to debate. It raises strong emotions. I know. When I was Home Secretary and took action to get to grips with immigration, I was condemned by some commentators as being a traitor to my immigrant roots. They seemed to believe that British people from immigrant families could have no possible interest in wanting to see immigration controlled. </p> <p>I've lost count of the times I have been told by British people from ethnic community backgrounds that firm immigration controls are essential for good race relations.</p> <p>Doubtless I will be condemned again tomorrow. And doubtless my opponents will claim that my speech today is a \"lurch to the right\". </p> <p>But immigration and asylum are not side issues. They are a cause for concern across the world. Australia, Ireland, Denmark, America, India and Canada have all taken steps to address the problem. And it is a cause for concern right across Britain - irrespective of people's background, skin colour or religion. </p> <p>People know that Britain's immigration and asylum system has broken down. They know that it is chaotic, unfair and out of control. They want politicians to be honest about the problem. And they want clear, fair and practical action to tackle it.</p> <p><b>Benefits of Immigration </b><br></p> <p>For centuries Britain has welcomed people from around the world with open arms. We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to those fleeing persecution. And we have always offered a home to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our society. My father was one of them. </p> <p>Migration in both directions is part of a dynamic economy. Our industries and businesses depend upon skilled labour and expertise which can often be found abroad. Britain has benefited from immigration - both economically and culturally. We are a stronger, more successful country because of the immigrant communities that have settled here. </p> <p>Many of them came to Britain with almost nothing and had to start again from scratch. But hard work, determination and a willingness to integrate propelled them forward. They are a credit to our community. </p> <p>Britain has an enviable record of racial integration. Over the years hundreds of immigrant communities have successfully integrated into British society. They have rightly held on to their traditions and culture, while also embracing Britain's and playing their full role in our national life. </p> <p>But any system of immigration must be properly controlled. Firm but fair immigration controls are essential for good race relations, the maintenance of national security and the management of public services. Britain is a densely populated and prosperous country. There are, literally, millions of people in other, poorer, countries who would like to settle here if they could. Britain cannot take them all. So the scale of immigration is important.</p> <p><b>Immigration in Britain Today</b><br></p> <p>Sadly, Britain's immigration controls today are neither firm nor fair. They are chaotic and they are out of control.</p> <p>Consider these facts. Only one out of every five failed asylum seekers is ever removed from the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Government officials have given work permits to people when they knew that their applications were fraudulent. </p> <p>David Blunkett has said that he sees \"no obvious upper limit to legal immigration\". Net immigration to Britain has averaged 158,000 people a year for the last five years. </p> <p>According to the Government's own predictions, Britain's population will grow by 5.6 million people over the next thirty years - equivalent to five times the population of Birmingham. Immigration will account for 85 per cent of that increase. </p> <p>Population increases of this kind do have important public policy implications, which no responsible political party could - or should - ignore. Take housing, for example. The majority of immigrants settle in London and the South East, where pressures on housing are most pronounced. </p> <p>John Prescott plans to build an extra 3.8 million homes in England over the next twenty years - 700,000 of them (that is 18 per cent) are due to net immigration. </p> <p>But Prescott's projections are based on net annual immigration of 65,000 a year. Net annual immigration today is more than double that - at 158,000 a year. On that basis we will need an additional 4.85 million homes - a million more than the Government is planning for. </p> <p>As the Government's own Community Cohesion Panel argued in July, large scale population increases have an impact on the demand for public services and community relations. </p> <p>Let me quote from that the report. \"... There are\", it said \"concerns about the speed at which newcomers can be accommodated. Housing, education, health and other services all take time to expand\".</p> <p>The Panel went on to add - and I quote - \"But people also take time to adjust. The identity of the host community will be challenged and they need sufficient time to come to terms with and accommodate incoming groups, regardless of their ethnic origin. The 'pace of change' (for a variety of reasons) is simply too great in such areas at present\".</p> <p>David Blunkett may believe that there is \"no obvious upper limit to legal immigration\". I do not agree. While migration in both directions is part of a competitive and dynamic modern economy, immigration to Britain cannot continue at its present, uncontrolled levels. </p> <p><b>A New Approach</b><br></p> <p>Britain has reached a turning point. As a country we need a totally new approach to immigration and asylum. We need a system that helps genuine refugees and gives priority to those who want to come to Britain, work hard and make a positive contribution. </p> <p><b>Illegal Immigration</b><br></p> <p>We will start by cracking down hard on illegal immigration. It is quite wrong that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are living in Britain. </p> <p>Some arrive undetected. Others come here legally as students, visitors or on a work permit but stay on illegally. Many are failed asylum seekers who have not been deported. There are now over 250,000 failed asylum seekers living in Britain who have no right to be here. </p> <p>Illegal immigration can be very dangerous. It often involves a long journey, concealed in a truck with little food, water or ventilation. People die in the process. But sadly for many it seems to be a risk worth taking. </p> <p>When illegal immigrants arrive in Britain, they often end up living in very poor conditions, working in dangerous situations on very low earnings well below the minimum wage. The tragedy at Morecambe Bay earlier this year was a stark reminder of just how bad and how dangerous illegal immigrants' working conditions can be. </p> <p>Now I am happy to admit that I made mistakes in government. We all do. And one of them was to lift the checks for passengers leaving the UK for the European Union. My mistaken decision was at least limited in its effect. But Jack Straw compounded the problem by scrapping all embarkation controls in March 1998.</p> <p>If immigration officials don't check people as they come into and out of the country (as they do in America, Australia and Canada), then they can't do anything about those who fail to leave after their work permit or student visa has expired. According to a National Audit Office report into UK Visas, a tracking exercise carried out in Accra found that 37 per cent of a sample of students issued with a visa could not subsequently be traced. </p> <p>A Conservative Government would re-introduce embarkation controls, as the first step in a package of measures to clamp down on illegal immigration. And we will take tough action against companies who employ people illegally. In the last three years there have been just 17 prosecutions and six convictions for employing illegal immigrants. After the tragedy of Morecambe Bay this should be a priority.</p> <p><b>Legal Immigration</b><br></p> <p>We will also take firm but reasonable action to bring legal forms of immigration under control. </p> <p>Without any consultation whatsoever, Labour have presided over a massive increase in immigration. It has more than doubled since they came to power.</p> <p>Labour's justification for this unprecedented increase - in as much as they have given one - has been largely economic. </p> <p><b>The Economics of Immigration</b><br></p> <p>As I have already said, of course economies benefit from immigration. But it is all a question of scale. </p> <p>Tony Blair argues that Britain's economic growth rate \"would be some 0.5 per cent lower over the next two years if net immigration were to cease\". </p> <p>The actual figure is 0.4 per cent . But what the Prime Minister failed to mention was that because the population will have increased by a quarter of a per cent in that time, the benefit per head is negligible. </p> <p>In the United States a 1997 study by the National Research Council found that immigration added just a tenth of one per cent to income per head each year. </p> <p>In any case, the pool of labour available to British employers has increased dramatically because of EU enlargement. The ten new members of the EU have a combined population of roughly 70 million. The Irish Government has recognised this fact - drastically reducing the number of work permits issued to people from outside the EU. </p> <p>Others have argued that we need immigration to fill the 500,000 job vacancies here in Britain. But there are currently 1.46 million people unemployed in our country today and over two million people who are economically inactive - people the Government wishes to move from welfare to work. </p> <p>The truth is that the best way to increase our national income is to boost productivity and competitiveness - just as they have done in America. But thanks to increasing the increasing burden of regulation and taxation, Britain's productivity growth rate has fallen by a third since Labour came to office. And we have fallen from fourth to fifteenth in the international competitiveness league table - a drop of 11 places. </p> <p>Large scale increases in immigration are not going to solve Britain's productivity problems. But if left unchecked and uncontrolled it will place growing demands on our public services and on housing - demands which we may not be able to meet. It also risks undermining community relations in the UK. To quote again from the Government's Community Cohesion Panel:</p> <p>\"We believe that inward immigration does create tensions and that these do not necessarily revolve around race. It is easier for more affluent communities to be tolerant towards newcomers as they do not perceive them to be a threat ... By contrast, many disadvantaged communities will perceive that newcomers are in competition for scarce resources and public services, such as housing and school places. The pressure on resources in those areas is often intense and local services are often insufficient to meet the needs of the existing community, let alone newcomers. These fears cannot be disregarded\".</p> <p><b>An Annual Limit to Immigration </b><br></p> <p>I believe that each year Parliament should set a maximum limit on the number of people coming to Britain, just as they do in Australia. That limit should be determined by Britain's economic needs, the demands of family reunion and our moral obligation to give refuge to those fleeing persecution. </p> <p>And within each category of immigration we need root and branch reform to ensure not just that Parliament's limit can be met, but also to create a fairer system, which is less open to abuse. That will enable us to make a substantial reduction in the number of people coming into the UK.</p> <p><b>Work Permits </b><br></p> <p>Labour have quadrupled the number of work permits issued each year from 40,000 to 175,000. The work permit system has become a major source of immigration. Once here, permit holders are usually able to stay indefinitely. After four years permit holders can apply for settlement: a significant number do and 95 per cent of applications are granted.</p> <p>What is more the administration of the work permits system is a shambles - as James Cameron, the British Consul in Bucharest revealed earlier this year. Officials are working to a \"target\" - yet another government target - of deciding 90 per cent of all applications within 24 hours. Serious checks are impossible in that timescale. </p> <p>Conservatives will restore strict control over work permits. We will introduce a points-based system on the Australian model for the evaluation of applications. And we will reverse the assumption that a work permit will, almost automatically, lead to long term settlement.</p> <p><b>Asylum</b><br> </p> <p>The asylum system is another area of chaos. Many of those claiming asylum are not genuine refugees. The Home Office concedes that up to three-quarters of the people seeking asylum in Europe do not meet the criteria of full refugees. In Britain, only two in 10 applicants are granted asylum, while another two in 10 are granted permission to stay (\"leave to remain\" or \"humanitarian protection\"). </p> <p>Only one in five failed asylum seekers are deported. Failing to deport rejected asylum applicants encourages more people to claim asylum falsely. People who are not genuine asylum seekers know that even if their claim is rejected, they are overwhelmingly likely to be able to stay in the UK. </p> <p>Claiming asylum is being used as a means of getting round Britain's immigration controls. Peter Gilroy, Strategic Director of Social Services for Kent County Council (and the man responsible for the social services needs of asylum seekers entering through Dover, the busiest port of entry in the UK) has estimated that about 50 per cent of asylum seekers are \"in the category of coming here because they are trying to seek work and to make a better life for themselves\" </p> <p> To get here most asylum seekers must undertake a long, dangerous and expensive journey, often at the hands of people smugglers. Genuine refugees who cannot afford the cost - or are not strong enough to make that journey - cannot apply. </p> <p>The current system is helping to sustain an international people smuggling network. It is estimated that \"... a large proportion of asylum seekers arrive in the UK as the result of illegal people smuggling operations conducted by criminal gangs\". These criminal gangs charge would be asylum seekers thousands of pounds to bring them to Britain. </p> <p>The gangs' often cynical disregard for the welfare of their human cargo was brought into stark relief when the bodies of 58 Chinese immigrants were found in the back of a sealed container in a lorry at Dover in June 2000. They had all suffocated. It latter transpired that each of those on board had paid tens of thousands of dollars to Chinese smuggling gangs known as \"snakeheads\" to get to the UK. They had travelled from China through Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, France, Holland and Belgium on their way to Britain. </p> <p>A Conservative government will tackle these problems at their roots. We will pull out of the 1951 Refugee Convention, as is our right, by giving twelve month's notice to the Secretary General. </p> <p>The Convention is now thoroughly outdated. It was agreed during the Cold War when a relatively few number of people were able to escape from behind the Iron Curtain. Its authors could not have imagined that it would come to be exploited by tens of thousands of people every year. We will also enter reservations against the relevant parts of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>We will replace the Convention with British legislation, which will allow cases to be decided more swiftly. Genuine refugees will be welcomed, but those who are not will be swiftly removed. This will immediately deter people from falsely claiming asylum in Britain - significantly reducing the numbers.</p> <p>In the longer term I also want to end the current situation where people can only claim asylum if they enter Britain illegally or by deception. This is illogical and immoral. </p> <p><b>Integration</b><br></p> <p>Integration is a key part of any successful immigration policy. A common language is the most obvious binding element in any society. Without it, it is much harder for people to be active members of the community.</p> <p> It's important that people who make their home here learn the language of our nation. Of course people may choose to carry on speaking their family tongue at home - that must be a matter for them. But they do need to learn English properly too. </p> <p>David Davis and Tim Collins will soon announce a package of measures to help immigrants learn English. </p> <p><b>Conclusion</b><br></p> <p>Everything I have I owe to this country. My family came here with very little and made a life for themselves. I want others to benefit from the opportunities I had. Immigration is good for Britain - we are a stronger and more successful country because of the immigrant communities that have settled here. </p> <p>But we cannot continue to allow unlimited immigration into the United Kingdom indefinitely. Immigration needs to be controlled and it needs to be fair. </p> <p>Parliament needs to set an annual maximum limit on the number of people coming to Britain in the light of our country's needs. We need to get a grip on illegal immigration, reintroduce strict controls on work permits and take action to reduce the number of people falsely claiming asylum in this country. That will enable us to make a substantial reduction in the number of people coming into the UK. </p> <p>There are no easy answers to the challenges we face, but the proposals I have set out today are reasonable, clear and practical. </p> <p>They will ensure that we regain control of our borders, restore public confidence and thus permit the proper integration of newcomers into our society. It will also deal with the concerns of the Government's Community Cohesion Panel and help to maintain good record on community relations. </p> <p>These proposals are based not on dogma but on reason, common sense and what has worked round the world. They will enable Britain to move forward as a confident, diverse yet united society. That is an aspiration which almost everyone shares. The measures I have outlined today are the best means of achieving it.\"</p>",
  "Michael Howard today returned to the controversial issue of asylum, promising that a future Conservative government would impose a limit on the number of migrants admitted into Britain each year and tear up the UN convention on refugees. <p>The Tory leader also proposed the introduction of an Australian-style points-based system for deciding which applicants would be entitled to enter the country, with the aim of encouraging the arrival of skilled, qualified English-speaking professionals.</p> <p>Mr Howard insisted that he wanted Britain to continue to benefit from the economic and cultural contributions made by its immigrant communities and live up to its \"proud tradition of giving refuge to those fleeing persecution\".</p> <p>He cited his parents' own experience as refugees from fascism in the 1930s to prove his good intentions when it comes to the issues of asylum and immigration.</p> <p>\"Everything I have I owe to this country,\" he said. \"My family came here with very little and made a life for themselves.</p> <p>\"I want others to benefit from the opportunities I had. Immigration is good for Britain - we are a stronger and more successful country because of the immigrant communities that have settled here.\"</p> <p>Refugee groups, however, fear that his plans for an annual quota on immigrants would close the door on sudden influxes of asylum seekers fleeing the outbreak of war or repression.</p> <p>Habib Rahman of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: \"We are utterly shocked to hear that the Conservative party seems prepared to ditch Britain's long-standing humanitarian commitment to the [UN] convention.\"</p> <p>While the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said that Mr Howard's plans \"fly against the principle of welcoming people fleeing persecution\". </p> <p>\"Setting arbitrary quotas on the numbers of refugees would seriously jeopardise our international obligations,\" he warned.</p> <p>Labour's minister for citizenship, Des Browne, meanwhile, criticised Mr Howard's record on asylum when he was home secretary, saying that \"after four years in the job, it took 20 months just for an initial decision for an asylum seeker\".</p> <p>In his speech, Mr Howard condemned the home secretary, David Blunkett's recent comment that he did not see an \"obvious upper limit to legal immigration\".</p> <p>\"We cannot continue to allow unlimited immigration into the United Kingdom indefinitely.

  "At least 11 people were killed when a suicide car bomb exploded in a busy commercial district of Baghdad today. <p>The Associated Press reported that the driver of the car drove it to a photocopy shop in the al-Jamiyah area of western Baghdad where Iraqi national guard recruits were preparing their papers. </p> <p>The explosives were then detonated, injuring at least 54 people. Several shops were destroyed, and witnesses told Reuters that an ice cream restaurant had taken the worst of the blast. </p> <p>\"A man in a black Opel car drove up near the shop and detonated the explosives,\" policeman Ahmed Jassem said. Colonel Adnan Abdul-Rahman, an interior ministry official, confirmed that the blast had been caused by a suicide car bomber. </p> <p>\"I don't even know who they were targeting,\" Humam Abdul-Hadi, the owner of an electrical shop, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his face and neck, said. \"They just bombed people eating ice cream.\"</p> <p>US soldiers in armoured vehicles arrived to cordon off the area, while firefighters doused burning cars with water.</p> <p>The blast happened as militants in Iraq renewed their threats to kill the British hostage Kenneth Bigley. Clerics and Iraqi newspapers today reported that a spiritual leader of the Tawhid and Jihad group holding him hostage had been killed in a US airstrike. </p> <p>Sheik Abu Anas al-Shami, 35, was killed when a missile hit the car he was travelling in on Friday. The strike happened in the western Baghdad suburb of Abu Ghraib, reports said.</p> <p>Recent weeks have been some of the bloodiest in Iraq since the US president, George Bush, declared an end to major combat operations in May last year. Last week, 47 people died and 114 were wounded in an attack on a police headquarters in western Baghdad, the deadliest car bomb attack in the capital for six months.</p> <p>In fighting overnight, US tanks raided Baghdad's Shia district of Sadr City as aircraft bombed the area and helicopters flew low overhead. Hospital sources said 22 people had been killed and 71 wounded.</p> <p>Iraq's most influential Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, today accused US forces of this week breaking a truce in the southern city of Najaf by raiding the office of the rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. </p> <p>Under the truce deal, brokered by Mr Sistani, US forces were supposed to withdraw from the city.</p> <p>\"This step is considered contrary to the peace initiative on whose basis the Najaf crisis was solved,\" a statement said. \"We think that there was no justification for a military step of this type. [Sadr's] office had previously agreed on inspections by the Iraqi police, and the matter was completed with ease.\"</p>",
  "<p>Criticising EastEnders is something of a sport among television reviewers, with the ailing soap getting more of a battering than a haddock in Ian Beale's chip shop. </p> <p>Yesterday, after falling ratings, sex scandals and concern at the quality of scripts, the BBC responded by replacing the programme's executive producer. </p> <p>Louise Berridge would move to an unspecified \"major new drama project\", the corporation said. </p> <p>The soap's performance has a significant impact on the rest of the BBC1 schedule, but a BBC spokeswoman insisted that Ms Berridge had not been forced to step down. </p> <p>Her future had been the subject of speculation as criticism surrounding the series became intense. Only last week the BBC announced she would step back from the day-to-day running of the soap, with the appointment of a senior producer, Sharon Hughff, as her deputy. </p> <p>In a prepared statement, Mal Young, the BBC's controller of continuing drama series, praised Ms Berridge's two-year tenure. \"This must be the toughest programme-making role on British TV. Louise has done a superb job, overseeing some of the most talked about telly moments of the last three years. It's a relentless job, both as manager and lead creative of over 200 hours of primetime drama, in a very public spotlight. There are not many people talented or resilient enough to handle this job, and Louise has proved herself one of the few.\" </p> <p>Such warm words were not enough to melt the ice that has been forming around Ms Berridge. Her departure had been widely predicted, and the BBC1 controller, Lorraine Heggessey, was forced to defend her at the Edinburgh television festival last month, saying she was the victim of circumstances beyond her control. </p> <p>\"When you have a cast where one is ill, one pregnant, one who may be in rehab, and another in a car crash, that's when you end up being overdependent on a storyline about a kidney transplant,\" she said, referring to a much-criticised plot that was stretched beyond credibility due to cast absences. </p> <p>It is true that the fortunes of soaps go in cycles: in 2001 EastEnders' ITV rival Coronation Street was at the receiving end of opprobrium, and only recovered when its executive producer was replaced. Now it is EastEnders' turn. </p> <p>Many of the brickbats have been directed at the relentless misery of life in Albert Square. In a radio interview two weeks ago, Mr Young defended the bleak storylines: \"We have always been good at creating great kitchen sink drama. That's why people watch it. They want to wallow in the misery with us. You can come home from work and think, 'Well, at least my life is better than that lot.'\" </p> <p>The viewers did not agree. The return last year of \"Dirty\" Den Watts attracted nearly 17 million viewers. But the effect was short-lived, and last May the ratings fell to 6.4 million, the lowest in the programme's 20-year history, when ITV scheduled an episode of Emmerdale against it. </p> <p>Ms Berridge will be replaced by Kathleen Hutchison, executive producer of Holby City, the soapy medical drama that runs all year round, from where Ms Hughff was also transferred. \"Soap reaches the hearts of the nation with iconic characters and stories,\" Ms Hutchison said. </p> <p>Critics will be looking for her to introduce some of these characteristics to EastEnders, which has been plagued by script weaknesses, cast problems and the failure of new characters such as the Ferreira family, slated by British Asians for being woefully unbelievable. </p> <p>The off-screen antics of the stars have also threatened to provide more entertainment than the storylines; the most notorious red-top revelation was that Leslie Grantham, who plays Dirty Den, had been indulging in internet sex during breaks in filming. </p> <p>In her statement, Ms Berridge said: \"It's been a privilege to lead BBC1's number one show through the last two years, even when faced with the unexpected.\" It was unclear whether the irony was intended. </p> <p><strong> What the critics say ... </strong> <br></p> <p>My tapes of last week's EastEnders arrived with a note saying: \"Apologies for poor quality of pictures.\" Not a word though, about the abysmal quality of the writing and acting <br> <strong> Charlie Catchpole, Daily Express, September 6 2004 </strong> <br> </p> <p>This week EastEnders decided they really wanted us to suffer, so they made us watch Ian Beale flirting.

  "Fifteen years ago, more than 50 police raided the Church of the Ascension, Manchester, to seize and deport Sri Lankan political refugee Viraj Mendis. This week, he was back in the city to thank the campaigners that he says saved his life. <p>Mendis's return, for a two-week visit to raise awareness about the threat of renewed war in Sri Lanka, was glitch-free. He says: \"It seems unreal that, after they spent so much money and effort to deport me, I just walk in.\"</p> <p>His case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after he sought sanctuary in the church, helped by then vicar John Methuen (this week suspended from his post as Dean of Ripon cathedral). As a focal point for opposition to deportations under the Thatcher government, the campaign won unanimous backing from the 1987 Labour party conference.</p> <p>Paul Boateng, who was then a backbench Labour MP, was one of those who lent support. Mendis is genially unconvinced that Boateng - now a home office minister - would be quite so supportive today. He'd like to say hello, though, \"if only for old times' sake\".</p> <p>Cynics have implied that, as he is clearly still alive, his plea for asylum must have been bogus. Wrong, he says, the campaign saved him. \"Because of the publicity and drama of the campaign, there was enough pressure on the government in Sri Lanka for it to be counterproductive for something to happen to me.\"</p> <p>To protect him, eight British activists went to Sri Lanka with Mendis, a leftwing Sinhalese who supports the minority Tamil community. After a year of living dangerously, he escaped again to Germany, where the Bremen regional government gave him asylum.</p> <p>Because Mendis's wife is English - she had to go to Sri Lanka to marry him - he can safely re-enter Britain. But he sees few signs of sympathy for asylum seekers. Despite the change of government, his own situation is the exception: most face a \"far worse\" climate now, he says.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Mendis can be contacted at: <a href=\"mailto:viraj_mendis@gmx.net\">viraj_mendis@gmx.net</a></p>",
  "<p>From hearsay and a single photograph, staff nurse Sabitha Nambiar has a mental picture of Antrim, in the north of Northern Ireland. It is soon to be her home and, in her mind, it is very much like Shillong - a hill station in Meghalaya, north-east India's tea growing region - with Victorian bungalows, the world's wettest championship golf course, and daily power cuts. All she knows for sure are the maths. In Britain, nurses earn in one year what in India takes them a decade to earn. </p> <p>Before her night shift, over sweet tea, the din of car horns and a monsoon downpour in central Delhi, Nambiar explains that the idea of working in Britain came from her cousin, a nurse who left India to work in a private nursing home. \"My cousin in Surrey told me the experience is better than working in India,\" she says. \"There's a higher standard of living. I also thought I'd benefit from mingling with different sorts of people. I'm totally ignorant about Ireland. I'm told it's not like London. That it's much slower. That it's green and pleasant.\" </p> <p>Nambiar, who is planning to arrive in Antrim by the end of the year, is fast becoming the modern face of nursing in Britain. Four years ago, just 30 Indian nurses were registered to work in the UK. Today, more than 2,000 have registered. For the NHS, India is one of the main areas where it can poach health workers. Britain imports nurses because it does not have enough, and because India, according to its government, has too many - more than 8 million today, against 3.8 million 10 years ago. The country also has an edge over many other developing nations; English is widely spoken and it has a \"youth bulge\", with more than half the population under 30. </p> <p>Nambiar is 32, although she looks 20. Originally from Kerala, in southern India, she qualified in the north-east in 1994 and has worked in private and state hospitals in Delhi for the past seven years. What does she know about the NHS? \"I didn't ask,\" she says. \"I don't know anything about it.\" </p> <p>Anecdotally, she hears that British hospital culture will involve more team work and more professional development. In India, Nambiar says, nurses stagnate. It can take 15 years for a staff nurse to be promoted to sister. </p> <p>Getting to the UK is not easy. With guidance from her cousin, Nambiar jumped with relative ease the two crucial hurdles that enable Indian nurses to apply for jobs in Britain - provisional registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council and achieving the necessary grade in an international English language test. She propelled herself to the required \"good user\" level by paying a private coach to tutor her - between nursing shifts - for an hour every three days during a three-month period, at a cost of almost half a month's pay. </p> <p>She knew she had to avoid crooked Indian recruitment agents, who, she heard from nursing friends, asked 200,000 rupees (\u00a32,500) for non-existent or unqualified care work. \"If I'm asked for money, I wouldn't be interested,\" she says. \"I've got a secure job here in a good hospital in the capital, working with experts in their field. I know that life in the UK is very expensive, so without a proper job, things would be impossible.\" </p> <p>Like many of her contemporaries, she responded to an internet advertisement for nurses - in this case, a Belfast-based recruitment company. She met its representatives at a Delhi hotel, was interviewed and selected by a team from the Antrim hospital trust that had flown out to Delhi. </p> <p>While controversy in Britain over poaching nurses from the developing world last month prompted health ministers to accept that the NHS should leave sub-Saharan Africa's scarce supply of health workers alone, India's nursing workforce - thanks to an intergovernmental agreement - is still fair game. India has, officially, a surplus of nurses. But even so, some hospitals are beginning to feel the strain. </p> <p>To work in the NHS, nurses need at least three years' general nursing experience. Several nursing directors in India stated that poaching means hospitals are perpetually training nurses they barely get to use. \"I feel we train them, then we lose them,\" says Sudesh David, nursing superintendent of the prestigious Christian Medical College hospital in Ludhiana, Punjab. In the past four years, the hospital has seen at least 50 of its 430 nurses go to the UK each year. </p> <p>David has no trouble replacing her staff from the hospital's nursing college, she says. The problem is that they are less experienced. Britain is especially covetous of her specialist nurses. \"Once they develop and excel, we lose our most skilled and strongest nurses,\" she says. \"They want nurses trained in psychiatric, child, cardiac and intensive care.\" </p> <p>David does not begrudge her young staff new and lucrative opportunities. \"We feel very bad about them leaving, but hope they'll come back and bring new ideas to India,\" she says. \"We try to motivate them to stay, but this is their career, their life, after all. I can't say, 'Don't go.'\" </p> <p>A recent advertisement in the Times of India for 50 NHS nursing positions yielded 2,000 responses. \"After a couple of days, I'm deluged, says Caroline Draper, a Delhi-based international recruitment consultant for Translocation UK, a London agency that emphasises its adherence to the government's ethical recruitment code. \"And it's not always by nurses, either. We've had people, from bakers to lawyers, applying.\" </p> <p>Draper trawls through each CV, checking for the required nursing and language skills. Around 90% of applicants don't come up to scratch. She telephones the rest to hear their spoken English; around a fifth are fluent enough to work in a UK hospital. Their details are then sent to London, where qualifications, criminal records, occupational fitness and references are checked. In most cases, an NHS trust will then send members of its nursing personnel team to interview shortlisted candidates. </p> <p>\"They've got to be able to survive in the NHS,\" Draper says. \"Some of them are just too shy and they won't make it. Sometimes, you can tell if she'll be robust enough by the way she walks through the door - and whether she's got her husband or father with her.\" </p> <p> The company pays Draper - herself a former ward sister with 18 years' NHS experience - \u00a3100 for every nurse recruited. Translocation is paid a percentage of the annual salary of each nurse its clients hire - a sum, according to its managing director, that is \"subject to commercial confidentiality\". </p> <p>One satisfied Translocation customer, however, claims recruiting in India was cheaper than in the UK. \"And much more productive,\" adds Stuart Bootland, director of nursing at Bradford District Care Trust, which has hired 20 mental health nurses, with another 15 due to arrive. All his Indian nurses have some training in mental health nursing, with standards and competency equal to their British counterparts, he says. </p> <p>International recruitment, Bootland points out, is in addition to local initiatives. \"But this means we'll be able to function at full establishment,\" he says. </p> <p>Does he worry about leaving India short of psychiatric nurses? \"We've recruited a small number - one that we think won't deplete India's pool,\" he answers. </p> <p>The migration of nurses may have costs for India's health system, but it is also becoming big business. Outsourcing and nursing labour are new corporate buzzwords. Private hospitals are setting up companies for the sole purpose of grooming Indian nurses for foreign export. There has been a huge increase in the number of training schools in India compared with a decade ago, when there were only 60. Companies have built centres and hired language and cultural etiquette coaches to school local nurses in the ways of developed world nursing. They are chasing contracts - big ones - and making deals to supply nurses to hospitals thousands of miles away. </p> <p>One hospital group, Apollo Life, has contracted a company that prepared IT and call centre workers to teach nurses headed for the US in \"voice and accent neutralising\", \"presentation skills\" and \"dining etiquette\". Britain, which has long dominated the poaching game, will face stiff competition for nursing labour. Among Indian nurses, the US is increasingly becoming the country of choice. It grants them the elusive green card and, it is believed, a better living standard than in Britain. </p> <p>In his smart office, Sumanjit Chaudhry, chief executive of Max Healthstaff International, says his company was created not with the UK in mind, but the US. The market potential, he says, dwarfs India's outsourcing ventures to date - IT and call centres. By 2020, America will be short of a million nurses. \"India, with our English-speaking population, is going to be a major source,\" he predicts. \"The US is the largest market with the most attractive options.\" The company saw the nurses in its hospitals \"flying out of the window\" to work overseas. \"So it seemed sensible, if we couldn't beat 'em, to join 'em.\" </p> <p>Chaudhry leans back in his chair. \"A nurse in the US can earn $50,000 (\u00a328,000) a year, so there's every reason why an Indian nurse would want to go there,\" he says. \"And why shouldn't she?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Sabitha Nambiar is a pseudonym.</p>",
  "Like any parent, Mohamoud Mohamed Osman worries about keeping a roof over his children's heads. But the father of four has more reason than most to be concerned. <p>The 34-year-old and his wife, Safia, 29, live in a cramped, poorly maintained one-bedroom council flat in south-east London with their two daughters and two sons, who range in age from two to 11. Their fifth child is due early next spring. </p> <p>\"I'm worried about my children's future. They need space to do their homework and even to eat,\" he said through an interpreter. </p> <p>\"If we carry on living in these conditions, I'm afraid it will affect them all. My seven-year-old daughter, Safi, has epilepsy and needs to be in a quiet place because when there's noise her illness gets worse. We try to take care of her but she needs space. </p> <p>\"Usually there's someone sleeping in the kitchen, someone in the sitting room and someone in the bedroom. When there's only one place to eat, sleep and do their homework it's very, very difficult to live. The kitchen is so small that the fridge is in the sitting room and the roof leaks in both rooms so we have to keep our furniture and things out of the way.\" </p> <p>The family have lived in the flat since they fled Somalia to seek asylum in Britain five years ago. But they are 67th on their council's list for rehousing, which makes it unlikely that they will be offered better accommodation in the near future. </p> <p>\"My wife is pregnant again and when another baby comes we don't know what we'll do,\" Mr Osman said. </p> <p>He has indefinite leave to remain in the UK and hopes that when he finishes his English course he will be able to find work as a driver, as he did in Somalia. </p> <p>\"My dream is to get a job, so I could get a flat for my family myself,\" he said. </p> <p>\"For the last three years I have been calling the council and telling them how hard things are for us, but we are still on the waiting list.\"</p>",
  "<p>MPs and peers have warned that a compromise agreed in the parliamentary row over a legal ban on smacking children is likely to be found incompatible with the European convention on human rights in the future.</p> <p>The joint parliamentary committee on human rights yesterday published a report on the children bill now going through parliament, which has sparked a furious debate over a smacking ban.</p> <p>As the law now stands, parents are allowed to smack their children and can use a defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" if cases of common assault, wounding, grievous bodily harm or cruelty to persons under sixteen are brought against them because of injuries inflicted.</p> <p>Children's charities and other proponents of a smacking ban have urged that this defence be abolished in the children bill, effectively making smacking or beating children illegal. But ministers were worried that parents might be criminalised for trying to control their children.</p> <p>In July a compromise amendment to the bill was moved in the House of Lords to retain the \"reasonable chastisement\" defence in cases of common assault, but remove it in cases where parents face more serious charges. The compromise is understood to allow parents to smack their children - but not too hard.</p> <p>The joint human rights committee's report said the amendment will probably bring British law into line with a recent judgement by the European court of human rights, because it makes the defence unavailable where corporal punishment has breached article three of the European human rights convention.</p> <p>But the MPs and peers on the committee warned that in future the reasonable chastisement defence may be held to be incompatible with convention rights because the European court is increasingly referring to the UN convention on the rights of the child in its decisions - a convention that gives children greater protection.</p> <p>This means the children bill, as amended, might only temporarily meet the UK's human rights obligations.</p> <p>The committee also warned that children bill measures designed to make agencies delivering children's services work together were not strong enough.</p> <p>The duty on \"partner agencies\" to cooperate \"should be clarified to make quite explicit that it is an ongoing duty\", the report says. The duty should be \"direct\" rather than \"procedural\" and must be directly applied to private companies providing services under contract to public sector agencies.</p> <p>The MPs and peers also condemned the exclusion of immigration and asylum agencies from the duty to cooperate as \"unjustifiable discrimination against some children on grounds of nationality\".</p> <p>But the committee welcomed the creation of a statutory commissioner for children and young people in the bill.</p>",

The latest force to adopt it is Bedfordshire. Its head of child protection, Detective Superintendent Keith Garwood, says it now handles all information referred to the child protection team, whether from social services, an officer on patrol or elsewhere. </p> <p>The database helps officers look for patterns across cases and suggests links for officers to investigate. The system is especially useful for checks on job applicants carried out by the Criminal Records Bureau, where it is linked to the police national computer via a data warehouse. </p> <p>\"Previously, the bureau would ring up the child protection team and they would have to go through paper records,\" says Garwood. \"[Now,] even if the applicant is using a pseudonym, it will spot it, so long as it's been recorded somewhere.\" That alone would have raised concerns about the Soham killer Ian Huntley's application to work with children, he says. Capital One says the application, which runs on Windows 98, NT and XP, was developed using an Oracle 8i database.

All will rely on a link with health records, being developed by the NHS National Programme for IT, which in turn will connect to an electronic social care record. </p> <p>Meanwhile, basic data on every child in the land is likely to appear on two new databases: the Office for National Statistics' citizen information project and whatever database is created to support the national identity card. It is not yet clear how all these different systems will fit together. </p> <p>Last year's green paper, Every Child Matters, said the 150 or so \"top tier\" local authorities with responsibility for childcare should install IT to prevent a repetition of tragedies exemplified by the murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. However, authorities are still waiting for guidance on questions of technology and the legality of sharing data between agencies. A government-sponsored study of 135 authorities published last month reported that local authorities are \"confused by the conflicting guidance issued by different government departments\". </p> <p>The Children Bill, likely to become law late this autumn, may clarify the position. It will set a legal framework for sharing information between social workers, education authorities, the NHS and other agencies. And it will come none too soon for authorities already implementing systems. Two national initiatives are under way, sponsored by separate government departments. These are Information Sharing and Assessment (ISA) and Reducing Youth Offending Generic National Solution (Ryogens). </p> <p>The ISA initiative was set up by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) following the Climbi\u00e9 inquiry and Every Child Matters. ISA includes and supersedes systems known as identification, referral and tracking (IRT), which enable practitioners to share information about individual children. </p> <p>The idea is to build up a coherent narrative of concerns about a child, rather than a series of unrelated snapshots. For example, a teacher with concerns about a child would use IRT to find out whether other agencies are involved and identify a lead professional whom they could contact. </p> <p>One pioneering example of IRT is the Aware system at Telford and Wrekin, Shropshire. Aware is one of 10 \"trailblazer\" projects funded with \u00a31m each to develop and test new ways of information sharing and multi-agency working. </p> <p>Although the DfES describes IRT as a \"building block\" for its vision of shared information and assessment, no detailed specification has yet emerged of what the building block should look like. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the DfES has awarded 135 local authorities that are not trailblazers \u00a3100,000 each for \"early work on the professional practice aspects of information sharing\". An evaluation of these authorities' progress published last month found 69% were on course to meet requirements set out in the green paper. </p> <p>The main difficulty in authorities was the size and complexity of the task. \"Project managers had to negotiate a labyrinth of agencies, organisations, personnel and cultures and believe that, although they have the skills and commitment to do the job, they sometimes lacked the necessary resources and support,\" the report said. </p> <p>The main external difficulty remains uncertainty about the legality of sharing information between agencies. \"Project managers were unclear about the relatively untested legal position and confused by the conflicting guidance issued by different government departments,\" the report noted. </p> <p>In parallel with the work on ISA is a separate initiative, sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). Ryogens is an off-the-shelf IT system for sharing information about children and young adults at risk of falling into crime. The system works along similar principles to IRT: it receives alerts from different agencies concerned with an individual child to give early warning of trouble. Anyone entering information has to confirm it is being done legally, which means with the subject's consent or in accordance with a specific protocol. </p> <p>When the number of warnings reaches a threshold - set by the local authority - the system alerts a lead practitioner. Ryogens has been piloted at Warwickshire and at Tower Hamlets in London as one of the ODPM's 23 \"national projects\" to develop e-government technology. A sister project, Fame is working on a framework of rules for information sharing. </p> <p>Ryogens' second pilot phase begins next month. This will be based on a second version of the Ryogens software. One new feature is email alerting to help occasional users. </p> <p>\"Many practitioners won't use Ryogens every day, so they may miss a piece of relevant information,\" says Denbigh Cowley of the Ryogens national project. The new system will send them an email asking them to log in and take a look. \"If they have raised a concern, they would be informed that something has happened.\" Cowley stresses that emails will not contain sensitive information. </p> <p>Ryogens software is available now for a \u00a325,000 one-off cost, covering an unlimited number of users. </p> <p>While Cowley says Ryogens \"complements the Isa agenda\", he adds that it should not be seen as a replacement for a database of all children. \"Ryogens is about the children who are most vulnerable.\" </p> <p>However, Stephen Howes, a principal at Socitm Consulting, says Ryogens could help authorities along the way to Isa. \"It can be implemented fairly simply. It will have some sort of repository where information can be shared on a more detailed basis, subject to rules.\" </p> <p>Guy Mallison of consultants RSe says the two projects are beginning to come together. and that Isa now features in the priority service outcomes set by the ODPM for local e-government. </p> <p>Local authority managers concerned with data about children need to keep an eye on two developments outside their patch: several police forces are creating their own databases of child abuse and the NHS is creating a national system of electronic health records, which will include information relevant to social care. Traditionally, the police and NHS have been protective of their data, especially about sharing it with local authorities. </p> <p>This will have to change if the government's agenda is to become reality. Howes says the responsibility will fall on councils: \"Isa is very much an emphasis on local government leadership.\" </p> <p>Exercising such leadership, however, will be difficult until central government clarifies what it is doing with its various databases of children, sub-sets of children and of the general population. One idea ministers are considering is a central source of information about all 11 million children in Britain. This would be presented as a \"hub\", rather than a database with its \"big brother\" connotations. </p> <p>Many details need to be resolved, not least the link to proposed national population databases. One outstanding issue is the identity number to be used for children. Several pilots have used the 10-digit NHS identifier, the most up-to-date available. Yet this goes against NHS policy, which is that local authorities' departments may use the number but only for the purposes of NHS care. </p> <p>The consensus is that authorities should not rush into installing systems until central government decides on an architecture for sharing data about children. This should not, however, be an excuse for ignoring the agenda, says Mallison. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Reducing Youth Offending Generic National solution</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryogens.org.uk\">ryogens.org.uk</a> for Education and Skills: <a href=\"http://www.dfes.gov.uk\">dfes.gov.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Identification, referral and tracking</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cypu.gov.uk/\">cypu.gov.uk/</a> </p> <p><strong>Framework for Multi-agency Environments</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fame-uk.org\">fame-uk.org</a></p>",
  "<p>For a man with multiple death threats hanging over him, Peter Tatchell is remarkably composed. Not that he shares this view. \"I look completely exhausted; I probably wouldn't take a great picture,\" he says on the phone a few hours before we meet. Tatchell, social activist extraordinaire, has been working seven days a week on his latest campaign, against homophobic lyrics in reggae music, itself part of a long-running protest at discrimination against gay men and lesbians in Jamaica. </p> <p>Typically, the campaign has irked some liberal commentators. Tatchell has been derided for his ignorance of Jamaican culture and called a racist for demanding that two Jamaican reggae artists were banned from the Music of Black Origin Awards (Mobos). He shrugs. \"We've focused on eight artists who have released songs that have variously called for gay people to be shot, burned, stabbed, drowned and hung. These are incitements to murder, which is a criminal offence.\" </p> <p>Tatchell bombarded the Mobos with letters and emails, and implored the BBC not to broadcast the event. He led street demonstrations against what he has termed \"murder music\". The tactics finally bore fruit two weeks ago when Elephant Man and Vybx Kartel were dropped by the Mobos after they refused to apologise for homophobic lyrics. Elsewhere, he has pestered nightclubs and reggae festivals with requests to ban artists, with varying degrees of success. Some gigs have been cancelled. </p> <p>He accuses the liberal left and governments (both Jamaican and British) of failing to condemn hate lyrics or to come to the assistance of persecuted gay Jamaicans. This, he claims, is endorsing homophobia and is a \"benign form of racism\". </p> <p>The backlash has been vociferous. Instead of enjoying his Mobos victory, he is facing allegations both of racism and \"cultural imperialism\". He is \"stunned and hurt\" by some of the reactions - particularly from the black press. \"It is utterly bizarre,\" he says. \"I expected some opposition, but not the ill-founded accusations of racism. They have been emotionally devastating.\" </p> <p>He is visibly despondent. Being an oppressed minority is no excuse for oppressing another minority group, he says. He gains strength from the support of black gay rights groups, which have rallied to his side. All anyone has to do, Tatchell insists, is to look at his record of defending black people against racism, such as his campaigns against apartheid and, more recently, attempts to highlight human rights abuses by Robert Mugabe. (Tatchell says he was left brain damaged after being beaten by the Zimbabwean leader's henchmen when he confronted Mugabe on the steps of a hotel in Brussels last year). \"In 1983, neo-Nazis accused me of being an 'N'-lover because I stood up and defended the black community against white racists, and yet here we are 20 years later ... \" </p> <p>He sounds exasperated, but he's like a dog with a bone. \"The police uncovered a plot in 1995 by the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 to kill me because they hated the fact that I was defending black and gay people. And now I'm getting threats from some black people because I'm defending gay Jamaicans. I can't win.\" </p> <p>The threats are serious, he says. \"The Metropolitan Police have advised me there is a possibility that I may be killed. Some of the people we are targeting have connections with gangsters.\" So how afraid is he? \"It's sort of par for the course, y'know?\" He suddenly looks weary. His eyes lower for the only time in the interview. He admits to keeping a fire extinguisher by his bedside in his south London council flat in case of hate attacks. </p> <p>For almost four decades, Tatchell has been campaigning on controversial issues. While primarily concentrating on gay rights issues such as the age of consent, he has also brought his particular brand of activist politics to topics such as Aids and capital punishment. Current campaigns include defending the rights of gay Palestinians to seek asylum in Israel, and challenging the introduction of repressive antigay legislation in Russia. </p> <p>Born in Melbourne in 1952, Tatchell began campaigning in his teens, railing against the death penalty, the war in Vietnam and the treatment of Aborigines. After moving to the UK in 1971, he began a long struggle for gay and human rights, first with the Gay Liberation Front and eventually with the radical gay rights group OutRage!, which he co-founded in 1990. </p> <p>There have been two unsuccessful forays into mainstream politics - one as the Labour party's candidate in the Bermondsey by-election of 1983, in which he was demonised by the tabloid press for his homosexuality, and, almost two decades later, standing as an independent for the London Assembly. </p> <p>You wonder, however, if he has not achieved more outside mainstream politics. His methods have consistently provoked strong reactions, often being described as over the top and unnecessary. He once threw himself on former prime minister John Major's car, and in 1994 he outed 10 Church of England bishops - justified, he says, because they were \"colluding with homophobic policies\". Within a month, the church had issued its strongest condemnation of anti-gay discrimination and opened talks with lesbian and gay groups. </p> <p>Tatchell has been vilified from all sides of the political spectrum, variously described as an \"extremist\", an \"exhibitionist\", a \"homosexual terrorist\", a \"nigger lover\" and, now, as a \"racist\". Why does he continue in the face of such relentless assaults? \"Maybe I've got an over-developed conscience,\" he says, self-mockingly. \"I believe I am right. I focus on the issues that most other people are neglecting. I suppose I think: 'That could be me or a member of my family.'\" </p> <p>Tatchell recoils at the idea of taking credit for his achievements. \"That would be egotistic.\" He says he is \"unexceptional\" and \"only one of millions of people\" who feel the need to take action in the form of direct protest. </p> <p>An hour into the interview (most of which takes place outside the loos in a cavernous underground nightclub in Leicester Square), Tatchell is in full flow, his weariness evaporating. I ask if he is an angry person. \"Anger doesn't drive me; it's love and empathy with other human beings. I get upset. I internalise it.\" There's a long, loose laugh. </p> <p>Hasn't he ever just wanted to give up? \"Lots of times.\" He talks of his \"many sacrifices\" and says the absence of a loving relationship is among the most difficult. His meagre existence is another. During the course of our meeting, he refers to the fact that he has never had much money and that, unlike other gay rights groups - notably the pressure group, Stonewall - his has \"limited resources, no staff and no formal funding\". </p> <p>He is reluctant to admit it, but his health concerns now cast a long shadow over his work. \"The doctor told me after the Mugabe incident that I wouldn't be able to campaign in the same way. But I still try.\" </p> <p>He worries that the left, and New Labour, are letting down the marginalised people they should be defending, and that he despairs of some trends in the gay community. Most gay and lesbian MPs have been a \"big let down\", he sighs, adding: \"The commercialisation of gay culture is rather sad. Too many gay people have gone along with a set of values that judge people by their style and material possessions rather than their character.\" </p> <p>Has he any regrets? \"No.\" Not even regarding outing people? \"No.\" </p> <p>So after the Mobos, what does the future hold? He confesses to being so fatigued he has at times hallucinated, but insists there are other battles to be fought. \"I will continue to fight on behalf of persecuted Jamaicans. And there are other campaigns, just waiting to be taken off the shelf.\" </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Age</strong> 52 </p> <p><strong> Status</strong> Single </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> Mount Waverly high school, Melbourne, Australia.

  "Homelessness has risen twice as fast among ethnic minority households as among the population as a whole since Labour took power, according to a report published today by a leading housing charity. <p>Twice as many black and Asian families as white ones are living in conditions judged unfit for human habitation, Shelter found. They are seven times more likely to live in overcrowded conditions. </p> <p>The extent of the gulf suggests that its causes go beyond the economic disadvantage suffered by many ethnic minority communities. Shelter says more research is needed but suggests that factors include a lack of suitable accommodation for larger families, the failure of service providers to consider issues such as racial harassment, and potential discrimination by housing workers. </p> <p>Homelessness increased by 77% among ethnic minority households compared with 34% among the general population between 1997 and this year. The African Caribbean population has been particularly badly hit, with homelessness rising by 89%. </p> <p>In total, 30,000 ethnic minority households were homeless during 2003-04. They accounted for 20% of the families accepted as homeless by local authorities, even though they form only 7% of families throughout the UK. </p> <p>\"If you have a housing system entering a period of deep crisis, inevitably the price is paid by groups who are the most vulnerable and excluded, which in our society will include a high proportion of people from minority ethnic groups,\" said Adam Sampson, director of Shelter. </p> <p>\"There is a massive under-supply of affordable, quality housing for the poorest in our society. The number of homeless people in this country has doubled since Labour came to power and the length of time people are in emergency housing has more than doubled. </p> <p>\"The connection between bad housing and poor health, educational and behavioural outcomes means we are seeing another generation of children having their futures wrecked and being further locked into a cycle of deprivation.\" </p> <p>Mr Sampson said ethnic minority households often faced problems which others might not. Those from cultures with a tradition of living as an extended family could find housing providers did not accept their need to do so, or simply did not have large enough homes available. </p> <p>Other factors include racial harassment, which can prevent families from accepting housing in certain areas. </p> <p>The study suggests an increase in asylum applications since 1997, may have contributed to rising homelessness. </p> <p>Asylum seekers are not allowed to work or claim mainstream benefits while their claims are processed, but once granted refugee status or leave to remain, have only weeks to find their own accommodation before eviction. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister said the government had asked local authorities to provide figures on the ethnicity of those accepted as homeless. She added: \"The government has also commissioned research into the underlying causes of homelessness among black and minority ethnic groups, and ways to improve the effectiveness of services to directly meet people's needs.\"</p>",
  "German and Italian plans to establish asylum camps in north Africa are a dangerous resurrection of a discredited idea (EU revives Blunkett's asylum camp plan, September 20). A number of European governments and institutions, as well as the UN high commissioner for refugees, have already rejected similar proposals. Such centres would signal an abandonment of Europe's historic commitment to refugee protection. <p>Handing over people seeking safety in Europe to camps run by poor or repressive governments is a recipe for disaster. If European governments believe the problems of Africa should be solved with the help of Europe in Africa, they should use next month's G5 meeting to work to find genuine solutions to poverty and the conflict and human rights abuses from which asylum seekers flee. <br> <b> Phil Bloomer </b> <br> Oxfam  <b> Holly Cartner </b> <br> Human Rights Watch  <b>Maeve Sherlock </b> <br> Refugee Council  <b> Kate Allen </b> <br> Amnesty International UK</p>"
