  "<p><strong>This I Believe</strong><br>by Carlos Fuentes<br>translated by Kristina Cordero<br>Bloomsbury \u00a320, pp342</p> <p>Self-importance is the occupational disease of public life, so it isn't surprising that Carlos Fuentes, who has been Mexico's ambassador in Paris and is also his country's most celebrated novelist, should have picked up a double dose.</p> <p>As he remarks, Latin American countries in particular have looked to writers for their sense of national identity. Now he gives us his thoughts on a number of subjects, arranged alphabetically, from 'Amor' to 'Zurich'.</p> <p>The subjects fall into three main categories, the political ('Revolution', 'Globalisation' and, indeed, 'Politics'), the cultural ('Balzac', 'Faulkner' and 'Vel\u00e1zquez') and the personal, as exemplified by 'Children', 'Sex' and 'Silvia' , his second wife.</p> <p>The political pieces read as if they were written to be delivered to a crowd ('Let us move from identity to diversity through a path of respect'). It would have to be a docile crowd, though, to applaud 17 consecutive sentences beginning 'I am concerned...', particularly as the last one is the less than rabble-rousing: 'I am concerned about all that jeopardises the continuity of life.'</p> <p>When Fuentes talks about 'Education', he announces that it should be 'the first item on the agenda of every nation in the world', which has a familiar ring, but before he has finished he has slyly defined his terms. 'If the private sector does not support public education,' he suggests, 'it will marginalise its potential consumers.'</p> <p>More than that, he proposes that 'the challenge of education is to offer knowledge that is directly connected to professional goals'. The effect is of hearing the chancellor of a university talk for half an hour about excellence, then thank Pepsi-Cola for endowing the chair of carbonated drinks.</p> <p>Sometimes, Fuentes strikes a grand rhetorical note: 'Let us not open, as did Virgil in hell, an ivory gate to send false illusions into the world. Far more preferable is the patience of Job, for whom the waters ultimately eroded the rocks, but also allowed the tree to sprout anew.' Sometimes, he aims less high, as when he refers to 'the beauty, without exception, of all the children of Mexico'. This is as close to kissing babies as prose allows.</p> <p>When Fuentes discusses cultural matters, high and low jostle in the same sentence: 'Shakespeare grabbed words by the ass and made them shriek and bitch, showing us that the range of expression cannot be constrained by the constipated or famished genres of literature.' He quotes compulsively, although he often plays fast and loose with what he cites: 'Memory, succession and legitimacy are the true \"bare bodkin\" that Hamlet brandishes, though the price he pays will be the \"hush\" of death.'</p> <p>He quotes his own novels more frequently (on every subject) than any other literary source and pays far more respect to their continuity than he does when it comes to poor Shakespeare. He defers to his own authority. The implication is that these utterances are definitive, clinching what passes here for argument.</p> <p>There's a great deal of repetition in This I Believe, notably when the section on 'Reading' follows on from 'Quixote' with a discussion of... Don Quixote. Repetition is no sin when it follows a pattern of development, but there's no sign of that in these pages and only a couple of forlorn acknowledgments ('In an earlier section, I have alluded...'; As I mention elsewhere...') address the high level of redundancy in the volume.</p> <p>In the personal sections, Fuentes shows no signs of overcoming his addiction to pseudo-epigrammatic formulations: 'In the end, to know sex is to know the harbinger of the words of love, and to not know what follows because the harbinger is enough and interrupts the very thing it promises'; 'If all the women I have loved could be encapsulated in one, the only woman I have loved for ever encapsulates all the others.'</p> <p>It's as if he has been misled by a false syllogism; just because a paradox offends against sense at first sight, it doesn't follow that everything which offends against sense is a rewarding paradox.</p> <p>Having so many short sections excuses Fuentes from exploring his own contradictions in a way that might justify such a book. How to reconcile the prophet of ecological apocalypse with the high flier who likes nothing better than looking down from a plane on the Andes or the Rockies, and (in the section 'Urbanities') compares the virtues of 28 cities?</p> <p>There seems no connection between the public figure who harps on about the vital importance of feminism and the senior citizen who reminisces contentedly about the Mexico City brothels of his youth and celebrates urban seasons in sentences like: 'London: spring will bloom in two youthful breasts behind a sheath of transparent organdie.'</p> <p>A jarring third element is provided by a romanticism which refers to women as 'the fleeting voyagers of the dawn' and celebrates his lovely wife with the declaration: 'Every night I leave an invisible note on her pillow that says, \"I like you\".' Less fattening than chocolate, certainly, as well as less trouble.</p> <p>Some of the trouble must be due to Kristina Cordero, the translator. It's possible Fuentes writes a hideous Spanish which she faithfully renders into hideous English, but it seems more likely that he's an old smoothie as a stylist, which is how he can get away with so much vacuous preening in the original.</p> <p>As a translator, she is some way short of competence. What is 'the act of love without sex' (page 22)? Where is the English sense in this: 'From this, our Latin America, from these fertile, beautiful, aching, trampled lands that have been shot down by themselves and by those who covet either their poverty or their beauty - I don't know which - we ask, today, to globalise not only the fact but the right to make rights out of commerce and health, education and environment, work and security'?</p> <p>It's eccentric for Fuentes to quote Wittgenstein twice on one page - the same sentence - but zany for her to translate it two different ways. Bad enough for an author to repeat himself without the translator seizing the chance of another stab at a possible meaning.</p> <p>The strangest moment may have more to do with the translator than the author. Writing about his wonderful father ('a man of good humour, tenderness, punctuality: a good example'), he records that on the day he died, Fuentes Sr 'did two things: he tried on a new suit and he sexually harassed my mother'. Fuentes's attitudes towards women are dodgy enough, but can he really be praising Dad for cornering Mum in the kitchen? Perhaps the Spanish means something more like 'made gallant romantic advances to'.</p>",

  "<b> Language dies with woman</b> <br> Yang Huanyi, China's last woman proficient in the mysterious Nushu language, died at her home last week. She was thought to be 98. Yang learned possibly the world's only female-specific language from seven sworn sisters as a girl. Nushu characters are structured by four kinds of strokes, including dots, horizontals, verticals and arcs. Linguists believe her death marks the end of a 400-year-old tradition in which women shared their innermost feelings through codes incomprehensible to men. <p> <b>Israel bulldozes refugee camp</b><br> Israeli army bulldozers tore down 35 homes in the Palestinian Khan Younis refugee camp last week, according to a UN aid official.Ahead of the raid, a 55-year-old Palestinian was killed and five people were wounded in an airstrike.

  "<p>Poor Britney and her ghastly nuptials: tracksuits, chicken wings, burgers, it seemed less of a wedding than what you'd come across during a bank holiday toilet stop at a motorway service station. The generous might care to spin the event as a statement on the ridiculous overblown ceremonies of the rich and famous, a defiant refusal to keep up with the Zeta-Joneses, but that would be ignoring the fact that Britney already has one rushed, boozed-up, ill-conceived wedding under her belt, doesn't really a need a second, is actually, remember, a multi-million selling artist and young woman of note.</p> <p>And yet she still ends up making her vows in a room smelling of cheeseburgers, surrounded by people with 'Pimps' and 'Maids' written on their backs, that dancer husband of hers flashing a smile that seemed all dollar signs and subtext. I didn't think it was trashy. The young Elizabeth Taylor flashing diamonds as big as babies' heads was trashy; Roseanne Barr cackling about her liposuction on live television was trashy; 'Trashy' has often been good, self-affirming, especially for non-Wasp females in show business. Britney's wedding seemed something altogether different, such a long dark howl of desperation and low self-esteem she could have been auditioning in front of the priest to join Nirvana.</p> <p>Of course, serial weddings aren't new in showbiz circles. Watching J-Lo in action, it often seems as if we are coming to the point of adopting a damning new anti-female axiom: Never the bridesmaid, always the bride. However, while many might debate the long-term future of J-Lo's liaisons, the point is they also have no past, no history; no sense of emotional hangover. Even the one that came after Ben Affleck never seemed to be about Ben Affleck, but rather about a woman who just loves putting on big dresses and getting married and, rather like a cake-cutting Terminator, cannot be stopped. By contrast, Britney's weddings, both of them, indeed Britney's entire behaviour over the past few years, seems to be coming from the same place - her tortuous split from childhood sweetheart and fiance, Justin Timberlake.</p> <p>Look again at those chaotic boozy wedding snaps of the new Mr and Mrs Federline, and that's what screams out loud and clear - 'Rebound!' In Britney's case, such a huge and obvious rebound it's a surprise she's not pictured suspended in mid-air. Not much is known about the rebound probably because those people who are rebounding don't want to know. When you're newly enamoured, it's your fresh start, and you don't want to hear the word 'syndrome'. You don't want to be told that you're bouncing around like an out-of-control spacehopper trying to get anywhere else but where you used to be.</p> <p>A self-justifying madness takes over accompanied by the kind of grown-up reasonable behaviour you might expect from a toddler who's dropped their ice lolly in the puddle and won't rest until an ice cream appears instead. 'It just feels so right,' rebounders say, as they arrange to move in with the man or woman they met selling the Big Issue outside Sainsbury's two weeks ago, whose main claim to their heart seems to be a distinct lack in common with their previous partner. Could this be the future for Personal Ads: 'Man seeks woman who is not blonde, not 5ft 7in, and doesn't like chocolate, for temporarily fulfilling rebound relationship'? Either that or the new partner has lots in common with the ex, rather too much, in fact. Here I'm thinking of the man who told me his new girlfriend reminded him of his ex in all ways but the most important: 'I haven't pissed her off yet.'</p> <p>The only thing that sucks worse than being in a rebound relationship is being the third party in a rebound relationship - the bounced-upon, as it were. And that's because being in a relationship with someone rebounding is like trying to grab a snowflake: at first contact with the heat of reality, it melts. It was bad enough for Diana, and all that 'there were three of us in that relationship' stuff, but what about if the third person is a ghost, a memory, an itch that wasn't properly scratched; what if the main thing about you is just a negative - that you're not her or him, and that will do for now.</p> <p>It's mad really. If somebody knocked on your door and said: 'Hello, could I waste the next six months of your life brooding about my ex' you would probably scream and slam the door, but still you get people trying to turn their rebound into something real (true love, sharing last Rolos, weddings in tracksuits) simply to prove they've moved on, which is all-round sad and selfish. All this said, I hope Britney enjoyed her wedding. If she wants to get in touch I know a great caterer for her divorce. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Wimbledon isn't even half as good as the last major movie on the subject, Anthony Harvey's pretty awful Players (1979) in which Dean-Paul Martin defeated Ilie Nastase, John McEnroe, John Lloyd and Vijay Amritraj on his way to beating Guillermo Vilas on Centre Court. </p> <p>In this film, fading British star Peter Colt (Paul Bettany), rated 119th in the world, gets a wild card to Wimbledon just as he's on the point of retiring, but never gets to face any real-life players, though McEnroe commentates rather self-consciously. Players was a cross between The Hustler and Camille. Wimbledon is a Working Title Films production and a feeble successor to its Hugh Grant films, Four Weddings, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones and Love Actually, from which the American screenwriters cull most of their scenes and situations. </p> <p>At its centre is an American tennis celebrity, Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), who meets cute with the diffident Hugh Grant figure (Bettany). They have a whimsical courtship against a touristic London, he becomes a more committed player as a result of his relationship with this forceful Yank, there's the usual embarrassing public profession of love, conducted, in this case, on TV, and that celebrated Working Title airport dash for a rendez-vous. There's also a Rhys Ifans role in the form of the hero's feckless brother. </p> <p>Nothing about this movie rings true, and the makers have no interest in examining the minds of professional sports people. Victory comes through love, apparently, and the hero's success rejuvenates his middle-class, middle-aged parents' marriage, resulting in a vigorous game of mixed doubles on the kitchen table. But there's more sexual chemistry between the Flowerpot Men and Little Weed than there is between Dunst and Bettany, and the idea of a Brit winning Wimbledon still looks as likely as Colonel Fawcett emerging from the Brazilian jungle or George Bush get ting the Nobel Peace Prize. </p> <p>Quite as bad, if more interesting, is Spike Lee's <strong> She Hate Me</strong>, a defence of whistle-blowing, an expos\u00e9 of corporate greed and corruption, an assault on hypocrisy, an attack on the exploitation of blacks in business organisations, and a proclamation by a director generally regarded as homophobic that lesbians have the right to have children. </p> <p>Anthony Mackie plays Jack Armstrong, a high-flying African-American business executive who's fired after blowing the whistle on his biotech organisation over its false claims for an Aids cure, and finds himself a persecuted outcast. </p> <p>To sustain his way of life, he impregnates lesbian busi ness women for $10,000 a time, usually in batches of five or six, and when he needs chemical reinforcement for his considerable sexual prowess there is what must be Hollywood's first product placement for Viagra. The film goes on and on. </p> <p>There are animated sequences of sperms with Jack's face, variously grinning, grimacing or showing fatigue as they go up Fallopian tubes, and montages of Jack having sex, and of the women he's serviced undergoing labour. </p> <p>Satirical recreations of Watergate are inserted to celebrate the black night watchman, Fred Weeks, who became an unemployed pariah after his diligence led to the arrest of the burglars. The movie is a crude, sentimental mess, though full of good intentions. Its one good joke comes at the end of the opening credits: a montage of US presidential portraits on banknotes concludes with a smirking George W Bush on a three-dollar bill. </p> <p>The rest of the week's films are thrillers, the best of which is <strong> Cellular</strong>, directed by veteran stuntman David R Ellis and based on a story by Larry Cohen, to whose recent Phone Booth it is a companion piece. </p> <p>Where Phone Booth centres on a man trapped by a tormentor in a New York telephone kiosk, Cellular works through a mobile phone and never lets up as it bounces around Los Angeles like a pinball, dropping in on Santa Monica, Westwood, Los Angeles airport and Century City. Kim Basinger plays a science teacher kidnapped just after putting her son on the school bus. Her abductors smash the wall phone of the attic where she's locked in. But she manages to tie up some wires and establish contact with the cellphone of an irresponsible surfer (Chris Evans). </p> <p>Once convinced of her plight, he gets involved in an increasingly desperate rescue bid and, in the process, begins to acquire character. You never know what's going to happen next. Our own Jason Statham is the chief heavy and William H Macy is excellent as a dedicated cop on the point of retirement. His role and the climax on Santa Monica pier make the film look like a version of the Michael Douglas film Falling Down but without the political agenda. </p> <p>Equally good, and only slightly more leisurely, is C\u00e9dric Kahn's <strong> Red Lights</strong>, a transposition from the States to France of a George Simenon novel in which the fraying marriage of an icily successful lawyer (Carole Bouquet) and a hard-drinking, self-loathing loser (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) falls apart as they drive a grey Rover from Paris to Bordeaux to pick up their children from summer camp. She deserts him to take a train and he drives on, getting steadily drunker. </p> <p>There are radio bulletins about a dangerous murderer having escaped from jail and heading south-west, and he becomes an illuminating part of their problem. Both actors are first-rate. </p> <p>Also French but deliberately less civilised is <strong> Switchblade Romance</strong> (aka Haute Tension), an unabashed, unironic homage to Hollywood slasher films of the 1970s, particularly The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween . </p> <p>Two female university students drive to the remote farmhouse where the parents and brother of one of them live. They pass, without seeing, a filthy old van like the one in Jeepers Creepers , from which the unseen driver drops a severed head. That night, the van stops outside the farmhouse and mayhem ensues as a remorseless killer knifes, shoots and leaves. The makers deliver the goods to those who like this kind of thing, but there's a final twist that's meant to end the film in a victory roll but instead results in a fatal tailspin. </p> <p>In <strong> Save the Green Planet</strong>, yet another Korean curiosity, a sadistic homicidal nutter and his half-sharp girlfriend kidnap a corrupt industrial tycoon in the belief that he's an extraterrestrial who can help save the world from imminent destruction. It's as if Hitchcock, Kubrick and Spielberg had got together to pay homage to Ed Wood. </p> <p><strong> Spivs</strong> is a disappointing, soft-hearted British crime movie that starts out like The Sting and ends up like Stephen Frears's Dirty Pretty Things as a gang of small-time London conmen accidentally stumble into the line of fire provided by Russian people-smugglers. Ken Stott is effective as an ageing conman. </p> <p>Co-produced by Marvel Comics, <strong> The Punisher</strong> brings to life the cartoon-strip character Frank Castle, an FBI undercover man (Tom Jane), who sets off on a revenge trip when a Tampa-based hoodlum (John Travolta) massacres his extended family. It's a boneheaded affair with an unpleasant line in sadistically relished torture. </p> <p><strong> Vodka Lemon </strong> is a small, sweet-natured movie set one snowy winter in an impoverished Kurdish village in Armenia where an elderly widower and a middle-aged widow console each other and drink a lot of vodka. </p> <p>'We didn't have freedom then,' a villager says of life in the USSR. 'But we had everything else,' someone replies. </p> <p><strong>Top five films</strong></p> <p><strong> Ae Fond Kiss</strong> (15) <br>A moving story of star-crossed lovers in Glasgow finds Ken Loach in unusually romantic, apolitical mode. </p> <p><strong> Collateral</strong> (15) <br>Hit man Tom Cruise takes cabbie Jamie Foxx on a gripping journey to the end of the night. </p> <p><strong> Open Water </strong> (15) <br>A yuppie couple confront their worst nightmare on a scuba-diving vacation in Caribbean. </p> <p><strong> Hero</strong> (12A) <br>Elegant martial arts fable. </p> <p><strong> The Motorcycle diaries</strong> (15)<br> Charming account of the young Che Guevara exploring Latin America.</p>",
  "<p>Everyone - except those in the England dressing room - is bellowing out the battle cry 'Bring on the Aussies'. Never mind yesterday's defeat: since Tuesday, when Michael Vaughan's one-day side thrashed Australia at Edgbaston, the pundit and the punter have been salivating about next summer's Ashes series. Who would you rather face, Harmison or McGrath? No contest. Doesn't Flintoff smash it farther than Gilchrist? The Aussies are creaking, while Vaughan's buoyant, relatively young side have yet to reach their peak. </p> <p>But Vaughan, unusually, was determined to play the killjoy after that semi-final victory. 'If we are honest, we are still way behind them [the Australians] in terms of experience and expertise,' he said. Tuesday was a one-off game and there are a lot of deliveries to be bowled 'in the right areas' before the Ashes series commences as autumn approaches next year. </p> <p>Amazingly, we will be kicking our heels next summer until 21 July 2005, which is the first day of the first Test against Australia. There will be the temptation to preview the Ashes series week in, week out for 10 months. We'll try to avoid that. Before next July there is the tour of South Africa, where England have yet to win a series since the hosts' return to the international scene. Then we will have to yawn our way through two Tests against Bangladesh and, even worse, a triangular series with Bangladesh and Australia. We cannot keep 'Freddie' and 'Harmy' permanently on ice until then. </p> <p>It is easy to understand why the captains of both sides refused to read too much into the game on Tuesday. Yet that victory in Birmingham does mean something, even if it took place in an autumnal gale at a half-empty Edgbaston at the back end of English cricket's longest season. They may not admit it, but England cricketers have been humbled so frequently by Australia that plenty of scars remain. Now this batch of players can at least recognise that Australia can be beaten; they are mortal. If you cut them, does the ball not speed for four? </p> <p>As Andrew Strauss, who had never played against Australia before, nervelessly cruised to his half-century without breaking sweat, I wondered whether he realised that those guys in yellow were in fact Australians. But Strauss is a bright bloke. He knew and then amazed me by saying that beating Australia last Tuesday was the highlight of his summer. This from a man who had hit a century at Lord's on his Test debut. That's how much it matters to beat the Aussies, whatever the form of the game. </p> <p>Strauss will not have forgotten his debut, but it seems a long time ago when he was handed his first Test cap on 20 May. Nasser Hussain, that polished TV commentator, was still playing the game and his new mates up in the media centre were all pronouncing sombrely that New Zealand posed a genuine threat. They did in that match, but England's victory at Lord's set the ball rolling for an unprecedented summer of Test success. </p> <p>Seven consecutive wins prompt our fascination about the Ashes series. Add the semi-final victory over Australia and you can understand why the few executives remaining at the England and Wales Cricket Board are purring. This week the ECB's negotiations for the new TV and radio deals for 2006 onwards are taking place. It is not a bad time to be selling cricket. </p> <p>That match against New Zealand at Lord's may be remembered as belonging to Strauss in his first Test, or Hussain in his last. They provided the melodrama: Strauss run out by blinkered old Nass just short of a second century before Hussain, hitherto hardly a Roy of the Rovers figure, cracks a cover drive to reach his century and win the game before announcing his retirement. Not a bad way to go. </p> <p>At the time I thought Hussain might be joined on the sidelines by Ashley Giles. For me, this was Giles's match. With my usual foresight I wrote in these pages: 'Unless he produces something special today [the Sunday when New Zealand were in their second innings] Giles could be condemned to the county circuit for a long time.' He had been humbled in the first innings. As soon as he was tossed the ball, the New Zealanders attacked him disdainfully. He could be allowed only five of the 103 overs they received. He yielded 32 runs. The perception was that anyone but Giles would improve the Test side. </p> <p>On that Sunday, Giles hardly shone, but he survived. Marcus Trescothick, captaining England in Vaughan's remarkably fortuitous absence (if he had been fit, we would not have discovered Strauss), shrewdly tossed Giles the ball early - a much-needed expression of confidence. Over the wicket he bowled and this time the Kiwis decided to sit on him. He settled; there were three middle-order wickets. They could not drop Giles after all. In the last five Tests of the summer he would go on to take 28 wickets. England's supposed weakest link had become a match winner. </p> <p>Giles himself acknowledges the help of Steve Bull, England's sports psychologist. The stubborn faith of Duncan Fletcher and Vaughan must have helped as well. In another era he would have been discarded. His game had transformed by the time he left Trent Bridge after the third victory over New Zealand. At the beginning of the summer he was bowling like Gary Rhodes, by the end he was more like Wilfred. Giles, not Flintoff and Harmison, whom we expected to excel, was the surprising star turn of the summer. </p> <p>Perhaps they would never have dropped him anyway. The treatment of Giles epitomises the approach of the England hierarchy. Trust and loyalty have become key elements. They do not discard anyone easily now; they have faith in their chosen players. Derek Randall and Jack Russell in different eras always adopted the philosophy of 'treat every Test as your last'. The current batch of England players can feel more secure. </p> <p>Recently they stuck with Flintoff and Harmison right through their barren spells to be spectacularly rewarded during the past nine months. When faced with the choice of Mark Butcher or Ian Bell for the winter tour they stuck with Butcher. Loyalty breeds confidence and now places must be earned. So just 15 players were used in this summer's Test series and all of them are comfortable with one another; all celebrate their colleagues' success. They are as close-knit as county sides of old. Indeed England is their side. They seldom play for anyone else. </p> <p>There have not been many 'Duncan days' this summer - the ones when England have performed so ineptly that the coach has to be wheeled out to talk to the press - and that's a blessing for all concerned. Fletcher makes Bernhard Langer and Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson sound like the Two Ronnies. </p> <p>Yet Fletcher deserves credit that he never craves as he hovers in the background. He is the consultant. He gives Vaughan freedom to run the show, thereby enhancing his captain's authority. He never criticises his players publicly. He is the modern style of coach, hardly oozing charisma but self-effacing, superbly organised and capable of instilling discipline with the raising of an eyebrow. Sir Clive may have to wait a while for that job to become available. </p> <p>Now Vaughan leads a side who mirror his own character. His team are at ease with themselves, relaxed and patently enjoying themselves (except, perhaps, for the last hour at the Oval yesterday evening). This could never have happened under Hussain; perhaps it could not have happened without Hussain, who was there, bristling and unsmiling, when the framework was established. Hussain's side became hard to beat. Vaughan's side believe they can beat anyone - except perhaps the Aussies. </p> <p>Against New Zealand, England were victorious even though their opponents notched up 386, 409 and 384 in the first innings of the three Tests. Apart from a blip at Old Trafford, when England started to believe their own publicity for a couple of days, West Indies were steamrollered. The killjoys may say that England have beaten only modest opposition. In the past they have had plenty of trouble trying to do just that. </p> <p>South Africa on their home turf should provide a sterner challenge, but I shall be surprised if England do not return victorious from the Test series next February. Flintoff and Harmison may be Vaughan's jewels, but the strength of his side is now that the supposed weakest links, the plain Janes of the bowling attack, Giles and Matthew Hoggard, have found a way to prosper at the highest level. </p> <p>Moreover, England now have seven batsmen they can happily toss into their Test team (the six who are destined for South Africa plus Bell). I do not think South Africa possess the same depth of talent. Australia do.

  "George Bush's grandfather, the late US senator Prescott Bush, was a director and shareholder of companies that profited from their involvement with the financial backers of Nazi Germany. <p>The Guardian has obtained confirmation from newly discovered files in the US National Archives that a firm of which Prescott Bush was a director was involved with the financial architects of Nazism. </p> <p>His business dealings, which continued until his company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act, has led more than 60 years later to a civil action for damages being brought in Germany against the Bush family by two former slave labourers at Auschwitz and to a hum of pre-election controversy. </p> <p>The evidence has also prompted one former US Nazi war crimes prosecutor to argue that the late senator's action should have been grounds for prosecution for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. </p> <p>The debate over Prescott Bush's behaviour has been bubbling under the surface for some time. There has been a steady internet chatter about the \"Bush/Nazi\" connection, much of it inaccurate and unfair. But the new documents, many of which were only declassified last year, show that even after America had entered the war and when there was already significant information about the Nazis' plans and policies, he worked for and profited from companies closely involved with the very German businesses that financed Hitler's rise to power. It has also been suggested that the money he made from these dealings helped to establish the Bush family fortune and set up its political dynasty. </p> <p>Remarkably, little of Bush's dealings with Germany has received public scrutiny, partly because of the secret status of the documentation involving him. But now the multibillion dollar legal action for damages by two Holocaust survivors against the Bush family, and the imminent publication of three books on the subject are threatening to make Prescott Bush's business history an uncomfortable issue for his grandson, George W, as he seeks re-election. </p> <p>While there is no suggestion that Prescott Bush was sympathetic to the Nazi cause, the documents reveal that the firm he worked for, Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH), acted as a US base for the German industrialist, Fritz Thyssen, who helped finance Hitler in the 1930s before falling out with him at the end of the decade. The Guardian has seen evidence that shows Bush was the director of the New York-based Union Banking Corporation (UBC) that represented Thyssen's US interests and he continued to work for the bank after America entered the war. </p> <p><b> Tantalising</b><br> </p> <p> Bush was also on the board of at least one of the companies that formed part of a multinational network of front companies to allow Thyssen to move assets around the world. </p> <p>Thyssen owned the largest steel and coal company in Germany and grew rich from Hitler's efforts to re-arm between the two world wars. One of the pillars in Thyssen's international corporate web, UBC, worked exclusively for, and was owned by, a Thyssen-controlled bank in the Netherlands. More tantalising are Bush's links to the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC), based in mineral rich Silesia on the German-Polish border. During the war, the company made use of Nazi slave labour from the concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The ownership of CSSC changed hands several times in the 1930s, but documents from the US National Archive declassified last year link Bush to CSSC, although it is not clear if he and UBC were still involved in the company when Thyssen's American assets were seized in 1942. </p> <p>Three sets of archives spell out Prescott Bush's involvement. All three are readily available, thanks to the efficient US archive system and a helpful and dedicated staff at both the Library of Congress in Washington and the National Archives at the University of Maryland. </p> <p>The first set of files, the Harriman papers in the Library of Congress, show that Prescott Bush was a director and shareholder of a number of companies involved with Thyssen. </p> <p>The second set of papers, which are in the National Archives, are contained in vesting order number 248 which records the seizure of the company assets. What these files show is that on October 20 1942 the alien property custodian seized the assets of the UBC, of which Prescott Bush was a director. Having gone through the books of the bank, further seizures were made against two affiliates, the Holland-American Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation. By November, the Silesian-American Company, another of Prescott Bush's ventures, had also been seized. </p> <p>The third set of documents, also at the National Archives, are contained in the files on IG Farben, who was prosecuted for war crimes. </p> <p>A report issued by the Office of Alien Property Custodian in 1942 stated of the companies that \"since 1939, these (steel and mining) properties have been in possession of and have been operated by the German government and have undoubtedly been of considerable assistance to that country's war effort\". </p> <p>Prescott Bush, a 6ft 4in charmer with a rich singing voice, was the founder of the Bush political dynasty and was once considered a potential presidential candidate himself. Like his son, George, and grandson, George W, he went to Yale where he was, again like his descendants, a member of the secretive and influential Skull and Bones student society. He was an artillery captain in the first world war and married Dorothy Walker, the daughter of George Herbert Walker, in 1921. </p> <p>In 1924, his father-in-law, a well-known St Louis investment banker, helped set him up in business in New York with Averill Harriman, the wealthy son of railroad magnate E H Harriman in New York, who had gone into banking. </p> <p>One of the first jobs Walker gave Bush was to manage UBC. Bush was a founding member of the bank and the incorporation documents, which list him as one of seven directors, show he owned one share in UBC worth $125. </p> <p>The bank was set up by Harriman and Bush's father-in-law to provide a US bank for the Thyssens, Germany's most powerful industrial family. </p> <p>August Thyssen, the founder of the dynasty had been a major contributor to Germany's first world war effort and in the 1920s, he and his sons Fritz and Heinrich established a network of overseas banks and companies so their assets and money could be whisked offshore if threatened again. </p> <p>By the time Fritz Thyssen inherited the business empire in 1926, Germany's economic recovery was faltering. After hearing Adolf Hitler speak, Thyssen became mesmerised by the young firebrand. He joined the Nazi party in December 1931 and admits backing Hitler in his autobiography, I Paid Hitler, when the National Socialists were still a radical fringe party. He stepped in several times to bail out the struggling party: in 1928 Thyssen had bought the Barlow Palace on Briennerstrasse, in Munich, which Hitler converted into the Brown House, the headquarters of the Nazi party. The money came from another Thyssen overseas institution, the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvarrt in Rotterdam. </p> <p>By the late 1930s, Brown Brothers Harriman, which claimed to be the world's largest private investment bank, and UBC had bought and shipped millions of dollars of gold, fuel, steel, coal and US treasury bonds to Germany, both feeding and financing Hitler's build-up to war. </p> <p>Between 1931 and 1933 UBC bought more than $8m worth of gold, of which $3m was shipped abroad. According to documents seen by the Guardian, after UBC was set up it transferred $2m to BBH accounts and between 1924 and 1940 the assets of UBC hovered around $3m, dropping to $1m only on a few occasions. </p> <p>In 1941, Thyssen fled Germany after falling out with Hitler but he was captured in France and detained for the remainder of the war. </p> <p>There was nothing illegal in doing business with the Thyssens throughout the 1930s and many of America's best-known business names invested heavily in the German economic recovery. However, everything changed after Germany invaded Poland in 1939. Even then it could be argued that BBH was within its rights continuing business relations with the Thyssens until the end of 1941 as the US was still technically neutral until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The trouble started on July 30 1942 when the New York Herald-Tribune ran an article entitled \"Hitler's Angel Has $3m in US Bank\". UBC's huge gold purchases had raised suspicions that the bank was in fact a \"secret nest egg\" hidden in New York for Thyssen and other Nazi bigwigs. The Alien Property Commission (APC) launched an investigation. </p> <p>There is no dispute over the fact that the US government seized a string of assets controlled by BBH - including UBC and SAC - in the autumn of 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy act. What is in dispute is if Harriman, Walker and Bush did more than own these companies on paper. </p> <p>Erwin May, a treasury attache and officer for the department of investigation in the APC, was assigned to look into UBC's business. The first fact to emerge was that Roland Harriman, Prescott Bush and the other directors didn't actually own their shares in UBC but merely held them on behalf of Bank voor Handel. Strangely, no one seemed to know who owned the Rotterdam-based bank, including UBC's president. </p> <p>May wrote in his report of August 16 1941: \"Union Banking Corporation, incorporated August 4 1924, is wholly owned by the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. My investigation has produced no evidence as to the ownership of the Dutch bank. Mr Cornelis [sic] Lievense, president of UBC, claims no knowledge as to the ownership of the Bank voor Handel but believes it possible that Baron Heinrich Thyssen, brother of Fritz Thyssen, may own a substantial interest.\" </p> <p>May cleared the bank of holding a golden nest egg for the Nazi leaders but went on to describe a network of companies spreading out from UBC across Europe, America and Canada, and how money from voor Handel travelled to these companies through UBC. </p> <p>By September May had traced the origins of the non-American board members and found that Dutchman HJ Kouwenhoven - who met with Harriman in 1924 to set up UBC - had several other jobs: in addition to being the managing director of voor Handel he was also the director of the August Thyssen bank in Berlin and a director of Fritz Thyssen's Union Steel Works, the holding company that controlled Thyssen's steel and coal mine empire in Germany. </p> <p>Within a few weeks, Homer Jones, the chief of the APC investigation and research division sent a memo to the executive committee of APC recommending the US government vest UBC and its assets. Jones named the directors of the bank in the memo, including Prescott Bush's name, and wrote: \"Said stock is held by the above named individuals, however, solely as nominees for the Bank voor Handel, Rotterdam, Holland, which is owned by one or more of the Thyssen family, nationals of Germany and Hungary. The 4,000 shares hereinbefore set out are therefore beneficially owned and help for the interests of enemy nationals, and are vestible by the APC,\" according to the memo from the National Archives seen by the Guardian. </p> <p><b> Red-handed</b><br> </p> <p>Jones recommended that the assets be liquidated for the benefit of the government, but instead UBC was maintained intact and eventually returned to the American shareholders after the war. Some claim that Bush sold his share in UBC after the war for $1.5m - a huge amount of money at the time - but there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. No further action was ever taken nor was the investigation continued, despite the fact UBC was caught red-handed operating a American shell company for the Thyssen family eight months after America had entered the war and that this was the bank that had partly financed Hitler's rise to power. </p> <p>The most tantalising part of the story remains shrouded in mystery: the connection, if any, between Prescott Bush, Thyssen, Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC) and Auschwitz. </p> <p>Thyssen's partner in United Steel Works, which had coal mines and steel plants across the region, was Friedrich Flick, another steel magnate who also owned part of IG Farben, the powerful German chemical company. </p> <p>Flick's plants in Poland made heavy use of slave labour from the concentration camps in Poland. According to a New York Times article published in March 18 1934 Flick owned two-thirds of CSSC while \"American interests\" held the rest. </p> <p>The US National Archive documents show that BBH's involvement with CSSC was more than simply holding the shares in the mid-1930s. Bush's friend and fellow \"bonesman\" Knight Woolley, another partner at BBH, wrote to Averill Harriman in January 1933 warning of problems with CSSC after the Poles started their drive to nationalise the plant. \"The Consolidated Silesian Steel Company situation has become increasingly complicated, and I have accordingly brought in Sullivan and Cromwell, in order to be sure that our interests are protected,\" wrote Knight. \"After studying the situation Foster Dulles is insisting that their man in Berlin get into the picture and obtain the information which the directors here should have. You will recall that Foster is a director and he is particularly anxious to be certain that there is no liability attaching to the American directors.\" </p> <p>But the ownership of the CSSC between 1939 when the Germans invaded Poland and 1942 when the US government vested UBC and SAC is not clear. </p> <p>\"SAC held coal mines and definitely owned CSSC between 1934 and 1935, but when SAC was vested there was no trace of CSSC. All concrete evidence of its ownership disappears after 1935 and there are only a few traces in 1938 and 1939,\" says Eva Schweitzer, the journalist and author whose book, America and the Holocaust, is published next month. </p> <p>Silesia was quickly made part of the German Reich after the invasion, but while Polish factories were seized by the Nazis, those belonging to the still neutral Americans (and some other nationals) were treated more carefully as Hitler was still hoping to persuade the US to at least sit out the war as a neutral country. Schweitzer says American interests were dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The Nazis bought some out, but not others. </p> <p>The two Holocaust survivors suing the US government and the Bush family for a total of $40bn in compensation claim both materially benefited from Auschwitz slave labour during the second world war. </p> <p>Kurt Julius Goldstein, 87, and Peter Gingold, 85, began a class action in America in 2001, but the case was thrown out by Judge Rosemary Collier on the grounds that the government cannot be held liable under the principle of \"state sovereignty\". </p> <p>Jan Lissmann, one of the lawyers for the survivors, said: \"President Bush withdrew President Bill Clinton's signature from the treaty [that founded the court] not only to protect Americans, but also to protect himself and his family.\" </p> <p>Lissmann argues that genocide-related cases are covered by international law, which does hold governments accountable for their actions. He claims the ruling was invalid as no hearing took place. </p> <p>In their claims, Mr Goldstein and Mr Gingold, honorary chairman of the League of Anti-fascists, suggest the Americans were aware of what was happening at Auschwitz and should have bombed the camp. </p> <p>The lawyers also filed a motion in The Hague asking for an opinion on whether state sovereignty is a valid reason for refusing to hear their case. A ruling is expected within a month. </p> <p>The petition to The Hague states: \"From April 1944 on, the American Air Force could have destroyed the camp with air raids, as well as the railway bridges and railway lines from Hungary to Auschwitz. The murder of about 400,000 Hungarian Holocaust victims could have been prevented.\" </p> <p>The case is built around a January 22 1944 executive order signed by President Franklin Roosevelt calling on the government to take all measures to rescue the European Jews. The lawyers claim the order was ignored because of pressure brought by a group of big American companies, including BBH, where Prescott Bush was a director. </p> <p>Lissmann said: \"If we have a positive ruling from the court it will cause [president] Bush huge problems and make him personally liable to pay compensation.\" </p> <p>The US government and the Bush family deny all the claims against them. </p> <p>In addition to Eva Schweitzer's book, two other books are about to be published that raise the subject of Prescott Bush's business history. The author of the second book, to be published next year, John Loftus, is a former US attorney who prosecuted Nazi war criminals in the 70s. Now living in St Petersburg, Florida and earning his living as a security commentator for Fox News and ABC radio, Loftus is working on a novel which uses some of the material he has uncovered on Bush. Loftus stressed that what Prescott Bush was involved in was just what many other American and British businessmen were doing at the time. </p> <p>\"You can't blame Bush for what his grandfather did any more than you can blame Jack Kennedy for what his father did - bought Nazi stocks - but what is important is the cover-up, how it could have gone on so successfully for half a century, and does that have implications for us today?\" he said. </p> <p>\"This was the mechanism by which Hitler was funded to come to power, this was the mechanism by which the Third Reich's defence industry was re-armed, this was the mechanism by which Nazi profits were repatriated back to the American owners, this was the mechanism by which investigations into the financial laundering of the Third Reich were blunted,\" said Loftus, who is vice-chairman of the Holocaust Museum in St Petersburg. </p> <p>\"The Union Banking Corporation was a holding company for the Nazis, for Fritz Thyssen,\" said Loftus. \"At various times, the Bush family has tried to spin it, saying they were owned by a Dutch bank and it wasn't until the Nazis took over Holland that they realised that now the Nazis controlled the apparent company and that is why the Bush supporters claim when the war was over they got their money back. Both the American treasury investigations and the intelligence investigations in Europe completely bely that, it's absolute horseshit. They always knew who the ultimate beneficiaries were.\" </p> <p>\"There is no one left alive who could be prosecuted but they did get away with it,\" said Loftus. \"As a former federal prosecutor, I would make a case for Prescott Bush, his father-in-law (George Walker) and Averill Harriman [to be prosecuted] for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. They remained on the boards of these companies knowing that they were of financial benefit to the nation of Germany.\" </p> <p>Loftus said Prescott Bush must have been aware of what was happening in Germany at the time. \"My take on him was that he was a not terribly successful in-law who did what Herbert Walker told him to. Walker and Harriman were the two evil geniuses, they didn't care about the Nazis any more than they cared about their investments with the Bolsheviks.\" </p> <p>What is also at issue is how much money Bush made from his involvement. His supporters suggest that he had one token share. Loftus disputes this, citing sources in \"the banking and intelligence communities\" and suggesting that the Bush family, through George Herbert Walker and Prescott, got $1.5m out of the involvement. There is, however, no paper trail to this sum. </p> <p>The third person going into print on the subject is John Buchanan, 54, a Miami-based magazine journalist who started examining the files while working on a screenplay. Last year, Buchanan published his findings in the venerable but small-circulation New Hampshire Gazette under the headline \"Documents in National Archives Prove George Bush's Grandfather Traded With the Nazis - Even After Pearl Harbor\". He expands on this in his book to be published next month - Fixing America: Breaking the Stranglehold of Corporate Rule, Big Media and the Religious Right. </p> <p>In the article, Buchanan, who has worked mainly in the trade and music press with a spell as a muckraking reporter in Miami, claimed that \"the essential facts have appeared on the internet and in relatively obscure books but were dismissed by the media and Bush family as undocumented diatribes\". </p> <p>Buchanan suffers from hypermania, a form of manic depression, and when he found himself rebuffed in his initial efforts to interest the media, he responded with a series of threats against the journalists and media outlets that had spurned him. The threats, contained in e-mails, suggested that he would expose the journalists as \"traitors to the truth\". </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, he soon had difficulty getting his calls returned. Most seriously, he faced aggravated stalking charges in Miami, in connection with a man with whom he had fallen out over the best way to publicise his findings. The charges were dropped last month. </p> <p><b> Biography</b><br> </p> <p> Buchanan said he regretted his behaviour had damaged his credibility but his main aim was to secure publicity for the story. Both Loftus and Schweitzer say Buchanan has come up with previously undisclosed documentation. </p> <p>The Bush family have largely responded with no comment to any reference to Prescott Bush. Brown Brothers Harriman also declined to comment. </p> <p>The Bush family recently approved a flattering biography of Prescott Bush entitled Duty, Honour, Country by Mickey Herskowitz. The publishers, Rutledge Hill Press, promised the book would \"deal honestly with Prescott Bush's alleged business relationships with Nazi industrialists and other accusations\". </p> <p>In fact, the allegations are dealt with in less than two pages. The book refers to the Herald-Tribune story by saying that \"a person of less established ethics would have panicked ... Bush and his partners at Brown Brothers Harriman informed the government regulators that the account, opened in the late 1930s, was 'an unpaid courtesy for a client' ... Prescott Bush acted quickly and openly on behalf of the firm, served well by a reputation that had never been compromised. He made available all records and all documents. Viewed six decades later in the era of serial corporate scandals and shattered careers, he received what can be viewed as the ultimate clean bill.\" </p> <p>The Prescott Bush story has been condemned by both conservatives and some liberals as having nothing to do with the current president. It has also been suggested that Prescott Bush had little to do with Averill Harriman and that the two men opposed each other politically. </p> <p>However, documents from the Harriman papers include a flattering wartime profile of Harriman in the New York Journal American and next to it in the files is a letter to the financial editor of that paper from Prescott Bush congratulating the paper for running the profile. He added that Harriman's \"performance and his whole attitude has been a source of inspiration and pride to his partners and his friends\". </p> <p>The Anti-Defamation League in the US is supportive of Prescott Bush and the Bush family. In a statement last year they said that \"rumours about the alleged Nazi 'ties' of the late Prescott Bush ... have circulated widely through the internet in recent years. These charges are untenable and politically motivated ... Prescott Bush was neither a Nazi nor a Nazi sympathiser.\" </p> <p>However, one of the country's oldest Jewish publications, the Jewish Advocate, has aired the controversy in detail. </p> <p>More than 60 years after Prescott Bush came briefly under scrutiny at the time of a faraway war, his grandson is facing a different kind of scrutiny but one underpinned by the same perception that, for some people, war can be a profitable business.</p>",

  "The bus goes downhill all the way, a metaphorical as well as a physical journey from the pleasant heights on which I live, to the centre of the city where I work. We leave behind the houses of bankers, therapists and writers, pass the huge hospital, and then pick up and set down among inner-city housing estates, Victorian terraces, canals, railway stations and, finally, offices. <p>The day before writing this I was at the back of the bus when two immense women got on. The first must have weighed nearly 20 stone, was wearing a singlet and short skirt and carrying a teddy bear. The second, whom she called \"Muuuuuuum!\", had dyed blonde hair and clung to a red and white checked handbag with the words \"fuck you\" written on it. They occupied four seats between them and began a loud conversation. </p> <p>A week earlier on the same bus, coming the other way in the late afternoon, a girl of about 14, with bleary eyes and smelling of alcohol, had taken a call on her mobile. For several minutes this girl maintained a unilateral shouting match with her unseen companion, throwing in every swearword she knew. After a particularly blue patch I suggested, very gently, that she might swear less. It didn't work. </p> <p>A fortnight before that - once again on the bus - I had watched as a woman with small daughter, outraged by some infraction I didn't see, whacked the tiny girl round the side of her head. The kid never shed a tear, but an elderly middle-class man behind them leaned over and said, \"You shouldn't hit her like that.\" </p> <p>\"Mind your own business!\" replied the woman. </p> <p>\"It is my business,\" he said. </p> <p>It didn't have to be his business. And maybe in the future it won't be. If we hadn't been on the bus we would not have seen the child being struck, or heard the drunk child cursing, or been disconcerted and vaguely threatened by the \"fuck you\" handbag. Perhaps we would have viewed these things from the window of the car as we drove past. What had all this dysfunction and difficulty to do with us, after all? There are a thousand ways of escaping it if you have the money; you need never feel threatened or uncomfortable again. </p> <p>There is plenty - as we are always being reminded - to feel uncomfortable about. The so-called feral children, allowed to run wild and neglected by mothers and fathers who, having fulfilled their biological role, have nothing left to offer their wild offspring. The moronic gangs of Game Boy-maddened adolescents who congregate on the pavement outside your house and engage in mass urination. The swearing drunks, predatory addicts, pit-bull owners, beggars, buggers and lunatics. The alienated and unintelligible huddled masses from other lands, cast up on the concrete beaches of our inner cities. </p> <p>Would you want your child to attend a school where they have to employ a machine to detect flick knives, and where the teachers are assaulted by the pupils or by parents? If you will not even court the possibility of that happening then you can go private, or move to an area where you think the schools aren't like that. You can sequester yourself away from the worst of the otherness. Or, if your resources don't stretch to a place in a leafy paradise, you can sequester the worst of it away from you - do the exiling rather than becoming the exile. </p> <p>The former is, apparently, well under way in America. In this most mobile and rootless of societies, there is a huge demand to recreate that idealised community of the 50s, the small town of It's A Wonderful World. It was estimated recently that 7m households, or 6% of the total, had \"forted up\", by going to live in gated communities, protected by fences and security guards, permitted access on the production of key cards or entry codes. Affluent black people were less likely to live in gated communities than their wealthy white or Hispanic counterparts, perhaps because of their own very recent experience of exclusion. </p> <p>Where would all this lead? Margaret Atwood, in her dystopic novel Oryx and Crake, takes this a step or two further and creates a world in which gated communities have become the Compounds, where the knowledge and scientific workers for biotech corporations live and work, guarded by armed security men. Outside, visible from the trains and toll-ways that link the Compounds, are the Pleeblands, where people toil, consume and exist in a state of under-educated chronic insecurity. As the hero's father explains to him, it is like a throwback to the days of castles and moated manor houses. Or (as he does not say) to Edgar Allan Poe's Masque of the Red Death, where the denizens of a high-walled fortress imagine themselves to be immune to the plague raging in the countryside round about. </p> <p>The British have not given themselves over to \"forting up\", except insofar as some people imagine we can prevent immigration to these islands by treating asylum seekers badly. Instead we have \"white flight\", in which thousands of middle-class families move to the countryside or semi-rural areas, and spend the rest of their lives transporting their children from place to place in people-carriers, or writing columns about adultery in Warminster and buying bantams in Ludlow. </p> <p>But there are other ways to create space between you and the unwanted others. If you cannot get out of the areas with bad people in them, maybe you can throw the bad people out of the areas. You can make entry to prisons easier and exit from them harder, you can make admission to schools more conditional on anticipated behaviour, and expulsion from them - when that anticipation is disappointed - more common. You can expand the use of antisocial behaviour orders, lowering the annoyance threshold and covering a greater range of antisocial actions. You can throw out your human refuse and wonder where all that anger and despair will eventually fetch up. </p> <p>Small acts of exclusion are certainly preferable to the alternative of social apartheid. If they are used rarely, and as part of a strategy to rejuvenate or restore threatened neighbourhoods or schools, then they can help to prevent the exodus of those who are mobile enough to get out. But if they are your weapons of first and only resort, then by 2020 we will have created psychological shanty towns, inhabited by those whom we have decided we don't want among us. </p> <p>There are other, better possibilities, and the evidence for them too is all around us. The young who are helping to reconstruct our inner cities as diverse and dynamic places to live and work; the expansion of higher education to sections of the population for whom, 20 years ago, education would have ended at 16; the normality, in some places, of mixed relationships and marriages; the education of disabled children in regular schools; the provision of more and better childcare for those who work and for those who don't; the recognition of the widespread and complex nature of mental illness - all these are contraindications to the dystopic vision of our future. </p> <p>I don't take this optimistic view simply because I love flowers, Lassie movies and the ickle children, but because I don't believe apartheid works. Though treating well those who are easily marginalised or excluded can sometimes seem impossibly difficult and very expensive, treating them badly almost always costs more. And then (who knows), you could, somehow, become one of the excluded yourself. </p> <p>The \"others\" almost always want the same thing as the rest of us, even if their ways of achieving it seem so intolerable. They aren't after impossible amounts of easily gotten wealth, or the right to live in filth and criminality, but they need recognition as human beings. They piss on us because no one notices them when they don't. The only time someone like me looks at that drunk girl on the bus is when she calls everyone a cunt. That's the thing we have to change.</p>",
  "The past 30 years has been a generation of dramatic change in the shape of family life. That pace will not be continued in the next 20. <p>The next two decades will be a period in which already well-established trends are consolidated. That is the consensus among researchers. And all are agreed that by 2020 it will be very hard to talk of a \"typical family\", such will be the variety of shapes and types of families.</p> <p>The most marked characteristic of families since the 1960s has been that the traditional conception of the British family has disintegrated. The married couple with 2.4 children is disappearing. The sequence of life events - marriage, sex and children - has been radically reordered. Marriage rarely comes first and increasingly does not happen at all. Over the past 30 years, levels of cohabitation have trebled, the number of babies born outside marriage has quintupled, and the number of single-parent families has trebled. </p> <p>The most dramatic change, however, has been to the \"happy ever after\" bit in the picture of family life. In the past 30 years, the rate of divorce has doubled; and half of all children now experience their parents' divorce before they are 16. </p> <p>All four trends - cohabitation, divorce, births outside marriage and single parents - are likely to be even more pronounced by 2020. There is no evidence that any of them are easing. Much has been made of the fact that the divorce rate appears to have reached a plateau - Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe - but it is still rising in first marriages. Cohabitation arrangements are even more likely to break down than marriages. So what will be accepted as a general rule of family life in 2020 will be the brittle nature of the core relationship between the parents. </p> <p>\"There have been 20 years of dramatic change and the diversity of family structures is much greater. The proportion of single-parent families will probably continue to bob around 20%, but there will probably be more stepfamilies in the future,\" says David Utting of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who is also one of the authors of The Handbook of Parenting.</p> <p>While the underlying trends reshaping families will not change, our attitudes to those trends will. The recent period of revolutionary upheaval will bed down into social acceptability. The stigma that used to surround divorce and illegitimacy will be a subject only for the history books. Gay and lesbian partnerships, with rights enshrined in law, will no longer prompt comment. Family life will have adjusted to a pattern of serial monogamy, with a much larger number of stepfamilies. Lone parenthood will be a common phenomenon, but not necessarily a long-lasting one: on average, single parenthood lasts five years now, but that could drop lower by 2020 as the \"churn rate\" of relationship breakdown increases. </p> <p>The diversity of family forms will be striking by 2020. Children living with both their biological parents in the same household will be in the minority. There will be dozens of different types of co-parenting arrangements, with combinations of stepfamilies, or adults with children from previous relationships entering long-term relationships with others in the same position but choosing not to live together.</p> <p>From the vantage point of 2020, there will be some amusement at the heated debates this scenario inspired at the turn of the century. Talk of family breakdown will cause wry smiles as people attribute the kind of moral panic seen in the late 20th century to a particular kind of centennial angst. At least, that is the view of Christina Hardyment, author of The Future of the Family. She argues that the overriding picture is not so much one of family breakdown as of a radical restructuring that allows for just as much emotional commitment as ever.</p> <p>\"There is an alternative view to the doom-laden prophesy that families are falling apart,\" says Hardyment. \"In fact, the future of the family is stronger than ever - all the research shows that families are hugely valued and will continue to be.\"</p> <p>That is borne out by successive British Social Attitude Surveys, which show clearly that while family members live further apart, they turn to each other when important life events take place. Hardyment points to the fact that families are still responsible for the bulk of socialising in British life and that family members talking to each other account for a large proportion of telephone usage. For Hardyment, the most important factor is that \"the relationship between adults is chosen rather than one of economic necessity. That's a tremendous change in the basis of the relationship.\"</p> <p>One of the most dramatic social changes of the past 30 years has been in women's patterns of employment. In the UK the proportion of women in full-time employment has trebled in the past 30 years and maternal employment has leapt from 57% to 65% during the 1990s. With their new economic power, women are able to negotiate more equal relationships - already one in five women earn more than their partners. That proportion is likely to increase over the next decades as a generation of high-achieving schoolgirls arrives in the labour market. Women now make up more than half the intake of traditional professions such as law and medicine. </p> <p>The norm in families now is for one male full-time worker and one female part-time. By 2020, more women will be the primary breadwinner, though that shift will be restricted by the fact that while earning power is being redistributed within the heterosexual couple, caring responsibilities have proved more resistant to change. A disproportionate amount of housework and childcare is still done by women. </p> <p>This renegotiation of the economics of the couple is what the social theorist Anthony Giddens celebrated as the \"pure relationship\" in his Reith Lectures of 1999. He heralded a new era for the family as the old structures of patriarchy, duty and deference crumble to give way to a more democratic model between partners, and between parents and their children. Giddens argued that \"individualisation\" - how people define their identity - shapes family experiences, as people choose to develop only those relationships that promise them emotional integrity. </p> <p>Fiona Williams has led the Care, Values and the Future of Welfare research project at Leeds University for five years. She argues that Giddens' thinking has overstated the extent to which people are atomistic individuals who seek fulfilment in personal relationships. \"There may be seriality in sexual relationships, but that doesn't lead to fragmentation of the family,\" she says. \"People will have different experiences over their lifetimes - of marriage, of cohabitation, of single parenthood - but in many of them they are negotiating complex and deeply held commitments.\" </p> <p>In fact, the major characteristic of the 21st-century family is that the relationship between parents and children has been charged with a much greater intensity, commitment and pleasure. \"Parenting has gained in political, economic and emotional significance,\" says Williams. \"Parents and children have more emotional investment in each other. The issue is the quality of the relationship, not just its functionality. Children and their parents talk of each other as friends whom they can talk to - now, fathers want as much of that quality of relationship as mothers have. The relationship between parents and children has got stronger.\"</p> <p>What goes along with the greater emotional investment is a longer financial dependency. Children used to be off their parents' hands by 18, but the combination of student loans, university fees and rising property prices has already reversed that, and the trend is likely to continue. Parenthood is well on its way to becoming a minimum 25-year deal. The way generations in the family are connected by vertical links is sometimes characterised as the \"beanpole family\" - long and thin. As family sizes shrink, the number of siblings and cousins will dwindle while the intergenerational relationships become more intense. That beanpole family will present the state with some particular challenges in the 2020s, adds Williams. The strength of the parent-child relationship might mean that today's children will expect a lot of support from the state to care for their aged parents. Meanwhile, grandparents will want to help with the care of their grandchildren but will have to carry on working to fund their pensions. </p> <p>Many researchers believe the past 30 years have seen not so much the breakdown of the family as its reinvention. The baby-boomers adapted family structures in line with their aspirations to autonomy, self-definition and emotional integrity. Over the course of a generation, they have taken the family unit apart rather as a car mechanic might an engine. The great shibboleths of western family life have been dismantled: sex and marriage used to be interlinked - as did marriage and children, as did heterosexuality and marriage. Those links have been broken and people can assemble the bits as they wish: the worth accorded to individual autonomy has hugely increased and will continue to grow. </p> <p> Despite the moral panic generated by these shifts, one aspect of the reinvented family that has been less controversial - in relative terms - has been the delinking of genetic material and parenthood. Donated semen to help couples in which the man is infertile has been used since the 1960s, and donated eggs are a common part of infertility treatment. Test-tube babies and surrogate mothers are no longer a novelty. What has been firmly established is that parenthood does not always entail direct genetic inheritance; the bonding and strength of relationship is not determined by common genetic material. </p> <p>But the strong resistance in British public opinion to some developments of reproductive technologies - such as cloning and choosing a baby's characteristics, the creation of so-called designer babies - shows no sign of abating. By 2020, the techniques to develop a cloned embryo will almost certainly exist (the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has already given a centre in Newcastle the go-ahead to begin research) and will probably be practised elsewhere in the world. It will be almost impossible for the government to prevent people becoming fertility tourists, travelling to find the treatment they want. But it is a moot point as to whether public opinion will have shifted to allow parents these choices in their own country.</p> <p>The baby-boomers' reinvention of family has ensured that increasingly there will be no collective narrative about how intimate relationships should be structured and the order in which major life events should unfold. Adulthood will not carry with it expectations of achieving certain relationship milestones, such as getting married or becoming a parent. But while the options for personal freedom will have been enormously enlarged, that will bring with it a degree of confusion and disorientation, because individuals' wishes are sure, in many cases, to conflict: to have children or not; to marry or not; to stick together or separate. Without norms, some individuals will happily negotiate their way through the choices, but others will find it more difficult. </p> <p>Despite the rising tolerance of relationship breakdown and divorce, there is still a tremendous attachment to the ideal of a stable, lifelong commitment, points out Mary MacLeod, chief executive of the National Family and Parenting Institute. The vast majority of people tell surveys they want to spend their life with one other person. Children, in particular, are very attached to living in a household with both their mother and father. MacCleod acknowledges it is \"troubling\" that, in effect, children's expectations of family life are not, and increasingly will not be, met. There is some evidence we are getting better at divorcing - there is still a long way to go - but there is no getting away from the fact that the serial monogamy of the future will be disruptive and difficult for children. Research has already shown that children of divorced parents have, on average, a lower rate of educational achievement and higher incidence of mental health problems in adulthood. There will be increasing pressure on couples to achieve a \"good divorce\" for the sake of their children.</p> <p>The increased freedom of the reinvented family has also brought a doubling in single-person households and a sharp rise in the proportion of childless women. In part, these developments are attributable to increased choice but, in part, it is the cost that is paid for choice. In a significant minority of people's lives by 2020, family will not play a major role and friendship will be much more important in these people's emotional lives. Those friendships may often entail strong commitment to mutual support so friends can help each other through life crises. For many in 2020, \"significant others\" will be as likely to refer to a few close friends as a husband or mother. </p> <p>But the attenuated family structures will leave some vulnerable. Loneliness and depression will be more common, and some groups, such as the elderly, will be particularly vulnerable. As geographical mobility continues to spread families over greater distances and the smaller family size increases the dependency of the elderly on their one or two children, loneliness in the final decades of our longer lives will be a huge issue. Given that women live longer than men, they will be disproportionately affected; by 2020 we will be discussing the feminisation of loneliness and searching for strategies to develop greater peer sociability to compensate. </p> <p>The ageing of the British population by 2020 will be a major political and social issue - the number of people over pensionable age will increase from 10.9 million now to 13.2million in 2026. But the workers of 2020 will be bracing themselves for an even older age profile when they retire, because we are expected to reach the peak of 15 million pensioners in 2040. </p> <p>We know we will work for longer and live for longer. But the big unknown is how the medical treatment and care we need in our old age will be financed. Utting points to research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that indicates that by 2020 the funding implications for care will be acute. Will taxes have to rise to pay for the number of heart operations needed for octogenarians? These will be the dilemmas for the electorate in the 2020s. Alongside financing the huge costs of medical treatment will be the enormous challenge of funding the much more prosaic matter of caring for the frail elderly - dressing them, cooking their meals, doing their housework and helping them to wash. By 2020, we will be in the middle of the debate on the care deficit. This could be the single most difficult issue facing the family in the 21st century. </p> <p>Historically, women were responsible for care within the family. They raised the children and cared for the elderly according to the traditional, early-20th-century model. But the transfer of their labour from the family to the paid economy has opened up a care deficit. That is one part of family life the baby-boomers singularly failed to reinvent. Women are still expected to take on the bulk of the care responsibilities within the family and some research indicates that men (particularly those in professional jobs) are now doing fewer household chores and less childcare than they did 20 years ago. What is fuelling the care deficit is the growing pressure of long hours at work. The number of long-hour workers in the UK has doubled in the past five years to 26% of the workforce. </p> <p>At the moment, the centre of the debate over the care deficit is how to care for children, which is likely to be a major issue at the next general election as demand grows on the state to step in and help families with this part of the care deficit. As birth rates decline dramatically in countries such as Spain and Italy, the European Union will add to the domestic pressure in the UK for the government to adopt family-friendly policies, including state childcare provision and greater encouragement for flexible working. By 2020, it is possible that the childcare question will have been solved - there will be enough provision and the state will ensure it's affordable - but another part of the care deficit, the care of the elderly and chronically ill, will be provoking much greater concern. </p> <p>On every aspect of the care deficit over the coming decades, people will turn to technology for help. Japan, which has the highest proportion of those over 60 in the world, has already pioneered the kind of remote, web-based technology that can administer health checks such as taking a pulse rate and measuring blood pressure. There will be moves to further extend the role of technology in providing care.</p> <p>Webcams might by 2020 be playing the role the telephone did in the 20th century, a vital communication link for families who might live hundreds of miles apart. Already some nurseries are linked up to their parents' office by webcam so they can see their children at play. More and more communication within the family is likely to be mediated by technology - the internet, email or the mobile phone. Already, technology has facilitated the family life of people who have migrated from their home country. For example, a South African nurse working in the UK can now be involved in daily decisions about the upbringing of her children and care of her parents. Involvement in family life no longer requires geographical proximity.</p> <p>Technology will alleviate some of the loneliness arising from the care deficit, but it can offer few solution to the basics of sustaining a person's daily life. There have been suggestions that robots could be programmed to respond to a baby's crying and that they could play a role in the care of tiny babies. But there will be strong cultural reservations about such an idea, reinforced by the emerging research on the importance of affection towards babies in the development of their brains in the first year, so it is hard to see robot nannies being a major feature of family life. </p> <p>The big problem in 2020 will be to find the workforce to meet the care needs of families. It is predicted that by 2020 the US will absorb the entire global workforce of nurses, such will be the demand of its ageing population for medical care. It will be able to offer high enough wages to poach them from all over the world. </p> <p>The declining birth rate in many European countries - Britain's has been declining also but at a slower rate - will post the acute problem of finding enough people to care for their ageing populations. Perhaps governments will finally have to tackle the chronic low pay and low status of care work to recruit sufficient numbers. Or perhaps they will adopt the short-term solution of importing care, allowing women migrant workers on short-term contracts to staff our nurseries, old people's homes and hospitals.</p> <p>We do not yet know. But whatever course policymakers choose, they - and we - face some tough challenges.</p> <p><b>Madeleine Bunting is a Guardian columnist and the author of Willing Slaves: How the Overwork Culture is Ruling Our Lives (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99)</b></p>",
  "<p>Rarely has a question of such great topical import exercised my family quite so vigorously. Never have the relatively inconsequential issues of fox-hunting, Fathers 4 Justice or global warming seemed so superfluous to the grand scheme of things, when what currently matters far more at grassroots level is the very pressing issue - need I remind you? - of choosing a name for the new Blue Peter kitten. The nation waits. It is on tenterhooks. </p> <p>I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that there will be little sleep for a concerned viewing public until the quest to find a suitable moniker for the dear little ginger and white bundle has been resolved. Anyone who doubts that thinking of names for cats is a reasonable subject for national debate should take it up with one of the scores of grateful parents who send up a short prayer to Biddy Baxter every time the opening bars of the Blue Peter theme tune fill the house three times a week at 5pm. </p> <p>In an uncertain world, Blue Peter represents a touchstone of childhood innocence and stability. It exists as a welcome reminder that issues surrounding children aren't solely to do with obesity, drugs, underage pregnancy, precocious makeup-wearing and self-harming. Steadfastly and intelligently, it sticks to a virtually unchanged formula without ever seeming out of touch or stuffy. </p> <p>Pivotal to its success is an anchor team made up of the most wholesome individuals since Mary and Joseph pitched up at Bethlehem. The fact that Liz is currently heavily pregnant is, you feel, as likely to be the result of some sort of divine televisual intervention as any other, more traditional method. Certainly, the thrice-weekly menu, unlike most other, puerile children's shows, is always studiedly free of filth, corruption and innuendo. You know, for instance, that when they include an item on the Braemar Highland Games, there will be no double entendres around the subject of caber-tossing. There will be a blissful absence of salacious sniggering about what may or may not lurk beneath Simon and Matt's kilts. </p> <p>Back in the studio, any instances of demonstrative bottom-nosing on the part of the assembled pets will be tactfully panned over by the camera-man. Most importantly for parents, who these days feel it essential to police afternoon television for signs of violence, smut and plain dim-wittedness, if Blue Peter's on, they know their children won't be watching any of the cookery, DIY or similarly deadly makeover dross on the other channels. </p> <p>And yet, I have to admit that my faith was rocked to the very core last week as I watched, transfixed and a little horrified, as Liz demonstrated how to make a fringed poncho out of a baby's cot blanket. First, I wondered about the wisdom of Blue Peter's \"makes\" section branching out into clothes. Second, it occurred to me that the programme isn't completely blameless when it comes to dumbed-down television. If one were looking to trace the origins of the ceaseless torrent of dire home-improvement shows, the buck would probably stop at Blue Peter's door. </p> <p>Surely it is almost solely responsible for introducing a generation of children to craft techniques, and the creative empowerment that comes with knowing how to use double-sided tape, sticky-backed plastic and a tub of Copydex. For this sort of educative conscientiousness it should be applauded, but who could predict that the same viewers who grew up making father's day gifts out of washing-up liquid bottles, coat hangers and Mum's old pants would, as adults, progress to staple guns, jigsaws and MDF and be deluded enough to think they could apply those same slap-and-paste techniques to their own houses? </p> <p>The horrible moment of truth for many must surely come when they have made an unholy mess of rag-rolling the fireplace surround, only to realise that there isn't a fallback scenario facilitated by \"the one I made earlier\". The harsh lesson is that confident craftwork as a child doesn't necessarily translate into competent adult DIY skills. Just because you once made Sindy's kitchen and Tracy Island out of some old shoe boxes, it doesn't mean similar principles can be employed to tart up the guest room. Likewise cooking. John Noakes's bird cake represented a seminal culinary moment for many children my age. Valerie Singleton's coconut ice inspired a generation of fledgling cooks long before Delia whisked up her first egg white. But although it made us more confident and experimental in the kitchen, it also spawned mouthy gobshites such as Ainsley Harriott, which isn't something to be proud of. </p> <p>This is why I worry about Liz's poncho moment last week. So far, dressmaking is virtually the only gentle leisure pursuit to have escaped the bawdily vacuous TV makeover treatment, possibly dismissed as not sexy enough for telly, too laborious and matronly, with not enough potential for hilarious cock-ups and resulting marital discord. I am glad. For me, sewing is representative of solitary, therapeutic endeavour, and should remain that way. Start making ponchos on Blue Peter and who knows where it will lead? Given that the result of Liz's efforts last week was, perhaps by design, an unequivocal fashion disaster, I have a sneaking suspicion that she is with me on this one.</p>",
  "<p>I'm a journey man, looking for arms at night, 20 years. Circling, London town. You might have seen me? Even got me. In and out, this way and that. I'm a black cab driver chasing his own tail, fishing late into the night with his yellow light burning bright, waiting to be taken into the blue, capture, with the meter running.</p> <p> But wait up; me and my girls are off. We've already got bags. Different sizes for different backs. </p> <p>\"What about school?\" \"'What about there education?\" The \"what abouts\" can stay at home. We haven't told the school yet. I'm going to walk in with a straight back, and clean teeth, like a gun slinger, with his smile. The head's going to be rattling on and on. And I'm going to say. \"Hold up, were off.\" And gently close that door.</p> <p>The girls are going to write journals and see what they see, eyeing different eyes. Swimming with dolphins, watching kick boxing, and stand by the side as Buddhas walk gently past. Beggars and bowlers, old and young. </p> <p>My back's getting yoga, even though when I stretch I fart. We're travel on trains, and the back of trucks watching colours and heat go past with conversation as a friend. Slowly moving in Asia, this way and that, tip toeing feet. Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.</p> <p>Then on to Australia and bloodstone boots. Buying a banger, hitting the dust. Kangaroos to hit, kolas to save. We'll have arguments and tears, but on certain days, we're going to be alive. On to New Zealand, looking at deco and tat, high mountains, clear water and clouds doing their thing. Then over the Pacific, to the land of popcorn bellies and chewing gum where winners take all. Giants of men, Sequoias reaching the sky. Down the coast to Mexico for Spanish, served up as a family dish. We'll learn and go to Spanish school. But we've got a ticking clock, I reckon that's the six months up.</p>",
  "<p>I lay back on the floor of my canoe and looked up at the cloud-studded sky, a fringe of dark green conifers swaying at the edge of my vision. The rise-and-fall hum of a speed boat passed somewhere in the distance. Closing my eyes I waited, and sure enough, the waves of its wake arrived, a liquid echo slapping against the hull of my canoe, rocking me gently into a warm, contented mid-afternoon doze. I allowed myself to feel a little smug. I said it could be done, and here I was, on my long weekend in Canada. Canoe? Check. Fir trees? Check. Glass-flat lake stretching into the distance? Check. Speed boats ... well, we'll get to them later. </p> <p>A long weekend in Canada. To be fair, it's not a sentence you often hear, so I understood why some of my friends looked at me as if I'd lost it. But, I assured them, it isn't as stupid as it sounds. At only six hours away, Toronto is as close as New York, and shoppers and stag parties don't think twice about going there for the weekend. So why not a weekend on the lakes of Ontario, a little shopping for the soul in the Canadian Shield instead of the department stores and boutiques of Manhattan? </p> <p>For the last 150 years, the urbanites of Ontario have been flocking to the shores of the great inland seas that are the Ontario lakes. This is what the Canadians call \"cottage country\" (and yes, what I'm doing is in theory \"cottaging\" as I find out to my surprise when I open the local paper to find an advertisement with two men standing outside a wooden house beneath a banner promising \"The Best of Cottaging\"!) Every weekend throughout the summer months, the highways north and east of Toronto bulk out with SUVs and trucks towing jet skis, speedboats and other watery outdoor stuff as families and couples escape the heat of the city for the swimming, fishing and cool breezes of lake country. Think New York and the Hamptons; only this being Canada, it's a more natural, more egalitarian and more, well, wholesome version of its American counterpart. </p> <p>Boarding my flight for Toronto on the Thursday afternoon (OK, so this is a long, long weekend) I'm sure I can get a slice of this Canadian weekend dream, but by the Friday morning, I'm not so convinced. </p> <p>It started at the airport. The chipper immigration officer asks where I'm going this weekend. \"Georgian Bay Islands national park,\" I proudly tell him. \"Oh, the Park Officers are on strike this weekend,\" he says cheerfully, \"Have a great day now!\" (In Canada, it seems, times and days are \"great\" as opposed to the American \"nice\" ... a significant difference I feel.) Then on Friday there was the drive north out of Toronto, through unpromising flat farming country and sheets of rain supplemented by the vicious backwash of SUV tyres. </p> <p>Things begin to look up, though, once I'm off the highway. The roads become undulating gravel tracks and home-made signs point down even smaller tracks to the rural promises of Getaway Cottage and Lakeside Cabin. My hopes are lifted further as the sun comes out when I arrive at Severn Lodge, a small resort on the eastern shore of Gloucester Pool in the Muskoka-Georgian Bay Lake area. The white-washed wooden main building and cabins are arranged around an inviting little beach beyond which a massive lake stretches into the distance, its taut surface broken by outcrops of fir tree islands. There are canoes on the decking and chipmunks in the undergrowth. \"This is more like it,\" I tell myself. </p> <p>Severn Lodge is typical of many of the small resorts that scatter this area, catering for those who haven't the funds or the time to build their own lakeside cabin. Family- and couple-friendly, Severn Lodge was originally the site of the Georgian Bay Lumber Company before passing into the hands of The Mordolphtons, a private club from Pittsburgh in the 1800s. It became a public resort in the early 1920s. The Lodge is now just a two-hour drive from Toronto, but for the Mordolphtons a weekend here meant a train ride, a steam boat and then an afternoon portaging over the rapids. Sepia photos of club members wearing full length swim suits and rugged smiles adorn the walls of the lodge and while they obviously stare out from a very different time, it is still possible to feel a connection with their hardier age of holidaying here. </p> <p>Waking early the next morning, I opened my cabin door to discover a thin veil of mist hanging just above the dark water. The fir tree islands appeared like outlandish ships adrift, or mountain peaks rising through clouds. There was almost complete silence with just the slow gulp and slap of water under the decking to accompany me as I slipped into the lake. Any worries I might have had about this trip dissolved immediately as I swam out into the mists and floated there on my back, watching a weak sun begin to burn its way through the morning clouds. </p> <p>This illusion of hardy Canadian holiday ing disappeared just as quickly as my worries, though, as a distant whine and a white fin of feathered water signal the arrival of the first water skier of the day. Because - be warned - the downside of having the lakes of Ontario within reach for a weekend is that they're in reach of everyone else, too. Yes, later in the day I get the Canadian canoe experience I'd dreamed of in the plane on the way over, but I do so having to accept that the signature tune of these waters is not the call of the moose or the mating cry of the loon, but rather the distant hum of outboard engines and the screams of adrenaline-hyped Sea-Doo riders. </p> <p>A (slightly) wilder time of it can be had in the Georgian Bay Islands national park. A short drive north to Honey Harbour brings you to the launch point into these 59 islands bought by the Canadian gov ernment in 1929 for \"national purposes\". In 1930, George Lynn, the first park warden, was appointed and charged with turning these remote, lonely islands into a public visiting place while preserving their natural state. It seems George was pretty successful. </p> <p> T The park now boasts the greatest diversity of reptiles and amphibians of any national park in Canada and judging from the stream of boats heading across the choppy waters, it's still pulling in the punters. The camping may be somewhat sanitised (tent shelters, stoves, sinks), but these islands do feel like a real piece of the Canadian wilderness - complete with black bear warning signs. Another sign informs me that the wardens are indeed, as I'd been warned, on strike - but that they've organised themselves so as not to disrupt the working of the park. It would seem this is a very Canadian strike. </p> <p>Walking through the tall forest of Beausoleil island over to Christian Beach on the west coast, I'm accompanied by the whirr of cicadas and a blustery warm wind, both of which feel to have arrived straight from the Mediterranean. I feel as if I'm in Greece or Croatia rather than Ontario. Emerging on to the sand and pebble beach at the end of the trail, however, the view is very much Canadian. White sailed boats and dinghies tack and rock on the ruffled bay against a backdrop of hardwood forest while above them a young osprey tries its wings, escorted by its more graceful parent. </p> <p>This is the type of terrain that first inspired Ontario's Group of Seven \"frontier artists\" in the early 1900s. Travelling through the wilds of Ontario in a converted freight car, the artists formed a new \"outdoor\" aesthetic, \"risking all for the glory of a great adventure\". The groups' favourite symbol, of a lone pine against a glowering sky, became not just a hallmark of their work, but of this entire region. A place where, as they wrote in 1922, \"nature was the measure of a man's stature\". When they visited these islands in Georgian Bay A Y Jackson described their appeal: \"About these harsh and barren islands there is an undeniable fascination, possibly inherent in the manifest struggle recorded in their line, perhaps in the sense of remoteness and stern resistance to the encroachment of man.\" </p> <p>That resistance may have been dented somewhat now, but sitting on the beach with the wind beating on my skin and a low sun striking off the waves, I still felt a sense of what Jackson refers to. And, I realised my long weekend feels just that - long, the hours like days and the days like weeks. To be honest though, as I drive back down into Toronto that evening and the lights of the city rise about me, it still hasn't felt like quite long enough. So, to answer my question at the start of this article: Yes, you can have a long weekend in the Ontario lakes, but if you're able, take a little longer and \"risk all for the glory of a great adventure\". After all with so many \"great days\" to be had, it's a shame to have to rush them. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> </p> <p>Frontier Canada (020-8776 8709, <a href=\"http://www.frontier-travel.co.uk\">frontier-travel.co.uk</a>) offers four nights' self-catering at the Severn Lodge in Ontario's Lakes Cottage Country from \u00a3853pp including Air Canada flights to Toronto and car hire. </p> <p><strong> Further information:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.travelcanada.ca\">travelcanada.ca</a>.

  "<p><strong> South east </strong></p> <p><strong>Goods Shed, Canterbury</strong><br> </p> <p>The huge windows of this converted engine shed let in rays of light that sweep across chunky pine tables on a raised platform. A relaxed buzz from the farmers' market below adds a comforting sense of community and earthy smells of English cheese and fresh produce reassure that the food will be of the best quality. A main course of roast organic chicken with sorrel, chard and potatoes was good. Even better was the vegetable platter, with mushrooms, black lentils, chard, hard-boiled egg, swede, tomato relish and salad leaves. Own-made cinnamon ice-cream had a perfectly creamy taste and texture. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Station Road West, Canterbury, Kent (01227 459153). <br>Mains \u00a38-\u00a316. </p> <p><strong> JSW, Petersfield</strong><br> </p> <p>Jake Watkins has established a gastronomic haven in this picturesque market town. The dining room is minute, and while the decor may not be overly exciting, the food is truly outstanding, and is accompanied by a seriously good and extensive wine list, strong in under-appreciated but noteworthy Alsatian vintages. The excellent value six-course tasting menu is taken from the carte, so on either menu you might enjoy such dishes as roast scallops with pea shoot salad, slow roast belly of pork and Earl Grey tea panna cotta with strawberries. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1 Heath Road, Petersfield, Hampshire (01730 262030). Set lunch from \u00a319.50, dinner from \u00a329.50. </p> <p><strong> Plough, nr Amersham </strong><br> </p> <p>Formerly a pub, the Plough hovers on a sea of turf punctuated by two sentinel bay trees. Fish courses are expertly cooked, and a deep purple blueberry panna cotta with mango sorbet and elderflower escum\u00e9 - foam to you and me - is top-notch. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Hill, Winchmore Hill, nr Amersham, Buckinghamshire (01494 721001). Mains \u00a312.50-\u00a316.95. </p> <p><strong> South west Porthgwidden Beach Restaurant, St Ives</strong><br> </p> <p> This on-the-beach venue has a Moroccan theme, a decor of vibrant desert shades that complement the striking view of white sand and blue sea. Food is impressive: unpretentious and generous. Chicken andaluz was a crowd pleaser, with crisp roast chicken and baked vegetables. The specials board included a sumptuous chocolate and coffee torte for pudding. Wonderful value. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Porthgwidden Beach, St Ives (01736 796791). Mains \u00a35.95-\u00a313.95. Tapas \u00a33-\u00a35. </p> <p><strong> Oyster Shack, Bigbury </strong><br> </p> <p>This goes a long way to providing what people actually want from a restaurant, as opposed to what restaurateurs think their customers want. As many country house hotels face empty tables most weekday lunchtimes, the Oyster Shack is stuffed with punters - you must book regardless of the day. Not bad for a bring-your-own that's little more than a shack with a tarpaulin out front. Of course, the setting's part of the fun but the main draw is the ultra-fresh seafood: pan-fried sardines, potted shrimp, shell-on prawns or whatever the catch of the day might be. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Milburn Orchard Farm, Stakes Hill, Bigbury (01548 810876, <a href=\"http://www.oystershack.co.uk\">oystershack.co.uk</a>). Mains \u00a36.95-\u00a316.95. </p> <p><strong> Midlands</strong></p> <p><strong>Howard Arms, Ilmington </strong><br> </p> <p> This inn-restaurant is textbook perfect. It overlooks a pretty village green, is quaint but airy inside, has a log fire and blackboard menu, and more than enough room to cope with its loyal clientele and passing trade, although best to book in advance. What sets the food apart is the quality of ingredients, the chef who cooks them simply but superbly, and prices that are fairly pitched. The Sunday roast Herefordshire beef was beautifully cooked and came with fresh greens and red cabbage. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lower Green, Ilmington, Warwickshire (01608 682226, <a href=\"http://www.howardarms.com\">howardarms.com</a>). Mains \u00a39.50-\u00a315. </p> <p><strong> The Waterdine, Llanfair Waterdine </strong><br> </p> <p> For the view alone, it would be hard to beat the rear dining room at this 16th-century drovers' inn. Head chef Ken Adams' short, seasonal three-course menu is formed from local ingredients (herbs, vegetables and fruit come from the garden) and imaginative twists on traditional fare. Fillet of brill wrapped in smoked salmon was perfectly done, as was herb risotto with balsamic roast vegetables. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Llanfair Waterdine, Shropshire (01547 528214). Mains \u00a310.50-\u00a316.50. </p> <p><strong> East Anglia </strong></p> <p><strong>Randolph, Southwold</strong><br> </p> <p> Smartly decorated with bold modern colours, this renovated Victorian pub displays a passion or ingredients in their prime. Careful sourcing includes locally smoked salmon that's a must-try, as is beautifully judged line-caught wild sea bass, herb-crusted and served with minted spuds, char- grilled asparagus, warm tomato and basil vinaigrette. You must make room for stem ginger cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, rhubarb compote and lemon shortbread. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Wangford Road, Reydon, Southwold, Suffolk (01502 723603). Mains \u00a315-\u00a317. </p> <p><strong> Three Horseshoes, Warham </strong><br> </p> <p>Would that more pub food were like this: unfussy, fairly priced and cooked with care. Three Horseshoes is a lovely old place with a restful setting in a quiet village. Beer is local. From the blackboard menu by the bar, creamy artichoke soup was followed by a seafood and salmon pie with fish, fresh mussels, cockles and prawns. Equally praiseworthy were the vegetables, the own-made puds and the no-chips policy. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bridge Street, Warham All Saints, Norfolk (01328 710547). Mains \u00a35.80-\u00a38.20. No credit cards. </p> <p><strong>North </strong></p> <p><strong>60 Hope Street, Liverpool</strong><br> </p> <p>Gary Manning's superb front-of-house team and brother Colin's well-travelled suitcase of British-based fusions make a night out a treat. King prawns and Piedmontese peppers, pheasant and cabbage, salmon and risotto and tomato and mozzarella soup indicate a liking for basic Italian ingredients. Service is fast and unfussy, and there's a serious wine list. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 60 Hope Street, Liverpool (0151-707 6060, <a href=\"http://www.60hopestreet.com\">60hopestreet.com</a>). Mains \u00a313.50-\u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Spread Eagle, Sawley </strong><br> </p> <p> Undoubtedly one of Lancashire's best restaurants; the setting of the former 17th-century coaching inn is superb - floors creak, fires crackle and the rest of the world seems a long way away. Food is never short of stunning. Mains feature venison haunch steaks, or seared salmon with gnocchi. A carrot and cashew nut pav\u00e9 was simple but successful - as are the desserts, like the layered chocolate truffle cake. A class act. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sawley, Lancashire (01200 441202, <a href=\"http://www.sawleystudios.co.uk/spreadeagle\">sawleystudios.co.uk/spreadeagle</a>).

The initially austere setting melts away with the arrival of roast duck breast with olive oil and chocolate bonbons or risotto of white onion with espresso and parmesan air. Flinn's inspiration comes directly from El Bulli, the famously avant garde eaterie near Barcelona where Flinn cooked for two seasons. He clearly learned well because everything - from starters of white loaf with fluffy parmesan butter, intensely flavoured roast scallops and a velvet-textured soup of butternut squash, to a main of roast suckling pig and a pudding of chocolate fondant and black sesame seed ice-cream - was just terrific. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 19 Boar Lane, Leeds (0113 2455922). Mains \u00a315.95-\u00a317.95. Set lunch from \u00a318.95. </p> <p><strong> Star Inn, Harome </strong><br> </p> <p> If you want to eat in the Michelin-starred dining room and then stay in the luxury accommodation, you'll need to save up and book early. But if you turn up on spec at pub opening time, you can eat in the old polished oak bar, the best room on the premises. Either way, it's a treat. Feast on Ryedale roe deer, Whitby crab, Fadmoor beetroot with Ragstone goat's cheese, or beef fillet reared on a village farm. For pudding, order baked ginger parkin with rhubarb ripple ice cream and hot spiced treacle. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Harome, North Yorkshire (01439 770397, <a href=\"http://www.thestaratharome.co.uk\">thestaratharome.co.uk</a>).

This Georgian rectory offers not just Michelin-starred dining but excellent bedrooms. Chef/owner Chris Chown works to produce imaginative food from the best local produce. Staff strike a balance between informality and efficiency; the dining room is simple but stylish. Starters include soups such as watercress with nutmeg glaze or ballotine of guinea fowl, apricot and pistachio and red pepper chutney. The monkfish and Carmarthen ham has become a national standard. Welsh lamb and beef are also well represented. Booking is essential. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nefyn Road, Pwllheli, Gwynedd (01758 612363, <a href=\"http://www.bodegroes.co.uk\">bodegroes.co.uk</a>.

The confident pink facade of this wonderful Michelin-starred restaurant with rooms stands out from its more sober neighbours. Mary Ann Gilchrist's cooking is extraordinary on a number of levels. First, she is self-taught. Second, she runs the kitchen single-handed while husband Alan deals with wine and front of house. Third, the standard of food is consistently high. Modern British in style, there are French influences aplenty. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dolecoed Road, Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys (01591 610248, <a href=\"http://www.carltonrestaurant.co.uk\">carltonrestaurant.co.uk</a>).

Set lunch/dinner from \u00a319.95. </p> <p><strong> Northern Ireland</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Cayenne, Belfast</strong> </p> <p>The flagship of Paul Rankin's expanding empire delivers an uplifting flight from the ordinary. Try saffron risotto (with clams, chorizo and borlotti beans), char-grilled veal sweet breads (with balsamic lentils, rocket and crispy pancetta), and orange cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (with kumquat compote and hazelnut biscotti). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 7 Ascot House, Shaftesbury Square, Belfast (028-9033 1532, <a href=\"http://www.cayennerestaurant.com\">cayennerestaurant.com</a>).

Set lunch/dinner from \u00a312. </p> <p><strong> Scotland Silver Darling Seafood, Aberdeen </strong><br> </p> <p>Didier Dejeans' French seafood restaurant at the entrance to Aberdeen harbour goes from strength to strength. In 2003, a ground-floor oyster bar was added: neat, small and modern with a more informal approach (moules, steak fr\u00eetes). It only opens in summer and has tables outside for those days sufficiently warm to offset the North Sea breeze. Meanwhile, the main conservatory-style dining room upstairs provides perhaps the best food in the city. Three serious courses like woodland mushroom and langoustine minestrone with mascarpone dumplings and truffle oil to start; pan-fried medallions of monkfish with squid, spinach, fish roe and squid ink sauce as a main; then filo layers filled with cinnamon-flavoured pear, maple sauce and pecan nuts for dessert. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Pocra Quay, North Pier, Aberdeen (01224 576229). Mains \u00a318-\u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Off the Wall, Edinburgh</strong><br> </p> <p> A blessed counterpoint to all the tartan shops and backpacker hostels of the Royal Mile. It has understated, contemporary decor, and a solid reputation for its menu. All meat, game and seafood come from Scottish sources, but the style leans towards France. A great restaurant - and it still feels wonderfully discreet despite the location. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 105 High Street, Edinburgh (0131-558 1497, <a href=\"http://www.off-the-wall.co.uk\">off-the-wall.co.uk</a>).

  "The Chechen separatist leader, Aslan Maskhadov, tried to distance himself from extremists in the independence movement yesterday by declaring that his former commander-in-chief Shamil Basayev would one day stand trial for ordering the Beslan school siege. <p>The Kremlin has said that both Mr Maskhadov and Mr Basayev ordered the siege, in which more than 300 people, half of them children, were killed. </p> <p>It has put \u00a35.5m bounties on their heads. </p> <p>But while Mr Basayev has claimed responsibility for the attack, Mr Maskhadov has condemned it and promised yesterday to punish those behind such \"illegal acts\". </p> <p>In a statement on the website <a href=\"http//:www.chechenpress.com&quot;\">chechenpress.com</a>, Mr Maskhadov again condemned the siege. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately in the conditions of the current ongoing war, the trial of those responsible for the recent terrorist acts is practically impossible,\" he said. </p> <p>\"At the same time I declare that at the end of the military phase the guilty will be taken to court, including Shamil Basayev.\" </p> <p>Mr Maskhadov has long struggled to rein in Mr Basayev; he reportedly made him his commander-in-chief in August 2002 to quieten the resistance before peace talks. </p> <p>Yet since the Moscow theatre siege in October of that year, Mr Basayev has taken the lead in organising attacks against Russian civilians. </p> <p>Reports surfaced yesterday of heightened militant resistance in Chechnya. </p> <p>Russia's counter-terrorism headquarters in the Chechen republic said yesterday that both men had been involved in planning the Beslan atrocity. </p> <p>Mr Basayev and his Arab mercenaries, they said, were hiding behind Mr Maskha-dov's independence movement to legitimise their plan of creating an \"Arab caliphate in the north Caucasus\". </p> <p>The claims came as the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called on the UN in New York to create a new list of terrorists and their supporters to simplify extradition and asset-freezing procedures. </p> <p>An official from the FSB, the Russian security services, said the list would probably contain the names of Akhmed Zakayev, Mr Maskhadov's spokesman, who was granted political asylum by the UK and lives in London. </p> <p>The former Chechen foreign minister Ilyas Akhmadov, who was given asylum by the US, and Mr Maskhadov would also be on it, said the official. </p> <p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, appealed to the media yesterday to modify their coverage of terrorist attacks, while apparently rejecting the idea of government restrictions. </p> <p>He told a conference of news agencies: \"It is obvious that the struggle against terrorism cannot be an excuse to infringe upon the freedom and independence of the press. </p> <p>\"But you yourselves, as professionals, should develop a model of work that would allow media to become an effective instrument in the struggle against terror.\" </p> <p>The Russian parliament rejected a bill to ban all television and radio coverage of hostages crises until they had been resolved. </p> <p>Some MPs argued that media coverage had helped terrorists by conveying the horror of their actions.</p>",
  "<p>The other week I mentioned the Great Ice Cream Cone Debate, in which a newspaper columnist took issue with an American claim that the edible ice cream cone made its appearance at the 1904 World Fair in St Louis. He was quite right to do so: according to James Trager's The Food Chronology, the man responsible for the American entrant was an immigrant Syrian pastry maker, Ernest A Hamwi, and he called them 'cornucopias'. Trager adds, however, that the patent was issued earlier in the year to an Italian immigrant, Italo Marchiony, who claimed to have been making them since 1896. But, as Robin Weir, our own ice cream guru, has pointed out, the great Mrs Marshall came up with a recipe for this world-changing invention in 1886. </p> <p>That said, Weir is indefatigable in his search for the truth when it comes to ice cream, and his latest piece of ice cream archaeology has revealed that even Marshall was not as original as we all thought. He has traced ice cream cones made by an Italian in Paris in 1807, almost 100 years before the American upstart. </p> <p>So, while the cone clearly was not invented in America, I acknowledge that it has produced the finest poem on the subject, Tableau At Twilight, by Ogden Nash, which begins, 'I sit in the dusk. I am all alone./Enter a child with an ice cream cone./A parent is easily beguiled/By sight of this coniferous child', and goes on to explore the domestic implications of children, ice cream and cones. </p> <p>All this may not seem quite as momentous as, say, the discovery of the DNA double helix, but it is not without its significance. I'm sure the debate will not rest there, so if anyone can cast more light on this matter, please let me know.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> 020-7407 2985<br><strong>Address:</strong> 87 Tower Bridge Road, London SE1</p> <p>Long, long ago, back in the days when Danniella Westbrook's nostrils hadn't yet got divorced, when sausages weren't 80% bread, 17% fat and 2% eyelid (don't ask about the other 1%), and when high court judges were assuring us that Mary Archer was fragrant, that Robert Maxwell was honest and that Liberace wasn't homosexual, the merry tinkle of a Wall's ice-cream van approaching the neighbourhood was a sure sign that the outside temperature must have plummeted to minus 3. </p> <p>\"Stop me and buy one\" was the Wall's motto, and my favoured purchase was always their Zoom ice lolly, which came in three flavours (red flavour, blue flavour and yellow flavour), unless you were colour-blind, in which case there was only one flavour. Incidentally, although the Wall's name has become synonymous with lollies and ices, the company actually started out in Victorian times in the sausage and pie business, hence (I suppose) the expression: \"Walls have ears.\" Damn and blast. Now you know what was in the other 1%. </p> <p>Many of the Italian families who migrated to London in the 19th century did a reverse-Wall's, by opening ice-cream stores that eventually transmogrified into pie shops. Honest east London folk were confident that nothing untoward would be lurking in their low-priced mince pies (ironically, cockney rhyming slang for \"eyes\"), and a century later these establishments still exude that same air of thrift and unpretentious reliability. A friend in Walthamstow introduced me to these underappreciated treasures many years ago, when he took me to the Wood Street Pie and Mash Shop (they're always \"shops\", never \"restaurants\" or \"cafes\"), and I've been on the lookout for them ever since, especially in the east and south of the capital. Well, they're something of a cock-er-ney tradition in those parts, like visiting the Blind Beggar (commonly known as \"the Tardis pub\", because there must be at least a million East Enders who all claim to have been drinking there the night that Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell). </p> <p>The oldest surviving example of a pie and eel shop is the wondrous Manze's in Tower Bridge Road, which has barely changed since it opened in 1891. (How many shops, cafes or restaurants could make that boast?) This family business has other outlets in Peckham, Deptford and Chapel Market, but this is the holy grail for aficionados, with quaint tiled surroundings, white marble tables, ornate mirrors and hard, narrow wooden benches that play havoc with your Chalfonts (St Giles = piles) and were clearly designed with the emaciated, toasted-whippet physique of the Victorian worker in mind. There's a pre-first world war schoolroom feel to the interior, which may explain why half of the clientele it attracted while I was there were astonishingly elderly types who resembled extras from a Fellini film (one with so many missing teeth that his tongue looked as though it was in jail), gratefully sucking stewed eel off the bone. And the other half? Tourists seeking out authentic London experiences, along with pinstriped City types, price-conscious office workers and a couple of loud and self-important merchant bankers (I forget what they're rhyming slang for). </p> <p>The recipe for the pies is a closely guarded family secret, but I'd bet my testicles that they're made with cold water pastry and baked in the traditional style. As with the best feu de bois-cooked pizzas, the perfect meat pie should be slightly burnt on the outside and slightly doughy on the inside, to the point that the uninitiated might think that it should have been cooked for longer at a lower temperature. Served with lumpy mashed potato and parsley liquor (a green sauce based on a crude, floury roux), the contrast in flavours and textures is always a winner: burnt pastry, soggy pastry, stewed minced meat, all doused in bland liquor, cut through with chilli vinegar and copious amounts of the spice that spawned a famous cockney joke: </p> <p>\"I have an orgasm every time I sneeze.\" </p> <p>\"Really? What do you take for it?\" </p> <p>\"White pepper.\" </p> <p>Eaten in situ with a fork and spoon (hold the food down with the former, cut it with the latter), pie and mash is best consumed on a cold day with the windows steamed up, but it's delicious in summer, too. True, it polarises (unenlightened friends head for the hills), but if you've never tried it, then do so soon, because these unassuming and ludicrously low-priced shops are rapidly dying out (I blame soaring rents and gastronomic snobbery) at the rate of one a year. The only trouble with them is that I've only just started in this job and I'm already becoming a fat bastard, as was brought home to me forcefully when I struggled to extricate myself from the narrow bench table, having just consumed an order of double pie and triple mash, and left the premises high on carbs, filled with self-loathing. I've let Dr Atkins down, I've let you down and, most of all, I've let myself down.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Price:</strong> \u00a36 for two, including Tizer. <br><strong>Open:</strong> Lunch only, Monday-Saturday. <br>Wheelchair users can and do eat here (there's a slight, easily negotiated incline at the door).

  "<p>In the early 1970s, the supremely self-confident apartheid machine in South Africa set out to control all aspects of the lives of black people; it would determine where we could live, work, study, play, be treated when ill and buried when dead; even who we could love. Worst of all, it tried to make the oppressed complicit in their own repression; over and over, we were taught that black culture was crude and backward, rooted in archaic tribalism and ethnic division. Apartheid ideologues held that the concept of a black identity was a myth. \"Non-white\" South Africans comprised of disparate tribes and races - Zulu, Xhosa, Indian, Coloured, and so forth - were bound to destroy each other if the white man disappeared.</p> <p>But brutal repression, however beguiling its justification, inevitably invites reaction. Something had to give. Soon, the cycles of black revolt and white repression began. It did not require great vision to recognise that the struggle would be long and brutal - it lasted another 20 years - and that it would be fought on every terrain: military, economic, and, yes, cultural.</p> <p>About 20 of us got together and started a writers' group called Black Thoughts; we were determined to be part of the \"revolution\" we could see unfolding. Our self-assigned role was to correct the cultural distortions that apartheid was imposing on us. \"Civilisation\" was by definition not only western, but European, and civilised discourse could only properly take place in languages of European origin.</p> <p>At school, black students were forced to receive instruction in Afrikaans; English was relegated to a third language, and learners would be exposed to it only through the \"classics\". Shakespeare (except for Othello), Hardy, Dickens, Mark Twain, and so forth; worthy as they were in their own right, these were not African writers - looking for an African writer, our \"masters\" turned to H Rider Haggard.</p> <p>The Black Thoughts collective would correct that. Africa was emerging from colonialism, however falteringly, and, through its writers, we resolved to bring it to township audiences: small groups of students, civic activists, trade unionists, church congregations, anyone who would listen to us. We would infuse a new sense of pride in black people, even the informers who followed us everywhere, reporting with enforced zeal on those amateur troubadour events.</p> <p>The atmosphere was charged with romantic, clandestine energy; lookouts watched out for the police and upon a whistled warning a fiery poetry recital would quickly subside into the Lord's Prayer. It was at such a gathering that I first suffered my crisis of literary identity. I saw myself as a black writer, and indeed, an African writer. Yet it soon became apparent that what I was writing and reading out loud - poems and stories set in the city, in the dusty township, trying to find beauty in dimly lit streets and the hard echo of asphalt - was vastly dissonant from what most of my compatriots were presenting.</p> <p>Africa, it seemed, was the savannah, \"the silence of fatherly mountains and the slow grace of brown rivers\". At its heart was the idyllic, peaceful village, ruled over by grey-bearded sages endowed with an ancient, yet practical wisdom. In contrast, the city was transiently evil, a gigantic asphalt salt mine into which Africans had been thrust after imperial Europe had wrenched them from their rural innocence. Uhuru, freedom on African terms, essentially meant being able to leave the urban Sodom and return to the almost mythical rural refuge. This remained true even after the white usurper was forced out, ceding his privileged place to the black neo-colonialist.</p> <p>As Munira, a character in Ngugi's landmark novel of post-colonial disillusion and dissent, Petals of Blood, says as he leaves the city of Limuru to return to the remote village of Il morog: \"I wanted to go deep into the country where I would have no reminder of so bitter a betrayal.\"</p> <p>My Black Thoughts compatriots did not proclaim their yearning for this tranquil pastoral alternative as explicitly as did Ngugi, nor did they take on any of the sentimental tones of Leopold Senghor's early \"Negritude\" poetry.</p> <p>In the subtle rhythms of stories and poems, village-bred wisdom offered migrant workers salvation from the metropolis and its attendant white man's vices: fast women, alcohol, gambling dens and of course the thugs - tsotsis - that robbed those naive innocents of their dignity and their meagre, hard-earned \"wealth\".</p> <p>Most important of all, each one of my fellow writers had an authentic rural reference point, a village he or she may never have seen but that lived on in the family's anthology of moral tales.</p> <p>The closest I came to a country place to identify with was an uncle's small-holding on a deserted back road to Botswana. But it was a dark and narrow place and no haven at all. Because of its proximity to the border, it was \"being observed\" by the army and our canny relative soon discouraged \"known\" young people like me from visiting.</p> <p>Black Thoughts eventually disintegrated. Some of us were banned, others went into exile, some settled down to ordinary lives (normality was another enduring myth). Yet, as a writer, I persisted for some years in trying to capture that elusive pastoral serenity. It remained a lovely texture in my imagination, but I could not give it the meaningful life of words it deserved.</p> <p>Over the years my guilt diminished and I returned to the more familiar milieu of built-up places, of buildings that lean into each other, light falling sharply on darkened alleyways, avenues that flow with the slow grace of rivers. New York, where I have lived for the past few years, has been a wonderful haven.</p> <p>I have also observed with some relief how other African writers have taken to the streets, as it were. Yvonne Vera beautifully evokes Bulawayo in her novel The Stone Virgins, Moses Isegawa's depiction of Idi Amin's Kampala in Snakepit is heady yet claustrophobic. Zakes Mda's Ways of Dying accurately captures the sprawling, elegiac architecture of peri-urban South Africa. African writers are starting to reclaim the African city from the colonialists who by their association with it had poisoned it as a centre of culture and \"dark, gleaming light\".</p> <p>African literature can only be enriched by this.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bitter Fruit by Achmat Dangor is published by Atlantic Books.

  "<p>On September 25 last year, I was sitting at the kitchen table trying to write an essay on Camus's La Peste. In order to analyse a pattern of words in it, I opened Edward Said's Culture and Imperialism, which has an incisive chapter on Camus. I'd read it several times -most recently at Columbia University where I'd taught during the previous year in the same English faculty as Said, and discussed Camus and many other authors with him. Said criticises Camus's plain style, his \"extraordinarily belated, in some ways incapacitated colonial sensibility\", and his declaration that an Algerian nation never existed.</p> <p>I wanted to link this to the way Camus plays on the French word but (target, goal), when the phone rang - it was a friend from Columbia telling me that Edward Said had died that morning. It was very distressing and also uncanny - I could see his words on the page in front of me, hear his voice in their cadences alongside the voice of my friend telling me how Edward had slipped into a coma the previous night and died in the early hours. Ten minutes later I was on the phone to a friend of Edward's and mine in Israel - the three of us had last met one long summer's evening in a country garden outside Stratford-on-Avon three months before - and we reflected on how grief is compulsive in its need to share memories and stories. Then, some time later, I went back to Said's writings to remember him and write about the epic intellectual endeavour that was at the centre of his life.</p> <p>In 1988 he came to London for the launch in the National Theatre of his pamphlet, Yeats and Decolonisation, which had been commissioned by the Derry-based Field Day Theatre Company, of which I was a member. I met him there and we immediately became friends - our conversation, I recall, was mostly about Gerard Manley Hopkins, whose poetry fascinated us both. Three years later, he was diagnosed with the debilitating form of leukaemia he fought for the last 12 years of his life, enduring every month the most terribly painful treatment. He never gave in, and I remember trying to persuade him not to travel to Spain in August last year, because his health was so bad. \"I want to go,\" he said, \"I'm going to make a film with Daniel [Barenboim].\" So he flew to Spain and took part in the film with Barenboim and the young Arab and Israeli musicians of the East-West Divan Orchestra, which was shown on the South Bank Show last winter.</p> <p>Said was born in Jerusalem in 1935, and educated at Victoria College, Cairo (Omar Sharif and Ralph Nader were fellow pupils). During his rebellious adolescence, his father, a successful businessman, sent him to a boarding school in Massachusetts. He survived the displacement and culture shock to become a brilliant student at Princeton and Harvard. He became a professor at Columbia in 1963, and succeeded to Lionel Trilling's chair there. His major work, Orientalism, was published in 1978, and made him world famous. It was translated into 36 languages, and continues to prompt debate and inform argument against certain ideological and racist attitudes that still shape ideology in the United States and Britain.</p> <p>For many people, academic works exist outside politics and history but, as Said shows, generations of scholars have shaped and lent credence to imperialist expansion. In a new introduction to Orientalism, written a few months before he died, Said states that among the major influences on George W Bush's Pentagon and national security council were \"experts on the Arab and Islamic world\" such as Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami who helped the American hawks to think about such \"preposterous phenomena\" as the Arab mind and \"centuries-old Islamic decline\" that only American power could reverse. For Said, the role of the intellectual was to \"say truth to power\", and it was this Promethean truth-telling that drove him tirelessly, ceaselessly until his death. He was attacked in print, received death-threats, had his office at Columbia vandalised, was libelled and dubbed \"the professor of terror\" - he was also attacked for wearing stylish clothes and living in Manhattan - but he refused to stop telling the truth or to stop arguing for peaceful progress towards institutions in Israel and Palestine that were not ethnically based. The solidarity he proclaimed was multi-racial, and he rejoiced in an enormous circle of friends that stretched across the world.</p> <p>Although his many enemies attacked him as an ideologically driven writer, the foundation of all his work is the concept of disinterested aesthetic pleasure. Like Hazlitt, whom he greatly admired, he refused to allow his political principles to distort his admiration for particular works of art. When Culture and Imperialism was published in 1993, the chapter on Jane Austen's Mansfield Park aroused anger among some critics, because of his discussion of the \"dead silence\" (Austen's phrase) that occurs when its heroine, Fanny Price, asks her uncle about the slave trade. The family owns a sugar plantation on Antigua, and Fanny is troubled by this, though to no real narrative purpose (the film in which Harold Pinter plays Fanny's uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, draws on Said's discussion to make the point more sharply).</p> <p>Discussing the novel, Said argues that it is silly \"to expect Jane Austen to treat slavery with anything like the passion of an abolitionist or a newly liberated slave\". Said refused to engage in what he termed \"the rhetoric of blame\", and attack Austen retrospectively for being \"white, insensitive, complicit\". Rather, he criticised card-carrying postcolonial critics for such attacks, and insisted that Austen's novel is a \"rich work\" whose \"aesthetic intellectual complexity\" requires a longer and slower analysis. Austen belonged to a slave-owning society, but we should not therefore jettison her novels as \"aesthetic frumpery\". This affirmation of aesthetic pleasure, which is the central energy of all his writing, is made again in Culture and Imperialism, where he says that Kipling should not be dismissed as an \"imperialist minstrel\". Kim is a work of \"great aesthetic merit\", and cannot be dismissed as the racist imaginings of one \"disturbed and ultra-reactionary imperialist\". Almost uniquely, Said combines an unrelenting appreciation of a literary text or a piece of music with the pizzazz and ethical witness of what that great Puritan writer Samuel Richardson called \"writing to the moment\".</p> <p>Said didn't begin his academic career as a politicised writer, and anyone reading his first book, Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography, would be hard put to detect a political subtext. Only a short passage on the tragedy of Polish history and on \"doubleness\" glances at a political theme. The Conrad book was published in 1966, but the Arab-Israeli war the following year affected Said deeply, and he began to combine political writing with literary criticism and scholarly research. It was this ability to move from discussing a sonnet by Mallarm\u00e9 to indicting the Israeli authorities and their supporters in Europe and the US that was to make Said into what one scholar has called \"probably the best-known intellectual in the world\". Like Mallarm\u00e9, he had read all the books, and it is one of the daunting pleasures of his work to be given reading lists - Auerbach, Adorno, Blackmur, Derrida, Foucault, Lukacs, Vico, whom he had read in depth, as well as a host of other critics, scholars, historians, musicologists. A brilliant linguist who was also a gifted pianist, and in his last years a devoted friend and collaborator with Barenboim, he wrote and lectured and broadcast with the rapt inspiring delight and joy of a great performer.</p> <p>One of his heroes was that supreme Tory anarchist, Jonathan Swift, whom he praises in an essay, \"Humanism's Sphere\", written in the last months of his life. He saw Swift, as Yeats did, as the most \"demonic and tigerish writer as has ever lived\". Swift did not settle into untroubled patterns of tranquillity and unchanging order - instead he remained \"unsatisfied, unappeased, unreconciled\".</p> <p>Said's death, in his 68th year, was untimely, and it is the theme of untimeliness which he confronts in another, posthumously published essay, \"Thoughts on Late Style\", where he challenges the received idea that old age confers a spirit of reconciliation and serenity on late works, and argues that in late Beethoven and Ibsen there is instead \"intransigence, difficulty and contradiction\". The word \"intransigence\" is a favourite with him (sometimes he gives the Arabic sumud), and it informs his writing without ever making it seem rigid, narrow or obsessive. Like his friend, Noam Chomsky, he takes issue with the separation of politics from art and scholarship, and he also draws on Barthes and Foucault, on whose work he was an expert, to argue against the platonic view of an author or, say, a novel as set apart from history and circumstance.</p> <p>This rejection of the separation of history from culture can be seen in The Question of Palestine, which was published in 1979, a year after Orientalism. After discussing the demolition of more than 16,000 Arab houses during the early years of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, which began in 1967, he turns to the moment some 50 years before, when the British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, issued a declaration in which the British government undertook to \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p> <p>In this powerful, always gracefully written polemic, we see several important themes emerging. One is the failure of western intellectuals to recognise how the Palestinian people were made invisible: \"Check the disgraceful record and you will find only a small handful - among them Noam Chomsky, Israel Shahak, IF Stone, Elmer Berger, Judah Magnes - who have tried to see what Zionism did to the Palestinians not just once in 1948, but over the years. It is one of the most frightening cultural episodes of the 20th century, this almost total silence about Zionism's doctrines for and treatment of the native Palestinians.\"</p> <p>Said celebrates the work of certain contemporary intellectuals, who were often dear personal friends, like Chomsky and Shahak. His work brings the life of the mind and high culture to the struggle for justice and recognition. This struggle is pitched against powerful forces - vested interests, embedded ideologies, racism, and those so-called intellectuals whom, quoting Gramsci, he characterised as \"experts in legitimisation\" - the paid scribes of power who are silent about its excesses.</p> <p>We don't tend to see critical writing as performance - at least not those of us who were brought up on the lumpy writings of FR Leavis. But Said's prose, unlike Leavis's, always sings, and has epic, bravura moments, like this immense sentence from the opening chapter of Orientalism :</p> <p>\"To restore a region from its present barbarism to its former classical greatness; to instruct (for its own benefit) the Orient in the ways of the modern West; to subordinate or underplay military power in order to aggrandise the project of glorious knowledge acquired in the process of political domination of the Orient; to formulate the Orient, to give it shape, identity, definition with full recognition of its place in memory, its importance to imperial strategy, and its \"natural\" role as an appendage to Europe; to dignify all the knowledge collected during colonial occupation with the title \"contribution to modern learning\", when the natives had neither been consulted not treated as anything except as pretexts for a text whose usefulness was not to the natives; to feel oneself as a European in command, almost at will, of Oriental history, time, and geography; to institute new areas of specialisation; to establish new disciplines; to divide, deploy, schematise, tabulate, index, and record everything in sight (and out of sight); to make out of every observable detail a generalisation and out of every generalisation an immutable law about the Oriental nature, temperament, mentality, custom, or type; and, above all, to transmute living reality into the stuff of texts, to possess (or think one possesses) actuality mainly because nothing in the Orient seems to resist one's powers: these are the features of Orientalist projection entirely realised in the Description de l'\u00c9gypte, itself enabled and reinforced by Napoleon's wholly Orientalist engulfment of Egypt by the instruments of Western knowledge and power.\"</p> <p>Again, this is like one of those magnificent moments in Hazlitt, where he will suddenly unleash vast sentences which assume an unchallengeable authority and take written prose into the living flow of intense oratory (as everyone who attended his lectures knows, Said was a wonderfully inspired and inspiring speaker).</p> <p>It's unusual for critical prose to be submitted to any kind of formal analysis; indeed, if we survey literary criticism we'll find few discussions of the prose style of novelists, let alone critics, but it is one of the joys of reading Said that we are prompted to examine his formal strategies. He dislikes what, discussing the distinguished Orientalist Hamilton Gibb, he called \"quietly heedless but profoundly sequential prose\". Said breaks with such prose by using parentheses in the long sentence I've just quoted, introducing a pause and change in vocal rhythm which acts as a counterpoint. He had a strong interest in the contrapuntal, noting it in the music he admired, and characterising it as essential to the practice of criticism. This effect is extended by the three stressed nouns \"shape\", \"identity\", \"definition\", and by those six, again strongly stressed verbs, \"divide\", \"deploy\", \"schematise\", \"tabulate\", \"index\", \"read\". Said's prose gives character to the arguments of the Orientalist scholars, travellers, members of government think tanks, whom he then confronts and challenges.</p> <p>His ambition is to prevent sentences from becoming routine, tranquil, unchanging, and his use of dashes and parentheses helps to shape the vocal inflections and pauses of his prose, and to assist a quick passionate intelligence, which knows that often abstract vocabulary, which critical discourse necessarily demands, could dull the prose.</p> <p>Conrad, like Swift, is a conservative anarchist and a major influence on Said, and it is this openness to a point of view that is other than progressive which gives Said's thinking and his style its complexity. In a passage from Heart of Darkness, Conrad offers this seminal image of western imperialism:</p> <p>'Near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a pen-holder behind his ear ... His appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser's dummy; but in the great demoralisation of the land he kept up his appearance. That's backbone.'</p> <p>This passage and Conrad's whole novella, which also influenced TS Eliot, particularly in The Waste Land, is near the centre of Said's imagination, and helps shape his writing.</p> <p>Part of the effectiveness of Said's analysis stems from his attention to Orientalist prose style. Gibb speaks of \"the characteristic difference in the Oriental\". But what is the meaning of \"difference\", Said asks, when the preposition \"from\" has dropped from sight altogether? Said argues that Camus's \"plain style and unadorned reporting\" conceal complex contradictions. In \"Reflections on Exile\", he says that a plain reportorial style can \"coerce\" history and knowledge into \"mere events being observed\". Out of this has grown the eye-witness, seemingly opinion-less politics of contemporary western journalism.</p> <p>The cadences of Said's prose resist the consistency of plain style, as when he argues that the intellectual must choose \"the method, the style, the texture\" best suited for the purpose of saying the truth to power. The texture of his prose challenges that blurred, evasive, timid judiciousness which lies at the heart of much academic writing. His prose is pitched against what he calls \"the academic flaccidity\" of English Studies, the determination of its practitioners to show themselves \"to be silent, perhaps incompetent\" about the social and historical world.</p> <p>Here, we return to the subject of silence, and in Orientalism he explores how a liberal, progressive confidence in civilisation sought to denigrate the achievements of other civilisations. This confidence is enshrined in a famous minute on Indian education, written by Macaulay for the East India Company in 1832, which Said discusses early in Orientalism.</p> <p>Macaulay admitted he had \"no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic\", but went on to assert: \"The intrinsic superiority of the western literature is indeed fully admitted by those members of the committee who support the oriental plan of education ... It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools in England.\"</p> <p>As Said remarks, this is no \"mere expression\" of an opinion, because Macaulay has an ethnocentric opinion with ascertainable results: speaking from a position of power he was able to make an entire subcontinent submit to studying in a language not its own. It was reading Said on Macaulay and then reading the complete minute that made me realise that the beautiful standard English RK Narayan employs in his subtle novels is pitched at such a perfect level - a level with no vernacular resonance - that it reads, with a deliberate irony, as though it is translated from Narayan's native Tamil. Narayan, I remember, was attacked by VS Naipaul, and from time to time Said criticises Naipaul as a writer who tells western power what it wants to hear about its former colonies. He is \"a sensibility on tour\". For Said, the yeast of culture, as Louis MacNeice phrased it, is debate and argument - his address as a lecturer was never shrill or monologic, and the same is true of his written prose.</p> <p>Looking at the legacy of critical theory, which had challenged traditional critical assumptions, his conclusion in the early 1980s was that oppositional Left criticism contributed very little to debate in the culture. Though he lectured to packed audiences throughout the world, and though he had many followers and admirers, I think he always felt that too many people were evasive, too concerned with making careers and with not giving offence. Many liberals had made common cause with the ANC and criticised the apartheid state of South Africa, but they turned their backs on the Palestinians. It's here that we can begin to see the grief and anguish that informs his writing, as he details the \"vulgarities\" of the White House ceremony where Arafat and Rabin made a hopeless doomed peace in 1993. He discusses this humiliating ceremony in Peace and its Discontents (1996), where he speaks of the \"shabby, undemocratic Palestinian Protectorate\" over which Arafat still presides.</p> <p>Said's frustration with Arafat is discussed in the introduction to The Politics of Dispossession (1995), where he discusses the shaping influence he very nearly had on the Camp David agreements of 1978. He felt the Palestinian position was \"extraordinarily rigid\", and along with others who had contacts in the Carter administration, made an effort to make it more flexible. Through his old friend and college classmate, Hodding Carter, who was then assistant secretary of state in Jimmy Carter's administration, he met the secretary of state, Cyrus Vance. That year Said had become a member of the Palestinian National Council (he was never a member of the PLO). Without mentioning his predecessor, Henry Kissinger, Vance made it clear he was trying to shake off the \"hobbles\" that had been placed on the process. The way was now open to a direct dialogue between the PLO and the United States. A message was sent to Arafat, he received it, but nothing happened.</p> <p>The Carter administration gave Said a document agreeing the text of the statement the PLO would issue to get US recognition. Said flew with it to Beirut. He met Arafat around midnight the same day, but the discussion was inconclusive and confused; they met the following midnight and Arafat and his advisers rejected the American offer. Deeply disappointed, Said returned to New York and conveyed the refusal to Vance. The PLO went on to make many more mistakes, which Said details, and the result eventually was the hopeless Oslo agreement, and its sequel Oslo Two. The PLO became more and more bureaucratic, as wealthy Arab governments and states stopped funding it, and still Arafat blustered \"we are on the threshold of a state\".</p> <p>The story of Said's attempt to influence the PLO and shape a settlement is a haunting missed opportunity, and it stayed with him for the rest of his life. In The End of the Peace Process (2000), Said concluded that Oslo Two gave the Palestinian Authority the \"trappings and appurtenances\" of rule without the reality. Like a defeated figure in one of Baudelaire's Spleen poems, Arafat and his people \"rule over a kingdom of illusions, with Israel firmly in command\". The genius of Said's prose, his passionate communicativeness, the warmth and love and marvellous wit of his conversation - captured in print and on film - survive his untimely death. Reading him, talking to him, listening to him lecture, watching him take questions after a lecture or in a seminar, I was inescapably reminded of how Milton characterises Abdiel and the Archangel Michael in Paradise Lost as immortal forces who have the courage to dissent and try to build what Milton calls \"the great place now of light\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tom Paulin will speak at a conference on Edward Said to be held at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, on October 3.

  "Is it possible to combine a free-enterprise economy with the serious pursuit of equality? This is the question that Labour strategists might find hard to avoid as they gather in Brighton searching for a third-term \"big idea\". The traditional Labour answer was always no. The real gulf, it argued, was not between rich and poor, but between \"workers by hand and brain\" and the owners of the means of production. There could be no meaningful progress towards equality while the commanding heights of the economy remained in private hands. <p>New Labour did away with all that. Clause 4 was dropped, while Tony Blair declared it was never a burning ambition \"to make sure that David Beckham earns less money\". But it did not do away with questions about equality. And as the latest report from the Institute for Public Policy Research reveals, in the past two decades the richest 1% has seen its share of total income double from 6.5% to 13%. Finding progressive answers to the stark iniquities of a market economy is surely what a third term should be about. And some powerful solutions can be found in the Labour party's pre-history. </p> <p>In its earlier years, New Labour could avoid talking about strategies for reducing inequality. With the collapse of communism, it was widely agreed that Clause 4 could no longer be defended. Socialised economies had, it seemed, only exchanged one form of inequality for another, at the cost of mounting inefficiency and stagnation. In the 1997 election it was sufficient that Labour possessed a strong leadership and had accepted Mrs Thatcher's destruction of the politics of collectivism and class. The most important thing about Blair's party was that it was not \"old Labour\". In 2001 as well, little was said. A prosperous economy, sound financial management and Tory disarray were enough to secure a landslide victory. </p> <p>This time, Labour may have to be more specific. The problem is not middle England, which has shown little sign of reverting to the Tories, but Labour's other constituencies. Spin, disquiet over Iraq, disgust with Blair's proximity to Bush, panic about asylum seekers, hostility towards Europe and anxiety about public services could lead to support drifting away. Party membership has fallen; activists are demoralised; protest votes have grown; and erstwhile supporters are opting for everything from the Scottish Socialists to Ukip. More ominously, there is a growing number of non-voters. </p> <p>A commitment to the principle of equality is precisely what is needed to re-enthuse Labour's more questioning supporters. New Labour can already claim some achievements. Doggedly, if covertly, it has reduced child poverty, supported controls over the global environment and increased aid. Poorer families have also benefited from the reduction of unemployment, the increase in nursery places, and the minimum wage. But Labour has never been able to take much credit for this laudable record because it refuses to make a connection between the elimination of poverty and a more equal society. </p> <p>Most obviously, Labour is terrified of the E-word because it fears the reaction to higher taxation for the rich. This would be understandable if it were simply a tactical concern. But it seems more basic. For the evidence suggests New Labour agrees with the new right critique that greater equality could only be at the expense of a free-enterprise economy, and that its pursuit would consequently lead back to an ever more entrenched public sector. In short, a return to Old Labour. Therefore, giving up \"socialism\" means abandoning the goal of greater equality as well. </p> <p>This is a fallacy. It is based upon a foreshortening of history, in which the intellectual origins of neo-conservative laissez-faire are dated back to Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, of 1776. Omitted from the story is the fact that Smith's original reputation was that of a progressive whose work provided the foundation of the radical critique of aristocratic monopoly and of the bellicose state that protected it. </p> <p>It also forgets that the first thinkers and activists to build on Smith's work were libertarians of the left. They included people such as the English radical Tom Paine and the French revolutionary Condorcet, both of whom believed growing inequality was not the inevitable price of a free-enterprise economy, but could be remedied by science and \"the social art\". They were the first to propose universal pensions and schooling, death duties and tax-based systems of social insurance as remedies for poverty and ignorance. For them, two obstacles confronted social advance: \"force\" (aristocratic or oligarchic rule and the laws that protected it); and \"fraud\" (unreasoning superstition and prejudice born of ignorance). Unshackled from this legacy of injustice and oppression, capitalism went together in their minds with scientific progress, increasing equality, free trade, feminism, anti-slavery, anti-colonialism and anti-racism. </p> <p>This was not the founding moment of neo-conservatism. That came a few years later at the end of the 18th century with the frightened reaction to the French revolution. In England, loyalists burned Paine's effigy. In France, Condorcet died in prison. In this climate, anti-revolutionaries such as Edmund Burke and Thomas Malthus denied the radical implications of Smith's work, ridiculed Paine and Condorcet and set in motion the long-term association between liberal economics and conservative politics. </p> <p>But an accurate account of this period shows that the pursuit of equality can be conceived in terms quite other than those of socialism. The language of Paine and Condorcet was that of the coming together of commercial society and the modern democratic republic elaborated in the era of American and French revolutions. Greater equality with a minimal state, universal education, moderate redistributive taxation and social security belonged together in a language of reason and citizenship. As little reliance as possible was to be placed upon the state, since it was associated with a legacy of tyranny and corruption. </p> <p>Instead, the inequality and uncertainty constantly generated by a modern exchange economy was to be curtailed by a democratic constitution in which a framework of law was maintained by a combination of voluntary associations and local authorities - in modern terms, mutual associations, friendly societies, cooperatives, elected local boards, ethically oriented companies and trade unions. </p> <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, this new language of citizenship and democratic enlightenment was increasingly pushed aside by opposing extremes: on the one side, laissez-faire individualism and a language of markets; on the other side, socialism and the language of worker and capitalist. </p> <p>In the 21st century, Labour's \"big idea\" might be to start again from the true birthplace of social democracy, the Enlightenment of the 1790s, with its ambition to combine the benefits of individual freedom and commercial society with an ideal of inclusive citizenship and the public good. The needs of the market can be combined with policies fostering greater equality. New Labour needs to rediscover the first way. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gareth Stedman Jones is professor of political science at Cambridge University and director of the centre for history and economics, King's College.

  "There has never been a Labour party conference like the one that begins in Brighton this weekend. Never before in more than a century of its history has Labour gathered for a pre-election conference with a third full term so closely within its grasp. The last time that a British political party held such a conference was when the Conservatives went to Bournemouth in 1986. That was one of the most memorable conferences of the Thatcher years. It was marked by a series of domestic policy initiatives - collectively dubbed \"the next move forward\" - and coordinated by Norman Tebbit's aggressive party chairmanship. The effect was dramatic. A government still reeling from Westland (the Tories went to Bournemouth trailing Labour by six points in the polls) was revived and Mrs Thatcher was set on course for her third election win the following spring. <p>History never repeats itself precisely, but Labour needs to take a lesson from the Tories' 1986 playbook next week. The aim back then, Lord Tebbit recalls in his autobiography, was to show the voters \"a government confident, united, clear in where it was going - and determined to get there\". Those are not words that many people would have used about Tony Blair's government at several points in the past two years, but they exactly describe the goal for a government seeking to renew its mandate for the second time. If Labour can tell the voters a story about the future next week, about clear and substantive policy work already under way, about objectives that can be fulfilled within the next three to four years, and tell it in a manner which sharply differentiates the government from its rivals, then at least some of the voters who have moved away from Labour over the past two years may be won back and remotivated, just as the Tories were able to do with their voters in 1987. </p> <p>In recent weeks the message from many parts of the government has been that it intends to do just that. \"Policy rich\" speeches from ministers are said to be the order of the day, with important announcements trailed on parental rights, child care, overseas aid and freedom of information, among others. That all sounds promising, and although the policies will need to be carefully scrutinised, we believe that ministers should reach out as much as possible to their core voters in this way next week. Iraq has sapped the party of energy and conviction. The only realistic way in which these losses can be restored is by the strong conviction of Labour voters that this is, in spite of all, a government truly worth voting for. That will not be easy. Iraq was a terrible error. But a case can undoubtedly still be made. It has been boosted by the Tories, who have shown they intend to fight the next election on a reactionary cocktail of immigration, asylum and the inheritance tax. If that does not motivate Labour, nothing will. </p> <p>For its collective sake, the government needs to pull together next week. Though Labour remains ahead in the polls, there is little sign of real enthusiasm in large parts of the electorate. Labour will be put to the test in many ways at Brighton: by hunt protesters and by paternal rights campaigners, as well as by events in Iraq. But the party will also be tested internally. Any repetition of last year's discord among senior ministers could be costly. The challenge for the week is for the party's biggest players - Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Blunkett, Alan Milburn and the rest - to all act as a team. Inevitably, the biggest of these challenges is Mr Blair's. In his speech on Tuesday he must be truthful and humble, not evangelical and visionary, not just about the grim situation in Iraq but also about the domestic agenda. Many people think he no longer has that in him. Others think it is already too late. If ever there was a moment for Mr Blair to reclaim his own and his government's dignity it is now.</p>",
  "<b>Dear Peter</b> <br> As a lawyer you must be aware of the steady erosion of civil liberties we are witnessing in an increasingly authoritarian Britain. Now the Home Office is considering banning BNP members from the civil service. Surely encouraging public bodies to sack or veto people for their political views can only be yet another nail in the coffin of freedom. The fact that progressives can even contemplate such a move shows just how cavalier we have become about free speech and freedom of political belief. <p>You might say that a ban would only apply to members of an abhorrent party such as the BNP, but on principle we should be robust in arguing for the right of every citizen, every worker, to espouse the political views of his or her choice. Employment discrimination against members of any political party is McCarthyism by any other name dressed in the radical clothes of anti-racism. Giving the green light to any home secretary to ask would-be civil servants, \"Are you or have you ever been ... ?\" will affect all of us. </p> <p>And would you really trust David Blunkett, the most illiberal home secretary of the modern era, with even more power to police people's politics? Isn't that the same David Blunkett whose punitive treatment of asylum seekers and new immigrants can only make the cranks in the BNP full of envy? <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> There is a line to be drawn between the right to freedom of expression as balanced against the need for members of all communities not to experience racism and differential treatment in their everyday lives.</p> <p>The BNP, despite its recent attempts at adopting a cloak of democratic respectability, is an openly racist party that advocates policies that dictate people's rights depending on the colour of their skin. There is an expectation that with the exercise of power comes responsibility, particularly when one considers the exercise of public duties that often impinge on the rights of others.</p> <p>It is not unreasonable to propose that it is unacceptable for the promoters of certain political views to hold public office. I cannot, as a member of this society, expect my son to be taught by a racist or a sexist, or expect my freedom to demonstrate to be curtailed by such people purporting to be police officers or magistrates. </p> <p>I understand that the German constitution prevents Nazis from holding public office. The question should be whether the UK should have a lesser test. History provides some hard lessons of where democracy surrenders too many freedoms in the name of liberty. The BNP should be exposed for what they truly are, and the principle of balancing the rights of all citizens should not be dependent on the views of a rightwing and populist home secretary. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> Your talk of \"drawing and line\" and \"balancing ... rights\" actually means curtailing rights. Rights are not divisible; you cannot have the \"right to free speech unless your speech offends someone\". To qualify rights with conditions makes them gifts of the state, handed out and withdrawn arbitrarily. This is a matter of principle. However much you object to the BNP, that objection must not become the vehicle through which democratic gains are eroded for us all. </p> <p>You ask me to learn the lessons of history. You might remember the House Committee on Un-American Activities grew from a committee established in 1938 aimed at Nazi activity in the US. It became a permanent committee in 1945, and while little came from its investigations of Nazis it came into its own when it dealt with those who supposedly had communist sympathies.</p> <p>Public office-holders should be held to account for their capacity to do their jobs. If their political prejudices mean they actually abuse their power, then of course they should be disciplined. It would be as unacceptable for a housing officer with Christian views to deny housing to an atheist as for a BNP member to discriminate against an Asian. But neither should be denied a job simply because they hold particular views. </p> <p>The example of teaching is pertinent. I used to teach in further education. To many, my views were \"offensive\", especially my espousal of an open-door policy and an end to all immigration controls. As a trade union office-holder, I also led several strikes. None the less I was able to teach English and history as required and my students got good results. Those members of management who suggested my \"certain political views\" were incompatible with my teaching role were wrong, and it is a good thing they did not have the sanction to get rid of me. <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> I am afraid you fail to understand that the European court does not agree with your views as the right to freedom of speech is always balanced with my right not to be offended by what a racist or fascist might say.</p> <p>To suggest that BNP members can legitimately be police officers, judges or teachers appears to miss the point: BNP members' views are so fundamentally opposed to the democratic norms of society that they cannot perform the roles of police officers, judges or teachers without the strong suspicion that they will be inherently biased against the black and minority communities. On a rational basis, what confidence can we expect black and minority Britons to have in democratic institutions if they are supposed to expect equal treatment from card-carrying BNP civil servants?</p> <p>I recently had the pleasure of playing Paul Robeson at the Tricycle theatre in the play entitled Are You Now or Have You Ever Been a Communist? The ideological hysteria against communism is not to be confused with the attempt to restrict the BNP from holding public office. As Robeson said before the Congressional hearings: \"I am not being tried for whether I am a communist; I am being tried for fighting for the rights of my people, who are still second-class citizens in this United States of America.\"</p> <p>The ability of journalists such as Taki, writing in the Spectator, to express race hatred and anti-semitism has to be linked to the thug who then commits the racial murder on the street. Anyone who believes that holders of public office should be card-carrying members of the BNP should spend some time with a victim of race hate crime. Should we carry adverts inviting BNP members into the police force? I think not. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> I am sure you don't seriously expect me to take my lead in political principles from the unelected European court. Free speech is a political right that has to be defended by all of us, not a mere clause in some document dreamed up by bureacrats.</p> <p>I consider the fight for equality and against racism to be an important political focus but I think we are in danger of talking up the significance of the BNP in this context. The rise in votes for the BNP is accompanied by the rise in support for anyone who represents \"none of the above\", from a candidate dressed as a monkey to support for a ragtag of independent candidates. </p> <p>As many commentators have noted, many of those who vote BNP do so not because they are hardcore racists but rather as a way of giving two fingers to mainstream parties. This obsession with Nick Griffin and his nasty little coterie is actually helping transform them into the talking point of British politics. Ironically, it is policy proposals such as this employment ban that help build the BNP into a national political force.</p> <p>I am also worried by the ease with which you conflate speech with action. You move seamlessly from racist rants to racial murder. The distinction between the expression of certain views and the committing of specific acts is a crucial one, a bulwark against the insidious notion of thought crimes. </p> <p>Every section of society, of whatever ethnic origin, has far more to fear from a state that is able to criminalise views it considers unacceptable and treat them on a par with violent actions than any individual Pc Plod in the BNP. <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> You forget to recognise that the European convention is not some bureaucratic nicety interpreted by a few remote figures in Strasbourg. The convention, like the Geneva convention on refugees, has been endorsed by democratic governments and indeed was created from the desire not to have Europe descend into government-led dictatorships of the far right or left. On the one hand, you decry governments as being oppressive, but then denounce the articles of the European convention, which has the task of restraining governments and upholding the rights of individuals.</p> <p>Maybe my ability to link racist rhetoric and the physical attack derives from experiencing the aftermath of verbal abuse. The men, women and children who experience the aftermath of a BNP march and who are prevented from venturing out do not have the luxury of an academic debate with racist members of the BNP or their supporters. As a child growing up in the north-east, there was not a great deal of opportunity for someone who calls you a nigger to engage in the freedom of speech semantics in some cosy debate. </p> <p>Would you take your complaint of racial harassment, sexual assault or homophobia to a BNP police officer or magistrate? I doubt it </p> <p>The suggestion that by leaving the BNP to fester it will simply go away is, I believe, normally called appeasement. Pay a visit to the Holocaust museum in Washington, dwell for a moment in the slavery museum in Liverpool, or walk in the killing fields of Rwanda. Listen and look to the children of all races who are left to wonder what a world we have created. We owe a duty not to engulf them with the same complacency, indifference and laissez-faire attitude that is the hallmark of the oppression of one group by another.</p> <p>At the London Race Hate Forum we are aware of the clear link between the presence and activity of the BNP and the rise in racial violence and tension. An international prosecutors' conference in Stockholm two years ago found a well-organised and international fascist network, of which the BNP was clearly part. Ideas, funding, policies and strategies have been coordinated in Europe and North America for some time. The BNP are not the isolated thugs they may appear to be, and the sinister ability to move to the mainstream, as in Holland or in eastern Germany, should not be brushed aside.</p> <p>As a person likely to be on the receiving end of racism, I would rather see the BNP excluded from public office than wake up one day to say: \"I told you so.\" History rarely awards communities a second chance. At the end of the day you cannot enjoy your freedom at someone else's expense. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> I am not interested in defending the employment rights of BNP members per se any more than I am interested in the free speech of racists to racially abuse others. But once the principles of political freedom and free speech are compromised for those we despise, they are compromised for everyone. </p> <p>I agree about the importance of equal treatment under the law, and that is why I am not complacent about attempts to give legal endorsement to unequal treatment in the workplace. Have you noticed how convenient the BNP bogeyman has become for mainstream politicians who want to claim the moral high ground of anti-racism? </p> <p>No matter how reactionary Howard or Blair are on quotas, holding camps, or discussions about swamping, they never tire of issuing warnings against the extremists in the BNP. This is little more than a phoney moral crusade allowing those who really wield power and make discrimination a reality to dress themselves in the cloak of anti-racist virtue. Finally, do I trust government - local, national, or European - with even more power to finger people as a potential threat to democracy? Let's give the last word to Yusuf Islam (aka Cat Stevens). <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> The freedom to work is an important human right, but you place undue reliance on those holding public office declaring their personal and political bias. It would be naive to suppose individuals within the BNP would not wish to infiltrate public bodies.</p> <p>The issue of Yusuf Islam has little to do with employment rights and is an example of the clear difference between the Islamophobic approach of the US government and the legitimate protests made on his behalf by the Muslim community and the British government.</p> <p>Racial bias is by its very nature often an insidious threat, and in order to produce an inclusive society we need all citizens to have confidence in our democratic institutions. <br> <b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Claire Fox is director of the Institute of Ideas.
