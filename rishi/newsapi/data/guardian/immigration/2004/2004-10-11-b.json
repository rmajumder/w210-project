  "The Guardian has announced the shortlist of its Public Services Awards including the Public Servant of the Year Award. Backed by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and sponsored by Hays.

  "Danielle Beccan was returning from an evening out with a large group of friends at Nottingham's medieval Goose Fair when she was shot near her home. A gold Citro\u00ebn car with blacked-out windows pulled up alongside her and her friends noticed a gun. They told her to get down on the ground, but she was too slow. At least six bullets were fired and 14-year-old Danielle was hit once in the stomach. She collapsed on the ground. <p>Her mother, Pauline Platt, who has two other young children, heard the shots, ran round the corner and found her daughter collapsed with a single bullet wound to her stomach. She died on the operating table at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.</p> <p>Last night Nottinghamshire police said an arrest was made on Saturday. They refused to give any details, other than it was a Nottinghamshire person \"helping with their inquiries\", but officers said there might be revenge attacks.</p> <p>Superintendent David Colbeck said they had received intelligence that there might be trouble at the fair, and measures had been put in place, but the information was not specific and the measures did not include additional patrols in St Ann's, where Danielle lived and was shot.</p> <p>He added: \"We still have a long long way to go. There is still a core of individuals who believe the only way they can build their business is by using firearms.\"</p> <p>A 17-year-old local who did not want to be named said she saw the shooting. \"I was in [a nearby] street, and I heard the gunshots. I ran up here. I saw the car - a gold Citro\u00ebn with blacked-out windows.</p> <p>\"I reckoned it was case of mistaken identity, because they were with a group of boys. I reckon they were heading to get the boys but they shot the girl instead of the boys.\"</p> <p>She said she had tried to help Danielle: \"I caught her in the alleyway and tried to stop the wound from bleeding but she had internal bleeding.\"</p> <p>Another girl added: \"One of her friends saw a gun pointing out and shouted for everyone to get down but Danielle was too slow. She was dropping to the floor when she was hit in the chest and stomach. \"But she wasn't the target - they were going for one of the lads with her. She was an innocent victim.</p> <p>\"All she was doing was hanging out with her friends, which has nothing to do with this. But, as sure as night follows day, there will be reprisals.\"</p> <p>Two teenagers, Aleysha and Naomi Reid, said: \"She did not deserve to be shot. She was a black beauty; an angel. How can anyone kill an innocent 14-year-old girl? The people who did this should be locked away for ever.\"</p> <p>Yesterday red roses, lilies and gerberas lay piled on the pavement next to a blue and white teddy bear where Danielle Beccan was shot. A group of teenagers taped a tribute, in childish handwriting, to a lamp post. They paused for a moment, weeping and hugging each other.</p> <p>\"On the 9th of October every year we will sit down and celebrate the life of Danielle Becan,\" it reads. \"Who was a friend to many - but enemy to some. Thirty minutes past the hour of 12, bullets were shot and her life was stole. The heartache and pain is unbearable. How many times must a bullet fly before they're forever banned.\"</p> <p>Another card has a photocopied picture of Danielle with her hands on her hips and he message\": \"I love and miss you Dani RIP.\" Young people gathered in small groups weeping in disbelief as they examined the flowers.</p> <p>Sue Fish, Assistant Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire, called it a truly wicked and callous crime and added: \"We will do everything in our power to find the people responsible.\"</p> <p>It is the latest in a series of gun-related incidents which have plagued Nottingham, which experts fear has become infested with \"super thugs\" who command minions to do their bidding while taking millions of pounds from narcotics.</p> <p>Jamaican Yardies, many of whom repeatedly thwart deportation attempts, also have a strong foothold in the city's heroin and crack cocaine market.</p> <p>Danielle's grandfather Alvin Beccan, 69, said: \"She was just an easy going, nice girl. Her family are very cut up about it at the moment.\" Her uncle Devon visited the scene, placed a bunch of flowers and hugged two weeping women. As he drove past he said: \"We are absolutely devastated. If anyone prints that it was drugs and gang warfare they will have to face the consequences.\"</p> <p>John Bull, 61, who has lived in the area all his life, said there had been a rising tide of incidents involving drugs and guns. \"It beggars belief that a 14-year-old can be shot - it is unbelievable. There are no words to describe the animals who did this. They should be caught.\"</p> <p>Another teenager wept and said: \"I didn't get on with her, but this should never have happened. She didn't deserve it.\"</p> <p>Det Supt Colbeck said Danielle was not in a gang, but Goose Fair was traditionally a time of tension between rival groups. He said: \"I am just horrified and really angry. She's 14 - she's just a child. She's just going home with her friends from a good night out at Goose Fair.</p> <p>\"She's not part of a gang who's been shot and killed. She's innocent, for God's sake. It could have been your daughter, your son. It could have been you, just walking home. These people are evil and they need to go to prison.\"</p> <p>Nottinghamshire's chief constable, Steve Green, is a vociferous critic of liberal justice values who had described his force as being swamped by gun and drug crime. In July he opened a wider debate about the criminal justice system, saying that society's emphasis on tolerance and understanding was a \"failed\" social experiment. The evidence was on the streets, where youngsters behaved badly but knew how to play the system, he said.</p> <p>The Rev Evelyn Hall, of Mount Olive Apostolic church, said she had visited the family to offer words of consolation and prayer. \"There is so much shooting around here,\" she said. \"I think it is only God that can help with the forces of darkness and evil which surround the area.</p> <p>\"I do not think the police can do anything to help. I don't know how the family will cope. I am a mother of 10 and I wouldn't want to give one of my children away.\"</p> <p>The handwritten notice on the lamp post concluded: \"RIP Danzi Bi love ya lots babes. I wish you were still here. Luv DD.\"</p>",
  "The newly re-elected Australian prime minister, John Howard, could consolidate his hold on power with an outright majority in the senate, the first time for more than 20 years that the government has won control of both houses, it emerged yesterday. <p>The country's complex electoral system means that the final tally of senate seats will not be confirmed for several weeks, but there are indications that the ruling coalition will either win or fall one seat short of complete control.</p> <p>The latter scenario would give unprecedented influence to a newly formed party of the Christian right, Family First.</p> <p>Having comprehensively trounced his Labor rival, Mark Latham, in the elections on Saturday, Mr Howard's potential capture of the senate is likely to be the most important result of the election.</p> <p>A bloc of independent senators and minor parties traditionally prevent federal governments from controlling Canberra's second house, and since 1980 no prime minister has enjoyed a majority in both chambers. With complete control of parliament and an increased mandate from voters, Mr Howard will have the numbers to implement a more radical programme than he has ever attempted, a position that Family First, which has links to Australia's biggest Pentecostal church, is bound to want to take advantage of.</p> <p>There have been heart-on-sleeve Christians in Australian politics for many years, but the rise of a new strand of strident religious conservatism could change the face of political life in Canberra.</p> <p>The government made a pre-election offering to the Christian right in August when it amended the marriage act to insist that a marriage could only take place between a man and a woman.</p> <p>Mr Howard, who opened a 3,500-seat Pentecostal convention centre in 2002, has also promised to prepare \"family impact\" statements for all cabinet submissions as part of a pre-election voting deal with Family First.</p> <p>There is no indication yet as to what these statements will entail, but gay rights and working mothers have been longstanding targets of Australia's Christian family values campaigners.</p> <p>The Tasmanian Liberal MP Michael Ferguson cut his political teeth as director of the Tasmanian Family Institute, an organisation campaigning against the rights of same-sex couples to adopt.</p> <p>In Brisbane Family First has been embroiled in scandal after one party activist allegedly suggested that lesbians should be burnt as witches.</p> <p>Danny Nalliah, a Family First candidate on the party's Victorian senate ticket, has been accused of vilifying Muslims by the Islamic Council of Victoria, and put out a pre-election leaflet in which he urged followers to \"pull down Satan's strongholds\".</p> <p>\"Spot Satan's strongholds in the areas you are living (brothels, gambling places, bottleshops, mosque[sic], temples - Freemasons/Buddhist/Hindu etc, witchcraft,\" the leaflet read.</p> <p>The only prominent defeat suffered by the Christian right in Saturday's poll was that of the Liberal MP Ross Cameron, who fell foul of the family values code after revelations about his extra-marital affairs.</p> <p>Despite the emphasis on family values, the Christian right tends to be well to the left of the government on several of the more controversial issues which have convulsed Australian politics under Mr Howard. Family First's leader, Andrea Mason, is the only Aborigine to lead a major political party, and the party's immigration policy is to the left of both the government and opposition.</p>",
  "<p>It has taken Norman Sherry 30 years to complete his three-volume biography of Graham Greene. When you meet him, you can understand why. The time allotted for our interview - at the very club where he first met his subject back in 1974 - is the standard hour. After that hour, he hasn't quite reached the climax of the story about his first meeting with Greene. This is going to be a three-volume interview.</p> <p>But what a story. Greene, who had liked Sherry's two books retracing the footsteps of Joseph Conrad, had approached him through an intermediary and asked him to come to the Savile Club in Mayfair. Greene turned up on Saturday morning, as arranged, ordered a drink - a black and tan, Guinness and Bass, Sherry remembers it well - and then announced: \"Professor Sherry, I do not like academics.\" </p> <p>\"I thought, bloody hell,\" says Sherry, \"he comes all the way from the south of France to tell me this. Then he said: 'I don't like intellectuals. Do you want to know why? I'll tell you - their only interest is from the Adam's apple upwards; they've forgotten the pants.' </p> <p>\"I didn't know how to answer him. I just nodded my head. I felt this was pointless. Then he said: 'If you wanted to go to Saigon, you couldn't get in now. You couldn't do what you did for Conrad.' His face dropped and he suddenly asked, 'Are you a Catholic?' I said, 'Yes'. His face absolutely dropped - he did not want a Catholic to write his biography because that would be prejudiced, he thought. I said, 'I'm lapsed', and his face lit up again. </p> <p>\"He suddenly said, 'Let's go for a walk' - with his long legs, I had to trot beside him; I couldn't keep up. We got to Pall Mall and cut up St James's Street. At the club, he had said, 'It can't be, then. I don't want anyone crawling over my life.' So why on earth had he come? But now he was being friendly. He was going to show me where he used to drink with Kim Philby. </p> <p>\"It was raining a little, that soft, mizzly rain you get here. He ran across the road, horns were pressing, there were black cabs like beetles everywhere, and one of them knocked him down. He was lying in the road - I remember water running up his trouser leg - but he wasn't hurt. He got up, hitched his pants, walked swiftly towards me and said, 'You almost lost your subject.' I said, 'That's not half as bad, Mr Greene, as losing your biographer.' We laughed, shook hands. It was on.\" </p> <p>A fateful meeting for Sherry, one that changed his life completely. Then, he was a little-known literary critic - books on Jane Austen, the Bront\u00ebs, and his Conradian explorations. He was head of the English department at Lancaster University and married to the novelist Sylvia Sherry. Decent Eng-lit semi-obscurity beckoned. In agreeing to write Greene's life, he did not realise that Greene would, even from the grave, be rewriting his. </p> <p>Critics, who have hated Sherry's concluding volume, have made great play of the game Greene was playing with his diminutive, vain (he has a wonderful thatch of dyed orange-brown hair), loquacious literary sleuth of a biographer. David Sexton, in the London Evening Standard, called it \"a satirical trick on a gigantic scale, Greene's last, best joke\". Greene's son and niece, who have been at war with Sherry since Graham's death in 1991, have likened the biographer to Inspector Clouseau, doggedly retracing his peripatetic subject's footsteps but misinterpreting everything. </p> <p>Greene had sent Sherry a huge map of the world with every place he had been underlined, and said to him, \"You tell me when I went there.\" Sherry, who knew little about Greene when they met and had read only two of his books, originally estimated that the biography would take him three years. Greene told him it would take \"20 and then some\". </p> <p>So was it a game? Is Greene laughing at his biographer from his Catholic heaven - or hell? \"I think he got very serious about me,\" says Sherry. \"He really did like my Conrad books. He thought, 'This is the kind of guy I need who is going to travel and see the places I've been to and the things I've done.' He knew I was a literary detective. It was a combat in that way, but we became close friends. He never doubted that I was the right person to do it.\" </p> <p>But, yes, he admits, there was an element of game-playing. \"Once,\" he says, \"I went to Capri, where Greene had a home, bought with the proceeds of The Third Man. It was a tiny house, everything white, with a tiny cross and a table and a bloody awful bed which I got a splinter into my hand just by touching. That was his happy home. He didn't need a lot of things. There were no photographs there, nothing. </p> <p>\"As far as I knew, he was not on the island. I was tired, I had just gone to sleep, I wasn't wearing any clothes because it was hot. Suddenly I woke up and saw the bedroom door closing. I got up, ran to the door, opened it and saw a man going out of the front door. The moon was very strong and I saw he was a big fellow. Next morning I went to see Countess Cerio, a member of an important family on Capri. I said, 'Is Graham on the island?' She said, 'Absolutely not, and I would know.' </p> <p>\"When Graham died, I went to the funeral and afterwards I was walking away and someone came up behind me and said, 'Norman' in a deep voice. It was the countess. She said, 'Would you come to my car with me, there's something I want to tell you.' I went to the car, got in and she said, 'I lied to you that time when you came and asked whether it was Graham. It was Graham. What he said to me was this: 'I'm going to call on Norman; I don't see why he should just be my doppelganger; I'm going to be his doppelganger.' \" </p> <p>Greene often used aliases, had several long-term mistresses, travelled incessantly, inhabited many lives. He also had a real-life doppelganger who for many years sustained the fiction that he was Greene. Sherry, a twin born in Newcastle to a fiery Irish father and a prim English mother, began Greene's life as a respectful biographer - it was three years before they were on first-name terms - but has ended it as part of the multi-layered Greene story. </p> <p>The critics loathe the fact that Sherry refuses to keep a distance from his material. The first picture in volume three shows him sitting on a donkey in Mexico. \"It was a joke - I was only on the donkey for 14 seconds. I travelled in a Jeep the rest of the time.\" He includes some of his own poetry, becomes emotional when he recounts Greene's death - Sherry, 69, appears to have a pathological fear of dying. It is all very unconventional, very unbiographical. \"Magnificent but mad,\" as one more understanding critic put it.</p> <p>Sherry has devoted 30 years of his life to Greene and has got a monumental pasting for his pains. How is he coping with the verdict of Ian Thomson in the Observer? \"For Norman Sherry to have begun so promisingly and ended so badly is a personal tragedy.\"</p> <p>\"Some of the reviews here have been shocking, a disgrace,\" he says. \"Thomson's was so bloody silly, saying it's full of purple prose. When you've spent all this time on it and you're kicked in the arse, that's no pleasure. It's no pleasure for anyone being kicked in the arse.\" </p> <p>He says the reception in the US has been more favourable. \"The review in the Publishers Weekly in America said it was magnificent. It's damned funny that I seem to get good reviews in America but not here. Maybe journalists here enjoy kicking arse. Some of the comments are just cheap and vulgar, nasty and unnecessary.\" </p> <p>Sherry blames Greene's family for poisoning the atmosphere. \"They say the reason I quote sexual things about Graham is that I have a tremendous desire for sex. That's balls. Not a single quote in that book belongs to me. Let's see if they can find it or if I've misquoted Greene. I haven't misquoted Greene. I think some of the stuff they've been saying is utterly shocking.\" </p> <p>Greene's son, Francis, is literary executor of the estate, but Graham wrote a brief note to Sherry on his deathbed giving him carte blanche to quote from his letters and diaries. \"I will have to protect you from my family,\" Greene had told him. The protection arrived three days after Greene's death. </p> <p>\"Two weeks after he died,\" recalls Sherry, \"I got a letter from Francis. He said, 'In future you will send every chapter that you write to me and I will decide whether I find it publishable.' I said, 'I will send you every chapter, but I think you should see this document that I received from your father on his dying day.' So I sent him a copy of it. Nothing could happen then.\" </p> <p>Since the publication of the first volume in 1989, Sherry has had to fight a war on a second front. Yvonne Cloetta, with whom Greene spent most of his last 30 years, loathed the book, angry that it portrayed an earlier mistress, Catherine Walston, as the love of his life. She refused to offer any further assistance to Sherry - an absence which he admits made writing the final volume difficult. Cloetta died in 2002, but Sherry is still bitter about her reaction. \"She said: 'You've betrayed me, you've betrayed Graham and you've betrayed your craft.' That hurt me more than anything.\" </p> <p>The literary journey that began at the Savile Club ended in a French restaurant called Bistro Vatel in San Antonio, Texas, at table eight, where Sherry has dinner alone each evening. I wish I could relate, in Sherry's own words, how sitting there he corrected the concluding chapter of his typescript, but his account would run to about 10,000 words, taking in the architecture of San Antonio, why no one walks in the US, why he only pays half price at the restaurant, why he enjoys working in a noisy environment, the recent loss of his top set of teeth (his dentist and periodontist are both thanked in the acknowledgments), the genealogy of M Vatel (originally Watel), and the sad fate of a famous forebear, chef to Louis XVI, who committed suicide because he felt one of the meals he served up for the king was inadequate. A tour de force of digressive genius. </p> <p>Sherry lives in Texas because Greene sent him there - his letters to his wife, Vivien, were housed at Trinity University in San Antonio. Sherry went to consult them, got a professorship, is still there two decades later. He also left his first wife - he still adores her, but he wanted children and she didn't - and married the woman who was helping him transcribe Greene's impenetrable handwriting. They had two children - his 13-year-old son, born in the year Greene died, has the middle name Graham - but have now separated. </p> <p>The urgency to have children was also, in part, due to Greene. Sherry's journeyings in the master's footsteps made him vividly conscious of his own mortality: he contracted gangrene of the intestine in Panama, tropical diabetes in Liberia, and went temporarily blind after a car accident in the UK. He was mugged in Liberia and his assailant jabbed a revolver into his right ear, causing him permanent ear damage. So worried was Greene about his biographer's capacity for catastrophe that he connived to block Sherry's proposed visit to a Congolese leper colony. Even during this stay at the sedate Savile Club, he has managed to fall down the stairs. </p> <p>At the end of our conversation, showing old-fashioned courtesy, he wants to escort me to Bond Street tube station. I politely decline and cross the road cautiously.

  "Read the media and you'll be aware of a momentous political event taking place some way east of California. Over on the other coast something called the 2004 presidential election is happening. Swing voters are being courted, canvassers are knocking on doors, and suspicious-sounding 527 committees are piling money into local TV commercials. But out here on the west coast, where people are as passionate about their politics as anywhere else, the whole thing seems like a phoney war. Sure, there are petitioners on street corners and leafleters at farmers' markets, but where oh where are the real politicians? California needs to see more of middle-aged men kissing babies, it needs to see more secret servicemen wearing mirror shades, it needs more senseless ticketed photo ops dressed up as political rallies. <p>True, Bush and Kerry both visited Los Angeles in the summer, indeed in the same week, and they both put in an appearance in the spring, going to their rich friends' houses to ask for money. But compared to four years ago the attention paid to the nation's most populous state, the state with the largest economy in the union, the state that has given most money to the presidential candidates, has been pitiful. </p> <p>Four years ago, California was the centre of things presidential as the Democrats held their convention in Los Angeles. The candidates swung through the state, they even had their photo taken with the governor. But this time, no one is coming to the party. </p> <p>The main reason is that, without a convention to go to, national candidates figure that there is little to be gained from the long trek to the west coast. Californian voters, polling wisdom tells us, have made up their minds, and their minds are firmly Democrat. So the Kerry-Edwards team stays away, not wanting to waste money on the converted, while the Bush-Cheney camp prefers to focus on the swing states. After all, it's a long way from Florida to California. </p> <p>But California, according to the latest polls, is slightly more complicated than they imagine. For a start, the state mirrors the nation. The coast is liberal, the interior more conservative. The further you travel from the Pacific, the more Republican the voters become. Californians also tend to be classic third way voters, sticking to neither liberal nor conservative orthodoxies: they are liberal on social issues, such as gun control, abortion, the environment, but are fiscal conservatives, preferring deregulation, low taxes and small government.</p> <p>If you were to try to embody this confused political philosophy in one person, that figure might look something like Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. His recent flurry of decisions on bills passed by the state's legilsature have revealed him to be, well, unexpectedly liberal on some social issues - he is a Republican, after all - and convincingly conservative on others. So he has approved the distribution of clean hypodermic needles to people without prescription, toughened gun control and strengthened the rights of same-sex couples. But his conservative side has vetoed legislation promising an increase in the minimum wage, granting driving licences to undocumented immigrants and extending health insurance to cover maternity. Schwarzenegger has passed all of the tests set for him by the state's chamber of commerce, opposing all the legislation the chamber opposed and proving himself to be a reliable friend of car dealers, the pharmaceutical industry and big business in general.</p> <p>Of course, Governor Schwarzenegger is one explanation for the absence of the big players from California. His star wattage remains undimmed, despite the various political setbacks he has endured during the first 11 months of his mandate. No national politician in his right mind would be tempted by the prospect of sharing Arnold's spotlight in California. </p> <p>But Schwarzenegger is also one reason why it might make sense for the national players to come to California. His liberal credentials have earned him widespread support among Democrats and, if the state were ever to sway toward the Republicans, this might be the time. Recent polling suggests that the state may not be the shoo-in Democrats have for so long assumed. Three polls published in the last week send the sort of mixed message that can make George Bush so snippy. The Field Poll has Kerry leading Bush by 49-40, down from 53-41 in August, which in turn was down from a Kerry lead of 55-40 in May. But a survey by San Jose State University has Kerry ahead by just six points, at 48-42, down from his lead of 50-28 in July. And, just to confuse matters, the latest Rasmussen survey, covering the week to October 4, has Kerry ahead 53-40. </p> <p>Of course what will actually happen on November 2 is that John Kerry will win California, taking all its 55 electoral college votes with him and bearing out the decisions of the two campaigns not to bother with the state. Hopefully that result will lend weight to calls for reform of the winner-takes-all formula governing the presidential election. But don't hold your breath.</p>",
  "<p>The price of London Brent crude today passed through the $50 barrier for the first time as US oil futures also hit record highs.</p> <p>Brent crude reached $50.10 a barrel in morning trade on London's International Petroleum Exchange, the benchmark for Europe's imports of Middle Eastern, Russian and African crude. The figure was 39 cents up on the day, and almost $20 - or 65% - higher than at the start of the year. </p> <p>Meanwhile, US light, sweet crude oil futures hit a high of $53.48 a barrel, up 17 cents. Today's rises came as unions in Nigeria, which accounts for around 3% of the world's oil production, began a four-day general strike over fuel prices. The action follows a two-day oil unions strike at Shell last week, as well as threats from rebels to disrupt production.</p> <p>However, oil executives in the OPEC member country said there would not be an immediate impact on output.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, insisted the current price of oil was unjustified and should come down after next month's US presidential elections. \"There is no justification for it to be where it is,\" he said. \"This is a political year, and this may have some influence.\"</p> <p>Rapid growth in world oil demand this year, led by China, has eroded spare production capacity in OPEC nations, leaving the global market little scope to cope with disruptions. </p> <p>Mr al-Naimi added that Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, could pump an extra 1.5m barrels per day if required. However, oil traders said extra supplies of the kingdom's high-sulphur crude would do little to stem rising prices. </p> <p>Industrialised nations lack the hi-tech refinery capacity needed to process OPEC's low-quality crude into transportation and heating fuels, and this has forced refiners to increase bids for higher quality supply from Africa and the North Sea. </p> <p>In the US, supplies remain disrupted by Hurricane Ivan, which hit offshore oil producers almost four weeks ago. Around 475,000 barrels per day of Gulf of Mexico oil production remain out of commission and, although one third of that production is likely to be resumed by the end of the month, operators say some output may be out until next year. </p> <p>US supplies were again disrupted by the weather over the weekend, with tropical storm Matthew forcing the closure of the Louisiana offshore oil port. The port unloads around 900,000 barrels per day of imported oil, and 500,000 barrels per day of oil from the Gulf Mars platform. </p> <p>The US treasury secretary, John Snow, said at the weekend that rising oil prices were \"creating headwinds for the otherwise very strong economy\".</p>",
  "Tony Blair today promised to undo the British class system and make increased social mobility the mission of his third term as prime minister by expanding choice in the public services. <p>Speaking to the Institute of Public Policy Research in London, Mr Blair said that realising his vision of an \"opportunity society\" would require radical reform of the welfare state and a resolute continuation of the New Labour project.</p> <p>\"We have made real progress in Britain in the past seven and a half years,\" he said. \"But the truth about the country is that for almost 30 years, social mobility has stayed relatively constant.</p> <p>\"I want to see social mobility, as it did for the decades after the war, rising once again, a dominant feature of British life.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The third-term vision has to be to alter fundamentally the contract between citizen and state ... to move from a welfare state that relieves poverty and provide basic services to one which offers high-quality services and the opportunity for all to fulfil their potential.\"</p> <p>Outlining his plans to increase choice in childcare provision, pensions, public health and lifelong education and training, Mr Blair announced that a series of \"forward policy strategies\" would be published in the months running up to the general election.</p> <p>These, along with the five-year plans already published on health, education, transport, and law and order, will form the basis of Labour's election manifesto and the genesis of a series of reform acts in a possible third term.</p> <p>Mr Blair coupled the announcement of his plans for the future with an attack on those of the Conservatives and the reservations of his critics on the left of his own party.</p> <p>He accused the Tories of having \"looked at their polling and focus groups and decided to retreat to where they are most comfortable, beguiled by apparent support for hard-right positions on issues like immigration and Europe\".</p> <p>Dismissing Michael Howard's \"timetable for action\" a series of \"minimalist pledges\", Mr Blair said it was designed to conceal his \"laughably inconsistent\" policy platform.</p> <p>He said: \"The Tory alternative will not be presented primarily as a policy alternative. They dare not do that, because every time their major policies are exposed - particularly their ever-changing patients' and pupils' passports - they reveal themselves for what they are: policies to benefit a small minority of the better-off at the expense of the rest.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's speech comes after Mr Howard suffered another poll battering. The Tory leader's speech to his party's annual conference last week tried to capitalise on waning public faith in the prime minister. However, Mr Blair was voted most trusted party leader in a poll that placed Mr Howard third behind the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. </p> <p>Labour also leads the Tories by nine points on 39%, with the Lib Dems on 23% in the latest ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph. </p> <p>That would hand Mr Blair a historic third landslide victory with an estimated majority of 154 in the general election expected next May. </p> <p> Meanwhile, the Conservative chairman, Liam Fox, dismissed Mr Blair's speech as \"yet more talk\" and insisted that the Tories' proposals were more far-reaching than the government's.</p> <p>\"He cannot stop talking about building new societies and new economies. So far, we've had 'the decent society', 'the creative economy', 'a stakeholder economy', 'a new Age of Achievement' and 'the partnership economy'. </p> <p>\"Not to mention 'New Labour's Millennium Challenge', 'the information superhighway', 'a people's Europe' and, of course, 'the third way'. </p> <p>\"All this from the man who said 'this is no time for soundbites'.\" </p> <p>Dr Fox said that all Labour had achieved was \"a pension crisis; 66 tax rises; a million violent crimes; a million people waiting for NHS treatment and a million children playing truant\". </p> <p>He went on: \"No wonder people feel let down by Labour. Our proposals on healthcare, education, immigration, Europe and pensions are more far reaching than anything Labour are proposing.\"</p>",

  "Looking back, I had unrealistic expectations of the Labour party conference. I dared to hope that Tony Blair would apologise profusely for the last few years, his move to the right, the war and for David Blunkett in general. Perhaps he would revealing a little man behind a curtain who's been pulling the strings and has finally decided to let Labour be a socialist party after all. <p>Of course, this didn't happen. Blair's speech didn't contain the apology on Iraq so many people were looking for, despite politicians both here and in America backtracking wildly and denying having cited WMD and links with al-Qaida as reasons for the war. Instead, as usual, he suggested that people who express doubts about the war - and his methods in starting it - are defenders of Saddam Hussein. This is a cynical and easy suberversion of legitimate doubts about Blair's conduct, the declining state of Iraq, and the lack of sufficient reconstruction planning. </p> <p>Interestingly, Blair did acknowledge his fallibility, which is reassuring as he has recently been giving the impression that he thinks a knowing nod, reassuring us that he knows best, is sufficient. Sections of the Labour party have been worrying about whether Blair, his unpopularity and his stance on the war would overshadow Labour policies and affect their ability to win the next election. One thing's for sure, Blair's announcement of his intention to serve the full third term means that the PM's unpopularity won't overshadow Labour policies so much as speculation about his successor.</p> <p>Moving on to the Tory conference, at least I felt this was a party trying to attract my vote. Their choice of methods was, however, unfortunate. Perhaps I should be grateful to Alan Duncan for considering my emotional disposition and apparent inability to make my decision to vote based on \"theoretical macho policies\". After all, being female, I like to \"FEEL\". Unsurprisingly, I found this attitude offensive and repellent, but maybe that's because I'm reacting too emotionally, and not thinking objectively. </p> <p> Meanwhile the token scheme to attract young voters was the bizarre circulating of MPs' personal information - their first kiss, favourite novel and music tastes. I can't understand the logic behind these revelations. If young people don't care about politics, don't know who the MPs are, then the knowledge that their first kiss was aged 10, they enjoy reading Nick Hornby and they've heard of the Scissor Sisters, is entirely irrelevant. </p> <p>Young people don't look for politicians with their taste in music, they look people who provide policies they can agree with and believe in. The voting age is 18, not eight. It is offensive to believe you can dupe young people into voting for you by gimmicky and unconvincing ploys, detracting attention away from policies that leave them with massive debts after university and allow random drug testing in schools - a policy more likely than any other to increase the attitude of distrust and resentment that young people feel towards politicians. </p> <p> The Tories talk about trust as an issue that prevents people voting. They seem to believe that if they can gain trust, they will get more votes. I have to say, being able to trust the Tories is not a problem: they will introduce strict immigration controls, introduce ID cards, and discard the convention of the human rights. I find it perfectly believable that this would happen, and that's why I'm not voting Conservative.</p>",

  "For me, the Labour conference encapsulated both the contradictions and the confidence of New Labour. Despite being attacked from his own side on tuition fees, from the other side on foxhunting, and from both sides on Iraq, the prime minister came out of the perfectly stage-managed conference looking every bit the third-term PM he is sure to become. My main impression was just how smoothly everything seemed to go - internal dissent was left out of the timetable, and the delegates gave standing ovations to anyone in sight. It was difficult not to be impressed. <p>Gordon Brown's speech was bullish on the economy, resolute on Europe and bound by the usual gluttony of references to plain \"Labour\". Blair's speech was a bit more adventurous, setting out goals for a third term, basking in the glory of the first two, and showing at least a small degree of humility on Iraq (once he had buttered up the hall with talk of free childcare and an extension to the minimum wage!)</p> <p>On the other hand, some of what should have been big policy speeches (such as John Reid's) seemed superficial and rather devoid of actual substance. And on closer examination, Tony Blair's speech almost could have been that of an opposition leader: telling us how the current situation wasn't good enough and that if he were elected things would change. Tony, you have been in government, remember? He seemed oblivious as to how what he saw as room for improvement could be interpreted as a failure of his record in government.</p> <p>Blair's decision to announce that he would stand down at the end of a third term seems like a huge misjudgment. If there was one certain way to ensure that Labour party politics, and not Labour party policies, make the front pages, this was it. It is difficult to see how the manoeuvring for the leadership position won't start soon, and that is pretty much down to Blair's rather rash decision to announce it publicly, even if he had decided it privately. They will miss him though, as this party conference showed. His speech highlighted once again, that for all his faults, he still has a stature, confidence and oratory skills that are unrivalled not only in the Labour party, but probably anywhere in the House of Commons. Does this mean that I will vote for him? Well, I didn't say that, but for now, both the conference and Mr Blair get pretty good marks.</p> <p>So, where next for the Tories? The answer seems to be: \"Well, government, hopefully. Somehow. Err...\" Their conference was a real mix with something for everyone: a hard line on Europe and immigration for Ukip voters, potential (though not definite) tax cuts for the middle classes, more police powers for those in high-crime areas, and a promise for everyone on honesty and accountability. </p> <p>It was a case of the good, the bad and the downright ugly. The good was the \"timetable for action\". It caught my imagination as a positive way to play on the lack of trust in the government. The talk of accountability and sacking ministers who don't perform also went down well. Those who, like me, are appalled at the lack of action after the Butler report, should be impressed. So far, so good.</p> <p>However, no one in the Conservative party seems to understand that, as a single-issue party, Ukip should not be dictating Tory policy to the extent that they are. Yes, the Tories are Eurosceptic and expressing that is fine, but pursuing a harder line to win back Ukip voters is the wrong policy. It will surely alienate far too many other floating voters (such as myself) to be a worthwhile move. For me, the Tories need to show why they have so much more to offer voters than just Euroscepticism.</p> <p>The ugly was, almost inevitably, immigration. It seems typical of Michael Howard's leadership to produce a soundbite that reflects the worries of the British people. But the British people are worried about illegal immigration - no one wants to see persecuted Zimbabweans turned away and left to fend for themselves just because a quota has been filled. It was a horrible, badly thought-out idea, and made an otherwise solid conference - and solid speech from Howard - seem regressive and desperate.</p> <p>Now the conferences are over, I must admit that I have been passionately engaged in politics over the last few weeks. But it has all been on the other side of the Atlantic. Over 60 million Americans watched the first presidential debate. How many Britons watched the party conferences, I wonder? How many even knew they were happening? The fact is that British party conferences are boring: aimed for the most part at delegates not voters, they are staid, lifeless affairs. In contrast the presidential debates in the US have been fascinating: they focus directly at the electorate and have a confrontational edge to them that lends drama to some otherwise quite tedious and technical issues. They allow scrutiny of a leader's performance under pressure, and the live television aspect removes much of the third-party slant often evident in media reporting. If British politics is serious about ending voter apathy and re-energising the electorate, particularly those of my generation, I really think this would be worth considering. </p> <p> </p>",
  "Vote Tony, get Gordon?! In spite of Blair's giant \"five more years\" inflatable pig floated out over Brighton, I don't feel it makes much difference which of the two occupies No 10. Amazing - all the trouble and expense of staging a party conference, but the big media stunt totally sidelined the whole thing, including the bits when some of the party actually voted against the leadership. Renationalise the railways? Stop the government dismembering council housing? Blown away. <p>In this great democracy of freedom-loving people, the aberration of voting cannot be allowed to distract from the war against bearded flip-flop wearers. What I didn't realise was how many of the radicals have now left the party. Unfortunately, the remaining moles, the ones who still have loads of \"troops out!\" posters left over from the 1980's - put up an anti-Blair motion that no one who understands the current situation in Iraq could seriously vote for. </p> <p>Of Blair's 10 policy points, only one sets the world a tiny bit on fire. Child care delivered via schools should help a lot of parents to manage their increasingly complicated lives, as long as the schools get the additional support to fulfil their new role as community centre-cum-cr\u00e8che. </p> <p>More money for drug dependency treatment is great: all the experience on the ground shows that this approach keeps users within society and offers the chance of remission. It makes a change from that litany of lock 'em up initiatives from Blunkett. </p> <p>However, Blair on housing is no different from Thatcher - transfer of council houses into private sector ownership is being pushed forward in the face of widespread tenant opposition. The idea that the private sector will queue up to build \"affordable homes\" in places where they're needed or in places where people actually want to live is dangerously flawed. And what are the housing options for the millions who don't qualify for a mortgage at all, let alone one for \u00a360,000? </p> <p>Brown's speech was perceived as an affirmation of \"core Labour values\", and it even had a visionary bit on the reduction of developing world debt (cue G7 summit: puff of smoke, initiative disappears!) but Gordon and Tony were united on a \"leave the higher earners alone\" fiscal policy while John Major was still in Downing Street. </p> <p>The NHS and schools are the last remaining sacred cows. New Labour doesn't \"do\" public sector infrastructure any more, and will not willingly spend public money on pensions, transport, energy, housing, water treatment and flood defences. That would mean raising taxes above current levels! Aieee! It burns us! Let's be real. Where it matters, there is no important difference between Blair and Brown.</p> <p>Onwards to the Slumberdown reps' convention in Bournemouth, with a confidence-building message from Michael Howard about firing members of his team who don't deliver. Does this mean he'll be sacking himself after the election? </p> <p>Enjoyed the irony-free lament about the decline of public trust in politicians, but surely floating voters remember he was part of the administration that saw two of its prominent members locked up for perjury and fraud? Oliver Letwin wants to cut taxes but knows the options are limited if he wants to avoid committing electoral suicide. Even the delegates in the hall know this. So the Tories' battle cry now is: \"We are the party who'd quite like to cut taxes!\" </p> <p>But leave it to David Davis to bring out the banner with the true colours on it. \"Future immigration! Six cities the size of Birmingham full of foreigners in the next thirty years!\" he snarls. Nice. That delegate sleeping in the front row suddenly woke up and tasted the air with a long forked tongue.</p>",
  "The highlight of the Labour party conference was, naturally, the leader's speech, while the highlight of the speech was the interruption by the \"blood-on-your-hands\" protester. Blair's response - that he was lucky to live in a country where protest was allowed - ignored the fact that security at the conference was so tight that only a few intrepid democrats managed to gain access to the hall. That there were more foxhunters than anti-war protesters was unfortunate. Where was Robin Cook? <p>So, any hope of a grassroots-inspired revolution had been managed out of the conference and we were left with Brown's oldish-Labour speech and Blair's performance. Brown, I thought, came over well but I felt Blair was speaking from a position of weakness. His 10 points were extremely boring and I only stuck with him because I was expecting something on Iraq and I felt that I ought to listen because I had a Guardian piece to write. There was something about broadband in there and a joke about Prescott's pledge cards but that's about all I recall. Blair's non-apology on Iraq was unsurprising and he may be hoping that the issue will die down during the election campaign and beyond. I don't think it will. </p> <p>His speech cannot now be considered without reference to subsequent events: his operation, his house purchase and his resignation. He may have given five years' notice but he has resigned nevertheless. My impression of all this is that he has provided himself with a number of exit strategies, should circumstances prove overwhelming. Granted, his medical condition is (probably) not manufactured but it's an ideal \"out\" should he need it. Of course, following these revelations, most comment reverted to the Blair/Brown confrontation and questions of the succession. It is assumed that Labour will win the election with a discredited leader and this is unfortunate. As an aside, Blair suggested in an interview that the British people were the ones who decided whether he kept his job or not. That is not the case. It is up to the Labour party to elect a leader and I maintain my position that I will not vote Labour as long as Blair is leader. At the beginning of his speech, he praised the British electorate for voting for change in 1997. The chances are I'll vote for change in 2005.</p> <p>Turning to Tuesday's BBC coverage of Michael Howard's speech to the Tory conference, what do I find? Apart from the amateurish Andrew Neil, here's the beast himself (Alastair Campbell), brought in to comment on Howard's effort. Clearly, the Labour party doesn't understand that Campbell is a guaranteed vote-loser. His face on the screen brings it all back: spin, briefings, complaints to the media, Iraq, WMD, 45 minutes, Kelly, Hutton, petulant Channel 4 interview, harmful BBC resignations, grandiose resignation speech - every one a vote-loser. If Labour must have him involved in the general election campaign, then they ought to keep him in a back room, well away from TV cameras.</p> <p>Howard's speech was, I thought, well delivered and the themes mostly predictable: crime, immigration, Europe and hospital bugs. The Tories are attempting to stem the flow of votes to the UK Independence party, but I'm not sure that filling more prisons is a particularly enlightened approach to crime and I remain unclear as to the Conservative policy on Europe. Do they advocate a two-tier system or renegotiation of the treaties? The peroration came across as genuine and heartfelt and perhaps revealed a facet of Michael Howard's personality which the pointless bickering of PMQs in the Commons fails to show. Despite this, the only way I would feel obliged to vote Tory would be if my wife were the candidate and, as that is not the case, the Conservatives join Labour on the \"reject\" heap for the general election.</p> <p>I'm still inclined towards the Lib Dems but the Scottish Nationalists (SNP) were second in my constituency last time round and the sitting MP, Brian Wilson, is not standing again. I wonder if he regrets not standing for the Scottish parliament - he'd probably be first minister by now. The question is: do I vote on principle (Lib Dem) which, without proportional representation, would be ineffective or do I vote tactically (SNP) in order to threaten Blair's third term? My vote remains afloat.</p>",
  "<p>An unexplained and unprecedented rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere two years running has raised fears that the world may be on the brink of runaway global warming. </p> <p>Scientists are baffled why the quantity of the main greenhouse gas has leapt in a two-year period and are concerned that the Earth's natural systems are no longer able to absorb as much as in the past. </p> <p>The findings will be discussed tomorrow by the government's chief scientist, Dr David King, at the annual Greenpeace business lecture. </p> <p>Measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere have been continuous for almost 50 years at Mauna Loa Observatory, 12,000ft up a mountain in Hawaii, regarded as far enough away from any carbon dioxide source to be a reliable measuring point. </p> <p>In recent decades CO2 increased on average by 1.5 parts per million (ppm) a year because of the amount of oil, coal and gas burnt, but has now jumped to more than 2 ppm in 2002 and 2003. </p> <p>Above or below average rises in CO2 levels in the atmosphere have been explained in the past by natural events. </p> <p>When the Pacific warms up during El Ni\u00f1o - a disruptive weather pattern caused by weakening trade winds - the amount of carbon dioxide rises dramatically because warm oceans emit CO2 rather than absorb it. </p> <p>But scientists are puzzled because over the past two years, when the increases have been 2.08 ppm and 2.54 ppm respectively, there has been no El Ni\u00f1o. </p> <p>Charles Keeling, the man who began the observations in 1958 as a young climate scientist, is now 74 and still working in the field. </p> <p>He said yesterday: \"The rise in the annual rate to above two parts per million for two consecutive years is a real phenomenon. </p> <p>\"It is possible that this is merely a reflection of natural events like previous peaks in the rate, but it is also possible that it is the beginning of a natural process unprecedented in the record.\" </p> <p>Analysts stress that it is too early to draw any long-term conclusions. </p> <p>But the fear held by some scientists is that the greater than normal rises in C02 emissions mean that instead of decades to bring global warming under control we may have only a few years. At worst, the figures could be the first sign of the breakdown in the Earth's natural systems for absorbing the gas. </p> <p>That would herald the so-called \"runaway greenhouse effect\", where the planet's soaring temperature becomes impossible to contain. As the icecaps melt, less sunlight is refected back into space from ice and snow, and bare rocks begin to absorb more heat. This is already happening. </p> <p>One of the predictions made by climate scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that as the Earth warms, the absorption of carbon dioxide by vegetation - known as \"carbon sink\" - is reduced. </p> <p>Dr Keeling said since there was no sign of a dramatic increase in the amount of fossil fuels being burnt in 2002 and 2003, the rise \"could be a weakening of the Earth's carbon sinks, associated with the world warming, as part of a climate change feedback mechanism. It is a cause for concern'.' </p> <p>Tom Burke, visiting professor at Imperial College London, and a former special adviser to the former Tory environment minister John Gummer, warned: \"We're watching the clock and the clock is beginning to tick faster, like it seems to before a bomb goes off.\" </p> <p>Peter Cox, head of the Carbon Cycle Group at the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Change, said the increase in carbon dioxide was not uniform across the globe. </p> <p>Measurements of CO2 levels in Australia and at the south pole were slightly lower, he said, so it looked as though something unusual had occurred in the northern hemisphere. </p> <p>\"My guess is that there were extra forest fires in the northern hemisphere, and particularly a very hot summer in Europe,\" Dr Cox said. \"This led to a die-back in vegetation and an increase in release of carbon from the soil, rather than more growing plants taking carbon out of the atmosphere, which is usually the case in summer.\" </p> <p>Scientists are have dubbed the two-year CO2 rise the Mauna Loa anomaly. Dr Cox said one of its most interesting aspects was that the CO2 rises did not take place in El Ni\u00f1o years. Previously the only figures that climbed higher than 2 ppm were El Ni\u00f1o years - 1973, 1988, 1994 and 1998. </p> <p>The heatwave of last year that is now believed to have claimed at least 30,000 lives across the world was so out of the ordinary that many scientists believe it could only have been caused by global warming. </p> <p>But Dr Cox, like other scientists, is concerned that too much might be read into two years' figures. \"Five or six years on the trot would be very difficult to explain,\" he said. </p> <p>Dr Piers Forster, senior research fellow of the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, said: \"If this is a rate change, of course it will be very significant. It will be of enormous concern, because it will imply that all our global warming predictions for the next hundred years or so will have to be redone.\" </p> <p>David J Hofmann of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration centre, which also studies CO2, was more cautious. </p> <p>\"I don't think an increase of 2 ppm for two years in a row is highly significant - there are climatic perturbations that can make this occur,\" he said. \"But the absence of a known climatic event does make these years unusual. </p> <p>\"Based on those two years alone I would say it was too soon to say that a new trend has been established, but it warrants close scrutiny.\"</p>",
  "At the Sunrise and Hope children's centre, next to the refugee camp in Khan Yunis, I found myself a game. Dozens of small boys gathered for an impromptu replay of England v France. Amid the ubiquitous graffiti celebrating the heroes of the intifada, we spoke the globalised language of football. \"Zidane, Zidane, he is Arab,\" they chuckled. <p>Afterwards, they showed me their burns and bullet wounds, proud of the scars that marked them out as mini-martyrs in the fight against oppression. </p> <p>But the bravado of the football field was just that. A nurse from the mother-and-baby clinic in the rabbit-warren Darraj district of Gaza City, where more than 10,000 families are registered, spoke of how all the children suffer bed-wetting and nightmares. Many are too afraid to sleep alone. </p> <p>The Gaza community mental health programme has catalogued a full range of post-traumatic stress symptoms displayed by the children: stammering, depression, headaches, stomach pains, the inability to concentrate. Behind the cheeky grins, the shooting and shelling is educating the children of Gaza on a daily syllabus of fear. </p> <p>Pent-up frustration leads to hyperactivity in school. The centre holds daily anger-management classes. For an hour before school the children throw balls against a wall. In the last few years, academic results have plummeted. </p> <p>It is little wonder. Wella was shot by a sniper during lessons. Unlike the boys, she was close to tears as she showed us a six-inch wound in the centre of her stomach. \"Every time I have a bath I remember when I was injured. I am angry with the soldiers. Why did they do this? I didn't do anything. I was in school.\" </p> <p>Hamas won't need to teach these kids how to graduate from throwing balls to throwing stones and bombs; they are learning all they need to learn about violence from the Israeli Defence Force. </p> <p>All the children have their stories. Leaa Hussein Najim is 10. \"At 7.30 in the morning the Israeli bulldozers started destroying our house fence. The walls started falling. Big rocks fell down on my leg and it was injured. I was not able to stand on it. My mother carried me while my father carried my grandmother, but he fell down because he was in a hurry. Afterwards I went back. I didn't know where our house was. Everything was under destruction, my books and uniforms.\" </p> <p>Aya Al-Shaer is 13. \"We felt very afraid. My father said to the bulldozer: 'Please give me time to take our furniture out of the house.' But the bulldozer didn't agree, and started shooting at my father. He was shot in the back and the leg.\" </p> <p>The stories go on. Rouan said she \"sleeps with tears every night\". Another boy from the Brazil area of Rafah returned to search out his clothes and books among the rubble. Finding nothing, he went to school in his pyjamas. </p> <p>A few hundred yards from six-storey concrete flats, along the ironically named Philadelphi road, a huge Israeli barrier spreads its concrete wings along the length of Rafah. We picked our way through the chewed-up wreckage created by tanks and bulldozers. </p> <p>And then, out of nowhere, without us having crossed any sort of line and with no warning, a machine gun from the nearest watch-tower opened fire. As we dropped to the ground and scattered, a woman in a nearby tenement continued to hang out her washing. She had seen it all before. </p> <p>Despite all this, children continue to play. The Gaza strip is one of the most densely populated places on the planet and the majority of the population is under 16. The local zoo may have been destroyed, the football field is far too dangerous, and the beach has been appropriated by settlers and soldiers. Some play football in the cemetery. In Gaza, death is never very far away.</p>",
  "<p>An unexpected sight greets the holidaymaker out for a gentle cruise on the 186-mile Lake Powell in Arizona. A mile or so upriver from the Glen Canyon dam stand red and green channel markers to guide those on the water. But the signs planted in the riverbank are of little use today: thanks to a drought which is entering its sixth year, the lake's water level has dropped by 40 metres (130ft), leaving the signs on each bank stranded at the top of a cliff. </p> <p>Steve Ward, who works for a tourism company, steers his motorboat into a bay and points to an island across the sparkling blue water. \"Normally we'd go across there to leave the bay,\" he says, \"Right now we can't, because there's land in the way.\" </p> <p>That land, like the many newly emerged beaches dotted around the lake, would normally be under 30 metres of water. </p> <p>Lake Powell, the second largest reservoir in the US, which fills the canyons straddling the border between Utah and Arizona, is an important link in the chain of water supply drawn from the Colorado river. So the falling water levels are not just a story of a tourist attraction facing tough times, but an environmental problem that may have a fundamental impact on life in seven of the states of the western US, notably the thirsty states of California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. </p> <p>That supply keeps agriculture in the south-west of the US irrigated, provides for the needs of industry, keeps lawns sprinkled and green, and enables people to wash their cars and themselves. Without the water from the Colorado river most of the west would revert to its natural state: a desert. </p> <p>This year the drought has hit home, causing alarm among the community of scientists, technicians and bureaucrats whose job it is to slake the thirst of the west. </p> <p>\"If the drought continues it will force the states to sit down and take some truly tough decisions,\" says Ken Rice, the manager of the dam, who works for the government's bureau of reclamation. \"It really depends on what mother nature does over the next few years.\" </p> <p>The threat of the drought is made tangible by the declining lake levels. Further down the Colorado river near Las Vegas, at Lake Mead - the biggest reservoir in the US, created by the Hoover dam - the remains of a once submerged village are starting to emerge. </p> <p>At Lake Powell, the \"bathtub ring\", a white mark left on the orange sandstone of the canyon by the receding lake, provides a jarring reminder of where the water should be, and a handy indicator that the lake is just 38% full, with a level of 1,088 metres. </p> <p>When the lake drops to 1,064 metres, it will have reached the minimum level at which the two power stations that use its water can operate safely, and the lake will effectively be decomissioned. </p> <p>Pictures of the Lake Powell Lodge at Wahweap - literally \"bitter water\", the lake's largest resort - show it perched on the shore, water lapping at its foundations. Today it is a third of a mile from the water's edge. </p> <p>The concrete launch ramp built to enable the thousands of holidaymakers who come to Wahweap each year to put their houseboats, dinghies, speedboats and jetskis on to the lake stops about 10 metres short of the water. It has been extended twice in the past year, and in August a system of welded steel tubes was laid into the water to provide additional access. The total cost of bringing the tourists back to the water's edge at Wahweap has been $5m (\u00a32.8m). </p> <p>But with the level of the lake falling by 53cm (20in) a week, unless there is significant rainfall between now and the spring, and unless the snowmelt that contributes most of the water increases on recent years, the ramp will have to be extended again for next year. </p> <p>\"We've been releasing more water than has been coming in, due to our legal obligations,\" says Mr Rice, turning to look out of his office window on top of the dam. </p> <p>The legal obligations explain why the drought could have a profound impact on the way water is used as far away as California. </p> <p>The Colorado river is the subject of a complex series of contracts and compacts dating back to 1922. Known as the law of the river, they establish a hierarchy of demand on the Colorado's water, with California having the greatest say. </p> <p>Should the water start to dry up and real cuts in supply be made, other states will lose their supply before California, which receives some 14% of its water from the river. Water trading and legal fees are the most likely outcome of any attempt to implement the law of the river. </p> <p>\"Our role is to make the states understand that if they don't get their act together, we will step in,\" says Bennett Raley, assistant secretary for water and science at the US interior department, which oversees the bureau of reclamation. </p> <p>Mr Raley, who has been going to water meetings since he was 11, says the drought should make people change the way they think about and use water, and that farming in the west should look both at its practices and at its choice of crops. </p> <p>\"People say that the west has obviously grown out of its water supply and must stop growing,\" he says. \"That's reasonable on the face of it, but not true. The issue in time of drought is what will be the relationship between irrigated agriculture and the cities. The secretary of the interior does not have the legal authority to say, 'Needs have changed, we're going to reallocate water from agriculture to urban use.' The view of this administration is that the market is the best way to make those changes.\" </p> <p>But some argue that the reservoir should simply be allowed to drain away. \"Glen Canyon dam and Lake Powell are unnecessary and counterproductive for the water needs of the west,\" says Chris Peterson of the Glen Canyon Institute. </p> <p>\"They've destroyed one of the most beautiful places in the world. We're in a water management crisis. We're dealing with a system that is 50 years old. It's like a 57 Chevy. </p> <p>\"Since that time, America has started to appreciate its wildlife, and we've also realised that there are better ways of storing water. We live in a desert. There's plenty of water - the question is who gets it and how is it stored.\" </p> <p>He predicts that if the drought continues (and some say that it is not a drought, but a return to normal conditions after a 50-year wet period), any attempt to enact the law of the river will become mired in litigation. </p> <p>Mr Ward starts to climb the steep slope from the water's edge to the latest temporary car park. \"I choose to be optimistic and tell people there's things we haven't seen for 30 years, come and see them before they're covered up,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I don't consider this drought to be a danger to Lake Powell as much as it is to the west of America. If this is a 30-year drought, things are going to have to change all over America.\"</p>",
  "Egyptian security forces investigating the resort bombings that killed at least 33 people were concentrating their hunt yesterday on a group of previously unknown Egyptian militants. <p>An Egyptian security official involved in the search conceded that \"the perpetrators are Egyptians\", but added that they had \"help from someone outside\". </p> <p>The Israeli government has blamed al-Qaida for the explosions last Thursday, rather than a Palestinian group. </p> <p>Osama el-Baz, an adviser to the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said he did not necessarily disagree but had no concrete evidence. </p> <p>He said: \"We are open-minded. The initial report was al-Qaida but we have not found any evidence yet to substantiate this premise. We are still looking for clues.\" </p> <p>Mr Baz said the British government had offered explosives experts and this help would be taken up if needed. </p> <p>More than 20 people have been arrested in Egypt in connection with the bombings at the Red Sea resort of Taba, near the Israeli-Egyptian border, and further south at Ras Shitan. Both are popular with Israeli holidaymakers. </p> <p>The Egyptian government said yesterday that only 15 bodies had been positively identified so far, six of them Israeli and nine Egyptian. </p> <p>Later DNA tests confirmed that two Italian sisters were among the victims, Italy's foreign ministry revealed. The bodies of Jessica Rinaudo, 19, and 22-year-old Sabrina will be returned to Italy by military plane. </p> <p>The Egyptian security official said indications that the group was Egyptian stemmed from the discovery that a saloon car used in the Taba attack had been bought in Egypt. The car, filled with explosives, rammed into the hotel, causing the collapse of one side of the 10-storey building. </p> <p>Having bought the car inside Egypt the group would have been able to cross the many checkpoints inside the Sinai desert without much trouble. </p> <p>The Egyptian security services are operating on the theory that the explosives were brought into the country separately. </p> <p>\"The explosives were probably brought to Sinai from Aqaba from Jordan or Saudi Arabia,\" the official said. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of the al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, and various al-Qaida cells or groups sympathetic to al-Qaida continue to operate there underground. It would have been relatively easy to smuggle explosives across the Red Sea. </p> <p>Jordan is also home to al-Qaida members and sympathisers, although to a lesser extent than Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>It is the birthplace of Abu Musab al- Zarqawi, the leader of Tawhid and Jihad, the al-Qaida-style group creating mayhem in Iraq. </p> <p>Among those arrested by Egypt are bedouin tribesmen being questioned about the explosives. The bedouin are being blamed by Egypt for human trafficking and drug smuggling by boat from rocky islands in the Gulf of Aqaba into Sinai. </p> <p>The Egyptian security services have ruled out remnants of the two main Islamist terrorist groups inside the country, Islami Jihad and al-Gamaa al-Islamiya. The former has disbanded and the latter agreed a ceasefire seven years ago after an Egyptian government crackdown. </p> <p>The security official said police and intelligence officers kept watch on former members, and any attacks would have to be carried out by new members with no police records. The official added that they would have needed help from outside. </p> <p>The Egyptian and Israeli governments are cooperating in the investigation. </p> <p>The Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Abu Gheit, said the Israeli ambassador to Egypt had initially protested that the country was not doing enough in the immediate aftermath of the bombings, a charge Mr Gheit forcefully rejected. </p> <p>The envoy insisted that the attacks would not upset talks with the Israeli government on its planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>The situation has been helped by the fact that Palestinian groups do not appear to have been involved. </p> <p>Mr Mubarak's adviser, Mr Baz, said that even though it seemed unlikely that the explosives had gone in across the Israeli border Egypt would propose tightening the border controls with Israel. </p> <p>The Camp David agreement in 1979 ending conflict between the two countries allows only a police presence, but Mr Baz said it would be better to have military or border police in place.</p>",
  "More than 1,000 of the 2,500 immigration and asylum advisers in Britain may be \"struck off\" by next April because of problems surrounding a new state accreditation scheme, the Law Centres Federation has warned. <p>The scheme, designed to put cowboy advisers out of business, is in danger of driving away many experienced experts as well. </p> <p>Publicly funded immigration solicitors and advisers must pass a two-day exam, being held in London, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester and Newcastle on three dates in September, November and next February. </p> <p>The federation says it is concerned that many will fail to qualify under the scheme run by the Legal Services Commission and the Law Society before the deadline in April. </p> <p>It argues that the timescale is unrealistic because the exam is being offered only intermittently at select locations that lack the necessary facilities. </p> <p>Only a few hundred appeared to have passed so far, its director, Steve Hynes, said. It was necessary to weed out the cowboys, but the effect, combined with the time restriction on legal aid work, was to severely restrict what private practice solicitors could do, he added. </p> <p>Sarah Hall, an immigration solicitor who recently left Bury law centre to practise criminal law, said the scheme was the \"final nail in the coffin\". </p> <p>\"From last April when the changes came in, I have spent more time applying for funding and appealing against refusals of funding than I have actually doing legal work on the cases,\" she said. </p> <p>Crispin Passmore, the head of immigration services at the Legal Services Commission, said the scheme was a fundamental part of the drive to guarantee good quality publicly funded asylum and immigration advice. He said there was sufficient capacity to assess up to 4,000 applicants. </p> <p>\"It is for the advisers themselves to decide when they sit the assessment. We also refute the claim that accreditation is biased towards private practice solicitors.

  "Come that May morning next year there is one issue that will get me to the voting booths and, despite the anger about Iraq, will ensure that I vote Labour: that is the party's pledge to halve child poverty by 2010. Labour has done the easiest bit: it hit the 2004 target and got a million children out of poverty with a working tax credit, child tax credit and increases in the minimum wage. The 2010 target is the one that will really shake up Labour policy big time: this is where it starts to get fun. <p>Labour is not going to spell it out ahead of the next election, but if there is any hope in hell of reaching that 2010 target it will require some serious rethinking of New Labour's approach to benefits and tax increases. If Labour wins the election and sticks to its target, the next term could shape up to be the most radically redistributive government my generation has ever seen - but don't expect any cabinet minister to breathe a word of that to middle England. </p> <p>Ironically, amid all the fondness for radical third-term thinking in the past few weeks, this one really radical policy of New Labour already announced has had little airing. That makes a paper published today by the campaigning thinktank Catalyst, Why Inequality Matters, particularly timely. It points out that while New Labour may have stalled the increase in inequality, it has done nothing to reverse it. The international comparisons are as embarrassing as ever: in purchasing power, the poverty of the poor British child is 11% worse than that of their American counterpart and nearly 30% worse than in France. It's a shocking thing to say, but if you're going to be poor you'd be better off in America. </p> <p>Catalyst's paper unashamedly revives old debates. First, that equal opportunity cannot be used (as New Labour has been wont to do) as a substitute for equality. The two are interlinked: the most egalitarian countries, such as Scandinavia, have the highest rates of social mobility, whereas in the UK this has seized up in recent decades, and opportunity is now effectively determined by the status and wealth of the parents. The idea that the poor, clever kid can succeed looks good, Billy Elliot-style, on the big screen, but it's a myth for all but a minuscule minority. The reality is that talent and education rarely prove enough to propel you out of poverty. </p> <p>Second, Catalyst's paper challenges the legitimacy of a meritocracy: why should the banker be vastly richer than the nurse or street-cleaner? Is it right that market forces are left to determine the price of individuals' labour? Is it right that the individual banker claims as his or her due such a huge share of wealth created by a society that depends on so many other people's less well-rewarded labour? The banker may gamble successfully on the stock market, but whose labour ensures he returns to his desk healthy after his hernia operation? Whose labour ensures that his desk is not buried under a mountain of rubbish and life-threatening mouldy coffee cups on his return? </p> <p>These were the big debates of Labour's 20th century, and the child poverty targets are going to reopen all of them. That's because the next levels of child poverty are not going to be amenable to the interventions the government has used so far. The welfare-to-work principles of the first term are looking pretty shabby. </p> <p>Take the familiar mantra, \"work is the best route out of poverty\": more than half the children in this country living in poverty have a parent in work. For more than a million parents, working has not proved a route out of poverty. Or take another popular mantra, \"work for those who can, support for those who can't\": the latter part of that equation has simply not materialised. Benefits ensure recipients are below poverty levels, cruelly penalising those who can't get into work. Among the poorest households in the UK, lone parents, people with a disability (either child or parent) and ethnic minorities (of which more later) are disproportionately represented. </p> <p>Where New Labour's agendas of welfare to work and equal opportunity have neatly dovetailed is on the expansion of childcare provision. Childcare would help parents into work and, at the same time, improve the child's life chances, runs the logic. Robin Cook, at a conference fringe, went as far as declaring that childcare will be the key to alleviating child poverty. But let's not delude ourselves with false expectations. Childcare may help parents get into work, but not out of poverty, and the claims advanced for it on improved life chances have been inflated. It's hard to see how a private-sector childcare system like the UK's can deliver the social benefits of the Scandinavian state systems. Childcare is not a cheap sticking plaster to cover up sharp economic inequality. </p> <p>And that brings me to the most urgent aspect of the child-poverty agenda. Welfare-to-work and childcare policies have had near-zero impact on Britain's poorest communities. Seventy per cent of Bangladeshi and Pakistani children in this country are living in poverty, a rate which is two-and-a-half times that of white children and well ahead of black Caribbeans (41%). The poverty rates among Bangladeshi and Pakistani children with a working parent are higher than among white children with no working parent. For these ethnic minority families, the promise that work is a route out of poverty has been a cruel deception. </p> <p>Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are worse off than other ethnic minority groups on every indicator of deprivation except for educational achievement - where they get higher results than their poverty would predict, and stay on after 16 in high proportions. The problems are concentrated in certain places, such as Tower Hamlets in east London - home to half of Britain's Bangladeshi community and where more than half of all children are living in poverty - and parts of the Midlands and north-west. Manufacturing decline has crippled the aspirations of the generation of migrant workers who arrived to work in the 1960s. Our economic history betrayed them, and now they find themselves stranded in areas of high unemployment and trapped in cheap housing. </p> <p>This is the most acute part of the child-poverty agenda because the age structure of these communities is one of the youngest in the country - the children now living in poverty will be having their own children over the next two decades. Will they hand on the legacy of deprivation they have themselves inherited? Only their struggle for educational achievement provides any grounds for optimism, and if that fails to reap rewards, by 2010 we could be wringing our hands at the emergence of a radicalised Muslim underclass. Just don't say we didn't see it coming. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Why Inequality Matters by Ben Jackson and Paul Segal is published by Catalyst </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Sexier than most in-built car stereos with its satin chrome and black finish and custom built \"ice white\" backlit LCD screen, the REVO will certainly look the part if you drive a Mercedes or a Porsche, but a little out of place if you're behind the wheel of a Ford Focus. It'll plug into your Bang &amp; Olufsen on its aluminium REVO dock without stylistically jarring. Not quite iPod portable, but only the weedy should struggle with its 185g weight. </p> <p><strong> Wow or ugh?</strong> Wow, but you pay for it. The car model costs \u00a3200 then there's an extra \u00a350 installation fee. The home docking kit costs an additional \u00a350 and if you want the portable option - you've guessed it - it's another \u00a350. So if you want the all-singing, all-dancing option be prepared to part with at least \u00a3350 and even then you don't get a true portable - listening is restricted to \"ear bud\" headphones until next year's speaker pack arrives. </p> <p><strong> When can I get one?</strong> The REVO debuts at a London motor show next month before going on retail sale at the beginning of December.</p>"
