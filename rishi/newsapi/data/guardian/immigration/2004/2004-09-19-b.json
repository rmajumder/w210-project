  "<p> <strong>4.45pm:</strong> Welcome to Oakland Hills for the decisive Sunday singles matches. Hal Sutton has adopted an interesting strategy for his line-up, putting his players in the order they qualified then throwing in his two wild card picks at the bottom. Hardly rocket science then. Bern-Hard Langer has mixed his experienced players with his rookies throughout the line-up, so there are some fascinating match-ups.</p> <p>The action begins in a quarter of an hour with Tiger Woods taking on Paul Casey in one of the games of the day. Casey, ranked 27 in the world, will certainly not be overawed by the prospect, but Sutton will be hoping to reduce the deficit early on with his star player. With Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia facing off next, it promises to be some day. </p> <p>Europe need just three points to retain the cup, and three and a half to win it outright. The US overcame a 10-6 Saturday night scoreline to win in Brookline in 1999, but whether this American team has the same determination and ability remains to be seen. I've got my chicken and stuffing baguette with me for my tea, so I'm ready. I hope you all are too.</p> <p> <strong>Singles line-ups:</strong> </p> <p> Paul Casey v Tiger Woods <br> Sergio Garcia v Phil Mickelson <br> Darren Clarke v Davis Love <br> David Howell v Jim Furyk <br> Lee Westwood v Kenny Perry <br> Colin Montgomerie v David Toms <br> Luke Donald v Chad Campbell <br> Miguel Angel Jimenez v Chris DiMarco <br> Thomas Levet v Fred Funk <br> Ian Poulter v Chris Riley <br> Padraig Harrington v Jay Haas<br> Paul McGinley v Stewart Cink <br></p> <p><strong>5.02pm:</strong> Two shots gone, advantage to Europe. Tiger Woods drilled his tee-shot into the deep rough - well, as deep as it gets in Detroit. To rub salt into the wounds, Casey whacked his into A1 position. It really would deflate the American optimism if the Englishman could win this first hole.</p> <p><strong>5.10pm:</strong> Woods plays a good recovery shot to land next to Casey on the green. Casey putts first, leaving himself a tricky four-footer for par. Woods' putt is good enough for a gimme. The cheers on the first hole are now not for Woods, but for his team-mate (team associate might be a more fitting word) Phil Mickelson. Big Phil is far more popular with the locals than the aloof Woods.</p> <p><strong>5.15pm:</strong> Casey displays a sign of nerves and misses his putt to halve the hole, putting Woods one up. Casey still doesn't look too flustered though amid the neanderthal cries of \"U S A\". Garcia, meanwhile, smashes his drive just off the fairway from the first tee, and Mickelson sends his flying wildly right of the intended target. </p> <p>So to Rob Hisnay, who, as the first person to email me on this momentous day, deserves to be heard: \"Are Kraftwerk in Detroit to play 'Europe Endless' for Hal Sutton?\" There's no evidence to the contrary, so let's say yes.</p> <p><strong>5.22pm:</strong> Both Casey and his illustrious opponent Woods are making a meal of the par-five second hole. Casey's drive ended in a fairway bunker, from which he could only chip out twenty yards. Woods, in the rough after his drive, also fluffed his second and his ball is waiting for him in the sand.</p> <p>Mickelson and Garcia are also making the amateur players in the crowd feel better about themselves by making a right pig's ear of the opening hole. Mickelson has just played his fourth shot to around six feet from the cup, so a bogey is not even guaranteed. Garcia is in a bunker after two shots, so if he can get down in a further two from there, the hole is the Spaniard's.</p> <p>So to Darren Clarke and Davis Love on the first tee. The Ulsterman hit such a cracker that even some of the Americans ventured to applaud it. Don't hand Clarke a cigar just yet though, as Love is also in a pretty good position. A fan's cry of \"Get in the hole\" immediately after Love's driver had made contact with the ball was somewhat premature. Not to mention idiotic. </p> <p><strong>5.28pm:</strong> Sergio missed his putt for a par, and Mickelson just about read the contours of the green correctly for a bogey, so the pair move on to the second tee all square.</p> <p>Woods, meanwhile, could only manage a par at the second, so Casey has a chance to halve the hole if he can make his eight foot putt for a five.</p> <p><strong>5.29pm:</strong> Casey rattles it into the hole, so he remains only one down. Hopefully that will settle him. I must say I fancy him to avoid defeat in this match, though they could be famous last words. Apologies if they are.</p> <p><strong>5.32pm:</strong> Jim Furyk and David Howell are next up for the ordeal of the first tee, but before that they must have the obligatory photograph. After an hour on the driving range, not to mention several hours of unrelenting nerves, you finally arrive at the first tee just wanting to hurry on with things, and some official demands a flaming photograph. Let's hope Big Phil's was a good'un, as he's having a torrid time on the course. Now he has found a bunker from the tee at the second hole. </p> <p><strong>5.36pm:</strong> Both Woods and Casey missed the green with their tee shots on the par-three third, and Casey has overplayed his second from the rough.</p> <p>Darren Clarke and Davis Love have halved the first hole in pars. This could be the highest quality match of them all.</p> <p><strong>5.39pm:</strong> Woods has missed a putt for par to take the third hole, with Casey nailing another tester from about eight feet.</p> <p>Mickelson has shown his exceptional array of shots, recovering from his dreadful drive to achieve a birdie at the second. Garcia halved the hole with a solid chip and putt.</p> <p>Mark Curry asks: \"Is there any truth to the rumours that a number of 'Euro' players (as the US press likes to coin a name of the opponents) past and present are keen to invite the USGA to solicit a Nafta ruling and hence invite Mexican and Canadian players in to help bolster the depth of team USA for future cups? The embarrassment of having to thump the Ameros like this every two years might well be a factor.\" </p> <p>Well, it certainly has been rumoured, but whether there is any truth to it, I'm not so sure. We could even go back to the match being America against Britain and Ireland. After all, only three of this year's European team are from the continent. That would be equally humiliating for \"U S A\".</p> <p><strong> 5.47pm:</strong> Tiger has played a fine approach to the fourth green, which has brough a new exclamation from the rednecks in the crowd: \"Come on bayby, yee-hah, come on bayby.\" Oh my word.</p> <p><strong>5.49pm:</strong> Sergio has bogeyed the third hole, gifting Big Phil the lead. Love has also moved ahead against Clarke with a birdie at the second. There's only red on the board at the moment, as Furyk is also beating Howell. Never fear, though, our saviour Colin Montgomerie will be on the course shortly.</p> <p><strong>5.51pm:</strong> Casey's determination has just increased ten-fold. As he prepared for his third shot, someone who should be ejected from the grounds shouted out, causing the debutant to demand he be silent. Casey proceeded to make an excellent up and down, so is still just one behind. He's yet to find his rhythm, but he is not relinquishing his loose grip on the Tiger's tail.</p> <p><strong>5.56pm:</strong> Kenny Perry and Lee Westwood are all square through one after both players had birdie putts which pretended they were going to enter the cup, only to tease their masters and choose to stay just by the hole. The cheeky beggars.</p> <p><strong>5.59pm:</strong> Casey really is having a rough ride with his audience. After his approach landed in a perilous position, the crowds erupted as if they had just won the whole blimming competition. What other nation would celebrate the sporting hardship of an opponent? What's that? Middle class Britain when Tim Henman plays anyone at Wimbledon? Oh.</p> <p><strong>6.02pm:</strong> Europe has won its first hole of the day. Darren Clarke shook off the nerves to knock his putt right into the middle of the hole at the third. David Howell, on the other hand, has made a disappointing start, and is two down to Jim Furyk.</p> <p>Aha, here he comes. Big Monty steps up to the tee with a face of fierce Scottish determination, and whallops his drive straight down the fairway. The European team needs such inspiration right now.</p> <p><strong>6.05pm:</strong> Casey continues to struggle - he has now bogeyed three of the first five holes. Woods has been barely more consistent, but a confident five-foot putt for five hands the world No2 a two-hole lead. </p> <p><strong>6.08pm:</strong> Colin Montgomerie, what a hero you are. With a huge Saltire waving in the crowd, Monty stepped up to the plate and sent his ball on the way to a fine birdie at the first. David Toms might have a tough day ahead of him.</p> <p>Andy Kocen says: \"Could you send a big plea to whoever runs the power networks in London NW3 to get a move on and restore my electricity. Not that I'm unhappy watching your web updates and would rather watch it on TV - it's that my laptop battery will run out in only an hour's time. In the meantime, I'd like to suggest that the Euros start chanting 'EU, EU' when things go well as part of some kind of counter-idiocy and a taste of their own medicine.\" A good idea, Andy. How about, \"We're on the march with Monty's army etc.\" as well? </p> <p><strong>6.12pm:</strong> Woods has more or less driven the sixth green, which stands 320 yards from the tee. I can barely see that far let alone hit a golf ball that far.</p> <p>Now then, Sergio has a putt to regain all-square status with Phil Mickelson after Big Phil sent his birdie putt on one of those long trips around the green before finally descending the slope towards the hole. After a few hundred grips and re-grips, Sergio finally takes his club back, but the ball at no stage looks on the correct line.</p> <p><strong>6.15pm:</strong> In response to Tiger's awesome drive, Casey plays a phenomenal bunker shot to within inches of the hole. He's covered in sand from head to toe, but it was worth it. The shot hardly raises a flicker from the partisan fans.</p> <p>Lee Westwood has raced ahead of Kenny Perry in the fifth match. He is now, erm, one up after two. Unfortunately, I nipped downstairs to buy a Mars bar, so I'm afraid I can't tell you how or why.</p> <p><strong>6.20pm:</strong> Bad news for Europe: Kenny Perry has pulled back Westwood's lead with a birdie at the short third, and David Howell has fallen further adrift of Jim Furyk. Three holes to be exact. I advised one of my mates that Howell was a great bet for his match. I don't think he'll be too pleased.</p> <p>The brilliantly named Robin Pharoah tells me: \"My flatmate and I countered the chants of 'Yoo-Ess-Eh?' (U.S.A - we presume) with 'Yoo-War-Op' (Europe). We sounded cool.\" Good on ya.</p> <p><strong>Latest scores:</strong></p> <p>Paul Casey 6 Tiger Woods <strong>2 up</strong><br> Sergio Garcia 5 Phil Mickelson <strong>1 up</strong> <br> <strong>A/S</strong> Darren Clarke 4 Davis Love <strong>A/S</strong><br> David Howell 3 Jim Furyk <strong> 2 up</strong><br> <strong>1 up</strong> Lee Westwood 2 Kenny Perry <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Colin Montgomerie 1 David Toms <br> Luke Donald v Chad Campbell <br> Miguel Angel Jimenez v Chris DiMarco <br> Thomas Levet v Fred Funk <br> Ian Poulter v Chris Riley <br> Padraig Harrington v Jay Haas<br> Paul McGinley v Stewart Cink <br></p> <p><strong>6.27pm:</strong> Davis Love is back in charge of his match with Darren Clarke. The man with a Billy Idol haircut was unable to find the white with his putt from the edge of the green to earn a half.</p> <p>David Toms has just made a 25-foot putt to put Monty under pressure to hole his. The Scot's ball is on its way... it's moving very slowly down the hill... very slowly indeed... still going... but it's off line, so they're back to all square. America currently lead the top four matches and the next three are level. It's worryingly reminiscent of the surge the US made at Brookline.</p> <p><strong>6.33pm:</strong> Sergio and Big Phil are quietly making their way around the course. They're now both on the seventh with birdie opportunities.</p> <p>Clarke is beginning to faulter. He has just missed another lengthy putt for half, and is two holes behind.</p> <p>\"Hey, less of the Mars Bars!\" screams Eamonn from Dublin, who is clearly greatly concerned for my diet. He won't be pleased to hear that I've moved on to munching Hula Hoops.</p> <p><strong>6.37pm:</strong> Tiger and Casey look like they were out on the beers last night. The supposed second best player in the world is playing shots that Happy Gilmour would've been disappointed with before his fine-tuning. He has moved prematurely onto the ninth tee, premature as he hasn't passed through the eighth green yet. Sadly, Casey has been unable to capitalise as his play has been even more inauspicious.</p> <p> <strong>6.41pm:</strong> There's officially blue on the board, and unsurprisingly it's next to Monty's name. David Toms' putt from three feet travelled around the lip of the hole before slinging out in the opposite direction. Monty celebrated with a Tim Cahill-style shirt over his head sprint around the green.</p> <p>Luke Donald has made a solid start to his match, halving the first two holes with Chad Campbell. The easily dislikeable figure of Chris DiMarco and Miguel Angel Jimenez are also all square after the first hole - that's a match which could produce fireworks if it becomes crucial later on, as the fiery Spaniard will not stand for any of DiMarco's histrionics.</p> <p><strong>6.48pm:</strong> Luke Donald has lost the third hole, putting Chad Campbell one up in their match. Westwood has also slipped behind Kenny Perry, unnoticed by the director at Sky but not by my eagle-eyes. America are ahead in the top five matches. Jimenez, though, has won the second hole, and has played a good tee shot to the par-three third. Funk and Levet halved the first hole with pars.</p> <p>Woods and Casey continue to have messy rounds. They seem to have been on the eighth hole for a couple of hours, but finally they've agreed to pick up and move on after a pair of bogeys. if Casey was playing a strokeplay event, he would be four over after eight holes. That he is only two shots behind shows how poorly Woods is also playing.</p> <p><strong>Latest scores:</strong></p> <p>Paul Casey 8 Tiger Woods <strong>2 up</strong><br> Sergio Garcia 7 Phil Mickelson <strong>1 up</strong> <br> Darren Clarke 7 Davis Love <strong>2 up</strong><br> David Howell 5 Jim Furyk <strong>3 up</strong><br> Lee Westwood 5 Kenny Perry <strong>1 up</strong> <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Colin Montgomerie 4 David Toms <br> Luke Donald 3 Chad Campbell <strong>1 up</strong> <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Miguel Angel Jimenez 2 Chris DiMarco <br> <strong>A/S</strong> Thomas Levet 1 Fred Funk <strong>A/S</strong> <br> Ian Poulter v Chris Riley <br> Padraig Harrington v Jay Haas<br> Paul McGinley v Stewart Cink <br></p> <p><strong>6.58pm:</strong> The American fans are no longer just irritating, they are now even outright liars. Shortly after Tiger had sent his tee shot towards the ninth green, one moron shouted: \"It's in the hole.\" Clearly, it was not - it was in the air. Both Tiger and Casey parred the hole so Woods is two up at the turn.</p> <p>Sergio has dropped another hole to Big Phil with a bogey five. This match is yet to take off, though Mickelson won't be complaining.</p> <p>Westwood and Jimenez have missed short putts for halves, so Forest fan Lee is two down, and Jimenez is back to all square. The putts simply aren't dropping for Europe like they have in the past two days. </p> <p>Ian Poulter, though, has won the first hole against beanpole Chris Riley. Poulter has not yet been spotted by the television cameras, so an update on his dresswear will follow. Whatever he is wearing, it cannot be worse than the sickly light yellow slipover that Monty is sporting.</p> <p>\"Hula hoops?\" scoffs Elena Papazoglu. \"Pah, real men eat Monster Munch (though Monty Lite probably gives those a miss now).\" Yes, that's my excuse - I'm eating girlie crisps in honour of our dieting boys.</p> <p><strong>7.02pm:</strong> Sergio has holed his first putt of any real distance at the short ninth, and so heads to the back nine one hole behind Mickelson. Clarke has also pulled a hole back on Davis Love. Commentator Butch Harmon is trying to assure viewers that those two are best pals, but I'm not so sure.</p> <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> David Howell is four down after seven against Jim Furyk. That looks like a given point to the US. Kenny Perry, who was lucky to actually make contact with the ball at times on Saturday and Sunday, is in great nick today, and has just holed a winding putt for a half with Westwood.</p> <p>But Monty is two holes clear of David Toms after a well-judged putt across the slopes - nay, hills - of the sixth green.</p> <p>Niall Lambert observes: \"Looking at your photo, it must get pretty monotonous at the team wife-swapping do.\" Unfortunately, I have since changed the photo to a rather charming pic of Elin Nordegren, but you can see what he was hinting at.</p> <p><strong>7.12pm:</strong> Furyk five up against Howell. Need I say more on that one? More seriously, Jay Haas, 94, has won the first hole against Padraig Harrington. Come on Porridge!</p> <p>Peter Richards may have a point, though I can't tell you what it is: \"It's not 'EU -EU...' It's 'EUR' as in 'ere you are' which, in response to all the yee-hah, should - er - What I'm saying is, the US doesn't have a monopoly on morons. It may very well look that way from where you all are now, but don't we know different?(ly)\" Make of that what you will. </p> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> Sergio has pulled level with Mickelson with an absolute beauty of a putt for a birdie at the tenth - the first time I've felt the necessity to cheer out loud. The tension is starting to build and it looks like Europe's Ryder Cup veterans are going to have to be the ones to pick up the required points.</p> <p> <strong>7.17pm:</strong> A good couple of minutes for the Irish contingent at Oakland Hills - McGinley wins the first hole and Harrington secures an eagle to draw level with Haas.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm:</strong> Lee Westwood is just one down again after a surprisingly generous concession from Kenny Perry.</p> <p>Sergio Garcia, who has never won a Ryder Cup singles match, could be about to win his third hole in a row after a splendid approach to the 11th green left him with a three of four-foot putt for a birdie. Mickelson wil have to hole from just off the front of the green, unless a fan runs on and chucks it a bit nearer.</p> <p><strong>Latest scores:</strong></p> <p>Paul Casey 11 Tiger Woods <strong>2 up</strong><br> <strong>A/S</strong> Sergio Garcia 10 Phil Mickelson <strong>A/S</strong> <br> Darren Clarke 9 Davis Love <strong>1 up</strong><br> David Howell 8 Jim Furyk <strong>5 up</strong><br> Lee Westwood 7 Kenny Perry <strong>2 up</strong> <br> <strong>2 up</strong> Colin Montgomerie 7 David Toms <br> Luke Donald 6 Chad Campbell <strong>2 up</strong> <br> <strong>A/S</strong> Miguel Angel Jimenez 4 Chris DiMarco <strong>A/S</strong> <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Thomas Levet 4 Fred Funk <br> <strong>A/S</strong>Ian Poulter 2 Chris Riley <strong>A/S</strong> <br> <strong>A/S</strong> Padraig Harrington 2 Jay Haas <strong>A/S</strong> <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Paul McGinley 1 Stewart Cink <br></p> <p><strong>7.30pm:</strong> Sergio holes his putt to charge one ahead. \"Ser-gi-o!\" </p> <p>Westwood has just chipped from just off the treacherous green, but his ball has chosen to be awkward and roll away to end up further from the hole than it started. The little blighter.</p> <p><strong>7.33pm:</strong> The Europeans have recovered the situation a little bit. If the matches were to finish now, America would win 6.5 points, Europe 5.5 - more than enough. But, of course, it's not over until the musical trio of Westwood, Clarke and Monty have bit of a sing-song.</p> <p>Niall Lambert points out the first rule of matchplay: \"Try to beat the hell out of your opponent in the first few holes. Once you're ahead you can go back to the conservative stuff and let the other guy try to pull something out with an increasingly fewer number of opportunities. Looks like the Septics have taken that one to heart. (Monty lives by it. And I'm surprised by Clarke. I thought he'd be eating the lunch of a big fairy like Davis Love III.)\" Niall, you could have let the Europeans know about this tactical innovation.</p> <p><strong>7.37pm:</strong> Only seconds after Clarke sends his ball zig-zagging across the 11th green into the cup, Love does exactly the same to stay one up. These two are playing as well as anyone today.</p> <p>Woods has moved into a surely unassailable lead of three up with sixth to play thanks to an eagle at the 12th. Cue \"U S blah blah blah\".</p> <p>McGinley is two up after three against Stewart Cink, who was unable to sink his ball into the hole from five feet. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>7.42pm:</strong> Porn-star wanabee Miguel Angel Jimenez sends his ball snaking across the slippery green... and into the hole. Can Chris \"I'm American you know\" DiMarco match that?</p> <p><strong>7.44pm:</strong> No he cannot. What a shame. At the 12th, Garcia has a chance for a fourth birdie in four holes. Meanwhile, you'll be pleased to know that, according to the commentators, David Howell still seems to be enjoying playing in the Ryder Cup, even if he is five down! Bless.</p> <p> <strong>7.51pm:</strong> This is not a sick joke: David Howell has won, yes won, a hole against Jim Furyk. He's only four down now. Could the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history be on the cards? Unlikely. With Paul Casey three down with five to play against Woods, and Luke Donald now three behind Chad Campbell after eight holes, this is not proving to be the best day for the English rookies. </p> <p>Another debutant, Ian Poulter, is still all square against Chris Riley though. Incidentally, did anyone else think that the deifying of Riley for winning a match in the, admittedly undesirable, company of Woods was a bit over the top?</p> <p> <strong>7.57pm:</strong> The Irish army trailing McGinley and Harrington are enjoying the craic, as they are three up and one up respectively. \"Oh Danny Boy...\" The Spanish contingent have plenty to celebrate too, as Sergio is two up against Big Phil, who has that familiar nervous little smirk on his face. </p> <p>If the scores remain as they are, a big if I know, Europe will win 17-11 - a real drubbing.</p> <p>\"Is there any truth to the rumour,\" begins Mark Curry, immediately implying there isn't any, \"that Karl Rove, director of the US prez reelection campaign for the elephant team, has split the ticket regarding the current disaster zones: the prez has been sent to Florida to survey the storm damage while a posse of neo-cons is being herded together to try to fix the Detroit township golf problem?\" Well, is there?</p> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> With Jimenez showing a steely nerve to hole an eight-foot putt for par, and Poulter making a birdie to shoot into the lead against Riley, Europe are ahead in the last five matches. Sergio has an advantage over Big Phil on the 14th green - could this be a fifth win in six holes for Sergio? Big Phil's smirk is gradually evolving into a quivering lip - where's wife Amy when he needs a hug?</p> <p><strong>Latest scores:</strong></p> <p>Paul Casey 14 Tiger Woods <strong>3 up</strong><br> <strong>2 up</strong> Sergio Garcia 13 Phil Mickelson <br> Darren Clarke 13 Davis Love <strong>1 up</strong><br> David Howell 11 Jim Furyk <strong>4 up</strong><br> Lee Westwood 11 Kenny Perry <strong>1 up</strong> <br> <strong>2 up</strong> Colin Montgomerie 10 David Toms <br> Luke Donald 9 Chad Campbell <strong>3 up</strong> <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Miguel Angel Jimenez 8 Chris DiMarco <br> <strong>3 up</strong> Thomas Levet 7 Fred Funk <br> <strong>1 up</strong>Ian Poulter 7 Chris Riley <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Padraig Harrington 5 Jay Haas <br> <strong>3 up</strong> Paul McGinley 4 Stewart Cink <br></p> <p><strong>8.13pm:</strong> Garcia was unable to convert his good position into another victory, but his par was enough to match Big Phil's. Chad Campbell has taken another hole against Luke Donald. He's four up with eight to play, so we can probably give America that point.</p> <p>French superhero Thomas levet, meanwhile, is three up in his match, though Sky, and myself, have refused to comment on it, much to the chagrin of Michael Cassidy. \"If Thomas Levet is one up that probably means he's won a hole.\" Erm, three now, Michael. Sorry. \"When? How? I'm as big a Monty fan as anyone but this is a team event (oh yes, and I do live in France). You should start talking about him 'cos my sneaking feeling is that he's gonna win it for us!\" You could be right.</p> <p><strong>8.19pm:</strong> Howell's comeback was as shortlived as America's promises to be. He is now five down with five to play, which by anybody's reckoning is a hopeless position to be in. Westwood, Lee not Richard, has clawed back the deficit against Kenny Perry to all square, but Clarke is tiring in his fifth successive match, and has fallen two behind Davis Love with only four holes to play. </p> <p>Comically, it looks as though the US are going to edge close towards our current total of 11 points, offering them real hope, only for Europe to pull away into the distance in the end.</p> <p>Matthew Renshaw has emailed in: \"A question for the punters: who would win in a fight between the two teams (captains allowed to join in). Or perhaps singles fights. We think Europe, by two at least.\" Europe certainly has youth and weight on its side, though some of the Americans, notably Jim Furyk, look as though they've been in a few rucks before.</p> <p><strong>USA 6 - 11 EUROPE (Woods beat Casey 3&amp;2)</strong></p> <p>Casey never settled after three-putting on the first green, and although Woods was far from his best, he was too strong for the young Englishman. The world No2 has done what his captain asked, i.e. win, but it is unlikely to be enough.</p> <p><strong>USA 7 - 11 EUROPE (Furyk beat Howell 6&amp;4)</strong></p> <p>Another English rookie bites the dust. Furyk wins the 14th hole to secure a victory which was as inevitable as me missing the winning putt to buy another Mars bar. Howell was all over the place from the first hole, and with Furyk determined to seek revenge for his four losses in the first two days, this was no contest.</p> <p><strong>8.33pm:</strong> Sergio could be about to wrap up his first Ryder Cup singles victory after Mickelson thrashed his second shot into the water at the 16th. Big Phil has been in terrbile form this week, and the Spaniard has capitalised brilliantly.</p> <p>Monty has won the 13th hole to send him one up once more against Toms. This one is turning out to be a battle of attrition. </p> <p>Keith Brazil says: \"I heard that if the Europeans win (if??), their wives are going to run onto the final green and widdle in unison in response to the American wives' actions from a few years back. Please confirm.\" Confirmed.</p> <p><strong>USA 7 - 12 EUROPE (Garcia beat Mickelson 3&amp;2)</strong></p> <p>Sergio's arms are aloft and his ball is in the crowd. Nope, he hasn't lost his temper with the American crowd, he's just beaten Big Phil. A wonderful performance to come from behind against the American No2.</p> <p><strong>8.46pm:</strong> Darren Clarke has kept his match alive on the 16th green with a gutsy seven-foot putt (approximately, it could have been 14 feet for all I know). With Clarke's ball now firmly set just off the 17th green while Love's lies in a nearby bunker, the cigar-puffer still has hope of a point.</p> <p>Swings and roundabouts in the bottom matches, with Levet dropping a hole, but McGinley picking another one up. </p> <p>Niall Lambert is desperately pleading with me to get a picture of Kristen Scott Thomas. Why, I'm not entirely sure. But I'll see what I can do, Niall.</p> <p><strong>Latest scores:</strong></p> <p>Paul Casey <strong>LOST TO</strong> Tiger Woods <strong>3&amp;2</strong><br> <strong>3&amp;2</strong> Sergio Garcia <strong>BEAT</strong> Phil Mickelson <br> Darren Clarke 16 Davis Love <strong>1 up</strong><br> David Howell <strong>LOST TO</strong> Jim Furyk <strong>6&amp;4</strong><br> <strong>A/S</strong> Lee Westwood 14 Kenny Perry <strong>A/S</strong> <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Colin Montgomerie 14 David Toms <br> Luke Donald 13 Chad Campbell <strong>4 up</strong> <br> <strong>A/S</strong> Miguel Angel Jimenez 12 Chris DiMarco <strong>A/S</strong> <br> <strong>2 up</strong> Thomas Levet 11 Fred Funk <br> <strong>1 up</strong> Ian Poulter 10 Chris Riley <br> <strong>2 up</strong> Padraig Harrington 9 Jay Haas <br> <strong>4 up</strong> Paul McGinley 8 Stewart Cink <br></p> <p><strong>8.52pm:</strong> A marvellously delicate chip from Clarke trickles into the hole to draw him level with Love. The aptly name American, to his credit, offers his congratulations to the Ulsterman. On the 18th, Clarke's drive has found the fairway, but Love's has been merely found wanting.</p> <p>Chris DiMarco has just missed a four-foot putt to pull all square against Jimenez. Terribly hard luck. By the by, it is noticeable that the commentators have begun to use the first person plural pronoun. Nobody likes such clearly biased commentary, do they?</p> <p><strong>8.59pm:</strong> Moments ago Luke Donald's participation in this year's Ryder Cup was millimetres away from ending when Chad Campbell's putt dribbled next to the hole. Donald will have to journey to the 15th before he is put out of his misery.</p> <p>Having won the 15th, Lee Westwood has halved the 16th with Kenny Perry.

  "<p>I started travelling in utero - my parents were diplomats, and although I'm Canadian I was born in Spain. When I was very young we moved to Portugal, then Alaska, British Columbia, Ottowa, Costa Rica then France, Mexico, Paris ... Change became a habit and I've travelled constantly ever since.</p> <p> In my early twenties I travelled for the sake of it - it really didn't matter where I went. One of my most memorable trips was to Turkey. It's a crossroads of civilisations; Ararat is supposedly where Noah's Ark landed, Santa Claus was in fact a Turkish bishop, Greek philosophy began here, Troy was in Turkey. It's an amazing country. The second most amazing country I've been to - after India. </p> <p>In my early thirties that kind of travel felt too much like drifting and so I started travelling with a purpose, such as research. I knew India was cheap, varied and beautiful and I thought I could settle for a while to write a novel, but that novel fizzled out. I was 32 or 33 and felt I'd done nothing with my life. Then I thought of Life of Pi and found a reason to be there. The rest of my trip was broadly for research. I had a reason to go into Hindu Temples, to spend days on end in Indian zoos, to listen to how people spoke, to observe things and spend time in certain places. </p> <p>When I'm writing I need to be in a stable setting. After the research in India I started Life of Pi in France and wrote most of it in Montreal. For my next novel I'm thinking about settling in the Azores to write - they're supposed to be beautiful islands and not too touristy. </p> <p>Pi has taken me now to roughly 20 countries. We were invited to a literary festival in Iceland for a week, which was great. We spent time in Reykjavik, borrowed my publisher's car and went to see a volcano and explore the island. I've been to Hong Kong, Portugal, Spain, UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Italy, Greece, Mexico, US, Canada. Sometimes it's ridiculous: I flew from Montreal to Greece, had 36 hours in Greece then flew to New York. That's a different kind of travel altogether - that's jet setting, and the country really is a backdrop. It was exhausting but thrilling. </p> <p>The foreign wears you down eventually and I have to go back to Canada occasionally. It's the little things you miss: the accents, the attitudes. And I miss the variety of Canadian weather. When it's winter, it's really winter. When it's summer, it's hot and humid. Everything is green in spring and the leaves are a gorgeous colour in autumn. I spent a year in Mexico City once and it was 20C every day. It's ideal, but after a year it becomes boring and I missed the Canadian seasons.</p> <p> My next novel will broadly speaking come from the Holocaust. I spent New Year's Eve 2002, right after winning the Booker Prize, in a hostel in the town of Oswiecim (Auschwitz was the German name). I spent New Year's Day - this dazzlingly brilliant, but stunningly cold day - in Auschwitz which was covered with snow and was a beautiful, horrible place. I was trying to extract something I could write about, and I'll probably go back to Poland and maybe Israel to do more research. </p> <p>You have to open your mind when you travel. I've met people who have travelled widely but it's clearly changed nothing. Travel for them has been nothing more than a movie in front of their eyes. For me, solitary travel is the pure travel experience, but there are as many ways of travelling as ways of eating; as many trips as there are foods. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Yann Martel's collection of short stories, The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios (Canongate, \u00a39.99), is out now.</p>",
  "<p>Walkers, ramblers, hikers and strollers will rise this morning with a spring in their stride: after 120 years of bills, campaigns, protests and arrests surrounding the right to roam, new laws come into force today giving us all access to vast tracts of British countryside hitherto off-limits. </p> <p>This initial phase of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act gives access to open, uncultivated land - specifically, mountain, moor, heath and down - in two regions, the south-east and, predominantly, the lower north-west of England. Over the next 18 months new access will be rolled out in areas including Cumbria, Manchester, Merseyside, Staffordshire, Kent, Surrey, East and West Sussex and nine London boroughs south of the Thames. 'You now have a legally protected right to explore some of the wildest and most beautiful places in Britain,' says Nick Barrett, chief executive of the Ramblers' Association. </p> <p>Ordnance Survey is revising all its Explorer maps that cover the affected regions. A spokesman says the three biggest new open-access areas are in the lower north-west: the High Peak District (22,611 hectares), Saddleworth Moor (18,575) and Burrow Hill (18,497). The total area of new access land in national parks alone will be the size of Luxembourg. </p> <p>'The wild places of Britain are our national heritage,' says Barrett. 'Who can own a mountain? At the end of the day we should all be able to climb it.' </p> <p>From Derbyshire to Sussex, we present our choice of walks in the new open areas. </p> <p><strong> Yorkshire/ Derbyshire border</strong><br> </p> <p>There's fine wilderness walking on the new-access moorlands that run for 17 miles along the South Yorkshire/Derbyshire border, from Snailsden Moor down to the Eastern Moors. Loping landscapes of heather and peat bog unravel to reveal bizarre rock formations of coarse gritstone. Bronze-Age burial mounds and neolithic standing stones rise all around. Carnivorous plants live among the expanses of moss and grass, and blue skies can dissolve into blizzards in a few gusty minutes. (This is map-and-compass territory.) </p> <p>Park in the village of Bradfield and make a day of it, heading up Wilkin Hill to New Cross - all new access land - where a medieval cross is believed to mark a 'corpse road' along which the dead were once carried from long-gone moorland hamlets to Bradfield Parish Church. Proceed to the Edge for sweeping views of Derwent Valley, then back down to the Strines Inn (0114 285 1247) for frothy late afternoon refreshment. </p> <p><strong> South Downs 1</strong><br> </p> <p> In Sussex, isolated parcels of downland are being made accessible by the act. As of today, visitors to Devil's Dyke - site of an Iron Age fort with a pub at the top - can bash off across new tracts, beyond well-trodden designated paths. The South Downs delivers sensational scenery: chalklands and escarpments rippling steeply north and south towards the sea, begging to be scaled with a picnic hamper. For a leisurely two-hour hike, park at the top of Springhead Hill and walk west along the escarpment, taking in Rackham Hill (193m). From here the whole of West Sussex spreads out north of you, the land below all new open access. Descend to the Sportsman in Amberley (01798 831 787) for pt\u00e9 and poached chicken breast then retrace your steps back. </p> <p><strong> South Downs 2</strong><br> </p> <p> Another South Downs walk combining new and existing access takes in Kipling's 'blunt, bow-headed, whale-backed downs'. From Poynton village, ascend the chalk escarpment across open-access National Trust land to Devil's Dyke. From here, the view north over the North Downs is lovely, and remains with you most of the way. From Devil's Dyke walk west across the top of new open-access land towards the South Downs Way National Trail - the very steep land to the right of you is open access and you can walk on it as far as Edburton Hill. </p> <p>Further along, footpaths lead down the scarp slope to Fulking, where beer-battered haddock and chips awaits at the Shepherd and Dog (01273 857382). Work it off with a stiff walk back up the ridge. As you head along the South Downs Way, pass over Edburton Hill, around radio masts at Truleigh Hill and down. </p> <p>Through Tottington Barn you descend gently below Beeding Hill, with matchless views down over the village of Upper Beeding. </p> <p><strong> Bront\u00eb country</strong><br> </p> <p> Except for a single path up to it, Boulsworth Hill, in the heart of West Yorkshire's Bront\u00eb country, was always off-limits until now. Even Tom Stephenson, who conceived the famous Pennine Way in 1930, failed in his attempt to route the walk over it. Amid rolling moorland and silvery streams, it has a symbolic significance for ramblers, who held several protest rallies here in the 1980s and 1990s - hence the celebratory event happening here today. Clamber 517m to the summit on a clear afternoon and see if you can make out Blackpool Tower - as it is fancifully claimed you can - way over to the west. It's best to work Boulsworth into a walk by parking at Wycoller, near Colne, from which the hill is a three-mile push along well-worn paths. Or start from Penistone Hill, near Haworth (aka Bront\u00ebville), en route passing the ruined Top Withins - long held to be titular home of the Earnshaws, in Emily's Wuthering Heights. </p> <p><strong> Peak District</strong><br> </p> <p> South of Buxton, in Derbyshire, Upper Dove Valley is an area of the Peak District rich in curious geomorphology. Reef-limestone knolls - among them Chrome and Parkhouse hills - rise to steep, sharpish peaks, quite mountain-like in appearance. (Strange as it may sound today, around 350 million years ago the whole area was a tropical lagoon.) Links between new access areas and existing rights of way are being sorted, providing beautiful walking opportunities and sensational views. </p> <p><strong> Bolton, Lancashire</strong><br> </p> <p> Smithills Moor, on the outskirts of Bolton, delivers walkers a pristine expanse of moorland carpeted in bilberries, heather, grasses and bracken. It is part of a 2,000-acre country park, dominated by Smithills Hall, which dates from the mid-14th century and is the oldest timber-framed manor house in Lancashire. The moor has drawn nature lovers for decades, thanks to access agreements with the owners - now it is on the conclusive map of open access land, and the distinctive walkers' signs are going up everywhere. Make for Winter Hill - at 456m the highest point of the region to the west of the Pennines - which merits the scramble for its views of glinting reservoirs, and Welsh mountains in the distance. </p> <p><strong> Garstang, Lancashire</strong><br> </p> <p> Bleasdale Fell, near Garstang in Lancashire, is one of a series of viewpoints looking west over the low agricultural country of the Fylde coastal plain. It forms part of a sporting country estate - peat expanses, grouse moor and dramatic fells rising behind the village of Bleasdale. Navigate your way up - maps will be available from village shops - and any level of walk is yours, from a two-hour hike then back down to the car, to a 15-20 mile hike up and down fell - truly wild country. The views are sensational, down across the farmlands of the Fylde coastal plain as far as the Lake District and mountains of North Wales. </p> <p>Recommended for post-hike sustenance is Guy's Thatched Hamlet (01995 640010), just south of Garstang off the A6: steak and kidney pie and a pint of Owd Nell's Cask Bitter. </p> <p><strong> Forest of Bowland</strong><br> </p> <p> In Lancashire's ancient royal hunting reserve, the Forest of Bowland, Mallowdale Pike offers wild walking for experienced map-readers. With its pointed profile it is one of the more prominent summits among the Bowland Fells, busy with ground-nesting birds (notably, this is the last significant habitat in Britain for supporting hen harriers - the logo of the Forest of Bowland). </p> <p>Accessed from Little Crag car park through seven miles of oak valleys and farmland, it is a tough 430m climb over millstone grit and peat expanses, but the experience of utter wilderness at the top is overwhelming, with Morecambe Bay and the southern lakes lying still and peaceful to the north. </p> <p>For a leaflet detailing new open-access circular walks in the area call 01772 534709. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>For further information about access across the whole of England visit <a href=\"http://www.countrysideaccess.gov.uk\">countrysideaccess.gov.uk</a>.

  "<p><strong>Letter of the week</strong><br></p> <p><strong>See family in Pakistan</strong></p> <p><strong> My son, his wife and children live in Islamabad. I really would like to see my grandchildren, so am planning to visit. I've been told that the best time is November to March. I'll be travelling on my own and would like to stay in a hotel.</strong><br> Margaret McLintock, Arbroath </p> <p>It's straightforward to arrange a trip to Islamabad - both PIA and British Airways fly direct from London several times a week, or you can connect via the Gulf. Fares start at around \u00a3500 including taxes - try Ebookers (0870 814 4001; <a href=\"http://www.ebookers.com\">ebookers.com</a> for reservations. The weather is cool and dry from November to February or March, but you might find nights feeling chilly - take some warm clothes just in case. </p> <p>Islamabad is a planned city built during the 1960s which, though it lacks major tourist attractions, is an interesting place to spend a few days. As well as being home to one of Asia's largest mosques and several good museums, the Margalla Hills National Park makes a pleasant day-trip from the city. </p> <p>The neighbouring city of Rawalpindi has the colourful Rajah Bazaar, which is a great place to wander. </p> <p>Islamabad has everything from budget hostels to luxury international-class hotels. Mid-range rooms with en-suite and TV will start at around \u00a315. If your son cannot suggest anywhere, Lonely Planet's new Pakistan &amp; the Karakoram Highway guide has lots of recommendations. A taxi from the airport to your hotel will cost only \u00a32-\u00a33. </p> <p><strong>Peru with a baby</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> My Peruvian wife and I, would like to take our newborn daughter to visit family in Cuzco. We are worried about the altitude and what affect this might have on one so young.</strong><br> Don McCaffrey, by email </p> <p>A baby will experience everything you will when flying straight from sea level to an elevation of 3,326m (10,910ft), including breathlessness, increased heart-rate and dizziness. This will be a confusing and disorienting experience for a traveller so young, as well as being unpleasant for you as parents. If you have to make this journey, fly into Lima (which is at sea level) and take at least a week, preferably longer, to ascend very slowly to Cuzco. You and your baby will benefit from the extra time to get used to the height. If she shows any signs of suffering from the altitude, consider descending immediately. If these preparations mean time runs short, you can always fly back from Cuzco to Lima. </p> <p>Alternatively, wait until your daughter is slightly older before making the trip; or see if you can get your family to meet you in Lima or elsewhere on the coast. </p> <p>It's essential you talk over your plans in greater detail with experts - the helpful Nomad Travel Store Travel Health Info Line (09068 633414) is a good place to start. </p> <p><strong>Niagara by rail</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> A buddy and I are hoping for a week in Toronto next summer (July/August) and would like to go via New York. Is it possible to take a train from Manhattan through New York state with a visit to Niagara Falls along the way? Advice and guidance would be much appreciated.</strong><br> Nicholas Baldwin, Bristol </p> <p>Amtrak's Maple Leaf service, which covers this route, is one of North America's classic train journeys. The trip from New York to Toronto takes around 12 hours and is a beautiful one, going up to Canada via the Hudson River Valley, the state capital of Albany, the Finger Lake gorges and the mighty Niagara Falls. OK, so trains leave from New York's functional Penn Station rather than the breathtaking Grand Central, but you'll still experience the excitement of arriving or leaving the Big Apple by shiny Amtrak train. </p> <p>Trains leave New York at 7.15am daily, arriving at Niagara Falls at 3.40pm on the American side of the water. Fares depend on when you travel and book, but you'll need to get a ticket from New York to the Falls, then another on to Toronto. </p> <p>For full details see the Amtrak website (<a href=\"http://www.amtrak.com\">amtrak.com</a>). Book tickets and accommodation well in advance. July and August are peak travel periods and Niagara Falls will be very busy. </p> <p><strong>Get organised in Libya</strong><br></p> <p><strong> For my 50th birthday in October I would like to go to Libya with my husband, travelling independently and hiring a car. We would like to visit Roman sites and maybe spend some time near the sea. We have about seven to 10 days. Would it be practical to fly to Egypt/Tunisia and would that be less expensive than flying to Libya?</strong><br> Rowan Collier, by email </p> <p>Independent travel is, at the time of writing, still impossible in Libya. You must have a visa to travel and visas are granted only to tourists on an organised tour. This leaves two options - go with a UK company or use a Libyan travel agency. </p> <p>Steppes East (01285 651010; <a href=\"http://www.steppeseast.co.uk\">steppeseast.co.uk</a>) can organise tailor-made itineraries - a seven-day trip starts at around \u00a32,900. Local tours will work out cheaper but generally require four people to make up a group. Readers recommend using Arkno Tours (<a href=\"http://www.arkno.com\">arkno.com)</a> - its UK representative is Caravanserai Tours (020 8855 6373). </p> <p>It can be a headache to organise travel via Tunisia or Egypt and you should check in advance if you can begin your tour at the border. Car hire can be prohibitively expensive and you'll generally need to be accompanied by your tour guide, so if you do get free time to explore it works out better value to hire a taxi. </p> <p>Despite all the regulations, Libya is a tremendously rewarding country to visit. The ancient remains of Leptis Magna, Sabratha and Cyrene, mixed with spectacular Sahara scenery and miles of beaches, give the country huge tourism potential. Going now, despite all the restrictions, ensures you'll beat the crowds. </p> <p> <strong>Over to you ... readers' feedback</strong></p> <p><strong> I was horrified by Kelly Taylor's plan to emigrate to Australia overland via the Trans-Siberian railway with an 18-month-old in tow.</strong> (5 September)<br> She acknowledges such a trip would be 'hard work': some understatement. It would be torture for a toddler to be confined for so long in such a space - and having walked up and down an aircraft aisle about 100 times on a two-hour flight with my son when he was 18 months, I could imagine her getting off the train in Beijing feeling like she'd walked all the way from Moscow!

  "<p>Through the imposing electronic gates, up the pristine gravel drive, past a small lake glittering in the midday sun and, finally, the big red brick house. A small dog appears from nowhere, yelping and wagging: Arthur. A man appears at the door. Tall, lean, bronzed. He wears pale blue crisp cotton shorts. He smiles, extends a hand: George. He opens the front door, lets the dog bounce in first.</p> <p>The hallway to this mansion on the outskirts of Windsor is bare, functional. Through a heavy wooden door a glimpse of a living room with Old Masters hung on the walls, two heavy sofas - covered in tapestry - endless china vases overflowing with huge exotic flowers. Another figure emerges at the far end of the living room. He walks slowly, with purpose. He is in no hurry perhaps he is tired. He wears a black tracksuit zipped right up, shiny black shoes with a wedge to give him height, both by Yohji Yamamoto, and small red sunglasses.</p> <p>Arthur is ecstatic. He jumps as high as he can to attract his master's attention his master absently pats his head and stands in the middle of the living room. An uncertain smile crosses his face. He extends a hand, gives a dry, firm handshake and flops on to a sofa, legs apart. He asks George to bring him a drink and offers water, every imaginable type of tea, coffee. His skin is pale. He takes off his sunglasses and rubs his bloodshot eyes. He pushes a hand through his reddish hair, makes it stick up a little.</p> <p>The talk is, initially, of football. Elton John is tired, he did a gig last night, but his energy rises as he chats about his interest in the game. His voice is surprisingly deep and sometimes he sounds American but rarely camp. He discusses his years as chairman of Watford FC from 1973 to 2002, when he used to travel to matches home and away. 'I never had any real aggro, just a lot of embarrassing chants.'</p> <p>He smiles, displaying the familiar gap between his teeth, and takes a Versace glass of Diet Coke and ice from a tray. 'Thanks. Nice shorts, George. Saucy. Anyway... You've just got to learn to take it: \"Don't sit round while Elton's around or you'll get a penis up your arse.\"'</p> <p>Elton John says that two things saved his life. Football and music. Music and football. He likes to see himself as a team player - he loved being chairman of the team he supported as a boy and hanging out with manager Graham Taylor and general manager Bertie Mee, and it gave him a reality check in his most decadent years.</p> <p>He sips his Coke. 'I'd turn up at the ground and be told, \"Cor, Elton, what a fucking awful suit that is!\" Or Graham Taylor would sit me down and say, \"You're drinking too much.\" I was doing drugs but I never took my habit to the football ground. Never. If I hadn't had Watford, I really don't know what would have happened to me...'</p> <p>While Watford provided a distraction at weekends, music was always there. When he was taking so many drugs that he can barely remember some of the gigs he performed or the albums he recorded - he reached a peak of taking cocaine on average every four minutes - Elton John never lost sight of his first love. 'At heart I've always been a music fan. That part of me has never changed since I was a little kid, sitting in a room watching a record go round, looking at the colour of the labels. It kept me going through the drugs the fact that I always wanted to hear what was going on.'</p> <p>He sighs. 'I didn't just isolate myself... well, towards the end, before I got clean in 1990, I isolated, but I was still working, still making music.' A wry smile. 'God knows what I was doing, but I was working.'</p> <p>Elton has never stopped working. At 57 he still tours the world and is still adding to his back catalogue. In 2001 he released Songs From the West Coast , his best studio album in years, and in November he brings out Peachtree Road , which is more impressive yet. It is also the first time he has produced his own work. He is at his best when he goes back to his bluesy, piano and vocals roots (the glad-to-be-alive 'The Weight of the World' and the soul-searching 'Answer in the Sky'), but he is also pretty good at country too ('They Call Her The Cat' 'Porch Swing in Tupelo'). That last track references Elvis - 'That truck drivin' boy, with the grease monkey look and the rock'n'roll voice' - who also seems to be the inspiration for the new look he sports when photographed by his friend Sam Taylor-Wood for this interview.</p> <p>Elton says the new album was 'really easy to produce', and he actually enjoyed being in the Peachtree Road studio in Atlanta rather than finding it a chore. 'As always I wrote the music pretty quickly the bulk of it was done within two weeks. I'm quite thrilled with the way it sounds.'</p> <p>While he had already sold 80 million records by the time he was 29 - including Tumbleweed Connection , Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player , the widely acclaimed Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and the epic Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy - Elton recently said he worries that he won't be remembered for his music. He is famous for his ostrich feather body suits, insect sunglasses, bespoke platform boots and hair weaves, for being a gay man who was once married, the original big spender (he readily admits to splashing out over pounds 1m a year on clothes). He has numerous houses in several countries and embraces a coterie of celebrity friends. He is responsible for the bestselling single ever - the re-recorded version of his 1974 hit 'Candle in the Wind' - but raises an eyebrow when asked if it became something of a career albatross.</p> <p>'In a way.' He sighs. 'Rightfully people say, \"Fucking 'Candle in the Wind'.\" Even I wouldn't sing it for two years. It was too painful.' He pauses then says, without prompting: 'I am a victim of my own excess, I admit that. It's been my own doing and I can't blame anyone else.'</p> <p>It is easy to wonder if Elton John wishes he were hip or cool, that his excesses weren't judged, that people remembered great songs such as 'Rocket Man', 'Daniel', 'Good bye Yellow Brick Road', 'Bennie and the Jets' or 'Tiny Dancer' rather than a slushy, sentimental paean to Princess Diana. 'Well, in the beginning I was cool. But I'm not interested in being cool now I just want to be me. The music has fluctuated: it's been great, it's been ordinary and sometimes it's been downright bad. That's going to happen over a 34-year career.'</p> <p>He ruffles the dog's head. 'I'm not everybody's cup of tea. But sometimes criticism can be hurtful. Be respectful I'm a good piano player, I can sing well, I write good songs. If you don't like it, fair enough. But give me a break. I know I'm dismissed sometimes as \"Elton the MOR rocker\" but it's hard to be anything else on piano. It's not an instrument you can throw into an amp or into the audience.'</p> <p>He points out - rightly - that there is too much snobbery in music. He says that if he were starting out now and in his twenties, he might be Chris Martin. 'I don't see the point in criticising Coldplay,' he says, pushing his hand through his hair. 'They are fucking great. They write really fabulous songs. Because they went to university they are somehow less credible? Hello?'</p> <p>He sits forward on the edge of the sofa. 'What a lot of bands don't realise these days is how important it is to have a work ethic. In the old days - the old days! - you had to tour forever in a Transit van and then maybe you'd get a record contract. Now bands get signed too quickly. Look at Oasis: instead of dedicating themselves to breaking America by touring, they spent all their time fighting and ligging. In the end they self-combusted. They became Spinal Tap. You've done 12 shows in the US? Fuck off! If you really want it you have to work hard. Which is exactly what Coldplay have done.'</p> <p>Elton John may worry about not being remembered for his music, but he doesn't know if he would like to be more influential he claims to have not really thought about it. But recently, more and more artists have cited his work, including the Scissor Sisters, Michael Stipe, Courtney Love and Mary J Blige (who borrowed the piano break from 'Bennie and the Jets' for her Grammy-winning 'Deep Inside'). He tips the last of the Coke back and lets his body sink into the sofa. 'It's not hip to say you're a big fan of Elton John , but a lot of people I respect like my work.' He smiles. 'I'm happy with that.'</p> <p>THE KEY TO ELTON JOHN 'S MUSIC IS, OF course, his relationship with Bernie Taupin. By 1963, when he was 16, Reginald Kenneth Dwight had left school and had begun his evolution into Elton Hercules John. By day the self-conscious, shy boy from Pinner, Middlesex worked as a messenger for a music publishing company by night he either performed with Bluesology, a semi-professional backing act for visiting soul musicians, or earned pounds 1 a night playing old piano favourites at a local hotel bar.</p> <p>In the late Sixties, he saw an advert in the NME placed by a record company looking for new talent. He ended up taking away some of Bernie Taupin's lyrics and by the time they met in person six months later, Elton had written the music to some 20 songs. They secured a three-year songwriting contract, with Taupin and John earning pounds 10 and pounds 15 a week respectively. It was an intense but strange period Elton recalls a particularly peculiar project where he had to try to make Nick Drake songs more commercial. 'An impossible task, really,' he says, smiling. 'I needed the money, so I did it.'</p> <p>John and Taupin were obsessed with music. 'We spent all our money on records. We used to go to Music Land in Berwick Street and listen to Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Dylan, the Beatles. Both of us with headphones on, lying on the floor looking at the gatefold sleeves. It's a lovely, sweet image...'</p> <p>During this period, Bernie lived with Elton at the family flat in Frome Court, Pinner. In the decades that have followed, the lyricist moved to America to live on a ranch ('he became the Brown Dirt Cowboy') and the two have mainly communicated by chatting on the phone every couple of weeks. It is astonishing that Bernie has continuously succeeded in writing lyrics which Elton sings as though they were his own. They have both worked with other people, but they're back as a songwriting duo on Peachtree Road</p> <p>Elton thinks that living apart has kept them close. 'We've always had a great love affair from a distance, and I think that's why we've stayed together. He knows who I am. We've always had that sixth sense. I don't know... when we were both writing with other people we weren't jealous, although we were probably hurt. But we had to do that for the relationship to survive.'</p> <p>He smiles. 'Bernie is one of the loves of my life. He's the best friend I never had at school. It was never a carnal relationship it was all about collecting records, going to gigs. We've never had a real fight. But I do remember him telling me so many times when I was doing drugs that I was an asshole...' He pauses for a moment. 'I can't explain how we work so well together. It just works. It's lucky. It's fate.'</p> <p>Elton knows he was not only lucky enough to meet Bernie early on in his career, but also that he was around at the best possible time. His contemporaries included Bowie, Jagger, Freddie Mercury and Rod Stewart. He could buy 10 albums a week that were brilliant (Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart, Hendrix, Laura Nyro, Buffalo Springfield: he mentions a dozen more in a single breath).</p> <p>He sits forward on the sofa and his eyes shine. 'I grew up out of that British variety, music hall, pantomime era we were all larger than life. The first one was Marc Bolan, who was a dear friend he was completely from another planet. I do like my rock stars to be a little larger than life. I don't mind the earnest ones at all, but I do like a bit of individuality.'</p> <p>Elton's saving grace has, perhaps, been his recent patronage of young artists. When he talks with such childlike enthusiasm about new bands, it is easy to forget 'I'm Still Standing' or 'Nikita'. He still buys dozens of records once a week, whether it's in King's Road, Chelsea or America or Japan.</p> <p>Of course he's smart enough to realise that it looks good for him to hang out with hip young artists, but when Elton John talks about music he seems entirely genuine. So he namechecks bands throughout the conversation: Nirvana's Nevermind is probably the best album of the Nineties (and he once shared a bill with the band but didn't have the courage to say hello to Kurt Cobain) Franz Ferdinand help to wake him up in the morning he's just discovered Jet ('a brilliant pastiche') he appreciates the fun the Darkness are having he loved the Scissor Sisters the minute he heard them.</p> <p>His two current favourites, however, are Rufus Wainwright and Ryan Adams. He eulogises about Rufus for a good 10 minutes while barely pausing for breath. 'He's astonishing. He gets up every day and writes I don't do that. I don't even play the piano unless I have to rehearse. Rufus plays it every day.'</p> <p>He feels protective towards Ryan. The young American's self-destructive streak reminds him of himself. He rings Ryan up from time to time to see how he is. He thinks it's good to offer support he remembers the Band coming to see him in Philadelphia when he was starting out and, as a fan, he was thrilled. But he also knows how hard it can be to ask for help.</p> <p>He fidgets on the sofa. 'It took me 16 years of stubbornness... and craziness... to ask for help. Because I thought it was a sign of weakness. I didn't get sober till 1990 because I struggled to ask for help. So if anybody picks up the phone and asks for a bit of my time, I'll be there for them.'</p> <p>PERHAPS BECAUSE HE'S BEEN THROUGH drug and alcohol addiction, because he outed himself before it was really acceptable or fashionable to be gay, because he's been through years and years of therapy, Elton John finds a lot of people come to him for advice. He grins. 'Let's phone up Uncle Elt!'</p> <p>He is proud of his new role as agony uncle to a new generation of artists. But it would be easy to think of him as envying young bands, as craving the thrill of the first taste of fame. Not so in fact, he can think of nothing worse. 'At the start of my career, I did everything, went everywhere, met everyone. I didn't mind having my photo taken. In fact, I enjoyed it.' He looks terribly serious for the first time. 'Now I'm 57 I loathe it. I find it very difficult to go out without attracting attention... so I'd rather stay home.'</p> <p>He scowls. 'There is no charisma any more. We know everything about everyone. If I see one more photo of Britney or J-Lo or Ben Affleck, I'm going to spit. I want mystery! That's why Morrissey has had some success again he's a bit of an enigma. I know I've cultivated this image of myself having tantrums and spending all this money and having nice weekends in my big house in the south of France... but I really don't think I court publicity like I used to. And I don't want it.'</p> <p>A clock chimes in the background. He glances at his simple but probably incredibly expensive black and white watch. Time is marching on. 'I'll leave all that celebrity stuff to the young guys.'</p> <p>Elton John has lived his life in two parts. The first he spent under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He talks of concerts barely remembered, of hopeless relationships, of spending his money badly ('I collected a lot of appalling art when I was on drugs your judgment is impaired when you're out of your mind'). He remembers one occasion, when he was staying at an American hotel and he'd been up all night, he rang his London management company and screamed: 'It's too fucking windy here - can you do something about it?'</p> <p>Which is not to say he didn't have a great time too, meeting his heroes. He met Brian Wilson when the Beach Boy had taken to playing his piano in a sandpit in the dining room and listened to 'Good Vibrations' until 4am ('I was simultaneously terrified and in awe of this brilliant man, who is probably the biggest influence on my songwriting') he got an autograph from Elvis, though he feels cheated as the king was bloated and 'too gone' he met an 'eccentric' Bob Dylan.</p> <p>In 1973, he spent a lot of time with John Lennon. 'I remember being in a room at the Sherry Netherlands hotel with John and we were both on coke. At 3am there was a knock on the door and we looked through the peephole it was Andy Warhol. We both stood there, paranoid, whispering: don't let him in!'</p> <p>On 29 July 1990, at the age of 43, Elton John got clean. After months in rehab and therapy, he stopped relying on the drugs and alcohol. By way of distraction, he started to collect photography. Not just the odd photo, naturally, but enough to fill a gallery. In the early Nineties he paid pounds 120,000 for Man Ray's Tears , then a world record for a photo. He bought an apartment in Atlanta - the only city in the world, he says, where he can live a relatively normal life - and filled it with pieces by contemporary photographers.</p> <p>He didn't lose his sense of fun - he tells some funny stories about his relationship with Rod Stewart, one that has endured since the early Seventies and that has been defined by practical jokes and wind-ups. 'I bought him a Zimmer frame for his 50th birthday and he sent me one of those old-fashioned ladies' hairdryers you sit underneath with the message: \"The only thing I forgot to buy was the hair to go with it.\" It's like a Joan Crawford/Bette Davis relationship. Rod's never lost his vicious British humour, and that's why I adore him.'</p> <p>On 30 October 1993, Elton John fell in love. He'd been on the road for a long time and wanted to meet new people he had a dinner party at Woodside, the house in Windsor, and David Furnish was one of the guests. Furnish had been a fan - Caribou was the first album he ever bought - and was shy but nonetheless gave Elton his number. 'I knew he was going off to a Halloween party and I always get up very early... I was trying to work out the earliest I could ring on a Sunday morning.'</p> <p>He laughs. 'At 11am I plucked up the courage to make the call. We had dinner in London that night and talked some more. David was the first person I'd been with who had his own apartment, his own job at Ogilvy and Mather, his own circle of friends. He also wasn't afraid to tell me what he thought.'</p> <p>Elton liked being told he was wrong. He liked being chastised for spending too much money it was refreshing for him after so many one-sided relationships in which he'd taken control.'I was so relieved that David was willing to challenge me when I lost it. He knew how to handle me and it wasn't with kid gloves.'</p> <p>There is a song for David on Peachtree Road . 'My Elusive Drug' is a touching, bluesy tribute to Elton's lover, written by Bernie Taupin but sung with aching tenderness. Once again, it seems as though Taupin has been telepathic. Elton laughs. 'I might be wrong because Bernie never tells me but that song screams of the fact that I've been through everything, I've tried everything and finally I've found my elusive drug - David. It's a very special song the Nina Simone song on the album.'</p> <p>Elton John grins. 'It's been 14 years since I got sober. I've got a new album, a great private life, and at 57 I feel excited by life.'</p> <p>As it's such a gorgeous afternoon, we take a walk around Elton's extensive gardens. The dog is over-excited, darting around the Italian garden Elton's late friend Gianni Versace encouraged him to create. He says the past 12 months have been the most creative of his life not just a new album, but Billy Elliot the Musical (he has written the music to the stage production of the Stephen Daldry film, which premieres this autumn in Newcastle), a Broadway production of The Vampire Lestat (based on the first two Anne Rice novels) and the soundtrack to an animated Disney film called Gnomeo and Juliet</p> <p>Then there are the concerts. Alongside his never-ending world tours, Elton is in residency in Las Vegas for the next three years, playing a total of 75 shows, in a lavish production designed by David LaChapelle. But he never forsakes the serious for the superficial his commitment as chairman of the Elton John Aids Foundation is as great as ever, while he also supports breast cancer charities. 'I go out and raise the money I am the whore,' he says. 'But I don't scream about it all the time.'</p> <p>Elton becomes serious for a moment as he contemplates his 60th birthday. 'There will come a time when my lifestyle has to change.. Why I'm still trying to prove something to myself, I don't know. I have a lovely private life with David but we don't spend enough time together.'</p> <p>He pauses, squinting. 'I'm not going to be like the Who and do a farewell tour for the next 15 years, but I am finding it harder, emotionally, to stay on the road.'</p> <p>He looks across the stunning gardens to the house he bought in 1975 in a drugs haze. 'This is home for me. It's where David and I first met. But we don't need the stuff I'd be happy living in a Winnebago with David because I love him so much.' His eyes are watering. Maybe it's the sun.</p> <p>'I always wanted to buy a big fucking retirement home and live in it with all my friends. An old department store in the King's Road would be perfect. I could run the CD shop, Neil Tennant the bookshop and Sam Taylor-Wood the art shop.' He rubs the dog's head. 'Either that or buy a big chateau in France and just walk around in kaftans eating donuts all day.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 3 2004</strong></p> <p> In the article below, we said that 'Tanni' is Welsh for 'tiny'. The University of Wales says the Welsh words for tiny are 'bychan', 'bach', 'bitw', 'man'. The UCW at Lampeter's online dictionary gives 'bitw'. </p> <p> </p> <p> Tanni Grey-Thompson is telling a story about a race a few years ago. 'It was the Portsmouth half-marathon, 1993. I was flying - it was one of the best days of my life. I was sitting in with a pack of guys, killing myself to get under 53 minutes, about to set a world best for a woman. About three-quarters of a mile from the finish, I could see a rival talking to some of the other men in the pack. </p> <p>'The next thing I knew, I was blocked on all sides and was driven into the kerb. He took off and they let him sprint clear for a hundred yards before they let me out. He beat me.' </p> <p>The 'he' in question was her then boyfriend, Ian Thompson. </p> <p>'I was absolutely furious with him. I took my helmet off and threw it at him, threw my gloves at him, tried to protest against him, everything. The official I was complaining to said, \"But he's your boyfriend.\" I said, \"So what?\" It was not a happy trip home and all he would say was: \"You shouldn't have let me do it.\" </p> <p>'When I calmed down, about three hours later, I realised he was right.' Ian is now her husband and her coach. </p> <p>Welcome to Tanni's world, where no concessions are given and none expected. She is a full-time professional athlete who trains twice a day, six days a week. She has nine Paralympic gold medals to her name, has won the London Marathon five times and broken more than 20 world records. She is also the mother of Carys, a two-and-a-half-year-old with strawberry-blonde hair and big blue eyes. </p> <p>Carys was Tanni's real name, too, before her sister dubbed her 'tanni', which means 'tiny' in Welsh. Tanni Grey was born in Cardiff and is fiercely proud of her Welsh roots, but is currently living near the north-east coast in Redcar. When I visit her there, toddler Carys is running around the house in a Tinkerbell T-shirt with a glint in her eye. </p> <p>'She sits on the stairs and says: \"You can't get me!\",' says her mother, 'and she will get under our dining-room table and just sit there. She knows that I have to get out of my chair to get her out, and then will have to use both my hands to get back in the chair so will let go of her. Whoosh, she's back under the table. So I just drag her out by the feet. </p> <p>'She can be difficult getting into the car as well because she knows I can't just pick her up and put her in. But all kids do that, she's no worse.' </p> <p>Carys is now in Athens, where her mother is competing in her fifth Paralympic Games as defending champion over 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m. But children are not allowed to stay in the Paralympic Village, and when I spoke to Tanni earlier this week, she hadn't seen her daughter for two weeks. </p> <p>'I've really missed her,' she says, 'though I like knowing that she'll be at the track for my races. There's a bit of me that would love her to watch me win a big race - but then I remember that she's only two-and-a-half and is more interested in finding someone to buy her an ice cream.' Tanni says she was just the same when she was a toddler, constantly running around and causing trouble. She was competitive in everything she did, trying tennis, swimming, basketball and archery before she settled on athletics. Tanni was born with spina bifida and curvature of the spine. The only question her mother asked the doctor at the time was: 'Will she be able to have children?' </p> <p>'I could walk until I was five or six,' Tanni explains. 'By the time I was seven, I was paralysed, so I can't really remember not being in a chair. But I was brought up to believe that I could achieve anything I wanted to as long as I studied hard and worked at things. </p> <p>'The first time I was treated as if I was different was in my teens, when I tried to go to the cinema with some friends and was told I couldn't go in because I was a fire risk. What kind of fire risk? Did they think I would spontaneously combust?' </p> <p>Tanni encounters ignorance and discrimination with a weary disdain, but is thankful that the UK is well ahead of other countries in its attitudes. Sport has played a huge part in changing perceptions, in focusing on the ability rather than the disability, in showing that a person who uses a wheelchair is not 'confined' to it. Nor do they 'suffer' from paralysis or spina bifida or cerebral palsy; these are conditions that people have, not conditions which define them. </p> <p>In her autobiography, Seize the Day, she wrote: 'I can't remember the day I got my first chair because it wasn't important. Some people may find that hard to understand, but the trouble is, there is this perception that walking is good and not walking is bad. For me, that's not true because being in a wheelchair has given me more mobility, not less. It's never stopped me from doing anything I wanted to do.' </p> <p>Her daughter so completely associates her mother with her chair that she used to get upset when Tanni sat on the floor. She would point at the chair, telling her mother to get back into it, as if she was worried what would happen if woman and machine were separated for too long. Tanni found out that she was pregnant while competing at the European Championships, when she was feeling sick even more than usual (she vomits before every major race through nerves). </p> <p>'The point at which we decided to try for a family,' she says, 'was a good time for me to have a break in my athletics career. When I came back and told Ian that I thought I was pregnant, and that the baby would be due in February, he said: \"Fantastic - you'll be back in time for the Commonwealth Games!\" And I think that's fine,' she smiles, 'that's an entirely normal reaction.' Tanni was back in training two-and-a-half weeks after giving birth by Caesarean section; competed in the London Marathon after eight weeks; and later that year broke the world record for 400m, one of the few races, she says, that produced in her a feeling of utter elation. </p> <p>More often than not, however, she spends the weeks before a big race suffering from a deep-rooted fear of failure - struggling to remember that her times prove she is good enough to beat her rivals; trying not to be sick in front of the television cameras and willing the whole experience away. After the race, she feels relief if she has won, is pleased if she has recorded a decent time but is furious if she has underperformed. </p> <p>'I don't like seeing pity in other people's faces,' she says. 'I don't want to be patted on the head and told I've done well if I know I haven't. I don't want people to tell me it doesn't matter if I've lost. If I've been beaten by a better athlete, so be it, but if I have got it wrong, it does matter. It matters to me.' </p> <p>This is where sport - and the Paralympic Games in particular - can change the way people without a physical impairment view those who have one. The original idea for the Games grew out of the rehabilitation programme at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire for Second World War veterans with spinal cord injuries. Sir Ludwig Guttmann, a neurosurgeon at Stoke Mandeville, organised the first competition for wheelchair athletes in 1948, to coincide with the London Olympics. By the time of the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Guttmann had pioneered a festival of paralympic sport with 400 competitors from 23 countries. </p> <p>The 2004 paralympic Games opened in Athens yesterday with 4,000 competitors from 146 different countries. Even in the time that Tanni has been competing, the Games have expanded by nearly 25 per cent, and she recognises that while elite sport is at the core of the Games, they represent more than competition. </p> <p>'The Paralympic Games are huge,' she says. 'It is about sport, about who is winning and who's not. But since Sydney I have had a much better understanding of what this is really all about. It's about changing people's ideas about disability, about showing what people can do.' </p> <p>Greece has not had the best record of integrating people with disabilities into society, preferring to shut them away in special homes. Consequently, Athenians have been rather surprised to find their city overrun by people on crutches, in wheelchairs and with prosthetic limbs. Just a few years ago, Tanni experienced the lack of awareness first-hand. </p> <p>'I was competing at the World Championships in 1997,' she says, 'and I was out in Athens when a little old lady dressed in black came up to me in the street and started poking me and pinching my cheeks. I've been stared at in the UK but nothing like that. </p> <p>'It's easy to forget that the UK and the States are so far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of accepting disabled people. Maybe what the Paralympics will do here is change people's attitudes. After all, the ethos of the Olympics and the Paralympics is about changing the way people think and moving things on. </p> <p>'If they're a success, it means that disabled people in Greece and other countries will be more accepted, will have rights to education, will have rights to work and will be part of society rather than shut away. If they can change attitudes in Greece, just imagine what they can do in Beijing in four years' time. If they can change attitudes in China, the whole world will change.' China has 200 athletes competing in Athens, compared with just 87 in Sydney. There is no doubt that the Chinese are building towards dominating the medals table, just as they have been moving up the rankings at the Olympics (three weeks ago, China finished higher than ever before, in second place behind the US), and it is a clear indication that China now takes the Paralympics as seriously as the Olympics. </p> <p>The chances are that, come Beijing, Tanni Grey-Thompson will be there as a coach or an administrator rather than a competitor. She is 35 now, and although she will continue to race, feels that there should be younger and better athletes coming through the system to take her place. </p> <p>'It almost feels as if part of my life is finishing, but there will be other options and other opportunities. I've always thought that it won't be down to me to decide when my athletics career is over - that it will be decided either by injury or by the selectors not picking me. I'll need to find something that gives me the same buzz as competing and it is fun coaching young athletes who improve in a really short space of time. </p> <p>'My athletics life has been very disciplined, some would say obsessive, but the rest of my life is chaos. We never have any milk in the house or bread and I'm always late doing things. One day we will have an immaculately tidy house, maybe when I finish racing.' </p> <p>Somehow I doubt that housework will feature very high on the list of Tanni's retirement plans, and before all that there is the small matter of four different distances to compete over between this weekend and next. </p> <p>There is huge pressure on Tanni in Athens because she is the most recognised wheelchair athlete in Britain. She spends a whole day giving interviews to the assembled press, talking for hours with the same enthusiasm for the last question as for the first. The perception is that she will win everything, something she reinforced in Sydney when she took home four gold medals. </p> <p>'I tend to compete well at major Games, which is good, but I don't win all the time. The one thing I know from experience is that the Paralympic Games bring out the best in me. I put huge pressure on myself because I want to win. Throughout my athletics career, winning gold has always been the most important thing. Silver and bronze just don't mean that much to me.' </p> <p>With stronger competition and a change in classification for the 200m, Tanni may have to settle for a medal she doesn't care for in at least one of her disciplines. She is more confident of success in the 100m, in which she has been recording lifetime-best times this year. She should go well in the 400m. But her first event, the 800m, is keeping her awake at night. It is probably no more than the old doubting demons coming back to haunt her, but she will be relieved to get today's semi-final and tomorrow's final out of the way. </p> <p>That's where husband Ian comes in, to give her a kick up the backside and tell her to get on with it. It's the only language she understands. </p>",
  "<p>It is not long after midnight, and Los Tigres del Norte are halfway through their set at Rodeo 2,000, a barn-like club near the town of Tyler, Texas. The audience is a sea of bobbing cowboy hats receding into the dark and through the open side doors, steam billows out into the humid summer night.</p> <p>On the dancefloor, stern-faced couples waltz awkwardly in their tight jeans and Texan heels, while stray children and cigarette-vendors push their way through the crush. Further forward, a group of schoolgirls raise their hands as if in prayer, while nearby, a shaven-headed youth in baggy jeans throws gang signs over the head of a middle-aged senora who is mouthing the words to every song.</p> <p>And up on stage, resplendent in silver Stetsons and zebra-striped rodeo suits, Los Tigres sing about the spectacular demise of Mexican drug smuggler Manuel Atillano.</p> <p>The song is called 'El Avion de la Muerte' (The Aeroplane of Death). Over a rollicking accordion line, it narrates how Atillano is captured by the Mexican army, and tortured until he agrees to fly them to the cartel's secret landing strip. Once in the air, he disarms one of the soldiers, seizes control of the plane and snarls that he'd rather die than squeal.</p> <p>With the soldiers weeping and pleading for their lives, he pushes the plane into a nose-dive, aiming for an army base below. But as they plummet earthwards, he sees a crowded school playground just next to the barracks. At the very last moment Atillano wrestles the plane off course, crashing into a hillside - saving the children, but killing both himself and his captors.</p> <p>It's a magnificent, ridiculous song, equal parts grotesquery, sentiment and melodrama. It's also completely true: air traffic controllers recorded the whole sorry incident. This is narcocorrido , a music steeped in the blood and gun-smoke of Mexico's drug wars. Largely invisible to the English-speaking world, it is wildly popular throughout Latin America and among the Chicano population of the USA.</p> <p>To the backing of an accordion, a 12-stringed bajo sexto guitar - and occasionally a full brass band - the songs recount the exploits of daring, brutal drug lords who outwit corrupt policemen and hypocritical gringos. Narcocorrido takes its form from the polkas and waltzes of northern Mexico, and its lyrics blend a documentary eye for detail with a mythologising flair for an outrageously tall tale.</p> <p>For centuries the corrido , or ballad, formed a repository of popular Mexican history, preserving the memory of the most daring bandits, the fastest racehorses, and the cruellest generals.</p> <p>Its golden age came during the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1917, when corridistas churned out thousands of songs: musical dispatches through which the largely illiterate population could follow the progress of the war.</p> <p>By the Fifties, musicologists believed it was a dying form, but in the Seventies, the corrido was reborn, with shoot-outs and drug-runners replacing bandoleros and revolution. Nowadays, a narcocorrido set-list reads like a potted history of the Mexican drug industry: there are songs about every major trafficker of the past 30 years, and if they are occasionally a touch formulaic, it's only because they tend to culminate in the violent death of the protagonist.</p> <p>Inevitably, they are not to everyone's taste: educated Mexicans are scandalised by what they see as the debasement of a noble folk tradition, the Catholic Church has denounced corridistas for glorifying the drugs trade, and at least five Mexican states have banned radios from airing the music. But like gangsta rap, narcocorrido has thrived on the controversy - despite the ban, it has massive support from its fans.</p> <p>TONIGHT, AT LEAST 4,000 PEOPLE HAVE crammed into the Rodeo 2000 to see Los Tigres, and - apart from me and Luca the photographer - there is not an Anglo in the house. Most of the fans are Mexican and Central American, and many of them are illegal immigrants employed on the vast flower farms nearby. As a hail of pre-recorded gunfire signals a new song, a drunk with a drooping moustache asks me if I work for la migra . When I assure him that I am nothing to do with the immigration service, he bear hugs me, and gestures proudly at the band. 'This is music for the people,' he bellows. ' Musica para la raza .'</p> <p>It seems a strange comment to make: the song, 'Jefe de Jefes' (The Boss of Bosses), is written in the voice of a shadowy drug kingpin - hardly a representative of ordinary working folk. But as I watch the exhausted flower-pickers sing along with every word, it becomes clear that this is exactly why they are entranced by the figure of the swaggering antihero.</p> <p>'I am the boss of bosses,' they sing. 'Respected at all levels/Many want to climb as high, but see how they fall/They want to steal my crown, but those who tried have all died.'</p> <p>The next morning I meet Jorge Hernandez, the band's lead singer and accordionist, who formed the band in 1968 with two younger brothers, a cousin and a friend. They grew up in a remote Mexican hill village, and although they have lived in California for many years, they have never forgotten the world they left behind.</p> <p>In much of rural Mexico, farmers see marijuana and opium poppy as their only way of escaping poverty, and in regions where the government has failed to provide even the most basic services, drug dealers have become heroes for creating jobs and building schools, churches and roads.</p> <p>'Poor people idolise the narcos: they admire their bravery, and they want to be like them. When you sing the songs, the audience feel that they're living through the characters, as if they were watching a film. That's why people love the corrido. It lets them dream,' Hernandez says.</p> <p>Many of Los Tigres's songs are inspired by events in newspaper reports, or stories passed on by fans. But Hernandez says that even the corridos featuring fictional characters reflect the realities of Mexican life.</p> <p>In a country where politicians are routinely exposed as corrupt, newspapers are bribed or threatened into silence, and the police are widely believed to commit more crimes than they solve, people look to the corrido for the truth, he says. 'People believe a corrido much more than anything the authorities tell them.'</p> <p>This is why the drug ballad has thrived, says Manuel Valenzuela, a sociologist and author of a book on Mexico's drug culture. 'The corrido has always been a way for the underdogs to express their opinion - which is often very different from the official government version of history.'</p> <p>Narcocorridos can be seen as an attempt to make some kind of sense of the spread of drug-fuelled violence and corruption. 'Drug trafficking permeates our whole society: politics, the military, the church and big business have all been corrupted,' says Valenzuela.</p> <p>By bribe or bullet, the drug trade has imposed its own morality on wider society: one recent opinion poll showed that most young Mexicans believe that there is no qualitative difference between a trafficker and a policeman. 'We don't know who are the good guys and who are the bad guys,' sighs Valenzuela.</p> <p>As you fly west over Texas, the lush pastureland and whitewashed farms gradually give way to scrubby hills dotted with trailer-homes - and then eventually to the desert, inhabited solely by clusters of oil wells.</p> <p>From here to California the frontier is little more than an idea - an invisible line along 2,000 miles of sand and mountain.</p> <p>Undeclared goods have been traded across the border since it was first delineated in 1848, but large-scale smuggling did not begin until 1920, when Prohibition created a new market for bootleg tequila.</p> <p>With the end of Prohibition in 1933, the smugglers turned to other goods: morphine, heroin and marijuana. One year later, the first known narcocorrido was published. 'El Contrabandista', or The Smuggler, tells the story of a Mexican smuggler who is captured by Texas Rangers after diversifying from tequila to 'cocaine, morphine and marijuana'.</p> <p>Since then, the drug-running has never stopped. In the Sixties, traffickers shipped their loads in light aircraft by the Eighties they were sending fleets of converted 747s. Nowadays, they simply drive across the desert in air-conditioned SUVs.</p> <p>Jose Angel Lopez admits that he was not a very successful smuggler: on his first run to the border, he was arrested with a truckload of marijuana, and he is now three years into an eight-year prison sentence in Ciudad Juarez - a sprawling, violent city just across the border from El Paso, Texas. Juarez jail is a massive complex on the outskirts of town. Black-clad guards with assault rifles patrol its 40-foot walls, and all around bales of razor-wire glitter in the harsh desert sun. Despite the jail's grim exterior, the regime is fairly liberal and inmates earn extra cash by selling food, handicrafts - and drug ballads.</p> <p>Jose Angel is the lead singer of corrido quartet Los Compas del Norte (The Mates of the North), whose members are all doing time on drugs charges. Immaculately dressed in pressed jeans and crocodile skin cowboy boots, they stroll the yard playing requests to their fellow inmates, charging a pound for every song.</p> <p>Classic narcocorridos with names like 'Contrabando y Traicion' (Contraband and Treachery) and 'La Pista Secreta' (The Secret Landing Strip) - are the most popular, although Jose Angel claims that prison has soured his taste for dope songs. 'When I used to listen to corridos I thought the narcos were so cool and daring. Now I'm inside I can see the other side of the coin,' he says, although his tone of contrition may have something to do with the guards who hover just within earshot as we speak.</p> <p>Angel also writes on commission for other prisoners, charging pounds 50 per song. 'I write about love, women, friendship,' he says. This may well be true, but his patrons seem more interested in songs about the very misdeeds which landed them in jail.</p> <p>The lyrics of Angel's prison-recorded CD The Forgotten Prisoner revolve around wild shoot-outs, fragrant marijuana buds and midnight border runs. 'People like to hear songs about themselves,' shrugs Jose. 'You have to exaggerate a little sometimes, but it's all basically true.'</p> <p>NO EXAGGERATION IS NECESSARY IN telling the story of Angel's idol, Rosalino 'Chalino' Sanchez, a singer who also began his career in jail, but went on to become the first and greatest star of narcocorrido.</p> <p>Sanchez was born in the badlands of Sinaloa, a state in north west Mexico known best for the quality of its marijuana and the fiery temperament of its inhabitants.</p> <p>When he was 15, Sanchez shot and killed a man who had raped his sister, and fled to California, where for a while he worked as a 'coyote', smuggling illegal immigrants and drugs across the border. Only when he was arrested, and spent nearly a year in Tijuana prison, did he discover his skill at songwriting. Like Angel, he began composing corridos for fellow inmates, and once outside, found his skills in demand from both dealers and legitimate immigrants.</p> <p>With his throaty and tuneless voice, Sanchez was never a great singer his real talent was as a lyricist. At the time, corridistas told their stories in the playful tone of a comic book or action movie, but he revelled in the savage reality of the underworld, peppering his songs with gory details of torture and execution.</p> <p>Everything about 'Chalino' Sanchez signalled his distance from the crooning loverboys of mainstream Mexican pop: plainly dressed in cotton shirts and jeans, his one accessory was the handgun always tucked in his belt. He was the archetypal Mexican valiente - a hard man. During a concert in early 1992, Chalino was shot in the side by a member of the audience. Wounded, the singer drew his revolver and returned fire, and in the ensuing gun battle seven people were injured, and at least one was killed.</p> <p>The shooting reinforced his reputation, sending his record sales through the roof - but it was also a sign that the line between his art and his life was now dangerously blurred.</p> <p>That May, as Sanchez left a concert in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, he was forced into a car by a group of men with police IDs. At dawn the next day, his body was found lying near a canal. He had been shot twice in the back of the head.</p> <p>Nobody was ever arrested for the murder, but death turned 'Chalino' Sanchez into a Mexican version of Tupac Shakur. He became a legend, producing more posthumous records than he did in life, and spawning an army of imitators, all of them singing in his trademark guttural style.</p> <p>'Chalino revolutionised the corrido, in the way he sang and the subjects he sang about. He invented the corrido bravo - the thug corrido,' says Jose Manuel Camargo, who, performing as El As de la Sierra (The Ace of the Sierra), is one of the many singers inspired by Chalino. I meet the Ace several days after leaving Juarez. From the border, the road winds south, through the Chihuahua and Durango deserts, then up into the pine-clad mountains of Sinaloa. The Sierra Madre Occidental is the heartland of Mexico's drug-trade: its cloud-swathed peaks and deep shaded valleys hide hundreds of marijuana plantations, opium fields and secret landing strips.</p> <p>This is where the Ace grew up in a peasant family, who lived off their marijuana patch. Now he lives in Los Mochis, a dusty town near the Pacific coast, and it soon becomes clear that his circumstances have changed dramatically.</p> <p>At the bus station in Mochis, Luca and I are greeted by two thickset men who identify themselves as the Ace's bodyguards. They hustle us into the cab of a pick-up truck with tinted windows, and as we drive through the city, the driver mutters cryptically into a walkie-talkie. After a dozen or so blocks, we rendezvous with three more trucks, and barrel out of town in a high-speed convoy, heading for the Ace's country retreat.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, we turn off the main highway and bounce down a dusty track, pulling to a halt in a dusty barbed wire compound. Half a dozen bodyguards fan out from the trucks, and when they are in position, the Ace slowly climbs down from the driving seat of his gleaming landcruiser.</p> <p>Under a bespoke Stetson, Jose Manuel cuts a slight figure, stooping under a mass of golden jewellery hanging from his neck and arms. His shirt and jeans are Versace, his belt and boots ostrich skin and tucked in his waistband is an automatic pistol.</p> <p>The Ace offers us a cool glass of water, then shows us round the ranchito: the collection of wild deer and peacocks, the plain one-storey farmhouse - and near the fence of thorny cacti, a stray marijuana plant. Sniffing the buds, he nods approvingly. 'Nearly ripe,' he says. 'Everyone in the Sierra grows marijuana - up there, you can't make a living from anything else.'</p> <p>His cousins still grow dope, but Jose says that he no longer needs to - his relationship with the drug industry is much more profitable. Like his namesake in Juarez jail, he composes songs to order - but the Ace's clients include some of the most feared and powerful gangsters in Mexico.</p> <p>'I have a lot of fans who are... well, I call them business people. Mafia people, if you like,' he says. 'It's nice to sing about them.'</p> <p>It's lucrative work: the Ace can charge up to $30,000 for a brand-new corrido - although he will sometimes waive the fee for a friend. 'It's my job. If somebody pays me to do a corrido, I'll do it. If they're a Mafioso or not, it's all the same to me,' he says.</p> <p>One of the Ace's best known songs was written about Hector 'Whitey' Palma, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, arrested in 1995 after a plane crash. Palma was imprisoned for ordering the murder of a state attorney general, but according to the Ace's corrido: 'His rivals in jail and outside are trembling/ They know what he is capable of/ When it's time to pay, they'll pay with their skins.'</p> <p>On his latest CD, the Ace included an account of the capture this January of Palma's lieutenant and hit man, Javier Torres Felix. 'We had friends in common,' he shrugs. 'He was caught, and three days later I'd written the corrido.'</p> <p>One of the minders gives a warning shout, and moments later, a police cruiser slows to a halt at the compound gate. The Ace raises a hand to the officer at the wheel, who stares briefly, nods, and the car rolls on. 'I pay those guys a special tax every month,' he says. 'Just so there aren't any problems.'</p> <p>Not all problems can be so easily avoided: the Ace's relationship with the Sinaloa drug lords has earned him the enmity of rival Mafia groups - hence the bodyguards - and several Mexican cities have been removed from his tour schedules. He is not the first corrido singer to have cosied up to the cartels. In 1997 a police informer told his handlers that Los Tucanes de Tijuana, the Toucans of Tijuana, were sponsored by Ramon Arellano-Felix, who with his brother Benjamin headed the Tijuana drug cartel.</p> <p>In a transcript of his statement which was leaked to a Mexican magazine, the informer said that Los Tucanes had written songs about specific murders carried out by the brothers. 'If you listen carefully, the songs tell how the Arellanos killed these people. I don't know how he gets his information.'</p> <p>According to the informer, the cartel used the group's music to lay out a code of conduct for its members: 'Through the corridos comes the philosophy, how the mem bers of the cartel have to behave. They tell you what they did wrong. Why they were killed. You learn what you have to do so they won't kill you.'</p> <p>Following the arrests of a number of high-profile bosses, this year has seen a surge in drug-related violence. According to Mexican newspapers, the killers often taunt the authorities by jamming police radio frequencies with narcocorridos.</p> <p>On the day I reach Culiacan, a young police commander is shot dead on the city's main shopping street - a typical Mafia hit, says veteran local journalist Gilberto Castro. It's a high-profile murder, but not a rarity: the city has a population of just 600,000, but sees an average of two killings every day. 'People kill just to have a song written about them. Or they get themselves killed and end up in a song,' says Castro. 'In the underworld you gain immortality through the words of a corrido - and if you aren't bad, nobody will write about you.'</p> <p>He takes me to the shrine of Jesus Malverde - a mythical Robin Hood-style bandit who has become a local folk hero and the patron saint of drug traffickers. Inside the chapel, a bust of Malverde stands next to the Virgin Mary. With his solemn gaze and luxuriant black moustache, he has the air of a matinee idol.</p> <p>Every year, drug smugglers come here and pray to Malverde for a bountiful harvest, protection from their enemies, and good luck at the frontier. Around the altar, worshippers light votive candles, or leave offerings - dollar bills, toy trucks, tapes of narcocorridos. 'Thank you Malverde for protecting me from enemies and watching over the road I travel. From Culiacan to Chicago,' reads one plaque on the chapel wall. On another, a worshipper thanks Malverde for getting him out of prison.</p> <p>A trio of musicians - accordion, bajo sexto and double bass - drift in and launch into one of the many corridos written about the narco-saint - another offering from a grateful supplicant. When they finish, I ask the bass player if he knows who ordered the song, but he shrugs off the question, and they strike up another tune. It's an old number by los Tigres called 'Pacas de a kilo' (One-kilo Packets): 'I take off my planes in two or three hundred metres, I handle machine guns of various calibres/People are saying that one day I'll be killed/But grudges don't scare me - I know how to win and I know how to lose.'</p> <p>There are bands like this all over town. Freelance musicians at the lowest end of the corrido hierarchy, they wait on street corners or stroll through the flyblown cantinas, where for a pound a shot, they can offer you three minutes of glory.</p> <p>ON MY LAST DAY IN CULIACAN, I WANDER into a nameless cantina near the market and order a beer. It is only 3pm but there are already a handful of drunks propped against the bar. In the stained wood of my table, somebody has scratched the word 'perico' - cocaine - and the outline of a dagger. At the next table, there are two musicians - an accordionist named Margarito Florez, and his brother, Inez, who idly strums a guitar as we talk.</p> <p>'There are so many stories in Mexico. The words of the corrido come straight from the pages of the newspaper - you just have to add music and, there, you have a new song,' he says.</p> <p>'It's all true,' agrees Margarito. 'Take this police commander who was shot the other day. Four killers, and the policeman shooting back. It's already a corrido.'</p> <p>Inez agrees enthusiastically, but points out that there were in fact five killers, or maybe six. Since the day of the shooting, I have been told the story several dozen times, and it seems that with each retelling the details are subtly different: they grow a little more dramatic perhaps, or a touch more tragic. As Margarito and Inez argue over what really happened that day in Culiacan, it seems that they are no longer describing yet another sordid killing in the endless war on drugs. Over the chords of Inez's guitar, the murder is already slipping from the world of cold fact into the mythical reality of narcocorrido.</p>",
  "<p>Not owning a TV myself, I haven't actually seen any of those 'builder from hell' programmes which the medium delights in. I always know when they've been on, though. I have worked as a self-employed electrician for more than 20 years, and I've lost count of the times when, on arriving at a client's house, I've had a rerun of the previous night's horror stories. </p> <p>Of course, a TV series on polite, responsible and honest builders would not provide the required level of drama. They do exist, however, and based on my own experience, I'd like to offer a brief guide to handling the client-builder relationship. </p> <p>I'm primarily speaking to those unfortunates who are about to 'call the man in', but if any of my fellow tradesmen see it I hope it may enlighten them too. I use the masculine pronoun deliberately, as I am not in a position to speak for the many tradeswomen out there. </p> <p>To begin with, I ask only two things of the people I work for: that they give me clear instructions, and pay their bills on time. For a client, any attempt to ice this simple cake will be met with covert derision and cynicism. </p> <p>For example, I often hear at the start of a job: 'Oh you must come to dinner when the work is finished!' I can no longer bring myself to smile ingratiatingly at this, and simply reply with the truth, which is, that by the halfway point of the job or earlier, you will never want to see me again, ever. Nothing personal, it's just that weeks of dust, noise and the sheer invasion of personal space would try anyone's goodwill. </p> <p>Another way to raise a cloud of scepticism is to say: 'I'll tell all my friends about you, they need lots of work doing.' This is invariably said before the work starts, with the hope that you will work especially hard and cheaply in expectation of recommendations. All builders know, however, that having heard this, they will never again hear from the client or anyone known to him, no matter how well the job has gone. </p> <p>Once the work has begun, don't confuse the issue by making whimsical changes which disrupt the flow, and don't expect the builder to make design decisions for you unless you are paying him a designer's fee. In my field, I will do anything you want as long as it doesn't conflict with the wiring regulations, but I can't get too emotionally involved over your choice of ceiling light. </p> <p>If you are a couple, try not to disagree too violently with each other when settling the details of the work, as builders are not generally trained as counsellors, and find it difficult to pretend agreement with two points of view at the same time, especially when they think both are daft anyway. In this situation I calm myself by means of the following mantra: 'The customer is right, even when they're wrong...' </p> <p>When the work has started, turn the central heating off. What is comfortable for you sitting at the word processor is unbearable for anyone doing strenuous physical work. The job will go faster and tempers will remain steady if the temperature is kept low - you can always plug in a heater for the room you are using. </p> <p>Best of all is for you to go out and come back about five minutes before the day's work ends, provided you don't then insist on a lengthy progress report when your man wants to go home. Save it for the morning, which will give you a chance to examine the day's work in private. If you don't trust the builder to be left alone, you have hired the wrong one. </p> <p>So, how to find the right builder? Personal recom mendations are not necessarily the best way. I have seen many cases where someone who has made a good job of, say, fitting some shelves, has been employed to put up a two-storey extension and has proved completely unfit for a job of that size. Try to determine the extent of his experience and look at some of his previous jobs if possible. </p> <p>Take a look at his van - if the wing mirror is held on by sticky tape, it doesn't mean that he is so good he is too busy to fix it. It just means that he is sloppy. It is also a bad sign if he can start work straight away - good tradesmen are always busy and you should expect to wait for at least a week or two. </p> <p>If he is claiming any trade qualifications, such as enrolment with Corgi or the NICEIC (for plumbers and electricians respectively), phone those organisations and check. Many of those claims are fraudulent, so if you find a tradesman who is cheating, report him to the relevant organisation. Don't be too embarrassed to ask for evidence of valid public liability insurance - if none is forthcoming, go elsewhere. </p> <p>Never, never, never allow a job to start without getting something in writing. Depending on the size of the job, it doesn't have to be a full contract, but at least get a detailed written specification with terms of payment, and make sure your builder signs it. Even with goodwill on both sides, the possibilities for misunderstanding in verbal agreements are immense. </p> <p>Make all payments by cheque, insist on invoices, and don't offer to pay cash, hoping for a discount. You are employing a professional, so treat him with at least as much respect as you would offer to your doctor or solicitor. </p> <p>Finally, if you think you are being clever by getting three quotations, bear in mind that not all builders work to the same standards, and it may be a false economy to go for the cheapest. It also takes time and therefore money to price jobs which end up going to the competition, so don't be surprised if you are asked to pay a fee for an estimate (usually refundable on acceptance). You will probably get a great deal of useful advice and information from anyone coming to look at the work, so don't begrudge paying for it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:jones@elecserve.freeserve.co.uk\">jones@elecserve.freeserve.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Through the imposing electronic gates, up the pristine gravel drive, past a small lake glittering in the midday sun and, finally, the big red brick house. A small dog appears from nowhere, yelping and wagging: Arthur. A man appears at the door. Tall, lean, bronzed. He wears pale blue crisp cotton shorts. He smiles, extends a hand: George. He opens the front door, lets the dog bounce in first. </p> <p>The hallway to this mansion on the outskirts of Windsor is bare, functional. Through a heavy wooden door a glimpse of a living room with Old Masters hung on the walls, two heavy sofas - covered in tapestry - endless china vases overflowing with huge exotic flowers. Another figure emerges at the far end of the living room. He walks slowly, with purpose. He is in no hurry; perhaps he is tired. He wears a black tracksuit zipped right up, shiny black shoes with a wedge to give him height, both by Yohji Yamamoto, and small red sunglasses. </p> <p>Arthur is ecstatic. He jumps as high as he can to attract his master's attention; his master absently pats his head and stands in the middle of the living room. An uncertain smile crosses his face. He extends a hand, gives a dry, firm handshake and flops on to a sofa, legs apart. He asks George to bring him a drink and offers water, every imaginable type of tea, coffee. His skin is pale. He takes off his sunglasses and rubs his bloodshot eyes. He pushes a hand through his reddish hair, makes it stick up a little. </p> <p>The talk is, initially, of football. Elton John is tired, he did a gig last night, but his energy rises as he chats about his interest in the game. His voice is surprisingly deep and sometimes he sounds American but rarely camp. He discusses his years as chairman of Watford FC from 1973 to 2002, when he used to travel to matches home and away. 'I never had any real aggro, just a lot of embarrassing chants.'</p> <p>He smiles, displaying the familiar gap between his teeth, and takes a Versace glass of Diet Coke and ice from a tray. 'Thanks. Nice shorts, George. Saucy. Anyway ... You've just got to learn to take it: \"Don't sit round while Elton's around or you'll get a penis up your arse.\"' </p> <p>Elton John says that two things saved his life. Football and music. Music and football. He likes to see himself as a team player - he loved being chairman of the team he supported as a boy and hanging out with manager Graham Taylor and general manager Bertie Mee, and it gave him a reality check in his most decadent years. </p> <p>He sips his Coke. 'I'd turn up at the ground and be told, \"Cor, Elton, what a fucking awful suit that is!\" Or Graham Taylor would sit me down and say, \"You're drinking too much.\" I was doing drugs but I never took my habit to the football ground. Never. If I hadn't had Watford, I really don't know what would have happened to me ...' </p> <p>While Watford provided a distraction at weekends, music was always there. When he was taking so many drugs that he can barely remember some of the gigs he performed or the albums he recorded - he reached a peak of taking cocaine on average every four minutes - Elton John never lost sight of his first love. 'At heart I've always been a music fan. That part of me has never changed since I was a little kid, sitting in a room watching a record go round, looking at the colour of the labels. It kept me going through the drugs; the fact that I always wanted to hear what was going on.' </p> <p>He sighs. 'I didn't just isolate myself ... well, towards the end, before I got clean in 1990, I isolated, but I was still working, still making music.' A wry smile. 'God knows what I was doing, but I was working.' </p> <p>Elton has never stopped working. At 57 he still tours the world and is still adding to his back catalogue. In 2001 he released Songs From the West Coast, his best studio album in years, and in November he brings out Peachtree Road, which is more impressive yet. It is also the first time he has produced his own work. He is at his best when he goes back to his bluesy, piano and vocals roots (the glad-to-be-alive 'The Weight of the World' and the soul-searching 'Answer in the Sky'), but he is also pretty good at country too ('They Call Her The Cat'; 'Porch Swing in Tupelo'). That last track references Elvis - 'That truck drivin' boy, with the grease monkey look and the rock'n'roll voice' - who also seems to be the inspiration for the new look he sports when photographed by his friend Sam Taylor-Wood for this interview. </p> <p>Elton says the new album was 'really easy to produce', and he actually enjoyed being in the Peachtree Road studio in Atlanta rather than finding it a chore. 'As always I wrote the music pretty quickly; the bulk of it was done within two weeks. I'm quite thrilled with the way it sounds.' </p> <p>While he had already sold 80 million records by the time he was 29 - including Tumbleweed Connection, Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player, the widely acclaimed Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and the epic Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy - Elton recently said he worries that he won't be remembered for his music. He is famous for his ostrich feather body suits, insect sunglasses, bespoke platform boots and hair weaves, for being a gay man who was once married, the original big spender (he readily admits to splashing out over \u00a31m a year on clothes). He has numerous houses in several countries and embraces a coterie of celebrity friends. He is responsible for the bestselling single ever - the re-recorded version of his 1974 hit 'Candle in the Wind' - but raises an eyebrow when asked if it became something of a career albatross.</p> <p>'In a way.' He sighs. 'Rightfully people say, \"Fucking 'Candle in the Wind'.\" Even I wouldn't sing it for two years. It was too painful.' He pauses then says, without prompting: 'I am a victim of my own excess, I admit that. It's been my own doing and I can't blame anyone else.' </p> <p>It is easy to wonder if Elton John wishes he were hip or cool, that his excesses weren't judged, that people remembered great songs such as 'Rocket Man', 'Daniel', 'Good bye Yellow Brick Road', 'Bennie and the Jets' or 'Tiny Dancer' rather than a slushy, sentimental paean to Princess Diana. 'Well, in the beginning I was cool. But I'm not interested in being cool now; I just want to be me. The music has fluctuated: it's been great, it's been ordinary and sometimes it's been downright bad. That's going to happen over a 34-year career.'</p> <p>He ruffles the dog's head. 'I'm not everybody's cup of tea. But sometimes criticism can be hurtful. Be respectful; I'm a good piano player, I can sing well, I write good songs. If you don't like it, fair enough. But give me a break. I know I'm dismissed sometimes as \"Elton the MOR rocker\" but it's hard to be anything else on piano. It's not an instrument you can throw into an amp or into the audience.'</p> <p>He points out - rightly - that there is too much snobbery in music. He says that if he were starting out now and in his twenties, he might be Chris Martin. 'I don't see the point in criticising Coldplay,' he says, pushing his hand through his hair. 'They are fucking great. They write really fabulous songs. Because they went to university they are somehow less credible? Hello?' </p> <p>He sits forward on the edge of the sofa. 'What a lot of bands don't realise these days is how important it is to have a work ethic. In the old days - the old days! - you had to tour forever in a Transit van and then maybe you'd get a record contract. Now bands get signed too quickly. Look at Oasis: instead of dedicating themselves to breaking America by touring, they spent all their time fighting and ligging. In the end they self-combusted. They became Spinal Tap. You've done 12 shows in the US? Fuck off! If you really want it you have to work hard. Which is exactly what Coldplay have done.' </p> <p>Elton John may worry about not being remembered for his music, but he doesn't know if he would like to be more influential; he claims to have not really thought about it. But recently, more and more artists have cited his work, including the Scissor Sisters, Michael Stipe, Courtney Love and Mary J Blige (who borrowed the piano break from 'Bennie and the Jets' for her Grammy-winning 'Deep Inside'). He tips the last of the Coke back and lets his body sink into the sofa. 'It's not hip to say you're a big fan of Elton John, but a lot of people I respect like my work.' He smiles. 'I'm happy with that.' </p> <p>The key to Elton John's music is, of course, his relationship with Bernie Taupin. By 1963, when he was 16, Reginald Kenneth Dwight had left school and had begun his evolution into Elton Hercules John. By day the self-conscious, shy boy from Pinner, Middlesex worked as a messenger for a music publishing company; by night he either performed with Bluesology, a semi-professional backing act for visiting soul musicians, or earned \u00a31 a night playing old piano favourites at a local hotel bar. </p> <p>In the late Sixties, he saw an advert in the NME placed by a record company looking for new talent. He ended up taking away some of Bernie Taupin's lyrics and by the time they met in person six months later, Elton had written the music to some 20 songs. They secured a three-year songwriting contract, with Taupin and John earning \u00a310 and \u00a315 a week respectively. It was an intense but strange period; Elton recalls a particularly peculiar project where he had to try to make Nick Drake songs more commercial. 'An impossible task, really,' he says, smiling. 'I needed the money, so I did it.' </p> <p>John and Taupin were obsessed with music. 'We spent all our money on records. We used to go to Music Land in Berwick Street and listen to Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Dylan, the Beatles. Both of us with headphones on, lying on the floor looking at the gatefold sleeves. It's a lovely, sweet image ...' </p> <p>During this period, Bernie lived with Elton at the family flat in Frome Court, Pinner. In the decades that have followed, the lyricist moved to America to live on a ranch ('he became the Brown Dirt Cowboy') and the two have mainly communicated by chatting on the phone every couple of weeks. It is astonishing that Bernie has continuously succeeded in writing lyrics which Elton sings as though they were his own. They have both worked with other people, but they're back as a songwriting duo on Peachtree Road. </p> <p>Elton thinks that living apart has kept them close. 'We've always had a great love affair from a distance, and I think that's why we've stayed together. He knows who I am. We've always had that sixth sense. I don't know ... when we were both writing with other people we weren't jealous, although we were probably hurt. But we had to do that for the relationship to survive.' </p> <p>He smiles. 'Bernie is one of the loves of my life. He's the best friend I never had at school. It was never a carnal relationship; it was all about collecting records, going to gigs. We've never had a real fight. But I do remember him telling me so many times when I was doing drugs that I was an asshole ...' He pauses for a moment. 'I can't explain how we work so well together. It just works. It's lucky. It's fate.' </p> <p>Elton knows he was not only lucky enough to meet Bernie early on in his career, but also that he was around at the best possible time. His contemporaries included Bowie, Jagger, Freddie Mercury and Rod Stewart. He could buy 10 albums a week that were brilliant (Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart, Hendrix, Laura Nyro, Buffalo Springfield: he mentions a dozen more in a single breath). </p> <p>He sits forward on the sofa and his eyes shine. 'I grew up out of that British variety, music hall, pantomime era; we were all larger than life. The first one was Marc Bolan, who was a dear friend; he was completely from another planet. I do like my rock stars to be a little larger than life. I don't mind the earnest ones at all, but I do like a bit of individuality.' </p> <p>Elton's saving grace has, perhaps, been his recent patronage of young artists. When he talks with such childlike enthusiasm about new bands, it is easy to forget 'I'm Still Standing' or 'Nikita'. He still buys dozens of records once a week, whether it's in King's Road, Chelsea or America or Japan. </p> <p>Of course he's smart enough to realise that it looks good for him to hang out with hip young artists, but when Elton John talks about music he seems entirely genuine. So he namechecks bands throughout the conversation: Nirvana's Nevermind is probably the best album of the Nineties (and he once shared a bill with the band but didn't have the courage to say hello to Kurt Cobain); Franz Ferdinand help to wake him up in the morning; he's just discovered Jet ('a brilliant pastiche'); he appreciates the fun the Darkness are having; he loved the Scissor Sisters the minute he heard them. </p> <p>His two current favourites, however, are Rufus Wainwright and Ryan Adams. He eulogises about Rufus for a good 10 minutes while barely pausing for breath. 'He's astonishing. He gets up every day and writes; I don't do that. I don't even play the piano unless I have to rehearse. Rufus plays it every day.' </p> <p>He feels protective towards Ryan. The young American's self-destructive streak reminds him of himself. He rings Ryan up from time to time to see how he is. He thinks it's good to offer support; he remembers the Band coming to see him in Philadelphia when he was starting out and, as a fan, he was thrilled. But he also knows how hard it can be to ask for help. </p> <p>He fidgets on the sofa. 'It took me 16 years of stubbornness ... and craziness ... to ask for help. Because I thought it was a sign of weakness. I didn't get sober till 1990 because I struggled to ask for help. So if anybody picks up the phone and asks for a bit of my time, I'll be there for them.' </p> <p>Perhaps it's because he's been through drug and alcohol addiction, because he outed himself before it was really acceptable or fashionable to be gay, because he's been through years and years of therapy, Elton John finds a lot of people come to him for advice. He grins. 'Let's phone up Uncle Elt!' </p> <p>He is proud of his new role as agony uncle to a new generation of artists. But it would be easy to think of him as envying young bands, as craving the thrill of the first taste of fame. Not so; in fact, he can think of nothing worse. 'At the start of my career, I did everything, went everywhere, met everyone. I didn't mind having my photo taken. In fact, I enjoyed it.' He looks terribly serious for the first time. 'Now I'm 57 I loathe it. I find it very difficult to go out without attracting attention ... so I'd rather stay home.' </p> <p>He scowls. 'There is no charisma any more. We know everything about everyone. If I see one more photo of Britney or J-Lo or Ben Affleck, I'm going to spit. I want mystery! That's why Morrissey has had some success again; he's a bit of an enigma. I know I've cultivated this image of myself having tantrums and spending all this money and having nice weekends in my big house in the south of France ... but I really don't think I court publicity like I used to. And I don't want it.' </p> <p>A clock chimes in the background. He glances at his simple but probably incredibly expensive black and white watch. Time is marching on. 'I'll leave all that celebrity stuff to the young guys.' </p> <p>Elton John has lived his life in two parts. The first he spent under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He talks of concerts barely remembered, of hopeless relationships, of spending his money badly ('I collected a lot of appalling art when I was on drugs; your judgment is impaired when you're out of your mind'). He remembers one occasion, when he was staying at an American hotel and he'd been up all night, he rang his London management company and screamed: 'It's too fucking windy here - can you do something about it?' </p> <p>Which is not to say he didn't have a great time too, meeting his heroes. He met Brian Wilson when the Beach Boy had taken to playing his piano in a sandpit in the dining room and listened to 'Good Vibrations' until 4am ('I was simultaneously terrified and in awe of this brilliant man, who is probably the biggest influence on my songwriting'); he got an autograph from Elvis, though he feels cheated as the king was bloated and 'too gone'; he met an 'eccentric' Bob Dylan. </p> <p>In 1973, he spent a lot of time with John Lennon. 'I remember being in a room at the Sherry Netherlands hotel with John and we were both on coke. At 3am there was a knock on the door and we looked through the peephole; it was Andy Warhol. We both stood there, paranoid, whispering: don't let him in!' </p> <p>On 29 July 1990, at the age of 43, Elton John got clean. After months in rehab and therapy, he stopped relying on the drugs and alcohol. By way of distraction, he started to collect photography. Not just the odd photo, naturally, but enough to fill a gallery. In the early Nineties he paid \u00a3120,000 for Man Ray's Tears, then a world record for a photo. He bought an apartment in Atlanta - the only city in the world, he says, where he can live a relatively normal life - and filled it with pieces by contemporary photographers. </p> <p>He didn't lose his sense of fun - he tells some funny stories about his relationship with Rod Stewart, one that has endured since the early Seventies and that has been defined by practical jokes and wind-ups. 'I bought him a Zimmer frame for his 50th birthday and he sent me one of those old-fashioned ladies' hairdryers you sit underneath with the message: \"The only thing I forgot to buy was the hair to go with it.\" It's like a Joan Crawford/Bette Davis relationship. Rod's never lost his vicious British humour, and that's why I adore him.' </p> <p>On 30 October 1993, Elton John fell in love. He'd been on the road for a long time and wanted to meet new people; he had a dinner party at Woodside, the house in Windsor, and David Furnish was one of the guests. Furnish had been a fan - Caribou was the first album he ever bought - and was shy but nonetheless gave Elton his number. 'I knew he was going off to a Halloween party and I always get up very early ... I was trying to work out the earliest I could ring on a Sunday morning.' </p> <p>He laughs. 'At 11am I plucked up the courage to make the call. We had dinner in London that night and talked some more. David was the first person I'd been with who had his own apartment, his own job at Ogilvy and Mather, his own circle of friends. He also wasn't afraid to tell me what he thought.' </p> <p>Elton liked being told he was wrong. He liked being chastised for spending too much money; it was refreshing for him after so many one-sided relationships in which he'd taken control.'I was so relieved that David was willing to challenge me when I lost it. He knew how to handle me and it wasn't with kid gloves.' </p> <p>There is a song for David on Peachtree Road. 'My Elusive Drug' is a touching, bluesy tribute to Elton's lover, written by Bernie Taupin but sung with aching tenderness. Once again, it seems as though Taupin has been telepathic. Elton laughs. 'I might be wrong because Bernie never tells me but that song screams of the fact that I've been through everything, I've tried everything and finally I've found my elusive drug - David. It's a very special song; the Nina Simone song on the album.' </p> <p>Elton John grins. 'It's been 14 years since I got sober. I've got a new album, a great private life, and at 57 I feel excited by life.' </p> <p>As it's such a gorgeous afternoon, we take a walk around Elton's extensive gardens. The dog is over-excited, darting around the Italian garden Elton's late friend Gianni Versace encouraged him to create. He says the past 12 months have been the most creative of his life; not just a new album, but Billy Elliot the Musical (he has written the music to the stage production of the Stephen Daldry film, which premieres this autumn in Newcastle), a Broadway production of The Vampire Lestat (based on the first two Anne Rice novels) and the soundtrack to an animated Disney film called Gnomeo and Juliet. </p> <p>Then there are the concerts. Alongside his never-ending world tours, Elton is in residency in Las Vegas for the next three years, playing a total of 75 shows, in a lavish production designed by David LaChapelle. But he never forsakes the serious for the superficial; his commitment as chairman of the Elton John Aids Foundation is as great as ever, while he also supports breast cancer charities. 'I go out and raise the money; I am the whore,' he says. 'But I don't scream about it all the time.' </p> <p>Elton becomes serious for a moment as he contemplates his 60th birthday. 'There will come a time when my lifestyle has to change. Why I'm still trying to prove something to myself, I don't know. I have a lovely private life with David but we don't spend enough time together.' </p> <p>He pauses, squinting. 'I'm not going to be like the Who and do a farewell tour for the next 15 years, but I am finding it harder, emotionally, to stay on the road.' </p> <p>He looks across the stunning gardens to the house he bought in 1975 in a drugs haze. 'This is home for me. It's where David and I first met. But we don't need the stuff; I'd be happy living in a Winnebago with David because I love him so much.' His eyes are watering. Maybe it's the sun. </p> <p>'I always wanted to buy a big fucking retirement home and live in it with all my friends. An old department store in the King's Road would be perfect. I could run the CD shop, Neil Tennant the bookshop and Sam Taylor-Wood the art shop.' He rubs the dog's head. 'Either that or buy a big chateau in France and just walk around in kaftans eating donuts all day.'</p> <p><strong>The fan club</strong></p> <p><strong> Sam Taylor-Wood:</strong> </p> <p><strong> What's your favourite song of his?</strong><br>'Tiny Dancer'.<br><strong> What makes Elton a living legend?</strong><br>The way he never sits still and endlessly pushes his limits to become what he is.<br><strong> How do you think he will be remembered?</strong><br>Aside from all his amazing achievements ... flowers.<br><strong> What's it like having him as a friend?</strong><br>He's more than a friend; he's my gay husband. </p> <p><strong> Elton on Sam Taylor-Wood:</strong><br>If I wasn't with David, I would love to be with Sam. She's become such an inspiration for me. There isn't a day I don't call her. I love her and Jay [Jopling, Sam's husband] so much. And their daughter, Angelica. I trust her for advice but I also just love her as a person: she's one of the greatest people I've ever met. I would do anything for her. And creatively, she's amazing. She's so full of ideas.</p> <p><strong> Rod Stewart</strong></p> <p><strong>OMM: What's your favourite Elton song?</strong> 'Maggie May'<br><strong> How will he be remembered? </strong> Not only for his music, but his great charity work and also his tremendous sense of humour. He should have been a stand-up comic. He is the funniest man I have ever met.<br><strong> What is he like as a friend?</strong> He's more like a sister.<br> <strong> You've known each other for decades now: what is so special about him?</strong> We have our ups and downs and we don't see each other like we used to in the Seventies. But he is so special, probably because of his unique talent. It's the same reason he's a legend. He is a great singer too, but not quite as good as me. <br><strong> How would you characterise your relationship?</strong><br>Deep mutual respect. Although we can be a little bitchy towards each other, especially me because he has sold more records than I have. But I love him. I almost wish I was gay.<br><strong> How has he changed over the years, musically and personally? </strong> He hasn't changed that much, musically. He is still as excellent as always, but he has broadened his horizons.<br><strong> Is he more talented than you?</strong><br>Yes, always has been and always will be. [smirks] </p> <p><strong> Rufus Wainwright:</strong> </p> <p><strong> OMM: What makes Elton a living legend?</strong><br>His ability to maintain an incredible amount of energy and not become disillusioned with the whole showbusiness thing. Couple that with his incredible chameleon-like talent.<br><strong> What's your favourite song of his? </strong> 'Yellow Brick Road', because I've been on both ends of that equation.<br><strong> How will he be remembered?</strong><br>As a devilish saint who basically sleeps, wakes, eats and shits music.<br><strong> What's it like having him as a friend </strong> It's wonderful, and I wouldn't trade it for all the tea in China. </p> <p><strong> Elvis Costello:</strong> </p> <p><strong> OMM: What makes Elton special?</strong><br>His joy, his knowledge of the musical past, and an impressive curiosity for new music; he knows much more about new releases than many more self-consciously hip artists.<br> <strong> What's your favourite song of his?</strong><br>It changes all the time. One of the more well-known titles would be 'Sorry ...' I heard Ray Charles do it two years ago and it knocked everyone out and made me want to sing it myself. 'Tiny Dancer' has an amazing stucture, too, and a great lift to the chorus. These songs are hard! There are a couple of melodies on the new record which are up there with his best, particularly 'My Elusive Drug' and 'Turn the Lights Out'. Full of unexpected changes. I also love some of those delicate songs from way back, such as 'Come Down in Time' or 'Sixty Years On'... <br><strong> What is he like as a friend?</strong> <br>Elton (and David) have been very loving friends to my wife in the past few years; we have no words to describe their kindness to us as a couple. It is amazing that anyone who works so hard could find time to check in on friends not doing so well or simply to be so gracious, courteous and wickedly humoured. This life often makes people much more selfish. </p> <p><strong> Graham Taylor</strong> </p> <p><strong> What makes Elton a living legend?</strong><br>The man is so talented as a professional musician - forget the pop star stuff. You don't stay at the top of that profession without working at it. He applies his talent to his job better than anyone I have met.<br><strong> What's your favourite song of his?</strong><br>'Candle in the Wind' is my favourite - it has been ever since it first came out - but 'I'm Still Standing' is strangely appropriate for both Elton and myself!<br><strong> How will he be remembered?</strong><br>As a great musical talent and a wonderful showman <br><strong> What is he like as a friend?</strong><br>I count myself as very fortunate to have been a part of Elton's life.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>To raise funds for the Elton John Aids Foundation, Elton and Sam Taylor-Wood have given us a signed print of our cover photograph to auction.<br>If you would like to bid for the photograph simply send us a letter stating how much you would be willing to pay, with full contacts details including your phone number.

  "<p>'House slip' screamed the Sun. 'Homes in Price Drop' yelled the Mirror. Even the Times chipped in with 'House prices suffer biggest fall since 2000'. </p> <p>If the headlines are to be believed, we are already caught up in a house-price crash. Two of Britain's best-known economists turned the national preoccupation with house prices into theatre last week with a public debate on the subject. Roger Bootle, of Capital Economics, known for his conviction that prices are set to fall dramatically, was challenged to defend his theory by Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research, who believes that we can live comfortably with property prices at higher levels than in the past. </p> <p>As the economists were expounding their theories, Cash canvassed the market to find out what is really going on as homeowners, buyers and estate agents prepare for the pre-Christmas marketing season. Our research suggests that, for now at least, Congdon's view has the edge. </p> <p><strong> Whither house prices?</strong></p> <p> Yes, the rate of increase in prices has slowed down, but, with the exception of London and a few other limited areas, it has not stopped or gone into reverse. Nick Freeth, area managing director for Bradford &amp; Bingley Estate Agents in the Wessex region, says: 'Prices aren't moving forward significantly, but they are not moving backwards either. Prices have settled and I would expect them to remain so.' </p> <p>The story is the same in East Anglia. Max Sowerby of the Sowerbys estate agency chain on the north Norfolk coast thinks that prices could remain stable for as long as three years. 'Our prices went stable nine to 10 months ago. If properties had continued increasing at the rate they were, we would be looking for a downturn now.' </p> <p>Prices at the top end of the London market - homes costing \u00a31 million-plus - were hit last year by the lack of international buyers and a dearth of bonuses paid to City workers. </p> <p>Liam Bailey, head of residential research for Knight Frank, says that prices in this sector fell by an average of 2 per cent, while Kensington was particularly badly affected, falling by 7.3 per cent. But prices regained an average 3.7 per cent in the first six months of the year and have now stabilised. Upmarket country properties were even worse-hit, falling by about 10 per cent in value last year. </p> <p>But Bailey says: 'This type of purchase is aspirational, and can always be put off to another year when the bonuses start coming in again. The majority of that decline was recouped in the first six months of this year, but the market has slowed considerably over the summer.' </p> <p>The slowdown has even reached the north, usually the last area to be affected. Jane Pridgeon, managing director of Halifax Estate Agents, says: 'The market has followed the traditional pattern. What started in London and the south east has been quickly followed by the Midlands and the north.' </p> <p><strong> Should you be scared?</strong></p> <p> Homeowners should not read anything sinister into the speed and spread of the slowdown, however. Milan Khatri, chief economist at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, says: 'There's been quite an abrupt slowdown over the past three or four months, but interest rates have risen sharply. Although they are still low, they have actually gone up by a third, so it's bound to have an impact.' </p> <p>Khatri thinks house prices would have slowed down without the intervention of rate rises by the end of the year simply because house- price inflation was far exceeding that of wages. But other factors that have contributed to price crashes in the past - high interest rates, the removal of tax breaks and, most importantly, high unemployment - are not a problem today. </p> <p>Most homeowners have reacted calmly to the news. Estate agents report that the flow of new stock onto the market is steady, ironically because people who are thinking about selling now feel it's safe. The amount they can ask for their current home will not be diminished by galloping inflation while they are looking for a new one. </p> <p>Pridgeon says: 'In 2003, new houses coming on to the market started to drop off significantly from March. It picked up a little in September, but not enough. The shortage caused house price inflation. Sellers were frightened they wouldn't find a house to buy, and that by the time they did it would cost too much. </p> <p>'But in 2004 new houses have been coming on to the market pretty constantly. Customers are telling us that they now feel more confident about putting [their homes] on the market because prices have stabilised and there's a good choice for them to look at.' </p> <p><strong> The landlord effect</strong></p> <p> Some property pundits have speculated that a crash could be sparked off by amateur landlords becoming disenchanted with the hassle and cost of running their investments and putting them up for sale. </p> <p>However Rics' Khatri says that although some buy-to-let landlords have sold up in Yorkshire, Humberside and Wales, there is no evidence of this happening elsewhere. And even if landlords decided en masse to retire from the business, the proportion of property they own is so small it would have 'very little impact on supply'. </p> <p><strong> What can you expect to sell for?</strong></p> <p> Provided both agents and sellers are realistic about the prices they ask for their homes, they will find a seller, says Tim Wright of Knight Frank's Kensington branch. </p> <p>He says that some of the 'price falls' highlighted in recent newspaper articles are actually sellers readjusting their asking prices after failing to sell their homes over the summer. </p> <p>He explains that people who put their homes on the market in the spring set high prices because they expected inflation to increase the value of their properties while they were being sold. But the rise in interest rates and the Bank of England's pessimism about property prices caused inflation to stall, leaving the asking prices looking expensive. </p> <p>Wright recommends that prospective sellers check out prices of similar properties in their area in local newspapers and estate agency windows. Then invite three agents round to provide valuations and select the one that comes up with a sensible price in line with other properties on the market. </p> <p>Buyers were 'gung-ho' last year, prepared to take part in bidding auctions and to pay above the odds, confident that the value of their new home would soon catch up with the price they paid for it. </p> <p>But this autumn they are much more cautious - and determined to negotiate a competitive deal. </p> <p>Caroline Bell, director of the Putney office of FPD Savills says: 'If they are renting or haven't got a property to sell, they do seem to think they have an automatic right to a discount. They're looking for up to 20 per cent off the asking price in some cases. They're not getting away with it, but it's quite frustrating.' </p> <p>If you're a buyer it's worth trying for a discount, but bear in mind that sellers are setting prices at more realistic levels.</p> <p><strong>Confused? You should be</strong></p> <p>House prices were both speeding up and slowing down, according to figures released last week. </p> <p>On Monday, data from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) recorded a 2.1 per cent rise in house prices in July, compared with 1.7 per cent in June.</p> <p>By Wednesday, however, the market was falling, with the National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) reporting that the average property price had fallen for the third consecutive month in August. August figures from Halifax and Nationwide show a slowdown, with Halifax showing a 0.6 per cent fall in prices and Nationwide a 0.1 per cent gain month on month (compared with 2.1 per cent the previous month).</p> <p>The ODPM gets the data for its index from all the lenders, so is likely to show a slowing down or fall for August when it eventually publishes its figures later this autumn. But how come the NAEA results showed a fall in June and July, when the ODPM, Nationwide and Halifax indices were still positive? 'The NAEA is based on asking prices,' says a spokeswoman, 'whereas the Nationwide, Halifax and ODPM are based on valuations. This means the NAEA results are more up-to-date: they reflect what is happening in the estate agency that month, whereas the valuation-based indices show what was happening several months previously.'</p> <p><strong>Yours for \u00a3350,000 less</strong></p> <p>The former head of one of Britain's biggest estate agency chains has had to reduce the asking price on his London apartment by \u00a3350,000. </p> <p>Christopher Rodrigues, who resigned as chief executive of Bradford and Bingley earlier this year to take up top position at Visa in the US, has been trying to sell a five-bedroom penthouse flat overlooking Holland Park since March without any success. He decided to cut the \u00a32.85 million asking price by 12 per cent at the end of August and immediately attracted interest from potential buyers.</p> <p>'We spoke to a number of estate agents at the beginning of the year about where the market was,' he says. 'They were fairly closely packed about the same price, with outriders 20 per cent above and below. We agreed to go with the price in the middle of the range -\u00a32.85m.' At this level, he and his wife would have been prepared to negotiate bids below the asking price.</p> <p>Given the renewed interest in the property, he would not be surprised to reach the same price he was hoping for before, even from the lower asking price.</p> <p>'As it transpires, the market did flatten and if you want to be attractive you have to be fairly price-sensitive.'</p> <p>The 3,200 sq ft apartment includes a large drawing room, dining room, three bathrooms and full-size artist's studio with 17-ft north-facing skylight (his wife is an artist). The property comes with a 998- year lease and share of the freehold.</p> <p>The couple have decided not to buy in the US, as they regard the UK as their ultimate home.</p> <p>Instead they are renting an apartment overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. So does his selling the Kensington apartment indicate that he thinks now is the time to get out of the UK property market?</p> <p>'We were a bit long on London property - we have an apartment in West End Quay near Paddington as well, and now that the children have grown up we don't need all those bedrooms.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For further information about the apartment, call Knight Frank on 020 7938 4311.</p>",
  "<p>It seems only right that Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9 has invited me to the Wolseley, one of London's hottest new restaurants, to discuss The Desk, the new BBC4 media programme he is fronting from next January. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 will be forever be known as the founder of Wallpaper*, the unapologetically aspirational interiors magazine about 'the stuff that surrounds you', so this feels like his natural habitat.</p> <p>Self-proclaimed style gurus always invite sartorial scrutiny and it is impossible to resist the temptation to analyse Br\u00fbl\u00e9's appearance (for the record, he is immaculately turned out, in a blue jacket, charcoal grey V-neck, slightly faded jeans and pale blue shirt.) The Desk will be subject to a similar level of scrutiny from the back-biting media world, which greeted with surprise the news that Br\u00fbl\u00e9's 'multi-disciplined creative agency' Wink and producer Anne Reevell - who launched Radio 4's media show Medium Wave - had been commissioned to produce The Desk. </p> <p>A host of well-established media commentators and TV presenters pitched for the coveted 30-programme run, including Paul Merton, Kirsty Wark, and former Times media editor Ray Snoddy. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 concedes that he was surprised to land the show so soon after renewing his acquaintance with Reevell, whom he first met when he was a young freelance reporter and occasional Medium Wave contributor. </p> <p>'We hooked up again to work on a concept for a smart, more euro-centric morning news show for one of the terrestrials and the BBC4 request came up during that process', he says, adding that he is prepared for the inevitable sniping about style triumphing over substance. </p> <p>'It's the nature of the business. People have trouble coming to grips with the fact that you can actually move quite easily between a TV newsroom floor to Kabul's backstreets to the editor's chair of a glossy magazine.' </p> <p>Br\u00fbl\u00e9 was shot in Afghanistan in 1994 while working as a freelance, and worked for a UK financial news channel, so he does not lack a serious side. </p> <p>He points out that Wallpaper* ran some ground-breaking articles, including 'the first piece on al-Jazeera', and his business track record is undeniably impressive. He sold Wallpaper* to AOL Time Warner for just over \u00a31 million in 1999 and went on to set up Wink to provide design, advertising, branding and marketing advice to clients including Marks and Spencer - it designed the infamous M&amp;S Lifestore in Gateshead - and Selfridges. He recently bought the business back from AOL Time Warner. </p> <p>Even so, The Desk's set is likely to be analysed as closely as its content. 'We're damned either way. If we don't have an incredible set people will ask why not, and if we do they will criticise us,' Br\u00fbl\u00e9 says, adding, lest there be any doubt, 'the sets will be fantastic'. </p> <p>He is unapologetic about his desire to create an appealing on-screen aesthetic. 'I want to take my print experience and apply it to the screen. Just as every page of a magazine is exquisitely crafted we want to bring the same attention to detail to The Desk. Contributors will not only be thoroughly briefed but also well groomed. There's nothing worse than showing up to do a TV show and the people in the control let guests on air with stained ties and bed head.' </p> <p>Given the media world's propensity for self-indulgent navel-gazing, it is remarkable that it has had to wait this long for a dedicated half-hour TV show. (The last one was Channel 4's Media Show, which disappeared from screens in 1991). But Br\u00fbl\u00e9 is determined to avoid aping the parochial outlook of many media pundits, whose pronouncement may interest guests at a north London dinner party but lack broader appeal. </p> <p>'The exciting thing about a BBC4 commission is that we can be quite highbrow and challenging [but] I don't want to use all the usual faces,' he says. ' The Desk should talk to both the core BBC4 viewer and the trade.' The programme will have a determinedly global perspective, hardly surprising since the Canadian-born Br\u00fbl\u00e9 moved to London at an early age, has a summer house in Sweden and lives for much of the year in Zurich. </p> <p>He talks of 'sending someone to San Francisco to cover Apple's financials ('as relevant to British viewers as it is to an American audience' ) and 'keeping an eye on what [iPod designer] Jonathan Ive is up to at the Apple design centre'. </p> <p>Overseas trends will be identified and analysed, he says, offering up a particularly pertinent example. 'The British trade press takes any launch as fresh and new and rarely reveals that many concepts have been lifted from overseas newsstands. The Desk should blow the whistle on these \"fresh, original\" launches when necessary. There's no reason we can't say \"OK this format is new to the UK newspaper market, but it has been around in Sweden for 10 years\".' </p> <p>There will be live satellite links to correspondents on the east coast of America and features on Brazil's new rolling 24-hours news services. 'When I took back the agency [Wink] I took a lot of Wallpaper*'s correspondents on retainers. We'll be using people in Sao Paulo, Beirut, Singapore, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Barcelona and New York to feed into our newsdesk.'</p> <p>Although Br\u00fbl\u00e9 made his reputation in magazines, he started in television, working as a reporter on Janet Street-Porter's youth-orientated current affairs programme Reportage in the late 1980s. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 believes London is now the world's leading media centre. 'When I first got here in 1989, I thought \"have I come to the wrong place?\" because everyone was travelling the other way. There was a time when you had to go to New York to make it in the media world.' But no more. 'London has overtaken New York, at least creatively. America's tough immigration policies make it more difficult to show up as a freelancer at JFK and hope they'll let you in to write or design.' </p> <p>The globalisation of the media marketplace has also benefited London, he says. 'London has become the international news hub.

  "<p><strong>The Greek Passion </strong> Royal Opera House, London WC2</p> <p><strong>Another American: Fire</strong> Sadler's Wells, London EC1</p> <p>The Royal Opera opens its season with a shot to the heart of our times: Bohuslav Martinu's searing drama <strong> The Greek Passion</strong>, about society's rejection of the destitute and desperate when they arrive at our gates for help, shelter and asylum. </p> <p>The work is one of art's most powerful allegories on this eternal theme; apart from being a retelling of the Crucifixion, it is a piece about a world that casts its unwanted and persecuted along what Bob Dylan called 'the unarmed road of flight'. </p> <p>Martinu wrote that the opera, with which he wrestled and finished while fighting stomach cancer, had 'two great themes like thin trickles of blood: the heritage of man's Christian values and his obligations to humanity'. The Czech composer never saw his masterpiece performed; it was premiered in 1961, two years after his death. </p> <p>Martinu, a blacklisted refugee from the Third Reich and exile from communism, began work on his last opera in the mid 1950s, in the aftermath of a time when Europe was a continent of people wandering in search (and usually in vain) of loved and lost ones, after the hurricane of violence that was the Second World War. </p> <p>But neither Martinu nor, indeed, Covent Garden is delivering a history lesson. Like all great allegory, this performance - a revival of a David Pountney production which won an Olivier Award in 2000 - speaks to whichever audience beholds The Greek Passion. It speaks about that audience and its world, about those who claim to lead it; about its own responsibilities and sensibilities. </p> <p>The inhabitants of a Greek village prepare to play out Christ's Passion, when they are confronted by a band of wandering, starving refugees seeking to encamp on a nearby mountainside. Gradually, each character assumes his or her role in real life, with the Christ figure, Manolios, slain, with official sanction, for his preaching of compassion towards the arrivals. </p> <p>Pountney's set is a multi-layered evocation of the Stations of the Cross, while Sir Charles Mackerras, the podium's greatest advocate and interpreter of Czech music, captures both the intimate and the epic in this opera, both the allegory and its meaning. His orchestra illuminates from within Martinu's distinctive, rich Czech lyricism, punctuated by Greek folk music. </p> <p>This is the closest Martinu gets to echoing the realism of Leos Janacek, that genius of the opera and Mackerras's favourite. It is a timbre Martinu mastered even though - and maybe because - he had lived two decades in tormented exile from his beloved homeland. </p> <p>There is a compelling balance between the two principals: the veteran Willard White sings a commanding and charismatic Fotis, the refugees' spiritual sage, while, as Manolios, tenor Christopher Ventris, an embryonic Wagnerian for sure, builds his performance forcefully, towards its poignant climax. </p> <p>Before he is stoned to death by the mob - while the village priest and his cronies wine and dine - Manolios appeals to the people on the refugees' part: 'Their children are starving,' he pleads, 'they lie dead on the hillside. Can you watch children dying from hunger before your eyes without rising up and demanding an account, even from God?' </p> <p>The 'order' of the village authorities is then restored by the Messiah's murder, and the refugees exit, on to the road again, winding a ponderous, lachrymose way through the orchestra stalls of the opera house, thus implicating us into their fate. </p> <p>The impact of this performance is directed beyond the stage and theatre - it lies in what Martinu's universal work has to say in Britain today. It speaks aptly to a nation to which thousands come in flight from starvation, war, persecution and famine. A nation busy erecting walls against such arrivals and entrenching a culture which, rather than try to exist convivially with those in need, increasingly defiles the word 'asylum' with brutish tabloid journalism and the politics of paranoia. </p> <p>The notion that diversity can nurture high art has propelled the Push '04 project this summer. Push is becoming a roadshow of, as it says, 'black-led' performances and attitude which last Thursday rolled up at Sadler's Wells, for a premiere of the specially commissioned opera <strong> Another America: Fire</strong>, by Errollyn Wallen, singer composer, musician, renaissance woman of contemporary British music. </p> <p>But this is not just musical affirmative action in action. In an effervescent atmosphere, the Push cast staged its opera about the first black woman astronaut, off to Mars. </p> <p>The score is textually varied between jagged modern edges, lyricism and African chant, while the plot is a sort of blend between Alex Hayley's Roots and 2001: A Space Odyssey, with ancient ancestors urging on the heroine, Asante, on her interplanetary mission. </p> <p>The evening was carried, though, by the crystalline voice of Jacqueline Miura, an established Carmen in her native Sweden, as Asante casts off her demons and doubts to heed the ancients' advice and: 'Fly, Asante, fly.' Which she duly did, as will Push if it continues in this vein, to return another year. </p> <p><strong>Three to see</strong></p> <p><strong>Werther</strong> Royal Opera House, London WC2 (Fri)</p> <p>New production of Massenet's portrayal of Goethe's melancholy poet.</p> <p><strong>Manon Lescaut</strong> The Grand, Leeds (Thurs &amp; Sat) </p> <p>Opera North's tale of beauty ensnared by greed. </p> <p><strong>Christoph von Dohanyi </strong>Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (Thurs) <br>75th birthday with the Philharmonic Orchestra playing Strauss and Beethoven.</p>",
  "<p>It is billed as reality TV's next blockbuster, but a week before it starts, Channel Five's The Farm has been forced to defend itself against the sort of controversy that usually dogs some of its C-list contestants. </p> <p>As the likes of David Beckham's one-time translator, Rebecca Loos, and model Sophie Anderton prepare for three gruelling weeks spent as farm hands, animal welfare groups have called for the programme to be pulled. </p> <p>They are outraged that the celebrities, who also include magician Paul Daniels and his wife, Debbie McGee, are to perform skilled tasks including 'de-budding' - in which red-hot pokers are used to remove nascent horns on cattle - and 'dagging' - cutting dried faeces from sheep's wool. </p> <p>But the programme's makers argue that The Farm will be the first popular TV show to make consumers confront how food ends up on their plates. </p> <p>'We're trying to reflect real farm life,' said Ben Frow, controller of features and entertainment at Five. ' This is not about cheap titillation. The moment it becomes sleazy, it's doomed.' </p> <p>A French version of the series ended in lawsuits after 15 chickens died during filming. ' We are learning from their mistakes and taking extreme precautions. I want these animals to be the best cared for in Britain,' Frow said. </p> <p>The argument has been given short shrift by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which wants the programme scrapped. Compassion in World Farming has also sounded alarm bells. </p> <p>'We are concerned the animals are being exploited for entertainment purposes,' said communications director Kerry Burgess. 'We're especially concerned about what the celebrities will be asked to do. The government code recommends that dehorning is \"ideally\" carried out by a veterinary surgeon. Likewise, ear tagging should be done by a properly trained person.' However, Burgess said the group acknowledged that the show might help to educate consumers. </p> <p>Five also insists that all contestants will be given adequate training and vets will be on call at all times. It also points out that the animals will be subject to 'best practice' farming guidelines, reared in conditions that are far better than those endured by the majority of livestock. </p> <p>Inspectors from Defra have also given their backing to the show, the latest reality TV offering from Big Brother production company Endemol, whose boss, Peter Bazalgette, dreamt up the BBC's Food and Drink series. </p> <p>Richard Guy, chairman of the Real Meat Company, whose farm in Warminster, Wiltshire, houses the show's set, said he believed it would open people's minds as the BBC series had done. </p> <p>'It's a popular programme that deals with serious issues,' said Guy, a farmer of some 30 years' experience who has helped Food and Drink to expose cruel treatment of farm animals. </p> <p>'The shock value is going to be high. Debudding looks horrendous, but virtually all dairy cattle are debudded. It's necessary to protect the animals from each other. If you drink milk, eat cheese or a Magnum ice cream, you've benefited from it.' </p> <p>Guy said he hoped the programme would help people to make up their minds about farming. 'When I started in 1976 with my first pig, killing it seemed callous. But if you don't like the methods involved, you shouldn't eat pork. If you don't like what you see on the programme, you shouldn't eat meat.'</p>",
  "Bloated, blue-collar Americans - gorged on diets of fries and burgers, but denied their share of US riches - are bringing the nation's steady rise in life expectancy to a grinding halt. <p>Twenty years ago, the US, the richest nation on the planet, led the world's longevity league. Today, American women rank only 19th, while males can manage only 28th place, alongside men from Brunei. </p> <p>These startling figures are blamed by researchers on two key factors: obesity, and inequality of health care. A man born in a poor area of Washington can have a life expectancy that is 40 years less than a woman in a prosperous neighbourhood only a few blocks away, for example. </p> <p>'A look at the Americans' health reveals astonishing inequalities in our society,' state Professor Lawrence Jacobs of Minnesota University and Professor James Morone, of Brown University, Rhode Island, in the journal American Prospect . </p> <p>Their paper is one of a recent swathe of studies that have uncovered a shocking truth: America, once the home of the world's best-fed, longest-lived people, is now a divided nation made up of a rich elite and a large underclass of poor, ill-fed, often obese, men and women who are dying early. </p> <p>In another newly published paper, statisticians at Boston College reveal that in France, Japan and Switzerland, men and women aged 65 now live several years longer than they do in the US. Indeed, America only just scrapes above Mexico and most East European nations. </p> <p>This decline is astonishing given America's wealth. Not only is it Earth's richest nation, it devotes more gross domestic product - 13 per cent - to health care than any other developed nation. Switzerland comes next with 10 per cent; Britain spends 7 per cent. As the Boston group - Alicia Munnell, Robert Hatch and James Lee - point out: 'The richer a country is, the more resources it can dedicate to education, medical and other goods and services associated with great longevity.' The result in every other developed country has been an unbroken rise in life expectancy since 1960. </p> <p>But this formula no longer applies to America, where life expectancy's rise has slowed but not yet stopped, because resources are now so unevenly distributed. When the Boston College group compared men and women in America's top 10 per cent wage bracket with those in the bottom ten per cent, they found the former group earned 17 times more than the latter. In Japan, Switzerland and Norway, this ratio is only five-to-one. </p> <p>Jacobs and Morone state: 'Check-ups, screenings and vaccinations save lives, improve well-being, and are shockingly uneven [in America]. Well-insured people get assigned hospital beds; the uninsured get patched up and sent back to the streets.' For poor Americans, health service provision is little better than that in third world nations. 'People die younger in Harlem than in Bangladesh,' report Jacobs and Morone. </p> <p>Consumption of alcohol, tobacco and food can also have a huge impact on life expectancy. The first two factors are not involved with America's longevity crisis. Smoking and drinking are modest compared with Europe. Food consumption is a different matter, however, for the US has experienced an explosion in obesity rates in the past 20 years. As a result, 34 per cent of all women in the US are obese compared with 4 per cent in Japan. For men, the figures are 28 and 2 per cent respectively. </p> <p>'US obesity rates jumped in the 1980s and 1990s, and the vast majority of the population affected by obesity had not yet reached age 65 by 2000,' state the Boston group. 'As the large baby boom cohort begins to turn 65 in coming years, a stronger connection between obesity rates and life expectancy may emerge.' </p> <p>In other words, as the nation's middle-aged fatties reach retirement age, more and more will start to die out. Life expectancy in the US could then actually go into decline.</p>",
  "When Kirsty MacColl died in 2000 after being hit by a speedboat while scuba-diving in Mexico, her many friends in the musical world from Bono to Billy Bragg were shocked by what seemed then like a tragic accident. <p>One the most admired female singer-songer writers of her generation, MacColl came from a musical dynasty that helped to shape British popular music. </p> <p>Since her death, relatives of the singer led by her mother, Jean MacColl, have battled to find out who really killed Kirsty. They have long suspected a cover-up and despite two investigations believe the real culprit - the son of a millionaire retail tycoon - has never been brought to justice. </p> <p>Last week the family secured an important breakthrough when the Mexican Foreign Secretary, Luis Ernesto Debez, visited the House of Commons. At a meeting of the All Parliamentary Group on Mexico he told politicians he would review the case and act if the proper processes had not been followed or if there was any evidence of corruption. </p> <p>Jean MacColl welcomed this development as 'excellent news'. She said: 'We thank the Mexican government for their help and now hope these words are followed up by action and we can finally get justice for Kirsty.' </p> <p>Baroness Miller, vice-chair of the parliamentary group, said: 'He was very well briefed on the case and promised to look at it again. I came away very optimistic.' </p> <p>Last year, an illiterate deckhand, Jose Cen Yam, was found guilty of culpable homicide after he was alleged to have been driving the powerboat at the time it tore into Kirsty. Although he was sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison he was allowed to pay a \u00a361 fine and walk free. Yet the family's own investigation, which involved hiring private investigators, unearthed a range of witnesses suggesting a cover-up. </p> <p>The powerboat in question, the 31ft Percalito was registered offshore in Guernsey and belonged to Guillermo Gonzalez Nova, the 67-year-old boss of one of Mexico's largest companies, Comercial Mexicana, which owns a chain of stores and restaurants. It emerged that Nova was on the boat with his family including his two sons and granddaughter. MacColl's family believe that one of the tycoon's sons was at the helm. </p> <p>MacColl was diving with her two teenage sons at the Chankanaab Reef, about 300m offshore, a popular site where boats were prohibited from travelling more than four knots. The twin-engined Percalito was travelling more than five times that. </p> <p>The initial police investigation revealed that Cen Yam's main job was to carry out maintenance on the Percalito and he had no licence to drive the boat, nor had he ever taken the Percalito's helm before. At the trial he was unable to answer basic questions and was confused between left and right. </p> <p>Dive-master, Ivan Diaz, who was with the singer when she was hit, said in a statement to the authorities: 'After they ran over us, I saw Cen Yam jump forwards from the back of the boat, to the controls. I couldn't see who was at the wheel because the bow was so high out of the water.' Although he did not see who was at the wheel, Diaz said Nova's two sons were in the front, nearest the controls. </p> <p>In March, Mexican federal authorities agreed to reconsider the case after Kirsty's mother visited the island of Cozumel where the accident took place. Yet hopes of a breakthrough were dashed when the federal prosecutor abandoned the investigation. </p> <p>The MacColl family were outraged by the decision particularly after they found that the key witness, the supermarket tycoon, was never interviewed. Jean MacColl hopes to appeal directly to Mexico's attorney-general. She also intends to stage a fundraising concert for the Justice For Kirsty Campaign.</p>",
  "What John Betjeman started, David Brent appears to have finished. Fact, as the Brentmeister General himself might have put it. The boss from hell, of the vainglorious managerial aspirations and mangled aphorisms in BBC2's hit comedy series The Office, has turned Slough into such a national joke that businesses no longer want to rent space in the Berkshire town even though the economy is picking up. <p>Commercial property specialists Lambert Smith Hampton report that a third of the town's office space lies empty at a time when the local rental market is heating up after two years in the doldrums. At the height of the dotcom boom in 2000, renting office space in Slough cost \u00a332 a square foot. Today the same space goes for \u00a320. </p> <p>'Other towns like Maidenhead have enjoyed two good quarters,' said Martin Gibbons, associate director at Lambert Smith Hampton. 'But Slough has been slow to respond. The Office has certainly not been positive for the town. </p> <p>'The problem is there is a big oversupply of office space and as a result there is a pretty rapid readjustment going on. A number of buildings are being demolished and replaced with high-quality apartments which will sell for between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3220,000.' </p> <p>Slough's attempt to gentrify itself, three years after The Office hit the screen, was welcomed on Friday morning by its army of office workers who are fed up with the town's image. One employee with a major UK company, who asked not to be named, said: 'I always say Slough is the only town that's twinned with itself. </p> <p>'On the high street the gastronomic highlight is Mr Cod. You might think this is a fish and chip shop, but it only sells chicken. This tells you everything you need to know about Slough.' </p> <p>Admittedly, with its myriad roundabouts and row upon row of industrial units, Slough has never enjoyed the greatest of profiles. In 1937, Betjeman, later the Poet Laureate, urged: 'Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough, It isn't fit for humans now.' </p> <p>But it was The Office, chronicling Brent's humdrum life as a regional manager with paper manufacturer Wernham Hogg, which thrust the town to the forefront of Britain's consciousness. From the opening credits showing the brutal-looking Brunel bus station to gags about the local nightclub's door policy ('women with Wonderbras get in free') the series articulated Betjeman's sentiments to a new generation. </p> <p>In a desperate attempt to improve Slough's image, the local council asked Brent's creator, the comedian Ricky Gervais, to become a roving ambassador who could enthuse about its green spaces, its ice rink, where Torvill and Dean practised, and the factory where Mars bars were made. Gervais declined, but not everyone from the town bears him a grudge. </p> <p>'It can act as an ice-breaker when you tell people where you work at parties,' said Gibbons. 'Crossbow House, where The Office was set, is one of our most successful properties. It's 100 per cent full and it's made me a lot of money.' </p> <p>In public at least, Slough-based businesses extol its virtues. Simon Gordon, spokesman for mobile phone giant O2, who commutes from leafy Twickenham, every day said: 'Slough is very much alive. O2 is here because it offers great rail, road and air links and the rates are competitive. In the words of Ricky Gervais, the grass isn't always greener on the other side and certainly not as lush as the O2-sponsored roundabout, which featured in The Office opening credits and is seen by tens of thousands of potential new customers every day.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, even the hapless Brent was aware of Slough's limitations. 'My world does not end within these four walls, Slough's a big place,' he once boasted. 'And when I've finished with Slough, there's Reading, Aldershot, Bracknell, Didcot, Yately, Taplow...'</p>",
  "This is the England that is all but lost: thatched cottages nestling behind rose gardens, rattling tractors that clog the narrow lanes. Village shops which sell home-made meringues and apple pies instead of lotto cards and chewing gum. To a city-dweller who finds himself roaming the rolling fields of north Wiltshire, even the traditional red telephone boxes seem impossibly nostalgic. <p>The fields are populated not by cattle but groups of strutting horses, a clue that this is deep hunting territory. </p> <p>Yet scratch the quaintness and it soon becomes clear the shires are seething. Last Wednesday, when the Countryside Alliance held a 10,0000-strong protest in Parliament Square, something snapped in rural Britain. On the same day five men, who became known as the Ledbury Set after the region of ultra-rural England they hailed from, calmly walked into the Houses of Parliament and made it into the Commons chamber before being apprehended in a flurry of be-stockinged security guards. Hunting was back on the front pages. </p> <p>On Friday in Wiltshire the talk was of class war, betrayal and increasing retribution. Half the livelihoods in the area would be undermined by a ban on fox hunting, say residents. Everyone would know someone affected. Even the local radio station is called Fox FM. </p> <p>In the village of Badminton, the tension hung heavy last week. Outside the gates of the acclaimed Beaufort Hunt, supported by Prince Charles and close to the prestigious Beaufort Polo Club run by the parents of one of the protesters, Luke Tomlinson, stable hands mused darkly over why Tony Blair was so keen to 'persecute the country folk'. </p> <p>Wayne Lees recalled how those who had attended last week's demonstration in London wandered into his village shop the morning after. Most stopped to gaze at the morning papers, shaking their heads at the images of bleeding scalps of comrades as they were beaten back by the police. Some delicately tried to pick up a copy, but couldn't: their knuckles had been broken by police batons. </p> <p>'We'd always felt different, but the deal with Blair was that you leave us alone and we'll just carry on. It's just started,' said one who swore revenge and had an ugly purple welt running along a thin forearm to prove he had popped into Parliament Square last week. Similar stories, similar vows of retribution, echoed from village to village. </p> <p>People remembered how they volunteered to assist the government, helping to cull their animals during the foot-and-mouth crisis. Shopkeeper Wayne Lees, Bristol-born and still considered a townie after 12 years in Badminton, said: 'To take away something like this and replace it with nothing seems foolish.' And it is not just hunters staring into the abyss. A hunting ban would leave no one untouched, the impact rippling through the community - farriers, saddlers, grocers, post office, vets, the pub all affected. </p> <p>Evidence of its vital role is everywhere - from the rain-soaked notes offering horsebox repairs, to the pink slips advertising the next hunt. The Grant's family saddlery firm has stood hidden within the tight backstreets of Malmesbury, Wiltshire, for the past 70 years. An unremarkable facade, save for the crest of the Prince of Wales above the door. </p> <p>Grants and Son supply equipment to the Beaufort. Mainly, though, 'everyday folk' request \u00a3600 hand-made whips and cow-hide saddles. A hunting ban will mean a 75 per cent loss of income. </p> <p>Richard's son Harry, 16, wants to follow family tradition. That may never happen, creating another generation of angry souls certain to rail at the present government. The Grants may have the seal of royalty but in Blair's Britain their skill - saddlery requires a four-year apprenticeship - could see them winding up in the local job centres, or commuting to Bristol or Swindon to work in an office, or selling up and moving away from an area already suffering from a steady influx of those from 'upcountry' - house prices here have risen three-fold over the past decade. Malmesbury now stands on the verge of seeing its first \u00a31m property, with one townhouse currently on sale for \u00a3950,000. </p> <p>They are London prices for London people, the locals say, something for the metroplitan elite who, like Blair and his MPs, do not understand country ways. 'You do get the odd one coming down here and moaning about cow muck on the road, or dirt on their vintage sports car,' said local estate agent Keith Maslin. </p> <p>'Even I get, \"Where are you from?\"' said Maslin, born in Chippenham, 11 miles down the road and a resident of the village for 17 years. Close by in the Kings Arms Hotel, landlady Hilary Timms, a Liverpudlian, has watched with interest the resentment afforded to some incomers. 'The older people in particular don't like them.' </p> <p>Under the low ceilings of the Rattlebone Inn in Sherston, a former playground of Tomlinson along with Prince William and Harry, suspicion weighed heavily against those who had ventured from the metropolis in the wake of last Wednesday. Eventually The Observer was asked to leave. Comparable hostility greeted 'outsiders' in the Old Ship Inn in Luckington three miles down the road. Many predict already hard attitudes to city folk can only harden. 'What will it be next they they try and ban? Shooting? Fishing? Where will it end?' asked Barnes. </p> <p>Many townies though couldn't care what privileged rural folk lose. As Britain's cities fight increasing congestion and crime, weariness over subsidising the lifestyle of millions has never been higher. 'We live in a country where the taxes of city-dwellers subsidise the lifestyles of people in the country,' said Dr Simon Parker, Lecturer in Politics University of York and author of Urban Theory and the Urban Experience , who believes the motives of the Ledbury Set are as self-serving as their lifestyles suggest. </p> <p>'There are indeed pockets of rural deprivation, but that is not what this is about. These are extremely wealthy individuals and their retainers. They are trying to make out that they are representing people who have lost their buses and post offices.' </p> <p>But it will take more than Parker's indifference to deter Britain's new radicals. They are the new revolutionaries - dashing, charismatic young men, with impossibly good bone structure. But these latter-day Che Guevaras are not working class heroes. They are rural community heroes. </p> <p>The traditional radicals - anti-globalisation protestors and poll-tax rioters - all succeeded in bringing London to a halt. None though would dare enter the debating chamber of the Mother of Parliaments. But for their supporters on the libertarian, radical right, the five young 'musketeers' have become a potent touchstone for those prepared to fight for the principle of freedom. </p> <p>The past week will be remembered for one of the most audacious acts in Parliament's long history. It remains to be seen whether it will mark the death throes of an increasingly desperate cause or the beginning of a serious dissent movement whose connections run from royalty to the horsey set to terrier boys. The potential power of last week's Commons intruders cannot be ignored. </p> <p>Ever since his mother Lucy gestured him towards a foot high stack of newspapers following his release from prison before dawn on Friday, a devilish smile has played across the face of Otis Ferry, Britain's new pin-up. Still clad in the police-issue boiler suit he wore in prison, Otis had grabbed Luke Tomlinson, the close friend he shares with Prince William and Harry, and yelped: 'Look at us, look at the state of us.' Ferry has good looks that came direct from a model mother and a rock star father, Roxy Music singer Bryan. Even as he and his friends traipsed out of Charing Cross police station at 2am on Friday they looked more like they were stumbling from the annual rugby club dinner than men who'd endured a stretch behind bars. </p> <p>These though are rebels with a cause. And those who know them talk of a fierce, collective intellect honed towards a simple ideology: the preservation of a rural Britain and the tradition it stands for. Fox-hunting may have become their rallying call, but they are fighting to protect a Britain defined by warm beer. </p> <p>Certainly Otis was educated in the fineries of tradition. Lucy took him one misty November morning to the state opening of Parliament aged just five. Speaking to The Observer after her son was released, Lucy tellingly was aghast her son's actions had served to endanger yet another ancient ritual of Britain. </p> <p>'It would be a tragedy if those men in tights disappeared as a result, an absolute tragedy,' she said, referring to suggestions that it was time to overhaul the antiquated Parliamentary security systems. </p> <p>'Maybe we could arm them with machine guns, bring them up to date. But we cannnot destroy our historical riches. Those man make England different from, say, Spain, France, Germany. Without such heritage then cultures would just be the same.' </p> <p>The Ledbury Set, named after the corner of England including chunks of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and south Shropshire where the perpetrators of last week's stunt hail, is characterised by its cliquey-ness. Those welcomed into the small, monied south Herefordshire scene are soon embroiled in a merry-go-round of scandal, gossip and smut. </p> <p>They tend to stick by their own. One couple told how, shortly after moving into the area, they were invited to a dinner party and quickly introduced to a horsey woman clad head to foot in tweed. 'You must be the Pakistanis,' she said. 'What do you mean?' asked the newcomers. 'Anybody who hasn't lived here for 30 years is a Pakistani,' she explained. </p> <p>Members are graded by which shoot they belong and how many times they've popped over to Highgrove, the country home of Prince Charles. Bawdy behaviour and financial clout go hand in hand here. David Redvers is 34, and owns a stud in the Severn Vale near Gloucester; he was among those who gatecrashed Parliament. It is men like Redvers who have establised the Ledbury Set's reputation as a group of young, intelligent men who zealously hunt the hills close to the Welsh border. </p> <p>Others now added to that list are John Halliday, 37, who works the hounds at the Ledbury Hunt along with Robert Thame, another 30-something, who also plays polo with Prince Charles, Harry and William. Otis Ferry is believed to have become embroiled in the set after excelling as the youngest ever joint-master in UK history, in south Staffordshire. From there it is a short journey east to the bar of Ledbury's Feathers Hotel and from there again to north Wiltshire. Here Otis would meet Luke Tomlinson amid a backdrop of parties with the offspring of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire society. </p> <p>It remains unclear when breaching the Commons first became a serious proposition. Yet, increasingly it seems, the stunt cannot be dismissed as a jolly jape drawn up on the back of an envelope hours beforehand, as some of the men involved have claimed. Pro-hunt campaigners claim to have begun plotting while giving evidence during the committee stages. </p> <p>'We were in there for days, wandering about, weighing it up,' said a senior figure in the Real Countryside Alliance, the rebellious brother of the more sober Countryside Alliance. In the close-knit world of hunting it seems impossible that details of the plan failed to filter to those caught in the Commons..</p>",
  "Dana deserves a medal for her services to Irish democracy. This might sound strange coming from an ardent secularist who believes in the absolute separation of church and state and who thinks fundamentalist Catholicism has cast a withering, reactionary shadow over Irish life since, and arguably before, independence. <p>The former Eurovision Song Contest winner certainly champions all the causes from which liberals and progressives have recoiled: opposition to divorce; insistence on an outright ban on abortion; promotion of Catholic family values; rolling back of European democratic imperatives over Irish law; the special position of the church in Irish society. None the less, Dana, now Rosemary Scallon, has demonstrated more political courage and stuck closer to her principles than the two major opposition parties. </p> <p>While she has made it clear from the outset that she would contest next month's presidential election, both Fine Gael and, depressing it is to say, Labour have run away from the battlefield. The reason for their diffidence is obvious: the overwhelming popularity of Mary McAleese, the current occupant of Aras an Uachtarain.</p> <p>No one, not even her liberal detractors back in 1997, would deny that President McAleese deserves a second term. Despite our misgivings about her own conservative Catholicism and her northern nationalist background, McAleese has remained true to the spirit of her election slogan of 'Building Bridges' seven years ago. </p> <p>She reached out to many sectors of society we once feared she would be alienated from. In defiance of her own church, she took communion in Dublin's Anglican cathedral; she has studiously played down her own views on abortion, contraception and divorce, not allowing her office to be used as a vehicle to reverse the small but significant gains for personal and sexual freedom in the 1990s. </p> <p>Nor has the president used her time in office to advance a traditional nationalist polity regarding Northern Ireland. In fact, she and her husband, Martin, have established quiet but important connections with working-class loyalists, including the UDA's South Belfast brigadier, Jackie McDonald. President McAleese knows more than most public figures in the republic about the importance of bringing that community in from the cold after almost a decade of demoralisation, factional infighting and social degeneration. </p> <p>All this suggests that McAleese has earned another seven years in the presidency, yet for the first time in a long time, I find myself agreeing with the controversialist/columnist Vincent Browne - the Irish people also deserve an electoral contest in October. Browne has been correct to excoriate both Fine Gael and Labour for shirking their democratic responsibilities. </p> <p>Labour, in particular, fear that they would suffer a reverse of the 1990 Mary Robinson presidential campaign, when her victory provided the platform for the party's greatest electoral performance two years later. This time around, Pat Rabbitte and his strategists worry that a hammering in the 2004 presidential poll would paint Labour in a losers' light and thus dent their chances of inflicting major damage on Fianna Fail in the next general election. Fine Gael's calculations are somewhat similar: Enda Kenny and his inner circle fear they, too, will be seriously injured if they collide with the McAleese juggernaut. Irish presidential elections do not lead to change in economic, social, northern or foreign policy. They do, however, set the tone for a nation. Mary Robinson's triumph presaged and even hastened the liberalisation of the republic during the 1990s. Mary McAleese's entry to Aras seven years later chimed perfectly with the south's new re-engagement with the north and the need to create a fresh an all-embracing cross-border project. </p> <p>If the current president's moderation while in office could be characterised as Catholic-lite, then Dana is offering the electorate the Real Thing. Many may find Rosemary Scallon's brand of religious conservatism alarmingly dogmatic. What you have to concede, though, is that this softly spoken, neatly groomed paradigm of traditional Irish Catholicism has displayed more guts in the build-up to the presidential campaign than most of the champions of liberalism and pluralism in the Republic. By running away from the electoral struggle, they are not only abdicating their democratic responsibilities, but Labour and Fine Gael risk being perceived by the voters as a bunch of chickens. </p> <p>Pat Rabbitte, meanwhile, is scheduled to launch Labour's Northern Ireland Forum group next month in Belfast. One thing the northern delegates need to make clear to the Labour Party leader is not to run away from taking on their Sinn Fein opponents. Labour's sister party, the SDLP, are in terminal decline in large part because of an unwillingness to challenge Sinn Fein in the north on issues ranging from the hijacking of the human-rights agenda to how the latter party is financed. Unless Labour, north and south, learn from the fatal errors of the SDLP and their self-destructive embrace and promotion of their lean and hungry rivals in the latter half the Nineties, Rabbitte's party is destined to suffer a similar fate. <br><br><a href=\"mailto:henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Last week the government announced its intention to raise income tax by up to two pence in the pound, a move that the opposition parties are also having to confront. It was an important moment in British politics. At long last a truth is becoming sayable - we have to pay for the benefits we want to enjoy. <p>Some readers will be saying they recall no such announcement and that this columnist has clearly taken leave of his senses. It is true that the collective intent of the three parties was well disguised, but when Alan Johnson, the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, announced in his speech to the TUC last week that he would not be lifting the retirement age for eligibility for the state pension, the issue was sealed. </p> <p>The undeniable economic and political logic of his position is to imply an increase in income tax to pay for the consequent increase in the cost of the state pension, a logic that Adair Turner, the chairman of the government's pensions commission, will lay out in exquisite and forceful detail in the interim report on the issue he will present in mid-October. </p> <p>Johnson will have already felt the full private wrath of the Treasury, now letting it be known that Mr Turner has exceeded his brief, trying pre-emptively to draw the sting from his report. Turner, the former director-general of the CBI and general policy factotum, is not deliberately trying to be awkward. His trouble is that he is honest. From what I know of the report, it will be pitiless in its thinking, a long overdue intervention after two decades of dissimulation. </p> <p>He has been helped enormously by the parallel hard thinking of David Willetts, the Conservative's spokesman on work and pensions. He was among the first to recognise the unsustainability of Britain's current pension policy; that a country in which four-fifths of pensioners receive their pension conditional on their poverty is not only an affront but economically irrational, because there is no more effective deterrent to saving. </p> <p>His answer is to re-establish the state pension as a basic universal entitlement, to upgrade it in line with the rise in earnings and to pay for it by a combination of consolidating means-tested pensions into the state pension and raising the retirement age, deferring for perhaps a few years the moment when we will have to pay more taxes. </p> <p>To understand why tax rises are inevitable we have to return to Turner's report. It will begin by laying out what lower fertility and longer life expectancy are doing to the structure of our population. There will be progressively fewer workers producing the GDP out of which more and more pensioners will be drawing their pensions. At the moment there are nearly four workers supporting one pensioner; by 2050 there will be only two. Even if there is a remarkable increase in fertility and a surge in immigration so the population grows by a quarter to more than 80 million by 2050 - which it won't and can't - the numbers of workers supporting each pensioner would still drop to three. </p> <p>Turner is uncompromising. There are only three ways out of this conundrum for the state pension. First, we have to raise the retirement age to keep the costs under control; second, the average pension has to fall to do the same thing; third, taxes have to rise to maintain the pension's purchasing power. Mr Johnson has now ruled out the first option; the second is increasingly difficult politically. Which leaves with us with the last option. </p> <p>'Ha!' comes the retort from politicians. We can hold the line if we ask people to save more. But, as Turner says, the basic equation still doesn't change. We know the ratio of workers to pensioners is set to halve. When today's savers come to sell their bonds and shares in order to buy their pension annuities, the only buyers will be the next working generation, who will have halved in number in relation to pensioners. </p> <p>As Turner patiently explains, unless the next generation increase their savings by much more than we have, share prices and bond prices must fall - and privately funded pensions will fall in value as well. Pensions in an ageing society with a dwindling workforce is a problem that we all face and which can only be solved collectively. </p> <p>Turner will set another hare running by asking for a fair deal between the generations. What Alan Johnson is doing by declaring that today's generation can retire at 65 is to require today's workers to pay the consequent higher taxes. Those workers will almost certainly have to retire later themselves - a supreme policy of selfishness. And what's more, many of today's workers in the private sector are working to create profits to pay off the pension-fund deficits to support generous, guaranteed, so-called defined benefit pensions for yesterday's workforce. </p> <p>Many of the delegates at last week's TUC conference seemed to think this was just dandy. They thought that today's employers and employees should put their own prosperity at risk by being compelled to top up pension-fund deficits that have resulted from yesterday's pension promises being ridiculously generous, given the collapse in both share prices and interest rates. </p> <p>Pensions are paid from annuities that are invested in long-term bonds; if the returns from long-term bonds were to rise by 1 per cent from today's levels, most defined benefit pension funds would swing into surplus; if they fell by 1.5 per cent, about a third of our top companies would be technically bankrupt. </p> <p>The way out of this trap is not to lock individual companies into the swings of the capital markets and, thus, potential receivership - the self-defeating policy of the unions and, apparently, Alan Johnson. The solution is to socialise the problem through the government issuing bonds that offer sufficiently high returns to keep pension funds solvent - the policy proposed, embarrassingly for the left, by David Willetts with his 'longevity bonds'. As we are all unexpectedly living longer with unexpectedly fewer workers in a world of unexpectedly lower investment returns, his proposition is that the government should issue high- interest bonds underwritten by everyone to bail out distressed pension funds. </p> <p>All these proposals, though, involve a cost. There isn't a bag of swag in the private sector which can be raided, and there is no free lunch. There are only least bad ways out of the mess, and if we don't want to work longer or accept lower pensions, then we must pay higher taxes. </p> <p>Some of us have been saying this for longer than we care to remember. Willetts and Turner, though, are finally opening the national debate up in ways that are unanswerable. Good for them. Let us hope that this time somebody is listening.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Our Final Century </strong> </p> <p><strong> by Martin Rees</strong> </p> <p>Arrow \u00a37.99 pp228 </p> <p> Robert Frost had a fixed view about mankind's fate: </p> <p> Some say the world will end in fire, <br>Some say in ice. </p> <p>From what I've tasted of desire </p> <p>I hold with those who favour fire. </p> <p> To judge from the pages of this intriguing tome on civilisation's immediate prospects, the poet was probably on the right track. Most threats to the world look pretty fiery: nuclear war, the eruption of a supervolcano, or a collision with an asteroid. Some of these events are more likely than others, however, with the first looking a strong bet, the last a remote one. </p> <p>Certainly, flames win over ice ages and deluges any day, says Rees, the Astronomer Royal. However, it is really mankind itself that is the true threat to our planet, he stresses. Apart from stockpiling atomic weapons, humans are developing disciplines like biotechnology and nanotechnology (the science of the incredibly small) at an alarming rate, while our soaring numbers constantly erode our chances of controlling ourselves and our technology. Hence, Rees's conclusion that we have only a 50-50 chance of making it to AD2100 without destroying civilisation. </p> <p>'Humanity is more at risk than at any earlier phase in its history. Unfortunately, it is easier to conceive of effective threats than effective antidotes.' </p> <p>Of course, Rees is an aficionado of astronomical catastrophes. A cosmologist based in Cambridge, he is an expert on gamma-ray bursts: paroxysms of radiation that signal the deaths of stars and the births of black holes. It is therefore not so surprising that he is notsunny when it comes to Earth's immediate prospects. </p> <p>Such thoughts sound fairly harrowing. Yet Rees writes with clarity and pace so that it becomes impossible not to jog along with his gloomy prognostications. Armageddon may not be much a laugh but in Rees's hands, it is at least intriguing.</p>",
  "<p>'There's a long way to go yet,' said Darren Clarke, when asked after another convincing win at Oakland Hills if he were ready to light up a celebratory cigar with Europe only three points shy of retaining the Ryder Cup. Later, with the sun setting on this beautiful and treacherous course, Paul McGinley, also revelling in victory, echoed his compatriot's senti ments. </p> <p>'We have a lot of respect for the Americans. We learned our lesson at Brookline.' McGinley was recalling how the Americans recovered from a record 10-6 deficit to win the Cup on the final day in Boston in 1999. However, financially and emotionally committed witnesses unencumbered by the Irishmen's professional caution came away from yester day's absorbing golf convinced that only the arrival of a hurricane or John Wayne can save the Americans today. </p> <p>Certainly the Irish supporters celebrating McGinley and Padraig Harrington's 4&amp;3 win over Davis Love and Tiger Woods at the 15th entertained no doubts, suggesting they might have got around the course's alcohol ban. Clarke, beaten in the morning, played wonderfully in the afternoon, combining with Lee Westwood to secure a foursomes win, 5&amp;4, over Jay Haas and Chris DiMarco. </p> <p>Asked yet again by an American journalist why Europe were so good in this form of the game, Westwood made a relevant point. 'I think it helps if you are really good friends, and you don't feel so bad if you hit a poor shot.' Europe, united and smiling, lead 11-5 and have their opponents staggering. </p> <p>There are 12 points on offer in the singles today and Europe have only to reach 14 to take Sam Ryder's precious trophy home for the fourth time from the past five meetings, and seventh from the past 10. Their other task - and, to be honest, it applies to supposedly non-partisan writers too - is disguising any trace of smugness. Under the gracious leadership of Bernhard Langer, that should not be a problem. </p> <p>As for Langer's counterpart, Hal Sutton, defeat will really hurt. 'We're going to have to come out charging today, no doubt about that,' he said. Sutton is a committed if odd captain and he blundered in a couple of selections, notably pairing those implacable rivals, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, on day one. Twice. For two losses. </p> <p>He split them yesterday and each won a match. Westwood's words must be ringing in Big Hal's ears. A stuttering American fightback after a dismal Friday inspired the belief among their voluble fans that miracles do happen. They do. But not often. There will be no parting of the seas today, no hurricane. There will be no cavalry charge over the hill, just sunshine and tears of joy and sadness, as ever. </p> <p>The Europeans thoroughly deserve their success here, as they deserved victory two years ago at The Belfry. The Americans, so dominant from the tournament's inception in 1927 until Jack Nicklaus suggested 50 years later that Britain and Ireland bring on board the talent from the continent (most specifically Seve Ballesteros), are slipping. </p> <p>Someone even suggested, not so facetiously, that perhaps the United States would benefit from co-opting players from Mexico and Canada. It cannot be easy for the Americans to accept their lingering status as losers - and it is very pleasant for their conquerors. Part of the difficulty for the hosts is getting their brilliant individuals to gel as a team. </p> <p>Europe have no such problems. As Langer put it, maybe that is because his players do not turn up 'in limousines and helicopters'. </p> <p>The Americans started the day five points down but, at one point, looked like winning all four fourballs in the morning. Europe battled to take one-and-a-half points. After lunch, Europe came back strongly in the foursomes and won three out of four. </p> <p>'Right now, we are fighting to keep our heads above water,' Mickelson admitted. He could not have sounded more like a drowning man if he were talking from the bottom of the ocean.</p>",
  "<p>The City is bracing itself for a 'grim' set of trading figures from Marks &amp; Spencer, the beleaguered retailer, on the eve of a \u00a32.3 billion handout to shareholders.</p> <p>The news will be in stark contrast to Tesco, which is expected to unveil record half-year profits this week. </p> <p>The M&amp;S board, under chairman Paul Myners and chief executive Stuart Rose - who saw off a \u00a312 billion takeover bid from BHS boss Philip Green in the summer - meets with advisers tomorrow to decide the final pricing of the handout to sharehold ers.

'The trends were set under the old regime, and they both know the real test will come with next year's trading,' said a source. </p> <p>Tesco will this week unveil the highest profits it has ever recorded in a six-month period. </p> <p>Lehman Brothers is forecasting that profits will increase by 20 per cent to \u00a3790m and that like-for-like sales will surge 7.2 per cent year on year, compared with 6.3 per cent at the same time in 2003.</p> <p>Analysts say Tesco's performance is all the more remarkable as last year's numbers were boosted by the sweltering summer which saw abnormally high sales of soft drinks, ice creams and barbecues.

Maybe Sky News sent Rachel Amatt because she is a good reporter, who happened to be staffing the Moscow bureau at the time. </p> <p>Maybe Channel 4 News sent me because I have some experience in covering wars, sieges and disasters, and I had a Russian visa.

They meet when Casim comes to Roisin's school to pick up his bright young sister Tahara, who has created a bit of a stir by declaring during a class debate that she's 'a Glaswegian Pakistani woman teenager who supports Glasgow Rangers in a Catholic school', a statement for which she's pursued by other kids. She seeks refuge in the music room. For Roisin and Casim it's almost love at first sight. Loach is something of a left-wing puritan and usually his heroines bestow their sexual favours on the hero only after he's performed some brave political action. Here early on there's spontaneous, consensual sex and fairly explicit scenes of passion and erotic power transcending social and ethnic barriers. </p> <p>But Casim, a seemingly liberated man, takes ages to reveal to the emancipated Roisin that his parents have arranged a bride for him. Meanwhile, Roisin can get a permanent post at her school only if her parish priest will sign a certificate of approval. The priest refuses, telling her she's living in sin and should go and teach the Protestants. Much mutual recrimination takes place, they move in together, break up again and pressure is put on both. The movie is unusually broad for Loach and overly contrived. Casim's father, for instance, is not merely a despised immigrant, but at the age of eight his twin brother was murdered during Partition. When her headmaster comes in to tell Roisin the school cannot keep her on for moral reasons, she's teaching a class in which Billie Holiday's 'Strange Fruit' is being accompanied by a montage of slides showing lynchings in the Deep South. Fortunately the acting in general, and that of Yaqub and Birthistle in particular, has a naturalness and conviction that transcends the clumsy script, though there is no Mercutio figure around to shout, 'a plague on both your houses'. The material is not unfamiliar of course, and My Son the Fanatic and East is East are both tougher and more challenging. Ae Fond Kiss has what secular liberals (not the sort of people Loach sets out to please) will regard as a happy ending. </p> <p>The week's other British films are deeply disappointing. The versatile, usually impressive Michael Winterbottom's <strong> Code 46</strong> is an addled dystopian sci-fi film in which present-day Dubai and Shanghai are shot to look like a polluted hi-tech future where the world is either desert or high-rise city and you need special 'papelles' (combination of insurance policy and visa) to travel anywhere. Smug detective William (Tim Robbins), high on 'intuition virus', comes from Seattle to investigate fraud in Shanghai and falls for larcenous, waif-like clerk Maria Gonzalez (Samantha Morton). Tedious, nearly incomprehensible, it tries to run the gamut from Alphaville to Zardoz. </p> <p>Marc Evans has followed his enjoyable debut My Little Eye with the tiresome <strong> Trauma</strong>, a psychological horror story shot on the Isle of Man and in the East End of London. Colin Firth, survivor of a car crash, believes himself to be a grieving widower and a murder suspect and most of what we see is taking place in his deluded head. It's been much better done recently in A Beautiful Mind and Cronenberg's Spider.Send Firth a get-well-soon card and avoid the film. </p> <p>Nimr\u00f3d Antal's accomplished feature debut, <strong> Kontroll</strong>, is a black comedy set entirely in Budapest's underground railway where teams of unkempt drop-outs, misfits and losers work as ticket inspectors with only an armband to establish their authority. It has a big cast, little plot and is some sort of image of post-communist Eastern Europe. </p> <p>Starring its writer-director, Marina De Van, <strong> In My Skin</strong> ( Dans ma peau ) is a disturbing film about an ambitious Parisian business analyst who sustains nasty cuts to her leg after falling in her boss's garden at a party. Troubled at work, having problems with her boyfriend and estranged from her chief female chum, she proceeds from caressing her wounds to inflicting horrendous new ones and then on to a form of self-cannibalism. It's a form of body-horror picture, of more interest to clinicians than to ordinary moviegoers. </p> <p><strong> Amarcord</strong>, the best of Fellini's later films, and <strong> The Shawshank Redemption</strong>, one of Hollywood's finest 'big house' pictures, are back in the cinema and very welcome.</p> <p><strong>Top five films</strong></p> <p><strong>Ae Fond Kiss </strong> (15) Ken Loach remains on Clydeside to challenge racial prejudice and religious bigotry. </p> <p><strong>Collateral (15) </strong>Tom Cruise at his most unlovable is driven down LA's mean streets in Michael Mann's masterly thriller.</p> <p><strong>Open Water </strong> (15) Low-budget 'swimming with sharks' thriller that makes Jaws look like a Steven Spielberg movie.</p> <p><strong>The Motorcycle Diaries </strong> (15) Che Guevara's gap year touring Latin America between his medical studies and his revolutionary vocation.</p> <p><strong>Super Size Me</strong> (12A) Morgan Spurlock's investigation of the fast-food business is funny, abrasive and adversely therapeutic.</p>",
  "<p>The Northlake subdivision of Georgetown, some 45 minutes north of Austin, Texas, is as quiet as quiet can be. These few wide streets, named after native American tribes, are roads to nowhere; a driver has no business here unless he is a resident or a visitor. The houses - low-slung, wooden affairs with porches and swings and basketball hoops - are set back from the road and languish in several acres. Out front, on expansive drives and behind picket fences, you see the usual shiny SUVs (Chevys so big, you could live in them) but only rarely their owners, especially on weekdays. Most people here commute into Austin every morning, where they have jobs in the hi-tech industries that have brought the city fresh affluence. A dog barks. Crickets whirr. Otherwise, the only sound to be heard is that of the raspy Texas wind blowing through the long grass. </p> <p>Until last month, number 224, Navajo Trail was home to the Cooke family. They had their dream house built almost two decades ago, to their own specifications, and loved it for its tranquillity and spaciousness. Robert, like his neighbours, is a commuter; he is a software engineer for IBM. Janet teaches English at a nearby high school. Northlake, they decided, was a good place in which to bring up their two daughters, Rachel and JoAnn. Robert comes from a big, close-knit Texas family, and Navajo Trail was soon the holiday destination of choice for his relatives. On Labour Day and at Thanksgiving, the clan would celebrate with a big barbecue in the Cookes' very own three acres. 'It was wonderful,' says Robert's sister, Elaine Hettenhausen, as we drive by the house. 'It was in the countryside, a real low crime area, and the girls had their own bedrooms.' She slows down the car. 'See the fence? Janet built that herself, the traditional way.' </p> <p>But this idyll came to a dramatic end on Thursday, 10 January 2002, a day which began - as all the worst days do - like any other. As usual, Robert and Janet both left early for work, and their younger daughter, JoAnn, went off to high school. Only their elder daughter, Rachel, stayed behind at home. Rachel, 19, was a freshman student at Mesa Junior College in San Diego, and had been home for the holidays. Her plan now was to attend her cousin's wedding on 12 January, and then head back to California to join her boyfriend of several months, Greg. When the family left her, she was asleep on the living room sofa. Her father, a big man with haunted eyes, remembers that she complained a little at being woken up by all the human traffic. Like all students everywhere, she wanted to lie in, to enjoy her last days of freedom. 'She wanted to be a fashion designer,' he says, with a smile. In some ways, it wasn't like her to want to sleep: 'Rachel was one of those people for whom there are never enough hours in the day.' </p> <p>That Thursday, Robert did not hear from his daughter, which was strange - she always found some excuse to call - and when he arrived home, a little before five, she was not there. Still, he was not unduly worried. He knew that she had planned to go out with a girlfriend that evening; perhaps Shannon had already come by, picked her up. Later, though, he called Shannon. It turned out that she had not heard from Rachel at all. More calls were made. Robert rang Wildfire, a chi-chi local restaurant where Rachel sometimes worked for pocket money, and was relieved to hear that, yes, Rachel had done a shift that evening. It wasn't until the following morning, when there was still no sign of their daughter, that he found out from the night shift manager that he had been misinformed. The Rachel in question was not his child. He now knew something was terribly wrong. </p> <p>'At this point, Janet went to the hospital to see if any unidentified females had come in,' says Robert. 'And I drove Rachel's jogging route because, by this time, we had figured out that the only things that were missing were her running clothes.' At two o'clock, he and Janet met at the sheriff's office where they turned in a missing persons' report. Rachel, an accomplished cross-country runner, ran four miles every day, taking her regular route around the quiet roads of the Northlake subdivision. This particular day, her family believe, she must have left the house mid-morning; they know she spoke to Greg on the telephone at 9.15am. She was wearing a green vest, grey shorts and Asics trainers. In her hand was a yellow Walkman. Around 11am, she ran past a neigh bour's drive; he recalls seeing Rachel as he backed up his car. After this, there are no more reported sightings. Robert and Janet Cooke's beloved daughter had simply disappeared into thin air. And so, the searching began. The sheriff's search, beefed up with the help of hundreds of volunteers, lasted only until Monday. After that, the Cookes brought in Texas EquuSearch, a mounted search and recovery team run by Tim Miller, whose daughter Laura was abducted and murdered in 1984. Miller's search lasted two weeks. </p> <p>'After that, I continued to run searches on weekends,' says Robert. 'We carried on for nine months. But at some point, we thought: we've done our best. If they took her 12 miles, there's no rea son why they shouldn't have taken her 15 miles. We could search the whole of Texas and still not find her.' Cooke relates all of this in the carefully neutral tone of one who has told the same story, over and over, and has learned to drain it of emotion. It is a hot day, and we are sitting by an Austin lake. Behind him, women his daughter's age are swimming. Every now and then, one of them will pull themselves out of the water and head off down the wooded paths at the side of the lake. In spite of the sunshine, and the crowds, I suddenly find that it is all I can do not to call after these lovely girls. 'Be careful,' I want to shout. 'Please don't go that way alone.' </p> <p>For me, this story begins in vanity (my own) and ends in humility (also my own). I stumbled across the story of Rachel Cooke's disappearance two months ago, on the internet. A couple of friends had come over to my house for dinner and we got to talking about Googling. They informed me that, these days, people not only use the world's best search engine to vet prospective dates; they use it to follow their own progress in life, too. Apparently, an acquaintance of ours has even published a novel about this. I spent the evening teasing my friends about their extreme narcissism but, naturally, no sooner had they hopped into their respective taxis than I ran upstairs and Googled myself. The first site that came up was the one set up by Robert Cooke to help return Rachel to her family. </p> <p>The site was so striking, and Rachel's story so troubling, that I never got beyond it. Soon after, I contacted Robert (for obvious reasons, I used my sister's email address rather than my own) and asked him if I might write about what had happened to his family. His reply was swift. On the first anniversary of the disappearance of his daughter, he told me, he had made her a vow: 'I promised her that I would find her, and I intend to do it. I don't want to let her be forgotten.' </p> <p>In the two years and nine months since he last saw Rachel, her father has learned - somewhat against his quiet nature - to be an extrovert, to talk to anyone who is willing to listen. He has become schooled in the way of sound bites, and adept at capturing the quicksilver interest of a fickle media. 'We are willing to do anything that can help bring Rachel back to us,' he told me. 'So I would love for you to write a piece about her.' Three weeks later, I flew to Austin to meet him. </p> <p>Even if I hadn't known of his loss, I might still have sensed that Cooke carries with him some unspeakable burden. He walks gingerly, in the manner of one who fears what may be around the next corner, and his face is a soft planet of shadows, those beneath his eyes being the darkest and most heart-breaking. He tells me that he is able to sleep, but I am not sure I believe him. I imagine, also, that he does not take the best care of himself, that he is a comfort eater (although, in this context, that expression seems horribly insulting). When I visited his house - he and Janet have now divorced, and he has finally moved out of Navajo Trail - it was still crammed with packing boxes. On a coffee table, however, he had placed the bare essentials: his mobile phone and laptop computer, from which he cannot be parted, and a big, exuberant tub of red liquorice. </p> <p>Since the searching stopped, Cooke has focused his attention on keeping his daughter's story in the media. He and other members of the family have appeared on television - notably on America's Most Wanted , a Fox show presented by John Walsh, whose son Adam was abducted and murdered in 1981 - and made the difficult decision to turn the anniversary of Rachel's disappearance into a media event, to be picked up by the local television news. Candlelit services, balloon releases, the sending out of white doves into the sky: sometimes, it is tough coming up with new ideas. The family also produces car bumper stickers and badges asking for help in finding Rachel, and a website, rachelcookesearch.org, where you can read her father's daily journal. Finally, the family has established the Rachel Alert Network, a charitable organisation which aims to prevent abductions through education and self-defence training, and which provides support and information to the friends and families of the missing. RAN recently published a fundraising cookbook, Recipes to Remember, which includes Robert's way with egg rolls and a dish called shrimp confetti from Janet. </p> <p>All of these activities help to keep Robert going, but, at bottom, he is sustained, even after all this time, by hope - however worn, however wizened. </p> <p>'I know someone took Rachel,' he says. 'I don't know exactly where they took her, or what they did with her, but I know she's probably not alive. I know that. We faced that a long time ago. There's a slim chance that she might be alive, that she hit her head and has amnesia, she's somewhere else, living as another person. But the chances are so slim. You don't want to get your hopes up. You have to be ready for that phone call. Any time they find unidentified human remains... it's really bad. One last year was found only nine miles from our house. That was the worst one.' </p> <p>Would a body give him some kind of relief? 'There's no answer. Part of me wants to find her no matter what. Another part hopes she is alive.' But he is growing painfully used to waiting for the results of DNA tests to come in; since Rachel disappeared, eight bodies have been found in or around his Williamson County home. </p> <p>America has a terrible missing persons problem. You might even call it a crisis. According to the FBI's National Crime Information Centre, there were 840,279 missing person entries in 2001 of which, horrifyingly, 85-95 per cent were juveniles. (In the UK, 200,000 people are reported missing every year, although the two figures are not properly comparable because they are compiled in different ways.) And this figure includes only those who have someone who cares enough to notice that they are gone; the reality could be far worse. But were you unaware of these numbers, the situation would still be impossible to ignore, even for the casual visitor. I do not visit America often but I was in the country when Chandra Levy, 24, a former federal intern, went missing (her disappearance in 2001 was widely reported thanks to her relationship with a congressman; her remains were found a year later in a Washington park). I was there, too, last year, when 27-year-old Laci Peterson disappeared in California (her husband, Scott, is now standing trial for her murder and that of her unborn child). And only last week, I saw the 'amber alert' signs on a Texas freeway asking drivers to look out for 12-year-old Jami Hicks from Mesquite, who had been abducted by her violent stepfather. (Jami is now safe and well.) </p> <p>Whether or not America's missing are ever found depends, to a frightening degree, on where they were living when they disappeared. There is no single clearing house for missing people in America, and not every law enforcement agency is connected to the relevant FBI computer - so even when remains are found, it may prove impossible to discover if they are those of a person registered as lost. Law enforcement in America is infuriatingly fractured. 'Every individual law enforcement agency has their own database,' says Robert Cooke. 'Each country within a state has several different law enforcement agencies; Texas alone has some 250 counties. Texas has a DNA database, and it can talk to the FBI database, but not every state has one and even if they do, it may not talk directly to the others. So someone may be found just 10 feet over a state line, and they may not be recognised.' His daughter's case was handled by the Williamson County Sheriff's department. 'It's a real small force: just the sheriff and a couple of deputies, and no specialists in cold case work.' </p> <p>When an adult goes missing, even a young adult, it can be hard to get the attention of the police. In America, the law has recently been changed so that anyone missing who is under the age of 18 now counts as a juvenile, and is therefore a priority; unfortunately for the Cookes, however, Rachel was 19. 'I'm currently working with the National Centre for Missing Adults on a training course for law enforcement agencies. I want them to look at each case individually, not just to go with the statistic that most adults leave on their own. If someone has a mistress or a lover, they may have gone of their own volition. But if such an action was against a person's nature, the police need to take their disappearance seriously right from the very start. It took us a while to convince them that she hadn't gone off on her own. The first deputy kept saying that she'd run off to Mexico with her boyfriend.' </p> <p>Robert advises relatives that it is important to act fast, even if the missing person is an adult. 'We thought there was a 24-hour waiting period before a missing persons report could be filed. Turns out that's a myth.' He also urges family members to try to rule themselves out as suspects as early as possible. 'I hired an ex-FBI profiler and he told me to request a polygraph test. It's an awful thing, but the family are always suspects. Polygraphs are not admissible in court, but if you volunteer, it can help move their attention on.' Finally, he thinks the more publicity a case gets, the better - though this is often easier said than done. 'They want blond, blue-eyed females. In the eyes of the media, there are strikes against you. If you're low income, male, belong to a minority or from a broken home, they won't touch you. The problem with Rachel was that she was just that little bit too old.' </p> <p>All of this stuff - so humdrum and yet so desperate - is very far from the way missing persons investigations are represented in the gritty-but-glamorous CBS television series, Without a Trace . </p> <p>The devastating effect that losing someone this way has on a family can not be overstated, and I struggle to find the right words to describe it. The Cookes now find themselves in a kind of mortal aspic, unable to move forwards, unable to go backwards, their lives on hold, their loss ever present, always running on an exhausting loop inside their heads. Robert regards himself as 'disabled', unable to function properly as a human being. </p> <p>'In some ways, it's harder now. A lot of the people who helped us have gone back to their normal lives, and we're still stuck with the nightmare.' </p> <p>Was his marriage a casualty? 'If you have a really good marriage going into something like this, you might be able to survive it. But if your marriage is at all shaky, it's just the last straw.' His heart clenches when he thinks of his surviving daughter JoAnn. Once, she called him late at night to say she had a puncture. As he drove to pick her up, he was beside himself with fear. </p> <p>Meanwhile, his ex-wife Janet has twice been admitted to psychiatric hospitals, where she was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. 'I still see my shrink,' she says. 'And there are days when I don't want to get up, when I just want to stay in bed, when it hits me all over again. What keeps me going is that I need to be there for when she comes back. I prefer to keep on hoping even if I have to do that for another 20 years because Rachel was so precious to us. We brought her up right. This shouldn't have happened to her.' </p> <p>Even so, these days her hope is self-conscious, willed, rather than instinctive. 'She would have found a way back to us if she was still alive. I know it. The Navajos have a saying that a person's spirit lives on so long as somebody remembers them. Well, we have a lot of good memories.' </p> <p>Since Rachel disappeared, her younger sister has graduated from high school and is now a student at the University of Texas. Her parents are proud of the way she has coped but, clearly, it has not been easy. </p> <p>'Rachel was my best friend,' she says. 'We had the same mannerisms, the same sense of humour.' She tells me that she has not been able to develop many close friendships at university, and when people ask her if she has any siblings, she is uncertain what her response should be. She dreams about Rachel often. 'They're always very happy dreams. I say to my mom, \"See, I told you she wasn't gone!\" Then I wake up, and I have that same sense of loss all over again.' Rachel's boyfriend, Greg, a carpenter and musician, has not been on a date since he lost her. 'I can't find her in other girls, so I don't give them a second chance. I think about her all the time.' </p> <p>Over a Tex-Mex lunch, Rachel's aunt, Elaine, told me how she fears for her brother, who indulges in so much displacement activity, and worries about her niece, who is sometimes very quiet. Rachel's grandparents, she says, aged suddenly and dramatically after she disappeared, and seemed to lose both their innocence and, in the case of her mother, her religious faith, too. The family had already gathered for the wedding of Rachel's cousin when they finally discovered that she was missing, and Elaine will never forget the sight of her father standing outside her hotel room having taken a telephone call from Robert. His face was blank with disbelief. The wedding went ahead, without Robert, Janet and JoAnn, but she still does not know, quite, how they got through it. Rachel's uncle, a pastor, conducted the service. She shakes her head. </p> <p>By the lake in Austin, I ask Robert Cooke to tell me about his daughter. This is the only time in our conversation that his emotions get the better of him. He takes a deep breath, a sigh of both trepidation and longing, and then the words begin to spill out. </p> <p>'She was very outgoing. She used to sing all the time. She was a good worker. She lived life for the moment. She was a daredevil. She loved rollercoasters. As a little girl, she would always be standing on her tippy toes, trying to look taller. I never go for more than an hour without thinking of her, and sometimes I can't even go more than five minutes. It's a shame... It's a shame. That some low-life animal took her away, when she could have given the world so much.' </p> <p><strong>Lost and found in America...</strong></p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> In March 2003, 15-year-old Elizabeth Smart, who had been abducted from Salt Lake City nine months earlier and was presumed dead, was rescued from a religious fanatic who forced her to wear a wig and veil. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong>Scott Peterson told police that his wife Laci, a substitute teacher, vanished from their Modesto home on Christmas Eve 2002 when he was out fishing in San Francisco Bay, 90 miles from their home. Four months later her body was washed up close to the spot he had named. He currently stands trial accused of murdering her to be with his mistress. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong>Washington intern 24-year-old Chandra Levy disappeared in May 2001 after revelations she had been having an affair with Democrat congressman Gary Conduit, which also lost him the congressional elections in California. Her body was found in a park a year later. A year of forensic tests failed to establish cause of death.</p>",
  "<p>Three red cards, a last-gasp equaliser from Nwankwo Kanu, defender Darren Purse branded a coward by the opposition manager, a missed penalty from debutant Robert Earnshaw and comic Frank Skinner publicly adding his voice to the support for manager Gary Megson in his simmering dispute with chairman Jeremy Peace. If West Bromwich Albion are to make another hasty return to the Football League, they do not look likely to do so quietly. </p> <p>Kanu's late, headed equaliser was the final noteworthy action of a pulsating game given an edge of menace, so claimed Fulham, after Purse escaped with only a caution following a bad 27th-minute challenge on Papa Bouba Diop. </p> <p>'I thought it was a coward's challenge. I thought it was a leg-breaker,' said the Fulham manager, Chris Coleman. 'I was a centre-half myself and I was never shy in the tackle, but I never tried to break anybody's leg, either. That all started the bad feeling.' </p> <p>If referee Mike Dean was slow to locate his red card on that occasion, he had no such difficulties in the final half-hour when - rightly, it has to be said - he dismissed first Diop then Neil Clement and Andy Cole, the scorer of Fulham's 72rd-minute opener. </p> <p>Diop's revenge for the earlier tussle with Purse saw the midfielder blatantly slap his opponent across the face. In mitigation, Fulham claim Purse had stamped on the player's foot, a defence similar to the one offered by Cole after his own dismissal. </p> <p>He was sent off four minutes from time for assaulting Clement, swinging an ugly haymaker after the Albion midfielder had brought down Luis Boa Morte on the breakaway, a professional foul that also resulted in a red card. </p> <p>Fulham had gone in front when Cole exchanged passes with Adam Green to score at the near post. It wiped out the memory of a first half in which Albion were on top, Kanu hitting the post and Earnshaw producing an appalling penalty miss. </p> <p>Moritz Volz was punished for handling Earnshaw's header and, mindful of Arsenal bullying the referee into overturning a penalty award of their own last week, Fulham attempted to follow suit, with qualified success. After a three-minute delay, the decision stood, but Earnshaw's woeful attempt cleared the bar by yards. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Kanu - fabulous all-rounder. </p> <p>HREF=\"mailto: You can mail the Observer direct at\"<a sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Kevin Keegan apparently skates on the thinnest of ice at Manchester City, Gary Megson is at odds with the West Bromwich Albion chairman and both managers could depart their clubs in the next few days. For their batty, beleaguered kind, this has been the most precarious start to a season in the history of the Premiership; an unlucky 13 seasons for some 'supremos'. </p> <p>Already Paul Sturrock has gone from Southampton and Sir Bobby Robson from Newcastle, the latter to be replaced by Graeme Souness from Blackburn, where Mark Hughes has taken over. The word is that should Keegan go, Bolton's Sam Allardyce will be invited to replace him, while Sir Bobby could resurface at Albion. It is not so much a merry-go-round as a queue for the human cannonball. </p> <p>Managers have always got the sack or left for better jobs. Since the Premiership's inception, there had been 85 managerial changes up until the start of this campaign, which represents an average of seven a season. The total number of changes in English football's top four divisions last year was 46 - exactly half of the clubs. </p> <p>It is an astonishing number, the more so in the light of research a couple of years ago that showed that the results of a club changing manager improve for an average of eight games before frequently returning to their norm. Every club is looking to be the exception, however. </p> <p>What has been different this season has been the swiftness - a euphemism for panic, perhaps - with which clubs have acted. Before this season, only five of the 85 Premiership changes were made before the end of August and none for the past four years. Sturrock and Sir Bobby were gone after two and four league games respectively. </p> <p>It is happening at all levels, too. Mark Wright departed Chester in August, though seemingly as a result of internal club disputes, and Craig Brown has gone from Preston. In the Conference, Forest Green's seven straight defeats have seen the back of Tim Harris while Peter Nicholas, the former Crystal Palace and Wales player, was sacked from Newport County, having failed to live up to pre-season expectation. </p> <p>That, indeed, is the downfall of many a hapless manager whose chairman and board believe they should be better than they are, no matter how much better the opposition have become. Patience in football now seems to be a vice. </p> <p>As Paul Sturrock outlines in a fascinating interview for <em>The Observer</em>, his problem may well have been in not understanding quickly enough the psyche of a Premiership player compared to those in the Football League. It does not augur well for any manager seeking to step up, with other Premiership clubs even less likely now to recruit from below. </p> <p>Rather than simply sacking, however, would it not have made some sense for the Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe to talk over any problems with Sturrock to see if there might be some resolution? Sturrock might then have learned the lessons in the job rather than out of it and gone on to become a good Premiership manager. </p> <p>It is depressing, though the reality of the modern game is that if a manager 'loses' a dressing room, he now seems to be out, such is the power wielded by players on long, expensive contracts who are more difficult to ease out. Keegan is rumoured to have lost City's collection of underperforming big-earners; Robson unable to keep in check some immature talents at St James' Park. </p> <p>It can make you angry. Keegan, Sir Bobby - and add to the list G\u00e9rard Houllier - have made one serious mistake, it seems. They are enlightened empowerers of players, men who admire and even like top-quality performers - rarer than might be imagined among managers. They cut players too much slack, treated them like adult professionals and were rewarded by a lack of dedication from certain of them. </p> <p>Naturally, the antidote in Newcastle's case is Souness, supposedly a tough disciplinarian. We will see how, after the honeymoon, the players respond. Watching his arrival, incidentally, reminded you of the truism that managers arrive as they depart: fired with enthusiasm. </p> <p>In all this, chairmen seem to be a bit like newspaper editors in knowing what they want. And what they want is what another club, or paper, has. Some boards want a stickler, some want a soother. And it never ceases to surprise me that they do not do their homework properly before making the appointment that is most crucial in any club. Did Lowe not know what he was getting with Sturrock? </p> <p>Now a new trend is developing. Souness, like Hughes, has a two-year contract with a year rolling. In other words, if a board is unhappy with him after a mere two seasons, they only have to negotiate a year's pay-off to get rid of him. </p> <p>It used to be that wise leaders adopted an almost predictable pattern in football: the first year to assess and modify the playing squad, the second improving it the way the manager wants, the third to challenge for honours. Then a fourth and fifth to hone and enjoy the ripening of a team. </p> <p>What happened to leaders backing their judgment of the game and keeping their nerve and their heads when all about - notably the mob who bray on phone-ins and websites - were losing theirs? I am with the boards at Birmingham and Crystal Palace in securing Steve Bruce and Iain Dowie on long-term contracts. </p> <p>That way, a manager feels secure and surely managers operate best in secure, rather than insecure, environments. Besides, Bruce and Dowie are likely always to be in demand during the terms of those contracts. It makes sound business sense to have a talented manager tied down so that the club is due some serious compensation should he be enticed away with the agreement of all parties. </p> <p>It seems to be old-fashioned now to point out the virtues of sticking with a manager - if he wants to stay, that is. Crewe have overachieved for a decade under Dario Gradi, Charlton under Alan Curbishley. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson are not exactly fly-by-nights. But then Fergie has lost the plot, has been losing it for a few seasons now, as the FA Cup last season and the signings of Rio Ferdinand, Cristiano Ronaldo, Alan Smith and Wayne Rooney show. </p> <p>A forlorn hope, I suppose, that the sacking season has merely arrived, and ended, early. And that the lessons of the longest-serving are heeded, realism thus returning to a sometimes shabby game. Probably. Two down, five to go in the Premiership, five down and 41 to go overall.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>"
