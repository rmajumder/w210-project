  "The rising sun is burning off the early morning mist, revealing the lush, green, mountainous border terrain. As I write, the south Armagh landscape is slowly slipping past while the Enterprise train picks up speed again en route to Dublin. Some of the hillsides and mountains appear like semi-shaved heads, with vast tracts of woodland and vegetation clipped away to allow cattle and sheep to graze. <p>To my right, you can make out one of the hilltop fortresses that give the British army a commanding view of what was once their most dangerous frontier region. There are traces of times past when even the main road south was like passing into a war zone with only the CCTV cameras at the Kileen crossing point a reminder that this was once a near permanent military checkpoint and the target of republican sorties. </p> <p>It is all slowly but surely turning back into a normal, picturesque mountainous corner of Ireland - too slowly for the majority living there, too quickly for a declining minority who looked up towards the peaks and were somehow reassured at the presence of those spy posts perched on the high ground of south Armagh. </p> <p>As with the pronunciation of the letter 'H', the name of a certain city in the north-west and even the nomenclature for the State itself, there is discord over how to describe the de-escalation of the military presence in Northern Ireland. Republicans prefer the term 'demilitarisation', probably because it implies some form of retreat by the British armed forces. British ministers prefer the phrase 'normalisation', in all likelihood because it points towards a society similar to any other region of the UK free from any vestige of overt military occupation. </p> <p>Somewhere in the middle of these two lies the unionist interpretation of this process, coloured as ever, when it comes to change, with fear and suspicion. </p> <p>Whichever phrase you choose, one thing is certain: movement towards scaling down the British armed forces' presence in Northern Ireland is inexorable as the terrorist threat wanes; the status quo is no longer an option. </p> <p>That is certainly the view of senior British officers serving in the Province. Over lunch in central Belfast last Tuesday, one army officer made it crystal clear that the reduction of troops and the dismantling of the military apparatus would continue regardless of what may emerge at Leeds Castle, Kent, next weekend. He insisted that whatever the outcome, even if the Ulster parties, as is highly likely, fail to reach a deal to restore devolution, the demilitarisation/normalisation process would go on. </p> <p>The most fascinating aspect of our lunchtime conversation was the officer's exasperation over the attitude of unionist politicians towards this process. 'Surely everyone would welcome steps to normalise life in Northern Ireland, especially the unionists,' he kept repeating in a bewildered tone. </p> <p>He has a point because, for more than a quarter of a century, republicans sought to portray Northern Ireland as abnormal and, therefore, an unviable statelet. The IRA's political leaders and their allies often highlighted the existence of a massive and intrusive military presence as physical evidence that the state was not and could never be a normal entity/society. </p> <p>Now that the Provos' 'war' is over, suddenly it is the unionists who are demanding that all those 'abnormal' aspects of militarism - the watchtowers, the spy posts, the permanent vehicle checkpoints - be retained. </p> <p>For decades, it was the unionists who drew comfort from Margaret Thatcher's tenuous assertion that Northern Ireland was as British as Finchley. Now it is the unionists who appear to want 'war-zone Northern Ireland' to be maintained, while republicans steal the glory for helping to transform the State they once tried to destroy into being as near to 'normal' as Thatcher's former constituency. </p> <p>There are 12,000 British servicemen and women under the command of the GOC in Northern Ireland. The normal peacetime garrison is around 5,000 troops. For uncompromising republicans, that would be 5,000 too many but why is it that for unionists it would not be enough? </p> <p>Ask yourself where, barring Ardoyne on the Twelfth, there was a major military deployment anywhere in urban Northern Ireland and the answer is the leafy, prosperous and solidly unionist North Down during the UVF-LVF feud earlier this year. In fact, the last three major military deployments since the start of the century - the Shankill 2000, Holy Cross 2001, North Down 2004 - have all involved the security forces squaring up to loyalist terrorists and their supporters. </p> <p>'Stable' and 'normal' were never adjectives republicans wanted to see used to describe Northern Ireland. So why are unionists running away from them now, at the very moment in history when it is possible to lay to rest the tradition of physical-force republicanism and thus secure a society no longer under violent, existential threat? The paradox couldn't be greater. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk </a><br><br></p> <p>Due to a production error Henry McDonald's column <a href=\"http://observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1302922,00.html\">The death of football</a> did not appear online last week.

  "<p>The next few days will be uncomfortable ones for scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico. They are about to spend the week on their hands and knees scrabbling over the Utah desert. </p> <p>Their goal is simple: they are seeking intact fragments of cargo from the $150-million Genesis spacecraft that plunged out of the sky last week and buried itself in a large sandy crater outside Salt Lake City. </p> <p>It was an ignominious end to a mission that had promised so much. For two years, Genesis - carrying suntraps made of wafers of gold, diamond and sapphire - had been hovering a million miles from Earth, gathering billions of atoms of primordial material as they streamed from the sun. This payload was to be used by scientists to gain key insights into the formation of the sun and the planets - our own world included. </p> <p>It was not to be. A parachute failed and Genesis, filled with its precious particles, hit the Utah desert, as dismayed scientists looked on. </p> <p>'There was a big pit in my stomach. This just wasn't supposed to happen,' Roger Wiens, Genesis's flight payload chief, said yesterday. 'On the other hand, we are still hopeful. We can see that some of the solar wind wafers still look intact.' </p> <p>It remains to be seen if these fragments are too contaminated to provide useful data. Most scientists remain gloomy. Indeed, it was noticeable that before the Utah sands had even settled over Genesis's wreckage, scientists were calling for a replacement mission. </p> <p>Such hopes may be naive, but they also reveal an intensity of commitment, not just for space science in general, but for solar research in particular. And this is a crucial point: Genesis was no one-off probe to the sun, but was one of a flotilla of spacecraft and ground-based missions that have recently transformed our knowledge of our nearest star. </p> <p>'This is the golden age of solar science,' said Professor Eric Priest, of St Andrews University. 'Losing Genesis was a blow, but there is so much more we are learning about the sun - and it is going to have a profound impact on all our lives.' </p> <p>In mines deep below the ground, scientists have created lakes of detergents which they use to trap phantom-like particles called neutrinos emitted by the sun; in orbit, satellites like Soho (the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) monitor magnetic sun storms big enough to swallow the Earth; and on mountain peaks in Hawaii and Chile, astronomers are studying the sun in unprecedented detail. </p> <p>And after all, no other object in the universe, outside our own planet, is more important to our well-being. The sun's emissions drive our weather and climate. It is our closest connection to the basic forces that control the universe. And of course, without the sun's warming rays, life would be impossible. Virtually every source of energy we possess - with the exception of nuclear power - is derived from solar radiation. Coal and oil are by-products of plants and animals that once thrived in ancient sunlight. </p> <p>Yet we now know the light that provided this precious sustenance has taken a very long time to reach us. The sunbeams that shine on us today began their journey before the last ice age and needed hundreds of thousands of years to push their way through the maelstrom of activity below the sun's surface. </p> <p>'It is incredibly hot and dense down there,' said Professor Richard Harrison, of the Rutherford Laboratory. 'Light is generated by particles and is then absorbed and re-emitted by other particles. The process goes on for aeons before light can reach the surface.' After that, it is a mere eight-minute skip across the 93-million mile gap to the Earth. </p> <p>'The sun is not a simple ball of incandescent gas in which hydrogen is quietly being transformed by nuclear fusion into helium,' he added. 'It seethes with activity. Satellites images make it look more like a great plate of writhing spaghetti. Great loops of energy shimmer and twist and occasionally break, hurling huge globs of matter, made up of millions of cubic kilometres of plasma, into space.' </p> <p>And when these coronal mass ejections, as they are known, strike Earth, we feel the impact. Powerful aurora displays appear over the poles, the electronics on satellites are fried, and entire power grids are disrupted. In 1989 a solar storm plunged Quebec into darkness, leaving seven million people without electricity. </p> <p>'Basically, when the sun sneezes we all catch a cold,' said Cambridge astronomer Paul Murdin. </p> <p>In an attempt to understand this solar influenza, a flotilla of four European satellites called Cluster is now swooping around the sun, analysing the streams of particles that pour from its surface. The aim is to predict storms that could otherwise devastate our modern electronically dependant world. </p> <p>But the sun does more than merely disrupt communications and power. Scientists have found that during the 17th and 18th century, sunspots completely disappeared. At the same time, the world plunged into a period called the Little Ice Age. Inuit paddled kayaks from Greenland to tour Scotland's icy coastline, snow fell in summertime, while crops failed and famines killed millions. Scientists believe the two phenomena - cold and lack of sunspots - are closely connected. </p> <p>'We still do not exactly understand the correlation, but it is clear that the sun does not behave in a static, unchanging manner and these alterations have a major impact on our climate,' Priest said. 'Given humanity's role in triggering global warming, it is vital we discover if the sun is going to mitigate or enhance man-made global warming.' </p> <p>Such interest explains the armada being sent, or about to be sent, to study the sun. As well as Soho and Cluster, new missions include Stereo - in which one spaceship will fly ahead of and another behind Earth as it orbits, creating 3-D images of the sun - and Solar Orbiter, which will swoop close to the sun's surface to gain a detailed view of its surface. The lessons learned will be of critical importance not just to understanding our own planet but in providing a key to the rest of the universe. </p> <p>'The sun gives us our only chance to study another star,' said the Open University's Professor Colin Pillinger, one of the scientists who had been hoping to study particles returned by Genesis. </p> <p>'The planets were all created from debris left over from the sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. We also know that the moon and Earth are isotopically very similar and must have a common origin. Mars is different, however. So we want to know which - Earth or Mars - is more like the sun. If Earth is different, we will then want to know why. Perhaps we are made of material left over from an earlier part of the universe's history.' </p> <p>It is a fairly dramatic prospect, and explains why astronomers are so fascinated by the sun. It also explains why scientists will be spending all that time and effort, scrabbling on their knees looking for fragments of Genesis's cargo on the Utah desert floor this week. A little bit of sunshine could tell us an awful lot. </p> <p><strong>Light of our lives </strong></p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The sun is 70 per cent hydrogen and 28 per cent helium. The rest mainly carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> It is 6,000C at its surface; 15,000,000C at its core. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Its diameter is 870,000 miles, 109 times larger than the Earth's.

  "<p>Before I visited Beethoven Clinic in Teplice in the Czech Republic, the TSB in Perth assured me that I could pay the bill for my treatment with my Visa credit card. </p> <p>On the final day, I presented the card for payment but it was declined. I had \u00a3500 in cash but the clinic would not accept sterling. I am 81, speak no Czech and was stranded. The staff tried to phone TSB but had only an automated-response number.</p> <p>By chance, a Scottish gentleman was paying his bill at the same time and offered to pay mine as well. I gave him the cash and sent the balance later.</p> <p>The next day, TSB phoned my home number but I was still in Teplice. I had to pay for an extra day there and miss a planned trip to Prague, losing the hotel accommodation. When I got home, TSB said there was a number I could have called. There was no mention of this anywhere.<br><strong>AB, Perth</strong> </p> <p>You have suffered from the bank's enthusiasm for thwarting fraud. The computer treated the transaction as suspicious, even though you had stayed at the same clinic paying with the same card before and you told the branch beforehand where you were going. The branch should have made sure the credit card computer knew. Technically, your transaction was 'referred' rather than 'declined' and the clinic staff should have phoned a different number to check it was you. Lloyds is sending you \u00a3250 as a goodwill gesture. </p> <p><strong> Wedding gift list failed to deliver</strong> </p> <p> We chose the Gift Registry to hold our wedding present list. A truck arrived with less than half our gifts but including boxes of glasses with some missing and a smashed ceramic bread bin. We complained, had the rest of the money refunded and bought the gifts ourselves, defeating the object of the service. </p> <p>Although we had the money for gifts refunded, our guests paid for wrapping and delivery, neither of which we got.<br><strong>DW, Great Milton</strong> </p> <p>Rapid expansion caused strain on both contact centre and warehouse, says Gift Registry. The person handling your complaint failed to address your grievances and has since left the company. The company is sending you a \u00a3100 John Lewis gift voucher to apologise. </p> <p><strong> Slow response by SpeedFerries</strong> </p> <p> I paid \u00a390 to travel with my car from Dover to Boulogne with the recently launched SpeedFerries. The return crossing on 23 June was cancelled due to bad weather. I was told I would be refunded, I think, half the cost of the cheapest fare. I returned with P&amp;O paying \u00a3175. I have complained to SpeedFerries but had no response.<br><strong>BP, London</strong> </p> <p>SpeedFerries says it refunded \u00a390 - the cost of the whole journey, not just the return leg - to your Visa credit card on 23 June but the bank would not accept the transfer. The company is contacting you to check the account details and will then repay the money. </p> <p><strong> Still funding a February fraud </strong> </p> <p> In February, while I was out of the country, money was spent fraudulently on my Barclaycard over two billing months. Barclaycard cleared payments from the second bill but not the first. </p> <p>This has continued to incur late payment charges and interest and now totals \u00a3505. I have phoned Barclaycard five times, most recently on 27 July when I was told I would receive a written response within 10 days. I have written three times but heard nothing.<br><strong>NO'F, London</strong></p> <p>Barclaycard cleared the second bill because it easily identified the charge as fraudulent. It couldn't do this for the first so says it sent you a dispute form on 10 March. No one at Barclaycard questioned why you kept phoning when it thought you already had a form to fill out. </p> <p>Barclaycard has now cleared the fraudulent transaction from the earlier bill and refunded the late payment and interest charges. </p> <p><strong> Holiday cover is not for fun </strong> </p> <p> I have annual travel insurance with Columbus. On a recent trip to Portugal, I was pickpocketed while queuing at the security barriers before the Sweden v Italy football match. I later found my wallet but the match ticket, cash and coach tickets were missing. </p> <p>Columbus paid for the cash and coach tickets but will not pay for the match ticket. I argued that this was a personal effect but they disagree.<strong><br>PH, London</strong> </p> <p>Insurers' terminology is precise when they want it to be and vague when it suits them. Travel policies cover personal possessions you own permanently, like a camera, and documents that allow you to travel - the coach tickets. But they exclude anything to do with excursions, which is how Columbus describes a football match, even though it is as much part of holiday fun as taking photographs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Email Margaret Dibben at <a href=\"mailto:money.writes@observer.co.uk\">money.writes@observer.co.uk</a> or write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

  "<p>Something does not smell quite right at Sainsbury's - and it has nothing to do with the merchandise.</p> <p>The bid speculation surrounding the retailer has pushed the share price up 10 per cent in a week. You have to work from the base that the market is never wrong. Look at Marks &amp; Spencer: the market picked up on Philip Green's interest well ahead of the Takeover Panel's ultimatum that forced him to go public. </p> <p>It seems sensible to assume that Target, the American discount retailer, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the American finance house, have taken soundings. It is possible that other venture capital outfits have gone a little further than back-of-the-envelope calculations. It is even feasible, though a long shot, to make a case for Wal-Mart coming in for Sainsbury's on the grounds that Tesco is now the unstoppable number one and cannot be challenged in the existing marketplace. </p> <p>But, but, but... the City experts pour cold water on most options. KKR, they say, is too small. Sainsbury's asset value is almost equivalent to the current share price and a huge premium would be needed to take it over. GUS, they say, is a non-starter: why would it want to get into the competitive food marketplace? And GUS and Sainsbury's debt combined would be formidable. Target, they say, has bigger fish to fry on its home soil. </p> <p>They are pointing to Justin King's set-piece recovery plan due to be unveiled mid-October. </p> <p>And yet... why would a bidder wait for King? The only upside for a predator would be if King's performance were so mediocre that he failed to convince the City and the Sainsbury family (under the twin guidance of Lord Sainsbury and trustee Judith Portrait), and actually allowed interested parties to pitch the bid lower. </p> <p>It may be that the speculation is mischief made up by those nasty hedge funds, but we have been here before - with M&amp;S. You ignore the market at your peril.</p> <p><strong>Eisner deserved a script by Tarantino</strong></p> <p>Michael 'Ice Man' Eisner's decision to retire from Disney is a victory for American investor militancy - but only a small one. </p> <p>The Disney boss was very nearly thrown out on his ear at a shareholders' meeting earlier this year when he faced the concerted opposition of shareholders and Roy Disney, nephew of the legendary Walt. He survived by the skin of his teeth, and offered the concession of giving up the chairmanship while remaining chief executive.</p> <p>In contrast, the news that he will quit in two years' time - when he will be 64 - is anti-climactic in the extreme. Eisner has thumbed his nose at investor sentiment, and organised his own leisurely exit.</p> <p>After 20 years at the helm, maybe it is appropriate, and Disney's share price could do without further shocks. But his errors of the past decade - when he squandered the creative advantage that made Disney great and pocketed more than $600 million for doing so - surely deserved a more ignominious end. But then, this is Disneyworld, where even the bad guys never suffer a gory ending. Now if Quentin Tarantino had written the script...</p> <p><strong>Admiral may not thank the FT for its big splash</strong></p> <p>Hell hath no fury like a newspaper scorned, so the delayed reaction of my colleagues on the daily business sections last week was very understandable. The Financial Times had scooped them all on the news that Admiral, the insurance group, was to be floated - with such a detailed report on the planned market listing that the FT must have seen the flotation documents. </p> <p>Good work by the FT hacks involved, but the headline on the piece - a splash on its price-sensitive Companies &amp; Markets section - was worthy of the Mirror 's infamous City Slickers at their worst: 'Flotation of Admiral will reignite IPO market,' it proclaimed. Notice that word 'will'. With the authority of the Pink 'Un to back it up, that was as good as saying 'fill yer boots'.</p> <p>It was left to the Times and Telegraph to inject some realism into the situation, and they did so with relish. They pointed out that it was never a good thing to buy shares in a company where the executives were selling and that the float had all the signs of a sell-out by the big investor, Barclays Capital - and they seriously queried Admiral's valuation. The 'grey market' responded appropriately, with the indicators marked down. Not such a good piece of work by the smart-Alec who fed the FT .</p> <p>For what it's worth, I think Admiral is a good company, with an impressive growth record in a difficult sector. And I like the principle of giving shares to the workforce when a company is floated. But I fear it will get such a bad press from anywhere outside the FT that the flotation will struggle, as most IPOs have this year. Financial journalists do not forgive or forget these things.</p> <p><strong>Camelot's sharp knight</strong></p> <p>Sir Peter Middleton - not the one who rode a Harley-Davidson to work and had affairs with journalists, but the other one who ran a large bank called Barclays - got himself a top job last week with his appointment as chairman of Camelot, the company that runs the National Lottery. </p> <p>It was a good day's work for Diane Thompson, Camelot chief executive, and her recruitment team. Middleton brings gravitas and financial acumen to the lottery to complement its new reputation, recovered after years of decline. More importantly, Middleton brings with him years of experience in dealing with the Treasury, where he was permanent secretary in theEighties. He knows his way round the corridors of power at Number 11, which will be invaluable when Camelot comes to begin its campaign to get its lottery licence renewed next year. And he should be well on top of the intricacies of the changing tax regime within the gambling industry.</p> <p>Ten years into the lottery, it seems that Camelot can still attract people of solid financial calibre.</p>",
  "<b> South Yorkshire</b> <br> <p>Clear, blue, windless skies, glorious sunshine - summer has come, if a little late and short. Alongside Fiddle Neck pond, part of the series at Nicker Wood Farm, dragon-fly and damselfly adults, doomed to die in the winter frosts, warm up quickly in the early sun, then set about the task of assuring future generations of the species. </p> <p>A female common darter skips low above the water's surface, dipping the tip of her abdomen in to disperse eggs as they are laid. In contrast to this scattered approach, a brown hawker, much bigger and bulkier, settles on the edge of an angler's keep net, carefully lowering her abdomen to the water's edge and depositing eggs. She moves off to the bankside and repeats the process, laying eggs into the wet mud. </p> <p>A spectacular male banded demoiselle, the dark blue thumb-sized smudges on his wings identifying him, flutters past. He is an oddity, in that his species prefers silty, slow-flowing rivers and streams. Here, he is on a pond, albeit silty, with no perceptible flow. </p> <p>Elswhere, late summer butterflies are hard at work feeding up for winter hibernation. A red admiral probes deeply at the bright yellow heads of hawkweed oxtongue flowers. More yellow appears, this time from a lone clouded yellow butterfly, its rich, almost orange, wings bounded by a brown edging. A migrant species, over here from France, it is probably the progeny of an earlier traveller, sadly doomed to die off. As with the painted lady and other summer visitors, we occasionally get inter-ruptions, huge populations of particular species, but not this year. </p> <p>A couple of speckled wood, chocolate brown with cream spots, explore the tight, light mauve flowers of creeping thistle. Ten years ago, this would have been notable; today, they have spread through the district, occupying territories in most woods and hedgerows. They even turn up in my back garden.</p>",
  "In this job, it's your fingers and toes that are the first to go. Without gloves, Piers says, he'd only last five minutes and two hours at a time. \"It's pretty much the maximum. Our freezer sits at minus 10 - the optimum as far as the ice goes.\" <p>Which is why he's happy to dress up for the job. \"I wear snow boots and thermal socks. But I also have some lovely tights. I think they're meant for mountaineering. Over those, I wear ski trousers, which, without tights, can get quite scratchy. Although really it's because I just like wearing tights!\" </p> <p>He uses dubbin on his gloves to keep them soft and a big jacket designed for people who work in freezers. </p> <p>The ice comes by ship from Canada. \"We get 180 blocks at a time, which is about 10 tons of ice in one container. It takes three weeks to get to Dover and we pay around \u00a350 for a block.\" </p> <p>December is the busiest time for Piers when he and his co-carver can chip away at 100 blocks a week. </p> <p>The Ice Box started as a delivery cube business before the founders went to America and discovered the delights and potential of the vodka luge market. It's based in a couple of units in the New Covent Market in Vauxhall, south west London where there are three fridges: one for blocks, one for cubes and one to work in. </p> <p>Piers originally studied horticulture, then worked as a landscape designer in Blackburn. When he came to visit his sister in London, seven years ago, he got a job driving and delivering cubes and sculptures for the Ice Box. \"I was moving blocks around and there was this sculptor who was really under pressure. I was fascinated watching him work. My perception was it was all swans, cupids and cheesy stuff.\" </p> <p>In fact, it's now full-size Polos, something Piers made for VW to help them advertise their air conditioning. </p> <p>He starts with a raw block of ice and a chainsaw. \"It removes the largest quantity of ice in the shortest time,\" he says. He imagines that his skills might be transferable to stone, although he prefers working with ice because it's so much quicker. His toolbox contains sanders, drills, irons and a blow torch. </p> <p>He usually works from pictures and drawings, but sometimes he makes a template out of wood. \"I don't regard myself as an artist but I love making things.\" </p> <p>Many of Piers' sculptures end up at corporate parties where they are only good for one night but just in case you're thinking that you could end up swimming with the swans, each sculpture actually sits in a drip tray which has a tube running down into a bucket. \"Being cold is good for productivity,\" says Piers. </p> <p>\"I work with another carver and we're both in the same freezer but we don't go in there for a chat.\" </p> <p>Lots of short breaks are the best. \"Even breathing in warm air is good,\" he says. He always eats hot food at lunchtime. </p> <p>He says he tends not to shave very often because one of the hazards of the job is that he is constantly being covered by a spray of snow. </p> <p>\"Everything that comes off the block stays frozen but we're constantly brushing out snow,\" he says. \"I never take hot drinks in there. There are no industry standards about how long you can stay in the fridge, but if you stay in too long you get so cold that it takes you an hour to get warm again.\" </p> <p>He says the cold agrees with him and the environment appears to be healthier than the average over-heated germ-ridden office in winter. </p> <p>\"I haven't had a cold for five years: I think it's doing me good. I don't know whether I'm actually being naturally frozen. Maybe it's the cryogenic thing and I'll live 'til I'm 180.\" </p> <p>He says that he went into horticulture because that's what his dad used to do, but now he's doing something for himself and has fallen in love with ice. \"Ice has such a wow factor; it's tactile, it's ephemeral.\" </p> <p>Only on the loveliest of summer days does he think about gardening. \"In the winter I think I could be out there in the wet and cold,\" he says. \"Now I'm just getting cold!\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theicebox.com\">theicebox.com</a></p>",
  "<b> Embarrassed ...for \u00a3260 </b> <br> <p>I recently tried to renew my motor insurance by telephone, using my Lloyd's TSB credit card. </p> <p>The transaction was refused by Lloyd's because they said the amount, which was \u00a3260, was too large in comparison with my spending patterns. </p> <p>Yet I had used the same card in nine of the previous 10 years (but not last year) for the same renewal, for about the same amount, with the same insurance company, at about the same date. The car was registered in my name, at my address, where I have lived for 17 years. </p> <p>There was also several thousand pounds in my current account, which I have had for over 40 years. </p> <p>For all the noble talk of fighting international crime, what it amounts to is that Lloyd's preferred to inconvenience and embarrass a very good customer, rather than risk \u00a3260 of their money on a transaction which could not have been fraudulent and was not even suspicious.<br><b>Name and address supplied </b> </p> <p><b> Fuelling the arguments</b><br> </p> <p>This is one of those situations where you are damned if you do and damned if you don't.

When we tried to use it again, in another filling station, it was again declined. </p> <p>It took about 45 minutes before the card was accepted by the attendant and we were asked to telephone the bank. </p> <p>The reason the card was declined was because it had been used to purchase \u00a31,900 of electrical equipment from a store we had not used.

  "<b> Jakarta Post </b> <br> Editorial, September 10 <p>\"The horrendous bomb attack that occurred in front of the Australian embassy in ... Jakarta [on Thursday] morning hammers home the fact that there can be no respite in the fight against terrorism ... While terrorists have the luxury of being able to watch their prey and strike without warning, the authorities have to be forever on the alert, unable to allow their vigilance to slacken for even one moment ... </p> <p>\"It is therefore all the more disturbing that, in the case of [Thursday's] attack, the Indonesian authorities ... appear to have chosen to ignore warnings that were issued only last week by the US and Australian governments alerting their citizens to the possibility of an imminent terrorist attack ... </p> <p>\"Indonesia's top leadership reacted promptly to the disaster ...

It is essential that the people of Jakarta understand we respect, and share, their grief ... Doubtless, the target for the car bomb ... was the Australian embassy. But ordinary Indonesians working in or visiting the building, and just passing by, were as much the intended victims of theattack as Australian nationals. </p> <p>\"Like Bali before it, this awful atrocity demonstrates that the Australian and Indonesian peoples are united in facing a cruel and ruthless enemy ... We do not conclusively know who was responsible for the attack. It may have been the work of murderers motivated by the Indonesian presidential elections. But it clearly carries the signature of the Jemaah Islamiyah [JI] terrorist organisation.\" </p> <p><b> Sydney Morning Herald</b><br> Editorial, September 10  </p> <p> \"The ... blast is likely to swing Australia's election campaign away from the bread-and-butter matters of tax and healthcare and back to national security. The [Australian] prime minister, John Howard, is consistently seen as a strong leader on security issues. His swift response to the explosion, his appropriate sympathy for the families of those Indonesians killed, and his government's record of effective cooperation with the Indonesian authorities after the Bali attacks are all likely to enhance this advantage ... </p> <p>\"While the bombing comes on the eve of the Australian election, it is even closer to Indonesia's landmark presidential poll on September 20. The frontrunner, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is an articulate, outward-looking reformist, who is far more comfortable with Australia than his rival, the incumbent, Megawati Sukarnoputri.\" </p> <p><b> Herald Sun</b> <br>Editorial, Australia, September 10 </p> <p> \"The bomb blast ... has the capacity to severely disrupt the federal election and cool heads among our political leaders must prevail ... We must not allow panic from this latest terrorist outrage to affect the voting intentions of an already severely tested electorate ... It seems certain that Australia was the target. It might be that an attack on Australian soil has been avoided by largely bipartisan political support for our border security. It might also be that our country is still lucky and that we must redouble our efforts to avoid a similar attack on Australian soil. </p> <p>\"It would be simplistic to say that on the eve of the anniversary of the September 11 attacks on America the still-smouldering events of Thursday are not connected [but] it would be foolish to say they are.\" </p> <p><b> Aldo Borgu</b><br> Daily Telegraph, Australia, September 10  </p> <p>\"Some commentators have raised the possibility that the timing is related to the third anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, but if you want to 'celebrate' that now infamous date with another terrorist attack it would have made more sense to actually do so on the day in question.

JI is the most obvious culprit and if that's the case then it signals that they are back in business after more than a year's absence.

  "Nearly 40 years after he defected to communist North Korea, US army staff sergeant Charles Robert Jenkins is today expected to surrender to American military authorities to face a court martial on desertion charges. <p>Mr Jenkins, 64, will arrive at the headquarters of the US army in Japan, Camp Zama, this morning and will live there with his family during the court martial proceedings. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins, from rural North Carolina, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if found guilty. But widespread public sympathy for his wife - a Japanese former nurse who was abducted to North Korea in 1974, where she met and married Mr Jenkins in 1980 - and repeated pleas for leniency from Tokyo may yet allow him to live out his remaining years in Japan. </p> <p>\"The idea is to make this as matter-of-fact and businesslike as possible,\" said Colonel Victor Warzinski, a spokesman for US forces. He said Mr Jenkins would not be led into court handcuffed. </p> <p>He has been receiving treatment at a hospital in Tokyo since he arrived in Japan with his wife, Hitomi Soga, and their daughters, Belinda, 19, and Mika, 21. </p> <p>Despite claims by some of his relatives in America that he was abducted to North Korea, the US military claims that he abandoned his unit on a freezing morning in January 1965 while on patrol near the demilitarised zone that separates North and South Korea. </p> <p>Ms Soga, 45, was among five Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang agents in the late 1970s, but was allowed to return to Japan two years ago. </p> <p>She left her family behind, as her husband feared arrest in Japan. The four were reunited in Jakarta in May, and flew on to Japan a week later. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins faces charges of desertion, aiding the enemy, encouraging disloyalty and encouraging other US soldiers to desert. He may strike a deal to plead guilty to at least one of the charges and share his knowledge of North Korea, in exchange for a light punishment, possibly a dishonourable discharge. </p> <p>In a recent magazine interview from his hospital room, he claimed he had sought asylum from North Korea at the Soviet embassy in Pyongyang in 1966. </p> <p>Under his lawyer's instructions, he did not reveal the circumstances of his arrival in the North, where he taught English and appeared in anti-American propaganda films. </p> <p>He is saving the most sensitive information for US authorities in the hope that they will show leniency. </p> <p>Further heartache for the stoic and likeable Ms Soga and her children would provoke an angry response among many Japanese, although questions are being raised in the country about the use of taxpayers' money to support the family.</p>",
  "Rubbishing cities is a popular sport. Not simply because of the garbage, graffiti, pollution, congestion and crowds people complain about - there is something about the very essence of cities and their inhabitants that offends. too. When Brighton and Hove succeeded in its bid to become a Millennial city, for instance, Julie Burchill declared that wanting to be a city was \"about as sensible and life-affirming as wanting to be a wart\". <p>Surveys have shown that, while around three-quarters of Britain's town- and country-dwellers are satisfied with their quality of life, only about 10% of urbanites are happy. According to Burchill, that's why you see so many of them on the Brighton seafront every weekend - \"thousands of Londoners set free for the day, blinking and smiling with surprise at all this light and space, poor mole-people above ground at last.\"</p> <p>But whatever people say about cities, their behaviour tells a different story. More people live in cities now than ever before. In the 1700s less than 10% of the world's population were city-dwellers. By 1900 the proportion had reached 25%; today it stands at around 50% and the trend is set to continue. Soon, two out of every three people on Earth will be living in a city. Will they all be complaining, or will the city have become a better place? </p> <p>At the very least, life in cities should offer more variety and be more fulfilling than a life spent scratching a bare living direct from the soil; it might even be more fun. But as cities have severed the ties that once bound people firmly to the land, so the links between urban and rural environments have become more important than ever. The inhabitants of today's cities are more utterly dependent on the services of nature than at any previous time in history. We tend to forget that, while London, Paris, Venice, New York and numerous other cities sustain and entertain millions of us, cities are monstrous parasites, consuming the resources of regions vastly larger than themselves and giving very little back. In fact, though cities today occupy only 2% of Earth's land surface, they consume more than 75% of its resources. The implications of that are powerfully illustrated by a concept environmental scientists developed during the 1990s: the ecological footprint.</p> <p>Question: \"What is 120 times the size of London?\" Answer: \"The land area required to supply London's needs.\" Having analysed the workings of London as though the city were a giant machine, consuming resources and spewing out wastes, researchers found that although the city itself occupies an area of only about 1,500 square kilometres, London actually requires roughly 20 million square kilometres of territory for its supplies and waste disposal. This is London's ecological footprint. Though the city is home to just 12% of Britain's population, it uses the equivalent of all Britain's productive land. In reality, of course, the horizons that supply London extend beyond the British Isles to the wheat prairies of Kansas, the soybean fields of the Mato Grosso, the forests of Scandinavia - and thousands of other locations.</p> <p>The ecological footprints of many cities have been assessed in this way, and the results are uniformly alarming. Vancouver, for instance, though rated highly in terms of the quality of life its half a million residents enjoy, has an ecological footprint more than 200 times the size of the city. The 29 largest cities of the Baltic Sea drainage system appropriate the resources of an area 565 times larger than the land they occupy. </p> <p>Furthermore, the assessment of ecological footprints puts a measure on the enormous disparities in resource appropriation that have opened up between the world's developed and developing regions. For example: each of North America's 300 million inhabitants consumes the resources of about 4.7 hectares (11.75 acres) per year on average - the equivalent of almost 10 soccer pitches. That is a huge, disproportionate chunk of Earth's surface, especially when compared with the average of just 0.4 hectare (about half the size of the centre court at Wimbledon) that each of India's one billion inhabitants manages on. And consider this: 80% of North Americans live in cities - many without even a windowbox, never mind a productive garden the size of 10 soccer pitches. In India only 30% of people live in cities; the remainder are sustained entirely by their notional half a tennis court.</p> <p>Meanwhile, of course, global resources have remained finite. Ominously, as the human population has risen above 6 billion, and cities have grown to accommodate an ever larger proportion of them, the ecologically productive land \"available\" to each person has decreased, from about 5.6 hectares per person in 1900 to three hectares in 1950, and down to no more than 1.5 hectares now. That means that the ecological footprint of the average North American (4.7 hectares) is more than three times his or her share of Earth's resources. So, if living standards everywhere were raised to levels that the average North American enjoys, we would need three planets to provide for them all. That's not an option, but redressing the balance between urban and rural environments could help.</p> <p>Given the success of the evolutionary trajectory humanity pursued for the first few million years - no other species has achieved such total dominance of the global environment - cities are a complete contradiction. It is biology that drives evolution and, from a biological point of view, cities are a seriously bad idea. The dangers of disease multiply when people are crowded together, and our aversion to squalor and unpleasant odours is a measure of the depth at which an innate acknowledgement of those dangers is set in our evolutionary history. We are social animals, true enough, but there are limits, and our hunting and gathering ancestors probably had the numbers about right. They were nomadic, moving around in groups of up to 40 or so, and never staying long enough in one place for pathogens to build up to potentially deadly levels. But cities have been - quite literally - the breeding grounds of disease.</p> <p>Bacterial and viral diseases are the price humanity has paid to live in large and densely populated cities. Virtually all the familiar infectious diseases have evolved only since the advent of agriculture, permanent settlement and the growth of cities. Most were transferred to humans from animals - especially domestic animals. Measles, for instance, is akin to rinderpest in cattle; influenza came from pigs; smallpox is related to cowpox. Humans share 296 diseases with domestic animals. </p> <p>Thus, until comparatively recent times, cities had a well-earned reputation for being unhealthy places. In the early 19th century half the children born in Manchester died before they were five years old; in London half died before the age of three, and conditions were even worse in Vienna and Stockholm, where half died before they were two. No wonder demographers and historians write of the \"urban graveyard effect\". Deaths exceeded births in all great cities. The amazing thing is that cities continued to grow. Despite their deathly reputation, more and more people wanted to live in them.</p> <p>Between 1551 and 1801, for instance, the population of London grew more than tenfold, from 80,000 to 865,000, even though deaths consistently exceeded births throughout those 250 years. Left to its own reproductive capacity, London would have died out. It survived and grew by attracting thousands of migrants from the countryside, where death rates were generally 50% lower than in the cities, and birth rates 13% higher. Clearly, living conditions were healthier in the countryside. But, as agriculture and cottage industries such as spinning and weaving were mechanised, redundant labour had no choice but to seek employment elsewhere - and the industrial cities beckoned. </p> <p>In the 30 years to 1910, Vienna's population trebled to more than 2 million in this way; the population of Paris soared from 2.25 million to 4.8 million during roughly the same period, and London gained 3.5 million new residents. New York grew from a city of 1.9 million in 1875 to become the home of nearly 8 million people by 1925, making it the world's largest city. New York was still leading in 1950, with 12.3 million inhabitants; and again in 1960, with 14.2 million; but by 1970 the greatest growth had moved around the globe. Japan's postwar economic achievements had pushed Tokyo into first place, with 16.5 million inhabitants, a position it still holds. At the time of writing, second place is taken by Mexico City, an ascendancy indicating that economic vitality is no longer a primary determinant of city growth. Huge cities have been appearing in all parts of the world - in poor countries as well as in the regions of greatest wealth. In 1970 only three cities - Tokyo, New York and Shanghai - had 10 million or more inhabitants; 30 years later there were 19 of them, 14 in the developing world. And the trend is set to continue: by 2020 at least 23 cities will have passed the 10 million mark, all but four in developing countries. By then, several cities in the developing world are likely to have populations of more than 20 million. In all, nearly 600 cities will have a million or more inhabitants by 2020. Of those, more than 400 will be in developing countries.</p> <p>The quality of life for many in the cities of the developing world is desperately low, with squatter or slum housing being the norm rather than the exception. But, contrary to the idealised western view of the countryside as a haven to which city-dwellers yearn to escape, conditions are far worse in the rural areas. The cities may be poor, but the countryside is poorer still.</p> <p>The brutal fact is that, while one-third or more of city-dwellers in the developing world live on or below the poverty line, only about one-third of the rural population lives above it. A typical study of urbanisation in the developing world concludes that despite appalling housing conditions, lack of fresh water and services, minimal health care and few chances of finding a job, the urban poor are on average \"better off than their rural cousins, on almost every indicator of social and economic well-being\". </p> <p>Better off? Well-being? Don't ask how the lives of these impoverished city-dwellers compare with those of the 90% of British urbanites who are dissatisfied with their quality of life. Only note that, for many millions of people, cities are the solution, not the problem.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>John Reader is the author of Cities (William Heinemann, \u00a320)</p>",

And yet the tunes were by Hoagy Carmichael, and performed by husky, busty Jane Russell. Russell plays a nightclub singer who returns to Vegas with apparently wealthy husband Vincent Price and runs into her beefy ex, Victor Mature. He's now a cop and of course there's a murder, with Russell in peril.</p> <p><strong>The Happiest Millionaire</strong> (Norman Tokar, 1967) <br>3.10pm, BBC2</p> <p>The last film personally supervised by Walt Disney is a meandering but at times exuberant musical set in the Philadelphia, 1916 home of eccentric millionaire Fred MacMurray. Tommy Steele is the chirpy Oirish butler who matches Jeeves in the saving-the-day stakes; Lesley Ann Warren is the tomboy daughter who turns all lovey-dovey, and there's a pet alligator snapping about too.</p> <p><strong>The Professionals</strong> (Richard Brooks, 1966) <br>4.05pm, C4</p> <p>A small band of very tough, very professional gunmen pitted against hundreds of bandidos down Mexico way. The pros are Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Woody Strode; they're hired to rescue kidnapped Claudia Cardinale from the clutches of Jack Palance. With the good guys just as ruthless as the bad, it's closer to The Wild Bunch than The Magnificent Seven and, for aficionados, features some of the wild west's first bared breasts.</p> <p><strong>The Day Of The Jackal</strong> (Fred Zinnemann, 1973) <br>9.10pm, BBC2</p> <p>Zinnemann's attention to detail seems closer to Frederick Forsyth's intricate novel than the later Bruce Willis/Richard Gere double act, and he pulls off the feat of sustaining suspense, even though we know the Jackal must fail. Edward Fox is impassively effective as the cold-fish English assassin contracted to kill General De Gaulle.</p> <p><strong>Heartbreakers</strong> (David Mirkin, 2001) <br>9.10pm, C4</p> <p>Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt are a mother-and-daughter con team: Weaver marries a rich man, then Hewitt seduces him, gets discovered, and the pair pocket a big divorce settlement. But complicating their clever scam are Gene Hackman's obnoxious tobacco tycoon, former victim Ray Liotta, nice Palm Beach bar-owner Jason Lee, and an unhealthy rivalry that develops between the two women. Not exactly side-splitting, but still an enjoyably witty and well-acted comedy.</p> <p><strong>Bulworth</strong> (Warren Beatty, 1998) <br>11.25pm, ITV1</p> <p>Democrat senator Jay Bulworth , sick of the empty promises he mouths, takes out a large insurance policy, hires a hitman to assassinate him, and starts giving the voters the truth, whether they like it or not (come on, Dubya, give it a whirl). Amid the sharp rapping politics, his romance with a young woman (Halle Berry) is a little obvious, but this is a barbed, brave and entertaining satire that director star Beatty also co-produced and co-wrote.</p> <p><strong>Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey</strong> (Peter Hewitt, 1991) <br>1.20am, ITV1</p> <p>Those lovably, dopey dudes return in a sequel that's bigger and funnier than the original. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are once again the airhead Californians, now terminated by robot-doppelg\u00e4ngers sent back from the future by evil Joss Ackland. Which is fine, because they get the chance to save mankind and play games with the grim reaper. He fancies chess, a la Bergman's The Seventh Seal; they prefer Battleships.</p> <p><strong>Sunday 12 September</strong></p> <p><strong>The Caine Mutiny</strong> (Edward Dmytryk, 1954) <br>3.40pm, Five</p> <p>Dmytryck's naval drama changes course rapidly from spectacular action to stolid court martial confrontation, but it's a shipshape movie for all that. Adapted from Herman Wouk's Pulitzer prize-winning novel, it stars a visibly ailing Humphrey Bogart as the paranoid, deeply unlikable Captain Queeg, relieved of his command of a US destroyer by his fellow officers, who are then then charged with mutiny.</p> <p><strong>Snake Eyes</strong> (Brian De Palma, 1998) <br>9pm, Five</p> <p>The bravura opening, a single 12-minute take in which we follow Nicolas Cage's hustler-cum-cop Santoro going about his dodgy business in an Atlantic City sports stadium before a big fight, is a homage to De Palma's beloved Hitchcock, and enticingly sets the scene for a gripping thriller. The champ takes a dive; and despite the attentions of Santoro's security-chief chum Dunne (Gary Sinise) a political bigwig is shot. Are the two events linked? An entertaining, just-about credible yarn, though the visual trickery grows distracting.</p> <p><strong>Alien Resurrection</strong> (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 1997) <br>10pm, C4</p> <p>Fourth of the Alien series, set 200 years on from Alien 3, with Sigourney Weaver's cloned Ripley back from the dead to face the creatures once more. True, the macabre ramifications of genetic mutation give way to the usual run-before-they-get-you mayhem; but Jeunet adds some ghoulish touches to the action and the humans - a band of space pirates, including snarling Michael Wincott and Ron \"Hellboy\" Perlman; Winona Ryder's elfin Call, and particularly the enigmatic super-Ripley - are as freaky as the monsters.</p> <p><strong>Dead Ringers</strong> (David Cronenberg, 1988) <br>11.45pm, BBC2</p> <p>Cronenberg's unsettling story has identical twins involved with the same woman (Genevieve Bujold), without telling her that her lover is in fact two men. More disturbing still, the brothers are gynaecologists, and Cronenberg plays queasily with images of flesh and straps and surgical instruments. Jeremy Irons is excellent as the twins.</p> <p><strong>The Fan</strong> (Tony Scott, 1996) <br>12midnight, C4</p> <p>Robert De Niro cruises through another study in obsession in Scott's flashy, trashy thriller. De Niro's Gil Renard is a sad salesman and fanatical supporter of the San Francisco Giants baseball team who takes to stalking their ace new player (Wesley Snipes): when the latter is replaced by Benicio Del Toro's hot young star, Renard takes it very personally.</p> <p><strong>Monday 13 September</strong></p> <p><strong>Jacob's Ladder</strong> (Adrian Lyne, 1990) <br>12.20am, BBC1</p> <p>Several rungs removed from Lyne's glossy sex shenanigans - Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, Lolita - but whether up or down is hard to say. It's a dark, disorientating journey through the mind of a Viet vet (Tim Robbins) wrecked by the war and specifically by the drug experimentally given to the GIs to turn them into hell's commandos. The fractured, dreamlike structure is sometimes confusing, but undeniably powerful.</p> <p><strong>The Anderson Tapes</strong> (Sidney Lumet, 1971) <br>12.40am, C4</p> <p>Perhaps more relevant today than when it was made 30 years ago, Lumet's thriller shows how electronic surveillance can reveal the smallest details, but may obscure the big picture. Sean Connery is a master thief just out of prison and busy on the big heist - the systematic looting of a plush apartment block. He makes his plans and assembles the traditional team of eccentric experts, unaware that every move is being spied on by government agencies. A clever, cool caper movie that also has Christopher Walken in an early appearance.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 14 September</strong></p> <p><strong>Up'n'Under</strong> (John Godber, 1998) <br>11.05pm, BBC1</p> <p>A mildly diverting comedy set in the broken-nosed, thick-eared world of Yorkshire pub seven-a-side rugby. Nice guy Gary Olsen bets his house that his Wheatsheaf weeds will beat oily Tony Slattery's Cobbler's Arms crunchers; Samantha Janus from the local fitness centre is on hand to knock the lads into shape, and to do an entirely gratuitous shower scene. The rugby action make the football in Escape To Victory look good, but with TV talents such as Neil Morrissey and Griff Rhys Jones involved it's entertaining enough.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 15 September</strong></p> <p><strong>Angel Face</strong> (Otto Preminger, 1952) <br>2pm, BBC2</p> <p>Jean Simmons stars as Diane Tremayne, the sweetest of femme fatales, whose angelic features and demeanour conceal her intention to murder her stepmother and father.

  "Simon Mann, the leader of the failed coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea, was starting a seven-year jail sentence in Zimbabwe last night for trying to buy weapons from Zimbabwe's state arms manufacturer. <p>A court in Harare ruled that the Old Etonian and former SAS officer should stay behind bars until 2011, crushing his hopes that British establishment figures could use their money and influence to secure his freedom. </p> <p>Handing down judgment at a makeshift court in the maximum security Chikurubi prison, the magistrate, Mishrod Guvamombe, said the offences were serious. \"The accused was the author of the whole transaction. He was caught while trying to take the firearms out of the country.\" </p> <p>Mann would serve four years for attempting to purchase dangerous weapons and three more for trying to buy them without a licence, he said. </p> <p>A defence lawyer, Jonathan Samkange, protested against the sentence but said there would not be an appeal. \"I think it was excessive and it induces a sense of shock,\" he said. </p> <p>The sentence marked the end of an extraordinary odyssey which took Mann across Europe and Africa to drum up money and materiel for an attempt to seize power in Equatorial Guinea, an oil-rich dictatorship in west Africa. </p> <p>Mann, 51, was arrested in March at Harare airport while waiting for assault rifles, grenade launchers and ammunition to be loaded on to a Boeing 727 filled with mercenaries recruited from South Africa. </p> <p>Mann had hoped that Sir Mark Thatcher and other alleged backers of the plot would spend what he called \"a large splodge of wonga\" to secure his release but instead Sir Mark was himself arrested in South Africa and bailed with money from his mother, Lady Thatcher. </p> <p>Mann faced a maximum sentence of 10 years after being convicted two weeks ago of trying to purchase arms from the state-owned Zimbabwean Defence Industries. Shuffling into court yesterday in prison-issue khaki shorts and shirt he showed no emotion when the sentence was declared. He returned to his solitary cell in handcuffs and leg irons. </p> <p>Two flight crew members were jailed for 16 months and the 66 alleged mercenaries who were on the plane were jailed for 12 months on minor immigration and aviation charges. </p> <p>Defence lawyers said the men were bound for the Democratic Republic of Congo to guard mines and that the weapons were legally purchased. The court rejected that argument but did acquit Mann of taking possession of the weapons, a graver offence than attempting to do so. </p> <p>Mann, a scion of the Watney's brewing empire, is a veteran of African conflicts through his involvement with the mercenary outfit Executive Outcomes. </p> <p>The aim of the coup was to topple President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and install an exiled opposition leader, Severo Moto, who would grant favourable oil concessions.</p>",
  "<p>Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado is talking about the marine iguanas with which he spent three months, and he can barely contain himself. They are giant lizards, or tiny dinosaurs, with claws like diamant\u00e9 gloves. \"Oh boy!\" he says. \"They were so incredible, and they're completely different from one island to another, and some places there are thousands of them, and when you see these guys, it probably took them hundreds of thousands, millions, of years to be what they are: at first they were land iguanas, then they learned how to swim and how to dive and drink salt water, and they developed glands to eliminate salt water - incredibly sophisticated.\" He finally takes a breath. \"Soooo sweet! There is a picture of one iguana embracing another.\" </p> <p>Salgado has just spent three months in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where Darwin visited 169 years ago and refined his theories of evolution. For Salgado, this is the first stop on an eight-year project called Genesis, all of which will appear in Guardian Weekend. He says it is the last project he will undertake on such a scale. </p> <p>The great Brazilian photographer, now 60, has given his life to long-term projects - workers, landless peasants, children, migrants. He took his camera where few photographers bothered or dared to go. His most famous photographs are of the garimpeiros, the mud-soaked prospectors who climbed up and down open-cast Brazilian gold mines, hoping against hope to find a nugget of gold in their buckets of dirt. These pictures, taken in 1986, look like stills from a Cecil B DeMille movie of Dante's Inferno - an epic vision of hell with 50,000 extras and no stars. </p> <p>His last major project was Migrations, or Exodus, as he prefers to call it. Over seven years, he took photographs of migrants from Africa, Asia and South America, many of whom had fled ethnic and religious conflict and genocidal regimes. Often his subjects, particularly the children, stare at the camera - strong, confrontational, giddy, laughing, heroic, even in their despair. Sometimes they are too ill or frightened to do so. Arthur Miller called Salgado's photographs an act of deep devotion. </p> <p>But Exodus left him questioning his faith in humanity. He had seen so much man-made suffering. The idealist began to have his doubts about our essential goodness. \"I was injured in my heart and my spirit. For me, it was terrible what I saw. I came away from this with incredible despair.\" He was desperate to find something that would restore faith. </p> <p>Hence Genesis. Yes, we may already have destroyed 50% of the planet, but Salgado wants to show us what we have left, and what we stand to lose if we don't take care. \"In the end, the only heritage we have is our planet, and I have decided to go to the most pristine places on the planet and photograph them in the most honest way I know, with my point of view, and of course it is in black and white, because it is the only thing I know how to do. I want to see if I can put a kind of virginity in these pictures, if you can say that, and to show 100% respect to nature and the animals.\" </p> <p>Salgado was given permission by the National Park of the Gal\u00e1pagos and the Darwin Foundation to go anywhere on the islands. Although tourism is allowed and fishing permitted in the surrounding waters, both are heavily regulated. He hired a boat and spent most of the time with only the birds and animals for company. After a lifetime photographing humans, it was a radical departure. In these pictures, you can almost hear the silence, and feel the heat rising from the lava. </p> <p>His work has always been about identity and belonging (or not belonging). Salgado is a half-Jewish Portuguese Lithuanian Brazilian, and himself a migrant. He was born in a rural community in Brazil, the sixth child of a cattle rancher, moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, where he studied to become an economist, and finally fled to Paris in 1969 to escape Brazil's military dictatorship. He did a PhD in economics, then worked as an economist for the International Coffee Organisation. After decades away, he is now back in Brazil. </p> <p>He was almost 30 when he took up photography. He started playing around with his wife's camera on a trip to Africa in 1973. That was that - he decided to change careers. He was invited to join Magnum in 1979. Now he has his own agency, Amazonas Images. </p> <p>His work is fearlessly political - life is political, so of course photography will be, too. He has never shied away from bullets or death. Some of Salgado's most haunting photographs document a demonstration by landless peasants in 1996 that resulted in the police killing 19 protesters. Other pictures belonging to the same series show 12,000 marchers breaking open the paddock to a vast estate and reclaiming the land from an absentee landlord. </p> <p>Genesis is also about land and belonging - this time, to the planet. It seems ironic that he has begun Genesis on the Gal\u00e1pagos. After all, it is on this archipelago off the coast of Ecuador that Darwin's work pretty much did for creationism. I ask him if he has belatedly found religion. \"No,\" he says. \"I'm not a religious person. The language of photography is symbolic.\" As is the title. </p> <p>His own spiritual regeneration has been aided by another long-term project, the Instituto Terra. Back home in Brazil, Salgado has spent 13 years rebuilding a rainforest where his father's cattle used to graze. \"All the birds are coming back, the river is flowing again, the environment is working, and all this has made such a difference to my relationship with nature. My life has completely changed,\" he says. Sometimes friends visit him and are shocked by what they see - the snakes and scorpions and crocodiles. \"We have become so far away from our planet. We see nature as something that has to be tamed or eradicated. We think we are superior beings, completely rational. And, my God, the next generation, what kind of planet are we leaving them?\" </p> <p>His work has often been called cinematic, and perhaps following Exodus with Genesis can be seen as another modern-day movie convention - the prequel. This is the world before we conquered it. Some of the pictures of the iguanas and the tortoises look as if they could have been conjured up by the props department for an Ed Wood B-movie. The creatures look so prehistoric, so Jurassic Park, comically unreal. But Salgado's point is that they are real and they have survived where we haven't meddled. </p> <p>His three months in the Gal\u00e1pagos were wonderful, he says. \"I was in front of one giant tortoise I am 100% sure was there when Darwin came 170 years ago. And as I photographed this giant tortoise, it looked at me with the experience and authority of 200 years. Oh boy! What a privilege. It gave me so much pleasure to be alone with these animals, just looking at them. They - the cormorants and iguanas and sea lions - allowed me to participate in their space, and that is something fantastic.\" </p> <p>He talks with awe of the resilience of the green sea turtles, the albatrosses that show such kindness to their life companions, and the sea lions so curious and affectionate that they lie down next to you, their body touching yours. He has already visited gorillas in Africa for the second stage of his project, and is about to spend time with whales in Argentina. I tell him that there seems to be so much hope in this project and he is pleased. \"This is the point for me, that there is a hope. So many times I've photographed stories that show the degradation of the planet. I had one idea to go and photograph the factories that were polluting, and to see all the deposits of garbage. But, in the end, I thought the only way to give us an incentive, to bring hope, is to show the pictures of the pristine planet - to see the innocence. And then we can understand what we must preserve.\"</p>",
  "It won't be as bad as you think. There is no need for the world in 2020 to be one in which nation fights nation over the contents of a drying river bed. There is no need for the world's poorest people to be dying for want of clean water, nor for droughts to cause mass starvation as whole regions see their food supplies wither away in waterless heat. That might happen, but if we can summon the political and economic will, we can avert it. <p>In fact, we can address the most crucial area of water scarcity - finding enough water to feed the world - without ever getting our hands wet, thanks to the concept of \"virtual water\", which has nothing to do with computers. We will be helped in getting water to the world by social trends that are already underway, such as the flight from the country to the cities. And the rich - that's us - will probably not be as selfish with water as one might fear. We are likely to continue to adapt our usage of the water we are endowed with, and we are likely to be putting water back into the environment - by using less fresh water in farming, for example.</p> <p>Water shortages don't pose serious problems to gardeners in Hampshire or to Californian homeowners with pools to fill. The rich can find a way through. Their water suppliers can build a desalination plant; they can use their water more carefully; they can sometimes even get farmers to stop using water for a while.</p> <p>The people who suffer when water is in short supply are the poor. About one in six of the world's 6.5 billion people do not have a safe and secure water supply, and most poor families are short of water for the daily needs we take for granted. But the water-saving measures open to the rich are not open to them. If you get your water from a well you cannot stick a brick in the toilet cistern to use less water when you flush. Farmers in poor countries cannot stop farming. If they did, their families would die. And because poor communities cannot change the way they manage water, they are the ones who will suffer if water is scarce in 2020.</p> <p>The key to avoiding catastrophic water shortages is bringing people out of poverty, and the world is getting richer. At the moment there are between 1 billion and 1.5 billion rich people in the world; by 2020 there could be 2 billion to 2.5 billion. That would not have the desired effect if the world's population was expanding at the rate the \"scary science\" of the 1970s postulated. Fortunately, it is not. In 1994, demographers at the UN population conference in Cairo argued that the world's population would level off in the second half of the 21st century at around 50% higher than the current level. While this increase might sound like a great deal, it is within our capabilities to make sure the world has the water it needs. Food production accounts for 90% of water consumption, but there is sufficient water in the global system to meet the food needs of a world population at that level, and farmers have shown over the past century they can mobilise the world's natural resources - including water and energy - to meet huge increases in demand for food. </p> <p>Energy, in fact, is likely to be a far more crucial factor than water in slowing down production, even in agriculture. Water will not be such a problem because we will have achieved major economies in water use, which will mean more production per drop. Production in regions that currently can manage only low yields is likely to improve by between 50% and 100%.</p> <p>Why, then, do headline writers insist on the notion of water as source of crisis and conflict? In part, because it is easier to see water as a geographic feature, a seemingly static resource: we think of water as being lakes and rivers. In fact, water is everywhere, in many forms. In the past half-century, for example, we have discovered that the industrialised economies in temperate regions, such as Europe and North America, have surplus soil water resources. Soil water is the effective rainfall used to produce a wide range of rainfed crops, and especially the staple grains that are needed to meet the world's food needs. Though it rarely comes up in discussions of water crises, soil water is what makes possible well over half the world's crop production. Water is present in the food we produce, as well: not as an ingredient, but as an element in its production (remember, 90% of water consumption takes place during food production). </p> <p>To understand the full implications of that, take the case of the desert regions of the Middle East and North Africa. Those areas entered a period of dangerous strategic water deficits in the early 1970s. If ever there was a good time to suffer a severe water shortage, that was it. </p> <p>The early 1970s saw the farmers of North America and Europe putting staple grains on the world market at half their production cost. They are still doing that, aided by production and export subsidies that will be difficult to unpick within the next 20 years. It takes so much water to produce those vast mountains of grain that when they are exported they amount, in effect, to a global trade in water. That process can spectacularly fix water shortages. It takes 1,000 tonnes of water to produce a tonne of grain, so by importing grain, water-scarce economies can avoid the stress of trying to develop their own water sources for food production. And because 20% of the world's agricultural production is traded internationally, farmers and traders can move this \"virtual water\" in volumes and over distances beyond the wildest imaginings of engineers.</p> <p>The trade in virtual water addresses the biggest water challenge for both individuals and nations facing water scarcity: how to use water to produce enough food. Virtual water also eases the pressure that irrigated agriculture places on water in the environment. It is true that large-scale irrigation is an inefficient use of water, but the trade in virtual water means those regions where irrigation is crucial can put water back into the environment.</p> <p>What of the 10% of water used for activities other than agriculture? Come 2020, domestic water will still be in short supply for the very poor, who will have neither the resources nor the quality of government to address their problems. But the issue is not that there is too little water, rather that too little effort has been expended on finding economic solutions to the problem. If strong, diverse economies can be established in the poor countries, that will enable investment to ensure the necessary supplies of fresh water for non-agricultural use. And virtual water will account for the volumes needed for food production.</p> <p>Technology will also help the world make water available for domestic and commercial use. Desalination costs, for example, have fallen over the past five years, and the process can provide affordable water for the 70% of the world's population that lives close to major bodies of water. At a cost of around 30p per cubic metre, desalinated water is well within the price range of those living in industrialised economies. At present, the poor can pay nearly \u00a32 per cubic metre for water that is not even safe to drink.</p> <p>The problem with desalination is that it depends on a secure energy supply, and energy futures are much more uncertain than water futures. The water future could be constrained by the availability of affordable energy. So although we can project that by 2025, and certainly by 2050, a significant proportion of the world's population will be augmenting their freshwater supplies using desalination technology, the possible brake on the process is that energy prices will rise as the economies of east and south Asia expand in the next two decades, exerting new demands on the global energy supply. It is impossible at this point to guess how high a priority of water manufacture will be in an energy-short world. </p> <p>As an optimist, I believe the manufacture of fresh water is such a huge imperative that the world's leaders will have to address it. I do not believe the politics of allocating energy to water creation will be a problem. And desalination is not the only option. Each drop of London tap water has been through several people; there is no reason why domestic water cannot be reused in the developing world, where economies facing water scarcity are increasingly treating waste water. Some countries gain 20% of their supply from reuse. </p> <p>Only 10% of water is for non-agricultural use: we could, in theory, get 70% of that back by treating waste water (although there are social problems with water recycling - some people will not drink water that has already been drunk by someone else). So there is no need for a global water shortage. And there is no need for conflict over water. But still we find it difficult to understand the issues surrounding water scarcity, and because we do not understand them we find it difficult to address them all. We do not include soil water in our reckonings, even though it is the major source of water for rural economies. We forget the equalising role of virtual water, which moves commodities that require huge amounts of water to produce from the water-rich to the water-scarce economies. And there is too little understanding of the role of socio-economic development in giving the water-short access to virtual water. </p> <p>The problem is that what we need to do to supply water to all runs counter to one of the most deeply rooted human needs: the desire for familiarity and security. Most people - western consumers of expensive foreign bottled waters and imported delicacies aside - feel intuitively insecure if they cannot drink local water and eat locally produced food. Across the world, the hundreds of millions who comprise the rural poor do not have the levels of consumer and economic sophistication that are second nature to people in the industrialised world. As a result they are uneasy about accepting any dependence on what they regard as a complex and unfathomable economic system.</p> <p>But surely it is easy to inform people they have nothing to fear and everything to gain? Sadly, no. The politicians responsible for more than half the world's rural population do not have the resources or political capital, nor the economic policy options, to confront the beliefs of the rural poor. For those people, new ways of thinking and new approaches to water are not an option. There are no other jobs. Once again, however, there is a bright side. It has been estimated that by 2025 two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities, where life is more water efficient. The policeman in Nairobi, the call-centre worker in Mumbai and the teacher in Mexico City will use negligible volumes of water each day but can be far better paid than their counterparts in the fields.</p> <p>A building occupying a site of a hectare could accommodate 1,000 workers. Those people could generate an annual turnover of \u00a330m, but would use only 10,000 cubic meters of water each year. If that hectare were to be used as a wheat field, it might use the same amount of water, but would generate a turnover of less than \u00a32,000 per year and would only support one tenth of one job. So the key to efficient use of water, through the deployment of virtual water, is job creation and removing people from poverty.</p> <p>The challenge facing the world between now and 2020 is making sure poor people have access to small volumes of safe water - the 10% needed to keep families healthy and employable. And the best way to do that is to develop diverse economies. That is the powerful invisible process that will enable the water rich to improve the lives of the millions of people living in economic and water poverty.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Tony Allan is professor of geography at SOAS in London.

  "China's rise through America's eyes: \"When a speeding freight train is heading towards you, you either get on board or you get out of the way. We want to get on board.\" The locomotive is China, whose economy is forecast to become the second largest in the world by 2016 and to have overtaken America by 2041. \"We\" are the people of South Carolina, the southern US state whose textile-based economy is under increasing threat from cheap labour in the People's Republic. And getting on board means trying to get the Chinese to invest in the state rather than trying to keep them out by erecting protective trade barriers. <p>The speaker is Mark Sanford, South Carolina's Republican governor, who has travelled to Beijing to attract Chinese investment to revive its beleaguered economy. He is speaking at a private dinner in a club so exclusive that it doesn't have a name, just an unmarked red door in a windowless wall. The late Deng Xiaoping used to come here to relax, but today the mix of privacy and transparency has become an irresistible magnet to China's nouveau riche. </p> <p>In his Southern drawl, Sanford speaks elegiacally of a knitwear factory that closed in his neighbouring state of North Carolina. This closure, and others like it, have led to a heated debate about attempts to restrict \"off-shoring\". Sanford explains that his goal is to attract investment from Chinese companies such as Haier, which built a fridge factory in South Carolina in 2000, completing an integrated system of production and sales with its design centre in Los Angeles and trade centre in New York. He speaks about turning his state into a \"poster-boy\" for globalisation, a Chinese gateway into America, reversing the sense of an inexorable flow of jobs and business from the US to China, and creating a \"win-win\" scenario. The Chinese roar with approval at his speech: they like this new face of America, as supplicant rather than bully. </p> <p>But Sanford is a lonely voice in preaching the need to woo China, despite the overwhelming force of the statistics: China has a population of more than a billion, an economy that is growing year-on-year by more than 8%, and had a trade surplus with the US of $124bn in 2003; Chinese imports into the US are outpacing American exports to China by more than five to one. More typical, perhaps, are the words of Roger W Robinson Jr, the former chairman of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the official body charged with assessing the security implications of the trade between the US and China. \"The US-China economic relationship is heavily imbalanced and undermining our long-term economic health,\" he said at the launch of the commission's last report. John Edwards, the vice-presidential nominee who represents the neighbouring state of North Carolina in the Senate, has taken a much tougher line than Sanford: he promises to review US trade agreements and investigate workers' rights abuses in China.</p> <p>China's growing economic power is doing much more than harming America's trade figures. Its development needs huge quantities of oil, forcing up prices on the world market. That is another big campaign issue in the world's most oil-hungry nation. According to the International Energy Agency, China will generate one-third of global incremental demand for oil between 2002 and 2004. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times has argued: \"As Asian growth continues, the global balance between demand and supply will continue to be tight, unless (or until) a vast increase in investment takes place. With such tight markets, relatively modest disruptions could lead to explosive jumps in oil prices, as happened twice in the 1970s.\"</p> <p>If the US Democrats are exercised by China's economic threat, the Republicans have focused on its military one. President George Bush's first intelligence briefing from the CIA listed China as one of three strategic threats, along with terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The thin red mist descends and China becomes, in the neo-con imagination, a Soviet Union of the east, intent on establishing puppet regimes, governed by a modern mandate from heaven. Though not all would go as far as denouncing Deng Xiaoping as a \"chain smoking communist dwarf\", as the rightwing firebrand Pat Buchanan did, there is a segment of the US political class that recoils at reports of double-digit increases in Chinese military spending, an intense focus on military modernisation and the simmering tensions over Taiwan. </p> <p>Back in 1997, Paul Wolfowitz, the neo-conservative flag-carrier who is now deputy defence secretary, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs that compared the rise of China at the dawn of the 21st century to the rise of Germany a century earlier. He characterised China as \"a country that felt it had been denied its place in the sun\", that believed it had been mistreated by the other powers, and that was determined to achieve its rightful place by nationalistic assertiveness. He warned there may be another world war. But rather than a hot war, the two have engaged in a competition for influence in the Asian region.</p> <p>The establishment of US bases in central Asia, America's tightening defence ties with Japan and Australia, and its growing relationship with India are all seen by China's elite as part of Washington's design to keep them in check. China's response has been to bend over backwards to prove it is no threat either to the US or its neighbours. Li Junru, the vice president of the Central Party School, one of the Communist part institutions, has said the policy of heping jueqi (literally \"merging precipitously in a peaceful way\") means other nations need not fear. \"China's rise will not damage the interests of other Asian countries,\" he told the Beijing Review. \"That is because as China rises, it provides a huge market for its neighbours. At the same time, the achievements of China's development will allow it to support the progress of others in the region.\" He talks of the Chinese developing free trade areas and security organisations for the region on the model of the European Union and Nato. As part of this strategy, Beijing has resolved virtually all its land border disputes with its neighbours: it has signed a non-aggression pact with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean); it is working to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue; it is signing a treaty of friendship and cooperation with Asean which includes free trade agreements and economic aid; and it is conducting joint military exercises with Russia, Kyrgyzstan, India and Pakistan. </p> <p>The American analyst Robert W Radtke, writing in the Christian Science Monitor, argued that China's soft sell appeals to America's allies in Asia: \"China's peaceful rise was introduced to Asia by Chinese President Hu Jintao on his tour of south-east Asia in October - on the heels of President Bush's visit to the region that month. The contrast in tone between the two leaders couldn't have been more striking. In short, China's message was, 'We're here to help,' while the US message was 'You're either with us or against us' in the war on terror. It's not hard to imagine which was the more effective diplomatic strategy.\"</p> <p>But the Chinese will not push this competition too far: their biggest fear is that the neo-cons in Washington will encourage Bush to ratchet up the pressure over Taiwan, whose government has been making noises about declaring independence from the mainland, to the displeasure of the Beijing administration. Since the spat early in Bush's term when a US spy-plane crashed into a Chinese fighter, relations between the world's two leading powers have thawed. Beijing has provided Washington with useful intelligence and, like Russia, used the war on terror as an excuse to damn its own separatist movements. Even over Iraq, the Chinese supported the first UN resolution and kept a low profile over the second. During Kosovo, by contrast, Chinese spokesmen were on a 24-hour rota condemning Nato's illegal action. This time the risk of causing a rift with the Americans was judged too great. </p> <p>American policy towards China is trapped between an imperative for engagement and a preference for containment. Earlier this year US policymakers welcomed a Chinese trade delegation for a multi-billion dollar buying and spending spree, during which the Chinese were to look at making investments. Within days of the delegation's departure, however, the US threatened sanctions that would make the purchases impossible. And in the security sphere the US is seeking the People's Republic's help on the proliferation of WMD in North Korea at the same time as pushing a missile defence shield that could launch a new arms race between the two nations. </p> <p>What is becoming clear is that the Chinese are no longer easily manipulated. China's welfare is so intimately woven into the international order that its welfare affects the hope and dreams of others across the world. China is already on its way to becoming America's chief banker: the $400bn of foreign reserves it has accumulated allows the US to sustain its astronomical budget deficit. If Beijing stopped buying dollars, the US currency would collapse. The security analyst Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg has even compared the Chinese hold on the dollar to a nuclear weapon: \"Breaking the dollar would be the functional equivalent of using a nuclear weapon,\" he wrote in 2003. \"The possession of such a capability cannot be ignored by the weaker party.\" </p> <p>Because of this mutual dependence it is unlikely that Wolfowitz's predictions of world war will come true. But as China rises, the balance of power will continue to shift to the east and more and more Americans will follow Sanford's example: approaching China with a begging bowl rather than a stick. China itself will face intense pressures over the coming years - unemployment, labour unrest, environmental problems and financial problems - but any problems in the People's Republic will also threaten American interests. </p> <p>Maybe the neocons have got it wrong. Perhaps the only thing worse for the US than a China that is too strong in 2020 will be one that is too weak.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Mark Leonard is director of the Foreign Policy Centre (<a href=\"http://www.fpc.org.uk\">fpc.org.uk</a>)</p> <p><b>How China is wooing the world</b></p> <p>In my local curry house I was greeted like a long-lost friend. A huddle of young waiters gesticulated excitedly towards me. Eventually I realised they were pointing at my bag, picked up during a recent trip to China, and emblazoned with the Chinese script for Shanghai. \"You've been to China,\" they said, \"China have just put a man in space - they're taking over from America.\"</p> <p>These young Bengalis are not just motivated by regional passions. Everywhere in the developing world people are sitting up and taking notice of the Chinese juggernaut. As a model for development it is a source of inspiration, its giddy growth rates of over 8% a year lifting millions of people out of poverty. </p> <p>But even more exciting is the prospect of a new superpower that might challenge US hegemony and the American way of doing things. In a paper for the Foreign Policy Centre, Joshua Ramo, a former foreign editor at Time who is based in China, laid out the elements of a new \"Beijing consensus\", which he sees as a direct challenge to the \"Washington consensus\" that defined attitudes towards the development debate in the 1990s. Beijing is \"driven not by a desire to make bankers happy, but by the more fundamental urge for equitable, high-quality growth\", he wrote. </p> <p>China treats the ideas of privatisation and free trade with caution rather than pursuing them with zeal; the country is defined by its ruthless willingness to innovate and experiment and has created a series of \"special economic zones\" to test out new ideas. Its foreign policy is driven by a lively defence of national borders and interests (see its attitude towards Taiwan) and an increasing commitment to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, which it hopes will pin the US down. Together these policies have allowed China to grow without surrendering its independence to such financial institutions as the World Bank and IMF, global companies, or the Bush administration. </p> <p>This recipe for success is so intoxicating that, on visits to countries as diverse as Iran and South Africa, I have been drawn into discussions about the \"Chinese model of development\". China's model is seducing leaders in countries as different as Vietnam (which is taking business tips from the thoughts of the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin), Brazil (which is sending study teams to Beijing), and India (Ramgopal Agarwala, an eminent sociologist, observed: \"China's experiment should be the most admired in human history. China has its own path.\").</p> <p>Few in the west have picked up on this excitement, because they have looked at China's power simply by measuring the size of its economy or the technology of its army. But by focusing on Chinese hard power (its ability to use military force or economic might to get its way) people are missing the extraordinary rise of the country's \"soft power\" - the ability of its ideas and values to shape the world. It is an unwritten rule in the minds of the west that though China might become wealthy, it is western values and culture that will continue to define the rules of the world. </p> <p>That is already changing. For the first time there is an emerging pole that is strong enough to change the way things are done on the global stage. Japan was too small and inward-looking; India is too protectionist; Russia too weak. As China emerges as a superpower, it is desperately trying to present itself as a force for good in the world. The past few years have seen a successful Olympic bid, the creation of an English language international TV channel, a series of high-level visits by President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to key countries, and a concerted attempt to befriend not just China's neighbours but other countries as far afield as Africa and Latin America. Two centuries ago Napoleon warned China was a \"sleeping giant\" that \"once awake would astonish the world\". That prediction looks like it is about to be fulfilled.</p> <p><b>Rise of the east</b></p> <p>The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, laid down a marker for the world in April when he outlined China's ambitions in a speech to the Boao Forum for Asia. \"We will quadruple the 2,000 GDP to $4 trillion with a per capita GDP of $3,000, and further develop the economy, improve democracy, advance science and education, enrich culture, foster greater social harmony and upgrade the texture of life for the people,\" he said. </p> <p>Some in America responded positively to the remarks - former president George Bush Sr said China's peaceful rise was \"very reassuring and very, very important to the Asian horizon and Asia's landscape\" - but there are many in America who are disquieted by China's rise. Its military expenditure is rising, though it will still not compete with US defence spending and it has become increasingly bullish over Taiwan. In July, Jiang Zemin - the former president who heads China's armed forces - said China would have recovered the island by 2020. </p> <p>His remarks coincided with military exercises involving 18,000 troops, designed to demonstrate China's air superiority in the Taiwan Strait. It is also seeking to compete in space: Luan Enjie, the head of the national space programme, said last November that China intends to land a man on the moon by 2020.</p> <p>One motor of China's growth is its increasing population but with such rapid expansion come problems. Some relate to China's programme of population planning. The one-child policy has created a shortage of female babies, and the government has admitted that by 2020 China might have as many as 40 million single men, which could pose a threat to social stability.</p>",
  "<p>\"Good morning. Here is the shipping forecast for midday, June 21 2020. Seas will be calm, and visibility will range from good to excellent for the next 24 hours. The sea lanes from Bergen to Tokyo via the north-east passage will largely be free of ice, but occasional small floes may drift near the Siberian coast. The north-west passage from Europe to Fairbanks, Alaska, and Vancouver will also be clear, although iceberg hazards cannot be ruled out between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. The Bering Strait was, for the fourth time in the past decade, free of ice for the entire winter and will remain open for the rest of the summer.\"</p> <p>That's just the Arctic. By the summer of 2020, global warming will have had such devastating effect on the northern icecap that European ships may routinely cross the high latitudes to take the short routes to Asia and the Pacific. The Arctic Ocean, once frozen solid all winter and choked with hazardous floes for most of the summer, could be one of the friendlier seas. The perilous shortcuts that defied the heroic attempts of the Englishman Martin Frobisher and the Dutchman Willem Barents more than 400 years ago may soon become not just plain sailing, but the standard summer sea route from Europe to the Pacific.</p> <p>Cruise tourists and shipping magnates might wish to thank global warming. But the chances are they will not. That is because one of the Arctic's great spectacles, the polar bear, will have taken a dive: they need the sea ice to survive. For them, the ice is the way to a diet of seals, walruses and small whales. When the floes go, ursus maritimus will be on the road to extinction.</p> <p>The polar bear's base of operations has been shrinking inexorably as the planet warms. Over the past 40 years, the sheath of ice that covered the Arctic Ocean has thinned by 40%. The area covered by ice has also shrunk by more than 25%. Although much climate science is necessarily based on indirect evidence, the state of the Arctic Ocean has been monitored directly by people whose lives depend on the accuracy of their measurements. US, Russian and British nuclear submarines began charting the thickness of Arctic ice at the height of the cold war, and satellite cameras have been recording seasonal changes in ice cover for more than three decades. The conclusions are beyond dispute and the process is unstoppable. By 2020, according to the US Office of Naval Research, the north-east and north-west passages should be navigable. By 2050, according to the UK Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction, the Arctic Ocean could be free of ice in summer. </p> <p>That will happen because although the planet as a whole is warming perceptibly, the Arctic is warming eight times faster - largely because of a phenomenon called the albedo effect.</p> <p>Put simply, white reflects light, but dark absorbs it. So the sunlight crashing on to the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, the Alpine and tropical glaciers, and the snows of the great mountain chains bounces back into space. In effect, ice is its own insulator: glaciers tend to keep themselves glacial even in the summer. </p> <p>But once ice starts to melt, dark ocean or rock is exposed. That absorbs the heat, and begins to accelerate the melting process. As long as the average temperatures stay low, there is a natural brake: in high summer, snow evaporates but falls again in winter, to replace the melting ice and to keep conditions more or less stable. The problem is that things have begun to change. Glaciers in Alaska and the mountains of tropical Africa are in retreat, and climate scientists have predicted that by 2020 the snows of Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya will have vanished. </p> <p>In Europe, Alpine economies built on skiing and other mountain sports will have begun to fail. In south Asia, for at least part of the year, snow melt is the only source of water for millions of farmers. </p> <p>Adventure tourists will lose their holidays. Others stand to lose rather more. On the Indian subcontinent, half a billion people depend on the Indus and Ganges rivers, whose sources lie among melting snows of the the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram and the western Himalaya. But these great snowfields, too, are disappearing. </p> <p>All this is on the basis of an annual global average temperature rise of 0.1C a decade up to now. But it wouldn't take much to make things change faster, and those changes would be irreversible. If global average temperatures rise by more than 2.7C, according to calculations published in Nature in April, then the great sheet of ice that covers Greenland will start to melt faster than it can be replaced. The Geological Survey of Greenland and Denmark warned this summer that the ice sheet, which covers 772,000 square miles and is up to two miles thick, is melting 10 times quicker than previously thought. The sheet is thinning at 10 metres per year, not one metre. It could take 1,000 years for the sheet to completely disappear, but as it does so, sea levels will begin to rise by about 7mm a year. Once all the ice has gone, the world's oceans will have risen by around seven metres. </p> <p>This will happen, because global temperatures seem likely to rise by far more than 2.7C. Ten years ago, the UN's Intercontinental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) set up to study global warming proposed a maximum temperature rise of about 3C by 2100. Three years ago, IPCC revised that prediction. The maximum temperature rise during the present century is set at almost 6C. And the predicted maximum temperature rise for Greenland is put at up to 8C. </p> <p>That is not the only danger posed by the thawing of the world's cold places. The Arctic regions are rimmed by permafrost: regions of tundra that enjoy an urgent spring, a brief, brilliant summer and then a long, hostile winter. These landscapes hold stores of ancient carbon and methane in the form of decaying vegetation imprisoned for 10,000 years or more. Once the permafrost starts to melt, awesome quantities of carbon dioxide and methane - two potent greenhouse gases - will be released from thawing peat bogs to accelerate the warming process yet further. This climate phenomenon is known as \"positive feedback\". </p> <p>By 2020, then, the Arctic will have begun to change for ever. The adventure tales of the past will be distant history: stories of explorers fighting their way by sled across the perilous frozen seas will be science fiction to young readers and nostalgic yearnings for a lost world to their parents. </p> <p>\"Here is the long-term weather forecast for the tropical and temperate zones at midday, June 21 2020. After a series of increasingly wet winters, northern Europe could once again be at risk of a lethal heat wave. Forest fires are raging in the Iberian Peninsula, southern France and the Balkans. Water rationing has once again been imposed in California. Relief agencies have warned that late rains raise the spectre of widespread hunger in the Sahel and southern Africa. Bangladesh, however, is once more preparing for catastrophic floods.\"</p> <p>It's a matter of simple physics: a warmer world means a rising sea level. Warm water is less dense than cold, so some of the sea level rise will happen just because the water already in the oceans has begun to expand. But sea levels have begun to rise still further with the melting of continental ice and the retreat of the glaciers. The effects of the rise will only slowly become apparent - even the most pessimistic predictions suggest that by 2100 the sea level will only be a metre higher - but even at that slow rate many millions of people will be imperilled. Sea level rise is a threat to anybody who lives at or a fraction above sea level, and especially to citizens of those countries classed as developing. That, of course, means poor. </p> <p>For such people, the future looks very bleak. There are 54 members of the Commonwealth. Only six of these are classed as developed nations. Around 93% of the Commonwealth lives in the other 48. Some of these countries may have no future at all. \"If the scientific forecasts prove correct, then by the end of the century membership of the Commonwealth will have declined because two or three nations will have disappeared,\" warned Clive Hamilton, director of the Australian Institute, in September 2003. Two Commonwealth states - the Maldives and Tuvalu - are at risk of complete submersion by 2080. Two other groups of islands - Kiribati and the Bahamas - will be in a bad way, because almost all their territories lie below the four-metre mark. </p> <p>Each of those states will already be facing periodic devastation and permanent crisis by 2020. The bedrock of many of the islands is coral limestone. Coral is a living thing, so if sea levels were to rise slowly enough - over 1,000 rather than 100 years - then coral could grow to keep up with the water levels. But coral is extremely sensitive to rising temperatures: the corals that make up most reefs and atolls are already at the limits of their temperature tolerance. Those reefs near human settlements are choked by man-made pollutants, and their ecologies have been permanently altered by intensive fishing. </p> <p>Any increase in ocean temperatures means death by bleaching - the corals turn white and die. This has happened a number of times in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Great Barrier Reef near Australia, with cyclical rises in water temperatures. Those rises have been followed by cyclical falls, so the corals have had the chance to recover. But global warming means permanent heating, and the living corals that support life - both human and non-human - in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are expected to perish on a massive scale. </p> <p>The coral won't be the only thing to suffer. The oceans will seep into the bedrock, polluting the subterranean fresh water. Agriculture will become impossible, supplies of drinking water will be minimal and as the waters rise the islands will start to drown in seawater.</p> <p>Island dwellers, of course, will not be the only ones at risk. Hundreds of millions of people in densely populated countries with low-lying coastal plains or vast estuaries will come under threat from rising sea levels. According to Sir John Houghton, a former director of the UK Met Office and author of Global Warming: The Complete Briefing, a sea level rise of half a metre could sweep away or make uninhabitable about 10% of the habitable land of Bangladesh. That land is currently home to at least six million people. Sea levels will not need to rise by half a metre worldwide to make this happen: the delta region of Bangladesh is subsiding, partly because groundwater is being abstracted for agriculture to feed the nation's 140 million citizens. </p> <p>By 2050, waters could have risen by a metre, claiming 20% of Bangladesh and displacing 15 million people. By 2100, the ocean may have encroached up the rivers almost as far as Dhaka, one of the world's fastest growing cities, and across the Indian border to the edge of Calcutta. </p> <p>A glance around the world shows the same pattern being repeated again and again. In Egypt, a metre rise in the Mediterranean will mean the fertile lands of the Nile delta will disappear beneath the sea, claiming 12% of the country's arable land and displacing seven million people. A sea level rise of half a metre would also cause havoc in the Netherlands and in the Mississippi delta. But the difference between those two regions and those in the developing world is that the Dutch and the Americans already spend money on sea defences and can afford more. In China, a half-metre rise in the sea level could inundate the alluvial plains of the eastern coast, covering an area of land the size of the Netherlands, leaving 30 million homeless. </p> <p>And if the sea doesn't get you, the storms will. Hurricanes and cyclones are freak events whose existence is controlled by sea temperatures. If the surface temperature of the ocean is below 26.5C, typhoons, tropical cyclones and hurricanes hardly happen. But with each rise of the mercury beyond that point they become more frequent and more ferocious. Savage storms, and the sea surges they bring, will pose huge threats to small island states and could scour low-lying land completely clear. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, climate scientists warned that in a greenhouse world, the kind of fierce storms that had been once-a-century occurrences would come around every decade. The fatal combination of very high tide and tropical cyclone has hit Bangladesh and the Bengal coast of India many times. In 1991, one such storm surge claimed an estimated 139,000 lives. In 1970, another killed 300,000 people. UN researchers warned in June that an estimated one billion people live in the path of the kind of flood that used to occur every 100 years: by 2050, the number of potential victims could reach two billion.</p> <p>If two billion people are at risk of dramatic inundation in 2020, around 2.3 billion others living in the world's water-poor nations could face an even more wretched future. They will see increasingly parched landscapes, empty wells, polluted lakes and rivers that run dry. UN experts calculated that in 2000, people in 30 nations faced water shortages. By 2020, they predict, that number will have risen to 50 nations. </p> <p>As temperatures rise, more water will evaporate, but rainfall will remain capricious. Countries in the monsoon belt will face more severe droughts in the dry season but could also have to deal with more catastrophic flooding. Other regions - the southern Mediterranean, north Africa, southern Africa and the Sahel - could become even more arid, with olive groves succumbing to desertification. The great plains of North America, the breadbasket for the planet, could turn again into a dustbowl, delivering less and less grain to a world that acquires an extra 240,000 mouths to feed every single day. </p> <p>The pattern of falling crop yields will be seen all over the planet. They are expected to decline by at least 10% in most African Commonwealth countries, and by even more in Mozambique, Tanzania, Botswana and Namibia. There could also be dramatic falls in food production in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, although harvests could increase by 10% in Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Papua New Guinea. Canada and New Zealand could also see dramatic increases in crop yields but Australia, already largely arid, will be one of the economic losers. </p> <p>And forget the glib remarks about the one good side-effect of global warming being decent summers. In 2003, more than 20,000 people died in northern Europe because of a heat wave that saw Germany roasting in its hottest temperatures for 450 years. Climate scientists believe that if atmospheric warming continues unchecked, such heat waves can be expected every 20 years or so - so expect summer 2020 to be every bit as oppressive as last year. </p> <p>\"The summer of 2003 was a summer of the future,\" said Gerhard Berz, head of natural risks research at Munich Re, one of the insurance giants that has to calculate hazard and pick up the bill for floods, heat waves, ice storms, hurricanes, forest fires and droughts. </p> <p>Global warming is expected to bring good news for some. But right now it looks like it will be delivering bad news to most people by 2020. The IPCC, the international consortium of climate scientists that has delivered increasingly urgent warnings since it was established in 1988, is that rare thing: a group of scientists who would love to be proved wrong. Their predictions have been made in the hope that governments will take action, and in doing so direct the planet towards a less fearful future. There is evidence that governments have been listening. </p> <p>Action, however, has been slow. Acting now would be too late to avert the challenges of 2020. We are starting to see the effects of carbon emissions of a few decades ago: your fuel-efficient small car is an investment in the future, because we're currently paying for that great gas guzzler your family was driving in the 70s. Every cook who knows a bit about science understands a concept called thermal inertia: the gas is on full, but the kettle takes a few minutes to boil, and though the gas is off, it takes a while to cool down. We're still waiting for the earth to start simmering, but by 2020 the bubbles will be appearing, whatever we do today. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tim Radford is the Guardian's science editor</p> <p><strong>Can we predict the weather?</strong></p> <p>As Sam Goldwyn said, prediction is always difficult, especially of the future. There are huge uncertainties in climate forecasting. The planet is a complicated place: its climate is influenced by the interplay of sunlight, atmosphere, dust, ocean currents and rainfall; by the temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles; by the topography of continents; by the balance of forests, wetlands, deserts, savannahs and oceans, as well as by the chemistry and biochemistry of the seas. </p> <p>To grasp the patterns of the future, climate scientists have to know the pattern of climate change in the past. That means they have to examine the indirect evidence provided by ice cores, tree rings, coral growths, and mud samples from oceans and lakes in order to estimate greenhouse gas levels and average temperatures in the distant past. Then they must monitor the oceans, the upper and lower atmosphere, and weather patterns around the whole planet to understand the mechanics of climate now. Only then can they start composing computer models of what might happen the day after tomorrow. So when politicians - and, sometimes, other scientists - make accusations of uncertainty, speculation and possible error, they have a point. There is no doubt the planet is warming, but how much of that is caused by some natural cycle nobody yet understands? And how much is the result of human interference? And what will humans do in the future that might make conditions better or worse? </p> <p>Atmospheric chemists say they understand the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, quite well. But methane, though shorter-lived, is an even more potent greenhouse gas: what role could it play in the future? Water vapour, too, is a greenhouse gas: a warmer world means more water vapour in the atmosphere. Will it make the world an even hotter place? Or will it mean greater cloud cover, which might then act as a brake on global warming by cutting out more sunlight? Those questions are unanswered and the debate goes on. </p> <p>Through 15 years of intensive climate study, however, the broad message from the scientists has remained much the same. They are now convinced that indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels is steadily increasing the global average atmospheric temperature. And the only way to halt or at least slow global warming would be to make dramatic cuts in carbon emissions. Which leads to the other great unanswered question: can we meet that challenge? <strong>TR</strong></p> <p><strong>Earth blows hot and cold</strong></p> <p>Earth's climate has always been subject to ups and downs, and there is nothing novel about a warm Arctic. Ninety million years ago, during the Cretaceous era, deciduous forests stretched into the Arctic circle, and carnivorous dinosaurs roamed Antarctica. Five years ago, palaeontologists uncovered the bones of an eight-foot champosaur, a reptile with a crocodile-like snout and razor-sharp teeth, under the Alaskan snows. Such a creature could only have survived in a warmer world, and experts calculate that the average annual temperature in Alaska must have been 14C. That is, it may never have frozen, even in the coldest winters. </p> <p>The globe can blow both hot and cold: much earlier, glaciers reached almost to the equator. Some climate scientists have hypothesised a \"snowball Earth\" - a completely frozen world - for at least four spells between 750m years ago and 580m years ago, before things warmed up again. </p> <p>Human civilisation is generally adapted to a cooler world. Around 21,000 years ago, during the height of the last ice age, sea levels were 135 metres lower than they are today, and the continents were covered by an extra 52 million cubic kilometres of ice. The interglacial thaw that took place 11,000 years ago gave agriculture, metalwork and urban civilisation its kickstart. </p> <p>For a while back in the 1970s some climate scientists wondered about the possibility of an imminent return of the ice age. And earlier this year, European scientists drilling in the Antarctic settled an answer to that question. The evidence from the ice cores suggests that, even if carbon dioxide levels were normal, there could still be another 15,000 years before the glaciers return to southern England. </p> <p>But carbon dioxide levels are not normal. They're rising and they're rising fast. The evidence from the same ice cores confirms that both temperatures and carbon dioxide levels are now higher than at any time in the last 400,000 years. The evidence from fossil plankton drilled from the seabed tells an even more ominous story: carbon dioxide levels are higher than at any time in the last 20m years. And they are expected to double in the coming century. That means higher temperatures, for longer - and it means that any existing forecasts of a new ice age are likely to be way off course. <strong>TR</strong></p>",
  "<b>Central Africa</b> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>Over recent decades, central Africa has seen a series of bitter and bloody civil wars and a genocide, with millions dying or uprooted. Because the roots of these conflicts spill over national boundaries, the security of the central African nations is interlinked; any dramatic deterioration in this interlinked security during the next 20 years could mean the virtual collapse of central governments in the region. If that happens by 2020, anarchy could have spread through the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda and Congo. </p> <p>The neighbouring countries will then also face deepening insecurity as refugees pour over their borders. Expect more of the same chilling stories we have seen in recent years: reports of mass rape, kidnapping, and forced recruitment drives taking men and boys off the land and into armed rebel factions.</p> <p>The DRC would be the centre of this regional political and security vacuum, but intervention would be impossible. Given the level of lawlessness, forces under the mandate of the UN, the EU or the African Union would become targets of ambushes or kidnappings by increasingly reckless and confident armed groups. As a result central Africa could become, as parts of eastern DRC and Sudan are now, a no-go area for outsiders, making it impossible to deliver the humanitarian aid that would be desperately needed.</p> <p>A circular process of dedevelopment could engulf the whole region. If war becomes a permanent state, it will destroy hopes of improved health and education, and reverse the gains of the post-colonial years of the late 20th century. If millions are unable to access any sort of modern healthcare, rampant malaria will run unchecked and could kill tens of thousands, especially babies and small children. Dengue fever and sleeping sickness would attack all sectors of the population, while the failure of inoculation programmes for children would mean epidemics of measles and the probable re-emergence of diseases such as polio. The constant war would also have the side effect of causing HIV/Aids to spread faster than ever: it would be transmitted through the migration of impoverished people forced into refugee status and through the use of rape as a weapon of war (this would be a militarised culture in which powerless women are despised and men live outside any traditional community except their shifting armed groups). The most productive section of society would be hardest hit by deaths from Aids, which in turn would tighten the cycle of poverty. With health disasters piling on the population one after another, life expectancy could drop as low as 30 to 35, and households headed by children or old men and women would be the norm. Those kind of family groupings do not have the strength to cultivate land, and they will be forced into the most marginal subsistence agriculture, or, in some places in DRC, dangerous artisan mining of diamonds, gold and coltan. Girls would be compelled to join the sex trade to survive in the corrupt, swollen mega cities. </p> <p>After years of warfare, a generation of uneducated youth would know only the brutalised life of the gun, meaning that the gulf between the political elite of the countries and the rest of the population would be wider than ever. The possibility of moving any part of the region towards democracy might disappear for generations. The civilian brain drain would worsen, depriving the civic culture and leaving the military in the ascendant. That would set the stage for new dictatorial regimes as debased as those of Idi Amin in Uganda, or Mobutu Sese Seko in the former Zaire. Africa's standing in the rest of the world would be completely debased, and African writers and artists would no longer be portraying life in the continent, only life in exile. </p> <p>Would the US seek to make its presence felt to help guarantee security? Yes, but only out of self-interest. With regional war on the horizon, the US would quickly upgrade its warm relations with Uganda and establish a permanent military base for the region, in order to maintain access to the oil reserves of southern Sudan. Like other western governments, however, it will have given up on the people of the region.</p> <p> <b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>In 2020 central Africa could be a completely different place, where the warlords and kleptocrats of the present day would be nothing but historical curiosities, and where new visionary leadership, much of it female, could lead the continent in transformed relations with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Under this leadership, arms sales to Africa would be banned by the newly invigorated African Union, and the war zones of central Africa would begin to hold regular competitions for the biggest and longest burning bonfires of small arms. The spark for this would be a major western political figure - perhaps Gordon Brown - taking the initiative in the very near future and persuading the G8 to cancel Africa's debt and remove all agricultural subsidies in Europe and the US, providing equal access to EU and US markets. The 2004 annual global figure of $300bn in subsidies to farmers in the rich nations would be abolished. And if the European leaders would make the leap to fight terrorism by first fighting poverty and injustice, that money could be put into the weakest states in the world - many of them in central Africa.</p> <p>Massive funding for health and education would then pour into the continent, especially into central Africa's former war zones. New HIV/Aids vaccines could prevent a disastrous shift in the demographics of Africa and successfully arrest the decline of the productive age group, ensuring the the region would not lose their farmers, teachers and nurses.</p> <p>Education funding on an unprecedented scale would be a priority. By 2020 it might at last be recognised that UN and aid agency piecemeal projects to eliminate illiteracy have failed postwar societies. What Africa's new generations really need is tertiary education if they are to create both civil societies and a political class able to make an impact in the wider world. That could be achieved with a mass of new initiatives planned in the region and funded from outside. Devices such as twinning African universities with western universities and increased use of distance learning for African students could be the fashionable causes for western academic institutions. The judicious use of targeted funding could also address the long-standing problem of the brain drain. The combination of political stability and money could lure back those who have left and keep those who had planned to leave. If that can be achieved, by 2020 central Africa would have leaders capable of transforming the region. With secure, democratic governments free of corruption, the rule of law could become a priority. Warlords would be delivered to the International Criminal Court to stand trial for their war crimes. At home there would be trials for corruption, truth commissions would be established, and governments would be able to compensate survivors.</p> <p>If Africa, aided by resources from the rich countries, can manage two decades of building skills, free and open communication, and pluralist politics, we can hope by 2020 for the growth of a confident political class unlike any since the first years of independence from colonialism, when Congo's Patrice Lumumba was the region's hero. The impact of these leaders on international bodies such as the UN, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the IMF could help produce by 2020 the new world order so elusive over the previous half century.</p> <p> <b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>By 2020 central Africa will be divided into two types of country. In failing states, such as DRC, large areas of the country will be out of contact and control of the weak central authority. But two decades of strong and visionary leaders in states such as Rwanda and Tanzania will lead to huge investment in education and technology in those countries, which will have emerged as regional leaders. They'll also be recognised across as the first countries to transcend ethnic politics, which will be widely considered old-fashioned and destructive.</p> <p>In these flourishing countries the population will be moving out of poverty. New computer-based industries will provide work for the educated, as has already happened in Bangalore and Chennai. Ecotourism will be a magnet for high-spending foreigners and bring infrastructure and income to rural areas. The brain drain to the west will be a forgotten phenomenon, and the universities will be linked to the best specialised departments across the world.</p> <p>The west will have long since cancelled Africa's debt, and vastly increased aid will flow to the continent. And the agricultural subsidies to western farmers that used to be thought an essential part of European and American domestic politics will seem a curious piece of old history. But in places where the leadership is weak and lacks vision, the new external resources will not have been enough to break the cycle of poverty.</p> <p>Violence will still hold sway, and poor education and poor health - especially the scourge of HIV/Aids - will still cripple the population. In these countries, life expectancy will be the lowest in the world. Ethnic loyalties will still be the determining factor in politics, and a ready supply of small arms into the region means armed factions will still control many areas in shifting alliances with each other, leaving the populations as desperately insecure and poor as they are now. The rich natural resources of those countries will not enable them to escape this bleak future. Outsiders will control the rich mining areas of DRC and the oil wealth of southern Sudan, and the profits will flow out of Africa as they have for centuries.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Victoria Brittain has worked on Africa since 1975 and lived in several African countries, some as the Guardian's correspondent</p> <p><b>Middle East</b></p> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>The US will blame Iranian interference for the turmoil in Iraq and will launch military strikes against the Tehran regime. Resistance to the US will stiffen in Iran and among Shia Muslims across the region: Shia rebellions could break out in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Anarchy in Iraq will give Kurds the excuse they need to declare independence and foment a Kurdish uprising in Syria.</p> <p>The \"war on terror\" will destroy al-Qaida as an organisation but it will not dampen Islamist militancy. Its greatest effect will be to spawn hundreds of small autonomous groups that prove impossible to monitor. </p> <p>The Yemeni elections of 2009 will prove to be the last in the Arab world as governments backtrack on democracy, blaming the deteriorating security situation. The EU will deal with that same problem by approving a Middle East stability pact that lifts all restrictions on weapon sales to regimes that are deemed to be combating terrorism.</p> <p>The threat of Islamist terror will continue to spread beyond the Arab world. London will face its gravest threat when an Islamist group threatens to explode a dirty nuclear device unless Britain stops supporting \"Arab lackeys of Zionism and Crusaderism\". There will be no progress towards peace with Israel, so the Palestinians will abandon their claim for a separate state and demand equal rights with Israeli citizens. </p> <p>By 2015, the UN will have accepted a plan to divide the whole of historic Palestine into a series of Jewish and Arab cantons, but it will not end the conflict. By 2020, Nato forces sent to implement the plan will still be struggling to impose peace in the face of stiff resistance from extremists on both sides.</p> <p><b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>The Arab-Israeli conflict will end by 2008 with the creation of a viable Palestinian state, and a peace treaty between Israel and Syria. All the Arab states, plus Iran, will then recognise Israel and exchange ambassadors. Talks can begin on ridding the Middle East of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and by 2012 UN inspectors will be able to declare the region a WMD-free zone.</p> <p>Peace with Israel would remove one of the main driving forces behind Islamic militancy in the region, which would in turn lead to a decline in terrorism. Political reform throughout the region would also follow peace, since Arab leaders would no longer be able to blame Israel for their countries' problems.</p> <p>Iraq will avert civil war and stay in one piece - but only just. Amid the chaos left by its elected civilian government, the return to military rule later this decade will be greeted with widespread relief. By 2020, the Iraqi regime will still be promising elections \"next year or as soon as the situation permits\".</p> <p>Elsewhere, the strategy of gradual but steady reform is largely successful. By 2020, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states will have become constitutional monarchies, while Yemen, Egypt and Syria will have all held elections that - for the first time - result in changes of government. In Africa, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia will be readying themselves to join the EU, probably by 2030. Libya, which could be the Mediterranean's fastest-growing tourist destination by 2020, will remain politically eccentric: all government decisions will be made by citizens voting on the net.</p> <p><b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>How will Iraq be faring in 2020? It will be a toss-up between rule by Saddam Lite (authoritarianism with American blessing) and the fragmentation of the state. The underlying conflicts over religion and ethnicity will take years to play out - probably through violence, unless a strong national leader emerges. Continued instability in Iraq will harm all its neighbours.</p> <p>But that does not mean the region will have been dragged into continual conflict. By 2020 there will be a new generation of Arabs who have known satellite TV and the internet all their lives; the significance of that should not be underestimated. So far, globalised media has achieved three things in the Middle East: it has engaged ordinary Arabs in international politics in a way that was impossible before; it has given them a view of western lifestyles that some covet and others reject; and it has given them a sense of common Muslim/Arab identity that cuts across borders and the nationalism of individual states.</p> <p>The belief that Arabs and Muslims are victims of American and Israeli designs is almost universal in the Middle East, as is the feeling that the current leaders are powerless to do anything about it. One response - the dominant one at present - is Islamist militancy, but there are others, especially among the urban young, who want to be like the rest of the world. Among religious believers, too, there are many who privately question the confrontational, backward-looking interpretations of Islamists.</p> <p>There is a chance that, by 2020, the fundamentalist trend will have peaked and that new, more progressive interpretations of Islam will have begun to emerge. The idea that Arab/Muslim societies can survive as islands of cultural authenticity or religious purity in a globalised world is nothing but pure fantasy. Today, Saudi censors go through every imported newspaper, obliterating \"undesirable\" material while millions of Saudi citizens are able to watch whatever takes their fancy on satellite television. </p> <p>Moves towards a form of Islam that is more compatible with modern life will also be reflected in social and political changes. The need here is not for cosmetic democracy but for ideas of tolerance and openness to take hold, for accountability and transparency in public life, and for political parties based on policies rather than tribal, ethnic or religious allegiances.</p> <p>It's a tall order, but it will have to happen sometime. The two factors most likely to hold it back are American policies towards the region and continued conflict with Israel. It is difficult to imagine that Israeli voters, at some point before 2020, will not weary of the strategy pursued by their present government and decide that there has to be a better way. </p> <p>Whether American voters will reach the same conclusion is more doubtful. The old, confrontational cold war themes play well with American voters when reapplied to the Arab and Muslim world, but don't really serve American interests. The best thing the US can do for the Middle East over the next 16 years is stop prescribing solutions and ask: \"Is there anything we can do to help?\" It should also not be too offended when the reply is \"Yes. Please go away.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Brian Whitaker is the Guardian's Middle East editor</p> <p><b>Kashmir</b></p> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>India and Pakistan's rivalry over Kashmir could, by 2020, have finally have erupted into a nuclear exchange that might leave 100 million people dead and lay waste to half a million square kilometres of rich agricultural land in Asia. The roots of such a disaster would lie in a series of political miscalculations and in chronic economic mismanagement.</p> <p>The main problem will be the two neighbours refusing to make the tough decisions required for peace. Political misjudgments would see India failing to realise its potential as an economic powerhouse, with successive governments introducing policies that favour the rise of a small urban elite, rather than lifting the fortunes of the rural poor. This could spark armed insurrection among the poor of northern and eastern India. The Maoist rebellion in Nepal would exacerbate the problem, providing ideological coherence from the Himalaya to the plains of India.</p> <p>Governance will be a thing of the past in many of India's large northern and eastern states. The country's southern regions, which have their own distinctive culture and languages, will begin to agitate for a form of independence. The north will react differently to the political chaos, electing a hardline Hindu nationalist leadership that would stress national unity. Its plea would fail. The Indian union will unravel if a south Indian fiscal union is formed between Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh and Karnataka. These four wealthy states, with close ties to the hi-tech US defence industry and burgeoning software industries, might refuse to subsidise the central government and the north, leading to a major political crisis.</p> <p>In Pakistan, the modernisers will lose out to the religious zealots by 2010 after Nato ends all its operations in Afghanistan. The military, in effect, will become the armed wing of a theocracy - one armed with a nuclear bomb. This fundamentalist state would begin to neglect education and would do little to stem the rise of Islamic institutes, preferring instead to produce an army of willing volunteers for jihad in Kashmir and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Religion would not be a strong enough glue for the nation. The simmering tension between the states of Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab would begin to boil over. The argument will be that Punjab's plains soak up most of Pakistan's water and its industry consumes most of the country's coal, depriving other states. Militant groups would declare independence in Sindh and Balochistan and begin targeting Punjabi officials. Pakistan's civil war would have begun.</p> <p>In Kashmir, the issue of water is going to be crucial. The three rivers that feed Pakistan - the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - run through Indian Kashmir. With the water table of Pakistan decreasing and north-west India facing shortages, the two nations will abrogate their mutual water treaty by 2015. America might by then have decided that an independent Kashmir is the answer and arm insurgency groups via China. And by then Kashmir will have become a killing field, with Indian and Pakistani-backed fighters engaged in open warfare. This war in Kashmir, Pakistan's anarchy and political chaos in India will turn the region into a live bomb: all that would be needed is someone to light the fuse. Kashmir will be the excuse, not the reason. But by this point apocalypse will be inevitable; the world will have seen its first case of mutually assured destruction.</p> <p><b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>By 2020 no one will believe that almost 20 years before, Pakistan and India were poised in a nuclear stand-off over the then restive Kashmir, which will have become the tranquil tourist haven of Kashmir Autonomous Region.</p> <p>The turning point was the summer of 2002, which marked the end of history for the region. Not long after, the leaders of the two nations began to escape from the prison of the past. India and Pakistan made the commitment to develop friendly relations and leave the settlement of the Kashmir question to the diplomatic process which began this year. </p> <p>The factor that will lead to peace is the realisation of the leadership of both countries that neither can win militarily. That, and the emergence of a new South Asian Union (SAU) as a single economic area, which will grease the development of sound bilateral relations. Instead of Hindu nationalism and Islamic chauvinism, leaders in both countries would then opt for good governance and development.</p> <p>The simple fact is that to house, feed and provide jobs for ever-growing populations, both India and Pakistan need to start working together. By making social and economic policies the priority for government, rather than nurturing nationalism, both will lift tens of millions out of poverty. Trade will be the proving ground of the new relationship. If the energy-hungry metropolises of the subcontinent can be supplied by pipelines from Iran and Turkmenistan, then both countries will stand to benefit. Islamabad will gain wealth from transit fees while India will be able to buy cheap energy. The two countries will discover that trade is a game of mutual interests, where both will be able to seek and gain benefit. Delhi will allow Pakistani goods to travel by road to reach south-east Asia. In return Islamabad will open transit routes to central Asia for Indian wares.</p> <p>The cultural and religious antagonisms between India and Pakistan will then fade, reducing the need for perpetual war-footing. No longer will their people consider each other to be in the grip of obscurantist preachers and zealots. They will be too busy setting up factories, rediscovering lost relatives and friends on the other side of the border, as well as taking holidays in hill stations and balmy sunspots. The signing of a nuclear-arms reduction treaty between India and Pakistan will also reduce tensions, and China will play a key role, aware that nuclear war in its backyard will hamper its own peaceful rise.</p> <p>In Kashmir, under the guidance of an American peace envoy, a ceasefire will be in place by 2007. The Indian army will finally withdraw from the Kashmir Valley and Delhi can then address the human rights violations perpetrated since the insurgency began in 1989. Pakistan, too, will end its shadowy intelligence operations and close down militant camps in Kashmir. Home-grown armed separatists can then move towards the use of the ballot box, not the bullet.</p> <p>If a settlement is reached, the pace of change could be so fast that the problem will be not peace, but deciding what follows peace. Kashmir's complicated geography and the fact its territory is fractured along the fault lines of national identity and state allegiance mean there would be no easy answers. There are minorities who would fight for the status quo as viciously as they would for independence.</p> <p>To defuse these tensions will require a peace plan that first devolves power from Islamabad and Delhi to the state capitals of the two halves of Kashmir. Also elections in Pakistani and Indian Kashmir would allow representation from all political shades. The border would remain but crossing it would require no travel documents. By 2020, a single Kashmir political entity could be a reality, in one of the world's most tense and bitter rivalries.</p> <p><b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>The concept of a separate Kashmiri identity is going to disappear over the next 16 years, as the independence movement is submerged by the crashing waves of Indian and Pakistani nationalism. Kashmir will be simply carved into two by both countries, with China being handed the mountainous portion its army has occupied for decades. India and Pakistan will accept the deal, and the people of Kashmir will pay the price. Lacking an inspirational leader, Kashmiris will be unable to tell the world of their plight.</p> <p>The likely sop to the Kashmiri people will be a form of travel documents which both India and Pakistan will pledge to upgrade, eventually, into passports. Talk of a cross-border Kashmiri parliament will come to nothing: all that is likely to happen is a regular meeting of Indian and Pakistani-appointed politicians. Such a Kashmir settlement would not be accepted by separatists on either side of the border, but they will be unable to mobilise resistance. A joint Indo-Pakistan covert military operation will pick off the militant leaders and simply repress all forms of dissent. </p> <p>The reason for the diminishing importance of Kashmir in both national psyches is that both countries simply have more to lose than to gain over the issue. Pakistan will in time come to realise its primary advantage over India lies in its geopolitical location, which gives it access to the huge and growing market across the border. It will be in both countries' interests to agree a nuclear no-first-use pact, probably sponsored by the Americans</p> <p>The two countries will also be brought closer by the movement towards a south Asian common market. When an agreement to establish a SAU is finally signed in 2015, the region's legal and economic institutions will be forced to improve their services and, to some extent, harmonise their activities. The SAU would have to grant Kashmir special status, but to tempt investors restrictions on land acquisitions will be lifted, leading to a buy up by big business. That will mean the arrival of a migrant workforce for Kashmir's new industrial sector. The distinctive character of the region will start to fade, just like Tibet since its annexation by China.</p> <p>A less confrontational relationship between India and Pakistan will mean that by 2020 the shadow of conflict will no longer hang over south Asia.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Randeep Ramesh is the Guardian's south Asia correspondent</p>",
  "In Iraq his nickname was Hoshyar, meaning \"awake\". Like others opposed to Saddam Hussein's regime, he adopted it so that the authorities would not know his real identity. Kalan Kawa Karim was given the name because he was always on guard, always looking behind him. When he came to the UK just over two years ago, he stopped using it; here he would not have to be awake all the time; he could drop his defences, he would be safe. But he wasn't. <p>In the early hours of Monday morning the man who had escaped torture in Iraq was hit on the head from behind in a Swansea street. His assailant felled him with just one heavy blow, leaving him dying on the pavement. </p> <p>Mr Karim, 29, had been in Swansea for 18 months. When he lived in the Kurdish town of Dohuq in northern Iraq he was a political activist fighting the Saddam regime, but he was caught and shot in the leg. </p> <p>During his three years in prison the leg became infected, because the authorities refused to treat him, and eventually it had to be amputated. In Britain he walked with a prosthetic limb. </p> <p><b> Released</b></p> <p>Deciding to seek asylum, he left Iraq as soon as he was released from prison. Living first in Middlesbrough, he was granted refugee status, and he moved to Swansea because his uncle and a friend lived there. Six months later his brother Nazar joined him. But his wife remained in Iraq. </p> <p>Recently he had been talking about going back to join her. </p> <p>In Britain there was not much for Mr Karim to do, since his artificial limb and poor English made him largely unemployable. Life was mostly spent in the ninth-floor flat he shared with his brother and friends. Time did not really mean much, and at 12.30am on Monday he left the flat with his friend Ahmad to go to pick up a pizza. </p> <p>The men walked to King Pin Pizza in Kingsway, an area of Swansea with the reputation of being \"rough\" at night: it is lined with clubs and bars with names such as Zanzi Ba and Iso Ba. </p> <p>Of all of them, the Potter's Wheel is the biggest. Here, signs in the window offer \"free mixers with all spirits\", G&amp;T at 99p and pints of Guinness and Carling at \u00a31.49. At 4.30pm there is not a seat to be found at the dozens of tables inside. Nor are there any black faces. It was round the back of here, at 1.30am, that Mr Karim was attacked. Now a few bunches of carnations are tied to a lamp post to mark the spot. </p> <p>There are almost 200 Iraqi Kurds living in Swansea, all of them gathering with other Muslims at the local mosque to say al-Fatiha, a verse from the Qur'an, in Mr Karim's honour. Amid the grief, there is anger. </p> <p>The police have said they believe Mr Karim was killed because of the colour of his skin. </p> <p>But the police and others are keen to point out that it is an isolated incident. </p> <p>Mr Karim's friends and family disagree. His uncle Tahseen Shaho, 34, a refugee who has lived in Swansea for two years, wipes tears from his eyes. He said: \"I feel like all around me are murderers and animals, like in a safari. Karim thought that he would come to a civilised society where people respect human rights and respect other people's right to life. </p> <p>\"These people are worse than Saddam. In Iraq, you know who your enemy is. Here, you never know who is going to hit you in the back. I think that his killer was a coward. </p> <p>\"We didn't think we would have to do it here, but in this society, when you are foreign you have to look behind you all the time to see who is there. I feel responsible for his death, because I was the oldest relative here and the family were always asking me to keep an eye on him.\" </p> <p>Mr Karim's best friend, Sarkat Junad, also feels responsible. \"When he was in Middlesbrough he phoned me and asked me what it was like in Swansea. I said it was a nice city. He didn't really ask me what the people were like, otherwise I would have told him I don't really like it as a city because we get so much abuse here.\" </p> <p><b>Team</b></p> <p>Mr Junad runs a football team called Swansea World Star, whose players are mostly asylum seekers. All of them, he says, have experienced problems in Swansea. </p> <p>\"Ask any Iraqi Kurd if they have been abused in any incident, and each of them would have experienced one or two. We had a problem last year when they brought around 60 Iraqi asylum seekers and it was all over the papers. Once they see us and the way we look, they think straight away, Iraqi.\" </p> <p>Now the family are awaiting the return of Mr Karim's body. They will take him back to Iraq. </p> <p>His best friend shakes his head and thinks of the old nickname. \"He became Karim again because he didn't think he had to be awake all the time. When you think you are living in a civilised democracy, then you think that you are safe. But somebody hit him from behind. It was hatred.\"</p>",
  "It began nearly three years ago in the early hours of December 19 2001. Nine men were removed from their homes across the country by dozens of police officers and taken to Belmarsh and Woodhill high security prisons. Their families were not told where they were until much later. All non-UK nationals - from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia - the men were certified as \"suspected international terrorists\" under a new law passed only days before, the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act (ATCSA), whereby the home secretary requires only \"reasonable belief\" that those detained are a threat to national security. The men cannot be identified because to do so might put their families at risk here and in their home countries. They have been in prison now for years, without charge, without trial and with no prospect of release. To allow for this, Britain had to renege on the section of the European convention of human rights stipulating no detention without trial - the only country out of 40 to have done so. <p>By now, 17 foreign nationals in all have been certified. Of those, 13 are being detained; one has been released on bail but may not leave his home; two have left the UK; and one has been released after a successful appeal. The detainees occupy small cells, 3m by 1.8m, for 22 hours a day, rarely see daylight and are strip-searched each time they are visited (a particular humiliation for devout Muslim men). Gareth Peirce, of Birnberg Peirce solicitors, who represents all but two of the men, says that they have been \"entombed in concrete\". Amnesty International describes the indefinite detentions without trial as \"a Guant\u00e1namo in our own back yard\", and conditions at Belmarsh as \"cruel, inhuman and degrading\". </p> <p>Not even their solicitors can establish why these men have been detained - the evidence, for reasons of national security, cannot be disclosed. The men are in a surreal legal no man's land specific to foreign nationals: they cannot be tried because there is not enough evidence against them; although labelled suspected terrorists, they are free to leave Britain; but they cannot be deported because they face persecution, torture or death in their countries of origin (the reason so few have opted to leave Britain voluntarily). All the detainees have to go on is the statements made in open sessions of a review at the Special Immigration and Appeals Court (Siac), which late last year confirmed the detentions to be appropriate. These statements link each of the men to terrorist organisations and fraudulent activities claimed to be financing a terrorist agenda. For example, one case summarises that the man in question \"took an important role in support activities for the GSPC [the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, an Algerian extremist group] within the UK and, more widely, for the objectives of Bin Laden and al-Qaida\". But such claims are not backed by surveillance evidence. In all, says Peirce, the open evidence amounts to this: \"You are someone who is associated with other people who are believed to have links with an organisation which is believed to have links in some unspecified way with al-Qaida.\" Any evidence confirming such statements appeared in a closed court, to which the detainees and their lawyers were not invited. </p> <p>The Home Office claims that its \"suspected terrorist\" decisions were based on \"detailed and compelling evidence\" - although evidently not compelling enough to warrant a prosecution - and argues that, although the detentions are an undesirable outcome, there is no alternative. \"What else are you going to do?\" says a spokesman. \"If you are the government of the day, you have an obligation to the public to protect them against a suspected threat.\" </p> <p>But lawyers and campaigners are horrified at the quality of information presented in the open sessions. \"I have been shocked,\" says Natalia Garcia of Tyndallwoods solicitors, who represents two of the detainees. \"I thought the secret services were much more efficient and up to speed.\" Garcia reports that an intelligence service witness at Siac, supposedly a specialist in Islamic extreme groups, had never heard of leading experts in the field and used inaccurate translations in court. According to both Garcia and Peirce, the information given by anonymous MI5 witnesses mentioned organisations nobody else had heard of. The security services relied heavily on press cuttings, even though, as the Observer's home affairs editor, Martin Bright, pointed out in his evidence to Siac, the information in them often came from intelligence sources in the first place. Meanwhile, Sir Peter Heap, a former British ambassador, has written about the unreliability of the intelligence agency MI6: \"A substantial amount of intelligence information is bought,\" he says. \"The sources of a lot of it are quite dubious, and those who are best able to assess the value of that evidence are not allowed to know what the sources are.\" </p> <p>One source, it is feared, may be the defendants' home governments. Men who have fled persecution and been granted asylum here on that basis are perhaps now being detained on the strength of information provided by the persecuting regimes. And it gets worse. Evidence may have been obtained under torture from detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and Bagram military airbase, Afghanistan. Such evidence would be unwelcome in any ordinary British court; indeed, torture or no, any information extracted from inmates at Guant\u00e1namo would probably be regarded as unsafe. \"These are people who have been held for well over two years in a legal limbo,\" says a spokesman for Amnesty. \"I would say anything to get out of there, anything - even if it incriminated someone else.\" </p> <p>However, this is not ordinary British judicial procedure. In August, appeal court judges decreed that evidence extracted under torture was admissible in British courts, as long as British agents were not the ones doing the torturing. This followed an appeal by the detainees, involving a byzantine discussion of what could or could not be admissible evidence: if the torture was carried out by British officials, the evidence definitely could not be accepted by a British court, but what if they were simply present at the time of the torture, or knew it was going to happen? \"For the victim of torture,\" the Amnesty spokesman responds, \"who cares if it was a British official or not?\" A further appeal is scheduled to be heard at the House of Lords on October 4 to 7. </p> <p>None of the detainees can understand why he has not at any point been questioned. This is in stark contrast to the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, who are so regularly questioned that fresh interrogators are flown in to operate on three-month shifts. Louise Christian, who represents some of the British detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, says: \"The US openly avow they are holding people at Guant\u00e1namo for intelligence purposes and are actively pursuing that, but the British authorities have decided that their detainees are a threat to national security, and are not holding them for intelligence purposes.\" If the British security services genuinely believe the Belmarsh detainees are terrorists, it is odd that they do not see the need to try to glean information from them about other associates or planned campaigns. Peirce says she has seen a five-year-old MI6 report on one of the detainees describing him as \"a charismatic figure of influence . . . exerting a restraining influence on potential younger hotheads\". </p> <p> </p> <p> O ne of the first to be detained was Mahmoud Abu Rideh, a Palestinian refugee in his early 30s, whose name was released before the court order barring such disclosures came into effect. He is, it is claimed, \"closely involved with senior extremists and associates of Osama bin Laden, both in the UK and overseas\". He counters that his charitable work in Afghanistan, where he set up a school for the children of \"Britain's most wanted\", did indeed put him in contact with affiliates of al-Qaida - but was he aiding the cause of terror by helping the children of extremists? \"Maybe your father was not a judge; maybe your children won't be either,\" he told Siac. A father of five, Abu Rideh is diagnosed as suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, having been tortured in Israel, and his imprisonment at Belmarsh has triggered flashbacks. He was transferred to Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, but experts who have examined him believe he should be placed near his family, at a hospital with less oppressive security measures. Doctors at Broadmoor have accused the Home Office of \"unprecedented political interference\", since it has ignored their advice. </p> <p>\"Mr M\", a 38-year-old Libyan, was released in March after a Siac appeal found that his 15-month detention under the ATCSA was based on evidence that was \"wholly unreliable and should not have been used\". Now, he says, he can think of nothing but the men he has left behind in Belmarsh. In April, he told the Guardian: \"I knew some of them outside of the prison. Their behaviour and how they were when I saw them inside was completely different. They had lost weight and three or four of them had gone crazy.\" Lawyers confirm that they are seeing these men collapse. \"We are more than worried,\" says Peirce. \"We now regard this as an emergency.\" A Home Office spokesman says that detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons have ready access to routine and emergency medical care. </p> <p>Last December, the home secretary, David Blunkett, said of the detentions: \"These were not powers I assumed lightly. I have never pretended that they are ideal, but I firmly believe that they are currently the best and most workable way to address the particular problems we face.\" This has echoes of Tony Blair's justification of his stance on Iraq as a difficult but necessary decision. In any case, the Home Office is confident that the act is checked in several ways, the obvious one being Siac, since its purpose is to review the government's certification. But Siac uses the standard of proof set by the ATCSA itself - a \"reasonable belief\". \"If you and I had a car accident, we would have to prove our facts to a higher degree,\" says the Amnesty spokesman. The ATCSA has to be renewed by parliament every five years, and the clause relating to detention reviewed every 15 months. But the internment laws in Northern Ireland during the 1970s carried similar renewal provisions and lasted over 20 years. </p> <p>The purpose of the reviews is not to question the antiterrorism law which allows for detention, but rather to establish that the new law is not being misused.\"If the law in itself is flawed, then the checks on it just become a bit of PR,\" says Tony Bunyon at Statewatch, an information group that monitors the state and civil liberties in the EU. </p> <p>Because they are nameless, faceless, hidden, it is as though the detainees are not connected to families and communities. In fact, most of the men, who are all in their 20s and 30s, have wives and children; two became fathers while in prison. Now some of the detainees' wives have begun to speak of their experiences, after meeting one another for the first time in July. \"We were shocked at the horrendous experiences of racism and harassment,\" says Niki Adams at Legal Action for Women, which hosted the meeting at the Crossroads Women's Centre in London. Where the police raids had been visible, the wives left behind were often bullied by neighbours. One of the wives says of another: \"She was left with her children with a broken door for several days, and was terrified that people would break in and attack her. She was terrorised by her racist neighbour, who set his dog on her and threw cleaning water on her on the stairs of her estate.\" </p> <p>The women complain that they were treated like criminals when their husbands were arrested - even when they had children or elderly relatives with them. \"Both the prison officers and the police mocked us and our religion,\" says one of the wives. \"They behaved like they knew our husbands were guilty and we were stupid because we didn't know what our husbands were doing. They tried to make me suspicious of my husband . . . It really got to me.\" The women, says Adams, are now \"hanging on by their fingertips\" as they try to support both their husbands and their children. \"Their kids just couldn't understand it -there was nothing the mothers could say to explain why their fathers had been taken away from them, with no end in sight.\" She adds: \"All the women, unprompted, described their husbands as very sociable people, generous and relied on by lots of people in the community. Their houses were meeting places where newcomers would be welcomed.\" </p> <p>Those homes must seem empty now. \"I didn't go to anyone outside my family for help, because I knew that if I got in contact with someone, they would be under suspicion,\" says one woman. \"Many of my friends disappeared because of this.\" The apparent lack of evidence on the detainees was enough to make others wonder: if they can pick him up like that, then why not me? </p> <p>That message is being heard loud and clear by Britain's Muslim population. The detentions \"strike almost all Muslims as deeply unjust\", says Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). Because this detention law does not apply to British citizens, it effectively creates a different set of rules for foreigners. Indeed, that is being said about Britain's terrorism laws with regard to Muslims. When in July the Home Office released figures showing a 300% increase in police use of stop-and-search powers against British Asians, it came as no surprise to members of that community. \"We were hearing of far, far greater increases in the number of people being stopped and searched, but even so, these figures are stark,\" says Bunglawala. Since 2001, the number of white people stopped and searched under antiterrorism laws has doubled. </p> <p>The ATCSA was introduced hurriedly in 2001 in response to the fear, frequently reiterated since, that Britain is likely to be the target of an attack. Security experts warn that the threat comes from within, from al-Qaida sympathisers living in the UK, and that the terror is getting closer: after 9/11, it was Bali, then Kenya; after that, British targets in Turkey and, nearer still, the devastating train bombs in Madrid. Coupled with the Terrorism Act of 2000, the act gives the state extra powers of search, arrest, questioning, surveillance and detention. Lawyers, human rights groups and campaigners have for some time been warning of the effects of Britain's counterterrorism measures: of a widespread misuse of police stop-and-search powers; erroneous arrests in high-profile raids; indefinite detentions without trial. Long-established civil liberties - freedoms of speech, movement and association; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair trial - are in jeopardy. Yet there is little public outcry, even at the clearly discriminatory incarceration in Belmarsh. These freedoms are mainly being denied to minority groups. Unless you are a Muslim, a migrant or a vocal dissident, you may not feel their effect. </p> <p>The consensus appears to be that if this is what it takes to keep the rest of us safe, so be it: the authorities know what they are doing. Well, do they? </p> <p> S ince September 11 2001, there have been 622 terrorism arrests; of these, 69 led to charges and there have been 15 convictions, although several cases are pending. Many of the arrests were made in high-profile raids that allegedly thwarted devastating bomb plots, vindicating the government's continued warnings about terror threats and the need for harsh laws to counter them. Rarely have we heard what happened to the hundreds of people who were arrested and then released without charge. </p> <p>Shadman Sofi, 26, and Rebaz Ali, 23, sit in a flat above a kebab shop in Manchester, the one that was splashed all over our TV screens when police raided it in the early hours of April 19. \"They came to my flat, attacked me, pushed me to the floor and claimed I was a terrorist,\" says Sofi, who insists that \"acts of terror are against my ideology\". This was part of a huge antiterrorist operation which, we were told, foiled a plot to blow up Old Trafford football ground. Nine men and one woman were arrested by police. The next day, the Sun newspaper carried the following headline: \"Bomb gang had tickets all around the ground; Man Utd suicide blasts foiled.\" The Daily Mail took a similar line: \"Al-Qaida terror strike at Man Utd match is foiled.\" Eight days later, all 10 individuals were released. No charges were made against them. </p> <p>In Sofi's flat, there are posters of Old Trafford and Britney Spears on the walls. Sofi and Ali are big fans of Manchester United. \"All my life, I supported Manchester United. I love them,\" says Ali, who was a professional footballer in his home of Halabja in northern Iraq. They would have loved to attend the Liverpool v Manchester United game at which they were supposed to blow up Old Trafford, but neither could afford the tickets. In fact, the only football ticket found in Sofi's flat was two years old, kept as a souvenir. Sofi's CD collection includes Kurdish singers and top 40 pop groups. Before the raid, the two say, they would \"work all week, then go out and enjoy ourselves, drinking and clubbing at the weekend\". They are, in short, young men who spend their time doing young men things. Or, at least, they used to. </p> <p>\"Our reputation is in ruins,\" says Sofi, like Ali an Iraqi Kurd. \"We have lost our jobs, our girlfriends, we lost our friends. Nobody believes that we are not terrorists.\" The men, both atheists who say they have never set foot inside a mosque, want to change their names and move towns, because otherwise \"people will always remember us as the people who tried to bomb Manchester football ground\". They have received no apologies and do not know why they were arrested. Greater Manchester police say of all 10 arrests: \"The decision to run the operation was taken because of credible intelligence. It was 100% justified and there was no alternative for us.\" </p> <p> I rreversibly stigmatised, Sofi and Ali are also in a legal limbo, unable to work or receive benefits. Their asylum applications have been rejected, but they cannot be sent back to Iraq because it is not safe for them - and they have no passports or ID papers, so they can't go to any other country, either. Before their arrests, they both worked illegally in a packing factory - but now, says Sofi, they \"can't even get jobs on the black market\". They are surviving solely on the charity of their friends. Ali, whose mother, father, two brothers and two sisters were killed in Saddam's gas attacks on Halabja in 1988, says: \"Sometimes I wish I had been killed like them and not come to this country and been treated like this.\" </p> <p>Muddassar Arani, of solicitors Arani &amp; Co, represents many such cases. \"I wish people could see the human side: the wives being thrown out of their homes, one woman miscarrying from the shock of her husband's arrest, the effect it has on the children.\" </p> <p>Some of those arrested are more vocal than others. Babar Ahmad, a 30-year-old from Tooting, south London, was one of 14 people picked up in early morning raids across the country by antiterrorist branch police officers in early December last year. It made all the papers. Ahmad was, he says, assaulted by police in his home: \"Before I knew it, six or seven police officers are beating the daylights out of me. I'm lying on the floor with arms restrained behind my back and four people punching me on my face, my head, my ears, my back and my legs.\" He says that police officers also forced him to strip and assume the prayer position, asking, \"Where is your God now?\" and that he was further assaulted in the police van on the way to the station. </p> <p>Three days later, a doctor found that Ahmad had injuries all over his body, and tests found blood in his urine. He was held and questioned for seven days. \"It's not like you participated in a crime, or there is a particular crime that they want to ask you about,\" he said in July. \"They asked about my family, my political opinions, what mosque I go to . . . they try to incriminate you with anything. So if you have a bank receipt that says you spent \u00a365 in a Birmingham hotel, it's, 'OK, why did you go to Birmingham? Oh, maybe you went to scout the airport?' \" </p> <p>He was released without charge, but in early August he was picked up again, this time as a terror suspect on an extradition request from the US. Calling it an \"al-Qaida raid\", the Evening Standard reported that Ahmad was accused in court of being in possession of battle plans to attack the US navy. \"Are we to believe that the police massively cocked up in December and released al-Qaida's naval operations commander on to the streets of Tooting?\" asks Adnan Siddiqui of the campaign group Stop Police Terror. </p> <p>At the time of going to press, Ahmad was awaiting a second bail application. His first was refused: the prosecution lawyer pointed to Ahmad's house sale as evidence that he was cutting ties to this country. (Ahmad had earlier told me that he and his wife were selling their home because of its traumatic associations with the first arrest.) Meanwhile, the US government has until 65 days from the time of his arrest on August 5 to provide documents supporting the extradition request. Now at Woodhill prison, Ahmad is also awaiting the outcome of an investigation into his claims of police abuse by the Independent Police Complaints Commission -the IPCC findings were lodged on August 5 with the Crown Prosecution Service, which has yet to decide on what action, if any, should be taken. </p> <p>Over the past two years, there have been several other headline-grabbing, counterterrorism raids, notably the ricin swoops in January last year which, we were told, were part of a \"massive and complex\" investigation of a plot to use this lethal poison in a terror attack. After the initial panic died down, we heard that ricin was more commonly used to forge passports, although some of the ricin cases have yet to appear in court. </p> <p>Then came the raids in March this year, involving five police forces and 700 officers, when eight people were arrested under suspicion of involvement with terrorist activity. This time, half a tonne of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, of the type used as explosive in the Bali and Istanbul bombings, was found in a London self-storage unit. Court cases are expected some time next year. </p> <p>Last month, 13 people were arrested in counter-terrorism raids across the country. After being held by police for two weeks, the maximum time allowed, eight men were charged with terrorist offences. \"Were they plotting another 9/11?\" asked the Daily Express, naming the eight. The charges are both severe and oblique: conspiring to murder and commit public nuisance; plotting to use \"radioactive materials, toxic gases, chemicals and explosives\"; having \"reconnaissance plans\" for finance buildings in New York and, in one case, possessing a \"terrorist's handbook\". The men were due to appear in court again on September 3. </p> <p>That the focus of counterterrorism should be on Muslims is inevitable, given the degree to which Islam has been associated with violent extremism. \"There is nothing Islamic about what al-Qaida are doing. They are completely using it to further their own agenda,\" says Samar Mashadi at the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism (Fair). But much of the media doesn't want to know. \"It is always the 'mad mullahs' that are trotted out in the media,\" says Liz Fekete at the Institute of Race Relations. \"So that becomes the voice of the Muslim community as far as the general public is concerned. You have that stigma always attached to the Muslim community - that they are potential terrorists.\" </p> <p>If the police and security services seem focused on Muslims and asylum seekers, it legitimises racism on the streets. A Fair log of racist incidents in Britain is a catalogue of verbal and physical abuse, anthrax hoaxes in mosques and incidents of pork-hurling at Muslims on the streets. Massoud Shadjareh at the Islamic Human Rights Commission, meanwhile, says he has heard of \"around 700 attacks on Muslims in the year after September 11\". Small wonder, then, that Muslims are now considering whether it is time to leave Britain. \"People who were born here are now talking openly about whether there is room for them in this society,\" says Shadjareh. \"It is so sad, because we used to say to Europe that Britain was a good example of Muslim integration.\" </p> <p>And it's counterproductive. \"People accept that it is the police and secret services' responsibility to establish law and order,\" says Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain. \"But when they go and knock on somebody's door, they don't have to treat people, the whole family, as if they are all terrorists, all criminals. Because of this, our young people have lost trust in the system, which will take a long time to recover.\" After the Madrid bombings, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) sent letters to all UK mosques and Islamic centres, urging that anyone with information about potential acts of terror should tell the police. \"That call went right around the community,\" says Bunglawala of the MCB. \"But incidents like stop-and-searches for no identifiable reason only undermine the trust of the Muslim community and their willingness to help.\" </p> <p> A nd all the while more counterterror laws are being passed. In February, the ATCSA was changed so that police can now detain terror suspects without charge for 14 days instead of seven. In March, without consulting parliament, the government agreed that US extradition requests need not carry any prima facie evidence. When Lofti Raissi was detained in Belmarsh for five months after being accused by American authorities of training the pilots in the September 11 attacks, a judge finally decided there was not enough evidence on which Raissi could be extradited. That wouldn't happen now. It does not bode well for Babar Ahmad, who is in Woodhill awaiting evidence from the US to support its extradition request. Richard Egan, the solicitor who represented Raissi, says that supporting evidence now just means confirmation of the name and that the crime is indeed extraditable. \"The fact that the US can just say, 'We want X or Y, and we don't need to tell you why or to put it to the test' is extremely worrying.\" </p> <p>Tony Bunyon of Statewatch, an information group that monitors civil liberties in the EU, believes that, as a consequence of legislating to fight the so-called war on terror, \"we will end up defending a democracy which is not a democracy\". We are moving down that road now, he adds. We have already arrived, say the detainees at Belmarsh and the asylum seekers interviewed here, all of whom came to Britain precisely because they thought it honoured human rights and the rule of law</p>",
  "<p>Brian Delaney never does lunch. Typically, his breakfast is a bowl of yogurt (fat-free) sprinkled with cereal (sugar-free), berries and some (fat-free) soya milk. Although sometimes he skips that meal, too. For dinner he chooses something more substantial - a piece of steamed fish, maybe, and a large green salad (no croutons, dressing or mayonnaise). Occasionally, for instance, every six months and only if he feels he has deserved it by working out extra hard at the gym, he allows himself a couple of M&amp;Ms or a glass of red wine. </p> <p> Mostly, Delaney's calorie intake barely nudges 1,800 a day, half the amount consumed by the average western male. At 5ft 11in and weighing less than 10 stone, he is thin and usually hungry. It is 10 years since he first put himself on a brutally restrictive diet (initially he ate even less), yet he still experiences the cavernous \"pit in the stomach\" every mid-afternoon, an energy trough familiar to all dieters. His approach goes way beyond cutting down on food to look good or feel healthier. To the casual observer, it looks like anorexia. But Delaney firmly believes that extreme deprivation enhances his wellbeing. </p> <p>Drastic calorie restriction, or CR, has been shown to increase the lifespan of laboratory animals. Delaney would like to live for ever, but will settle for making it to 122. And if the ageing process in mice and guppies is slowed when their food consumption is halved, why shouldn't it work for him? It is in the name of superlongevity that, as president of the CR Society, a growing but controversial movement, Delaney advocates cutting back on food to the point of bare subsistence. There are 1,000-plus members worldwide of the California-based CR Society, all of whom adhere to the principle that a degree of self-starvation can trigger physiological and biochemical changes in the body that will enable them to have the last laugh on cynics. If all goes to plan, that will be some time next century. </p> <p>On a continuum of diet behaviour, CR appears to sit somewhere between fads (Atkins, Zone, South Beach) that claim to streamline the podgy, and completely disordered eating. If society's obsession with dieting has taught us anything, it is that self-denial - whether of carbohydrates, protein, fat or calories - is the key to success. CR takes abstinence to a new level. At its most draconian, CR's ultra-lean followers consume only 1,200 calories a day, an amount the British Nutrition Foundation considers unhealthily low even for women, who usually need to eat less than men to survive. All members exist on at least 1,000 calories below the optimum level recommended in the government's healthy eating guidelines (around 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men - more if you are particularly tall or active). </p> <p>Where CR departs most radically from dieting is in its underlying philosophy. By definition all CR adherents are skinny, but that is not their goal. Their mission is to postpone the onset of killer ailments such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, and to stretch out their golden years long enough to see their grandchildren's children grow up. It is a Methuselahn ideal, questionable in terms of both ethics and rationale. Why anyone would want to outlive their family, friends and peers is unfathomable to many. </p> <p>Michael Rae, a spokesman for the CR Society, is 6ft tall and weighs 8st 2lb. He reflects the views of many in declaring that \"ageing is a horror that has got to stop now\" and that \"at this moment CR is the only tool we have to stay younger longer\". He argues, plausibly, that \"people are popping antioxidants, getting facelifts and injecting Botox, but none of that's working\"; however, his suggested solution - self-starvation - is bewildering. Rae, a vitamin researcher from Calgary, has a high-powered career. He and Delaney and other society members - scientists, businessmen - are the last people you would expect to be swept up by a dietary fad. In stark contrast to the majority of those targeted by the diet industry, the CR Society's membership is predominantly male. </p> <p>Dave Fisher from Ascot, Berkshire, is currently one of only two signed-up CR members in the UK. He was attracted not by the promise of shedding pounds (in fact, he had little to lose), but by the scientific theories on which CR is based. \"In 1981 I read a short article in New Scientist about experiments on rodents that lived longer when they were fed less,\" he says. \"I thought, 'Isn't that really important? If it works for other warm-blooded mammals, it should work for us.'\" Fisher began trawling libraries and journals for more evidence, and initially eliminated junk food from his diet. \"Sweets were out, fruit was in. Then I read that hydrogenated vegetable oil was two-thirds toxins, so avoided anything containing that. Wheat gave me migraines, so that was out.\" Within months, he had reduced his daily intake by 2,000 calories a day. </p> <p>Fisher saw his weight plummet to less than 9st 7lb, which, on any height and weight chart, would be considered too low for his 5ft 10in frame. His weight has since increased to what he considers \"a healthier\" 10st 7lb, after he adopted a regime of no breakfast, a 500-calorie lunch (\"150g blueberries, 150g raspberries, a handful of almonds\") and a 1,000-calorie evening meal of vegetables and a chicken breast. He likes tuna, but tries to avoid it - \"It's loaded with mercury\" - and occasionally succumbs to a protein bar with a meal: \"I love them, but they contain 240 calories, which is bad\". He accounts for every single calorie he consumes: \"Is that obsessive? I'm not sure. Some CR-onies have software that analyses every nutrient in every food. That is verging on the obsessive.\" </p> <p>What does he miss? \"Oh, there are loads of things: bread, especially ciabatta and granary, custard slices, bacon, doughnuts, cheese, sausages, chocolate . . .\" If he smells them, he is tempted. But he has never once strayed from his path. \"At the start, you con yourself into eating things,\" he says. \"I mean, for instance, I hated vegetables as a child, but when I started CR I made myself like them by pretending I liked the taste. Now I think they are fine.\" Taste preferences, he says, are developed, not innate. \"You can make yourself like anything. No child likes beer, but we make ourselves like it as adults. With CR, we apply that theory in reverse.\" </p> <p>Yes, of course he missed alcohol at first. He weaned himself off it gently, switching first to low-alcohol beer. Now he says he never fancies an ice-cold beer, not even on a hot summer's day. As for hunger, he insists he rarely feels it, as long as he feeds himself his allotted number of daily calories. \"I look at it this way: if I was destined to live to 90, I can extrapolate from studies that I might live another 40 years on this diet. And if you can live even an extra 10 years, then life-extending discoveries might have been made which give you another 20 years of life.\" </p> <p>Bob Simpson, 52, from Essex (5ft 9in, 8st 7lb), who has been on the full CR diet for eight years, is similarly convinced. \"In the past 10 years, so much science has been done on this,\" he says. But has there? Researchers first laid the groundwork for calorie restriction in the 1930s. Professor Clive McCay, a nutritionist at Cornell University, discovered by chance that underfed rats not only maintained a more youthful appearance than those on a regular diet, but lived up to one-third longer. Similar results have been obtained with monkeys, dogs and any number of species. Except humans. Experts point out that evidence of CR helping people to live longer remains speculative. \"Trials would be too lengthy and difficult,\" says Dr Toni Steer, a nutritionist at the Medical Research Council's centre in Cambridge. \"Animals have a relatively short lifespan, but humans increasingly live into their 70s and 80s, which makes it harder to study the effects of such a diet.\" </p> <p>Even so, few doctors oppose the principles of calorie reduction per se, especially since CR members ensure \"optimal nutrition\", including essential vitamins and minerals, from what little food they do eat. Crucially, this is what sets CR apart from eating disorders such as anorexia, which restrict all food, and therefore all essential nutrients, to a point where the body is unable to function in a normal way. There is some historical evidence to support CR. After the second world war, for instance, when food rationing was enforced, there was a drop in mortality from heart disease and diabetes. Dr Anne Nugent, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, says this stems from the reality that \"most people eat too much anyway, and if you replace calorie-dense, fatty foods with more fruit and vegetables, then that is a good move\". However a scepticism about prolonged and extreme CR remains. </p> <p>Delaney is pleased with his progress so far. Twice a year in Stockholm, where he lives, he has a blood test and medical. To date, \"the results indicate a physically active, very healthy 25-year-old\". Not bad for a man of 40. He concedes that sticking to the diet can be trying at times, but is considering cutting back a bit more. \"Maybe eating just a little less would give me a little more energy, make me more clear-headed. It does appear that this is really, really good for you. The evidence is just pouring in every day.\" </p> <p>Fisher, too, says that, at 47, he has been told he has the health status of someone 20 years his junior. \"I was a subject in an American trial on calorie restriction last year. The researchers found my aerobic capacity to be better than 90% of the population. I am fit and healthy and I feel good.\" </p> <p>The pursuit of an ageless body is becoming the research topic of the moment. One theory is that calorie restriction works because it slows down metabolism, or the burning of calories as fuel, in an instinctive reaction to conserve energy; ordinary dieters suffer the same effect, which is why they reach a plateau of weight loss and struggle to shift more fat. While metabolism is essential to life, it can have a destructive effect. \"A fast metabolism can lead to a greater production of free radicals, the damaging substances produced by oxidation that are involved in many chronic diseases,\" explains Steer. \"What [CR] advocates are proposing is that by eating less they are directly reducing the production of dangerous compounds. It is plausible that, up to a point, fewer calories will lower the risk of some diseases. But it has never been categorically proven to prolong life.\" </p> <p>Dr Mark Mattson and his colleagues at America's National Institute of Ageing, in Baltimore, have already discovered that mice fed every other day appeared to live longer than those allowed to eat at will. At the end of Mattson's experiment, all the mice were injected with a toxin that damages cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain where cell damage causes Alzheimer's disease. The semi-starved mice were shown to be more resistant to the toxins, as well as less prone to markers for diabetes. </p> <p>For humans, there is an obsessiveness inherent in CR. Preparing meals, even stocking your fridge, is a complex business. It will also burn a hole in your pocket. A diet based primarily on fresh foods, with ingredients such as brewer's yeast, flaxseed, bean-sprouts and nuts featuring in most recipes, is not cheap. The scores of recipes posted on the society's website includes a \"better chocolate pudding\" made with, among other things, 13 squirts of sucralose concentrate, guar gum and micronised cellulose. </p> <p>It took Michael Sherman just over a year to engineer the precise formula for his Megamuffins, which contain 27 ingredients - including psyllium husk, raw wheatgerm and flaxseed. His recipe, posted on the society's website, has become a favourite with followers. It is, claims the 46-year-old company director from Silicon Valley, the fact that the muffins \"supply 20% of the recommended daily amount of the usual nutrients, plus omega-3 fats, low glycaemic index, high protein and fibre and a zone-like macronutrient profile\" that makes them so popular. More crucially, one suspects, they provide just 150 calories each, compared with the 400-plus in the average blueberry muffin from Starbucks. </p> <p>Calorie restrictors claim to be sacrificing food for others - they want to be around for their grandchildren - but their lifestyle can alienate them from friends and family. Sherman's wife, Kathy, remains unconvinced by her husband's drive to live for ever. She and their children have steadfastly stuck with such all-American staples as Krispy Kreme doughnuts and pizza. Never, she says, has she been tempted to refuse her favourite foods by the promise it would add hours to her life. \"Are you kidding?\" she says. A couple of years ago, the stress of Michael's CR habit became so great that Kathy seriously contemplated divorce. If anything, she thinks her husband's six-year anti-ageing mission has left him more worn out than men of the same age. His initial weight loss - at 5ft 5in tall, he now weighs 10st - was so drastic that close friends and family became concerned for his health. \"Here was this one-time powerlifter who looked to me like a concentration camp refugee,\" says Kathy. </p> <p>Michael was irritable and his sex drive was stuck in neutral. A compromise was eventually reached - Michael had counselling and, on the advice of his therapist, took a prescription drug to boost his libido. He also hired a daily help to mix his fresh Megamuffins, giving him more time to spend with the kids. He refuses to change his goals, but has agreed to be more accommodating to family life. He now uses a separate fridge to store his soy protein and guar gum staples, stacking them neatly in rows of plastic containers. A huge stride forward came when he recently agreed to buy his children doughnuts on a Sunday, even though he still refuses to take even one bite himself. Meanwhile, Kathy has tried to be more accepting of his quirky diet, although she remains convinced it is draining Michael of vitality. </p> <p>CR proponents usually sacrifice any notion of getting a gym-honed physique. However, when you eat too little for too long, your body goes into shut-down mode, says Anne Nugent, from the British Nutrition Foundation. \"You get muscle wastage, lose strength and generally feel tired all the time. Your body is using all its energy supplies just to sustain vital functions.\" </p> <p>Simon, a 45-year-old IT consultant from Hertfordshire, seems to exemplify this. He was once a county-level swimmer but has been unable to manage more than a couple of lengths a week since he switched to CR seven years ago. He is not a member of the society, but embraces its philosophy to the full. For his height (6ft 1in), he is a painfully scrawny 8st 5lb. Lack of energy is one of the downsides in his case, he concedes. \"But it's worth sacrificing if you feel as good about life as I do.\" </p> <p>There is also concern that CR will attract those predisposed to eating disorders. Delaney is undeterred, saying only children should be banned from trying it. \"If I were going to advocate something publicly, it would be this - if you are not at risk from eating disorders, if you've spoken with your doctor, if you are concerned about your health, then I'd suggest trying calorie restriction.\" Suggestions that CR is in any way unhealthy for normal adults were also dismissed by Roy Walford, former professor of pathology at UCLA, who realised the benefits of eating less after spending two years of a research programme living in a self-contained ecosystem in the Arizona desert. As food supplies dwindled, Walford and his colleagues were forced to practise CR involuntarily, and found that their blood sugar, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and, of course, weight dropped precipitously. </p> <p>If there is a Dr Atkins of the CR community, it's Walford. His books, including The Anti-Ageing Plan, have become bibles of calorie restrictors worldwide. In a cruel twist, the professor suffered from the nerve disorder Lou Gehrig's disease, and was confined to a wheelchair for the last few years of his life (there is no suggestion the disease is linked to diet). Until his death, he remained a staunch calorie restrictor, and was adamant that an anti-ageing cure lies ahead. Last year, researchers at Harvard Medical School discovered a chemical, resveratrol, in grape skins (and therefore in red wine) that increased life span in yeast and fruit flies by 60%. They were optimistic that it might have the same effect at cellular level in humans. </p> <p>In January, Mattson, of the US National Institute of Ageing, began the first major study of the long-term effects of meal-skipping on humans. He is screening men and women between 40 and 50 to see how blood pressure, immune function and other markers respond to one daily meal versus three. \"We think what happens is that going without food imposes a mild stress on cells and those cells respond by increasing their ability to cope with more severe stress,\" says Mattson, who admits to skipping breakfast himself for the past 20 years and who, at 5ft 9in, weighs only 8st 7lb. It remains possible that CR enthusiasts are on to something after all: starve yourself and, rather than crumbling through the self-inflicted torture, your body responds by enhancing its own defences in the face of deprivation. Their mantra, that if you eat a third less, you will live a third longer, could yet be proven to be true. </p> <p>Those who are hooked on deprivation are optimistic they'll be around to witness it becoming a mainstream approach. Delaney is already planning how to fill those extra decades he is storing up. He wants to write books, record some jazz CDs, study Nietzsche and, of course, spread the word about CR.

  "In 1982, I was down at an interfaith centre in the West Country. A friend, an Anglican priest, suggested we went to meet his bishop. Since this particular bishop lived in a proper palace, I was really up for the visit and spent a lot of time gawping at the moat, crenellated walls and power-portraits. <p>The bishop was charming but suggested, en passant, that the massacres at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps did not represent Judaism's finest hour. Being a small but bolshy Jew, I pointed out that the massacres had been perpetrated by Lebanese Christian militia and what did he have to say about that? He looked at me with genuine bemusement and said: \"Obviously they weren't Christians because Christians don't do things like that. So I suppose we say, 'the blighters'.\" </p> <p>I didn't think it was a terribly adequate response but it was only a couple of sentences in a long exchange about the common problems faced by Christianity and Judaism in Britain. </p> <p>Even in the 1980s, Matthew Arnold's 150-year-old Dover Beach poem about the tide of faith receding still deafened us all. We worried about the death of God, being honest to God, and religion evaporating into the secular air. Perhaps that's why it didn't seem to us to play a significant part in most of the troubles of the world - with Belfast and Jerusalem as only partial exceptions. I remember giving sermons about the derivation of the Hebrew word for war - milchamah - which is from the word lechem, bread. The Marxists, I said, had a point when they saw economics as the basis for all struggle. It's poverty, not religion, that is the problem \"out there\". But the real problem, here where it matters, is the receding tide of faith. </p> <p>With hindsight, I can see what a staggeringly insular perspective it was. Because faith is not on the retreat from most of the beaches of the world, only in northern Europe; because religion continues to be a hugely significant factor in global conflict. What is happening today isn't new, it's just that we faith leaders in this country didn't see it, didn't see what was coming and didn't have a clue as to our part in it all. </p> <p>Nineteen years later, Tony Blair consulted 25 faith leaders at Downing Street shortly after September 11, but before we went into Afghanistan. It was a touch harder to be blind to global realities. Indeed, I did wonder out loud why he was wasting his time on religion, which seems to me to have come far too close to discrediting itself for anyone's comfort, let alone God's. </p> <p>We have singularly failed to face up to the inescapable truth that faiths only exist relationally. That is that they simply cannot continue posturing as monopolistic corporations, smugly proclaiming themselves as the finished article, the last word and the ultimate truth. They surely should have discovered by now their own provisionality, fragmentary nature and deep flaws. </p> <p>It is bizarre that we should still affirm a God who would bestow the totality of Her truth on any one group of human beings, and still more bizarre that we should believe in groups of human beings as being capable of grasping the totality of God's truth. Yet when my great friend Rabbi Jonathan Sacks tried to say this in a very, very mild and cautious form the outcry within a section of his own constituency almost overwhelmed him. </p> <p>We have made desperately poor progress on the practical agenda of pooling what is best in our respective traditions for the good of humanity and the globe because we cannot bring ourselves to face up to the theological disclosure implicit in our diversity. </p> <p>In fact, though most religious traditions are big on humility in theory, we do not seem to have a clue what it means. I half-expect to be invited to an international conference on humility and religion in which there are endless papers seeking to demonstrate in which faith the concept of humility originated and who should be awarded the gold medal for being the most humble. </p> <p>But clinging to old imperialistic and triumphal notions in the face of glaring reality is not the only charge against us. We have utterly failed to stand up against the fearful, exploitative and reactionary forces - to be labelled for shorthand and convenience purposes only as \"fundamentalist\" - and allowed them to dominate each of us and the world stage perhaps as never before. I hope it is sufficient to say \"settlers\", \"far-right churches in America\", and \"Islamic extremists\" for us to be clear about whom I am talking. </p> <p>The alibis and excuses - they are not really Christians or Muslims because proper Christians or Muslims do not believe/do those things; you mustn't tar everyone with the same brush, some of them are nice, sincere, peace-loving people; people are entitled to their beliefs, you should listen to them; or, worst of all, \"What can we do?\" - simply underline our moral and spiritual bankruptcy. Wimps, the lot of us. </p> <p>In fact, the situation is getting worse and worse. Except in northern Europe, both Christianity and Islam are growing at a rate so staggering that Matthew Arnold must be spinning. What is emerging is a phenomenon that the Anglican theologian John Bowden has described as \"terrifying\", forms of faith that are \"very hostile to other faiths and driven by a sense of malevolent activity by hostile powers that have to be combated\". Religion which is aggressive, triumphalist and thrives on conflict. </p> <p>Even in Judaism, which is far too small to consider converting Africa or the Far East, it is the \"born again\" proponents of inerrancy who read the texts as divine licence to advance and impose their views by whatever means are necessary. </p> <p>I look at Indonesia, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, the Balkans and Sudan, and each instance of bloody conflict has a strong religious dimension. The people involved are Muslims, Christians and Jews, however much they may be behaving in a way that the best or main thrust of their respective traditions contradicts. </p> <p>Lest you jump to the conclusion that I am a naive pacifist, I am not. My Jewish experience tells me that oppression and subjugation don't go away if you acquiesce. Nor am I a self-hating anti-Zionist. I am a Zionist who believes that unless two, viable states are established in Israel/Palestine, the very future of Judaism is threatened and time is rapidly running out. </p> <p>What I do argue is that all faiths, particularly the embarrassingly dysfunctional Abrahamic family, have to acknowledge that no faith tradition is supreme, that no one has a monopoly on God or truth, and that the reality of pluralism discloses a theological obligation to be humble and self-critical, to pool resources, to work together for the good of humanity and the globe rather than fuel its blight and destruction. </p> <p>If only we were able to assert a shared platform that transcended the platitudinous, to stand up to those who pervert our traditions, and to work together for a justice that involves compromise and humility, we might even end up stemming the decline of faith in northern Europe. By demonstrating that religion still offers meaning, purpose and human values, rather than being at best an irrelevance or at worst a bloody disgrace. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Rabbi Tony Bayfield is the head of the Movement for Reform Judaism </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk\">www.reformjudaism.org.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>When I first landed in Saudi Arabia, it was three in the morning. The hour added to the sense of unreality: the chill of the arrivals halls, the shimmering white marble, made you feel you had walked on to a stage set, hazy with dry ice. In silence my passport was taken, the contents of my case turned over and scrutinised. No one met my eyes. There was an Indian man before me in the queue. Perhaps we would be there till dawn? An unspeaking customs official had emptied the cigarettes from his packet of 20 and was slitting open each one, sifting the tobacco with lifted fingers, and sniffing it from time to time like some 18th-century dandy. I glanced at the Indian in sympathy. His glance jerked away.</p> <p>It was my first contact with the avoidant gaze, the flinch of masculine fear. I was a woman, therefore trouble. When my husband hurried towards me, we were careful not to embrace. Outside, the wet heat enveloped me like a blanket. As we fought through it, my case burst open, strewing its contents among the parked cars. When I arrived \"home\" - the first of my four homes in the kingdom - I found I had lost a single shoe. Who picked it up, in the light of day? I hoped he would not come looking for me. Already my hand was reaching for my notebook. I knew I was ensnared in a story, but it was not Cinderella.</p> <p>I lived in the kingdom for four years. My first published novel was completed in a dark apartment in downtown Jidda. I wrote my second in a small expatriate compound, in an ageing prefabricated house where rats bounced and scurried in the roof. I had met my Muslim neighbours; women in seclusion speak, sometimes, with a freedom their men don't possess. I knew I was privileged. I did not believe anything I read in the papers. I did not believe much I was told, but I wrote it down all the same. Out of my notes I planned to make a novel, Eight Months on Ghazzah Street. But I couldn't begin writing it until I had left the kingdom behind me for good.</p> <p>I wrote the novel in England, in the winter of 1986. It always seemed to be dark, and four in the afternoon, rain streaming down. I relived those hot afternoons of conventual enclosure, of stillness, footsteps overhead, the veiled figures of my neighbours slipping down the stairs and out to their waiting cars, where the driver turned his face away and the woman, stepping into the back seat, was hidden behind tinted windows. Smoked glass was not dark enough; a Saudi \"family car\" came with curtains in the back window, with just enough of a gap to give the driver a view of the road behind him.</p> <p>Since I left Saudi Arabia it has never been out of the news. But journalists, because of their transient status, can never experience the texture of life: that daily blend of flatness and fear, the feeling that, though nothing seems to be happening, events are forming up in the shadows. It is as if the whole world is veiled; when bloody reality erupts, when there is a shootout, an explosion, when body parts have to be picked from the gutter, then rumour is the attending policeman. The haze of disinformation descends like certain days I remember, sandstorm days of blurred light.</p> <p>My last house was outside the city. I felt less scrutinised, more desolate. I remember the hostile sunshine, the barren line of hills, the absence of birdsong and the distant line of the freeway: the tiny, silent cars moving from somewhere to somewhere, leaving me behind with my journal.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hilary Mantel's Eight Months on Ghazzah Street is reissued by Harper Perennial</p>",

  "<p>David Hare's Stuff Happens has already become a chewed-over public event. But, after attending its Olivier press night, it also strikes me as a very good, totally compelling play: one that may not contain a vast amount of new information but that traces the origins of the Iraq war, puts it in perspective and at the same time astutely analyses the American body politic. </p> <p>Political theatre comes in all shapes and sizes: satirical, fictional, documentary and agitational. But Hare claims, with some justice, to be writing a history: one that traces a dramatic sequence of events through characters and issues. We know, on the whole, when characters are speaking verbatim. We also deduce, as in a Bush-Blair encounter on a Texas ranch, when Hare is extrapolating from the known facts. We also can work out when Hare is deploying dramatic licence. </p> <p>This last point is crucial because Hare avoids the trap of agitprop by cannily subverting the play's anti-war bias. You see this most powerfully in a speech, credited to a journalist, that questions our tendency to view Iraq from a local political viewpoint. \"From what height of luxury and excess,\" says the character, \"we look down to condemn the exact style in which even a little was given to those who had nothing.\" </p> <p>Hare, in fact, constantly creates a form of internal dialectic. The play ruthlessly exposes the dubious premises on which the war was fought. At the same time, it questions our complacency by reminding us of the pro-war arguments. A New Labour politician - possibly not a million miles from Ann Clwyd - admits that the supposed weapons turned out not to exist and that a military victory was compromised by sloppy Pentagon planning for peace. \"At the same time,\" she argues, \"a dictator was removed.\" </p> <p>Hare's other key means of creating conflict is to view Colin Powell as a stern realist in a Bush war cabinet made up of deluded fantasists. In a big showdown with Bush, based on documented facts, Powell passionately presses the case for treating war as a last resort after diplomacy has been exhausted. In the play's best line, he points out the hypocrisy of American attitudes. \"People keep asking,\" he says of Saddam, \"how do we know he's got weapons of mass destruction? How do we know? Because we've still got the receipts.\" </p> <p>In Hare's terms, and in Joe Morton's performance, Powell emerges as a tragic figure: the one key player in the administration who sees the folly of invasion but who, in a climactic encounter with Bush, bites the bullet and goes along with the Cheney-Rumsfeld line. Hare never explains what leads to Powell's capitulation, but he leaves you in no doubt that it was a form of self-betrayal. </p> <p>The great surprise of the show, however, is the way performance leads to reassessment of character. Bush, in many British eyes, is seen as some kind of holy fool or worse. But, through Hare's writing and Alex Jennings's performance, he emerges as a wily and skilful manipulator who plays the role of a bumbling pseudo-Texan but constantly achieves his desired ends. </p> <p>Jennings, with his wire-drawn upper lip and tentative gestures, has caught the Bush mannerisms exactly: more significantly, he suggests Bush is the most adroit politician on stage. </p> <p>By contrast, Tony Blair is seen satirically: the hints of a moral crusader are there, but in Nicholas Farrell's performance, he emerges largely as a demented egoist obsessed by his own political standing. There may be some truth in this, but the play would be stronger if Hare admitted that Blair may have been propelled by idealistic motives. </p> <p>However, the pleasure lies in seeing recent history, in which we all have a stake, enacted on Britain's most prominent public stage. Nicholas Hytner's production is also elegant and unfussy, with the cast seated on stage throughout and emerging, as required, to enact their part in the drama. And, in a vast cast, there are standout performances from Desmond Barrit as an ideologically-driven Cheney, Dermot Crowley as an assertive Rumsfeld, and Adjoa Andoh as an ice-cold Condoleezza Rice. </p> <p>No play about Iraq can tell the whole story; and I was surprised by Hare's omission of the crucial role played by the military, especially General Tommy Franks, who gave the war its own unstoppable momentum. But Hare's play offers a probing guide to the Iraq war and shows how the whole mess was based on a disastrous, unproven link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. One comes out enriched and better informed.</p>",
  "<p> Philip Roth has had the grandest prizes available to an American writer, some of them more than once, and he has been to the White House to have the National Medal of Arts pinned on him by former president Bill Clinton. But the honour that seems to have pleased him most is the forthcoming multi-volume edition of his collected works in the Library of America. This officially establishes him as an American classic, with Melville, Hawthorne, James, Fitzgerald and Faulkner, and so far only two other writers - Saul Bellow and Eudora Welty - have been immortalised in this way during their lifetimes. </p> <p>For the last decade, at an age when most writers are beginning to lose interest, Roth has produced a series of books more powerful and accomplished than any he has written before. And he shows no signs of slowing down. </p> <p>\"Even now, he doesn't relent,\" says Aaron Ascher, Roth's old friend and editor. \"This is a 70-something-year-old writer who is still going uphill and keeps getting better. He has back problems which give him great pain, yet he's always working. He never stops, even in his worst periods.\" </p> <p>Roth's face is lined now, his mouth has tightened and his springy hair has turned grey, but he still looks like an athlete - tall and lean, with broad shoulders and a small head. Until recently, when surgery on his back and arthritis in the shoulder laid him low, he worked out and swam regularly, though always, it seemed, for a purpose - not for the animal pleasure of physical exercise, but to stay fit for the long hours he puts in at his writing. He works standing up, paces around while he's thinking and has said he walks half a mile for every page he writes. Even now, when his joints are beginning to creak and fail, energy still comes off him like a heat haze, but it is all driven by the intellect. It comes out as argument, mimicry, wild comic riffs on whatever happens to turn up in the conversation. His concentration is fierce, and the sharp black eyes under their thick brows miss nothing. The pleasure of his company is immense, but you need to be at your best not to disappoint him. </p> <p>He has always believed in the separation of life and art. He keeps his private life strictly to himself and prefers not to work where he lives. In Connecticut, his studio is back in the trees away from the house; 30 years ago, when he was spending half the year in London, he lived in Fulham and worked in a little flat in Kensington; in New York, there were two apartments on the Upper West Side, one for living in and a studio for work; when he moved more or less full-time to Connecticut, he kept the New York studio and that is where we met to talk. </p> <p>It is on the 12th floor, a single large room with a kitchen area, a little bathroom and a glass wall looking south across Manhattan's gothic landscape to the Empire State Building, with a wisp of cloud around its top. </p> <p>The lectern at which Roth works is at right angles to the view, presumably to avoid distraction. Above it is a sketch of an open book, with an indecipherable text that might be in Hebrew, by his friend, the late Philip Guston. There is a bed with a neat white counterpane against the wall, an easy chair in the centre of the room, with a graceful standing lamp beside it, all of it leather and steel and glass, discreetly modern. It is a place strictly for work, spare and chaste, a monk's cell with a great view. </p> <p>This seems to fit Roth very well. I once asked him what he would like to have been if he could have lived his life again. \"A parish priest,\" he said, \"swishing around in a cassock and hearing confessions.\" He may have missed out on the cassock - he dresses soberly, neutrally, as though not to be noticed - and celibacy is not his style, but in other ways his life is as stern, self-sufficient and dedicated as any priest's: he works long hours, eats sparingly, drinks hardly at all and goes to bed early. </p> <p>Roth's monkish routine is at odds with what he once called his \"reputation as a crazed penis\" bestowed on him by Portnoy's Complaint, his great panegyric to the comedy of sex. When Portnoy was published in 1969, it seemed to epitomise the anarchic spirit of the decade. Maybe it did, but the author himself was a product of the 1950s, the last generation of well-behaved, sternly educated children who believed in high culture and high principles and lived in the nuclear shadow of the cold war until their orderly world was blown apart by birth-control pills and psychedelic drugs. Portnoy was considered outrageous when it appeared, but the real outrage was Roth's and he was outraged because he couldn't help being a good boy however much he yearned to be bad. </p> <p>Like most Jewish families, Roth's was close-knit, affectionate and tempestuous. His father, Herman, was a passionate New Dealer, a forceful indignant man, who worked for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and rose to be a district manager - which was as high as a Jew could go before Congress passed the Fair Employment Act after the second world war. He and his wife Bess were children of immigrants from eastern Europe and they lived in the largely Jewish Weequahic section of Newark. In those days Newark was the commercial capital of New Jersey, a prosperous industrial town. \"I was brought up in a Jewish neighbourhood,\" he says, \"and never saw a skullcap, a beard, sidelocks - ever, ever, ever - because the mission was to live here, not there. There was no there. If you asked your grandmother where she came from, she'd say, 'Don't worry about it. I forgot already.' To the Jews, this was Zion.\" The neighbourhood schools were good and Roth was a straight A student. He graduated magna cum laude from Bucknell, an idyllic little college in Lewisberg, Pennsylvania, got his MA from the University of Chicago, did a spell in the army, was invalided out with a spinal injury, returned to Chicago to start a PhD and teach freshman English, then dropped out after one term. Ascher first heard of him when his sister, a student at Chicago, wrote to tell him she had sublet an apartment from \"a guy called Philip Roth. He says he's a writer.\" </p> <p>It was a long time, however, before Roth began to write about the world he was brought up in. Neither of his devoted, sensible parents seems to have had much in common with the comic nightmares that tormented Portnoy and they only began to figure large in their son's work after they died. His new novel, The Plot Against America, is, in a way, his memorial to them. When Roth was working on it he told his friend David Plante, the novelist, that he was \"writing about his parents in their prime, when their life was at its full and they were dealing with it\". Though the book turned out to be about a lot of other things as well, the portrait, according to Ascher, is strong and accurate: \"Herman was fiercely what he was - a marvellous, na\u00efve man who loved his children and was perplexed by them. In this new book, Philip puts him in these terrible situations and he reacts exactly as he would have done in real life.\" </p> <p>The idea for the terrible situation occurred to Roth when he read in Arthur Schlesinger's autobiography that the right wing of the Republican party had thought of nominating Charles Lindbergh, the celebrated aviator, anti-semite and friend of Hitler, to run for the presidency against FDR in 1940: \"I wrote in the margin, 'What if they had?' Then I began thinking about other what-ifs, like what if Hitler hadn't lost? All this was happening when I was a little child - I was born in 1933 - but it is quite vivid to me because the great outside world came into the house through the radio and through my father's reactions to it. So it began to make sense as a novel. One of the reasons I could never write about what our family life was really like was because my parents were good, hard-working, responsible people and that's boring for a novelist. What I discovered inadvertently was that if you put pressure on these decent people, then you've got a story.\" </p> <p>Putting pressure on people and facts and his own experience is one of the many solutions Roth has come up with for the problem to which he has devoted his life: how to transform life into art. \"I have to have something to do that engages me totally,\" he says. \"Without that, life is hell for me. I can't be idle and I don't know what to do other than write. If I were afflicted with some illness that left me otherwise OK but stopped me writing, I'd go out of my mind. I don't really have other interests. My interest is in solving the problems presented by writing a book. That's what stops my brain spinning like a car wheel in the snow, obsessing about nothing. Some people do crossword puzzles to satisfy their need to keep the mind engaged. For me, the absolutely demanding mental test is the desire to get the work right. The crude clich\u00e9 is that the writer is solving the problem of his life in his books. Not at all. What he's doing is taking something that interests him in life and then solving the problem of the book - which is, How do you write about this? The engagement is with the problem that the book raises, not with the problems you borrow from living. Those aren't solved, they are forgotten in the gigantic problem of finding a way of writing about them.\" </p> <p>His solutions to the problem have taken many forms as well as a large cast of narrators. Deception, for instance, is written entirely in dialogue, like a stage play. Operation Shylock is a find-the-Roth shell-game, with a false Philip pretending to be the true one until neither is quite sure who is who. The technical problem of The Plot Against America was less tricky but equally hard to solve: although it is a Roth book, the Roth who narrates it is aged seven: \"Prior to that, I'd had these rich brains telling the story and now I was going to have to look over the shoulder of a child. I never wrote What Maisie Knew and this was What Little Philip Knew. How do I do that without putting on a straitjacket? The answer turned out to be quite simple: if you have one child in the centre of the book, you have a problem, but it goes away when he is a child among children. So once I discovered the other children to act as foils for him I was in the clear. Then I had a child's perspective, but the book is no longer told by a child; it's told by an adult remembering his family when he was a child.\" </p> <p>Roth has never been much interested in aesthetic theories and experiment and when he talks about getting a story right he does so, like any craftsman, with a practical understanding of the materials he uses and the techniques needed to get the job done. In The Ghost Writer, the ageing writer, EI Lonoff, tells 23-year-old Nathan Zuckerman, the most disabused of Roth's stand-ins, that he \"has the most compelling voice I've encountered in years. I don't mean style... I mean voice: something that begins at around the back of the knees and reaches well above the head.\" Voice in this sense is the vehicle by which a writer expresses his aliveness and Roth himself is all voice. Style, in the formal, flowery sense, bores him; he has, he once wrote, \"a resistance to plaintive metaphor and poeticised analogy\". His prose is immaculate yet curiously plain and unostentatious, as natural as breathing. Reading him, it's always the story that's in your face, never the style. </p> <p>His voice sounds so spontaneous that the lazy reader might suppose he is listening to confession rather than reading a work of fiction. And this, to Roth, is an insult to the labour he puts into his craft. It also links him with the cult of celebrity and that is something he has fought against throughout his career. </p> <p>\"One dreams of the goddess Fame,\" wrote Peter de Vries, \"and winds up with the bitch Publicity.\" Roth first tangled with the bitch when Goodbye, Columbus provoked rabbis to denounce him as \"a self-hating Jew\", and he responded by writing Letting Go, the most conventional of his novels, as if to show that he was indeed as serious and worthy as authors were expected to be in the 50s. Being a good boy, however, did not sit easily either with his surreal comic inventiveness or with the troubles he was having in a difficult first marriage to Margaret Williams. When he finally yoked comedy and rage together to produce Portnoy's Complaint, the serious writer again came face-to-face with the bitch Publicity and this time she didn't let him go. </p> <p>\"In 1969, I wrote Portnoy. Not only did I write it - that was easy - I also became the author of Portnoy's Complaint and what I faced publicly was the trivialisation of everything.\" </p> <p>Instead of being read as someone playing brilliant games with reality in the tradition of Kafka and Gogol, Roth got scandal, outrage and best-seller celebrity in its most crummy form. According to Ascher, \"the attacks were horrible and disheartening, especially from the Jews. He had to cope with the nightmare of a smash hit. It made him angry and defensive, so he closed up. But maybe it did him good. The setback of great success changed and improved him as a writer. Without it, he'd have been different.\" </p> <p>Roth's immediate response was to refuse all public appearances and retreat to Yaddo, the writers' colony in upstate New York. Hiding himself away was easy, but disguising that distinctive, compelling voice of his was a trickier problem. His solution was ventriloquism, narrators with everyday lives not unlike his, but who see them differently and transform them into something else: disabused, tough-talking Nathan Zuckerman who sniffs out every weakness and forgives no one; studious David Kepesh, a professor to whom outlandish things happen when he lets himself go, but who loves literature as much as he loves women; a character called Philip Roth whose relationship to the author is a source of mystery for both of them. Roth remarked to me, apropos of President Bush, that born-again Christianity is the ignorant man's version of the intellectual life. Similarly, reading fiction as though it were true confessions is the ignorant man's aesthetics and Roth has made a mockery of it in many ways. The eulogist at Zuckerman's funeral in The Counterlife puts it pompously but well: \"What people envy in the novelist... is the gift for theatrical self-transformation, the way they are able to loosen and make ambiguous their connection to a real life through the imposition of talent. The exhibitionism of the superior artist is connected to his imagination; fiction is for him at once playful hypothesis and serious supposition, an imaginative form of inquiry - everything that exhibitionism is not... Contrary to the general belief, it is the distance between the writer's life and his novel that is the most intriguing aspect of his imagination.\" </p> <p>In life as in art: a snide academic at a New York dinner party once tried to show his disdain for the famous author by pretending to mistake him for Herman Wouk and taking him to task for the structural weakness of Marjorie Morningstar. Roth, of course, was too smart to be indignant; he just played right along with the game and became Wouk for the rest of the evening. </p> <p>His most effective escape from New York celebrity was Czechoslovakia and its writers. He stumbled across them inadvertently, when he was on a holiday tour of Europe and stopped off in Prague to pay homage to Kafka. This was in 1972, three years after both the nightmare success of Portnoy and the far greater nightmare that followed the Prague Spring. Through his Czech translator he met blacklisted writers who cleaned windows and stoked boilers for a living while they wrote books that wouldn't be published at home. Their troubles put his into perspective: \"They made me very conscious of the difference between the private ludicracy of being a writer in America and the harsh ludicrousness of being a writer in eastern Europe. These men and women were drowning in history. They were working under tremendous pressure and the pressure was new to me - and news to me, too. They were suffering for what I did freely and I felt great affection for them, and allegiance; we were all members of the same guild.\" </p> <p>Back in New York, Roth immersed himself in literature from behind the iron curtain. He went every week to a little college on Staten Island to attend Antonin Liehm's classes on Czech culture and edited a series of eastern European fiction for Penguin. </p> <p>\"My life in New York after Portnoy was lived in the Czech exile community - listening, listening, listening. I ate every night in Czech restaurants in Yorkville, talked to whoever wanted to talk to me and left all this Portnoy crap behind. That was idiotic, this was not idiotic. I lived up in Connecticut, where Philip Guston was my friend, and had my east European world in New York, and those were the things that saved me. I think that's why Hemingway lived in Key West; he liked to be in a world that had nothing to do with what he did all day. Fame is a worthless distraction.\" </p> <p>Roth's regular visits to Prague continued until 1977, when he was denied an entry visa, and they seemed to bring about a change in his focus as a writer. By then, he was spending half the year in London, but he left in 1989 to be with his father in his final illness and, following the break-up of his second marriage to the actress Claire Bloom, he never went back. It was, he says, a huge relief to be home: \"I used to walk around New York saying under my breath, 'I'm back! I'm back!' I felt like Rip van Winkle waking up with a long beard and discovering there'd been a revolution and the British were gone! Being home, being free in my personal life brought a great revival of energy. I felt renewed.\" </p> <p>While he was rediscovering America, Roth immersed himself in the modern classics and they reminded him of what American novelists do best: \"The great American writers are regionalists. It's in the American grain. Think of Faulkner in Mississippi or Updike and the town in Pennsylvania he calls Brewer. It's there on the page, brick by brick. What are these places like? Who lives there? What are the forces determining their lives? ... I hadn't yet discovered my own place, that town across the river called Newark, and it didn't have any power for me until it was destroyed in the race riots of 1966. Before, it was too pleasant and my family was too decent to write about. Only when the place had been burned down and the families I knew had been exiled did it become a fit subject for inquiry.\" </p> <p>The energy released by his return to America culminated in his great, subversive outburst of comic outrage and exasperation, Sabbath's Theatre. The book reads like Portnoy's Complaint retold by a 60-year-old man raging not about sex, but against the injustice and ludicrousness of death, and it was a turning point. Having vented his rage at the prospect of death, and while he still had time, he set about writing an extraordinary series of novels about what it was like to live in the United States in the second half of the 20th century. After his experience in eastern Europe, he now saw the place more sharply through the lens of history. </p> <p>In the 50s, when Roth was starting out and literature was considered the noblest of all vocations, the best writers responded in an intensely inward way to whatever was going on in the big outside. All that changed, Roth thinks, when Kennedy was assassinated in 1963: \"It was an event so stunning that our historical receptors were activated. The stuff that's happened in the last 40 years - the Vietnam war, the social revolution of the 60s, the Republican backlash of the 80s and 90s - have been so powerfully determining that men and women of intelligence and literary sensibility feel that the strongest thing in their lives is what has happened to us collectively: the new freedoms, the testing of the old conventions, the prosperity. That's what I was writing about in the trilogy that followed Sabbath - American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and The Human Stain: people prepare for life in a certain way and have certain expectations of the difficulties that come with those lives, then they get blindsided by the present moment; history comes in at them in ways for which there is no preparation. 'History is a very sudden thing,' is how I put it. I'm talking about the historical fire at the centre and how the smoke from that fire reaches into your house.\" </p> <p>Old age and its humiliations, he says, are equally unpredictable. \"I think about Hemingway and Faulkner and how it ended for them - tragically, not peacefully in their sleep. Faulkner drank himself to death; Hemingway's body was banged to bits, the booze had saturated him and he couldn't write; he had nothing to live for, so he shot himself. These are lives of torment... I'm not a romantic about writing, I don't want a tormented life and, by and large, I haven't had one. But these guys... I can't stand to think about how they ended.\" </p> <p>\"Who knew what getting old would be like?\" he says. \"There may be a biological blinder about age that's built in. You are not supposed to understand until you get there. Just as an animal doesn't know about death, the human animal doesn't know about age. When I wrote that book about my father in old age, Patrimony, I thought I knew what I was talking about, but I didn't really. In this new book I've brought both my parents back in their full flower. The flow of energy in our house was extraordinary.\" </p> <p>It was also the atmosphere in which Roth's own special talents began to flourish. When he was a teenager and his older brother Sandy was an art student in Brooklyn, they would meet up with their friends most weekends at the Roth house in Newark: \"My mother loved it. Eight or 10 boys, a very mixed bag, but one thing they had in common was tremendous humour. Some of them I still know and they remember roaring with laughter in our house - laughing and eating and laughing. It was a wonderful period, a great explosion of camaraderie. Our subject was the comedy of being between 15 and 20 - comedy located in sex and frustration - lots of longing, little activity. I think that was the incubator for everything.\" </p> <p>Maybe it still is, in a ghostly way. \"Roth often visits his parents' grave in New Jersey,\" Plante says. \"He stands at their graveside and weeps. Then he begins to talk to them and they answer. Then he starts joking with them, they have these funny, bantering conversations and he goes away feeling better.\" </p> <p><strong> Philip Roth</strong> </p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> March 19 1933, Newark, New Jersey. </p> <p><strong> Educated:</strong> Weequahic High School; Bucknell University; University of Chicago. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1959 Margaret Martinson Williams, '63 div; '90 Claire Bloom, '94 div. </p> <p><strong> Some novels:</strong> 1959 Goodbye, Columbus;'62 Letting Go; '69 Portnoy's Complaint; '74 My Life as a Man; '93 Operation Shylock; '95 Sabbath's Theatre. </p> <p>Roth books: 1990 Deception; '91 Patrimony; '93 Operation Shylock; 2004 The Plot Against America. </p> <p>Zuckerman books: 1979 The Ghost Writer; '85 Zuckerman Bound; '86 The Counterlife; '97 American Pastoral; '98 I Married a Communist; 2000 The Human Stain. </p> <p>Kepesh books: 1972 The Breast; '77 The Professor of Desire; 2001 The Dying Animal. </p> <p><strong> Some awards: </strong> 1960, '95 National Book Award; '93, 2000 PEN/Faulkner Award; '98 National Medal of Arts; 2001 American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal.</p>",

  "It is hard to feel sorry for a drug cheat who sullied the name of British athletics and caused his relay teammates to be stripped of their World Championship medals, but spend a couple of hours at the athletic grounds of Chabot Junior College watching the football team train and the temptation to wrap their No 11 in a sympathetic embrace becomes impossible to resist. <p>No offence to the Gladiators, as they are known, who seem a spirited, good-natured bunch, but this place is not the Coliseum. More to the point, it is not the running track of Zurich, or Paris, or the Olympic stadium in Athens. This is home to a junior college football team, the outer limits of the American sporting solar system. It is the bottom rung - the place where Dwain Chambers has decided to start again. </p> <p>From No 1 in Europe to No 11 at Chabot. From 9.87 seconds for 100m and dreams of gold in Athens to standing on a touchline 6,000 miles from home wearing oversized shoulder pads and watching American kids shove each other around. From European champion to non-playing wide receiver on a team going nowhere. It is a bathetic scene and it raises one immediate question. </p> <p>\"Why?\" Chambers shrugs and smiles. \"American football is a sport I've always wanted to play but didn't know how to. I didn't have the time because I was busy doing track stuff. Now I've got two years to occupy and I'm trying to make the most of it.\" </p> <p><b> Complicated</b><br> </p> <p> The answer is more complicated than that, as Chambers, 26, acknowledges. For one thing there is the prospect of the National Football League (NFL). The word is that at least one team - the San Francisco 49ers - would be interested in signing Chambers if he showed even the slightest aptitude for American football. As Chabot's coach, Danny Calcagno, points out: \"You can teach anyone to play football but you can't teach speed.\" </p> <p>The NFL money would be great, especially now that Chambers' savings are gone, much of it on a costly settlement with his former management company, Linford Christie's Nuff Respect, over a disputed sponsorship deal. Then there is the Balco scandal, or as he describes it, \"the grey cloud\". </p> <p>\"For once in my life I can walk down the street and no one bothers me. When I was at home I got bugged all the time,\" he says, before correcting himself. \"Don't get me wrong, that's a good thing normally. But not now, not while I am under this grey cloud. I don't want to be seen in that light.\" </p> <p>The grey cloud, of course, is the out-of-competition drug test he gave at a training camp in Germany on August 1 last year which proved positive for tetrahydrogestrinone - a previously undetectable steroid allegedly developed at the Balco laboratory near San Francisco. That set off a chain of events which led to Chambers receiving a two-year ban from all athletics, a lifetime ban from the Olympics, the loss of his European and World medals and, most of all, the loss of his reputation as one of the sport's good guys. He claimed he was innocent but then they all do. Twelve months later he is not quite ready to confess, but comes close. \"When it happened I knew that me being who I was, that it wasn't going to look good. I thought, here we go. I had to laugh. What the hell else could I do?\" </p> <p>Admit guilt and accept the punishment? \"I was harshly treated. I wasn't the only one who had gone out and got in trouble for supposedly taking steroids, yet I got banned for life from the Olympics. Everyone else who gets busted then comes back. I got the worst of all of us. Apparently only Britain and one other country kick athletes out of the Olympics. I think that's messed up, considering I had been running up and down for England and putting my arse on the line.\" </p> <p>Chambers arrived in California two months ago. He rented a flat in Millbrae, a town close to San Francisco airport - and a 10-minute drive from the Balco lab. He signed for Chabot because he used to train at the college under his old coach, Remi Korchemny. The whole Balco gang used to train at the college - Alvin Harrison, Calvin Harrison, Regina Jacobs, Kelli White - all elite international runners now banned from athletics. Korchemny, meanwhile, is facing criminal charges in connection with the Balco scandal. </p> <p>\"I still see Remi sometimes, when he comes down to the track,\" Chambers says. \"He talked to the people at the college and helped get me a spot on the team, even though I'd never played the sport before.\" </p> <p>It is not hard to fathom Chabot's motives for accepting Chambers. The team - two wins, eight losses last season - could do with all the help (and publicity) it can get. Sub-10 second sprinters don't come knocking that often. </p> <p>\"He's quick,\" says Gladiator's wide receiver Joe Brown. \"I was the quickest at my high school. But compared to him I'm nothing; he's a very, very fast Ferrari and I'm your standard Oldsmobile.\" </p> <p><b> Marginal</b><br> </p> <p>Unfortunately for Chambers, so far he has been unable to secure his student's visa, which means he has not been able to enrol for classes, hence he can not play in matches. All he has are the team's twice-weekly training sessions and even then - because he is not in the team - he plays a marginal part in proceedings. </p> <p>\"Life ain't as fun as it used to be,\" he confesses. \"I used to have a routine. I'd get up and I'd train - get ready for events, for Athens. Now I don't have a routine any more. It's the land of the unknown.\" </p> <p>Instead, he spends a lot of time in his flat, reading, playing video games, watching television. California has 500 channels but he still could not stop himself tuning in to the Olympics. </p> <p>\"That was tough but I had to face my demons. I had to watch it in order to get over the fact that I wasn't there.\" He forces a grin. \"Certain people didn't win and I was happy about that. Not to mention any names...\" </p> <p>Maurice Greene, his old rival? \"No comment.\" </p> <p>What about those who did win - his old team-mates, Britain's 4x100m relay team? \"I was happy ...\" he says, hesitating. \"I was gutted as well, though. We always worked hard to get gold at the Olympics or World Championships or whatever and never got there. Then the minute I wasn't there, they win. But they deserved it, they worked hard for it. We worked hard for it.\" </p> <p>Had he contacted the squad to offer congratulations? \"Nooo,\" he whistles, mortified at the suggestion. \"I thought the best thing to do was walk away. Everything and everybody I have ever known was connecting to track and field but my life is different now; I'm in a team sport, in a different country. It's hard, but I've committed myself to this and I have to see it through.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Seattle Seahawks to win the Super Bowl at 16-1 with Stanley.</strong> </p> <p> Seattle, who were beaten in overtime by the Green Bay Packers in last season's NFC wild-card game, have a top-class coaching duo in Mike Holmgren, who guided the Packers to the Super Bowl in 1996, and his former Green Bay defensive co-ordinator Ray Rhodes, who moved to the north-west last year. Seattle were unbeaten at home last season and, with their divisional rivals St Louis and San Francisco looking weaker than 12 months ago, they can top the NFC West at 8-11 with Hills, which would give them home field advantage throughout the play-offs. </p> <p>The New England Patriots, who have won the Super Bowl twice in the past three years, have been trading at a best priced 8-1 to triumph again with Stan James. The Patriots, brilliantly coached by Bill Belichick, are still a young team capable of further improvement but their odds look too short, given the strength of the opposition and the fact there have been no back-to-back Super Bowl winners for more than a decade. </p> <p>The Philadelphia Eagles, who have signed the maverick wide receiver Terrell Owens from San Francisco, are second favourites at a top-priced 10-1 with Hills. The Eagles, though, have been beaten in the NFC Championship game three years running and their coach, Andy Reid, may find it hard to shake off the losers' tag. </p> <p>The Atlantic Falcons, 28-1 with Bet365, have arguably the most talented quarterback in the NFL in the shape of Michael Vick, who was injured for much of last season. They should go well this year and may pip Carolina in the NFC South at 5-2 with Ladbrokes. Other sides capable of improvement are the Jacksonville Jaguars, who finished last season on a positive note and look over-priced to win the AFC South at 9-2 with Hills and the progressive Detroit Lions, a generous 8-1 to win the NFC North with Blue Square, compared to 11-2 elsewhere. </p> <p> <strong> Milan to win Serie A at 6-4 with Bet365.</strong> </p> <p> Carlo Ancelotti's team won the title last season by 11 points from Juventus and have since brought in Jaap Stam to boost an already strong defence. The Rossoneri have also retained Andrei Schevchenko in attack and Kaka in midfield and look worthy favourites to claim back-to-back titles. </p> <p>The potential improvers here are Milan's city rivals Internazionale, who should prosper under their talented new coach Roberto Mancini, formerly with Lazio, and are worth a saver at 4-1 with Totalbet. Inter's Brazilian striker Adriano excelled in the recent Copa America and could top score in Serie A at 6-1 with the Tote. </p> <p> <strong> Everton to draw with Manchester City in the Premiership today at 12-5 with Bet Fred.</strong> </p> <p> City defeated Charlton Athletic 4-0 in their last home game but they remain an inconsistent team. Everton are doing better than expected and followed victories over Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion with a tenacious 0-0 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford. An away win today is a top-priced 100-30 with Bet365. </p> <p> <strong> England to win the Champions Trophy at 17-2 with Bet Direct.</strong> </p> <p> Michael Vaughan's men have had a terrific summer at Test level and showed improved one-day form against India. Home advantage gives England a sporting chance of winning a possible semi-final against Australia, who may deserve to be favourites but are hardly worth backing at a best priced 6-4 with Ladbrokes, offering 6-1 and upwards the rest. New Zealand, who have an excellent one-day side, may even edge out the Australians in Pool A at 9-4 with Hills.</p>",
  "<p>I'd arranged to have lunch in Wales with a German acquaintance, a gourmet who once (very briefly) owned a Sino-Teutonic restaurant called A Wok In The Black Forest. As we drove towards Conwy, he confided that he'd now lived in this country long enough to conclude that the British are preoccupied with regulations, and are far more authoritarian than his own supposedly law-obsessed nation. </p> <p>In particular, he was appalled by the number of \"forbidden\" signs he saw everywhere (No Parking, No Waiting, No Sitting, No Standing, Keep Off The Grass, Keep Out), and by the hostile negativity of our service industries, with their unwelcoming \"wait here to be seated\" placards in restaurants, and waiters who delight in smugly responding \"It's off\" when you give them your order. \"Give a Brit a clipboard and a shred of authority,\" he told me, \"and they all turn into traffic wardens, because saying 'no' is your national sport.\" </p> <p>He proved his point when we arrived at The Groes Inn (it rhymes with Joyce), and immediately drew my attention to the child-unfriendly \"No Prams\" and \"No Pushchairs\" signs on the door (euphemisms for \"You're welcome to enter but, do us a favour, please just go away\"). From the moment we stepped inside, I regretted that there wasn't another sign saying \"No Bibelots or Knick-Knacks\", because the place was crammed to its fake half-timbered rafters with clutter and gewgaws, some of which looked as though they'd been there since the place was awarded its licence in 1573. </p> <p>Gaudy trinkets dangled from every beam, with military hats, old cooking utensils, and Victorian postcards jammed tightly against glass-encased cricket bats, and even a huge trout in a plastic frame. I also caught sight of a Welsh dresser sandwiched between a pouffe and a tallboy. God bless the Prince of Wales. </p> <p>On reaching our table, I thought nothing could be more refreshing than the \"Caesar salad with classic dressing and croutons\". And nothing would have been more refreshing, because what arrived was an even more dismal travesty of possibly the greatest dish ever to have originated in the US (well, just across the border in Tijuana, anyway) than those wretched supermarket box kits that also masquerade under the name. No heart of a romaine lettuce, no subtle whiff of garlic, no egg, no anchovy fillets, nor even a dash of Worcestershire sauce to impart an anchovy flavour. Just a few limp, wilted leaves sprinkled with too many damp croutons, and some nondescript bits of old cheese (which I ate Caerphilly), all covered with a thick coating of gunge. More of a seizure salad, really. </p> <p>My German colleague's potage was slammed down precariously on the table, and one sip confirmed that it was \"underseasoned, like most British soups\". Worse, its frothy sabayon texture suggested a recent brutal encounter with an electric food processor, and I pined for the good old days when soups like this would be tammied on a kitchenmaid's leg. The service was equally frothy, with a disingenuous faux-urgency that reminded me of those meaningless \"on hold\" telephonic phrases (\"Your call is important to us\"), but we eventually received our wine, though not the parsimonious half-bottle of Chablis we'd ordered. Germans love puns, which may be why he looked at the label, then inquired, \"Mcon for lunch?\" just as the soup was being sloshed down. </p> <p>When the main courses finally arrived, my companion's Manx kippers in butter (with added bread and butter) didn't require a lemon so much as a tub of industrial-strength Trico. Well, only a proprietorial degreasing agent could have cut through all that added fat, its cloying texture further exacerbated by the superfluous presence of mounds of bacon. </p> <p>As for my \"fisherman's pie in a creamy cheese sauce, topped with crushed potato and served with fresh vegetables\", it fell foul of my golden rule: if I can make a better fist of a dish than the chef, then the chef has clearly failed. The allegedly wild salmon had the flabby texture of the cheap, farmed variety (I blame overcooking), and was taking its final desultory swim in a vapid sauce that resembled either a split hollandaise or school custard; and where were the contrasting tastes of smoked haddock, or cod, or prawns? Bizarrely, the self-same croutons that had marred the potage and the seizure salad reappeared in bloated form in the sauce (creating a disagreeable mulchy texture).

  "Car bombs, chaotic airports and the prospect of evening tea with a warlord might make most tourists a little queasy. Not, however, 84-year-old Gertrude Lysinger. <p>\"It's been interesting\", said the grandmother from Philadelphia as her tour bus whizzed through western Afghanistan, passing murals of mujahideen martyrs and an abandoned fighter jet. </p> <p>While thousands of American soldiers are scouring Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden, for the past fortnight a dozen US tourists with an average age of 74 have been touring the country, after spurning warnings from their friends, family and the state department. </p> <p>\"My kids think we are nuts,\" admitted Richard Glenn, a 79-year-old retired college principal from Ojai, California. </p> <p>Mary Lloyd, a housewife from Phoenix, Arizona, added: \"My daughter said, 'You're flying into a war zone.

We want to get out and smell the land,\" said Dr Glenn. </p> <p>The tourists have encountered only generosity from ordinary Afghans. \"We make quite a stir wherever we go,\" said Dick Bogart, a retired computer salesman from San Francisco and grandfather of 10. \"It's been very touching.\" </p> <p>On their second day of their tour, however, a car bomb exploded half a mile from their Kabul guesthouse, killing three people. \"That was scary,\" admitted Mrs Lloyd. </p> <p>Later they travelled west to Herat, where they discovered the city had nearly been engulfed in a battle between the governor and a rival warlord two weeks earlier. Undeterred, after touring the city, they had an audience with the governor, Ismail Khan. </p> <p>\"He told us he didn't want to be called a warlord,\" said Mr Bogart. \"It was a very powerful experience.\" </p> <p>Transportation, not terrorism, has been the greatest challenge, said the tour leader Gary Wintz, 57, who last visited Afghanistan in 1978. </p> <p>\"This is one of the most difficult countries on earth,\" he said. \"But I think this is an exceptional group.\" </p> <p>The tour also prompted reflections on America's image abroad; many were openly anti-Bush. </p> <p>\"My main object in life is to get Bush out of the White House,\" said Connie Pencall, a retired teacher. \"He is a terrible, terrible man.

  "<p>As RW Johnson explained in the Sunday Times, Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier by Alexandra Fuller \"tells the story of K, a man still bearing the unhealed scars of the bitter war against black guerrillas waged by Ian Smith's white Rhodesians\". Johnson was surprised that Fuller actually lives in Wyoming. Is Africa \"where she comes to have the real emotional and literary experiences that define her identity, before scuttling back into a bland American life\"? he wondered.</p> <p>Peter Stanford in the Independent on Sunday objected that \"the will-they-won't-they tension [with K] ultimately feels a bit cheap\". \"There are plenty of damaged, stranded white people in Africa,\" announced Alexander McCall Smith in the Spectator, and \"reading about them makes one feel dirty - and sad.\"</p> <p>\"Anita Desai's The Zigzag Way is the first of her novels not set in India,\" remarked \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda Quintana in the Financial Times; nevertheless, \"her themes remain familiar: displacement, foreignness, cultural alienation\". Set in Mexico, it \"begins in Malcolm Lowry territory\", he added, \"but towards the end hurtles into the ghoulish ambit of Mexican writer Juan Rulfo\". It is \"very short\", noted Kate Chisholm in the Sunday Telegraph, \"but suggests far more than is compressed within its 182 pages.\" \"If it falls short of Desai's finest novels,\" wrote Lee Langley in the Spectator, \"The Zigzag Way still offers Desai followers her poised, immaculate prose, keen eye and skill at pinpointing a character or a mood.\"</p> <p>\"After reading [Lucy] Hughes-Hallett's accounts of heroes past, I cannot help thinking that there has been a certain debasement of what we value as heroic mettle,\" worried John Adamson in the Sunday Telegraph, reviewing Heroes: Saviours, Traitors and Supermen. Tom Holland in the Observer suspected the author had fallen under the spell of \"her rogues' gallery of charismatic masculinity\". Writing about Achilles, for instance, she \"appears to suggest it might be rather thrilling to be his slave\".</p> <p>Miffed at the exclusion of heroines, Antonia Fraser in the Sunday Times held \"an irreverent competition in my mind for the hero with whom I would least like to have a relationship\". All of them, she concluded, even El Cid. \"But who was the original hero?\" asked Victoria Glendinning in the Daily Telegraph. \"If you went back far enough, it would surely be some thrillingly huge, aggressive, sexually dominant ape.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Czeslaw Milosz 1911-2004</strong> </p> <p>For quite a while now, those who knew Czeslaw Milosz couldn't help wondering what it was going to be like when he was gone. In the meantime, he more than held his own, writing away for all he was worth in Krak\u00f3w, in his early 90s, in a flat where I'd had the privilege of visiting him twice. On the first occasion he was confined to his bed, too unwell to attend a conference arranged in his honour, and on the second he was ensconced in his living room, face to face with a life-size bronze head and torso of his second wife, Carol. His junior by some 30 years, she had died from a quick and cruel cancer in 2002, and as he sat on one side of the room facing the bronze on the other, the old poet seemed to be viewing it and everything else from another shore. On that occasion he was being ministered to by his daughter-in-law and perhaps it was her hovering attentions as much as his translated appearance that brought to mind the aged Oedipus being minded by daughters in the grove at Colonus, the old king who had arrived where he knew he would die. Colonus was not his birthplace but it was where he had come home to himself, to the world, and to the otherworld; and the same could be said of Milosz in Krak\u00f3w. </p> <p>\"The child who dwells inside us trusts that there are wise men somewhere who know the truth\": so Milosz had written, and for his many friends he himself was one of those wise men. His sayings were quoted, even when they were wisecracks rather than wisdom. A few days before he died I'd had a letter from Robert Pinsky, telling of a visit last month to the hospital where Czeslaw was a patient. \"How are you?\" Pinsky asked. \"Conscious,\" was the reply. \"My head is full of absurd bric-a-brac.\" It was the first time I'd ever detected a daunted note in any of his utterances. A couple of years earlier, for example, a similar inquiry from Pinsky's fellow translator, Robert Hass, had elicited the reply, \"I survive by incantation\" - which was more like him. His life and works were founded upon faith in \"A word wakened by lips that perish\". This first artistic principle was clearly related to the last gospel of the Mass, the In principio of St John: \"In the beginning was the Word\". Inexorably then, through his pursuit of poetic vocation, his study of what such pursuit entailed and the unremitting, abounding yield of his habit of composition, he developed a fierce conviction about the holy force of his art, how poetry was called upon to combat death and nothingness, to be \"A tireless messenger who runs and runs / Through interstellar fields, through revolving galaxies, / And calls out, protests, screams\" (\"Meaning\"). With Milosz gone, the world has lost a credible witness to this immemorial belief in the saving power of poetry. </p> <p>His credibility was and remains the thing. There was nothing disingenuous about his professions of faith in poetry, which he once called philosophy's \"ally in the service of the good\", news that \"was brought to the mountains by a unicorn and an echo\". Such trust in the delicious joy-bringing potential of art and intellect was protected by strong bulwarks built from the knowledge and experience that he had gained at first hand and at great cost. His mind, to put it another way, was at once a garden - now a monastery garden, now a garden of earthly delights -and a citadel. The fortifications surrounding the garden were situated on a high mountain whence he could view the kingdoms of the world, recognise their temptations and their tragedies, and communicate to his readers both the airiness and the insights that his situation afforded. Somewhere, for example, he compares a poem to a bridge built out of air over air, and one of the great delights of his work is a corresponding sensation of invigilating reality from a head-clearing perspective, being liberated into the authentic solitude of one's own being and at the same time being given gratifying spiritual companionship, so that one is ready to say something like \"It is good for us to be here\". </p> <p>Milosz was well aware of this aspect of his work and explicit about his wish that poetry in general should be capable of providing such an elevated plane of regard. Yet as if to prove the truth of WB Yeats's contention that without contrarieties there could be no progression, he was equally emphatic about poetry's need to descend from its high vantage point and creep about among the nomads on the plain. It was not enough that the poet should be like Venus in WH Auden's poem \"The Shield of Achilles\", looking over the shoulder of his artefact at a far-off panorama that included everything from kitchen comedy to genocide. The poet had to be down there with the ordinary crowd, at eye level with the refugee family on the floor of the railway station, sharing the smell of the stale crusts the mother is doling out to her youngsters even as the boots of the military patrol bear down on them, the city is bombarded, and maps and memories go up in flames. Awareness of the triteness and tribulations of other people's lives was needed to humanise the song. It wasn't enough to be in the salons of the avant-garde. Certain things, as he says in \"1945\", could not be learned \"from Apollinaire, / Or Cubist manifestoes, or the festivals of Paris streets\". Milosz would have deeply understood and utterly agreed with John Keats's contention that the use of a world of pain and troubles was to school the intelligence and make it a soul. The discharged soldier of \"1945\" has received just such a schooling: </p> <p>&#xa0;\"On the steppe, as he was binding his bleeding feet with a rag </p> <p>&#xa0;He grasped the futile pride of those lofty generations. </p> <p>&#xa0;As far as he could see, a flat, unredeemed earth. </p> <p>&#xa0;And what, in these drastic conditions, has the poet to offer? Only what has accrued to him through custom and ceremony, through civilisation: </p> <p>&#xa0;I blinked, ridiculous and rebellious, </p> <p>&#xa0;Along with my Jesus Mary against irrefutable power, </p> <p>&#xa0;A descendant of ardent prayers, of gilded sculptures and miracles.\"</p> <p>Tender towards innocence, tough-minded when faced with brutality and injustice, Milosz could be at one moment susceptible, at another remorseless. Now he is evoking the dewy eroticism of some adolescent girl haunting the grounds of a Lithuanian manor house, now he is anatomising the traits of character and misdirected creative gifts that led some contemporary into the Marxist web. From start to finish, merciless analytic power coexisted with helpless sensuous relish. He recollects the fresh bread smells on the streets of Paris when he was a student at the same moment as he summons up the faces of fellow students from Indo-china, young revolutionaries preparing to seize power and \"kill in the name of the universal beautiful ideas\". </p> <p>No doubt the intensity of his early religious training contributed to his capacity to let perpetual light shine upon the quotidian, yet this religious poet was inhabited by another who was, in a very precise sense, a secular Milosz, one afflicted by the atrociousness of the saeculum he was fated to live through. The word \"century\" usually preceded by the definite article or the possessive pronoun, first person singular, repeats and echoes all through his writing. It was as if he couldn't go anywhere without encountering, as he does in his poem, \"A Treaty on Poetry\", \"The Spirit of History... out walking\", wearing \"About his neck a chain of severed heads\". And it was his face-to-face encounters and contentions with this \"inferior god\" that darkened his understanding and endowed everything he wrote with grievous force. </p> <p>His intellectual life could be viewed as a long single combat with shapeshifting untruth. \"The New Faith\" upon which the communist regimes were founded was like the old man of the sea, a villainous fallacious Proteus who had to be watched, wrestled with, held down and made to submit. Just how much stamina and precision this entailed can be seen in the almost inquisitorial prosecution of argument and accusation which characterises The Captive Mind, the book he introduced like a bell and candle between himself and his Polish contemporaries who had succumbed to the Marxist tempters. The sense of personal majesty that developed around him in old age derived in no small measure from his having survived this ordeal, which had sprung him into solitude and left him a wanderer, as capable in the end of self-accusation as he had ever been of accusation. </p> <p>Once, after a poetry reading in Harvard where he had seemed, as I later wrote, to combine the roles of Orpheus and Tiresias, he said to me: \"I feel just like a little boy, playing on the bank of a river.\" And the poems convinced you that here too he was telling the truth. In fact, Milosz gave the lie to TS Eliot's line that human kind cannot bear very much reality. The young poet who started out with his peers in the caf\u00e9s and controversies of 1930s Warsaw was present when those same young poets were dying in gunfire during the Warsaw Rising, their memorials little more than graffiti in the rubble of the devastated city. The old man, the sage of Grizzly Peak Road in Berkeley, veteran of the cold war, hero of Solidarity, friend of the pope, was at once the child \"who receives First Communion in Wilno and afterwards drinks cocoa served by zealous Catholic ladies\" and the poet who constantly heard \"the immense call of the Particular, despite the earthly law that sentences memory to extinction\" (\"Capri\"). </p> <p>I know Milosz's poems only in translation, but they come through so convincingly in the \"target language\" you forget that their first life is in Polish. Reading him in English, you are in thrall to a unique voice, a poetry cargoed with a density of experience that has been lived through and radiated by an understanding that has rendered it symbolic. It's not just that one trusts the ear and the accuracy of those poets who have done the translating, although their contributions in this regard have been indispensable. It's more that one can hardly not intuit the sheer weight of human presence, prose content and musical transmission that must subsist in the original away beyond our linguistic reach. The poetry as a whole is eminently comprehensible, equally well supplied with occasions of surprise and recognition. It can move from sumptuous evocation to solo articulation. Its easy-as-breathing cadences, its often unexpected simplicity (as in a bewitching early poem such as \"Encounter\") and its equally unexpected but persuasive obliquity (\"Far West\", for instance), convince you of the truth, of Milosz's frequent claim that his poems were dictated by a daimon, that he was merely a \"secretary\". Which was another way of saying that he had learned to write fast, to allow the associative jumps to be taken at a hurdler's pace. When he tells us that his poem \"Ars Poetica?\" was written in 20 minutes, I believe him and rejoice. </p> <p>Part of the secret and much of the power came from his immense learning. His head was like one of those renaissance theatres of memory. Schoolboy Latin, Thomist theology, Russian philosophy, world poetry, 20th-century history, the dramatis personae of the age, many of whom were his close companions - you have only to read a few pages of his copious prose to realise how present all of this was to him, and how flimsy and inadequate the old clich\u00e9, \"a well-stocked mind\", turns out to be in his case. The poetry is the fine flower of an oeuvre that extends to autobiography, political argu ment, literary criticism, personal essays, fictions, maxims, memoirs, and much else that is original, frolicsome, ominous, more or less unclassifiable. 0ther poets have written voluminous prose. Among his near contemporaries in English one can think of Hugh Macdiarmid and WH Auden, both gifted with vigorous intelligence and a rage for order. By comparison, however, Macdiarmid, for all his compendiousness, seems to protest too much. Auden is closer, in that he too is compelled to examine the middle state of human life and can never forget the border states of beast and angel. Yet compared with Milosz, Auden tends towards don-speak, doesn't appear to suffer as much from the complicating drag of the contingent: you get serious speculation but it tends to lack the interesting impairment of specific personal gravity. I love Milosz because there is such a guarantee in his tone, a guarantee that the performative prose-writing persona is being kept under constant scrutiny by a more penitent, more punitive side of himself. What we get in the prose, as in the poetry, is the speech of the whole man. </p> <p>And yet Milosz was always impatient with \"the insufficiency of lyric\", as the poet Donald Davie expressed it, and indeed the insufficiency of all art, deeply conscious of the unattainability of the reality that surrounds us. His yearning for a more encompassing form of expression than is humanly available was a theme to which he returned again and again. \"Arranging colours on a canvas is a paltry thing compared with what calls out to be explored.\" Yet he also exulted in the certainty that he was called as a poet \"to glorify things just because they are\", and maintained that \"the ideal life for a poet is to contemplate the word is \". In pursuit of this ideal, he brought poetry beyond the chalk circle of significant form and opened it to big vistas and small domesticities: his poems sometimes have the head-on exclamatory innocence of child art (\"O happiness! To see an iris\"), sometimes the panoramic sweep of synoptic historical meditation, as in \"Oeconomia Divina\": \"I did not expect to live in such an unusual moment... / Roads on concrete pillars, cities of glass and cast iron, / airfields larger than tribal dominions / suddenly ran short of their essence and disintegrated... / Out of trees, field stones, even lemons on the table, / materiality escaped\". Yet by diagnosing the onset of this lightness of being Milosz effectively halted it for his readers, and much of his staying power as a poet will continue to reside in his exemplary obstinacy, his refusal to underprize the thickness of the actual and the sovereign value that can inhere in what we choose to remember. \"What is pronounced strengthens itself. / What is not pronounced tends to nonexistence\" (\"Reading the Japanese Poet Issa\"). </p> <p>Thinking of Czeslaw during these past months, seeing him in my mind's eye marooned on his bed, visited by friends yet always with his eye fixed steadily on the life-obliterating wall ahead, I couldn't help but see him also in the light of two works of art that have about them a typically Miloszian combination of solidity and spiritual force. The first is Jacques Louis David's painting, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of the death of Socrates. The sturdily built philosopher is on his high bed, bare to the waist, finger in the air, sitting upright and expounding to his crowd of friends the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. The picture could well carry as an alternative title or caption the words: \"I permitted myself everything except complaints\" - a remark made by Joseph Brodsky, one which Milosz quoted with high approval and which could apply with equal justice to Milosz himself. And the other work, probably brought to mind by that tableau of Milosz face-to-face with the bronze likeness of his wife Carol, is an Etruscan sarcophagus in the Louvre, a mighty terracotta sculpture of a married couple, reclining on their elbows. The woman is positioned on the man's left side, couched close and parallel, both of them at their ease and gazing intently ahead at something which by all the rules of perspective should be visible in the man's outstretched right hand. But there is nothing to be seen there. Was it a bird that has flown? A flower that has been snapped away? A bird that is approaching? Nothing is shown, yet their gaze is full of realisation, as if they are in the process of settling for the bittersweet answer Milosz provided to his own question to life (in \"No More\"): </p> <p>&#xa0;\"Out of reluctant matter </p> <p>&#xa0;What can be gathered? Nothing, beauty at best. </p> <p>&#xa0;And so, cherry blossoms must suffice for us </p> <p>&#xa0;And chrysanthemums and the full moon.\"</p> <p>I was in our back garden, in sunlight, among flowers, when the call came. There was a fullness about the morning that was Californian. An unshadowedness that recalled his poem \"Gift\", written in Berkeley when he was 60: \"A day so happy. / Fog lifted early; I worked in the garden. / Hummingbirds were stopping over honeysuckle flowers...\" Thanksgiving and admiration were in the air, and I could easily have repeated to myself the remark he once made to an interviewer, commenting upon his epigram, \"He was thankful, so he couldn't not believe in God\". Ultimately, Milosz declared, \"one can believe in God out of gratitude for all the gifts\". So when the cordless phone was carried out and I heard the voice of Jerzy Jarniewicz, I knew what the news would be, but because I had been long prepared, I wasn't knocked askew. Instead, there was an expanding of grief into the everlasting reach of poetry. In the Dublin sunlight, the figure of the poet in his hillside garden above San Francisco Bay merged with the figure of Oedipus toiling up the wooded slope at Colonus, only to disappear in the blink of an eye: when I looked he was there in all his human bulk and devotion, when I looked again he was not to be seen - and yet he was not entirely absent. There and then I could have repeated the words of Sophocles's Messenger as he reports the incident which for all its mysteriousness has the ring of a common truth: </p> <p>&#xa0;\"He was gone from sight: </p> <p>&#xa0;That much I could see... </p> <p>&#xa0;No god had galloped </p> <p>&#xa0;His thunder chariot, no hurricane </p> <p>&#xa0;Had swept the hill. Call me mad, if you like, </p> <p>&#xa0;Or gullible, but that man surely went </p> <p>&#xa0;In step with a guide he trusted down to where </p> <p>&#xa0;Light has gone out but the door stands open.\"</p> <p>\u00a9 Seamus Heaney</p>",
  "<p>The Jamaican prime minister, PJ Patterson, declared a state of emergency and pleaded with half a million people living in vulnerable areas to leave their homes as Hurricane Ivan raced towards the island last night. </p> <p>\"Residents living near coastal areas must evacuate before it's too late,\" Mr Patterson said in an address to the nation. \"I cannot stress too strongly that Ivan is a dangerous hurricane. What we're experiencing now is only the beginning.\" </p> <p>Seven-metre waves, thunderstorms and flooding preceded the eye of the hurricane, which was due to pass over Jamaica before heading to Cuba and Florida. </p> <p>The government opened more than 1,000 emergency shelters, and urged the evacuation of 500,000 people in low-lying coastal communities, flood zones and shanty towns. But although the banks closed and shops ran out of basic supplies yesterday afternoon, few people made their way to the shelters, preferring to secure their roofs and wait at home. </p> <p>Only about 1,200 people had moved into the shelters around Kingston, the emer gency management director, Barbara Carby, said, adding that people feared looting. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying I'm not afraid for my life, but we've got to stay here and protect our things,\" said Lorna Brown, 49, pointing to a stove, television, cooking utensils and large bed crowded into a one-room concrete home on the beach at Montego Bay. </p> <p>Mrs Carby said that although there was concern about the ability of buildings to withstand 160mph winds, her greatest concern was the 3-5 metre (10-15ft) storm surges and flooding projected for coastal communities. </p> <p>Last night, waves two-storeys high lashed the island's eastern shore, flooding homes and washing away roads. </p> <p>Onlookers stood transfixed near Kingston's airport as 7 metre (23ft) waves crashed to shore, flinging rocks and tree branches more than 30 metres into the road. </p> <p>\"I've lived here all my life and I've never seen anything like this,\" said a businessman, Chester Pinnock. \"This is going to be disastrous, we could have hundreds dead.\" </p> <p>Last night the country was shut off from the outside world. Flights were cancelled and Air Jamaica parked its planes in the United States. </p> <p>Hundreds of British holidaymakers were airlifted to the Dominican Republic for safety. </p> <p>The Jamaican police went on emergency alert, fearing widespread looting, and a Royal Navy ship, HMS Richmond, sailed for the island to offer vital aid. </p> <p>Ivan, the most destructive hurricane in the Caribbean for more than 10 years, has already killed 33 people. </p> <p>The toll includes 22 in Grenada, including two unidentified foreigners from a yacht, one in Tobago, four in Venezuela, a Canadian woman in Barbados and four youngsters in the Dominican Republic, who were swept away by a giant wave even though the storm was 200 miles away. </p> <p>Cuba declared a hurricane watch across the entire island. President Fidel Castro went on national television warning residents to brace themselves. \"Whatever the hurricane does, we will all work together\" to rebuild, he said. </p> <p>Although it has caused havoc all over the Caribbean, its most deadly effects so far have been felt in Grenada, where the capital, St George's, was devastated. </p> <p>Many prisoners escaped when the jail was damaged. Hundreds of looters smashed storm shutters and shop windows to take televisions and shopping trolleys of food. Some carried away bed frames and mattresses. </p> <p>Ivan will be the third hurricane to pass through the area in a month, hammering both the Caribbean and Florida. </p> <p>Three hurricanes closely following one another in one sea son is rare and there is still time for more this year. </p> <p>This is exactly the sort of phenomenon that scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fear may be the result of warmer sea temperatures - more violent and frequent storms. </p> <p>Last year gave the South Atlantic its first hurricane, a surprise to meteorologists, and something many had thought would never happen. </p> <p>In Florida, residents stopped clearing up the debris from hurricanes Charley and Frances to flee Ivan, pausing to join long queues once again at DIY stores and petrol stations. </p> <p>\"We've all been through this trilogy. It's no fun, but you do what you've got to do,\" Jane Fry told the Associated Press as she loaded supplies into her car. </p> <p>There was still hope that the winds might veer west and hit the Gulf of Mexico. But if Ivan does land in Florida it could add to the death toll of 43 and the damage bill of $20bn (\u00a311bn) in the past few weeks.</p>",
