  "The body that determines if terrorist ceasefires have been broken in Northern Ireland is set to deal a damaging blow to the prospects for restoring devolution in the Province. <p>The International Monitoring Commission is expected to point the finger at the Provisional IRA over the theft of more than two million pounds' worth of cigarettes in Belfast last month. </p> <p>Their report comes amid fresh evidence of ongoing IRA activity, including robberies and allegations of intelligence gathering on both sides of the Irish border. </p> <p>A non-jury court case running in Dublin has also thrown up allegations of an IRA spy ring directed at senior politicians in the Republic. </p> <p>However, both the British and Irish governments remain highly optimistic about a major act of IRA decommissioning in the next few weeks. John de Chastelain, the Canadian general overseeing the destruction of IRA and loyalist arms, briefed the Irish government this weekend over progress towards decommissioning. </p> <p>Last night a prominent unionist predicted that if the IMC reported ongoing IRA activity it would have serious implications for the chances of a deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists aimed to restoring powersharing government. </p> <p>Jeffrey Donaldson, the Lagan Valley MP, said that the IMC report would make it all the more difficult for a deal to be done this autumn. </p> <p>'The IMC report will say, I predict, that terrorist activity is winding down,' he said. 'But there is ongoing criminality. There can't be a future without paramilitarism unless all aspects of it, including criminality, ends.' </p> <p>Sources close to the IMC told The Observer that the body would blame PIRA for the robbery of more than \u00a32 million worth of cigarettes last month. During the heist a lorry driver and his family were held captive in their native Ardoyne, a republican stronghold in north Belfast. </p> <p>'No one else but the Provos would have the organisation, sophistication and ability to distribute the stolen cigarettes,' said one source. 'Nor would anyone else dare hold a family captive in Ardoyne but them.' </p> <p>The IMC's findings will be based on a report from the Chief Constable Hugh Orde. So far the PSNI chief has refused to publish his report or state which terror group was responsible. </p> <p>Orde has been challenged by members of the North's Policing Board to publish the findings of the PSNI investigation before the IMC report. </p> <p>The British government had been hoping that a second IMC report would bolster the chances of a political deal. It is understood the IMC will conclude terrorist activity over the past six months has significantly diminished. </p> <p>In Dublin, meanwhile, there has been fierce resistance and heavy briefing against the IMC investigating IRA activity in the Republic. Sources close to the IMC claim that senior figures in the Department of Foreign Affairs are questioning whether the IMC should even have an office and investigative capacity south of the border. 'They don't want the IMC talking to garda officers or the alleged victims of punishment shootings in Dublin for fear what they might find. They are openly asking why we need an IMC office in the Republic at all.' </p> <p>At Dublin's Special Criminal Court the trial continues tomorrow of a Crumlin man accused of IRA membership. Niall Binead also stands accused of having the personal details of several TDs including a minister in the last Cabinet as well as 30 unnamed individuals. </p> <p>Last week prosecuting counsel George Birmingham SC told the court that the documents found in the briefcase at the home of Niall Binead 'related to the activities and movements of a number of elected representatives, members of Dail Eireann from different political parties'. </p> <p>Niall Binead, also known as Niall Bennett, 35, of Faughart Road, Crumlin, and Kenneth Donohue, 26, of Sundale Avenue, Mountain View, Tallaght, have pleaded not guilty to membership of an illegal organisation styling itself the Irish Republican Army, otherwise Oglaigh na hEireann, otherwise the IRA, on 10 October, 2002.</p>",
  "<p>Sat in Mr Luck's office in Bangkok surrounded by six Thai women, Stephen couldn't believe it. They were aged from 25 to 29 and all as beautiful as each other. And each one seemed mesmerised, grinning at him, laughing, smiling. And one of them, it turned out, would end up being his wife.</p> <p>He was in his late forties, a mechanic who worked as a contractor for the US Army. Born in the one-horse town of Middlewich, Cheshire, he had two failed marriages behind him. The first wife had run off with another man; he'd got custody of the two girls, aged four and seven. Next time he was hoping for something better. The thing was, he was a good-looking guy. And as he grew older he kept his looks, so he figured, but the women his age were losing theirs. </p> <p>The advert had been in the back of Exchange &amp; Mart. There'd been a few for Thai and Filipino wives. So he sent away for the brochures and videotapes and spent months writing letters. </p> <p>But Charles Black of Siam Introductions said: 'Go to Thailand. The early bird gets the worm. When you get there you'll be overwhelmed.'</p> <p>And he was. The fee was \u00a3900 to Mr Black, and the same to his Thai associate, Mr Luck. And there he was, the day after, flying into Bangkok, in Mr Luck's office, surrounded by beautiful women. </p> <p>He took them out, one by one, for meals, for trips arranged by Mr Luck. He's not the sort of man to admit to emotions but, motoring up-river past gilded temples, the beauty of Thailand took him aback so much that he almost cried. </p> <p>In the end it was the 29-year-old Kallaya who won him. She had rung Mr Luck every day to ask him, 'Has he chosen yet?' And working as a civil servant, she spoke really good English. </p> <p>She agreed to come to Germany with him. There was a hitch. To obtain the necessary fiancee visa Steve needed paperwork to demonstrate that he'd been divorced twice and could legally marry Kallaya. He called his mum.</p> <p>Now most men who find a Thai bride find themselves lying when they get back home. 'I was on holiday. She was a receptionist at the hotel...' So when Steve phoned his mother in Middlewich he told her he was in Spain - that he'd met someone there. And that worked until two couples from Middlewich on their way back from Australia turned up at the Ambassador Hotel where he was staying. 'Hey up, Steve!'</p> <p>Would you believe it? 'Whatever you do - don't tell my mother you've seen me.' Did they? Of course they did. So it all came out. </p> <p>Steve and Kallaya married in Germany, where he was working, on 15 August 2002. But they're setting up home together in Thailand. That was unexpected. All he'd intended to find was a wife, but he's fallen in love with the country, too. Four weeks ago they had a baby, Mark. He is beautiful. His daughters have been out to visit, too; Steve says they love Kallaya to bits. </p> <p>He missed his son's birth. He was working for the US in Kuwait. He's looking forward to living in Thailand. The man from Middlewich already knows German and Arabic; he's learning Thai. Kallaya hopes he won't master it; that way, she jokes, she'll be able to talk to her friends about him without him knowing what she is saying.</p> <p>Sometimes he sees the English in Bangkok bars like the Diana Dragon. They come over in their forties and fifties. They can have a different woman every hour if they want. Some do until their money runs out. But them guys, they're not his type. He has Kallaya. She's enough for him. OM</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Superhero for Hire: True Stories from the Small Ads by William Shaw is published by Observer Books, priced \u00a39.99.

  "<p>Here they come. They have been called, but the movement is hardly noticeable at first. People shuffling along rows of seats, excuse me, ma'am, excuse me, sir, in ones and twos. Married couples in matching shirts holding hands. Now, some groups of giggling teenage girls, wondering if they should, smoothing their hair, checking their bags. Young men holding Bibles. Enormous people in outsize shorts, following their bellies, manoeuvring gargantuan backsides through gaps in the crowd, gripping half-gallons of Coke. People with sticks, on the arms of carers, watching every step. A silent army descending solemnly in bright white Reeboks and Nikes. </p> <p>Soon the first few make it down on to the magic green of the floodlit grass of Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs. They are drawn to the centre, the few joining with others, the luminous turf steadily covered. At either end of the stadium - a great concrete oval of orange plastic seating soaring up to the black night sky - on enormous flat screens a vast face is watching their progress, unmoving. </p> <p>It is a face that demands to be on a stamp, or the back of a dollar bill, or carved into rock: the slightly hook nose, the firm jaw, the eyes darting under heavy brows, the silver hair swept back just so. It is a face that has been on screens just like these, framed by advertisements for Budweiser and Pizza Hut and First National Bank, all over the world. A face that created this very spectacle 60 years ago, has seen it unfold inevitably a thousand times and never tired of it. Occasionally, a hand, shaking now a little with Parkinson's and age, moves up to those huge projected eyes, as if maybe ( who knows? ) to stop a tear in its tracks. </p> <p>This is the third night of Billy Graham's crusade to Kansas City, to the heart of the heart of America, and the numbers of the saved are slowly growing. Evangelists normally love lightning - apocalyptic forks of it appear on the covers of several of Graham's million-selling books, including Storm Warning and Approaching Hoofbeats - but on the first night of this mission, violent thunder had kept the attendance down to a handful hunkered under stadium overhangs in polythene capes. 'Hell,' as Robert Frost once observed, 'is a half filled auditorium.' </p> <p>Tonight, though, the banked seats are full and Graham can mould that initial adversity, the heavenly downpour, into his sermon, just as he can talk of the great natural disasters that have spared him this year: how he and his family endured at their home in North Carolina hurricanes Ivan and Jean; how 169 bridges were swept away from their neighbouring valleys; how a huge mudslide passed within 12 feet of their timber house; how they lost their generator and lived in darkness for several days, Graham himself bedbound recovering from a broken pelvis. And so on. Until it is hard not to believe, as bright-eyed people have been telling me all evening, that it is a miracle the 'America's pastor' is here at all. </p> <p>That opening night was the first time Graham had preached to an audience all year. 'I feel,' he said, his rich voice cracking a little, ever the showman, 'like a teenager. Like I'm starting over.' </p> <p>He approaches the microphone these days, at 85, on a Zimmer frame, helped by his son. He pauses halfway through his text, a loose aggregation of good ol' boy anecdote and scaremongering scripture, to take a seat. As he watches the people come on down to be born again, he leans forward every now and then to remind them of the urgency of the moment, the lateness of the hour. And all the time he speaks, as his volunteer tellers take the names of those baseball-capped souls who will, no doubt, be joining him in paradise, you are invited to think of the numbers whose names have been entered in this way before, of all the statistics that stack up behind him. </p> <p>America loves zeroes and, if nothing else, Billy Graham provides the reassurance of noughts, the comforting economies of scale. This is his 435th Crusade; he has preached live to 210 million people in 185 countries; more than any man who ever lived. He has provided guidance for almost every American President since Truman. He was Nixon's close confidant, Reagan's devout ally. He stood at George Bush senior's side, Bible in hand, when the President launched Operation Desert Storm. He helped George W Bush through his drinking problems. He has more appearances on Time magazine's annual list of the 10 most admired people in the world - 46 - than anyone else. </p> <p>Though these facts come thick and fast, it is another of the evening's big numbers that gives me particular pause. Each night in Kansas City, the Crusade proceedings are opened with a brisk bit of business. This four-day event will cost, we are told, $4.8 million. This is to be raised by donations. 'Pull the envelope out of your programme, pay by credit card, write a cheque or simply put cash in it,' says one of Billy's sharp-suited warm-up men. 'Better still, just give us your wallet,' he suggests, before adding, 'I'm kidding about that last one.' </p> <p>The faithful may have only to walk out on to a football field to ensure ever lasting life, but, it seems, salvation does not come cheap. As the lines of people file down I do a quick calculation. Each saved soul is currently coming in at about $750 a pop. </p> <p>Then, as soon as the God-fearing men and women of Kansas are assembled, Billy Graham gets up, his work complete. Tomorrow, he says, he'll talk about 'the Day of Judgment, and about the great tribulation of the end times when some will be taken up to heaven and many will be left behind'. 'It should,' as Graham's sidekick of 50 years, Cliff Barrow, points out, 'be a very enjoyable afternoon. Bring your friends!' </p> <p>In essayist Thomas Frank's book, What's the Matter With Kansas? (published here as What's the Matter with America?) , he explores the reasons why the American heartland and, particularly, his home city, has turned so resolutely to God and the right. Historically, Kansas is a blue-collar state, the most 'normal' place in America, where Superman grew up and where Dorothy yearned to return. These days, conservative commentators like to call Kansas City the capital of 'red America', the great swath of the country that has come out in recent elections for Republicans and shows up crimson on electoral maps. It is, for them, a 'region of humility, guilelessness, and, above all, of stout yeoman righteousness ' as compared to the blue of the coastal conurbations, where people are 'unobservant, liberal-minded, relativistic'. </p> <p>David Brooks, writing approvingly in the Atlantic Monthly , described the population of red America as 'perfectly happy to be slightly overweight and a little underpaid'. Ann Coulter, the author of the number one bestseller How to talk to a Liberal (If you must), calls Kansas City her 'favourite place in the world ... they're Americans, they are great, they are rooting for America. I mean, there is so much common sense!' Billy Graham shares this feeling: 'You are the best people in America!' he repeatedly tells his heartland audience, by which he means, really, you are the best people in the world. </p> <p>'Kansas,' Thomas Frank argues, 'may be the land of averageness, but it is a freaky, militant, outraged averageness.' The Kansas state-school board has cleansed the curriculum of the necessity of teaching evolution. Public events, including the Billy Graham Crusades, are picketed by people with banners proclaiming that God Hates Fags. Pro-life spectaculars are routine. There is something very appropriate about the fact that Kansas City's biggest export is Hallmark Cards, flogging overpriced platitudes to the world (the Hall family, who own the company, are the Republicans' biggest donors in the state). </p> <p>In this climate, Graham's brand of commercial self-righteousness plays perfectly. ('God,' as Frank says, 'meets Mammon'). The evangelist, I am repeatedly told, is the 'real deal', progenitor of any number of similar Christian enterprises, but the original and still the best. He offers a version of Christianity which is shaped to fit American capitalism and individualism and, moreover, which supports a traditional, parochial American way of life and American power in the world. </p> <p>He is not so much a preacher as a broker offering stock options in God's corporate plan. Unlike most pastors, he does not have to bury the dead, perform weddings or organise bring and buy sales. 'I would love to see you all for a cup of tea,' he says to those who come forward, 'but we will have plenty of time for that in heaven.' </p> <p>What he - and the rest of his far more wacko imitators - offers to the heartland is certainty and safety, as well as a sense of affirmation of their morals. This sense of shared value is more a style than a rigorous programme. Frank argues that of all the divides in America, the key one is between the perceived authenticity of tradition-minded red America and its godless liberal nemesis. 'While liberals commit endless acts of hubris, sucking down lattes, driving European cars, trying to reform the world, the humble people of the red states go about their unpretentious business, eating down-home foods, whistling while they work and knowing they are secure under the watch of George W Bush, a man they love as one of their own.' </p> <p>The great lie of this position, Frank argues, is that Bush has done more to undermine those traditional American values, by pandering to vast corporations, by slashing the tax burden of the rich, by rushing America to war, than almost any President in history. In this, though, Bush is convinced, he has God (and Billy Graham) on his side. Rarely has it been more straightforward for a rich man to feel eligible for a celestial upgrade than in Bush's America. </p> <p>At 85, Billy Graham is planning just two more Crusades, one in Los Angeles next month and one in New York next year. Then he will see how he feels and probably hand all of the work over to his son, Franklin. This process of the succession has already begun. Franklin is 'CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association', which has just moved into a new $13m headquarters in North Carolina (and which has an annual turnover, used mainly to run its Crusades, of $109m). He draws a 'modest' salary of around $200,000 (his father, reluctantly, takes a little more) plus the use of the corporate plane, which he flies across the globe. He provided the blessing at the inauguration of Bush, just as his father had blessed Bush's father. </p> <p>In a hotel room in Kansas City, I ask Franklin Graham if he feels ready to take on his father's work. </p> <p>'Well,' he says, in his quiet, measured voice, 'nobody can take his place in the world. But I have already done 100 Crusades of my own.' He is off to Nova Scotia in a couple of weeks, then Chile, and so on. </p> <p>Does he share his father's love of the heartland? </p> <p>'People can come and visit New York,' he says. 'But that is not America. Los Angeles is not America. These small places are America: a good work ethic, where people will take care of themselves. And where they live by Christian values.' </p> <p>I wonder if he sees that divide in political terms? </p> <p>'The difference between the political system in this country and many others is that religion is a big part of our life. The media in our country are mostly liberal and they have their ideas. But we have ours.' </p> <p>Franklin Graham became notorious in the first Gulf War by sending thousands of GIs biblical tracts in Arabic, to spread the word among their Saudi hosts. General Norman Schwarzkopf, trying to keep peace with Riyadh, was outraged. Does he regret that? </p> <p>'Here's my feeling,' he says. 'Saudi Arabia asks the United States to come in. But while the Saudis were willing for the blood of American soldiers to be spilled to save their oil fields, US army chaplains were asked to take the cross off their uniforms. I thought that was wrong. The Saudis gave every American soldier material to introduce them to Islam, and I thought we had every right to tell the Saudis what we believe.' </p> <p>Since the inauguration, he says, he has maintained a very close relationship with the current President. </p> <p>'I'm at the White House next week to do a Bible study for the President's staff,' he says. 'I speak to the President's advisers on issues all the time.' </p> <p>Graham has been most involved with formulating the Bush administration's policy on HIV/Aids. It was he who helped to secure the surprise $15 billion earmarked to address the disease worldwide and it was he who helped to shape a policy which favours the preaching of sexual abstinence over the distribution of condoms. </p> <p>'We [should] obey God and his laws,' he says in this regard. 'God has given sex to be used between a man and a woman in marriage, not between two women, not between two men. [If you deviate] sooner or later it is going to destroy your health. It could end your life.' (To protect himself from such temptations of the flesh, like every other man in the Billy Graham organisation, he never allows himself to be alone in a room with a woman other than his wife, Jane Austin, whom he married soon after he was 'born again'.) </p> <p>It is not clear quite how much advice Franklin Graham offers to the White House on foreign policy, though he says he has helped to shape thinking on Sudan, which he has visited on Crusades. After 9/11, he infamously denounced Islam as 'an evil and wicked religion'. I wonder if he stands by that? </p> <p>'It is certainly a very violent religion,' he says. 'You hear the calls from the mullahs every day on the internet. The vast majority are calling for the death of Jews, the killing of Christians. I have not heard one Anglican or one Baptist say we should kill Muslims.' </p> <p>Does he therefore see the current conflict as a struggle between good and evil as his President appears to? </p> <p>'We are in a Third World War. Tony Blair understands that. George Bush understands that. It is a global fight against Islamic fundamentalism.' </p> <p>And do such events, in his opinion, signify the imminent approach of a Judgment Day? </p> <p>'Certainly. I think Judgment Day is approaching fast. I think there are major prophecies that have been fulfilled. The rebirth of Israel. All of this was foretold. The great tribulation will come then. And this world will be judged for rejecting Jesus Christ. In America now, you cannot mention His name on television, you cannot teach the Bible in school, but you can talk of Muhammad all you want. Why is that? Because the great tribulation is coming. The true followers of Jesus will be taken up and the remainder left behind. </p> <p>Does he feel ready for Judgment Day? </p> <p>Franklin Graham flashes a quiet smile, as if the answer were self-evident. </p> <p>There is a measure by which Americans can determine how close we are to the Last Days. They can just log on to the RaptureReady website which monitors the world's press and comes up with a daily 'rapture index'. On the final day of Graham's Crusade, appropriately enough, this index is at an annual high of 155, owing to a couple of reported earthquakes. On the bus to Arrowhead Stadium, along a flat road on which Baptist churches stand side by side with truckstop lap-dancing bars, this sense of impending doom is almost palpable. Particularly for the one man who has turned up with a Kerry/Edwards badge on his coat. </p> <p>'The one thing that Kerry hasn't shown is how he is going to secure America,' the man is told, when he sits down. 'He keeps getting asked, but he doesn't know. He's a flip-flopper.' </p> <p>'At least,' another says, with some certainty, 'Bush doesn't lie to us.' </p> <p>'How can you tell when a liberal is lying?' another wonders, by way of a joke. 'When he opens his mouth.' </p> <p>The man with the badge points quietly to the President's failures in Iraq. </p> <p>'There's more people get killed every day on the freeway than soldiers getting killed in Iraq.' </p> <p>He mentions the trillions of dollars racked up in budget deficit. </p> <p>'You have got to keep a positive approach to life. If you don't, you are going to miss so much about America.' </p> <p>The chief defender of the President's record in this one-sided debate is a man wearing a jacket emblazoned with the logo of the Smiling Bus Chapel, of which he is the proprietor. The Smiling Bus Chapel, he explains, will tour from Minnesota to Texas, saving souls at Greyhound stations and truckstops. It will have an altar and pews on board, as well as 'satellite communications'. </p> <p>'I want American people in heaven,' he explains of his mission. 'The Lord told me to make it easy for people. Billy Graham started all of this, by bringing God out of the church. I make it even easier by coming to them. I tell them they don't have to go to church, they don't have to do any of that. They have to make a commitment in their hearts on my bus.' </p> <p>And do they? I ask </p> <p>'Well,' he explains, 'the bus is not licensed yet.' </p> <p>Shouldn't salvation be a bit more tricky than getting on a bus? I wonder. </p> <p>But by now, the conversation has moved on to the relative merits of Jesus Christ Superstar against The Passion of the Christ. The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is the work of the devil apparently (and not just its melodies); the television networks which insist on broadcasting it should be shut down with immediate effect. Mel Gibson's epic, meanwhile, is the Word of God, or as close as we are ever likely to come to it. On this, there is agreement from Republicans and Democrats alike. </p> <p>At the Arrowhead Stadium, after the usual preamble about the shortfall in contributions and a plea to stump up the remaining $1.8m ('We're not leaving until we have it'), Graham launches, as promised into his apocalyptic stride. He is not going to talk politics, he says, it is not appropriate at election time. 'Still,' he suggests with a smile, 'I have my views. I think you can guess 'em.' Fifty thousand Kansans can. </p> <p>And, really, politics is what he does talk. In between anecdotes about down- home folks from Texas, he lists the world's horrors, the things all right- thinking Kansans should fear. The papers are full of crime, killing and rape. There are hurricanes in Florida; there are locusts in West Africa. In Haiti, apparently, they are 'eating each other'. All these are signs, signs that the Second Coming is upon us, that the End Times are approaching. And chief among these celestial signals 'is what is happening in the Middle East ...' </p> <p>Graham hardly needs to elaborate further, before allowing the stadium to fall silent and offer his audience their solution. 'The choice is yours,' he says. </p> <p>And right on cue, here they come again. Slowly filing down the aisles. Ready to join their fellow Americans in eternal life. </p> <p><strong>All Americans believe in God - <br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>Mostly true. 64% of Americans believe in God, 17% believe but sometimes have doubts, 4% believe only part of the time; only 15% of the population are atheists. All of the believers are convinced to a greater or lesser extent that America has a special place in God's plan, with around 25% believing that it is God's chosen country - offering as evidence the US's 'superior' democracy and fabulous wealth.</p>",
  "<p>In a community college deep in the Bronx, two smart-suited men are struggling to stick to the rules of a presidential-style debate. Fernando Mateo, a businessman and community activist who spoke at the recent Republican National Convention, is defending his President. Miguel Mart\u00ednez, a Democrat councillor in Manhattan and former teacher, is pointing out that 1.6 million jobs have been lost during this administration. The main issues are education, healthcare, employment - issues significant for all Americans, but this debate has been staged in order to focus on the specific needs of a community that both parties are courting ferociously this year as never before: Latinos. </p> <p>Mateo and Mart\u00ednez are Dominican-Americans. Despite a Yankees game going on nearby, the auditorium is filled with young brown faces, and the opponents are drowning out the miked-up moderator. 'Our children are disproportionately in bad schools!' Mart\u00ednez exclaims. 'There are 1.5 million Latinos looking for work! 13.2 million without health insurance!' Mateo counters with even less favourable figures under Clinton. </p> <p>The most oft-repeated fact of this election is that it will be won in the 'swing' or 'battleground' states. It's less commonly known that in five of those states - Florida, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada - Latino voter turnout and preference will be decisive. </p> <p>Last year, the Census Bureau announced that Hispanics were the majority minority in the United States. They are 20 per cent of New Yorkers, 40 per cent of Angelenos, and there are cities in Texas that are 80 or 90 per cent Hispanic. One in eight Americans is of Hispanic origin. More of them than ever before - about eight million - are expected to go to the polls this year, and a large number of those people are not tied to either political party. </p> <p>So far, however, their voting strength is not equal to their proportion of the population; many of them are not yet US citizens, though a legalisation programme in 1986 increased those numbers, and they will continue to rise. Perhaps more surprisingly, one third of Latinos are under 18 - they are the youngest minority in the country, which means the groundwork done by the candidates in this election will have an even greater effect in the next one. A Democrat pollster in Florida recently announced that 'the battleground voter is the Latino'. But Latinos are more than that - they are the future. </p> <p>It's striking that this vote is so genuinely up for grabs: although 60 or 70 per cent of Latinos now vote Democrat, that's nowhere near the 80 to 90 per cent the party gets from the black community. Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, vice president for policy at the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) in Washington, the largest Hispanic civil rights organisation in the US, explains: 'What we've been saying is, the first candidate that figures out how to talk to us about education and healthcare in a compelling way, from either party, can lock up this vote. What is a source of great frustration is that the political process tends to look at immigration as the number one issue affecting Latinos, and then move on.' </p> <p>Immigration is an important issue - the last census counted 28 million first-generation immigrants, the highest number in history, and a significant proportion of those are Hispanic. But in every nationwide poll among Latinos, it has not been the number one issue. Sixty per cent of Latinos are US-born citizens; many live in mixed-status families, and so are more likely to be won over by the sort of immigration reform proposed by John Kerry (offering a path to equal citizenship for 8 million undocumented workers). But their prime concerns are those of any other American - only, you might say, more so. </p> <p>'The bottom line is, we are more likely than any other Americans to lack health insurance,' Mu\u00f1oz says. 'We are twice or three times as likely to drop out of high school, we are both more likely to be working and more likely to be poor.' That disadvantage has not been addressed by either candidate - though, to be optimistic, there may be some truth in the suggestion by one Bush-Cheney campaign official that 'Latinos are better off and more empowered if both parties are fighting for them'. </p> <p>The term 'Hispanic' came into official use in 1973, when the Nixon administration formally divided Americans into five races. As a result, according to the political commentator Michael Lind, the category reflects 'political imperatives, not cultural realities'. (Now the terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino' are used interchangeably, though liberals prefer the latter, on the grounds that the Spaniards were the very people who destroyed the indigenous cultures of Latin America.) Many people call themselves Latino, but the people referred to in this way come from 22 countries of origin - how could they all be the same? </p> <p>There are Mexican-Americans (predominantly), Dominican-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and so on; first-generation, second-generation, third-generation immigrants. All have different cultures and views. As Ruben Mart\u00ednez, a writer and professor at the University of Houston, puts it: 'To say that a Cuban who fled the Castro regime in 1959, has voted Republican in every election and lives quite well-off in Miami has anything in common at all with a recent Mexican immigrant who's picking strawberries in California and lives in a trailer home, is just an utter illusion. It's a marketing term, and it's a term used by politicians at election time.' </p> <p>What is common to them all is their increased visibility - not just in numbers, but in terms of power, in all spheres. Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek and Benicio del Toro are some of the best-known actors in the world; then there are pop acts like Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin; bestselling writers including Sandra Cisneros and Fran cisco Goldman; baseball heroes like Sammy Sosa; fashion designers like Oscar de la Renta. Latino political voices are getting louder - the last US Treasurer, Rosario Marin, was Latina; Bill Richardson, a Native American-Mexican-American, is the Democrat governor of New Mexico. Latinos are excelling in business, and are more prominent in the military. Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez is the Coalition ground commander in Iraq, and 10 per cent of the soldiers fighting there are Latino. And there lies a crucial issue: whatever their origins, these people are American - and even prepared to die for it. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington published Who Are We? , an extravagantly controversial tome which claimed that this wave of Hispanic immigration was a threat to America's national identity. Spanish-speaking immigrants, he argued, consistently failed to assimilate. But demographic studies show quite the opposite, that Latinos assimilate overwhelmingly. 'You know,' says Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, 'the whole purpose of immigrants coming here is to achieve the American Dream, which is in some ways the ultimate in assimilation.' </p> <p>Douglas Knight, chairman of ImpreMedia, the largest Spanish-language newspaper publisher in the US, thinks the issue is slightly different. 'What's happening is this kind of parallel culture - in other words, it's not like it's a continuum that goes from no assimilation to complete assimilation. There's actually this middle ground of people who are completely assimilated, thank you very much, but also have a very strong Spanish language heritage. I mean, these are Americans, and they love being in America. But they speak two languages and share two cultures.' </p> <p>My name is Maria Elena Durazo, vice president at large of the Here International Union. My parents are immigrants from Mexico and our family of 10 children worked in the fields of California as migrant farmworkers until I was in high school.' </p> <p>Durazo was speaking to a committee on education and the workforce at the House of Representatives. She is one of the highest-ranking Latinas in the labour movement. Her story might have been scripted for Ken Loach: she began as one of the least empowered, and is now instrumental in obtaining power for those like her. Although the membership of her union is 70 per cent Hispanic, she was the first Latina to head a local union in southern California. Durazo has ensured that large numbers of Latino workers - and they are almost half of the new entrants to the American workforce - are informed and organised enough to vote. Behind the scenes, her work has an enormous knock-on effect on national politics. And her personal history means she is perfectly placed to understand the needs of the people she now represents. </p> <p>'I started as an organiser in the gar ment sweatshops,' she says. 'I got hired as an organiser at Local 11 [the union of hotel and restaurant employees of which she is now the president] and for four years I witnessed a union deteriorate right before my eyes. The meetings were held in English only; the office closed down at 4pm - the time most members were getting off their shifts.' Durazo earned her law degree while working at the union, and managed, among other things, to quadruple pension benefits for members. Nationally, she has created allianceswith the immigrant rights and civil rights movements, and has got civil rights leaders from the black community to say: 'this movement and ours are the same'. </p> <p>In his book Crossing Over , Ruben Mart\u00ednez followed a family of migrant workers not unlike Durazo's. The son of Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants, Mart\u00ednez felt compelled to document the lives of 'outsiders' because, as he remembers, 'up until the third grade, I was the only Latino kid. I didn't want to stand apart, I wanted desperately to fit in - I felt I was pushed into that outsider's role. And from that point on, this became the essential question of my life. </p> <p>'I consider myself an American,' he continues, 'but I am often not considered one. I've been accused of traitorist tendencies, but the fact is I was born here. For the better part of my adult life I've used the term American to describe myself, and tried to claim the real promise of what American means, and to define it in terms that do include me.' </p> <p>In the last lines of Sandra Cisneros's bestselling novel, The House on Mango Street , the narrator whose name means 'hope' leaves her Latino community armed with books and paper. 'They will not know,' the book ends, 'I have gone away to come back. For the ones left behind. For the ones who cannot out.' [sic] In a sense, Cisneros and other writers of the so-called 'Latina boom' have done just that. By mixing English and Spanish, by giving a voice to a people who had none, they have brought them into the mainstream - fetched the ones left behind. Nina Marie Mart\u00ednez, whose first novel, Caramba! , has just been published to great acclaim, might be seen as a liberated descendant of that movement. But Mart\u00ednez herself resists that kind of categorisation. </p> <p>'When I sat down to write Caramba! - and this is the biggest clich\u00e9 in the world,' she tells me, 'I wanted to write the Great American Novel, because this is what my slice of America looks like.' Mart\u00ednez was brought up by an American mother and a Mexican father, speaking no Spanish at all (she learnt it as an adult, and became 'an immigrant to my own culture'). She dropped out of high school, became a single mother at 20, and to support her child when she went back to college, started selling vintage clothes in flea markets in California. </p> <p>'We all have different dreams,' she reflects. 'I just got almost $700 for a purse I paid 50 cents for. It's like what I do for a living is a metaphor for my life. I look very vulnerable on paper - high school dropout, single mother, Latina, no real job - but I'm not. My daughter's a straight-A student, she's very mature for her age, she dresses like Audrey Hepburn. I consider myself to be very blessed that I've figured it out. You know,' she says, offering up an image that might stand for the hopes and rewards of many new Americans, 'you get the purse for 50 cents and you sell it for $700.' </p> <p><strong>Americans don't like to leave America -<br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>Yep. Fewer than 20% of Americans actually own a passport, though 70% have been to Disneyland. Reasons Americans give for not wanting to travel: 51% cite fear, 26% express no desire to go overseas, 6% say they want to see the USA first and 7% just don't like to fly. For those who would travel abroad, European destinations are the most frequently named as the preferred destination, with Britain just edging out France and Germany at the top of the list.</p>",
  "<p>Probably the last thing Iain Dowie wanted to do after this latest defeat, which sent Crystal Palace bottom of the Premiership, was to have to go home and be forced to have dinner with a Bolton supporter. </p> <p>The Eagles' manager lives only five minutes from this stadium after retaining the family home he first bought when he was in charge at Oldham Athletic and William, his youngest son, is a big Bolton fan who probably was not slow in reminding Dad that his side are now fourth. </p> <p>Bragging rights may have been firmly with William, but it is unlikely he will get carried away on the basis of an unconvincing victory over a Palace side who, for all their hard work, are decidedly mediocre. </p> <p>The experts had decided Palace were heading back from where they came even before a ball was kicked. But even Sam Allardyce has admitted that recently Bolton, without a Premiership win since the end of August, had been displaying relegation form. </p> <p>If the pre-match firework display was Allardyce's way of trying to put a rocket up his side as he approaches his fifth anniversary as Bolton manager then the plan failed dismally. They seemed devoid of ideas of how to break down a durable Palace defence, although their early rhythm was badly affected by an incident in the ninth minute. </p> <p>Ivan Campo and his captain Gary Speed were involved in a sickening clash of heads after they challenged for the same ball. It was the Spaniard who came off worst, looking groggy as he was helped off the pitch holding an ice pack to the side of his face. The fear last night was he had fractured his cheekbone. Speed had to leave the field three times to receive five stitches and to change his blood-stained shirt, but continued until the end. </p> <p>When Bolton did finally find a way through the Palace rearguard on the stroke of half-time, it owed just as much to the lack of concentration of the visitors. </p> <p>An attempt to play offside from a Bruno N'Gotty free-kick was thwarted by Wayne Routledge. He failed to move up and Kevin Davies was left unmarked to glance a neat header inside the near post. Palace protests were quickly and correctly waved away. </p> <p>The complaints continued as they left the pitch, but Palace had no one else to blame for failing to equalise four minutes after the break. Michael Hughes touched a free-kick into the path of Ben Watson, whose shot was spilled by Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen at the feet of Danny Granville. The defender smashed his shot against the crossbar from six yards. It was his side's only chance. </p> <p>Granville's miss was always likely to be costly for a side who created so few opportunities. Palace are a neat, hardworking side, but their main tactic of trying to work the ball through to Andy Johnson, their 5ft 7in talismanic striker, is one that will surely be easily stifled by most Premiership defences. </p> <p>'There's one or two things we can do better than we did today,' Dowie insisted. </p> <p>It is unlikely Master William Dowie will dared have not agreed with his dad last night. Before the match, he had been warned he would be sent to bed early if he was too cheeky.</p>",

  "<p>FIRST THERE was a high-pitched mechanical scream and then, with engines full throttle, the Sea Harrier thrust along the ramp and propelled itself up and away from the floating runway. </p> <p>HMS Invincible, the Royal Navy's flagship, is one of only three aircraft carriers in the British fleet. It is also, in today's navy, a business unit, because the real crisis facing the navy is a battle with balance sheet and mounting costs. </p> <p>HMS Invincible is a typical example. It burns \u00a327,000 of fuel every day and its missiles cost up to \u00a31 million a pop. While it provides an essential role in executing foreign policy, the pressure is on to calculate what efficiencies can be made without reducing effectiveness. </p> <p>The government has been taking a long look at defence spending, first with the strategic defence review in 1998, and then in last summer's White Paper, which announced savage cuts. </p> <p>Like any fleet heading into uncharted waters, the admiralty has been looking at new strategies, and has turned to business for the solution. Navy top brass have decided their ships need to be run like medium-sized companies, with captains managing like chief executives. </p> <p>Combat training at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth will be supplemented with courses at the London Business School, and McKinsey, the management consultancy, has been inspecting the guard along with the admiral. </p> <p>New corporate structures have been implemented, with heads of departments on each ship in charge of areas such as warfare, air engineering and logistics, all reporting to quarterly management boards. Key targets have been set, and captains are responsible for marketing, procurement and recruitment, as well as leadership and morale. </p> <p>While the current round of spending cuts make these efficiencies all very relevant, they were not the main catalyst for change. The end of the Cold War that forced the navy to re-examine itself. It needed to redefine its purpose on the geopolitical map. For years the arms race meant an emphasis on matching forces, but when that disappeared the admiralty needed to develop new goals. </p> <p>'It is mainly in uncertain times, when you are looking at your strategic future that you put in the business practices,' says Commander David Charles, one of five heads of department on Invincible. 'Then, and when there is increased cost emphasis. When defence spending was reduced, all of a sudden we had to be careful about money. As soon as you do that, you start to examine business practices. </p> <p>'I have been far more financially aware in my last three jobs than ever before. I now have control of a \u00a31.8 million budget where I have to make business cases and conduct investment appraisals for any major capital expenditure. The Treasury does not sign blank cheques any more. It wants to see where you are spending its money.' </p> <p>But while the captain of an aircraft carrier faces similar business issues to a chief executive, the differences are extreme. His workforce is stuck at the office for up to six months at a time, so morale and discipline are important management issues. He is also unable to choose his team: staff are allocated in Whitehall based on strict career progression paths and he cannot choose sailors based on qualifications or personal skills. But the most stark disparity is when things go wrong - if a captain makes a mistake, failure has much more of a downside. </p> <p>'It's life or death, effectively,' says Neil Morisetti, who has been Invincible's captain since April. 'Life or death not just in war, but in peacetime. I might be chief executive of a medium-sized company, but this is a warship. I'm chief executive, mayor, chairman of the council and the magistrate of what is a small village.' </p> <p>Since the 1700s, there have been six Invincibles. The first, L'Invincible, was a French vessel captured off Finisterre in 1747. The present one was commissioned in July 1973 from Vickers' Barrow-in-Furness yard. It has served in the Falklands, the Adriatic, Bosnia and most recently off southern Iraq, where its Sea Harriers helped enforce the no-fly zone. </p> <p>An aircraft carrier is one of the navy's most expensive assets and is kept clear of front-line combat. It is escorted by destroyers, which are more agile and have superior firepower. </p> <p>Most of a carrier's weaponry is defensive. Invincible has two 20mm cannons and off-board decoys, plus Goalkeeper, a seven-barrelled 30mm gun that fires 4,200 rounds a minute. Positioned strategically around the ship, it creates a 360-degree 'wall of lead' and is the last line of defence to block incoming missiles. </p> <p>Invincible is mainly used as a strike platform to launch attacks and co-ordinate missions from its sophisticated operations rooms. It can support visiting army units and RAF squadrons. Its only means of attack is through the aircraft on its deck. These can range from Royal Navy and RAF Harriers as well as Chinook, Merlin and Sea King helicopters. </p> <p>In navy-speak, Invincible is the designated 'high readiness carrier', which means it may be required to deploy anywhere in the world at 48 hours' notice. </p> <p>This key requirement is at the heart of Invincible's business model. Each departmental business plan is geared towards achieving this goal. It is measured by an operational performance standard, which aims to put the 48-hour notice period into a workable percentage - all of Invincible's departments have to be at 85 per cent 'readiness' for war. </p> <p>This means not only that the weapons department needs to be able to get its hands on at least 85 per cent of the ammunition to go to war within 48 hours, but also that the chefs need to be able to source at least 85 per cent of the food needed for the duration in the same time frame. This would be easy if the ship sat in port 365 days a year, but it has to source everything within 48 hours wherever it happens to be in the world. In effect, this is Invincible's 'output', its business proposition. The percentage is set and measured externally by navy officials and ultimately government. </p> <p>'We measure it quarterly,' says Chris Skidmore, Invincible's commander of logistics. 'Each quarter we have a management board meeting with the captain and heads of departments. We feed the data into a scorecard and it allows you to take a view about the capability of the ship and its readiness profile. </p> <p>'For my lot, this means I need 95 per cent of food stocks on the shelf. So when we are on exercises, where we are consuming all the time, we have to forward plan to think about where we would source things should we be required to go to war. </p> <p>'The MOD has to work out the trade-off between this [readiness] cost and the amount of time it deems appropriate for us to be able to react to a situation. Ultimately, the cost of this is competing for Treasury funds along with health and education - it is policy-driven. We don't determine the capability; we are like a car production line. Jaguar says how many cars should roll off its line; we are measured by the right number of aircraft coming off our runway.' </p> <p>Logistics is one of five main depart ments on Invincible. It deals with pay, allowances and personnel, and caters for up to 1,100 staff from four galleys. It provides stores to all the other departments. Marine engineering is responsible for the ship's equipment, ranging from the air-conditioning and electrics to the engine and fuels. Sixty officers and ratings run the air department with air traffic controllers, meteorologists and radar and communications experts. Weapons engineering and air engineering comprise 29 and 70 staff, with the former looking after armaments, and the latter the repair and support of aircraft. </p> <p>There is also a sick bay with doctor and dentist, an executive department and a secretariat. All departments report to the captain, who ultimately answers to a first Sea Lord at the Ministry of Defence. He sits alongside Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary. </p> <p>In July, Hoon announced Britain's biggest military shake-up for years. He reduced the forces to their smallest since the Second World War, with the RAF losing more than 100 frontline aircraft and the navy 15 vessels. It will now buy only eight of the new Type-45 destroyers instead of 12, and the decision to buy two new aircraft carriers is at risk. </p> <p>Hoon said the government's aim was to ensure that growth in defence spending targets what the armed forces require in the 21st century rather than what they inherited from the 20th - the logic being to put cash into smaller numbers of highly manoeuvrable ground forces, with an emphasis on high-tech air power and special operations. This is the era of remotely fought battles - known in America as 'battlefield lite' - where there will be less emphasis on expensive hardware taken into a battle zone. </p> <p>Once Hoon has announced headline figures on rationalisation, the navy top brass have to make plans using the assets left to them. Like any business with limited resources and demanding goals, much relies on the ability of the chief executive and board. Business school and management consultants are not automatically associated with the armed forces, but both are quietly forming the building blocks of its future. </p> <p>In the past two years McKinsey, the management consultant, has been developing new systems at macro and micro level. One of its ideas, which it calls 'customer organisation', has been instrumental in the current rationalisation. </p> <p>McKinsey established the government's wish list of airborne and seaborne attack strategies, then worked backwards, across the forces, to establish what assets would be needed to achieve that. 'They looked at the effect we were required to deliver and analysed how to achieve that operationally,' says Skidmore. 'Pre-McKinsey, most of the buying was service-specific. Now when we buy a new asset, the way is to think what is required to achieve a specific capability. The aircraft carrier is incidental, a tool along with assets from the army and air force needed to achieve a certain goal. These customer organisations can be applied to staffing and marketing as well as procurement.' </p> <p>Jon Green, the navy's defence publicity spokesman, says consultants can dissect problems unemotionally: 'We are using external experts to give us that wider view of business practices. When you have grown up with something you can get too close - consultants are able to think outside the box. We are also sending people on full-year and part-time MBA courses, giving us the capability to grow our own business consultants.' </p> <p>Step forward the new breed of captain - saltwater in his veins but budgets on his brain. Morisetti was sent to the London Business School, where he topped up his knowledge of resource accounting and budgets alongside business leaders. </p> <p>'I drew on my own practical experience,' he says. 'The navy is much more proactive and forward-looking as part of joined-up government. In the past there has been wastage, like in any other industry. Our shareholders, the public, want to see value for money. We take pride in offering good value. </p> <p>'If we are doing training involving an aircraft, we make sure that enough ships are involved to justify that cost. I balance the ship's speed with fuel efficiency. At 12ft to the gallon, I am very aware of my fuel allowance. But we have to avoid balance sheets deciding everything. When choosing between capital expenditure or creating a new job, you need to bear in mind that labour might have a high through-life cost, but sailors are multi-taskers. An extra mechanic will also be trained to put out a fire - which a new air-con system won't. </p> <p>'I have outputs in the same way a business does. Like a business, I have resources and people, but I don't have an ability to go to the bank and get more money. I want a motivated workforce, but the difference is that my workforce does not go home at 5pm. By virtue of this fact I have wider responsibilities. I think we have recognised a need to be forward-thinking as an employer. It is cost-effective to keep and retain staff. We have to look at the whole person and a wider support system as an employer.' </p> <p>All ships now have warrant officers who look after welfare; there is satellite television, Playstations and organised sports. Morisetti is aware of work/life balance. He will steer his ship close to shore on occasion so that sailors can pick up a mobile phone signal. His biggest challenge is satisfying the needs of diverse generations, from 18-year-olds to seamen in their mid-40s. 'We are a lean, mean business machine,' he says. 'But at the same time a caring forward-looking employer.' </p> <p>Morisetti uses a balance score card system in which different areas are flagged green, orange and red, with red indicating a serious problem. His mission is not to turn the ship green because this might be at the cost of another ship in the fleet being completely red, but to find a balance. </p> <p>One area where the navy does generate indirect revenue is as a floating ambassador to support British trade. As well as hosting cocktail parties when in port, Invincible is used as a backdrop for British business launching into new markets. </p> <p>Standing on the bridge, Morisetti considers whether he could see himself running a plc. 'We certainly develop skills in the navy that are highly transferable,' he says. 'But whether I could run a blue-chip company and deliver high profits - that I don't know.' </p> <p><strong> A financial snapshot of HMS Invincible </strong></p> <p><strong>Cost of asset </strong> \u00a31.2 billion </p> <p><strong>Cost of Sea Eagle missile </strong> \u00a31m </p> <p><strong> Staff </strong> 1,200 (with aircrew) 650 (without) </p> <p><strong> Annual salary bill </strong> \u00a39m </p> <p><strong> Daily fuel </strong> \u00a327,000 </p> <p><strong> Daily food per head </strong> \u00a32.13</p>",

  "<p>The US Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, yesterday warned that the world economy could be in trouble if oil rises much further but said current prices should not inflict the damage that previous oil spikes have. His comments came as prices touched $55 a barrel. </p> <p>\"The impact of the current surge in oil prices, though noticeable, is likely to prove less consequential to economic growth and inflation than in the 1970s,\" Mr Greenspan said in a speech in Washington.</p> <p>\"The risk of more serious negative consequences would intensify if oil prices were to move materially higher,\" he warned. The fact that the Fed chief gave a whole speech over to oil prices reflects growing concern among global economic policymakers about the 65% increase in prices so far this year.</p> <p>Yesterday US light crude futures reached a record $55 a barrel before settling at $54.90, up 2 cents from Thursday's $54.88.</p> <p>Most analysts think oil has not finished rising yet as the strongest demand for a quarter of a century has stretched world oil production to the limit.

  "<p>In 1792 Henry Walton Smith opened a small newsvendor business with his wife, Anna, in Little Grosvenor Street, London. In 1849, with the support of the local Methodist community, John Boot opened the British and American Botanic Establishment at 8 Goose Gate, Nottingham. In 1869 John James and Mary Ann Sainsbury opened a small dairy shop in Drury Lane, one of the poorest areas in London. In 1884 Michael Marks, a Russian born Polish refugee opened a stall at Kirkgate market in Leeds. What followed was an astonishing success story as these family-owned companies (now known as WH Smith, Boots, Sainsburys, and Marks &amp; Spencer) built themselves up into large corporations with iconic household names as the leaders and role models in their fields. One could add, though it has not been family owned, the National Freehold Land and Building Society, formed in 1849 and now known as Abbey National, which has been in the headlines this week for selling its troubled business to a Spanish corporation against the wishes of angry small shareholders. What these companies have in common is that they have all been in the news recently but, sadly, not on account of their proud history but because, if they are not careful, they may be consigned to history. </p> <p>As Britain changes from a nation of shopkeepers to a nation of price-conscious consumers, nostalgia no longer commands a premium. Shoppers these days will get their cheap purchases of commoditised goods - including the latest best-selling book as well as food - from the likes of Tesco and their serious books from dedicated shops like Waterstone, complete with their own coffee shops. This leaves retailers like WH Smith caught in the middle, everyone's second choice for practically everything except newspapers and magazines. </p> <p>Sainsbury, M&amp;S and Boots similarly find themselves wilting between the huge purchasing power of the giant supermarkets, the large discounts on the internet, and the premium pull of the branded merchandise. Tesco's buying power is scary enough for the traditional shops and supermarkets but that of Wal-Mart, the US multinational that owns Asda, is awesome. Goldman Sachs reported this week that in California, despite price-cutting by its rivals, Wal-Mart was over 15% cheaper for food and even more so for non-food items. This is because of the capacity of its global purchasing policies to grind down prices and costs in supplying countries. Smaller competitors simply can't match it unless they are prepared to make losses. </p> <p>In the end, the decline of the famous family shops is our fault. As consumers we prefer a one-stop shopping approach for most of our needs leaving our specialist purchases for upmarket outlets thereby creating a black hole in the middle. Such spending habits perfectly suit busy 21st century lifestyles and help produce a virtuous spiral for the giant supermarkets in which increased sales keep prices down by spreading costs across a wider base. </p> <p>The good news is that globalised competition has virtually eliminated inflation. During the most recent 12 months the price of food contracted by 0.7% and the price of clothing plummeted by almost 6%. That means we have more in our pockets to spend on other things - though in the longer term if serious deflation sets in it could threaten a recession as consumers may keep postponing their purchases - as happened in Japan - in the hope of ever lower prices later on. In these unwelcome circumstances shops such as Boots, Smiths, M&amp;S and Sainsbury may have to re-invent themselves to stay in the game as major players. They have wonderful histories but, sadly for them, history doesn't move product these days. Nostalgia has a surprisingly short shelf life.</p>",
  "<p>This occurred to me at this press conference in Ethiopia, where Bob Geldof said Poul Nielson (EU commissioner; yes, funny way to spell Paul) was talking out of his arse. (I was there, you know. Never mind why.) This sent a ripple around the room that, if you were imagining it, you'd call amusement (Pop Star Swears In Formal Environment chuckle), but in actual fact was more like delight. </p> <p>The thing is, everybody swears in normal life. All public figures of all sorts, apart from priests and Tony Benn, curse like navvies, from the coming of the dawn, when their egg is overdone, till the going down of the sun, when there isn't enough ice in their gin and tonic. I don't know that in a factual way, but I'm as sure of it as I've ever been of anything in my life. It might just be light cussing, even as mild as sod, but still, there it is, like the chug of an engine, proof that they're awake. And yet, even the least quick-witted among them, even the ones who can't remember what they were supposed to say, or what they said last week, or any answer to any simple question, can still remember to excise even the blandest profanities from their speech. They think it makes them sound respectable and adult, the cuss-free prose, but actually it just makes them sound not fully human.</p>",

  "<p>A landscape of outstanding natural beauty, of lakes, volcanoes, rainforest and pristine beaches - these are not the first things most people think of when Nicaragua is mentioned. More likely would be revolution and civil war, poverty and natural disasters. </p> <p>Nicaraguans are resigned to their homeland's mala fama . The rap is undeserved these days. It's been 14 years since peace broke out and the country is now officially the safest in the region, according to a UN survey. However, its lingering reputation has kept tourism to a trickle and prevented the best bits being bought up and over-run, as is happening in Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. </p> <p>In the way of Cambodia or Vietnam, a turbulent past gives Nicaragua an edge that is appealing to adventurous travellers. In a sense, Nicaragua is unspoilt because of it. Little by little, international travellers are discovering its charms - and the southern stretch of Pacific coastline is emerging as the country's main attraction. </p> <p>This part of the coast was our favourite escape during the nearly three years we lived in the country. Our home was in unlovely Managua. Bordered by a polluted lake, studded with volcanic formations, the capital lurks among the trees, a sprawling, low-rise labyrinth of nameless streets bathed in heat for most of the year. Like most residents lucky enough to have transport and disposable income, we escaped whenever we could. </p> <p>On free weekends and every holiday, we set out with our three young children to explore the country: the coffee growing uplands, the crumbling colonial cities, crater lakes and cloud forest covered volcanoes. But for sheer kick-back comfort, the beach was always first choice. </p> <p>It took us a while to find one we could all enjoy. In many popular places, the full power of the ocean and vicious currents makes swimming dangerous. Down in the southern corner, the coast is divided by rocky headlands into a series of curving, protected bays. The surf is still full-bodied, but the currents are tame enough. </p> <p>I'll never forget the first time we stayed at Playa Coco, standing in the warm shallows marvelling at the tropical forest on the surrounding hills while a peloton of pelicans skimmed the surf. Apart from two boys line-fishing in their underpants, we had the full three-quarter mile of golden beach all to ourselves. </p> <p>What made it perfect was that an enterprising Austrian runs a development of self-catering houses and apartments in the trees bordering the beach. The accommodation at Parque Maritimo El Coco is not especially luxurious but has flushing toilets, running water, electricity, fans and air-conditioning ... even cable TV. There's a decent restaurant, a little shop and an internet cafe, which is still a rare and extraordinary thing to find at the end of a dirt track in Nicaragua. </p> <p>Over the course of many trips to Playa Coco, we observed the pace of development picking up. Walking around the headland one time last year we found a row of large houses standing in what had been a deserted bay - they were tasteful, well-equipped and available for rent. </p> <p>On our way to our favourite beach, we'd pass through the port town of San Juan del Sur. It was growing, too. New hotels to suit a range of budgets were being built, while at the north end of the bay holiday apartments were springing up. Therealways seemed to be a new addition to the line of seafront restaurants and bars (many are owned by a growing expat colony) that shared the sunset view over San Juan's pretty bay. </p> <p>Apart from a trickle of travellers passing through on their way to or from Costa Rica, development on this part of the coast was mostly intended to satisfy local demand. There was nothing specifically aimed at attracting travellers from afar - until now. The official opening last month of a sumptuous ecological hacienda has dramatically raised the bar. Set in 1,800 hectares of private tropical forest, with a kilometre of beach all to itself, it's already luring people to a part of the world they might otherwise have ignored. </p> <p>Morgan's Rock Hacienda and Eco-lodge is owned by a French family who strayed into the hotel business by accident. It was Cl\u00e9ment Pon\u00e7on's work as an agronomist that brought the family to Nicaragua in 1974. The family settled in Managua and over the years acquired a number of rural properties. The site of Morgan's Rock was bought in 1998 as a sustainable source of tropical woods for a furniture business they were starting up with a young British architect and furniture designer called Matthew Falkiner, another long-term foreign resident. </p> <p>The original idea was to develop the property into a private nature reserve. When a subsidiary of the World Bank offered grants for feasibility research into tourism projects, the Pon\u00e7ons applied. The free study that resulted recommended the construction of a five-star modern resort hotel and the clearing of a swathe of forest to make way for a golf course. Horrified, they immediately intensified the reforestation programme, putting 30,000 new trees where the consultant planned to place the golf course. </p> <p>If the report had a value, it was in galvanising their thinking. They decided to build a hotel that was the very antithesis of the modern cookie cutter resort hotel. When we stayed, Morgan's Rock wasn't quite finished (it is now), but it was clear that they were going to succeed. </p> <p>The hotel is situated in primary tropical forest on a curving hillside at the south end of the bay. Fifteen bungalows with their own little gardens are dotted around the hillside, a short walk through the forest and over a suspension bridge from the palm thatched hacienda with its pool, restaurant, reception and bar. </p> <p> T he bungalows have their backs to the hillside and their fronts up on stilts. The main rooms are open on two sides, giving floor-to-ceiling views out through the trees to the beach and the sea. The effect is startling and soothing - you feel like you are up in the canopy. This was the idea. \"We wanted to blur the boundary between the inside and outside,\" says Falkiner, who designed everything from bungalows to lamp shades. </p> <p>The bungalows are gorgeous and original, combining modern simplicity and traditional materials: the columns are polished trunks of eucalyptus trees, the floor is made from thick boards of a lustrous dark reddish wood known as guapinol, and the walls are hand-cut chunks of volcanic rock. The furniture is all hand-made. Accustomed to normal Nicaraguan standards, we found the quality and attention to detail mind-blowing. The bungalows are large and include their own terrace deck, but are designed to have a much smaller footprint on the ground so that animals and plant life are minimally disturbed. \"Touching the ground lightly\" is the phrase Falkiner uses. It seems to work. Several times as we hung out on the deck, families of howler monkeys would stop for a while in nearby trees before moving on. </p> <p>The tropical forest that surrounds the hotel is teeming with wildlife, home to spider monkeys and white-faced capuchins, armadillos, sloths and opossums, as well as dozens of bird species: we heard (but didn't see) oropendola, with their distinctive call, and spotted several guardabarranco (blue-crested motmot). </p> <p>Since our visit, the hotel has employed a trained biologist to take guests on wildlife tours. From August to January, giant leatherback turtles come to the beach to lay their eggs. The hotel protects the nests from poachers and will wake guests during the night to witness baby turtles flap down to the sea in their hundreds. </p> <p>Morgan's Rock takes the eco part of its billing very seriously. Some 1.5m trees have been planted since the land was acquired. Waste water is cleaned in reed and gravel beds before being used for irrigation. Solar panels heat the water for the bungalows. Most of the restaurant menu (the best of local meets international favourites) is organic and own produce - vegetables, milk, chicken and meat and even farmed shrimp. The coffee comes from the Pon\u00e7on's farm in the north. The brown sugar comes from the hotel's trapiche , a traditional cane mill - the cane liquor is also worth a try. A boat goes out every day in search of wild fish and lobster. Two trained biologists run tours of the farm's local flora and fauna. </p> <p>On a guided walk to the highest point of the property, a question that had been nagging away in the back of my mind was answered: where the name Morgan's Rock came from. I suspected a little marketing licence - the famous pirate captain had plied Nicaragua's Caribbean coast and sailed up into the Rio San Juan, but never made it this far west. Admiring the view, I found out that the hotel was named after another Morgan altogether, a US senator who had championed Nicaragua as the route for the trans-oceanic canal which was eventually built in Panama. </p> <p>From the hilltop, we could see Lake Nicaragua and the twin-coned volcanic island of Ometepe that had so impressed Mark Twain in 1867, en route from San Francisco to New York by the fastest route available at the time. Morgan's canal would have ended - or begun - on the beach just down there. </p> <p>The history was lost on the kids. For them, connoisseurs of Pacific sands, the measure of Morgan's Rock would be the beach. We walked down the wooden-stepped path ready to make comparisons. The bay was perfect: good surf for boogie boarding and a special feature they loved - an estuary. With the tide in, it was possible to ride waves all the way into the calm inland waters of the river. </p> <p>When we return to Nicaragua for a holiday - we are saving up as fast as we can - there's now only one beach for us. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> American Airlines (08457 789789, <a href=\"http://www.aa.com\">aa.com</a>) fly Heathrow-Managua, via Miami for \u00a3714.30 return including taxes; Continental (01293 827460, <a href=\"http://www.continental.com\">continental.com</a>) go for \u00a3630.70.

  "<p>Driving over farm tracks to his isolated Cheshire home, Alan Garner suddenly hauls his car off the path and bumps over a field of stubble to the top of a small rise. \"It's clear enough so you can see them both,\" he says pointing to the horizon. \"There's my first book and there's my most recent.\" A domed hill in the foreground, he explains, is the western ridge of the valley of Thursbitch, the setting and title of his latest novel, which is published in paperback this month. The flatter hill apparently beyond, but actually closer, is Alderley Edge, his \"bone country\", and the predominant setting of his 1960 debut, The Weirdstone of Brisingamen. </p> <p>In fact, virtually all Garner's writing features, in one way or another, the land visible from this field. This microscopically attentive study of the region comes with a deeply-felt appreciation of its cultural history, which has won him many admirers. But it is in combining this almost claustrophobic sense of place with a prodigiously expansive handling of time that has given his work its instantly identifiable tone. </p> <p>And it is not just in Garner's work that the past, present and future meld. His home, Toad Hole, was a medieval manor house to which he has added a 500-year-old timber-framed Tudor medicine house, removed and rebuilt beam by beam from a site 20 miles away. But long before the manor house existed, this was a significant stone-age burial site - a jawbone turned up under the kitchen floor and Mesolithic flints have been found in the garden. Flattened musket rounds found also indicate an English civil war skirmish on the same site and the sense of cohabiting timescales is made complete by the startling sight of the huge white bowls of the Jodrell Bank telescope just a few yards away. </p> <p>Garner and his wife, the educationalist and critic Griselda Greaves, have been meticulous in maintaining and documenting the site. Some years ago, he was assisting in the archaeological excavation of a culvert in the garden, which found evidence in the form of organic material that would indicate a flooded, post-ice-age landscape of 7,000 or 8,000 years ago. Garner commented to one of the diggers, \"I've looked so far back in time I've got whiplash.\" It is a sensation that many of his readers will recognise. </p> <p>The critic and writer Neil Philip, in the most comprehensive study of Garner's work, A Fine Anger (1981), wrote that time was Garner's most constant theme: \"sequential, causal, 'historical' time is set against and enlarged by a 'mythological' concept of time as elastic, cyclic, recoverable\". Philip went on to note that \"myth is the crucible in which Garner's thinking about time has been fired\". </p> <p>Garner has made potent use of universal, national, and most of all, local myth and history. Francis Spufford, in his memoir of childhood reading, The Child that Books Built (2002), praises Garner's achievement in \"reintroducing myth into the bloodstream of daily life\". He saw Garner as part of an amazing generation of talent at work as the 1960s ended and in the 1970s, citing William Mayne, Peter Dickinson, Jill Paton Walsh, Joan Aiken, Diana Wynne-Jones, Rosemary Sutcliffe and Leon Garfield. </p> <p>Throughout his career Garner has been the object of almost universal critical respect and is still widely regarded as a touchstone when discussing children's literature. AS Byatt recently used him as a stick with which to beat JK Rowling. In reading writers like Garner, Byatt wrote, \"we feel we are being put back in touch with earlier parts of our culture, when supernatural and inhuman creatures - from whom we thought we learned our sense of good and evil - inhabited a world we did not feel we controlled\". </p> <p>Others have argued that it is misleading to describe Garner as a fantasy author. Professor Richard Morris, director of the Institute for Medieval Studies at the University of Leeds, is the archaeologist in charge of the Garner site. He has known Garner for 30 years, composed the music for a Garner libretto and they are working together on a book about the house. </p> <p>\"He actually creates hardly any original material,\" says Morris. \"Most of the names are real people and most of these stories have been lying around. What he does is to find things, rearrange them and put them together. His creativity lies in making connections which haven't previously been articulated. Likewise as a finder and assembler, sometimes of the simplest words, he is a genius. It is quite inappropriate to compare him to, say CS Lewis or Tolkien because he doesn't deal in fantasy, his is the real stuff of his part of England. The materials in his stories are authentic, not fabricated. Maybe this is why his later books have taken so long. He has had to prowl around to find these connections.\" </p> <p>Thursbitch, his meshing of the stories of John Turner, local packman who trafficked goods in and out of Cheshire and froze to death in the valley in 1755, and contemporary walkers Ian and Sal, was started in 1972. His previous book, Strandloper (1996), about Cheshire bricklayer William Buckley who was transported to Australia and lived as a holy man among aboriginal people for 33 years before returning home, took 12 years to complete. The closing scene, in which the returned Buckley \"dances\", bushman-style, over the topography of Cheshire, is deeply moving. \"I'm a sniper,\" says Garner. \"I will sit in the bush for as long as it takes to get that shot away. If I had to write a paragraph in 15 minutes or be hung, then I would be hung. But if anybody or anything gets in the way of the writing it's like saying to someone who is pregnant and the waters have broken that there is a good film on television. I have been fairly good at prioritising since I was a child. I think my single-mindedness is innate.\" </p> <p>Garner was born in Cheshire on October 17 1934. His 70th birthday tomorrow will be a cause of private celebration but, he says, \"I live in such a remarkable environment, both architectural and archaeological, that 70 years doesn't really figure. I just don't inhabit that type of timescale.\" He was brought up in and around the village of Alderley Edge and his early childhood was blighted by illness. Twice his parents were told that he would not survive. </p> <p>It was during a period in an isolation hospital suffering from meningitis, combined with whooping cough and measles, that Garner recalls teaching himself to read. \"I think Edgar Rice Burroughs must have had a similar experience,\" he says. \"Tarzan is described as seeing the letters on a page as little bugs and then realising that the little bugs fitted together. That was so close to my own experience. I then became a literary gourmand. I just stuffed myself with books.\" </p> <p>At infant school a teacher tried to \"cure\" his left-handedness by strapping his arm across his chest. \"It was catastrophic. Instead of becoming ambidextrous like most left-handers do, I couldn't use either hand and it caused a severe speech impediment.\" He also remembers having his mouth washed out with soap by a teacher for speaking \"broad\" in the Cheshire dialect used by his family. </p> <p>He admits to being \"an oddball\" at school and discovered he was a natural athlete who would later be an international standard junior sprinter by \"getting out of the school gates before the others. But I don't blame the other children. I wasn't there most of the time and when I did turn up I was getting twice as many marks as them. I once remember making the whole room boil when I was about eight and spent a lesson drawing a section through a volcano in multicoloured chalks. In the end my teacher would ask me only to put up my hand if I didn't know the answer.\" </p> <p>Harold Smith, who became an upholstery teacher, was a primary-school contemporary and remembers the young Garner as \"a bit precocious. There were about six or eight of us who were a little gang and he was always the ideas man behind things. He had ideas that no one else had and was quite charismatic and a bit of an exhibitionist, although as he got older he became more of a loner.\" </p> <p>Garner won a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School and says he suffered from the \"classic grammar-school syndrome that has perhaps been over-documented. It was like a portcullis coming down. A friend's mother told me I wouldn't want to speak to them any more. And while my family was initially pleased, they didn't realise that getting an education is not like getting a car. The child expands and the family cannot cope.\" </p> <p>Garner's father was a house painter from a family of local craftsmen. He describes his mother's side of the family as full of \"cranks and anomalies and sparky people. My maternal grandfather was both the original and the destructive mind. In the early 1900s he was a senior reporter on the Yorkshire Post, which was no mean feat. He ended up as a nightwatchman at the Hovis factory in Macclesfield.\" Garner, who suffers from manic depression - \"actually a psychosis and better called bi-polar disorder\" - suspects his grandfather was similarly afflicted. </p> <p>As the first member of his family to receive a formal secondary education, he says the phrase that sticks in his mind with the greatest anguish was members of the family saying \"you are only trying to make me look a fool\". \"I learned the hard way that there wasn't much point in rushing home and becoming excited about irregular verbs. But my [paternal] grandfather, who was a triple smith - blacksmith, whitesmith and locksmith - never said this. He gave me the wonderful advice, 'if the other fellow can do it, let him'. What he was saying was 'find out what is in you and don't let other people say otherwise', and that has been the single conscious driving force in my life. It haunts me and justifies me.\" </p> <p>At Manchester Grammar School - where a children's library is now named after him - Garner was an exceptional athlete, but when a national coach told him he could be the first British sprinter to reach an Olympic semi-final, he immediately gave up. \"If there were 15 other people who could do what I was doing, what was the point? It was back to my grandfather again and I was quite happy to let the other fellow do it. Although I must say it was worth being a good athlete just to get through basic training when I did national service. I was fine when it crucified most people.\" </p> <p>Garner did not write at school although a pastiche of The Waste Land - \"I thought it was a con because any poem that needs notes has not been properly worked. Perhaps I'd be a little less dismissive now, but I don't withdraw all of it\" - made it into the school magazine. He was a gifted linguist and at one time had a reading knowledge of 12 languages. \"For a time I could absorb any language like a sponge but I still don't understand why I had to learn so many. Was I unconsciously rejecting my real language?\" asks Garner, who has increasingly incorporated his local dialect into his books and says that even as a young man he never consciously despised or rebelled against his roots. \"It just so happened that every step forward was away from there.\" </p> <p>After school Garner did national service as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery before taking up a place at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read Classics. Although he was active in drama societies he still wasn't writing. \"There were lots of people saying they were going to write and they just embarrassed me.\" Former Conservative minister Kenneth, now Lord, Baker was assistant stage manager for a production of Antony and Cleopatra in which Garner played Antony, his wife to be Ann Cook was Cleopatra and Dudley Moore played Enobarbus. \"Alan was a very good actor and nice man,\" recalls Baker. \"I remember him having this personal theory about the dark lady of Shakespeare' s sonnets coming from Cheshire. He was very dogged defending it against all comers. And he wrote a diary in Egyptian hieroglyphics.\" </p> <p>In Oxford Garner once found himself in the same room as Tolkien and CS Lewis, with whom he would later be compared. \"I heard Tolkien say that modern English is not a vehicle capable of writing prose,\" he remembers. He says he arrived at Oxford \"assuming\" he was on an escalator that would lead to a chair in Greek but soon lost all enthusiasm. \"I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew it wasn't what I was doing. Then I remembered this essay about the artist as the last free spirit and, with a total lack of logic, thought as I was good at languages I could therefore write.\" A \"Damascus-road moment\" came when sitting on a tree stump at home looking at a wall built by his great-great-grandfather. \"And I knew I had to do something that was as well done as that wall. As a writer I had to be true to that wall. When I went back to Oxford it had become a cold and irrelevant place for me.\" </p> <p>Despite his determination to leave, Garner expected his tutor to persuade him to stay. \"But instead he said I was an obsessional perfectionist to the point of self-destruction and if I didn't get a double first I would destroy myself and do nothing with my life. And if I tried to get my double first and write a book I would do neither. So we had a gentleman's agreement and he said, and this is verbatim because there are some things you just don't forget, 'go down now and discover whether you have an original mind. If you find out that you have not, you may come back to this place and spend the rest of your life reading the works of those who have'.\" </p> <p>Garner left Oxford aged 22 in 1956 but returns later this month for an Alan Garner Day staged by the Bodleian Library to mark its official receipt of his papers. Richard Ovenden, Keeper of Special Col lections &amp; Western Manuscripts at the library, says: \"We probably have the greatest collection of children's literature and Alan Garner's papers are a wonderful addition.\" Ovenden praises the comprehensiveness of his papers. \"He obviously thinks in an archival way which is apt for someone so interested in how the past affects the present. And he is enormously enthusiastic about his collection being available for study. Sometimes literary figures can be more concerned about their manuscripts as valuable assets rather than research materials, but that is not the case with Alan.\" </p> <p>Garner returned to Cheshire and in September 1956 began work on what would become The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, his magical story of holidaying children Colin and Susan coming into contact with the legend of the wizard of Alderley Edge. By this time he had married his first wife, Ann Cook, whom he had met in Oxford. They had three children; Ellen, Adam and Katharine. In 1961 Garner met Griselda. They married in 1972 and have a son, Joseph, and daughter, Elizabeth, who published her first novel, Nightdancing, last year. \"Instinctively we have never discussed anything about writing and Elizabeth has still not read Thursbitch ,\" Garner says. </p> <p>Soon after returning from Oxford, Garner saw a for sale sign outside his current home, then divided into two cottages. The price of \u00a3510 was beyond his reach, but his father, who had been contributing to a penny-a-week saving scheme, unexpectedly and without much comment, loaned him the money. Such is the architectural and archaeological value of the site that the Garners have established an educational trust to take over the property after their deaths. </p> <p>Richard Morris says that \"their management of the site has been highly sensitive and almost unique in that virtually every artefact that has come from the garden, no matter how apparently trivial, has been retained. And by not modernising the house they have ensured that it is there to speak to the future. They should get some sort of recognition because it is a conservation dream and the trust is an enormously generous gesture.\" Garner says, \"It is now so valuable that it would have to be sold for death duties, and the only people who could afford it are the people I've been protecting it from all these years.\" </p> <p>Linked to the work at the house is a multi-disciplinary project led by Manchester University focusing on Alderley Edge. \"There are 20 disciplines,\" says Garner, \"but the oral archive is the jewel in the crown and I'm proud that that couldn't have got off the ground without me. That is something the other fellow just couldn't have done.\" </p> <p>The Weirdstone of Brisingamen was published in 1960 to immediate acclaim, with the local bookshop selling 500 hardback copies in the first week. The 1963 sequel, The Moon of Gomrath, was also well received. Despite his status and success, throughout his career Garner has had a reputation for tetchiness about his work being called \"children's literature\". There are picture books such The Little Red Hen (1997) - his biggest public lending rights earner - that clearly fall into this category. But when he left Oxford to write he did not anticipate producing something so attractive to younger readers as The Weirdstone of Brisingamen . \"I do not write for children,\" he once explained in an essay, \"but for myself. Adolescents read my books. By adolescence, I mean an arbitrary age somewhere between 10 and 18. This group of people is the most important of all.\" </p> <p>Neil Philip suggests that it is Garner's \"unwillingness to make any statement before he is ready to do so, before he has reduced his ideas to their simplest, their essential form,\" that makes his work appealing to this group. </p> <p>In the early 60s Garner combined writing with some part-time television presenting and in 1965 published Elidor, in which three children are drawn back into a dying world through the portal of a dilapidated Manchester house. It consolidated his commercial and critical reputation and in 1967 The Owl Service, the only non-Cheshire based novel, which drew on Welsh folk-tales of the Mabinogion, won the Carnegie Medal and Guardian children's book award. </p> <p>However, during the filming of The Owl Service for television in 1969, Garner suffered a mental collapse. \"In the process of film-making, time is fragmented and the autobiographical bits of the story, of which I am never aware at the time of writing, felt as if they had cut loose like a detached retina. Something from 1949 would be crashing into something from 1952 and then crashing into 1960. I had no temporal awareness and in the middle of a conversation with someone I'd suddenly not know who they were and become concerned that I'd be late for school unless I stopped talking.\" </p> <p>Several sessions with a psychiatrist got him back to work but there were periodic episodes over the years until, in 1980, he says, \"it was as if the lights were turned down and I lost all sense of worth\". He remembers listening to Benjamin Britten's Serenade for tenor and horn. \"I had to leave the room because I thought it would kill me. For two years I spent 12 hours a day lying on the settle in the kitchen, and the other 12 hours in bed. How my family survived I do not know. The only people who connected with me were Joseph and Elizabeth, who were infants, and they acted like animals and stroked the back of my neck. After two years it went quicker than any aspirin could shift a headache and I thought what on earth was all that about?\" </p> <p>He was, eventually, diagnosed with manic depression and prescribed lithium although he now takes no medication. \"Lithium is a pretty brutal poison and you have to get it spot on. And nearly all writers, who are vastly over-represented among sufferers, who have been treated with it, eventually refuse to take it because nothing seems to matter, whether good or ill. They seem to need the lows and the highs in order to write.\" </p> <p>Garner's 1973 novel, Red Shift, was a major departure. It took six years to write and intricately meshed three present-tense narrative threads set among Romans in Britain, the English civil war and contemporary Cheshire. The TLS called it \"probably the most difficult book ever published on a children's list\"; another reviewer claimed it was a \"bad attack of gimmicky self-indulgence brought on by over-praise\". But the book was also hailed as a masterpiece and, 20 years on, is seen as the precursor to both Strandloper and Thursbitch . </p> <p>Linda Davies was Garner's publisher at the time. \"He was already a big noise when I joined and part of my job was to keep Alan Garner on the list,\" she recalls. \"There was a big debate whether to publish Red Shift as a children's book because our salespeople didn't understand it at all, but I was stunned that a children's book could provide something so flexible and intriguing.\" </p> <p>Garner subsequently agreed to produce next a recognisable children's book but the four-volume Stone Book Quartet, published from 1976-80, was not quite what his publisher was expecting. Science fiction author Brian Aldiss called his reworking of the craft tradition in his father's family and the generational rites of passage it spawned as \"beyond all making\". Garner's prose is reduced to a deeply satisfying simplicity that nevertheless yields almost endlessly layered readings and Garner identifies the quartet as the work he has been happiest with. </p> <p>\"The thing that keeps me writing is that the next time I will get what I saw and then I can stop,\" he says. \"Good for me is having the smallest possible gap between what I could have written and what I ended up with. I've never got what I wanted but the Stone Book Quartet came very close. There are parts of Thursbitch that I don't know where they came from, but it somehow resolves parts of my own life in a way that I don't understand.\" </p> <p>Both Strandloper and Thursbitch, like Red Shift before them, have been described as \"difficult\" reads. Neil Philip says: \"The opening page of Strandloper is almost incomprehensible and you have to be willing to trust the flow of words. It seems like a deliberate attempt to shake off people who aren't willing to put in the effort. But if he could make it easier he probably would.\" Philip goes on to explain that in many ways the books work more like poetry than as novels. \"There is the greatest possible range of meaning in the fewest possible words. What Alan is really interested in is folding his language in on itself to make a collapsible universe where everything is dense with meaning.\" </p> <p>As to whether there is any overriding theme or purpose to what he writes, Garner says that, consciously, his purpose is to \"finish the book and be quit of it, because it is stimulating, exhausting, wholly demanding and relentless, and not a little frightening\". But one image he comes up with is that of a goods train, with each book a wagon. \"The theme, whatever that may turn out to be when there are no more wagons to attach, is that all are being moved in the same direction by the engine (me or what drives me), along the same track; and the whole can be seen by only the observer standing and watching from the side as it goes by. The engine can't see with accuracy, but is aware of the mass of the whole.\" </p> <p><strong> Alan Garner</strong> </p> <p><strong>Education: </strong> Alderley Edge School; 1945-52 Manchester Grammar School; '54-56 Magdalen College, Oxford. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1956 Ann Cook (one son, two daughters) divorced; '72 Griselda Greaves (one son, one daughter). </p> <p><strong> Some books: </strong> 1960 The Weirdstone of Brisingamen ; '63 The Moon of Gomrath; '65 Elidor; '67 The Owl Service; '73 Red Shift; '75 The Guizer; '76-80 The Stone Book Quartet ('77 Tom Fobble's Day, Granny Reardun; '78 The Aimer Gate; '80 The Lad of the Gad); '96 Strandloper; 2003 Thursbitch. </p> <p><strong> Libretti: </strong> 1971 The Bellybag (music by Richard Morris); '72 Potter Thompson (music by Gordon Crosse). </p> <p><strong> Edited: </strong> 1969 The Hamish Hamilton Book of Goblins; '84 Alan Garner's Book of British Fairy Tales. </p> <p><strong> Honours: </strong> OBE 2001.</p>",
  "<p>Muslims must reach out and connect with other Britons as equal citizens, and resist the impulse to withdraw into isolated communities, one of the foremost thinkers on Islam in Europe will tell his audience this evening at the European Social Forum in London. </p> <p>Tariq Ramadan urges Muslims to embrace and get to know the culture and history of the countries they live in in Europe, and develop a \"blossoming\" confidence as the inheritors of Islam, one of Europe's great faiths. </p> <p>\"The situation is bad throughout Europe, and now is the time for Muslims to reach out and create partnerships,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Muslims must stop the perception of victimisation and their obsession with their minority status - that way we are nurturing the idea that we are not really at home here, and that is reinforced by governments. </p> <p>\"There are millions of Muslims in Europe and always have been. It is a distorted history which omits the role of Islam in the construction of European consciousness.\" </p> <p>In recent years, Mr Ramadan, the author of several academic books, has been attacked from all sides for attempting to formulate a modern, moderate, confident Islam. </p> <p>He has been named as one of the 100 most influential thinkers in the world by Time magazine, but that did not stop his US visa being revoked under the Patriot Act in July, when he wanted to take up a professorship at Notre Dame University in Indiana. </p> <p>Mr Ramadan, who was born and educated in Geneva, is teaching by teleconference while the US authorities reconsider his application. </p> <p>He had been admitted to the US many times, and given a presentation to the state department on European Islam. </p> <p>He has also been barred from many Muslim countries for his advocacy of democracy and human rights. </p> <p>\"A silent revolution is coming in how Muslims think about themselves and about the universal common values they share with the west, and about democracy and modernity,\" he says. The develop-ment of a European Islam will have a \"tremendous impact on Islam throughout the world\". </p> <p>But Mr Ramadan says fear is being used as an ideological weapon: \"It gives governments a kind of political control - 'We will monitor you in order to protect you' - a new ideology when all the others are so empty.\" </p> <p>At stake, he says, is not just the wellbeing of the Muslim community, but the values and principles of western democracy: \"The way Muslim people are treated is undermining British values such as freedom of conscience, equality before the law, and anti-racism.\" </p> <p>\"We need to develop mutual knowledge, not just tolerance. The question is, what are you doing to find out about others? Respect comes out of knowledge; when you recognise my reality is as complex as yours, that's when you begin to know me andrespect me.\" </p> <p>Mr Ramadan's grandfather, Hassan al-Banna, was the founder of one of the most powerful Muslim political movements in the 20th century, the Muslim Brotherhood. But Mr Ramadan is careful to distinguish his own thinking, particularly on violence. </p> <p>\"There is an acceptable diversity within Islam, but killing innocent lives has to be condemned,\" he says. In situations such as modern-day Israel, \"the context may explain the killing, but it can never justify it\". </p> <p><strong>Highlights of the European Social Forum</strong></p> <p><strong>Today</strong> </p> <p>Debates: Muslims in Europe; disarmament; world food day; environment; third world; European citizenship </p> <p>Culture: Palestine rappers; Dark art music; Rasta international; Iraq - the opera; films on the WTO, water and Argentina </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong> </p> <p>March from Russell Square to Trafalgar Square, 1pm </p> <p>Debates: Iraq occupation; IMF and World Bank; privatisation </p> <p>Culture: Italian marching protest band; Brazilian Capoeira; Asian Dub Foundation, Peter Doherty and others</p>",
  "The concern raised by some pundits that the scale of trade union involvement in this year's European Social Forum represents a mainstream takeover will raise a wry smile from those who remember that it was only 20 years ago that Margaret Thatcher dubbed unions the \"enemy within\". <p>On the contrary, the strength of involvement in the social forum meeting this weekend in London is testimony to a new union willingness to build alliances with a range of social movements that share our values and our ambition to create a better world. The campaign to organise cleaners at Canary Wharf is one example. The cleaners - mainly women of African and South American origin - clean the desks and empty the bins of some of the richest bankers in the world for little more than \u00a35 an hour, minimum holidays and zero pensions. </p> <p>The Transport and General Workers Union has teamed up with the East London Communities Organisation to help the cleaners organise and campaign for a living wage. One key demand is that employers greet the cleaners with a \"hello\" and a smile in the early morning. This may seem minimalist, but this demand for respect - to be treated as human beings and not just (at best) as human resources - is profound, and lies at the heart of the new alliance. And that alliance is rooted in the under- standing that success will not be won by organising either in the workplace or in the community - it needs both. </p> <p>The willingness to work beyond the workplace to improve people's lives is in part a product of the new make-up of the union movement. For the first time in history, union membership among women and men has reached 50/50. Winning decent, affordable childcare provision in the community is as important to today's typical trade unionist as better pay. As the union pioneers of the 19th century realised, improving the social wage - public housing, education, pensions and health - not only provides minimum protection but acts as a crucial vehicle for that core union aim of greater equality. And building alliances with those that share our aims, from community childcare campaigns to faith-based organisations, simply makes good sense. </p> <p>Growing globalisation has demonstrated ever more vividly that going it alone is not an option. While the union movement has always been international, it has not yet proved a match for rising multinational corporate power. Joint campaigns between students, workers and consumers such as \"No Sweat, Fair Play\" and \"Labour Behind the Label\" exposing exploitation and human rights abuses have put governments and corporations in the spotlight and labour standards on the agenda. Campaigns to curb the freedom of corporations to move operations, from call centres to car factories, around the world at whim necessarily depend on international solidarity to succeed. </p> <p>Of course if unions are to help change the world, then we must also change ourselves. While manufacturing job losses have hit union numbers hard, there are new signs of growth among women workers in the private service sector, once seen as a no-go zone for unions. Increasingly, unions are recognising that reaching a new generation of workers - from young IT professionals to low-paid migrant workers - means trying out new ways to organise not just at work but in society too. </p> <p>Of the 20,000 people gathering in London, most of them will be young, many of them will be black, and a lot of them will have migrated here to look for work - the very people trade unions need to recruit and organise to win workplace justice. The scale of the event, and the groups it attracts, run counter to the prevailing orthodoxy that people (and especially the young) are uninterested in politics and that migrants just want to keep their heads down. </p> <p>But if the European Social Forum is really going to break those \"rules\", it needs to be more than a talking shop. And if union involvement in the forum is to be more than tokenism, we need to treat it as more than a glorified recruitment fair. The overwhelming concerns of those at the ESF are ones to which trade unions ought to be responding - privatisation, discrimination and deregulation. The challenge for all of us is to get better at winning. </p> <p>The ESF is an opportunity to talk about another Europe in another world. To reach that promised land, we will need another trade union movement. On Monday, when the ESF is over, unions will still be around, not just in London but in workplaces all over the world. The forum will pose the questions. Unions must become central to the answer. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Frances O'Grady is the deputy general secretary of the TUC </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:info@tuc.org.uk\">info@tuc.org.uk</a> </p> <p>The Guardian is a media partner for the European Social Forum, which runs at Alexandra Palace in London until Sunday.

  "The Israeli army last night began withdrawing from Palestinian areas of the northern Gaza strip, winding down the largest assault on the territory in recent years and leaving more than 100 Palestinians dead and widespread destruction of homes. <p>Palestinians looked on as the 200 tanks and armoured vehicles rolled north, though the Israeli government warned they would return if Hamas rocket attacks resumed. </p> <p>\"We will move in and act whenever we feel there is a threat,\" said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for Ariel Sharon, the prime minister. </p> <p>At least 20 of those killed in the 16-day Israeli operation were under 16. </p> <p>A 65-year-old woman shot in the head yesterday by an Israeli sniper was believed to be the last victim of Operation Days of Penitence, begun 16 days ago after a Hamas rocket killed two children in the Israeli town of Sderot, close to Gaza. One Israeli soldier was killed in the incursion. </p> <p>Even after the government announced the operation was ending, troops moved into the town of Beit Hanoun and ordered people from their homes, apparently for fresh demolitions. </p> <p>About 200 tanks and hundreds of troops began to pull back from Jabaliya refugee camp, Beit Lehia and other residential areas after dusk. Sources in the prime minister's office indicated there might be a total withdrawal, but some forces remained. </p> <p>The government ended the operation under pressure from the military, which believed it had fulfilled its aim of clearing areas to prevent rocket attacks, and that tanks and troops in Palestinian urban areas were vulnerable. </p> <p>While Days of Penitence reduced the number of rocket attacks, it did not end them; Hamas continued to fire missiles at Sderot on most days. </p> <p>But the military did kill dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, including several commanders in missile attacks on cars, motorbikes, and a donkey cart. </p> <p>The operation's principal effect seems to have been to punish hundreds of thousands of Gaza's residents for the attacks, through the widespread destruction of homes and buildings, severe constraints on movement, including cutting off southern Gaza from the north for 10 days, and the sheer terror created by the widespread killings. </p> <p>Israeli snipers shot dead several children in their homes including two 15-year-old girls from the same school. </p> <p>A 13-year-old girl was also riddled with bullets close to a military observation post near the Rafah refugee camp. </p> <p>An officer accused of emptying his automatic rifle magazine into the girl was cleared yesterday of unethical behaviour, but suspended anyway on account of poor relations with his subordinates. </p> <p>Many of his platoon accused him of the deed. </p> <p>Military officials said the withdrawal was approved \"to ease the burden on the Palestinian civilian population\" during the holy month of Ramadan which began yesterday.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0131-557 6727<br><strong>Address:</strong> The Balmoral, 1 Princes Street, Edinburgh.</p> <p> I wouldn't say I'm obsessed with cheese, but while holidaying earlier this year in Antibes, I made a 500km round trip to the Proven\u00e7al village of Puimichel, just to buy a rare pot of the local fromage fort. It's called Cachaille, is made by grating dry cheese into an earthenware pot, then adding eau-de-vie, pepper, olive oil and fresh cheese, and can be kept for up to 20 years, if periodically topped up with new cheese. (Unsurprisingly, it stinks like a rotting cadaver, but then what is cheese if not the corpse of milk?) </p> <p>The cheeses wheeled to my table at the end of this review (on something resembling a mortuary trolley for midgets) were almost as powerful, including a Pouligny Saint-Pierre in its feculent prime. You can count the appearances on British cheeseboards of this \"Eiffel tower\" (so-called because of its pyramid shape) on the fingers of a twice-convicted Saudi shoplifter. But now, let's begin this review at the beginning and, as with watching Pulp Fiction, all will become clear by the end. Though probably with less bloodshed. </p> <p>I was heading for Number One (situated within Edinburgh's Balmoral hotel) and things weren't going well. Where was I going to park? I phoned ahead and was told \"There's plenty of space at Andrew's Square\" which was true, but it's all for one hour only, so I was forced to queue for the NCP behind John Lewis, then leg it down to Princes Street (not a pretty sight). </p> <p>Things got worse when I descended into the basement restaurant, because I was suddenly surrounded by klaxon-voiced Americans shouting into their mobile phones while eating (I have a garbage disposal unit that eats better than 30% of the people in this world), and when I told the waiter \"I'm not drinking wine\", he immediately brought me the wine list. Was the award-winning Number One going to be a load of number twos? </p> <p>Fortunately, things began improving from that moment on. I was last here in the late 1990s and, looking around, I could see that the deep-red lacquered-box-style rooms had recently been tarted up with golden stripes, the spacious airy feel of this subterranean space being further enhanced by the presence of huge muscular chairs, which afforded an expansive comfort of North American proportions. Better still, half the restaurant was closed off, so lunch promised to be an agreeably intimate affair. </p> <p>Who gets excited by soup? Well, we did. The love of my life had the \"anaemic rhubarb\" soup (or \"celery\", if you prefer the wording on the menu) and thought the Stilton beignets worked well as an accompaniment (I tasted and concurred). My cream of onion soup with ham hough and truffle oil was equally sublime, with the meat encased within a single raviolo and floating on a pea-green coloured broth, surrounded by shreds of onion, and perhaps celeriac, too (I never ask - it seems petty). The chef may be Bland (Jeff Bland), but his cooking is far from it. </p> <p>Poor chefies - they just can't bloody win, can they? The soups were so perfect that they almost overshadowed the more elaborate main courses. The sage and orange crusted monkfish risotto cake and chive beurre blanc was a little too fancy for its own good, having been constructed in the fashionable Tower of Babel style. (Can't we dispense with this high-rise Japanese architectural approach, and go back to the single-storey food of yesteryear? Did Ronan Point teach us nothing?) </p> <p>Still, the result was more impressive to the palate than to the eye, especially as I'd reversed my earlier decision about the wine, and washed it down with a glass of Clifford Bay New Zealand Riesling (limey and spicy, and therefore ideal for spicy limeys). Madame, meanwhile, had vegetarian roast globe artichokes with lemon tagliatelle, ratatouille, and asparagus with tomato jus, which was a light lunch for her, but an irresistible feed-line for me. Well, the artichokes were accompanied by a quartet of sage potato quenelles, thus allowing me to exclaim loudly, \"Four quenelles!\" without the risk of being ejected from the restaurant. Childish, I know, but it fulfilled a lifetime's ambition, and shut up the mobile phone users, too. </p> <p>Her white chocolate and raspberry souffl\u00e9 with raspberry ripple ice cream arrived, and soon she was lost in reverie. I, meanwhile, was lost in admiration for the ripe-to-perfection cheeseboard mentioned earlier (I said we'd get there) and for a glass of Quinta do Noval 10-year-old tawny port that was light enough to lift the cheese without drowning it. </p> <p>The spectacular cuisine was matched throughout by the attentive staff, and I noted with approval that the restaurant has not only wheelchair access, but wheelchair access to the WC, too. Many restaurants don't have the latter, which seems a terribly cruel trick to play on the physically infirm, who can ingest as much food and drink as they like, but are not allowed to expel any of it afterwards.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Open:</strong> Lunch: 12 noon-2pm, Monday-Friday. Dinner: 7-10pm, Sunday-Thursday; 7-10.30pm, Friday-Saturday. <br><strong>Menus:</strong> Lunch: two courses \u00a316.50; three courses \u00a319.50. Dinner (chef's tasting menu): \u00a355 or \u00a385 with wine. My lunch for two: \u00a363.35 with wine. <br>Wheelchair access and WC</p>",
  "<p>I'm not really a vitamins and supplements person but I'm a big fan of alternative treatments. I'm always trying new ones like reiki and reflexology. I travel a lot, so I have plenty of deep massages to detoxify and rehydrate my body. I don't drink alcohol any more and I feel pretty calm most of the time these days. I get stressed out when work means I have to be away from my children for a long time, so I try to be away for no longer than 10 days at any one time. I read a lot. I'm reading The Power Of Now at the moment and it's really interesting. I'm a very outdoorsy person and I relax by spending time with my kids, or swimming, horse-riding, or walking. My biggest chill-out time would have to be when I'm on holiday. I recently went to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico and it was fantastic.</p>",
  "<p>There is a typically disturbing scene in Jonathan Coe's latest novel, The Closed Circle, in which our tremulously would-be adulterous husband-figure is ironing his shirt in front of the television while a cookery show is in full spate. He sees \"an implausibly glamorous young woman, living in an implausibly elegant house, preparing delicious morsels of food while tossing her hair, pouting seductively at the camera and licking traces of butter and sauce off her fingers in a manner so explicitly suggestive of oral sex that he found himself getting an erection while ironing his cuffs for the fifth time.\" Coe does not sully his prose with unnecessary information and his purveyor of gastro-eroticism is not named. We know who it is, though. More to the point, she knows. Let us not quibble. </p> <p>\"Have you seen this?\" I chirp, handing my helpfully marked-up copy to Nigella Lawson. She has not. She reads it through with the concentrated gravity of one who began her working life as a serious literary critic, closes the book and sets it down with a barely audible sigh. No comment. Later, by way of an acknowledgment, she says, \"I am not young.\" So far as she is concerned that is a matter of fact; 44 is not young. As for the rest of it, she cannot possibly be responsible for what goes on in the eyes, hearts, minds and groins of her beholders. There is nothing she can do about it but softly sigh and smile a brave and odontologically perfect smile. </p> <p>So it's not her fault. At first acquaintance, there is something withdrawn and apologetic about her, an inner privacy shared by a microscopic minority of women who, through no design of their own, happen to be physically devastatingly beautiful and are thereby fated to go through every minute of their lives batting back the presumptions made about them by the aesthetic and the envious. I dare say I gawped a bit: the dark brown eyes, the tumbling chestnut hair, the glowing skin, the generous mouth, the high cleavage across which she nervously tugs a skimpy cardie, the hourglass figure. I was hoping it would all be less daunting if perhaps the copious hair might screen some imperfection when she did the decent thing and showed me the contents of her handbag. Now there's a proper disgrace. Not only is it a slutty mess of used tissues, tinchy purselets and Biros and lippies and bits of biscuit, but there are cigarettes, loose, scruffy fags, all stained and bent and mungy in there. \"Look at that,\" she says, fishing one out and trying to straighten it up. \"Isn't it disgusting?\" And she helps herself to one of my nice clean ones which, in an absurd way, makes me feel less of an ugly sister. </p> <p>Personal identity can be a swine. What must it have been like, I wonder, to have grown up bearing, for instance, her dad's name with an a thrown in? Imagine if I'd had to struggle through school being Alberta Vincent, with everyone knowing who he was, without the a. It wasn't that bad, she says, because her dad didn't go into politics until she was 14 and he wasn't chancellor of the exchequer until five years after that. Then again, it was her maternal grandmother's idea because she loved gardening and nigella is really love-in-a-mist, that rather weedy, wispy stuff that grows wild in hedgerows, plus they did it to her sisters, too. Gave them men's names with a on the end - Thomasina and Horatia - not so much in thwart for boy-children as out of a strange, bohemian affectation of her mother's, who got their names from the Times' death columns to place herself in the vanguard of the 1960s vogue for preposterous first names. </p> <p>\"I always wanted to be called Caroline,\" Lawson says. \"Carolines were always very nice in books.\" She used to make up names for herself. \"Mercedes Wainwright was the best one,\" she says, tasting it on her tongue and approving its flavour. \"The rather pedestrian surname with the exotic first name. It feels, um, yes, correct.\" She still feels that childish diffidence about saying her whole name out loud, still feels trapped by it, still feels she has to prove it doesn't mean what people think it means. \"But maybe it put mettle in my spine,\" she says because, when the time came, she resisted the urge to use her initials as a byline and defied the demons, real and imaginary. \"Because it's my name, and I own it.\" </p> <p>And she would have gone on in this vein because, as she often remarks, she never knows when to stop. Particularly on the radio. Years ago, she was a regular contributor to those chatty shows called Stop The Week and Start The Week, and she'd find herself in the middle of what promised to be a 53-clause sentence and suddenly realise she hadn't the faintest idea what she was talking about or how this blathering could ever possibly come to an end, and the whole thing was made worse by knowing her sister was listening in at home, going, \"Stop, stop, please stop now.\" But she doesn't stop. And next time she won't, either. In fact, she courts these exquisite moments of panic as though she is literally addicted to fear. \"I am fearful,\" she says, \"so I do something. It's not that I'm a workaholic, it's rather that I like to tread the precarious line between boredom and fear. I need to be frightened of things. I hate it, but I must need it, because it's what I do.\" </p> <p>She has, for instance, a fear of cameras. \"This,\" she says, \"is something to do with a fear of disappointment that the image will not correspond with your idea of yourself.\" So now she is accustomed to vamping in front of cameras, dressing up in kitsch costumes, thinking to herself, hey, it's not my fault my cleavage starts under my nose, and just getting on with it. Twenty years ago, she would have disapproved of herself, but now she thinks, well, make the most of it, it won't last much longer. Yet behind the bravado, her secret self remains unseen; that's the joke. </p> <p>\"There is something wrong about being photographed that has nothing to do with vanity,\" she says. \"It's like being asked to understand how other people see you, and that is something you don't ever want to know. I can understand why those primitive desert people think a camera steals their soul. It is unnatural to see yourself from the outside. Better not to know.\" </p> <p>So she has learned to talk into a camera because she has decided it is only like talking to a sister or a friend, but when it comes to pretending the wretched thing isn't there, talking to someone else in front of it, no chance. She doesn't watch herself, never looks in a mirror unless she is actually applying mascara and, furthermore, when other people see her through a lens, she thinks it is as though she has turned into someone else. \"And that,\" she says with somewhat occult emphasis, \"is strange.\" When she has been parodied, called coquettish or cynical because she seems to be selling sex appeal along with the fairy cakes, she is astonished. \"I suppose I am naive,\" she says. \"I play into the hands of my detractors.\" </p> <p>When recently she obediently put on a peepshow of a dress and a pair of footbinder's fetish shoes, she was quite amused by her transformation. She camped it up like a jolly good sport for a photoshoot while \"babbling inanely\" to a reporter about how her lovely, adoring new husband thinks she's sexier than Marilyn Monroe. She did not foresee the mortifying aftermath when various tabloids, Chinese-whispering the trivia of the hour, came up with the assertion that Lawson thought she was sexier than Monroe and bomb-shock-horrored her all over their front pages. </p> <p>It was no fun walking her children to school that morning. \"I don't know why they do that,\" she says, \"but I think it's malevolent ... They set you up, make the image that they want and then blame you for it. I'll never do it again. From now on I must take full responsibility for what I agree to do.\" </p> <p>She was not unaware of the disapprobation of the chattering classes when last year she married the multimillionaire art collector and advertising tycoon Charles Saatchi in what seemed to them to be indecent haste, some two and a half years after the premature death of her valiant husband John Diamond. Tut-tuts reverberated from Pimlico to Hampstead via the swankier uplands of Islington. She didn't waste much time then. How long had that been going on? Did she even wait for the final curtain? Should we talk about any of this, I wonder, or is it too hideously intrusive for our blood? \"Of course we can,\" Lawson says, crisp as cos. \"It is in my head all the time, whether we speak of it or not.\" </p> <p>The fact is poignantly obvious. Had it not been her but some other widow, she would have gone with the flow of disapproval - indeed, she often has. \"I know I am guilty of that,\" she says. \"There is a vast difference between how things seem from the outside and how they feel on the inside. I have thought badly of other people, observing the dying and the death and then the treachery of the remarriage, quick as a knee-jerk. But I keep my own account to myself in the sense that if John's parents and my children were OK about everything, and I was, then that's it. It sounds like something on a very trite T-shirt, but life is what happens. And, yes, sometimes I think that it would have been better to have waited, for it to have happened later, but I didn't and it didn't, and I went along with it. I think maybe when you live with someone who is really very ill for a long time, it somehow gives you more of a greedy appetite for life and maybe, yes, you are less measured in your behaviour than you would otherwise be.\" </p> <p>Lawson has had more than her fair share of bereavement, watched too many people die dreadful and untimely deaths. Her mother when she was barely four years older than Lawson is now, her sister, two years her junior, then her husband, whose exquisite record of the long, slow dying of his light made us all feel as intricately involved as Lawson in his loss. Fools that we are. What to us came as an enlightenment, to her was the gradual diminution of a shared life while she watched his expression of himself removed with his throat and his tongue until it was reduced to the written word, his most intimate self shared with a computer. You'd think, she says with a practised stab at irony, she'd have been used to it by now. Or at least ready for it, when the end came. But she wasn't. </p> <p>She remembers something the theatre critic Jack Tinker wrote when his daughter died at the age of 23. He said that you only get over a death if you think of it as a life completed rather than a life interrupted. But the words are hardly out of her mouth before she repudiates them. \"What is this thing about getting over it? You don't get over it!\" She remembers back 20 years, when her mother died, how well-meaning people would ask how she was coping and, by way of empathetic consolation, tell her how well they remembered the sad death of their puppy. \"The mourning process,\" she says grimly, \"is not a matter of universal understanding.\" We cross the road when the widow walks by because we do not know what to say. We are embarrassed by her grief. We say, \"Oh, she has taken it well\" with admiration, meaning you can hardly tell she's just suffered a bit of a setback. We use these ridiculous expressions - \"Draw a line under it.\" \"Go on with your life.\" \"Put it all behind you.\" </p> <p>Lawson's first child was born 10 days after the death of her sister. The well-intentioned seized the opportunity to assure her of the good fortune of this \"compensation\". \"But you can't think, well, my sister's dead but, hey, this will make it better,\" she says. \"And when people said, at New Year, here's hoping you have a better year, you think, why, is she coming back? </p> <p>\"There is a kind of euphoria of grief, a degree of madness,\" she says. \"You are very distanced from other people because what is going on in your head is literally unshareable and you can't focus properly on what is going on outside you. And, in a funny way, each death is different and you mourn each death differently and each death brings back the death you mourned earlier and you get into a bit of a pile-up.\" </p> <p>There is a process to grief, but it is not linear. \"You don't feel this on a Monday, that on a Tuesday, as though you are making steady progress from A to B while all about you are being supportive. It's as if people think you are either happy or unhappy, one or the other. As though happiness is like some kind of domestic cleaning product you spray around to get rid of those nasty, dark, dusty corners. I don't think happiness is a remedy for unhappiness, like there, that was unhappy, now this is happy! What kind of a life is it if you don't have both? You don't go around grieving all the time, but the grief is still there and always will be. That John was so ill for so long is a cause of grief for as long as I remember it, and I have no wish to forget. I have room in my head. It's all right. I don't want to put my mind in order as I might with work or a store cupboard, because that wouldn't be a fair representation of the way things are. It is difficult to explain this to people. Language is more articulate than emotion, but it doesn't do the job. Emotion is messy, contradictory ... and true.\" </p> <p>There was a moment, not long ago, when the authenticity of this concept bore in on her with such stark clarity that the memory of it makes her laugh out loud. Her five-year-old son was watching her unpack some groceries in the kitchen. He said to her, \"You know, I'm so sad that daddy has died\" and in the same breath - \"Oooh, Twiglets!!!\" </p> <p>\"Do that as an adult and you'd be regarded as sick. But it isn't. It is just entirely honest.\" </p> <p>The parameters of Lawson's honesty are manifestly broader than those of your average domestic goddess. Her most productive and most successful years were simultaneously her saddest, while the enormity of Diamond's illness manifested itself and she comforted herself, and everybody else, with the joyful anticipation of the next mouthful. Bake a cake! she cried. Ice it! Put a cherry on top! You can do it, it's the easiest thing in the world! Failsafe! There is no other feat of kitchen alchemy that achieves more praise and pleasure in exchange for the outlay of less time and effort than the simple baking of a cake! Why knock yourself out when you can float about effortlessly in a cinnamon-scented kitchen and be the heroine of the hour? Her enthusiasm and her ability to convey it in her books and in front of the camera made her a household name and prompted much consternation among the liberated sisterhood. </p> <p>In these days of television foodery, it is interesting to observe that we are instructed in our food preparation by bad-tempered men or well-scrubbed women who have in common a tendency to be didactic and exacting, as though they're going to set a test at the end to see if you were listening. Then along comes Lawson, who gets it all down herself and lets her hair trail in the soup. More singularly, she seems to be enjoying herself. \"Is there some kind of compulsion or repulsion about flesh?\" she wonders. \"Are people so puritanical that they think pleasure from food is alarming?\" She can easily understand the feminist carping that came her way, even if it was based on the somewhat simplistic principle that since poor women have been obliged to tackle domestic labour whether they like it or not, we must all down tools, forswear, despise and revolt against it. The baby goes out with the bath water. All the female virtues of nourishing others, taking care of, making things comforting and nice, all consigned to the plughole. So far as she is concerned, you can cook or not cook, please yourself, because one is certainly not morally better than the other. Nor is there anything romantic in the spectre of sweet, caring, nurturing womanhood. Quite the reverse. </p> <p>As a child, she hated eating. Mealtimes were torture. You sat and ate what you were given, and if you didn't you were made to sit there until you did or have it served up congealed for the next meal. Children are not willing consumers. She is sure that at least part of her motivation for becoming a cook was to recover the autonomy she lost to those tyrannous teatimes. Communal eating can be a very stressful enterprise. People get tense when they entertain, and family meals can be exhausting when you're the one who has to say don't grab and don't eat with your fingers. She hears herself at home, telling them all that if she wanted to be the authority figure, she'd have joined the police force. </p> <p>\"Cooking,\" she says, \"is actually quite aggressive and controlling and sometimes, yes, there is an element of force-feeding going on. So I like to cook, I like to have people round my table, eating my food, and sometimes I feel it come over me. I find I'm staring at their plates, checking what they're eating and not eating, and then I can't help myself and this hectoring tone comes out, 'Oh, are you not having any of the chard?' or, 'Is something wrong with the crepe?' I wish I wouldn't do that.\" </p> <p>While we speak, a copy of her latest oeuvre lies between us, a glowing, tantalising volume rejoicing in its one-word promise, \"Feast\". On the back cover is a photograph of Lawson, smiling wide-eyed and welcoming into the camera, with her arms around seven large and golden baguettes. The picture says harvest, land of plenty, come in, be my guest. It is also faintly worrying, and I don't know why. Two of the loaves encroach upon her face, the finger and thumb of her left hand are daintily pinching the bottom of one of them. What is wrong with this picture? \"Oh God,\" she says. \"I know. Charles took one look at it and said, 'Phallic!'\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1327897,00.html\">Read recipes from Feast here</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Feast: Food That Celebrates Life, by Nigella Lawson, is published this month by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a325.
