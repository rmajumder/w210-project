  "The South African government is denying thousands of Zimbabwean refugees their right to political asylum, says a report published today by Refugees International. <p>\"Genuine refugees are prevented from getting asylum,\" said Andrea Lari, a researcher for the organisation. \"In many cases, Zimbabweans cannot even get into the appropriate office to apply for asylum. These people are being denied their rights.\" </p> <p>Mr Lari said up to 50,000 Zimbabweans were eligible for asylum. \"Of the 5,000 applications filed by Zimbabweans to date, fewer than 20 have actually received political asylum in South Africa,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Even more troubling is the fact that few Zimbabweans are able even to apply for political asylum.\" </p> <p>More than 2 million Zimbabweans are currently sheltering in South Africa - about 15% of their country's population of 13 million. </p> <p>Although Zimbabweans have sought work in South Africa for decades, the numbers have swollen greatly in recent years since the economic collapse presided over by President Robert Mugabe. </p> <p>Most of those in South Africa are economic migrants, without claims to refugee status. But thousands have fled because they are victims of state violence and torture and they fear more persecution. </p> <p>South Africa is obliged by law to grant political asylum to those who have a reasonable fear of such violence. </p> <p>But Refugees International says South African officials are preventing Zimbabweans from gaining their rightful status. </p> <p>Several Zimbabwean refugees told the Guardian that they were often chased away from refugee reception centres by guards with whips. \"The guards say, 'We don't want to see you Zimbabweans here. Go away!' They whip us and beat us until we run away,\" said one man, who said he had been tortured in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Refugees International is also critical of the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) for \"failing to advocate for Zimbabweans' right to protection\". It adds: \"UNHCR staff in South Africa downplay the political crisis in Zimbabwe and show a marked tendency to dismiss the legitimacy of Zimbabweans' overall case for asylum, making a minimal effort to provide direct protection.\" </p> <p>A regional UNHCR official said: \"We know there is work to be done to make sure all Zimbabweans can access the refugee procedure. That is true for people of other nationalities seeking asylum here, too.\" </p> <p>A senior South African immigration official admitted there were problems in the way the government dealt with the flood of Zimbabwean refugees. But steps were being taken to improve the situation. \"We agreed with the UNHCR to catch up with the backlog of cases of Zimbabweans seeking asylum,\" said Barry Gilder, director general of South Africa's department of home affairs. </p> <p>\"We are taking steps to counter corruption, and we have just agreed to set up new refugee reception centres, including one in Musina, near the border with Zimbabwe.\"</p>",
  "Israel's agriculture minister, Israel Katz, has announced plans for further expansion of Jewish settlements in the Jordan valley by expropriating 8,000 acres of land. <p>Mr Katz's proposal, which he said would be implemented \"without unnecessary delays\", follows revelations that the government plans to build homes for thousands more settlers on the West Bank, further entrenching its control even while it pulls out of the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Israeli tanks and troops, backed by helicopters, entered parts of the Gaza Strip yesterday in what the army said was an operation to root out Palestinian fighters who fire rudimentary rockets into Israel. At least two people were wounded in the incursion, including a 12-year-old boy, who was shot by a soldier. </p> <p>In a separate incident yesterday, Israeli gunfire hit a 10-year-old child in a UN-administered school in Khan Yunis. Raghda Adnan al-Assar underwent major surgery at the European hospital in Gaza. </p> <p>The head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Peter Hansen, accused the Israeli army of endangering the lives of children. \"The kind of live firing into refugee camps that is so indiscriminate that it makes classrooms dangerous for 10-year-old children is totally unacceptable,\" he said. </p> <p>The prime minister's office yesterday revealed that the cabinet is shortly to consider a new route for parts of the \"security barrier\" following the Israeli high court ruling that it unnecessarily harms Palestinians. The new route is expected to run closer to the 1967 border, the green line, but still to cause hardship to Palestinians.</p>",
  "<p>Daniel McNaughton's life is one long howl of agony. Growing up in Victorian Glasgow, he becomes a skilled craftsman, but his father will not make him a partner because he is illegitimate. (Who's the bastard here?) He sets up his own business, only to be - or imagine himself to be - snubbed for his origins. More from despair than conviction, he becomes interested in socialism. Soon he believes it is not just Glasgow society that is against him, but the whole world. He is being followed; his landlady is poisoning him. He tells his father, his MP, the Lord High Provost; no one takes him seriously. \"Oh God!\" he realises. \"They all think I'm off my chump.\" </p> <p>And so, one night, he finds himself in Downing Street, shooting dead the prime minister's secretary. He's arrested and tried at the Old Bailey.

  "On a rare sunny Saturday afternoon, members of the Northern Naturalists' Union gathered at the ice-cream kiosk, armed with nets, notebooks and containers, for the 257th field meeting in the union's 80-year history. The plan was to follow the falling tide over the rocks, looking for marine life that lurks around the low water mark. Soon containers were filled with brittle stars and thumbnail-sized broad-clawed porcelain crabs from the underside of rocks, shannies and butterfish from rock pools, along with more menacing captures. Velvet swimming crabs, with angry, ruby eyes, circled in the bottom of a bucket, claws akimbo, like wrestlers in the ring. Catching this irascible crustacean demands care. It's safe to pick up edible and shore crabs by gripping them across the carapace, behind the claws, but velvet swimming crabs' legs are better articulated. They reach back, nip their captor hard and take a long time to let go. <p>Terry Coult, picking his way over the weed-covered rocks at the water's edge, caught one of the meeting's star finds - a worm pipefish. Imagine a tapered black bootlace, about five inches long, with the snout of a seahorse and a single vibrating fin halfway along its back. That's a worm pipefish. It's an uncommon species in the North Sea, although divers have reported an influx of pipefish lately - perhaps a symptom of climate change. </p> <p>Soon the tide turned. Time to release our captives and retreat. For a moment the pipefish hovered in the rock pool, bewildered by freedom. An incoming wave rippled the water surface, and when it calmed this slender visitor had vanished among the swaying wracks.</p>",
  "Robert Kilroy-Silk, the Labour MP turned daytime TV presenter turned Ukip MEP, today declared he would seek a return to Westminster by standing for the anti-EU party at the next general election. <p>No seat has yet been picked for the biggest star of the newly resurgent UK Independence party, which saw 12 MEPs elected at June's European polls.</p> <p>After mounting press speculation, and allegations of an internal bid to stop him, Mr Kilroy-Silk decided not to fight this month's Hartlepool byelection, although Ukip is contesting the seat.</p> <p>But at a lunch for Westminster journalists, he said he had his eye on a constituency within his East Midlands European constituency, although it might not be the most winnable scientifically, and had been offered money from a variety of backers.</p> <p>The former TV host said he had been pledged \"as much as I need\" by various sources to fight seats up and down the country on a platform not just geared to his party's policy of withdrawal from the EU. </p> <p>\"That money is in place and it's open ended,\" he declared. </p> <p>Immigration, asylum, defence, homeland security, health and a host of other issues would all be campaign areas, said Mr Kilroy Silk. </p> <p>But speaking at a Westminster lunch he declined to say which seat he would fight at the next election or how many marginals his party would contest. </p> <p>\"We are going to change the face of British politics forever, and I promise you we will not let the British people down,\" he told reporters.</p>",
  "The lengthy referendum campaign for the EU constitution began in earnest today, as the government published a white paper setting out the case for approving the new treaty. <p>With a referendum likely to be at least a year away, the prime minister has written the foreword to the document insisting that this is \"clearly not a treaty which reduces our powers as a nation\".</p> <p>The no campaign has already got under way, backed by both the Conservatives and the UK Independence party (Ukip), with polls suggesting that the government has a mountain to climb before a yes vote can be guaranteed.</p> <p>Mr Blair hailed the controversial treaty as good for both Britain and Europe, and said he had \"no hesitation\" in recommending acceptance in the poll, expected after the next general election. </p> <p>\"I have no hesitation in commending it to the country as a success and as a major step forward in creating the kind of Europe that the British people want: a flexible Europe in which Britain remains a strong and influential power; a wider, peaceful and free Europe to which we can be proud to belong; and an effective Europe which benefits all our lives,\" he wrote. </p> <p>Publication of the white paper came ahead of a set-piece debate in the House of Commons later today in which the Conservatives will restate their opposition to the constitution. </p> <p>Mr Blair said that the enlargement of Europe to include 10 new members from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean earlier this year made it a \"sensible moment\" to redraft the complicated set of treaties and agreements governing the union's operations as a single, understandable and up-to-date document.</p> <p>He added: \"The treaty ... makes it plain that the EU is not and will not be a federal superstate. Rather, it establishes clearly where the EU can and cannot act and confirms that the EU is a union of nation states, which has only the powers given to it by these states.\" </p> <p>Suggestions that the constitution would mean Britain losing its seat on the UN security council, forfeiting control of its oil or its army or being forced to join the euro were \"myths\", said the PM.</p> <p>Britain would retain its veto on \"the most important decisions\", including issues of tax, social security, foreign and defence policy and the UK's annual rebate, as well as its opt-out on measures affecting asylum and immigration. </p> <p>In today's white paper, Mr Straw wrote that Britain had achieved \"all its key negotiating objectives\" in the inter-governmental conference which produced the treaty text. Meanwhile the Conservatives yesterday launched a new offensive against the treaty, saying they were determined to secure a majority No vote in the referendum. </p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, today said: \"I had hoped that with this white paper, we would see the start of an honest and open debate, instead this document is simply an extended piece of New Labour spin, full of claims that do not stack up. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair won't even admit that he used to be against an EU constitution in the first place. The fact is that the constitution will take huge powers away from Britain and give them to Brussels. It forms the basis of a federal European state. </p> <p>\"If we want to keep our own employment laws, our own asylum policy, and our own criminal justice system, we should throw this constitution out.\" </p> <p>Echoing the Ukip position, he said the treaty was \"a gateway to a country called Europe\". Yesterday, at a Westminster press conference, he added that his party might challenge its publication with the Electoral Commission, which has drawn up rules on how the referendum campaign should be fought, if it believed those guidelines had been breached. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Vote No campaign said: \"Straw is losing his grip on reality if he thinks that people will vote yes to this constitution. </p> <p>\"Of the last 32 opinion polls done on the constitution, only one has shown people in favour - and that was carried out by the European commission. </p> <p>\"A majority of voters are against the constitution in every region, every age group, every social group and among the supporters of every political party.\"</p>",
  "For much of the last century China's communist government claimed, in the words of the revolutionary anthem: \"The east is red.\" Now, however, it is warning that the colour most likely to be associated with the country in the future is grey. <p>The world's most populous nation is rapidly growing old, and as a new white paper on pensions revealed this week, the demographic change could undermine economic growth and social stability unless the government takes radical steps to prepare for a wave of hundreds of millions of new retirees. </p> <p>China is far from unique in worrying about its wrinkles, but it has particular cause for concern because of the speed at which it is ageing and its lack of resources to deal with the consequences. </p> <p>Like its neighbour Japan - the fastest ageing country in the world - and many other developed nations, China is growing old because of medical advances. These have pushed up life expectancy and increased urbanisation, which tends to encourage people to have fewer children. </p> <p>But in China, extremist family planning policies have accelerated democratic change. In the 1950s and 60s, Mao Zedong encouraged couples to have babies so the country could grow bigger and stronger; by 1978, however, it was clear that this had put an intolerable strain on land and water resources, so the government made a complete U-turn by introducing the one-child policy that, with occasional modifications, has remained in place ever since. </p> <p>As a result, the number of people reaching retirement age is now fast outstripping the number of new entrants to the workforce. Currently 11% of the 1.3 billion population is over 60, a proportion that is expected to rise to 25% by 2030. By some estimates, the number of elderly people will almost quadruple between 2000 and 2040, to 397 million. </p> <p>In any society, this would pose huge challenges to the health, pension and welfare systems, but Chinese policy makers are alarmed that their poor country is particularly ill prepared to cope with this rich-country phenomenon. </p> <p>Most other nations experiencing ageing pressures are advanced economies with well-developed social security structures; China, by contrast, has yet to replace the \"iron rice bowl\" socialist system, which it scrapped at the start of market reforms 25 years ago. </p> <p>Although the economy has been surging forward at the rate of 9% per year ever since, the country's health and pension systems have steadily deteriorated. </p> <p>A recent estimate by the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies showed that only 25% of the Chinese workforce was covered by formal retirement schemes. </p> <p>Most of those who receive benefits live in cities on the eastern seaboard, but even in these relatively affluent parts of China pension funds are in danger of drying up. </p> <p>Most of the 100 million migrant workers in China are reluctant to pay into pension systems that they may not be able to transfer to their home provinces. Even those with more secure employment wonder at the wisdom of paying into a system that may not be able to pay out when they are older. </p> <p>Their concerns are backed up by demographic statistics: currently three workers support every retiree, but by 2020 the ratio will have fallen to 2.5 adults for every retired person. </p> <p>The pay-as-you-go system has already collapsed, forcing the government into a shift of policy. In 2000 it established a national social security fund, which tops up pension contributions from individuals, employers and the government with the proceeds of state sales of shares and listings of state companies. These pension reserves, currently worth about 140bn yuan (\u00a39.5bn), are invested on domestic and foreign stock markets. </p> <p>The government is also trying to encourage individuals to take more responsibility for their pensions. Pilot programmes that offer incentives to people who make private pension arrangements have been established in Liaoning and a couple of other north-eastern provinces. </p> <p>Even if this is applied nationwide, it would be unlikely to pay for China's approaching old age, which will feel worse because more people are moving into the cities, where they are less likely to be able to rely on relatives for support. </p> <p>In the years ahead, increased urbanisation and a shrinking workforce will almost certainly force a rise in the retirement age from the current level of 60 for men and 55 for women. It is also more than likely to bring a major adjustment - and possibly even an end - to the one-child policy.</p>",
  "<p>The genetic profiles held by police for criminal investigations are not sophisticated enough to prevent false identifications, according to the father of DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist at Leicester University, said police DNA databases should hold more information to lessen the chances of a false positive. </p> <p>He was speaking at a briefing to mark the 20th anniversary of his pioneering of DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>Genetic profiles stored by police normally record the details of 10 specific parts of the long chain of molecules that make up a person's DNA. The chances of two unrelated people having the same details for all these 10 markers - and hence the chance of a false identification - is said to be about one in a billion. This method has traditionally been regarded as highly efficient at identifying suspects from DNA traces left at crime scenes. </p> <p>However, Prof Jeffreys said the increasing number of records being held on the police database - currently about 2.5m - meant that having only 10 markers per person was no longer foolproof. </p> <p>He suggested 15 or 16 markers to reduce the chances of two people having the same profile to one in more than a trillion. American law-enforcement authorities are already considering changing the profiles in their DNA databases along these lines. </p> <p>In Britain, DNA evidence has been used in countless criminal investigations and the police regard it as an invaluable tool. Peter Gill, of the Forensic Science Service, which administers the national DNA database for the police, said his agency was \"confident that the 10 markers currently used are sufficient\". </p> <p>He said: \"The chance of an adventitious match is fairly small, yet we never discount the possibility, and all our reporting officers are aware of this. </p> <p>\"If the DNA profile is partial because the sample is degraded, then adventitious matches often occur. However, it is important to remember that the national DNA database is an intelligence database. This means that before a decision to prosecute can be given, all of the evidence in the case must be carefully considered. DNA is never reported in isolation. The jury makes its decision based on all of the evidence presented.\" </p> <p>Prof Jeffreys also gave a warning against keeping DNA records of people who had been wrongly suspected of crimes - something the police have been legally allowed to do since 2001. </p> <p>In certain parts of the country, this could lead to an over-representation of certain ethnic groups and could lead to resentment, he said. The solution was either to delete records of those who had been cleared of any offence or simply to extend DNA profiling to everyone in Britain. </p> <p>He also expressed reservations about the idea of extracting anything more than simple identification data from DNA. \"Police store not only the DNA profile but also the physical DNA,\" he said. \"If they have that, there is the long-term risk that people could access health information in the future. Police have absolutely no right to that information.\" </p> <p>He sought to calm civil liberty fears that police might reach the stage of producing Photofits based solely on DNA information, saying science would be a limiting factor. </p> <p>There are few robust tests for identifying physical characteristics from someone's DNA - such as hair and eye colour and broad ethnic origin - although research in the area is continuing. </p> <p>Outlining the challenges for DNA profiling, he said the basic science had been achieved, but the problems now lay in improving the technology. </p> <p>He asked: \"Can we speed up and simplify the procedure?\" Within a decade, he pointed out, police may have hand-held devices that could profile DNA samples they found at the scene of a crime in a process taking only a few seconds and costing a few pence.</p> <p><strong>A scientific revolution</strong></p> <p><strong> 1984 </strong> Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist at Leicester University, discovers DNA fingerprinting by accident during research while studying how genes differ between people and how they evolve. </p> <p><strong> 1985 </strong> His technique first used to reunite a boy with his family after an immigration dispute. It showed with a certainty of 99.997% that the boy was the true son of UK citizens originally from Ghana. </p> <p>Also in 1985, the notorious war criminal Josef Mengele's remains, thought to be buried in Brazil, were positively identified by Prof Jeffreys using DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p><strong> 1987</strong> UK patent granted. Prof Jeffreys licenses technology to Cellmark Diagnostics, a subsidiary of ICI. </p> <p><strong> 1988</strong> Colin Pitchfork is first person to be convicted on the basis of DNA evidence for the rape and murder of two girls in Leicestershire. DNA evidence rapidly gains acceptance in US and UK courts. </p> <p><strong> 1989</strong> First serious attempt made to have DNA evidence excluded from a criminal trial in murder case against New York handyman Jose Castro. Though scientists concluded the DNA evidence was flimsy, Castro later confessed.</p>",
  "<p>On August 6 2000, it rained fish over the Norfolk seaside town of Great Yarmouth. Thousands of freshly dead baby sprats, about two inches long, littered roofs and gardens following the downpour. Meteorologists made the sensible assumption that the fish had been dumped there by a waterspout, although no one reported seeing one. </p> <p>Falls of living creatures have been recorded for centuries. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History of 77AD, catalogued those involving a number of animals and suggested that the seeds of the creatures are contained in dust or slime carried by the winds. The most common culprits are fishes and frogs, but insects, worms, jellyfish, crabs and starfish have also experienced the joys of freefall. Other reports, while authentic, stretch the bounds of incredulity, featuring plummeting lemmings, rats, even alligators - one being found, following a loud splash, in the ballast bag of an airborne dirigible during WWII. </p> <p>Tornados and waterspouts remain the most likely culprits for most falls, but several questions remain. Some are intensely localised, appearing as if the creatures were dumped onto only one spot of ground, while often the critters involved are still alive, as if gently placed there, rather than dropped from the heavens. Falls almost always involve only one species; this can, in part, be explained: the wind picks up a load of material, then sifts it, leaving behind only those of a certain weight or shape. But why aren't other creatures or objects of similar proportions also found at fall sites? And, as in the Yarmouth case, there are few reports of witnesses to such freakish whirlwind phenomena. As the early 20th century compiler of scientific anomalies Charles Fort observed: \"A pond going up would be quite as interesting as frogs going down.\" </p> <p>As well as living matter, inorganic substances also crash to earth, including seeds, stones and sand. However, these pale in comparison to the mighty ice blocks. January 2000 saw several chunks weighing up to four kilograms each fall on Spain, but they're dwarfed by the 200kg titans that struck Brazil in 1995.The forces behind these monsters, involving sudden drops in atmospheric temperature caused by high concentrations of ions and aerosols, are only just beginning to be understood. In the meantime, as ever, watch the skies, and mind your head.</p>",

  "Galliard primary school in Edmonton, north London, began offering an after-school club six years ago after growing numbers of children were not being collected on time at 3.30pm at the end of the school day. <p>Since then it has introduced an even more popular breakfast club, which regularly attracts up to 100 youngsters, around a sixth of the school population. </p> <p>For 75p a day, the children can enjoy a healthy breakfast from 8am in the school hall before playing games and even watching children's TV. </p> <p>At the tail-end of the day, the after-school club is open until 6pm, offering facilities for supervised homework, sports and other activities for \u00a36 a session. The school is fortunate to have five acres of playing fields and outdoor space. </p> <p>Countering fears about \"round-the-clock\" provision taking up the time and energy of teachers, the headteacher, Rosemarie Hopkins, points out that the breakfast club is run by the school's nursery nurses, while the after-school club has been contracted out to a private company, Dynamite. </p> <p>Very few children are sent to both the breakfast and after-school club. </p> <p>\"It tends to be one or the other to fit in with parents' working patterns - many here are on flexitime - and I certainly don't have any concerns about large numbers of youngsters being here between 8am and 6pm,\" said Mrs Hopkins. </p> <p>The school is large, with three classes in each year group, and its catchment area includes one of the most socially deprived parts of the country. </p> <p>\"We have a very wide social spread here,\" said Mrs Hopkins. \"There are a lot of ethnic minority children and those from asylum-seeking and one-parent families. </p> <p>\"It's fair to say that many children who go to the breakfast club get a better meal and start to the day than they would if they stayed at home. </p> <p>\"Importantly, they are also here to start their lessons on time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Honufa came to Dhaka last year. Severe erosion on her family's patch of land on one of the islands in the mouth of the Ganges forced the young Bangladeshi woman to leave her village for the capital. She took a boat and then an overnight bus and ended up in a shantytown called Bari Badh, which sprawls on the slopes of a new flood embankment. </p> <p>Honufa was lucky to find work immediately. She gets about 40p a day breaking bricks with a hammer. A tenth of what she earns goes on fresh water, the same on transport, but almost a third is needed to pay the rent for the room which she shares with two other women and three young children. </p> <p>It's seven foot square, built of bamboo, rusty corrugated iron and cardboard and squats on stilts over a fetid lagoon. The monsoon-swollen water swirls just a few feet below the floor. A latrine at the end of a walkway empties straight into the water. Last month, the whole community of 5,000 people was flooded out. </p> <p>Bari Badh is not typical of Dhaka's slums, some of which are long established and reasonably secure with electricity and drainage. It appeared three years ago, as soon as the embankment was built and it will probably not exist in three years because businessmen are already filling in the lagoon with rubbish in advance of building more solid homes. </p> <p>When that happens, Honufa and the others will be moved on to new, equally vulnerable slums on a new edge of one of the world's most rapidly growing cities. Dhaka, growing more than 5% a year, will have exploded from fewer than 600,000 people in 1961 to a projected 22 million in 2030. </p> <p>Next week, the UN's world urban forum meets in Barcelona and world leaders and demographers will hear that the number of slum dwellers like Honufa could double within 25 years to more than two billion people, almost one in four of the world's projected population. Two days later, the United Nations population fund will release its annual state of the world report which will show that almost 95% of the expected 2.5 billion increase in global population expected over same period will be in African and Asian cities. By then, more than 80% of north America, Europe, Australia and Latin America, and half of Asia and Africa will probably be living in urban areas. </p> <p>Put the global population and poverty trends together and it's clear that the world is making a major transition at a breathtaking pace. Sometime in the next two years, humanity will cross, probably forever, the line from being a rural species to an urban one. It will mark a turning point, a revolution potentially as significant as the passage from the middle ages to the modern age, which will redefine culture, politics and the way we all live. </p> <p>The scale of the redistribution of people now taking place is vast. Just 100 years ago, only one in seven of the world lived in a town or city and there were 16 places thought to have more than one million people. Today there are more than 400 cities with over one million and in 15 years time, a further 150 are expected to join the club. The global urban population increased 36% in the 1990s alone. </p> <p>Contrary to popular imagination, however, the future is not expected to be a world of mega cities like Dhaka, Cairo, or Manila. According to a new book by a group of demographers working with the Washington-based US National Research Council (NRC), the lion's share of the world population increases over the next 25 years will be in towns and cities with fewer than one million people. They expect these places to account for 60% of the developing country urban population. Cities of from one to five million will house another 26%. </p> <p>The authors suggest that the largest cities, although stretched to the limit in poor countries to provide even minimal services for their inhabitants, will be well-placed to attract international money for housing, infrastructure and services. In 15 years, they expect 60 cities to have more than five million people. </p> <p>Of these, a premier league of about 30 \"world cities\" is developing, all of which are becoming dominant in their regions. The economic globalisation process, says the NRC team, is forcing them to compete more strongly with each other for events such as the Olympics, but also the world's financial markets and business centres. </p> <p>The authors fear, however, that the smaller cities will be increasingly left out and will be under-served by governments who will choose to funnel money into ever more dominant capitals. \"The implications of globalisation for smaller cities are potentially disturbing. If capital is diverted from smaller cities toprepare larger cities for their global debuts, significant costs for many of the developing world's urban dwellers could result,\" the authors say. </p> <p>Massive urbanisation means hundreds of already near-bankrupt cities trying to cope in 20 years with the kind of problems London or New York only managed to address with difficulty in 150 years. The strains are showing in a growing global freshwater and sanitation water crisis, air pollution leading to continent-wide smogs and 48-hour traffic gridlocks, and reports of dwindling food reserves in many countries. </p> <p>According to the UN, hundreds of cities will be in real trouble within a decade. In China, where urbanisation has been extreme in the past 15 years, 400 out of the 670 biggest cities already have serious water deficits. Elsewhere, many cities are depleting underground stocks and finding that saltwater is getting into the aquifers. </p> <p>Competition for supplies is leading to increased conflicts between industry and agriculture, and, while better management could clearly improve supplies in many places, cities are often right up against their financial or physical limits. </p> <p>Dhaka is one of the most extreme. Dr Azhurul Haq, head of the city's water and sewerage authority, speaks for many rapidly growing cities. \"The problem here is already so serious that it is hard to understand. Providing water is a nightmare. We need a minimum of 1.6bn litres of water a day. Our theoretical capacity is 1.35bn litres a day and our actual production is 1.26bn litres, which means that a lot of people cannot have water. Seventy per cent of people have no sewerage system at all and their waste finds its way to the rivers and lagoons; 90% of it is untreated. </p> <p>\"We have 370 wells, but only 60% of them work. We need to replace 600km of water pipe out of the 2,000km we have. Some pipes are made of asbestos cement, which is very dangerous. We also get 97% of our water from deep underground, which is lowering the water table and is not sustainable.\" </p> <p>Dr Haq says it would cost at least $400m to get Dhaka's water supplies and sanitation up to a minimum standard. The prospect of having to provide for the eight million more people expected to flock to the city in the next 20 years is daunting. \"We live from week to week,\" he says. \"It's all we can do\". </p> <p>What scares many governments, planners and policy makers is the very real prospect that the majority of cities in developing countries will become sprawling slums, with people living without piped water or sanitation, with poor standards of housing, and health and nutrition problems on a par with anything found in the most poverty-stricken rural areas today. </p> <p>Last year, the UN commissioned a 300-page report on the growth of slums. The authors found that slum dwellers account for an average 43% of the population of developing countries. In sub-saharan Africa the proportion of urban residents in slums is highest at 71.9%, while Oceania (Australasia and island groups of the South Pacific) had the lowest at 24.1%. South-central Asia accounted for 58%, east Asia 36.4%. </p> <p>They concluded that local authorities were already failing to keep up with the infrastructural problems posed by rapid urbanisation. More surprisingly, they suggested that the greatest underlying reason for the growth of slums was laissez-faire globalisation - the tearing down of trade barriers, the liberalisation and privatisation of national economies, structural adjustment programmes imposed on indebted countries by the IMF, and the lowering of tariffs promoted by the WTO. </p> <p>According to the authors, this \"fundamental\" economic restructuring of the world, which is seeing rich countries move away from manufacturing and poor countries industrialising, drove rapid urbanisation in the 1990s. In South Korea, cities have been flooded with new arrivals since world trade rules allowed cheap, subsidised rice and other food imports to flood into the market. Fishermen in Senegal, Mexico, Ghana and elsewhere had left the countryside because the global fishing fleets have not only denuded catches, but made it impossible for small operators to compete with big foreign fleets. </p> <p>The young of Burkina Faso and Mali had largely left for cities throughout west Africa in hope of work, rather than try to scrape a living off marginal land. It was seldom the process of globalisation alone that made people leave the land, the authors found, but often the expectation of work and fulfilment, fuelled by global TV networks. </p> <p>But the authors found that globalisation wasn't just one of the major causes of urbanisation, it was actually making life worse for the poor in cities. It may have offered unparalleled opportunities for entrepreneurs, but barely any of the benefits of increased trade were reaching the poor. Research in sub-saharan countries found conditions deteriorating throughout the 1990s in many cities. </p> <p>In the past decade - the period of the greatest wealth creation in history, as well as the largest recorded growth in cities - the rich had gained and the poor had lost. Some developing countries, the authors suggested, would have done better to stay out of the globalisation process altogether if they had the interests of their own people in mind. </p> <p>The situation may actually be worse than imagined. According to Diana Mitlin and David Satterthwaite of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) in London, the scale and depth of urban poverty is underestimated because of the way poverty is measured in poor countries. They suspect that the poorest half of the urban population may be as malnourished, ill and exploited as the poorest people in rural areas. If this is the case, it demands a different approach from governments and international charities who traditionally focus on rural areas. </p> <p>But is it possible to have cities free from slums? The consensus is yes, but only if countries help to prevent their cities being swamped by congestion, environmental degradation and social unrest. The onus will be on cities themselves, and particularly the self-organising slum dwellers, to find solutions. </p> <p>The solutions, says David Satterthwaite, may not be with global bodies or national governments but with local authorities and urban grassroots groups. He says large-scale self-help community groups are now working together and beginning to take over from traditional developers. </p> <p>\"Poor people are becoming the world's most important builders and planners,\" he says. \"All over the world slum dwellers are organising themselves. In India, the National Slum Dwellers federation, with 750,000 members, is working in 50 cities and has provided cheap, but good homes for more than 35,000 households. In Mumbai they have built toilets that serve 750,000 people. </p> <p>\"A transnational movement of the urban poor and homeless with millions of member households is growing rapidly. The evidence from many nations that community-driven approaches are more effective and far more cost-effective that conventional government programmes.\" </p> <p>\"It's easy to be pessimistic about the problems,\" says Ms Maitlin. \"But the energy of people to improve their environments is enormous. People are investing a lot because it means so much to them. You can see real progress when people have a vision and get together with local government.\" Local government is critically important, she says. </p> <p>Molly Sheehan, of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, says: \"Cities are where most of the world's people will live and where an even greater share of the world's resources will be used in the future - from the vehicles' exhaust that pollutes and warms the atmosphere, to the urban demand for timber that denudes forests.\" </p> <p>She adds, more optimistically: \"But they also hold enormous potential for environmental and social progress. Throughout history, higher levels of health and education come after periods of urbanisation.\" </p> <p><strong>Further reading</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Challenge of Slums, UN-Habitat report, ISBN 1844070379, Earthscan, \u00a325 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cities Transformed, ed Mark Montgomery et al, ISBN 1844070905, \u00a329.95 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Squatter Citizen, ed Jorge E Hardoy and David Satterthwaite, ISBN 1853830208, Earthscan, \u00a319.95 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sustainable Cities, ed David Satterthwaite, ISBN 185383601X, Earthscan, &amp;#;163;16.95 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.un.org/issues/m-pop.asp\">UN population resources</a></p>",
  "<p>Microsoft's MSN division launched its music download service in the US last week, in response to Apple's iTunes. Of course, the two companies have different strategies. Apple has created a proprietary service where it controls everything: digital rights management (DRM), servers, iTunes software and iPod portable players. </p> <p>Microsoft is trying to create a platform with dozens of alternative music services such as Napster, featured in Windows Media Player 10, and many device manufacturers. This provides more choice, as long as you choose Microsoft's proprietary software. </p> <p>The theory is that a platform supported by thousands of companies will eventually overwhelm a single supplier. It won't happen tomorrow, but Microsoft has $61bn in the bank and can afford to wait. </p> <p>Microsoft's strategy is also different from Apple's in that Microsoft is more interested in video than audio. The MSN Music service also has tabs for TV and video and, to support the launch, Microsoft unveiled a new version of its multimedia player, WMP10. Microsoft also showcased new \"video iPods\" using its Portable Media Center (PMC) software, such as the \u00a3370 Creative Zen and Samsung's YH-999. </p> <p>PMC users will be able to download movies from CinemaNow, or videos of Major League Baseball games. They will also be able to sync their PMC with their Windows Media Center PC and take their TV programmes with them in Microsoft's Recorded TV Show file format (dvr-ms). </p> <p>Perhaps few people have realised how far Microsoft wants to extend its video formats beyond the PC. It is offering them for TV and video on demand delivered over the internet and by cable operators using IPTV, for movies on DVD, and even for local cinema showings. </p> <p>This is not going to be easy. First, the TV and movie industries don't want to be locked into one software supplier, especially not Microsoft. Second, they want their formats to stay the same for years, not be patched every month and updated annually. </p> <p>Microsoft has therefore struggled to make progress. But a few cable companies are trying Microsoft's TV Foundation Edition, such as Comcast in the US and Megacable and others in Mexico, while Bell Canada, Swisscom/ Bluewin and India's Reliance Info comm will pilot Microsoft's IPTV. </p> <p>Also, both next-generation DVD formats, HD-DVD and Blu-Ray, have adopted Microsoft's WM9 video codec alongside MPeg-4 and AVC, and Microsoft has submitted it to the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers for consideration as an official standard. </p> <p>Business users may wonder what this has to do with them. Well, Windows Server 2003 includes the Windows Media 9 server, and Windows desktops usually run WMP. Not many businesses use streaming video in enterprise applications, or broadcast TV-quality video to desktop PCs over their local area network, but the capability is already there. </p> <p>In five years, you might find Microsoft's video system everywhere, and wonder how it got there.
