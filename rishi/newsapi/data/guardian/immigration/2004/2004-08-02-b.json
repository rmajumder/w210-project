  "<p>In the glorious days of empire, a gentleman's ears knew what to expect of the sounds of an English summer: tinkling ice cubes in a gin and tonic; rippling applause from the cricket pavilion; the clunk of a neatly swung croquet mallet. In the intervening years, however, our aural landscape began to change. These days, a chap is more likely to tune in to a party in the park or a rowdy street carnival. And jolly old croquet has disappeared from the public consciousness. In modern Britain, croquet suffers from a distinctly provincial image; manicured lawns presided over by officious \"life-member\" committee men munching cucumber sandwiches. Cliche perhaps, but as a representation of \"association croquet\", the prevalent form of the sport in the UK, it is pretty accurate. </p> <p>Last year, the game's status as a fusty colonial-era relic seemed to be confirmed by Lord McLaurin, then chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, who warned that should his own sport fail to get its administrative house in order, cricket was in danger of becoming \"a former sport of the summer ... like croquet\". Predictably, responses of jowl-wobbling indignation hit the letters desk of the Daily Telegraph. Yet amid the grumbling from croquet clubs around the country were some more progressive voices. </p> <p>For the past two decades a quiet war has been raging over the future of this quintessentially British pastime. It is a story of sporting rebellion in middle England and of how a sedate summer diversion became an ally of feminism in the patriarchal society of the Arab world. </p> <p>With its origins in 13th-century France, the game of association croquet dates back to Ireland in the 1830s. After crossing the Irish sea, it eventually became the founding sport of the All England Club in 1877, before making the mistake of throwing its lot in with another fledging summer sport, lawn tennis. During the Edwardian era, the game enjoyed aristocratic patronage and throughout the first world war was considered a civilising influence against the horrors of that particular conflict. </p> <p>Put simply, the aim of association croquet is to manoeuvre two balls through a series of hoops before striking them against a peg at the centre of the lawn. By a combination of \"running\" hoops and striking an opponent's balls, players build a tally of points in the way a snooker player might build a break. The better the player, the longer he can keep his opponent out of the game. </p> <p>Among more accomplished exponents, the game's labyrinthine tactics can turn matches into esoteric mental jousts, likened by enthusiasts to \"chess on grass\". For the beginner, the downside is that it can take two years until you have the faintest idea of what's going on. </p> <p>But in recent years, an aggressive interloper has appeared. \"Golf croquet\" was originally developed by British soldiers in officers' clubs around Cairo at the end of the 19th century. Shorter and more combative than association croquet, when the British left, the game was refined by groundstaff at Cairo's Gezira country club. Unlike the break-building tactics of association rules, golf croquet players actively contest hoops - once one ball goes through, a point is scored and play moves to the next hoop. </p> <p>The rapid-fire nature of the game has seen its stock rise swiftly around the world. Last month, when the sixth world golf croquet championships kicked off at the Sussex County Croquet Club in Brighton, there were players from Japan and South Africa. Most spectators, however, had come to see the Egyptians, including the favourite, Salah Hasan, a baby-faced caterer from Cairo, and twice world champion. </p> <p>What makes Egyptians so good at it? \"It's the way we play,\" says Hasan, who believes British players are too cautious. \"In Egypt,\" he says, \"the game is played in highly competitive evening leagues and our long season [August to June] means we are always practising, which in Europe is not possible because of the weather.\" </p> <p>In Egypt, the rise of golf croquet has led to some interesting social repercussions, not least in the sporting aspirations of the country's women. Of Egypt's 2,500 players, around 30% are female. In what remains a male-dominated society, it is one of the rare sports where men and women compete on an equal footing. In 2005, Egypt plans to host the first women-only world championship. </p> <p>Leading the charge back in Brighton is Manal Ali Mohsen, a politics graduate from Cairo who, in just four years, has risen to become Egypt's number-two woman player. The number one, Naheed Hassan, has been playing for 30 years. \"In Egypt,\" says Ali Mohsen, \"women use golf croquet as a social occasion. Players come from tight communities and my mother played for 30 years.\" </p> <p>Despite the global inroads made by golf croquet, in Britain the association game remains king. Forty of the world's top 100 players hail from these shores and every two years, when the best of these compete in the MacRobertson Shield - croquet's equivalent of the Ashes and named after Macpherson Robertson, an Australian confectionery millionaire - Britain regularly steals the honours. </p> <p>But things could have been different. On April 7 1984 at the Hurlingham Club in London, the Croquet Association, the game's ruling body, held an annual general meeting to vote on an issue threatening to change England's green and pleasant croquet landscape forever. Keen to secure mainstream television coverage for the sport, a splinter movement had put together a pilot television programme. Believing it to have wider appeal than the ponderous association game, they chose to promote golf croquet, then little-known in Britain. The BBC was interested - now all that was required was for the game's hierarchy to rubberstamp the project. </p> <p>Parking his tanks on the establishment's lawns was Stephen Mulliner, who had earned his association stripes, but was also one of the few Englishmen to have come close to challenging the Egyptian hegemony by placing fourth in the 2000 world championships. </p> <p>In 1984, he believed the opportunity to milk the cash cow feeding other minority sports was too good to miss. \"We were coming out of a bit of a recession and advertising revenues had begun to pick up,\" he says. \"Incongruous as its seems, our main rivals [for sponsorship] were snooker and darts and they had got their feet back in the door.\" And in golf croquet, he argued, \"the emphasis is on one hoop at a time and it's far more telegenic\". </p> <p>The game's old guard panicked, fearing this bastard version of the game would swamp Britain's clubs and sound a death knell for the association format. The vote itself was the sweetest of English fudges. Of the Croquet Association's 1,500 membership, only 73 - less than 5% - bothered to turn up. After intense lobbying, the result could hardly have been closer: 35 members voted in favour of promoting golf croquet on television, 36 against. </p> <p>Still, Mulliner remains optimistic. \"The extravagant statements made about the doom that would engulf the association game have proved nonsense,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Golf croquet is now the lifeblood of some of our smaller clubs. It's the better contest. Some association players may not like it ... but the writing's on the wall.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Tennis</strong><br> A former coach of Mark Philippoussis, Tommy Haas and Monica Seles was found guilty yesterday of three counts of indecent assault and six of gross indecency against a female student at Melbourne's Wesley College 20 years ago. The victim, now 33, told a Victorian County Court she had a three-year sexual relationship with 48-year-old Gavin Hopper from January 1985, when she was 14. He had pleaded not guilty and plans to appeal. Hopper, in custody as he awaits sentencing, runs a Gold Coast tennis academy with the former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash. </p> <p><strong> Indy cars</strong><br> Yorkshire's Dan Wheldon lost ground on his Indy Racing League rivals despite third place behind Buddy Rice and Tony Kanaan in the Michigan Indy 400.

  "Almost alone in the democratic world, we British have no written constitution protecting our basic civil and political rights. We have no charter defining the scope of the powers of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Where parliament remains passive, the government, clothed in ancient monarchical authority, exercises unbridled prerogative powers - to wage war, to make binding treaties, to control the civil service and to issue or withhold passports. <p>Post Hutton and Butler, provided that ministers act in \"good faith\", ministerial responsibility for gross errors of judgment is written in water - except at election time. </p> <p>There was another example of the abuse of prerogative powers when the government announced its decision not to allow British citizens to take complaints of breaches of the UN covenant on civil and political rights to the UN human rights committee. We are alone in the European Union in this respect. What the government dislikes about giving us the right of petition is that it would bring into play the covenant's guarantee of equality without discrimination - a guarantee that is enshrined in the written constitutions of the other European states. The government is judge in its own cause, and we citizens can do nothing about this denial of a basic constitutional right except to campaign for better government. </p> <p>Ever since the American and French revolutions, British political leaders have rejected the idea of entrenching fundamental rights in a supreme constitution. For 40 years British governments have exported written constitutions to new democracies across the former empire while opposing any proposal to place themselves under similar constraints at home. </p> <p> The two principles of the unwritten Victorian constitution under which we are governed are parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law. But parliamentary supremacy usually means executive domination. As for the role of the independent judiciary, it is essential in ensuring that governments do not act lawlessly or use their powers to excess, but the courts are subordinate to an executive-dominated parliament: lions under the throne, and even their independence can be undermined by political interference. </p> <p>For British governments, power is delightful, and absolute power is absolutely delightful. Parliament may pass a human rights act, but a future parliament could repeal or emasculate it. In 1968, parliament enacted emergency legislation to deprive 200,000 British Asian passport holders fleeing from racial persecution in East Africa of their right to enter and live in their country of citizenship. The statute was racially motivated, but there was no remedy in our courts because parliament can use its law-making powers as it (or the government) pleases. Recently, the government came close to persuading a supine parliament to pass a law depriving vulnerable asylum-seekers of access to judicial review to challenge abuses of Home Office powers. It was only the threat of defeat in the Lords that induced them to abandon this measure.</p> <p>The systemic failings of the British system will not be cured by exhorting parliamentarians to meet the challenge of the democratic deficit, or even by creating a better voting system for parliament. We need more fundamental reform: a written constitution that defines the nature and limits of the powers of each arm of the state, and provides legal protection against the misuse of legislative as well as executive power. Instead of relying upon the European convention on human rights, we would enjoy the protection of a British bill of rights, designed to meet British needs. </p> <p>A British constitution would identify the core values of our liberal democracy within the wider European context. Armed with a British constitution, our negotiators in Brussels would have stronger bargaining powers in their dealings with EU institutions.</p> <p>Those core constitutional values would provide a better basis for the civic education of each new generation of British citizens than David Blunkett's clumsy attempts to induce a sense of \"Britishness\" and loyalty to the state among Britain's alienated ethnic and religious minorities. </p> <p>A written constitution would replace the present mass of verbose and indigestible devolution legislation. The single statute regulating the mayor of London and the GLA is far longer than any written constitution for an entire nation. The new legislation for regional assemblies in England and Wales will add further incoherence to the existing mess. </p> <p>A written constitution would confer discretionary powers on the executive and leave leeway for a dynamic interpretation by a modern, fairly chosen judiciary. </p> <p>The time is over-ripe for Britain to join the rest of the democratic world by placing government under the supreme law of a constitution approved by the British people as a whole. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Lord Lester QC is a Liberal Democrat peer and practises at Blackstone's Chambers. <br> Email: <a href=\"mailto:lestera@parliament.uk\">lestera@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> It would take a hard heart not to feel for Dick Cheney. The problem with being hired as the guy who'll make George Bush look good by comparison is that when the president's in a tight spot, you have to sink to quite a level to deflect attention. And so, with Bush hit by the so-called Kerry bounce after last week's Democratic convention, it fell to Dick to pull something pretty special out of the bag on his visit to a campaign rally in Arizona on Saturday. But the vice-president's nothing if not a closer. Preparing to cover the event, the Arizona Daily Star submitted its photographer's name and credentials in the usual manner, but were amazed on Friday to receive a call from the White House asking the paper to disclose the journalist's race. Having never heard such a request in her 26-year career, managing editor Teri Hayt refused to divulge the information and asked if the photographer - Mamta Popat - had been singled out for racial profiling because of her name. Cheeringly, a Republican campaign spokesman declined to elaborate, so we'll have to leave this everyday story of homeland security folk here. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Just when we were starting to enjoy the FA personnel haemorrhage - it's like one of those movies where the entire royal family gets wiped out, leaving Jim Carrey as the closest heir - the smile is wiped off our stupid lowbrow faces. One man, we recall in horror, has long been rumoured to be interested in the top job at Soho Square, so can it be long before Alastair Campbell's name finds its way on to a list of runners and riders to replace long-faced former chief executive Mark Palios? Admittedly, Alastair's a slightly more savvy media operator than erstwhile communications director Colin Gibson - although on the basis of the latter's News of the World fiasco, so is Sooty. But unless the whole episode has been some elaborate FA plot to test the credulity of the nation (certainly possible), this conclusion to it would seem ill-advised. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Speaking of assaults on the national psyche, we shall finally reveal our plans for Noel Edmonds tomorrow. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Many thanks, meanwhile, for all your suggestions as to which Guardian staff could be masons. Unfortunately, we're still in the dark as to whether any of the myriad people in the building with the power to fire us might be compromised by such speculation, so Shop A Guardian Mason remains tantalisingly on hold for now. We are, however, most aggrieved to discover that being female rules us out of joining the organisation for personal gain, and will be proposing a replacement campaign - Let's Make Corruption Equal Opportunities - in a call to the Grand Lodge later today. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> We're grateful to Channel 4 News for broadcasting Craig Unger's visit to an event celebrating Saudi culture last Saturday, which took an amusing turn when the Saudi ambassador, Prince Turki al-Faisal, approached the House of Bush, House of Saud author for a chat. The pair exchanged a few pleasantries at the Syon Park venue, before the ambassador suggested that, had Craig actually visited Saudi Arabia, he wouldn't have written his book. A visit would have been lovely, agreed Craig with studied politeness, but unfortunately the Saudi government had turned down his request for a visa. A short pause, then back to the studio. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> There are further developments, finally, in the tale of Islamophobe Sunday Telegraph columnist Will Cummins and British Council press officer Harry Cummins, who a Diary source alleges to be one and the same person. Harry - who denies being Will - has been suspended on full pay, we are told by communications chief Christopher Wade, while the British Council investigates the claims. As for Will, he did not appear in the Sunday Telegraph this weekend, but we trust he enjoyed the sunshine.</p>",
  "The Home Office today dismissed as speculation reports that David Blunkett's department will be split in two after the next general election to create a \"ministry of justice\" and \"ministry of rights\". <p>The plan - the latest in a long line of schemes to devolve elements of the criminal justice system from responsibilities for immigration, freedom of information and elections - would see both the current Home Office and Department for Constitutional Affairs dissolved and their briefs divided between the two new ministries. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office today said talk of a justice ministry had been \"around for years\" - but he did not dismiss the idea outright. </p> <p>The spokesman later added: \"As a matter of departmental restructuring, this would be a matter for No 10.\"</p> <p> Such a reorganisation would be in the gift of the prime minister, who is reported in today's Daily Telegraph to be considering the move in the wake of a successful third election triumph. </p> <p>Asked about the story this morning, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is an old story - it is clearly August.\"</p> <p>Any Whitehall reshuffle is unlikely to come before the next general election at the earliest because Mr Blunkett's plans on crime, anti-social behaviour and ID cards are intended to be the central plank of the government's legislative plans in the run-up to voting. </p> <p>With a contest tentatively pencilled in for next May, the Home Office is widely believed to have an unprecedented six bills lined up for November's Queen's speech, which will set the legislative programme for the coming year. </p> <p>Though the parliamentary session would be interrupted by a general election, the home secretary - backed by Mr Blair - is thought to be planning to introduce bills setting up a national serious crime squad of 5,000 officers, piecemeal legislation bringing in ID cards, a bill to extend anti-social behaviour orders, a bill to lower the burden of proof in terrorism trials and a shakeup in sentencing tariffs. </p> <p>Electorally, Labour has been buoyed by its perceived success in tarring the Liberal Democrats as \"soft on crime\" in recent byelections after the party opposed the bill introducing the original anti-social behaviour orders. </p> <p>Playing the law and order card in the run-up to the election would help party strategists again trap the Tories and Lib Dems into being seen as either backing Labour or siding with criminals rather than victims. </p> <p>One Blair aide was quoted in the press last week, when details of the legislative plan leaked, as saying: \"We are going to ensure that law and order is debated in the Commons every day in the six months before the election.\" </p> <p>The Tories themselves plan a big crime initiative before the party conference season this autumn. </p> <p>There has always been a Whitehall turf battle between the criminal justice elements of the Home Office brief and the responsibilities currently being carried out by the Department of Consitutional Affairs. That department, headed by Lord Falconer and only created last summer, currently handles the courts system, tribunals, freedom of information, data protection and human rights. </p> <p>The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, is believed to have clashed frequently in recent times with the home secretary over the independence of the judiciary and the rights of asylum seekers under human rights legislation.</p>",
  "<p>In the British army, when an officer was drummed out, his epaulettes would be ceremonially ripped from his uniform. Priests are defrocked and enter the secular world in their underpants. Lawyers are disbarred and doctors struck off. But no one, as far as I know, has ever been de-Nobelled - stripped, that is, of the Nobel prize. Like the Soviet government (as Solzhenitsyn wryly put it), Stockholm's motto is: \"We never make mistakes.\" </p> <p>In one egregious case, the committee did err. And, if the campaign to de-Nobel Egas Moniz succeeds, Portugal - having a lousy year, what with Euro 2004 and its forest fires - will lose one of its two laureates (the other, novelist Jose Saramago, seems safe enough). </p> <p>Moniz invented human lobotomy in 1935. American surgeons had earlier observed that if you hacked the frontal lobes off chimpanzees' brains, the primates stopped jumping round the monkey house. The 1930s was a time when the medical profession was unimpeded by petty restrictions. In Tuskegee in 1932, hundreds of black American suffering from syphilis were denied drugs to see what happened. They got very sick. </p> <p>Moniz - despite the lack of surgical expertise - went to work on the (unconsenting and mainly female) inmates of Lisbon's asylums. As with the chimps, the results were dramatic. Moniz trumpeted to the world the beneficial effects of lobotomy. He duly got his Nobel prize in 1949. He was, the committee said, \"a wonderful man\". Not all of his patients agreed; Moniz's career as a psychosurgeon ended when an ungrateful lobotomee shot him, shattering his spine. </p> <p>The operation was popularised in the US by Walter Freeman who trundled round the states in his \"lobotomobile\", demonstrating his \"ice pick and hammer technique\" to any hospital that would let him into their operating theatre. Failing that, he would operate in hotel rooms, lobotomising children for \"delinquent behaviour\" and housewives who had lost the will to do the washing-up. </p> <p>Freeman is immortalised in the the 1982 biopic Frances, where the heroine (played by Jessica Lange) is given the works in front of an admiring audience by a mallet- and ice pick-wielding Freeman boasting he can do 10 an hour and \"lobotomy gets 'em home.\" </p> <p>Most, one gathers, came home vegetables - at best Stepfordized; at worst, zombies (Frances Farmer was the latter). The asylums loved lobotomy: it cost a mere $250 and kept the noise down in the wards. </p> <p>Protest came from some unlikely places: notably the USSR (which preferred overdosing its inconvenient citizens with psychotropic drugs) and L Ron Hubbard's Scientologists. But mostly, it was the writers and film-makers who got across to the public the full horror of carving up the human brain like a Thanksgiving turkey. Lobotomy inspired Tennessee Williams's 1958 play, Suddenly Last Summer (just ending a successful West End revival). Williams had a sister who had undergone the operation. He knew, too, that it was sometimes inflicted on gays - to render them \"morally sane\". Ken Kesey won a Pulitzer in 1962 for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, in which the hero, Randle McMurphy, is lobotomised because Big Nurse simply can't stand his unruly behaviour. </p> <p>By 1975, when the Oscar-winning film starring Jack Nicholson came out, lobotomy was history. Freeman had lost his surgeon's licence in 1965, after killing a patient with his icepick. But Moniz (who died in 1955) still has his Nobel prize. The campaign to strip him of it has been led by Christine Johnson, who had a close relative destroyed by lobotomy and has mobilised on her website (<a href=\"http://www.psychosurgery.org\">psychosurgery.org</a>) a powerful lobby of victims and their families. The Nobel Foundation wrote to Johnson a couple of weeks ago declining to withdraw the award - although they declare themselves relieved that \"the medical profession can today offer much more humane and effective therapies for the severely mentally ill patients\". </p> <p>Should they de-Nobel Moniz? A no-brainer, I'd say.</p>",

Thanks to its peculiar geography, the wetlands, or hoars, are covered by six feet of water for six months every year. Homes are built on raised ground and usually the monsoon is welcome as it brings rich alluvial silt that fertilises paddy fields. </p> <p>Although the hoars are situated in one of the wettest places in the world, this year they became wetter. Flash floods have seen the water level rise four metres (12ft), engulfing homes, wiping out the rice crop and threatening to bring diarrhoea and dysentery as the floods recede. </p> <p>In the dozens of villages that dot the hoars, government officials say that more than 250,000 homes have been destroyed or made uninhabitable. \"It is the worst flood I can remember,\" says 83-year-old Barun Roy, a former MP for the nearby town of Sanumganj. \"We will face a crisis unless the government acts because all the crops were destroyed. Where will the people get seeds to plant from next year?\" </p> <p>Only accessible by boat, there are also fears that many people will be left stranded, unnoticed by relief efforts that are directed at the shelters found on dry land. </p> <p>Musamad Lima, 19, is typical of their plight. It takes 45 minutes in a speedboat from the edge of Shanir hoar to reach her wooden shack. \"The land around this house has just been washed away,\" she says. \"But I have decided to stay here with my sick father. I cannot leave but no one has come to help me.\" </p> <p>The local administration says it is trying its best to cope with the disaster. \"The first problem is food, as people have nothing to eat. For 500,000 people we need 200 tonnes of rice a day for six months. I can say that it would be difficult to sustain this level of consumption without outside help,\" says Mohammed Jafar Siddique, the deputy commissioner for Sanumganj district. </p> <p>The scarcity of food has seen prices of necessities such as rice, cooking oil, salt and kerosene shoot up - in some cases by 200%. Aid agencies also point out that there is an increasing danger of the spread of water-borne diseases. </p> <p>Even without the flood conditions, Sanumganj has only a third of the 160 doctors required for its population. \"The lack of medical help and the serious danger of famine-like conditions in Sanumganj means that we will have an emergency on our hands unless something is done,\" says Shashanka Saadi, who coordinates relief efforts for Action Aid in Bangladesh. </p> <p>The greatest challenge in Shanir hoar is how to get food and medicine to people stuck beyond the land swamped by flooding. Supplies cannot be airdropped be cause the waters would swallow them up. Aid agencies say boats are the only answer, but it will take cash and organisation to mobilise them. \"Only the army has that sort of resource but they have yet to be deployed,\" said Mr Saadi. </p> <p>It is becoming increasingly clear that the Bangladeshi government is grappling with a disaster whose size it initially failed to acknowledge until the homes, livestock and crops of millions of its people had been swept away. </p> <p>Until late last week, Bangladesh's ministers were repeating the message that there was \"adequate emergency relief\". This changed on Friday when an international appeal for help was launched by the prime minister, Khaleda Zia. </p> <p>Officially, 544 Bangladeshis have been killed, although the officials concede the real death toll is likely to be much higher. Disease, spread by foul water, will greatly increase the number of victims. There has been an alarming rise in the number of registered diarrhoea cases: nearly 47,000 have been afflicted since July 12. </p> <p>More than 30 million people have been made homeless or left marooned by the deluge, which covers two-thirds of the country. Half of the country's capital is under water, including its diplomatic district. The government estimates that $7bn (\u00a33.95bn) worth of damage has been done. The international community is reacting slowly. America has pledged $210m (\u00a3118m), and Britain has sent \u00a310m of aid. </p> <p>Stretching across a vast delta where three of the world's great rivers meet, Bangladesh is a flood-prone country. Not only does the country have its own monsoon rain to flush away through its river system, it also has to deal with neighbouring India's. </p> <p><strong>Swollen</strong></p> <p>This year the floodwater has come from the rivers that rise in the Himalayas, course through India, and then empty into Bangladesh. Torrential rains in Bihar, in northern India, have contributed to extensive flooding there, killing hundreds and leaving millions homeless. </p> <p>The water has swollen the Ganges as it rushes through the plains to Bangladesh. The water is also taking longer to empty into the Bay of Bengal because of unusually high tides. </p> <p>Every year there is concern about India's deforested hills and mountains and its flood-control programme, which Bangladeshis say silts up riverbeds on its side of the border. </p> <p>Standing on his wooden canoe full of empty nets, Jatinder Birma says there is no chance to catch the fish in Shanir hoar. \"Usually I catch enough fish to make 150 taka (\u00a31.50) a day. But for the last week I am only making 20 taka (20p). You see the fish need clean water to survive, not the mud that is now coming from India.\" </p> <p><strong>Casualties of the rains</strong></p> <p>Death toll from floods and monsoon rains across South Asia since June: </p> <p>Bangladesh: 544 <br> Nepal: 113 <br> Pakistan: 5 <br> India: 847<br></p> <p>comprising: </p> <p>Assam: 181 <br> Bihar: 601 <br> Kerala: 45 <br> Tripura: 3 <br> Uttar Pradesh: 17 <br></p> <p>Regional total: 1,509</p>",
  "<p>HSBC, the world's third-biggest bank by market value, today reported record first-half profits of $9.3bn (\u00a35bn), making it one of Europe's most profitable companies.</p> <p>For the six months to June 30, HSBC's profits were 53% higher than a year before, boosted by strong results at Household International, its US consumer finance unit.</p> <p>Household, which lends to poorer customers who have a weak credit history, contributed $1.9bn in first-half pre-tax profit, compared with $536m in the three months after HSBC acquired it last year. </p> <p>However, it made a substantial contribution to the bank's provisions for bad and doubtful loans, which increased to $2.8bn - up $429m from a year ago. The main reason for the increase was an additional quarter's charge of $1.2bn. HSBC, which is Britain's biggest bank, is on course for another bumper year after reporting full-year profits of \u00a37.7bn for 2003, the largest ever reported by a British bank. At the time, the bank had to fend off accusations that it was making excess profits.</p> <p>\"Our results reflect sound underlying revenue growth, a disciplined management of costs while investing for the future, and improved productivity,\" said the chairman, Sir John Bond.</p> <p>Sir John also cited improving economic conditions in many of HSBC's most important markets in comparison with the first half of last year, particularly in the US and Hong Kong. HSBC, which describes itself as the world's local bank, has three core geographical areas: Europe, Hong Kong and North America. </p> <p>In a reflection of how it has spread its businesses, HSBC saw Europe contribute $3bn in profits and Hong Kong $2.5bn, while North America pitched in with $3.4bn. HSBC is now expanding into the booming China market, where it is in discussion to acquire 19.9% of Bank of Communications.</p> <p>In the UK, where HSBC has cut 7,500 jobs - around 4,500 of which are going to low-cost centres overseas - Sir John said that implementation of a five-year strategic plan was well under way. </p> <p>The job cuts, which are, to a certain extent, offset by 1,000 new customer-facing jobs - have soured relations with unions. Unifi, the finance union, has begun drawing up a dossier to prove to City regulators that HSBC has introduced a sales culture that is detrimental to customer service. </p> <p>However, Sir John said that the changes in the UK, where HSBC has only 4% of the mortgage market, were essential. </p> <p>It recently appointed Michael Geoghegan, from its Mexico operations, to head the British division, with his remit being to boost sales at the same time as tackling costs. The British banking business makes 25% of the company's profit, but accounts for 33% of the costs.</p> <p>\"Some of the measures we are taking in the UK are painful but essential, and there are already signs that they are yielding results in terms of business growth,\" Sir John said.</p> <p>Mr Geoghegan declined to comment on speculation that HSBC could further improve its position in the UK by making a bid for Abbey National. </p> <p>HSBC is being pressed to act as a white knight by Abbey shareholders who are unhappy at the \u00a38bn takeover by Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain. Analysts, however, are sceptical about such a move, because HSBC is more interested in expanding in the US and Asia.</p>",
  "Following the murder of gay activist Brian Williamson in Kingston in June, the Jamaica Observer published a letter which read, \"To be gay in Jamaica is to be dead.\" <p>Since Williamson's death, Jamaica's gay community has been even more fearful than usual. The motive was officially given as robbery, but Williamson was the only \"out\" gay activist in the country; members of the Jamaican Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-Flag), an organisation that operates underground and anonymously, believe that homophobia made him a target. According to their estimates, his was the 30th killing of a gay man on the island since 1997. </p> <p>International human rights organisations have described Jamaica as one of the most homophobic places in the world; gay and lesbian relationships are largely conducted in secret. But, while prejudice and violence against gay men have hit the headlines following Williamson's murder and the ongoing controversy over Jamaican singer Beenie Man's lyrics (which call for the execution of gay men), the plight of lesbians in Jamaica has not attracted the same attention. Yet their lives are no less difficult: in a strongly-worded statement issued in June, Amnesty International highlighted the growing problem of vigilante action against gays and lesbians, and of their ill treatment and torture at the hands of the police. </p> <p>According to the Amnesty statement, gay men and women have been \"beaten, cut, burned, raped and shot on account of their sexuality. Once a person's homosexuality becomes known to family and community they are frequently at risk.\" </p> <p>Even speaking out anonymously can place a gay woman at risk. According to a recent report from the London-based charity Asylum Aid, one woman who appeared on a television show to speak (from behind a screen) about the persecution she had endured because of her sexuality was verbally abused and assaulted. \"The following day, a co-worker who had recognised her voice went as far as beating her up,\" states the report. \"Other women suspected of being lesbians have been raped and chased out of their homes and communities.\" </p> <p>Paula Ettelbrick, executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission says: \"Brian [Williamson]'s murder has really pushed things back. Now there are no public voices in Jamaica to speak out against homophobia. Lesbians face constant sexual harassment.\" Common terms of abuse include \"batty man\" for gay men and \"sodomite\" for women. </p> <p>Technically, it is not illegal to be gay in Jamaica, although the Offences Against The Person Act bans any kind of physical intimacy between men. Section 76 of the act bans anal sex between men, and between men and woman - although the majority of prosecutions involve gay men, who can serve 10 years in jail with hard labour if convicted. No statistics are currently available on the number of prosecutions of gay men under this legislation, but J-Flag plans to start collecting figures held at local police stations. </p> <p>Because there is no mention of same-sex relationships between women on the statute books, they are perhaps more likely to be the objects of vigilante action. Amnesty has received numerous reports of lesbian women being raped: rapists believe theirs is an appropriate penalty for \"unnatural\" sexual acts, and that it will \"reprogramme\" a lesbian's sexuality. \"There are reports of lesbians being singled out for attacks on the grounds of a 'mannish' physical appearance or other visible manifestations of sexuality,\" reads the June statement. Lesbians have reported gang rapes in public places, witnessed and condoned by other men and heterosexual women. Those heterosexuals who believe that sexuality is a private matter, and not a reason to abuse or vilify others, are often too scared to express any public support. </p> <p>Nor does the situation seem likely to improve. \"Both the main political parties here have said they are not going to address homophobia,\" says a spokesman for J-Flag. \"I lived in London for many years and feel very comfortable with my sexuality but when I returned to Jamaica I had to go back into the closet. This society makes you feel self-loathing for your sexuality.\" </p> <p>Brenda, a professional woman living in Kingston, has resigned herself to keeping her sexuality a secret. Her relationships with other women involve clandestine meetings in out-of-the-way places. \"I'm always checking my back,\" she says. \"Some of my friends told me not to go near them again when I said I was a lesbian. And my parents asked me to leave their house. Beatings and rapes of gay women are the norm and are not considered to be a crime here. Many women don't report them to the police because they know the police won't do anything.\" </p> <p>She says that, in a recent case, two lesbian women walking together in a public park were dragged into a maze by six men and raped, although they had been demonstrating no physical affection towards one another. </p> <p>\"In Jamaica, a woman is stigmatised if she doesn't have children,\" says Brenda. \"Some of my lesbian friends have had children just to cover up the fact that they are gay. Brian Williamson's murder has been a war cry to the heterosexual community. Last week, a group of gay people leaving a party had their cars ambushed by people throwing rocks.\" </p> <p>Brenda believes that Jamaica's very masculine society has contributed to the level of homophobia. \"Men have it drummed into them from an early age that it's wrong to be affectionate,\" she says. In October 2003, a study carried out by the University of the West Indies in Kingston found that 80% of Jamaican men and 25% of women believed that the natural role of women was to support men. Their search also found that the majority of Jamaican men see themselves as more powerful than women, and believe that their authority over women is inherent and God-given. </p> <p>A spokesman at J-Flag said he believed that, at the same time, Jamaican men felt marginalised within a hyper-masculine society. \"In tertiary education, only 25% of the students are men; 75% are women. Many men are unable to get good jobs because they are less well-educated. When they are brought up, girls are subjected to more discipline than boys - which is one of the reasons they are more likely to go on to higher education. Boys are more likely to be allowed to run free. We have a real problem with male role models, too. A lot of children grow up in single-parent families with no father present. </p> <p>\"We hear arguments that God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. Homophobia is an irrational fear of gay people and people worry that if they allow gay people to 'take over' there will be no more procreation and the human race will die out.\" </p> <p>A number of gay Jamaicans have claimed asylum in countries where they can express their sexuality openly, such as Canada, the US and the UK. But, according to a recent report from Asylum Aid, Jamaican lesbians who claim asylum in the UK do not get a sympathetic reception. The report - entitled Safe For Whom? - states that Jamaica is one of more than 20 places on the British government's \"safe country list\": asylum applications from these countries are routinely dismissed by the Home Office. </p> <p>Sophia Ceneda of the Refugee Women's Resource Project at Asylum Aid is critical of the government's inclusion of Jamaica on its \"safe\" list. \"Recourse to protection is non-existent for Jamaican lesbians,\" she says. \"Deporting lesbians back to Jamaica puts their lives at risk.\" </p> <p>A Home Office letter sent to a lesbian asylum seeker from Jamaica acknowledges that public figures in the media, the church and politics have voiced homophobic views, and that there have been numerous reports of acts of violence against gays but adds, \"Nevertheless it is understood that this attitude is not universal: police officers in Jamaica have protected homosexuals from violent assaults, and Jamaica's public defender, who has publicly condemned homophobic violence, has stated that the perpetrators must be punished. But he cited the reluctance of victims of assault to come forward as a reason for the failure of many investigations into homophobic attacks.\" </p> <p>The government is committed to protecting genuine refugees, and asylum is granted where case-workers are satisfied that an asylum seeker has a well-founded fear of persecution under the terms of the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees. </p> <p>Janet, a 38-year-old lesbian from Jamaica who has claimed asylum in the UK, is still waiting for a decision on her case from the Home Office. \"Whatever happens, I can't go back to Jamaica,\" she says. \"I'd rather die in the UK than be sent back.\" There are scars all over her body from the beatings she has received, part of the evidence she has submitted to immigration caseworkers. She has often needed hospital treatment as a result, but never told doctors and nurses why she had been assaulted. \"I've been beaten so many times when I've been out with friends that I could write a book about it,\" she says. \"I tried so many times to stop being a lesbian but it's the way my body works. It's the way I was born and I'll be myself until the day I die.\" </p> <p>One day, she says, she was at home with a female partner when a child from the neighbourhood saw them together and went round knocking on doors, telling people to come and see. \"A large crowd gathered outside my house and they beat down my front door. They kept shouting 'Sodomite girl, leave this place.' \" </p> <p>Janet claimed asylum in the UK two years ago. The year before she left Jamaica, she was coming home from a party when two men held up her taxi at traffic lights, forced her out of the car, demanded oral sex and raped her. \"I couldn't believe it the first time I saw a gay couple at a train station here being openly affectionate to each other,\" she says. \"There were lots of people around but none of them started beating or abusing the couple. Coming here, I felt safe for the first time. Gay people can lead an open life here.\" </p> <p>In Kingston, Brenda says she is determined to stay and to resist the intimidation as best she can. \"I'm 37 now and maybe by the time I'm in my 60s I'll see some tolerance of gay people appearing in Jamaican society. I hope things change in my lifetime.\"</p>",
  "<p>You might wonder why we need a new version of Kenneth Grahame's classic when Alan Bennett's National Theatre version is still fresh in the memory. I wondered for the entire two-hour length of this show. Still, I suppose that David Conville and David Gooderson's adaptation is clearly aimed more at children than the Bennett version, which, despite its charm, appeals largely to adults who long for a return to Edwardian values and view the weasels as a distinctly lower class of animal. </p> <p>What this version lacks in theatrical sophistication, it makes up for with pantomime. The horse, the cross-dressing, the washerwoman's strip, the cut-out train and the custard pie delivered as punishment to the chief weasel all hail from that tradition, and the whole show is big, bright and very, very broad. </p> <p>Even if it lacks a reflective tone, it can still be slow-going as episode follows episode and the ebullient toad triumphs over good sense and the upstart weasels. There are lots of kids on hand to ladle on the charm, which they do with precocious effectiveness, and promising performances particularly Terrence Wilton's bluff badger and Leo Conville's shy Mole; and Carl Davis's music is great. </p> <p>It's not very taxing, and it is entirely without meaning, but if you want to spend a couple of hours with your kids in the open air on a summer afternoon entering into the pretence that you are by a riverbank, it will serve perfectly well. Just remember that this is one of those outdoor theatrical experiences where what is going on on stage plays second fiddle to the pleasant ambience and the ice cream at the interval.

  "<p>Kuwait has banned Michael Moore's anti-Bush documentary, deeming it critical of the Iraq war and insulting to Saudi Arabia's royal family.</p> <p>An information ministry official from the Arab state, which was invaded by Iraq in 1990, said it could not show a movie that was disrespectful of an allied country.</p> <p>\"We have a law that prohibits insulting friendly nations, and ties between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are special,\" Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour, cinema and production supervisor at the Kuwaiti information ministry, told Associated Press.</p> <p>He said the film \"insulted the Saudi royal family by saying they had common interests with the Bush family and that those interests contradicted the interests of the American people\".</p> <p>Dastour also says that the film criticised the US's Iraq invasion: \"This was tantamount to criticising Kuwait for [what it did] to liberate Iraq.\" </p> <p>\"The movie made Iraq look like a paradise whose problems started with the American invasion,\" Dastour said. \"It would have angered Kuwaitis.\" </p> <p>The movie was banned last month when the only cinema company in Kuwait, which is state-owned, was turned down for a licence to show the movie. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Saudi ambassador to Britain, Prince Turki al-Faisal, labelled Moore's movie \"grossly unfair\" in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.

  "Peter Lewis arrived in Enfield in February as the council's director of education and leisure services, since when his feet have barely touched the ground. <p>He has visited 47 schools out of the borough's 82 (and plans to see them all by October), seven libraries, four leisure centres and a children's home - all on top of a hectic daytime job. </p> <p>On each visit he has taken his digital camera: \"The idea was to help me remember each place so that they weren't a complete blur,\" he admits. \"But I have been particularly impressed with the standard and quality of artwork in the schools. The kids are doing a lot they deserve to feel really proud of.\" </p> <p>Mr Lewis is working on what he sees as his main priority - the huge task of reorganising the work of the council so that it is more \"joined up\" and, crucially, reflects the government's new agenda, with its emphasis on children's services as an integral part of education. </p> <p>He wants to break down the barriers between the different departments and encourage more openness, with staff encouraged to reflect not just on their work but also on how they com municate with each other, headteachers, teachers, parents and other users. To this end, he has launched a consultation with staff. </p> <p>Crucially, Mr Lewis is determined to change a culture of \"low aspirations\" within some sectors of the local community and to tackle the knock-on effects of a high population turnover. \"Mobility is a big issue here in Enfield,\" he says. \"Related to that is growing numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, who have to be accommodated and are entitled to get follow-up services. We are facing an \u00a3800,000 bill for that.\" </p> <p>Mr Lewis, a native of north Staffordshire and formerly director of education and leisure services at Southampton, has moved to an authority which has made great strides in education, acknowledged in a positive Ofsted report published early last year. He describes the job as \"perfect\" for him because of his background - as a teacher, social worker and foster carer. </p> <p>Recruitment of social workers and teachers remains a priority, he said, and he has been talking to Middlesex University about building a core skills module into training appropriate for both jobs.</p>",
  "Prosecutors investigating the kidnapping and murder of a prominent Mexican doctor who was named woman of the year in 1997 have arrested a former policeman and a private security guard employed to patrol the Mexico City street where she lived. <p>In videotaped confessions shown to reporters, the former policeman, Noe Hiniestra, told how he and his gang intercepted Carmen Gutierrez as she drove to work on July 22. He said that despite reaching a ransom agreement with her husband, they decided to kill Mrs Gutierrez two days later, because \"we got nervous\". </p> <p>Her body was found dumped in a sewage canal on the eastern outskirts of the capital, but the crime was not made public for almost a week, when it caused an outrage. </p> <p>There is growing pressure on Mexico's local and federal governments to reduce violent crime, particularly kidnapping, which began to cause concern a decade ago and now appears to be out of control. </p> <p>A month ago hundreds of thousands of people marched through central Mexico City to demand an end to the phenomenon, which terrifies Mexican families from the middle class upwards. </p> <p>International security companies estimate that there are 3,000 kidnappings a year in Mexico. The official total is about 500. </p> <p>Many families do not report kidnappings for fear that corrupt elements in the police are colluding with criminal gangs. </p> <p>Distrust of the police leads many Mexicans to employ private security guards to watch over their families or their neighbourhoods. </p> <p>The Gutierrez case suggests that these guards are not necessarily any more trustworthy than the police. </p> <p>Mrs Gutierrez's colleagues at the hospital where she worked demanded harder efforts to to find her killers and an end to the impunity with which kidnappers seem to operate. </p> <p>Mrs Gutierrez, a graduate of Mexico's National Autonomous University, had done postgraduate work in London. </p> <p>The Mexican president, Vicente Fox, sent his personal condolences to her family. </p> <p>\"The loss of a woman like her, who had dedicated her life to doing good for others, is an insult to our entire society, and an irreparable loss,\" he wrote. </p> <p>The capital's police chief, Marcelo Ebrard, set up a special investigation squad, which led to the arrests within hours. </p> <p>Mr Ebrard said fingerprints on the doctor's abandoned car were traced to the former policeman, who was dismissed from the force four years ago for unspecified \"bad conduct\". </p> <p>Mr Hiniestra allegedly acted with his uncle, who was employed by Mrs Gutierrez's family and their neighbours to guard their street. A third suspect worked as a gardener. </p> <p>The gang were reportedly arrested in possession of the victim's car and house keys, her watch and her jewellery. The police said they were on the trail of at least one more member of the gang, a taxi driver called David. </p> <p>Mexican newspapers reported that the security guard's girlfriend, who worked as a maid in Mrs Gutierrez's house, had been released after questioning. </p> <p>The attorney general's office told the Associated Press on Saturday that it was also investigating the participation of a Colombian security company which Mrs Gutierrez's family hired to help them negotiate with the kidnappers. </p> <p>Earlier this year the attorney general blamed such firms for exacerbating the problem by discouraging victims from going to the police, whom he insisted were getting cleaner. </p> <p>According to Mr Hiniestra's taped confession, the gang first asked for 2m pesos, about \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>In frantic negotiations over two days the demand rapidly fell until a ransom of 163,000 pesos was agreed. </p> <p>But the alleged kidnapper said he had become jumpy because of noise on the line the last time he talked to Mrs Gutierrez's husband, so the gang decided to kill the doctor. </p> <p>\"We walked her down to the [sewage] canal, and then Eliazar [another suspect] put a rope around her neck and began strangling her,\" Mr Hiniestra said on the tape. </p> <p>\"We let go of her, and threw her in the canal, but she didn't die, so we went down and we held her under the surface until she stopped breathing. </p> <p>\"Then we each went our separate way.\"</p>",
  "The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, received the strongest challenge yet from a protege when Mohammad Dahlan, a former interior minister, accused him of squandering $5bn (\u00a32.74) and \"sitting on the corpses\" of Palestinians. <p>He said that if Mr Arafat did not begin to reform the Palestinian Authority there would be massive demonstrations on August 10 in Gaza City. </p> <p>In an interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Watan he said: \"Arafat is sitting on the corpses and destruction of the Palestinians at a time when they're desperately in need of a new mentality.\" </p> <p>All of the funds which foreign countries had donated to the Palestinian Authority, a total of $5bn \"have gone down the drain, and we don't know to where,\" he added. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's policies had brought about a situation in which Palestinian lives were in ruins. \"The Palestinian situation is not putting up with any more corruption, and there is no escape aside from reforms that Arafat himself has authorised,\" Mr Dahlan said. </p> <p>He is rumoured to have instigated a series of incidents against Gaza security chiefs appointed by Mr Arafat and accused of corruption. But this is the first time he has publicly attacked the leader and placed himself at the head of an emerging reform movement. </p> <p>Mr Dahlan, 43, has broad support in the Gaza Strip and is respected by Israel and the United States. Like all critics of Mr Arafat, he believes it is vital that he should remain leader of the Palestinians but more efficient managers should handle Palestinian affairs. </p> <p>Israel's proposal to withdraw from settlements in the Gaza Strip has created a sense of urgency about reforming the authority and removing a generation of bureaucrats appointed by Mr Arafat and seen as corrupt and incompetent. </p> <p>Yesterday gunmen loyal to Mr Arafat broke up a conference attended by Palestinian legislators in Ramallah, saying the meeting was part of a conspiracy against him. </p> <p>Seventy members of Fatah, Mr Arafat's faction, were meeting to discuss reform and growing anarchy in the Palestinian territories when the 20 men burst in and fired into the ceiling. </p> <p>The meeting was ended, but not before a letter was drafted to Mr Arafat denouncing the lawlessness and corruption in the authority. </p> <p>\"President Arafat, this may be the last chance for reforming our situation before reaching the end. We need a revolution within our Fatah movement,\" it said. </p> <p>Last month militants kidnapped Ghazi Jabali, the chief of police, and demanded his dismissal. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's proposed replacement, his relative Moussa Arafat, was seen as even more corrupt and he was forced to withdraw the appointment. </p> <p>The kidnapping was the first sign of an emerging confrontation between Mr Arafat's old guard and reformist politicians and militants who are determined that the authority should become democratic. </p> <p>Since Mr Arafat returned to the Palestinian territories in 1994 he has been accused of presiding over an almost feudal regime in which his appointees grow rich on public funds in return for their loyalty. </p> <p>Since Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, proposed withdrawing from the Gaza settlements, Palestinian lead ers appear to have had no strategy to improve the position of their people. </p> <p>In recent months Mr Dahlan has been tentatively setting out a platform on which to oppose Mr Arafat. </p> <p>In a succession of interviews he has said that the Palestinians must choose whether they want war or peace with Israel. War has clearly failed, he says, leaving peace as the only viable option. </p> <p>In contrast to Mr Arafat's strategy of ambiguity, condemning violence but doing nothing to stop it, Mr Dahlan said the authority should pre vent attacks on Israel for its own sake. </p> <p>Last week Ahmed Qureia, the Palestinian prime minister, retracted his resignation after Mr Arafat agreed to a series of reforms. But he has made such promises before and then been reluctant to allow the dismantling of his power structure. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Israeli troops opened fire in a Gaza Strip refugee camp early today, killing a 60-year-old woman and wounding four other Palestinians, witnesses said.</p>"
