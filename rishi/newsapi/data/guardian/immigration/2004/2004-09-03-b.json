  "<p>The Amazon rainforest and savanna lands are being destroyed at a rate of 1.2m hectares (3m acres) a year to feed Europe's insatiable desire for more soya bean production, according to a research report yesterday. </p> <p>The UK is one of the chief customers for South American soya production, and the report says that by 2020 an area the size of Britain will have been converted to grow the beans as the market grows by 60%. </p> <p>Soya oil appears in hundreds of processed foods such as ice cream, margarines, mayonnaise and lipsticks, but the biggest market is to feed farm animals. Adam Harrison, rural development officer for WWF Scotland, said: \"The market has grown because feeding cattle animal protein was banned following the BSE crisis, and soya is the high protein substitute.\" </p> <p>The report says that soya production has led to vast tracts of land being cleared in southern Brazil, and the near-disappearance of Brazil's Atlantic rainforest. It says damage could be greatly reduced and production increased by alternating the growing of soya with cattle ranching, which improves the soil and increases yields of soya and from the cattle. </p> <p>Mr Harrison said: \"Our report concludes that fairly simple changes in farming methods can save a lot of virgin land and have environmental and economic benefits.\"</p>",
  "The home secretary's commitment to end the routine use of prison to hold immigration detainees has been honoured and the practice ended in January 2002 (Asylum seekers still held in jail, September 1). It was made clear that exceptions would have to be made for reasons of security and control, ie an individual's behaviour posing a threat to the running of the centre. <p>The emergency requirement to transfer detainees from Harmondsworth was clearly an exceptional situation, brought about by the actions of the detainees in forcing the closure of Harmondsworth. Most will be moved back to the immigration removal estate. Those moved from Harmondsworth include failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders. Most will have been found to have no legal right to remain. There is no reason why an immigration detainee cannot be removed from the UK direct from a prison.<br><b>Des Browne MP</b><br>Immigration minister</p>",

  "When they come to write the history of early 21st century Beijing, it will probably not even merit a footnote, but last Thursday was a big day in the life of Cui Zengxu, the cycling barber. <p>After more than 40 years of clipping, cropping and trimming, the 75-year-old gave a final haircut on one of his prime spots: Jiaokou, the muddy, bumpy, anachronistic dirt-track that serves as the northern border of Chaoyang Park. </p> <p>Next week, that road will cease to exist and the last of his customers in the neighbourhood will have been moved out so that the land can be prepared for the least indigenous of Beijing's Olympic sports: beach volleyball. </p> <p>Jiaokou has always been one of Beijing's least salubrious areas. But now it is a wrecking zone. Streets of debris form the backdrop for Mr Cui's mobile, open-air salon. The few buildings left have \"chai\" (demolish) signs daubed on the walls. A nearby pond has been filled with rubbish. A plaster statue of a woman sits amid a row of smashed houses and gutted karaoke bars. </p> <p>Mr Cui appears to be cutting hair in a wasteland, but it does not seem to faze him. Although it is the last of countless fortnightly visits to the Jiaokou community, he pedals up as usual with a bag full of brushes, razors, clippers and mirrors, unfolds the chair that is his place of work and patiently waits for clients, who pay the equivalent of 20p for a 30-minute trim, regardless of age or style. </p> <p>There is not much time for nostalgia in Beijing, arguably the fastest changing city on earth. From experience, Mr Cui knows it is better simply to move with the times. </p> <p>He has seen fashions come and go. During the insanity of the cultural revolution, customers asked for half of their heads to be shaved. After that traumatic era, people preferred a steady short-back-and-sides. Since China opened up, his clients are more picky, requesting a variety of styles. </p> <p>But Mr Cui appears to have his own ideas. I've never seen any of his customers escape with anything less than a military crop. His last three customers - a small boy, a migrant worker and me - all left with the same style, no matter what request we gave to begin with. </p> <p>\"I know you said you like a bit of a quiff in the front,\" he said. \"But while I was cutting your hair, I realised it didn't look good, so I've done it all the same. It's a big improvement, don't you think?\" </p> <p>It was too late to grumble. In any case, a complaint would not have gone down well. Mr Cui is from a generation that endured the murderous famines of the \"great leap forward\", when much of Jiaokou was still farmland, and the anarchy of the cultural revolution, when this beautiful area was polluted by pharmaceutical plants, paper mills and a shooting range of the People's Liberation Army. </p> <p>Today, it is just a dirty tip as far as most Beijingers are concerned. Taxi drivers would rather endure the thick traffic of the fourth ring road than risk their suspension and their bodywork on the muddy, bumpy road. </p> <p>But all this will change in the next three months. Chaoyang Park is spreading north as part of the city's beautification campaign for the 2008 Olympics. The grey hovels that were home to Mr Cui's clients will be replaced by green parkland, the dusty roads will become a sandy sporting venue. </p> <p>Locals may grumble that they are being moved against their will into soulless high-rise blocks, but Mr Cui has a hairdresser's philosophy. Even if things don't turn out as you like, don't worry: it will grow back again. He is ready to move on. </p> <p>\"I'll find somewhere different to cut hair,\" he says. \"There are always people who need a trim.\"</p>",
  "<p>When a 19-year-old Jennifer Beals was picked from 4,000 hopefuls to star as the welder-by-day/dancer-by-night in the 1983 smash hit Flashdance, the research wasn't too hard. She took some dance classes, she tried on some legwarmers, that kind of thing. Researching her current role was a much taller order.</p> <p>\"I thought there must be some secret to being a lesbian,\" she says down a crackly phone from her trailer in Vancouver, where she is already filming the second series of The L Word, dubbed \"the lesbian Sex And The City\". \"I thought the secret might be on the internet or something ...\"</p> <p>The secret turned out to revolve around a pair of leather trousers. \"This woman I was working with, she had this really cool pair of leather pants and I wanted them. She said I could have them if I went out with her to some dyke bars and I was like 'sure' ...\"</p> <p>Beals was kind of disappointed though by her big night out. \"We went to this New York club and there were girls on podiums, dancing and stuff, but it wasn't so different from any other place.\"</p> <p>She can't remember the exact name of the club. \"Pussy something? Clit? Labia?\"</p> <p>There are some yelps in the background from the bunch of real-life Ls congregated in my flat where I'm throwing an L Word party, although it isn't like TV version. Everything is glamorous in The L Word, where the gal pals congregate in a bar similar to Central Perk in Friends, and everyone is cute and shiny and drinks skinny lattes and has plenty of money and is not a psychopath, and I want to know where this place is. I tell her that most lesbian gatherings involve women in advanced stages of alcohol poisoning with loo-brush hairdos and flat shoes slipping around on soggy cigarette butts in bars where they think you're trying to be posh if you ask for ice in your drink.</p> <p>\"Well ...\" Beals hesitates. \"I guess it does take place in LA ...\"</p> <p>In many ways, of course, The L Word is a complete disgrace. In the first episode of Queer As Folk you got gay-boy sex within the first five minutes. Here, as well as lots of Ls, you also have lots of Ss (straights) and Bs (bisexuals) and the first show centres on a bi-try, played by Mia Kirshner, spying through the hedge of her LA home on two hot chicks making out in the pool next door (great scene), but then we immediately go into an overly-long sex scene between Kirshner and her boyfriend.</p> <p>Still, dykes are used to men trying to get in on the act. After a while you just ignore them and try and look at the bigger picture. And personally, I don't think The L Word's candy coat matters too much. Pushing lesbianism to the mainstream is all about Trojan horses, ie strategy. Dress up lesbianism in Victorian boots and corsets (see Tipping The Velvet) and you get primetime space on the BBC. Make the chicks in The L Word shave their legs and have some sensitive men hanging around and you can get yourself a second series. Once your horse has slipped through the paddock doors of \"the men upstairs\", ie the TV bods who decide what constitutes contemporary culture, then you can ask why non-airbrushed chicks are unacceptable - and, naturally, that's not only a lesbian issue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in my flat, the real-life Ls are baying for blood. \"Ask her if she did it with a woman yet!\" Lauren, the hard-drinking pilot from Ohio, demands. \"Ask her about the off-the-shoulder sweatshirt in Flashdance!\" Alison, the chef from Crystal Palace, slurs.</p> <p>Lesbians like sexy, bolshy underdogs and some of those Flashdance scenes have proved seminal: the dramatic removal of the welding helmet to reveal a frisky mane of hair, the stripper dance involving water poured over a hot sweaty body (copied by J-Lo in her I'm Glad video), the audition scene (the basis for Geri Halliwell's It's Raining Men video) where the feisty Beals dances for her life in front of a row of stern judges - including the repressed lesbian librarian type.</p> <p>Beals is happy to talk about pussy but gets waspish when you mention Flashdance. This slight prissiness comes over in her role as Bette, the hard-nosed, Saab-convertible-driving art dealer trying to be supportive to her long-term girlfriend, who's attempting to get pregnant by turkey baster. But then, Beals obviously thinks hard about things: after the phenomenal success of Flashdance she turned her back on Hollywood and went to Yale to read American literature. Her recent movies - Roger Dodger (2002) and The Anniversary Party (2001) - are independent productions where she plays, respectively, a feisty modern rock chick and an amateur photographer. She asserts that she accepted the The L Word role because \"the show will change the way people look at each other\".</p> <p>Beals, born in Chicago to an Irish-American mother and African-American father, might like playing bolshy characters (she has \"a fantasy about playing Buffy\"), but fundamentally she's a good girl. When asked if she prefers snogging men or women actors she fudges that \"it's not about gender, it's about trusting the other person\". She says, though, that women are more thoughtful in TV bed situations. \"Another woman can be good at hiding bits of your body for the camera. I mean if you've got a bunch of cellulite ...\"</p> <p>She is a bunch of contradictions. She talks about her cellulite yet insists she would never have plastic surgery because \"you rob yourself of the evidence of experience\". Also, anti-materialistic and un-LA though she claims to be (she talks a lot about running round in flip-flops in the 500 miles of \"wilderness\" in her LA desert home and for her recent 40th birthday she went horse-trekking with her second husband Ken through Patagonia), she still insisted on a (very La-La) no-nudity clause in her contract. She reckons her sex scenes are \"so hot\" that you won't even notice she's still clothed.</p> <p>Hot she may be, but the hottest of all is Katherine Moennig, who is utterly convincing as Shane, the tomboy stud muffin hairdresser (although the only out lesbian member of the cast is kd lang's ex, Leisha Hailey, who plays the bisexual journalist). One of my favourite things about The L Word is that its fantasy feel makes you feel relaxed and safe. Here, you can sleep with a guy if you want and not get excommunicated for it; you can have long hair and lipstick if you want; you can be a lesbian who wants to have babies and not be portrayed as a complete dullard.</p> <p>Unadulterated heterosexuality is the thing that looks dull these days and maybe that's why Beals can't resist telling her Shane story. \"I was in an elevator with Ken on the first day of shooting and in walks this amazing, crazy thing ...\" (Her voice has much richer tones than when she was talking about the horse-riding with Ken just now). \"And she puts out her hand and gives me this salutation ... kind of this Elvis vibe. It was so ... unbelievably cool.\" She adds, her voice growing perkier, that for the first two weeks of shooting, Shane made her feel like \"the most uncool person\".</p> <p>The Lesbian Avengers used to have a T-shirt motto that went, \"We Recruit\" and it will be interesting to see how much recruiting The L Word pulls off. That nervous flutter in Beals' voice sounds like a good start.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The L Word, Wed, 10pm, Living</p>",
  "<p>On September 11 2001, one reaction above all others became cliche almost before the twin towers had completed their grotesque descent. It was, people said, like something out of a movie. And they were right. We'd all seen American landmarks demolished before - flying saucers zapping the White House in Independence Day, meteorites knocking lumps out of New York in Armageddon - but this time, the drama on our screens, while scarcely any more believable, was actually happening. A gang of Allah-addled yahoos, armed with implements most of us could find in our kitchen drawers, really had perpetrated an assault on the United States as deadly and traumatic as Pearl Harbour. It was hardly the most pressing concern raised by that awful day, but for a while it seemed that, surely, nobody would ever again make apocalyptic blockbusters of the Independence Day or Armageddon ilk; Arnold Schwarzenegger's Collateral Damage was tactfully iced because the plot involved terrorists. It even appeared vaguely possible that there would be no more nauseating romantic comedies set in New York, hitherto the world capital of nauseating romantic comedies. The John Cusack/Kate Beckinsale bucket-filler Serendipity was hastily edited to excise shots of the World Trade Centre, as were Zoolander and People I Know.</p> <p>We were at war, we were told, and societies at war do not generally entertain themselves by scaring themselves further. People who endured the Blitz did not spend their leisure time watching films about British cities being bombed from the air. Any Sarajevo cinema proprietor who spent the mid-1990s screening films about civilians being slaughtered by genocidal hillbillies would have struggled for custom. Those members of the tinfoil-hat tendency who believe that the world is in imminent danger of invasion by little green men or annihilation by rogue meteorites would not have much appreciated Independence Day or Armageddon. But we are making, and watching, films and television dramas about terrorism and terrorists.</p> <p>Our enthusiastic consumption of these is, surely, an indication that we don't really take the threat they depict any more seriously than we do, say, the threat of being massacred with a chainsaw in Texas. The war on terror, launched three years ago this month by George W Bush in the ruins of downtown Manhattan, has swiftly become a staple of popular entertainment. It is difficult, on balance, not to conclude that we're all rather enjoying it.</p> <p>The Grid, the latest contribution to the genre of post-9/11 drama is, first and foremost, fantastically good television. Set in the near future, its compelling set-up pits a task force of British and American intelligence officers against a cell of Saudi, Egyptian and Chechen terrorists. The dialogue is sharp, with the minimum of the Janet-and-John exposition often inserted into current affairs-based dramas. It offers intriguing nuance, presenting conflicts within the opposing teams (the CIA, FBI and NSC squabble with each other, and with their British counterparts), and within the characters (one of the CIA guys is a Muslim of Arab descent, one of the Islamist terrorists a first-generation US citizen). The performances are terrific, notably Jemma Redgrave as an MI6 officer, as cold and hard as an ice pick, and Silas Carson as an Egyptian doctor-activist torn between urges to save life and take it. There are a couple of startling but plausible plot twists. There are quite a few explosions. Aside from its subscription to the ironclad casting law of transatlantic co-productions - that all Americans look like Julianna Margulies and Dylan McDermott, and most Brits look like unmade beds with tea-stained moustaches - The Grid is great stuff.</p> <p>What The Grid is not, however, is what its press release describes as \"a unique look at the world's gravest threat\". It is barely possible to turn on a television or walk into a cinema without being asked to digest yet another fictional or semi-fictional or info-taining insight into the war on terror, either explicitly (Michael Moore's fatuous rant Fahrenheit 9/11, last week's Channel 4 drama The Hamburg Cell) or implicitly (this week's BBC simulation Crisis Command, bio-terror shocker Smallpox 2002, the Panorama that mocked up reports of terrorist strikes on London, 24, The West Wing, Spooks, David Mamet's recent Spartan, the 2002 film of Tom Clancy's potboiler The Sum Of All Fears, in which Baltimore gets obliterated by a terrorist nuke). This is to say nothing of the dozens of similarly inspired theatrical productions, including Guantanamo: Honour Bound To Defend Freedom, David Hare's Stuff Happens and the National Theatre's (brilliant) remake of Henry V as a Gulf War II drama. We're eating this stuff up with mustard. A distant war, a vague threat, are as intoxicating for the viewing public as they are for the politician who gets to play at statesman, for the journalist who gets to write pompous articles claiming to know any better than anyone else. It makes us all feel like we live in important times, and are therefore ourselves important.</p> <p>The great unsayable truth of the war on terror, demonstrated by this spectacular eruption of post-9/11 entertainment, is that the chance of anything we're watching at the movies or on TV happening in our streets is, while certainly extant, small. Shocking though the tolls of New York, Bali, Madrid and others have been, our chances of being the victim of a terrorist attack are, on a day-to-day basis, approximately the same as our chances of being kicked to death by a llama in a top hat. Apologies if, in between this piece being written and being printed, Oxford Circus tube is choked by sarin, or if anyone in Britain is kicked to death by an unusually well-dressed South American ruminant, but it wouldn't alter the actuarial reality: terrorism is not that big a risk.</p> <p>This might be partly thanks to the work of the heroes of The Grid - the intelligence agencies who, claimed Australian Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock at a conference last month, have foiled more than 100 terrorist attacks since 9/11. However, it's impossible to know how true this is. Mr Ruddock represents a government which, like Britain's, took its country to war on the premise that Iraq possessed a fearsome arsenal of intercontinental megadeath, the fuses of which were perilously close to the glowing end of Saddam Hussein's cigar - as lurid a fiction as anything dreamt up by the makers of 24.</p> <p>It's much more likely, though, that our readiness to be amused by depictions of people plotting to destroy all that we hold dear is due to a general belief that the threat posed by Osama bin Laden's franchise of obscurantist crackpots has been somewhat overstated by our government and media. It is a reasonable conclusion to have reached. Our skies have not rained aeroplanes. British cities have not become re-runs of Beirut in the 1980s, or even of British cities in the 1980s. The much-feared \"Arab street\" has remained an entirely genial thoroughfare upon which the likeliest hazards for the visiting westerner are being roundly trounced at backgammon or overdosing on coffee poured by rug merchants. The victims of terrorism, though each a crime and a tragedy, represent a fraction of the toll claimed by conventional wars, preventable disease, drunk drivers. The fact that programmes like The Grid are being made should cheer us up on two levels. One, that we've got something this good to watch. Two, the very fact that The Grid, and others like it, all designed at least in part to terrify, are being made, and shown, at all. The time to start worrying is when our screens are suddenly filled with reassurances.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Grid, Tue-Thu, 9pm, BBC2</p>",
  "Children make it different. Like the tragedies of Columbine and Dunblane, the terror that stalks the classrooms of besieged Middle School 1 in Beslan, North Ossetia, is uniquely disturbing. <p>Who in these torrid days of random, global violence has not become accustomed, even inured, to the suicide bombings in Iraq or a host of other troublespots? Yet who, anywhere in the world, is not touched, angered or frightened - or all three - by the thought of young kids traumatised by masked killers wearing bomb-belts? </p> <p>When the victims are children, the sort of horror on show in Beslan, real or threatened, represents the adult world's ultimate betrayal of innocence, its final failure to nurture and protect. Here is a shared disgrace, borne of a universal grief. Here is an international crying shame, beseeching an urgent remedy. </p> <p>The Chechen conflict, in which the Ossetian siege is inextricably bound up, has become internationalised in many other ways since it reignited, in its modern incarnation, in the early 1990s. Like Czechoslovakia in a different time, the Caucasian lands of Chechnya, North and South Ossetia, Ingushetia and Dagestan cannot be dismissed as distant countries of which we know little and care less. What happens there matters here. </p> <p>\"Their suffering is our suffering,\" Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, said yesterday. \"The awesome responsibility of President Putin and his government is our responsibility, too.\" </p> <p>The mere fact of non-stop international media coverage makes Beslan school a shared reality around the world. The inescapable fact that the Chechen conflict once again pits Muslim peoples against Christians or plain non-believers, setting \"Islam\" against the \"west\", sounds an only too familiar post-9/11 global echo. </p> <p>Putin pins the blame for the escalating crisis, perhaps the gravest of his presidency, not on home-grown Chechen fighters but, primarily, on an international Islamist conspiracy linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>The evidence for his contention is thin and often contradictory. But one thing is undoubtedly true. Since plunging recklessly back into Chechnya in 1994, Putin, his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and the once proud Red Army have caused such untold misery, such rank injustice, such fury and despair that, like the Americans in Iraq, they created a breeding ground and magnet for the religious extremists they struggle to extirpate. </p> <p>In effect, it was Russian generals and their turncoat allies who internationalised a war that should never have begun and which could have been peaceably resolved long ago. For this foolishness, Russia's conscript soldiers still pay a terrible price. </p> <p>The risk of a spreading, regional conflagration grows with every outrage, every unanswered act of blood - and with every broken child. Since the time of the tsars, the mountain tribes of the Caucasus have fought for land, faith and just for the hell of it. In A Hero Of Our Time, novelist Mikhail Lermontov wrote admiringly in 1840 of the bravery of his opponents along Russia's lawless southern flank. </p> <p>But now Caucasian instability threatens ever more broadly. Neighbouring Georgia, home to last November's \"rose revolution\", is no model of stability. And by coincidence, the Beslan siege has forced the postponement of a presidential visit to Turkey, Russia's historic Ottoman rival. Putin wants to build up trade and other links. But primarily, he needs Turkey as a southern bulwark of stability and security in a region sliding dangerously beyond Moscow's control. </p> <p>Ten long years of destructive, on-off conflict, egregious human rights abuses, massive refugee displacements and blatant flouting of international law have also rendered Chechnya a matter of undeniable international concern. Organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the OSCE have kept a brave and faithful tally of the human toll and political cost of Russia's heedless policy. Again and again, campaigners have lobbied western governments to draw a diplomatic line, to sponsor a political process, to honestly recognise Chechnya for what it ever more evidently is - a threat to international peace and security, as defined by the UN. Again and again, those same governments, including Britain's, have mostly preferred to look the other way. </p> <p>When Tony Blair talks of Britain's \"moral responsibility\" in Darfur and Iraq; when he speaks, as most famously in Chicago in 1999, of the criteria for intervention; when he sends troops dashing off to Kabul and Freetown, where in all this is there a thought for Chechnya? Ten years of conflict, tens of thousands dead and no end remotely in sight. </p> <p>When Straw yesterday spoke of the \"expanded range of issues\" on which the UN will now consider the use of outside force under chapter VII - including \"the overthrow of democratically elected government, terrorism, large-scale human rights violations, humanitarian catastrophe (and) refugee crises\" - can he credibly exclude Chechnya which, in truth, arguably qualifies in all categories? </p> <p>Russia has always maintained that the Chechen conflict is an internal matter, to be resolved internally. But now that Putin, by asking for international support, has for the first time effectively invited the security council to consider the issue, western leaders have a clear choice. </p> <p>Britain and others can hide behind the pretence that, as Putin maintains, violence in the Caucasus is just another front in the US-led \"war on terror\" - and close their eyes to causes and remedies. They can give Putin what he wants, which is carte blanche to do whatever he deems necessary. Or they can find the courage to change the habit of the past decade. They can dispense with the sort of mealy-mouthed, turpitudinous shuffling-about indulged in by France's Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at their recent meeting with Putin. And they can insist instead that in return for active western support, Russia must finally accept the obvious: that Chechnya is a pressing, international problem requiring an agreed, collective, non-violent, international response. </p> <p>Is it so absurd to suggest that EU troops, or even forces organised through Nato, be deployed under a UN peacekeeping mandate? Is it practically impossible to set in train some form of externally mediated peace dialogue, currently absent? </p> <p>Chechnya offers a key test of how, if at all, new, much-discussed post-Iraq rules governing future humanitarian and security interventions can be made to work. Certainly Chechnya is a devilish hard case to crack. Certainly it would be a fraught undertaking. But it is surely worth it - if only for the sake of the children. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.tisdall@theguardian.com\">s.tisdall@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Gene Hackman was a good sheriff. OK, a little heavy-handed, but he doesn't deserve a gutful of blood. Or Clint Eastwood looming over him with a gun, ready to unload the other barrel.\" Howe Gelb, the singer-songwriter behind Giant Sand, is talking about the film Unforgiven. Eastwood is one of his heroes; so is Thelonious Monk. \"But as Clint says,\" - Gelb narrows his eyes and spits through his teeth - \"'Deserve's got nothing to do with it.'\" He slurps the top half-inch of ice out of his glass (\"Mojito: ice, rum, fresh mint, the perfect summer drink\") and raises an eyebrow. </p> <p>The moral of the story is pretty clear. What's less clear is if Gelb is on the side of the tormented gunman or the decent guy who has done the best job he could and is bleeding to death. Probably both. \"There's a bullet out there for each one of us,\" Gelb smiles. Right on cue the speaker in the hotel bar, previously silent, starts blaring out, in all its cheery horror, Let the Sunshine In. </p> <p>Conversation turns to gravity, manic mood-swings, Mott the Hoople, President Clinton, and peyote (this last one a poignant tale involving a banjo, an older woman, a van festooned with Christmas lights, Memphis, a chemically altered McDonald's chocolate milkshake, Furry Lewis and A Star Is Born). </p> <p>In fine Howe Gelb fashion, none of this has a jot to do with the record he's ostensibly in London to promote, which is It's All Over the Map, the new album of alt-country band Giant Sand. As opposed to the solo Gelb album, which Giant Sand's website is currently plugging; or the piano album Gelb released just a few months back; or the Band of Blacky Ranchette album Gelb recorded and released shortly before that; or the gospel choir album - \"not religious songs or God songs, just the spirit of the spirit, the overwhelming sound of the human voice\" - that he has just finished recording in Ottawa and which is ready for release at any time (though under what name it will appear is still undecided). </p> <p>Gelb's discography is of a length and breadth that would have all but the most committed fan whining quietly. Fortunately, Gelb/Giant Sand fans are committed - and the website has an offer: buy three albums and get one free. Not the usual approach to the music business, but then Gelb's take on both music and business has always been quixotic: decidedly tilted and unswervingly idealistic. The records he makes, in whatever incarnation and with whatever musicians, are equal parts dazzling, intriguing, beautiful, maddening, musical and perverse. V2, the major label that signed Giant Sand in 1996, employed two different words, however: \"Too indie\". The label dropped the band before releasing so much as one album. </p> <p>\"They said that the album we gave them [Chore of Enchantment] wasn't commercial. But there are enough people out there doing 'commercial' far better than I ever could, so why would they want us for that? Then four years later, a song from that album was used in a Coke ad, so suddenly it's so commercial it is a commercial.\" Gelb shakes his head in amazement. Particularly since the song the advertisers used, Shiver, was the first one he wrote after the death by brain cancer in 1997 of his best friend and former bandmate Rainer Ptacek - \"recorded, in fact, in the same studio that I'd been recording with Rainer in a few days before\". </p> <p>Though he denies any involvement in getting the ad, Gelb admits it was a \"blessing in disguise\". The band's brief major label experience had left him \"completely broke - because when you're on a major you can't do anything else, you can't record or put anything out\". On a positive note, it did give him the impetus to form his own record label, Ow Om. Among its releases, which are sold via the website, are any Gelb, Giant Sand and associated albums that Thrill Jockey (the US indie they normally go through) choose to pass on, official bootlegs, the odd \"cool\" unsigned band Gelb and associates like, or friends lacking a US record deal. </p> <p>Gelb, who has just slotted some sessions with Grandaddy into his busy schedule, is always collaborating with someone on something. He says it's because he likes \"nothing better than to be just another player in a band\". An \"extremely reluctant front-person\", he rhapsodises about how much more agreeable it was being \"just the keyboard player\" in his first band, back in 1978. Following a move from Pennsylvania, where Gelb was born and raised, to Tucson, Arizona, where he still lives, Gelb formed a band with Ptacek in 1979. \"He was the main guy. When he left, we had to divide up the chores and this is what I got. That took some getting used to.\" </p> <p>Gelb's way of dealing with it was to treat Giant Sand (not to be confused with his 1970s electro-rock band Giant Sandworms) as a loose, uncompetitive, mutually supportive musical collective, a place for friends to hang out and play. \"I just liked the idea of having this kind of removed world, this brotherhood - the idea of a band being something more than a front person or dealing with the throes of fame. Because survival is better than success. It hones the instinct.\" </p> <p>For almost two decades, his system seemed to work. But in recent years - in fact since Ptacek's death from brain cancer in 1997 - cracks started to appear in a corner of Giant Sand, and a more competitive, success-oriented spirit started to seep in. This corner was occupied by Giant Sand rhythm section John Convertino and Joey Burns. Or to be precise, ex-rhythm section: they do not appear on It's All Over the Map. </p> <p>Like Gelb, Burns and Convertino also engaged in numerous outside projects, but it was one side-band in particular - Calexico, now more widely known than Giant Sand - that caused the rift. Not because of its success, Gelb suggests, but because the ambition and competitiveness that got Calexico there are antithetical to his concept of what a band should be. </p> <p>\"There was a time a few years ago where the affiliations with Calexico actually began to work against Giant Sand and eat away at what the band was. It was really bizarre - we had people associated only with their label, their agency, people who had no interest in Giant Sand, only Calexico ... \" The sentence drifts off. \"A lot of people confuse Giant Sand with John and Joe, and maybe I'm the only guy on the planet that doesn't know those two guys as being joined at the hip. I met John years before I met Joe and then found Joe and brought him in and then things developed and then I dragged them both back to Tucson where they tripped on to the sound that became celebrated ... I really love those guys a lot, and they were great days, so the separation I think may be felt more by me than them. But, for whatever reason, it was time to let things go, time to reinvent, recognise when the amount of toxin is too great, exorcise the demons and get rid of them and celebrate the time you had. It's all evolution.\" </p> <p>Which, Gelb says, brings us to It's All Over the Map. Like his last solo album, and as the title suggests, it was made in various locations across the globe - in particular, Denmark, where Gelb's wife Sofie is from, and where the couple and their children spend the summer. Sofie sings backing vocals on the album, Howe's daughter from his first marriage, Indiosa, sings lead on a Sex Pistols cover (Anarchy in the UK), and guest musicians include Vic Chesnutt, John Parish and Scout Niblett. </p> <p>\"This record,\" says Gelb, \"makes the point of the new membership drive for the third decade. The Chore of Enchantment record was a bit heavy - Rainer had just died, and the boys began to disappear, the inner circle crumble; that was my mid-life soggy saga and I can hear it in the record, when I dare listen to it. Cover Magazine, the next Giant Sand record, was just a party to say goodbye; it didn't start out as a cover record, but none of the new songs trusted the crinkled line-up then. Then in the middle of the tour for my solo album I started writing a bunch of songs and I realised, this band is becoming what Giant Sand ever was. And there you have it.\" He smiles. \"Actual fun is being had again.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>It's All Over the Map is out on Thrill Jockey on September 13</p>",
  "Brian Whitaker raises the argument that non-violence can bring justice to the Palestinians (Israel bombings, September 1). At every checkpoint, in every town centre, in every neighbourhood, Palestinians use non-violence. When Palestinians are ordered by Israeli soldiers to strip naked, endure torture, participate in dehumanising rituals, they do not fight back; they refuse to have their spirits broken or to comply with the inhuman demands of the occupiers. <p>The problem of apartheid was not solved using purely non-violent resistance. Mahatma Gandhi resisted an empire in its twilight. But Israel is supported almost unconditionally by the only remaining superpower. Ariel Sharon believes in a vision of Eretz Israel - a greater Israel that includes the West Bank. He has shown himself more than willing to use violence to achieve this vision.

Many people became refugees after the second world war, including 15 million Germans expelled from eastern Europe.

That seems a harsh verdict on Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin, who made huge efforts for peace and convinced most Israelis to accept a two-state solution. Barak paid for those efforts with his political career - Rabin with his life. </p> <p>Nor is it a fair characterisa tion of today's Labour leaders - whether Shimon Peres or MPs such as Ephraim Sneh or Isaac Herzog.

  "Once again, Italian scientists have excelled themselves. Surgeon Sandro Giannini managed to transplant an ankle into the shattered foot of a rally driver disabled by a crash in 1991. <p>The operation, the first of its kind in Europe, involved inserting an entire ankle joint, complete with cartilage, into the patient's foot. Barring complications, Silvano Bordon, 48, from Treviso, will soon be walking around on the ankle of a 17 year-old boy who died in a car crash.</p> <p>A similarly audacious operation at a Rome hospital last year gave an octogenarian new life by replacing his whole jaw, devoured by cancer of the mouth, with the bone of a 39 year-old man who had died of a brain haemorrhage. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Italian scientists have been reconstructing a different kind of face, using similarly ground breaking technique. Dr Federico Cesarani and his team at the Struttura Operativa Complessa di Radiodiagnostica in Asti, produced an identikit model of the face of a man who died and was mummified in Egypt 3,000 years ago.</p> <p>These scientific pioneers are just the latest in a long tradition of Italian scientific achievements. But these days, Italian pioneers like Dr Giannini are a minority of the country's best brains. Every year, thousands of graduates and scientists abandon Italy in search of well paid jobs, research grants and reasonable work contracts abroad. Many of Italy's best and youngest brains are now leading American and British research teams.</p> <p>According to a detailed 2003 report entitled \"How large is the Brain Drain from Italy\", by economists in Munich, Florence and California, the proportion of graduates among those leaving Italy quadrupled between 1990 and 1998. But the average worker in Italy had less than ten years of education to his name in 1998.</p> <p>The problem is not just Italian. Throughout Europe in recent years, governments are struggling to stop brain drain across the Atlantic. </p> <p>But where others return home as soon as they can, many of Italy's migrant brains never find a way back. Despite being a nation more attached to its familiar ways; home, the family, the pasta and the coffee, hundreds of migrant doctors, lawyers, research scientists, engineers and fashion designers find, despite excellent qualifications and experience, that once back in Italy they cannot secure a job worth their salt.</p> <p>Many complain this is because of a combination of increasingly hard economic times in Italy in recent years and a paralysing tradition of nepotism, informal working arrangements, and jobs for life and politically motivated appointments in the country's universities. Italy's comparative lack of meritocracy means that while it shares a brain-drain problem with other European economic heavyweight countries, it does not experience the \"brain exchange\" from which other countries benefit.</p> <p>Research by Leeds University, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, focused on the Italian problem, concluding in March this year that: \"It is a matter of concern that scientists need to leave Italy to advance their careers but also face reintegration problem when they return.\"</p> <p>Sonia Morano-Foadi, an Italian in the research team, explained that Italians returning home come up against the \"barone\" - the ageing professors who are allegedly the 'deal-makers', brokering jobs in Italian universities and often making scientists work for them for up to two years without pay in order to progress.</p> <p>The \"fuga di cervelli\" (brain drain) has become so serious that it is high on the Italian political agenda. But thousands of university teachers, researchers and students protested earlier this year over a planned reform of the university system that many believe would make it yet harder for young scientists to make it in Italy.</p> <p>Under pressure to cut university spending, the reform would slash the numbers of full-time paid university teaching posts, and force some to work without proper contracts or pay until they are between 40 and 45 years old.</p>",

  "He's played everything from pool hustlers to outlaws and even an egg-guzzling convict, but it's unlikely Paul Newman ever thought he would one day take centre stage as a spaghetti-drenched clown. <p>Yesterday, however, the 79-year-old Hollywood veteran abandoned his ice-cool image for a red nose, facepaint and a garish outfit as he entertained 300 sick and disabled children at Zippo's Circus in London. </p> <p>Newman's secret visit was part of his work for Newman's Own products, the not-for-profit company he set up 24 years ago to make money for charity. </p> <p>The venture has so far donated more than $150m (\u00a384m) to good causes all over the world. </p> <p>With a nod to his most famous film - Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid - Newman appeared under the name Butch Bolognese. Dressed in a green bowler hat, outsize bowtie and giant, yellow clown shoes, he delighted the crowd with a 10-minute slapstick routine. </p> <p>Newman played down his performance before going on stage. \"I'm not by inclination a clown,\" he joked. \"This will certainly end my professional career.\" Although nearing 80, Newman has not stopped making films. In 2002, he appeared in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition as a Depression-era crime boss. And he has lent his voice to Cars, an animated film about a collection of classic vehicles who set out down Route 66 in search of adventure. The film is due for release next year. </p> <p>He was also among the first celebrities to see the potential of putting his name to a food product. Newman's Own grew from the family tradition of filling old wine bottles with homemade dressing and giving them to friends as Christmas presents. </p> <p>Increasing demand for the sauces persuaded Newman and a friend that there might be a wider market for the cottage industry, so they founded Newman's Own. Within a year, the company had given away around $1m to charity. </p> <p>After the success of their simple oil and vinegar salad dressing, they diversified into everything from pasta sauces to salsas, popcorn, lemonade and steak sauce. Today their products are sold in the US, Canada, Australia, Iceland, Britain, Germany, France, Israel and Japan.</p>",
  "<p>Diageo chief executive Paul Walsh yesterday said recent price rises on Guinness, Smirnoff and Baileys in Britain and Ireland would stem declining revenues on the multinational drinks group's doorstep. </p> <p>\"I think Europe is challenging for all consumer goods companies at the moment...and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future,\" Mr Walsh said, pointing to \"sluggish\" economic growth and to a decline in recent years in the number of people reaching lawful drinking age. </p> <p>A smoking ban introduced in pubs in March has further exacerbated Diageo's problems in Ireland, where Guinness sales volumes declined 6% in the 12 months to June 30. Smirnoff and Baileys fell 4% and 12% respectively. </p> <p>The ban has accelerated a trend away from pubs and bars in favour of cut-price supermarket drinks offers. On-trade sales declined 6% and now represent less than 60% of drinks sales in Ireland. </p> <p>Guinness in particular has suffered as drinkers have stayed at home. Mr Walsh said it was strongly linked in consumers' minds to the pub experience. \"If you are a Guinness adorer [in the pub], you do not automatically trade into Guinness in a can.\" </p> <p>Mr Walsh said similar migration away from pubs and bars was happening in Britain, with many brands losing ground to lager. Guinness volumes declined 3% in Britain, while Baileys and Smirnoff rose 5% and 11% respectively. </p> <p>Strong Smirnoff sales were offset by a 17% drop in revenues from Smirnoff Ice. Overall Diageo revenues were down 1% in Britain despite a 6% rise in volumes. </p> <p>The group's Blossom Hill Californian wines, which recently became the country's biggest-selling wine brand, now generate 8% of Diageo's revenues in the UK. </p> <p>Asked about adding to Diageo's wine interests, Mr Walsh said he believed some rival drinks groups had overpaid to gain a foothold in the growing category in recent years. </p> <p>Commenting on recent tax rises across mainland Europe targeted at sugar-rich alcopops - seen by some governments as marketed at children - Mr Walsh said: \"Some issues are wrongly laid at the door of RTDs [ready-to-drink alcopops].\" He defended Smirnoff Ice's packaging, insisting it could not be seen as targeting under-age drinkers. </p> <p>Mr Walsh confirmed there would be no marketing push to reverse the rapidly declining sales of its alcopop brands in the UK. The group's Archers Aqua showed a 27% reduction in volumes but will not be ditched. </p> <p>Diageo drew a sharp contrast between Europe and the US, where increasing numbers of people were reaching legal drinking age each year and consumer spend was showing encouraging growth. \"Europe remains our key business challenge and North America continues to provide our biggest opportunities,\" Mr Walsh said. </p> <p>Among notable successes in the US were Smirnoff branded alcopops, which generated 15% volume growth on the back of the launch of a new variety which was branded Smirnoff Twist V. </p> <p>Across all of its territories, Diageo showed a 4% rise in organic sales volumes and a 6% increase in revenues, excluding excise duty. Underlying pre-tax profit declined from \u00a32.1bn to \u00a32bn. Among the group's main international brands, the strongest growth was recorded for Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Captain Morgan. Earnings were hit by weakness in the dollar against the pound. </p> <p>Shares in the world's largest spirits group closed down 8p at 675.5p. House broker Cazenove reduced its rating on the stock from \"outperform\" to \"in-line\", saying there was little optimism in yesterday's results to offset the expected earnings reduction when the group sells its stake in General Mills.</p>",
  "The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, urged reform of the United Nations security council yesterday after criticising the body for its slow response to the humanitarian disaster in Sudan. <p>Mr Straw, in a speech calling for a reshaping of the UN to create a stronger body, said: \"We need to be able to act earlier, as threats emerge, and our action needs to be sustained.\" </p> <p>The UN is embarked on the latest of several attempts at reform over the last decade. </p> <p>An independent panel is preparing proposals by the end of the year for the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, including expanding the 15-member security council to 24. The Foreign Office and Downing Street are also trying to find a new set of post-Iraq criteria to justify UN intervention in sovereign states. </p> <p>Mr Straw said that the security council had expanded over the last few years the range of issues regarded as a threat to peace: overthrow of a democratically-elected government, terrorism, large-scale human rights violations, humanitarian catastrophe, refugee crises and states that flout their international obligations on weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>\"We now need to take that evolution further, with the council beginning to treat such issues more consistently, and as a matter of course, rather than in the relatively ad hoc way in which it has done so to date,\" he said. </p> <p>Since the Iraq invasion, the UN has embarked on peacekeeping missions in Liberia, Ivory Coast and Haiti, with a further mission pencilled in for Sudan if agreement is reached to end the north-south civil war. </p> <p>Mr Straw said: \"It can no longer be acceptable to classify situations such as that in Darfur, or before in Rwanda or Kosovo, as simply the concern of one national government.\" Governments had a responsibility towards their own people. \"So we are, correctly, not allowing the Sudanese government to regard the situation in Darfur as a sovereign matter which is none of the world's business - but, instead, we are putting pressure on that government to meet its responsibility to provide security for its own people.\" </p> <p>The security council yesterday began discussion on whether to apply sanctions against the Sudanese government. The likeliest outcome is a fudge that will see the Sudanese government given another 30 days to comply with UN demands. Although the British government officially refuses to rule out western military intervention in Darfur, it prefers to leave the issue of security to a force provided by the 53-member pan-continental African Union. </p> <p>Mr Straw, speaking at Chatham House, the London-based thinktank on international relations, said there had to be a quicker response to emerging threats. \"Despite the warnings from United Nations staff this spring of looming catastrophe in Darfur, and active efforts by the UK to draw international attention to the situation, it took the security council until the end of July to agree a resolution.\" </p> <p>Mr Straw supports the creation of a permanent strategic unit for Mr Annan that would try to identify failed states and crises such as Darfur early on. When the idea was floated two years ago, the US, backed by some developing states, opposed it. </p> <p>The foreign secretary touched on the issue of widening the security council, saying new members should be aware that with representation came responsibility. \"That does not necessarily imply accepting specific military commitments. But it does require strong engagement with security issues across the board wherever they arise.\" </p> <p>The panel is proposing expanding the council to 24 states but Britain and the other permanent members are refusing to give up their vetoes. Expansion is unlikely to happen, given the difficulty of agreeing who the new members should be and the unwillingness of existing members to give up their privileged position.</p>",
  "<p>In spite of harrowing reports almost daily from Sudan, the response of the international community remains abysmally slow. The United Nations identified Darfur in May as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, but it was July before it passed a resolution and set a 30-day deadline. A divided UN security council yesterday began discussion about what to do next, but the early signs suggest a reluctance to pursue any decisive action. The UN has subcontracted responsibility to the African Union, the 53-member pan-continental organisation. In many ways this is commendable: an African solution to an African crisis. But the AU too has been lamentably slow. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday acknowledged some of these shortcomings when he made a speech on how to make the UN stronger. He asked the right questions about reforming the UN, but offered few answers. </p> <p>The UN needs to respond faster and with more determination than it has shown so far in Darfur, where an estimated 600 are dying daily. After years of relative isolation and still subjected to US sanctions, the Sudanese government craves a complete return to the international community. It is susceptible to pressure and it would help if the security council was next week to threaten that failure of the Sudanese government to comply with UN demands would see the imposition of sanctions targeted against the leadership. The minimum the UN should be insisting on from the Sudanese government is to accept a significant increase in the AU force, from the 385 on the ground at present to more than 4,000, in a combination of soldiers and police. As the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, suggested on Wednesday when he delivered an assessment of the steps taken so far by the Sudanese government, the mandate of the AU should also be expanded from a purely monitoring role to patrolling. That could help restore some sense of security to the 1 million refugees who have fled to refugee camps within Darfur. </p> <p>The Sudanese government, responsible for unleashing the militia behind the killings, needs to be given fixed dates by the UN for disarming these militias, and arresting and punishing their leaders. Some Western diplomats see Darfur as just the latest in a long line of African calamities, to be bracketed alongside famine in Ethiopia and civil war in Congo. Such attitudes are unacceptable. At the start of the 21st century, there should be no tolerance by the international community for the government-inspired killings and famine of Darfur.</p>",
  "The Home Office suffered an embarrassing defeat last night when its plan to extend an immigration detention centre it once wanted to shut down was unanimously rejected by a local authority. <p>Campsfield House in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, is a male-only centre with security similar to a category C prison. It was earmarked for closure in 2002 when the home secretary, David Blunkett, expressed concern at the standard of accommodation it offered failed asylum seekers. </p> <p>It was reprieved after a fire at the Yarl's Wood centre, near Bedford, shortly afterwards. Last October the Home Office announced plans to send an extra 106 single male detainees to the centre, taking its capacity to 290. </p> <p>Cherwell district council refused an application last night to expand and modernise Campsfield following strong opposition from residents. Councillors at the meeting in Bodicote overruled planning officers and agreed that the Home Office had failed to make a special case to develop the green belt site on which Campsfield is located. </p> <p>Cllr Andrew Hornsby-Smith led the opposition. Speaking after the vote, he said there was no need to expand the centre because asylum applications had fallen and the backlog had also been reduced. </p> <p>\"I think morally the government ought to hold a public inquiry, given the level of opposition,\" he said. \"Whether that happens or not is another matter.\" </p> <p>He also expressed concern at the welfare of detainees, saying there had been two suicide attempts and a serious assault in the past month. </p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"We're very disappointed by the decision, and we will consider our response. </p> <p>\"Accommodation at Campsfield is in need of refurbishment, and our plans are to modernise the centre as part of the process of expansion.\" </p> <p>The Home Office's stated aim is to increase the number of removal centre places to 4,000 from the 1,726 places available at present.</p>",
  "After losing his father to the ravages of an unnaturally large bear, Torak finds himself on a desperate mission to save his prehistoric world from soul-eating demons. <p>He has spent his life on the run, isolated from his clan for reasons that unfold with the narrative.

He'd hated her from the first moment he'd smelt her, as she pointed the Long-Claw-That-Flies at his pack-brother.\" (The girl, her spear, the boy to we fellow-tailless.) </p> <p>Wolf, boy and girl each tell their version of events in chapters so short and headlong that there is not really time to draw breath, let alone look for any depth or texture, before we're plunged once more into a roaring river or hurled into an ice cave. </p> <p>Though the mythology may deepen as the saga progresses, there's nothing of the sophistication of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy, with which Wolf Brother shares enough (demons, bears, frozen wastes) to make comparison inevitable. </p> <p>It's hard to see it becoming a crossover hit with any but the most attention-impaired adults. In its favour, though, it's a rattling read, has a nicely detailed setting and covers enough reader interests - friendship, adventure, even pets - to keep male and female tailless cubs curled up in their dens for a few happy hours at least. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Claire Armitstead is the Guardian's literary editor.</p>",

The loss of two iconic players, Catt and Balshaw, won't actually change much because they barely played last season, but the big plus could be that last season's big signing Robbie Fleck will be available for the whole campaign. </p> <p><strong> Prediction</strong> 4th </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Christian Loader (Rotherham), Nick Walshe (Sale), Joe Maddock (Canterbury, NZ), Frikkie Welsh (Blue Bulls, SA). </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Kevin Maggs (Ulster), Mike Catt (London Irish), Wylie Human (Northampton), Iain Balshaw (Leeds), Ross Blake (Bristol), Joe Mbu (Harlequins), Hentie Martens, Jamie Williams. </p> <p><strong> GLOUCESTER</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Kingsholm </p> <p><strong> Director of rugby </strong> Nigel Melville </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Jake Boer </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> James Bailey is a wing who can follow in the vapour trail of James Simpson-Daniel. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> Big changes in the front row but the signing of Olivier Azam is a shrewd move as he knows his way round Kingsholm, and they will remain as tough to beat at home as ever. Their ground capacity has been increased but that won't make it any nicer to visit. They've kept much of their team's foundations, and Duncan McRae and Henry Paul will be lively at the back, so they will remain as competitive as ever. </p> <p><strong> Prediction </strong> 5th </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Adam Balding (Leicester), Christo Bezuidenhout (Blue Bulls), Gary Powell (Leeds), Olivier Azam (Montferrand), James Bailey (Bristol), James Parkes (Saracens), Terry Sigley (Pertemps Bees) </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Rodrigo Roncero (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), Junior Paramore (Bedford), Robert Todd (Sale), Trevor Woodman (Sale), Thinus Delport (Worcester), Andy Deacon, Steve Brotherstone. </p> <p><strong> HARLEQUINS</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> The Stoop </p> <p><strong> Director of rugby </strong> Mark Evans </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Andre Vos </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Ugo Monye can prove he is a lot more than a sevens specialist. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> They had a fine season, winning the Powergen Cup and getting to Europe, but they were heavily reliant on Paul Burke kicking their goals and will miss him. George Harder was vital as well - if he was in form the whole team went forward - and they will be even more reliant on him. Dafydd James will be a good foil to Harder but they will remain inconsistent, capable of beating the best teams, and losing to the lower lights. </p> <p><strong> Prediction </strong> 7th </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Opeta Palepoi, Steven So'oialo (Orrell), Dafydd James (Celtic Warriors), Jeremy Staunton (Munster), Maurice Fitzgerald (Biarritz), Joe Mbu (Bath), Maama Molitika (Celtic Warriors). </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Josh Taumalolo (Sale), Chris Bell (Leeds), Pat Sanderson (Worcester), Paul Burke (Munster), Scott Bemand (Leicester), Jason Leonard, Bill Davison, Rob Jewell, Matt Moore, Ben Willis, Laurent Gomez </p> <p><strong> LEEDS</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Headingley </p> <p><strong> Director of rugby </strong> Phil Davies </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Tom Palmer </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Chris Bell is built like a back-row forward - he will give the Tykes midfield much-needed bite after his move from Harlequins. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> Surprised a few big name clubs in recent years, but stuttered last season. Headingley is a hard place to visit but away form may be their weak point. They have recruited sensibly: Stimpson will be fresh and motivated after losing most of his season at Perpignan with injury, Balshaw needs to relaunch his international career, and Parks is a remarkable kicker. But it may not be enough to keep them out of the relegation battle. </p> <p><strong> Prediction </strong> 11th </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Tim Stimpson (Perpignan), Dan Parks (Celtic Warriors), Rayno Gerber (Free State), Iain Balshaw (Bath), Chris Bell (Harlequins), Chris Murphy (Pau), Mark McMillan (Glasgow), Pierre Uys (Stormers), Jon Dunbar (Newcastle). </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Dan Scarbrough (Saracens), Clive Stuart-Smith (Worcester), Phil Murphy (Worcester), Aaron Persico (Agen), James Ponton, Tristan Davies (Cardiff), Ryan Walker, Gary Powell (Gloucester), Matt Salter (Bristol). </p> <p><strong> LEICESTER</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Welford Road </p> <p><strong> Head coach </strong> John Wells </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Martin Johnson </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Louis Deacon will press Johnson and Ben Kay for a second-row spot. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> A massive clear-out, but two more members of the Tuilagi family have been signed, and if they are as powerful as Freddie, that will strike fear into the opposition. This could be a return to the great days for them, if they build on their performance against Wasps at the end of last season. Martin Johnson, Neil Back and company know they are close to the end of their careers, they will have no internationals to distract them, and will want more trophies before they quit. </p> <p><strong> Prediction</strong> 2nd </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Alex Tuilagi (Rugby Parma), Andy Tuilagi (Fogapoa Rugby Club, Samoa), Roger Warren (Marist St Joseph), Richard Cockerill (Montferrand), Seru Rabeni (Otago Highlanders, New Zealand), Ephraim Taukafa (Northern Suburbs, Australia), Scott Bemand (Harlequins). </p> <p><strong> Outs </strong> Adam Balding (Gloucester), Glenn Gelderbloom (Plymouth), James Richards (Newport), Tom Tierney (Connacht), Freddie Tuilagi (Cardiff Blues), Jaco Van Der Westhuyzen (NEC, Japan), Neil Baxter, Ricky Nebbett, Ramiro Pez, Dorian West, </p> <p><strong> LONDON IRISH</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Madejski Stadium </p> <p><strong> Head coach </strong> Gary Gold </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Ryan Strudwick </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Paul Hodgson is a scrum-half with lots of potential who will press Darren Edwards for his place. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> Inconsistency will be their big worry. They made a good start last season, but they weakened as the campaign wore on. They are a great team to play because they never close a game down. Robbie Russell is a great recruit, he\u00eds been a really dynamic character at Sarries, and if they can keep Mike Catt free of injury he will cause problems. Chris Sheasby is the big loss: a man who has been round almost all the London clubs, a big character, and a high-quality back row. </p> <p><strong> Prediction</strong> 9th. </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Paul Hodgson (Bristol), Robbie Russell (Saracens), Rod Penney (Orrell), Richard Skuse (Bristol), Mike Catt (Bath), Scott Staniforth (NSW Waratahs), Peter Poulos (Japan). </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Ed Thrower (Wasps), Rob Hoadley (London Irish), Naka Drotske, Chris Sheasby. </p> <p><strong> NEWCASTLE</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Kingston Park </p> <p><strong> Director of rugby </strong> Rob Andrew </p> <p><strong> Captains </strong> Jonny Wilkinson and Ian Peel </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Matthew Tait is one of the most promising young wings around. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> Rejoicing at the return of Jonny the national hero, and his presence will be important for them even if he will be absent during the autumn internationals and Six Nations. Matt Burke is the Premiership's biggest signing of the off-season, and his experience and strength will bring a new spark to the backs. They will be competitive, but they don't have the strength in depth to be at the top of the table. </p> <p><strong> Prediction </strong> 10th. </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Colin Charvis (Tarbes), Matthew Burke (NSW Waratahs), Andy Long (Rotherham), Mike McCarthy (Connacht), Semo Sititi (Borders), Luke Gross (Rotherham) </p> <p><strong> Outs </strong> Ben Gollings (Worcester), Hugh Vyvyan (Saracens), Jon Dunbar (Leeds), Phil Godman (Edinburgh), Warren Britz (Natal Sharks), Mark Andrews, Garath Archer. </p> <p><strong> NORTHAMPTON</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Franklin's Gardens </p> <p><strong> Head coach </strong> Alan Solomons </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Corne Krige </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Darren Fox is an open-side flanker who has expertly filled the gap left by the unlucky Budge Pountney. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> A little province of South Africa with the arrivals of Boome and Krige, who should have no trouble fitting in. Krige is an intelligent player with plenty of Super-12 experience, and Boome played at Grenoble for a spell. They are well organised, and have been at the top of their game for several years thanks to big public support in a town that lives for rugby. The loss of Matt Dawson will not be an issue: Mark Robinson's form kept him on the bench for much of last season. </p> <p><strong> Prediction </strong> 3rd </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Johan van Wyk (Border), Selborne Boome (Western Province), John Rudd (Wasps), Robbie Kempson (Ulster), Damien Browne (Connacht), Wylie Human (Bath), James Ross (Bedford), Corne Krige (Western Province), Marc Stcherbina (Biarritz). </p> <p><strong> Outs </strong> Ben Russell (Saracens), Matt Dawson (Wasps), James Brooks (Wasps), John Leslie, Nick Beal, Mark Connors. </p> <p><strong> SALE</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Edgeley Park </p> <p><strong> Director of rugby </strong> Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Jason Robinson </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Andrew Sheridan. At 24 his conversion to prop is still in the experimental stage but the 19-stone behemoth may be challenging for an England front-row place before long. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9's big return and one of the signings of the summer is Sebastian Chabal. As we say in France \"Touch him and you burn your fingers\". He is a devastating tackler. There is no reason why Saint Andr\u00e9 shouldn't eventually produce as dynamic a team as he did at Gloucester. Perhaps not this season, though. </p> <p><strong> Prediction</strong> 8th </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Sililo Martens (Celtic Warriors), Josh Taumalolo (Harlequins), Trevor Woodman (Gloucester), Sebastien Bruno (B\u00e9ziers), Ignacio Fernandez Lobbe (Castres), Robert Todd (Gloucester), Sebastien Chabal (Bourgoin), John Payne. </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Nick Walshe (Bath), Matt Cairns (Saracens), Alex Sanderson (Saracens), Iain Fullarton (Saracens), Kevin Yates (Saracens), Joe Bedford (Saracens), Andy Kyriacou (Saracens), Dan Harris, Vaughan Going, Braam Van Straaten, Stuart Pinkerton. </p> <p><strong> SARACENS</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Vicarage Road </p> <p><strong> Head coach </strong> Rod Kafer </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Hugh Vyvyan </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Nick Lloyd is a young prop with England potential. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> At least we have managed to keep the same coaches for two seasons running. There have been massive changes among the players, though. They've come from everywhere, and it may be hard getting everyone to know each other early on. Big reinforcements in the pack mean that last season's area of weakness is covered. All the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are there. Now we need to fit them together. </p> <p><strong> Prediction</strong> 6th </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Pila Fifita (North Otago), Glen Jackson (Waikato Chiefs), Ben Russell (Northampton), Nick Lloyd (Rotherham), Matt Cairns, Alex Sanderson, Iain Fullerton, Kevin Yates, Andy Kyriacou, Joe Bedford (all Sale), Hugh Vyvyan (Newcastle), Dan Scarbrough (Leeds), Mark Bartholomeusz (ACT), Moses Rauluni (Brisbane Easts). </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Steven Sparks (Worcester), James Parkes (Gloucester), Robbie Russell (London Irish), Emiliano Bergamaschi (Rosario, Argentina), Johnny Marsters, Tony Roques, Dan Kirton, Denis Cech, Adryan Winnan, Craig Yandell. </p> <p><strong> WASPS</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Causeway Stadium </p> <p><strong> Director of rugby </strong> Warren Gatland </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Lawrence Dallaglio </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> James Brooks is a versatile signing from Northampton who was often overlooked at Franklin's Gardens. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> The Martians of domestic rugby: on another planet to the rest of us, and that will not change with Lawrence Dallaglio putting all his focus into club rugby and Matt Dawson to back up Rob Howley. If everyone is on form, they are virtually unbeatable as they just wear you down physically then breeze through the gaps. The example to follow and tomorrow we will have to hope they are ring rusty and have celebrated last season's successes with too much gusto. </p> <p><strong> Prediction</strong> 1st </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Matt Priscott (Waikato), Ed Thrower (London Irish), Henry Nwume (Oxford University), Matt Dawson (Northampton), James Brooks (Northampton), Rob Hoadley (London Irish). </p> <p><strong> Outs</strong> Mark Denney (Castres), John Rudd (Northampton), Paul Volley (Castres), Kenny Logan (Glasgow), Shane Roiser. </p> <p><strong> WORCESTER</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ground </strong> Sixways </p> <p><strong> Director of rugby </strong> John Brain </p> <p><strong> Captain </strong> Ben Hinshelwood </p> <p><strong> One to watch </strong> Clive Stuart-Smith, the best young No9 in the land. </p> <p><strong> TC's verdict </strong> The usual enigma when a team is promoted. They were unstoppable in National League One, winning all their games well, and they have recruited far more aggressively than Rotherham did last season, so will be no pushover. Thomas Lombard will be a force to be reckoned with in the centre and Phil Murphy is a strong recruit, but their big weakness will be strength in depth: one key player injured and the pressure will really be on at the foot of the table. </p> <p><strong> Prediction</strong> 12th </p> <p> <strong> Ins</strong> Ben Gollings (Newcastle), Thinus Delport (Gloucester), Thomas Lombard (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), Steven Sparks (Saracens), Brad Macleod-Henderson (Rotherham), Phil Murphy (Leeds), Clive Stuart-Smith (Leeds), Pat Sanderson (Harlequins), Siaosi Vaili (Exeter), Chris Horsman (Celtic Warriors) </p> <p><strong> Outs </strong> Werner Swanepoel, Christian Evans, David Officer.</p>"
