  "<p><strong>The Motorcycle Diaries </strong><br>(126 mins, 15) <br>Directed by Walter Salles, starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Rodrigo De la Serna, Mia Maestro</p> <p>When he was murdered in Bolivia in October 1967 by the local army in association with the CIA, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara immediately took his place alongside Bolivar, Pancho Villa and other heroic Latin American revolutionaries. Comparable in popular appeal to Jack Kennedy, he immediately became for young people what TE Lawrence and Leon Trotsky had been for their parents, the contemporary model of the intellectual as man of action. </p> <p>Like Lawrence he was an irregular soldier who took up the cause of others. Like Trotsky he was a communist intellectual and second in command of a revolution that confounded political theory. Like both of them he was physically unprepossessing, but made up for this in charisma, and like them too, he died a violent death. </p> <p>All of them have been the subjects of movies, but only David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is a work of consequence, and the 1969 Hollywood picture Che! (co-scripted, like Lawrence, by Michael Wilson and starring an embarrassed Omar Sharif) is disastrous. Che also figured on stage narrating the grotesque Evita, but in Alan Parker's film version, while still called Che, he no longer wears the trademark bea0rd and beret and is more like the Brechtian 'Man of the People' in A Man for All Seasons. </p> <p>The tough, ruthless, ideologically driven Guevara, though still an icon of sorts through the ubiquity of the Alberto Korda photograph, is no longer the hero he once was. He's gone the way of Chairman Mao and his Little Red Book, to be replaced by the more benign figure of Nelson Mandela as the acceptable face of revolutionary politics. In fact, the Che that is offered us in Walter Salles's The Motorcycle Diaries is a diffident charmer, and the film is set in 1952, two years before he completed his medical studies, left his native Argentina for good, saw the CIA overthrow a democratic government in Guatemala, crossed into Mexico a confirmed revolutionary and met Fidel Castro. </p> <p> The Motorcycle Diaries is an account of a journey of social exploration and self-discovery undertaken by two men and based on books they wrote. The first is the 23-year-old Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) before he was nicknamed 'Che', the much loved son of a well-heeled middle-class family of Irish and Spanish descent living in Buenos Aires. The second is a family friend, the 29-year-old biochemist Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna). They set out on a decrepit 1939 Norton motorbike to travel 8,000 kilometres (nearly 5,000 miles) in five months and see the vast continent on which they live. The trek will take them across the Andes into Chile, through the Atacama Desert to Peru and, after a sojourn at a leper colony on the Amazon, they'll end up in Venezuela. They called their vehicle 'La Poderosa' ('The Mighty One') but it soon lets them down. Anticipating numerous spills to come, they nearly crash into a bus within sight of Guevara's waving family. </p> <p>In some ways the movie resembles Easy Rider, a picture made when Che's posthumous reputation was at its height, but it's altogether more cheerful, optimistic, benevolent, and Ernesto and Alberto are far more likeable and idealistic than the fashionable heroes of Dennis Hopper's movie. They're a complementary pair. The thin, asthmatic Ernesto is naive, withdrawn, compulsively honest and can't tell a tango from a mambo. The robust, moustached Alberto is a silver-tongued, outgoing womaniser, who can charm the birds off the trees and into bed. They are united by a belief in progress and what science and medicine can do for their region. What they discover as they pass through the beautiful, challenging landscape are the near-intractable problems of a continent of such physical and social extremes - mountains and endless flat plains; deserts and lush jungle; the complacent rich and the downtrodden poor; the great civilisation of the Incas that the Spanish conquistadors destroyed and the new cities with their endless slums. The magnificence of Machu Picchu is contrasted with the anonymous sprawl of Lima. </p> <p>The first stop is the grand hacienda in Miramar, south of Buenos Aires, where Guevara's fianc\u00e9e lives in confident splendour. It's a beautifully observed episode of social privilege. Subsequently, with vividness and wit, the film presents the pair's own experience of being indigent and marginal. </p> <p>The film tends to idealise the poor and suggest they have a monopoly on kindness and decency. But one of the pair's most striking encounters is with the dedicated Dr Pescu, a man of probity and a leading authority on leprosy. He takes them into his house and arranges for them to take a five-day boat trip to a leper colony on the Peruvian Amazon. But before they leave he asks them to read the novel he's been working on for years, and Guevara's response to a request for his opinion on it is a moment of great delicacy. </p> <p>This river journey to the heart of the continent takes on a powerful significance, and their working visit to the colony proves vital to both of them. Alfredo decides to retrain as a medical doctor and help the poor. Guevara's development is artfully revealed through a series of expressive gestures. He gives a precious reserve of money to a penniless, unemployed, communist couple they meet in the desert. He leaves some of his own essential medicine with a dying old woman. He throws a stone in anger at a truck belonging to the Anaconda Copper Company, the American firm exploiting Chilean miners. At the leper colony he is shocked that the hospital is on one side of the Amazon and the patients are kept on the other. To mark his 24th birthday he swims the river, braving the piranhas to symbolically unite the two parts, just after he has proposed a toast 'to Peru and to a United America'. </p> <p>The film draws together several countries in making a similar affirmation. The leading actors are Mexican and Argentine. Salles, whose best movie this is, is Brazilian. The excellent photography is the work of a Frenchman, Eric Gautier, and the producer is Robert Redford. Their film would, I think, still command our attention even if we didn't know what lies in store for its principal character, and it doesn't indulge in phoney hindsight. </p> <p>There's a clever variation on the conventional final montage in black and white of people they met on the journey. Instead of an expected succession of still photographs there is a faint suggestion of movement in these carefully posed pictures to tell us that these everyday Latin American folk are not frozen in time but vibrantly alive.</p>",
  "<p>I turn right, towards Machynlleth and the setting sun. The narrow road ribbons ahead of me, undulating down the valley to the promise of Tal-y-llyn lake shimmering in the distance. As I drive on, the rocky blades of Cadair Idris rise up around me, the steep slopes spilt with long patches of scree like countries mapped out in the bracken and purple heather. As I cross a bridge a fish jumps from the water and catches the light like a flicked silver coin. A young buzzard circles overhead and cries a short, sharp call. </p> <p>The place names, the landscape, the harsh and beautiful nature - all of this is unmistakably Welsh. As I drive deeper into the country, I imagine my route across the pages of a road atlas - the tangled arteries and capillaries of the motorways and A-roads of Manchester and Liverpool receding behind me, clearing to white and green, dotted with blue lakes. Just the slightest tracing of roads and lanes. Not a blue-veined motorway in sight. </p> <p>\"I like the aggression of the hills here. There's a corporeal hum in these mountains that infects you with a heightened emotional pitch.\" A couple of hours later I'm sharing a drink with novelist Niall Griffiths, who's explaining why he chooses to live and write in the mountain country of mid- and north Wales. \"It's the feeling you experience when you're writing or having sex. You find it in this landscape, too, as if you're living your life at a perpetual heightened state.\" Raised in Liverpool by a Welsh mother and English father, Niall returned to Wales to study poetry. He never left. </p> <p>I meet Niall at the George Borrow Hotel in Ponterwyd, a 17th-century coaching inn named after another writer drawn across the border by a love of Welsh poetry and landscape. In 1854, having established himself as a travel writer with books on Spain and Italy, George Borrow travelled through Wales and wrote an account of his journey, Wild Wales, that is still in print today. A century and a half later, I'm following part of his route through north Wales, encountering other writers, living and dead, along the way. </p> <p>Seduced by the Welsh language and its poetry as a boy, Borrow possesses the overzealous enthusiasm of the devout Celtophile. Wild Wales tells how a passer-by hears him speaking Welsh and asks if he's a local. \"I wish I was,\" he replies, \"or anything but what I am . . . I am ashamed to say I am an Englishman.\" </p> <p>As a south Walean in north Wales, I'm in a not too dissimilar situation. I've often experienced that peculiar Welsh variety of nostalgic longing for my homeland, hiraeth , but mine has always been for south Wales - the gentler, brooding hills of the Black Mountains, industry-scarred valleys, hedged farmland and the isolated beauty of the Gower and Pembrokeshire coastlines. North Wales is in many ways as alien to me as it would have been to Borrow. </p> <p>I realise this again the next day, as I drive north through the mountains of Snowdonia. A pair of red kites wheel overhead and the jagged hills, among the oldest in the world, rear up from smooth, alluvial valleys. They induce a humbling childlike sense of wonder and I understand what Niall meant about their \"corporeal hum\". Their bareness and emptiness is both inviting and intimidating. If the rolling hills of the south are swells in the green sea of Wales, it's in the north that those waves begin to break - sharp-peaked, curling tsunamis of rock and earth. </p> <p>But north Wales surprises in other ways. The town of Bala feels more like a Swiss or Italian summer resort, dinghies and windsurfers gliding on the lake and al fresco lunchers under sunshades in the streets. I'm reminded of Coleridge's brief stay here in 1794, when he provoked a bar fight by proposing a toast to George Washington. I am tempted to replicate this event with a toast to the current incumbent of the White House, but continue through the hills of Snowdonia to the lakeside village of Trawsfynydd. </p> <p>Although best known for its concrete castle of a nuclear power station (now being dismantled), Trawsfynydd is locally famous as the home of the poet Hedd Wyn, whose tragic story inspired an Oscar-nominated film. Hedd Wyn was a prodigious poet, winning his first bardic chair at a local eisteddfod at the age of 18. He went on to win five more. </p> <p>When his name was announced as the winner at the national eisteddfod in 1917, however, no one stood to claim the chair. Hedd Wyn had been called up that year, and was killed at Passchendaele a week before the prize-giving. He was 29. The ornately carved chair was draped in a black shroud and carried back, by train and horse and cart, to his family farmhouse on a hill overlooking the village. </p> <p>It's to this farmhouse I'm walking, through the heat and hay-turning smells of a summer's afternoon. Hedd Wyn's nephew, Gerald Williams, still lives at the farm and will, by appointment, show visitors Hedd Wyn's bardic chairs. The heritage centre in Trawsfynydd assures me there's no charge for this service, though Mr Williams will want to know where I'm from. \"Abergavenny,\" I tell him when we meet in the field below the farm. He turns this information over for a few moments, as a shopkeeper might examine a five-pound note. \"Y Fenni, I see. South,\" he says in a strong north Walean accent, before leading me into the dark interior of the low-ceilinged house. \"Sit down here for a while,\" he says, indicating one of six carved dark wood chairs in the small room, \"and wait for your eyes to adjust.\" </p> <p>When they do, Mr Williams tells me the whole Hedd Wyn story, illustrating his speech with photographs, poems and, of course, the bardic chairs. The \"black chair\" of the 1917 eisteddfod was carved by a Belgian refugee who lived just a few miles from where Hedd Wyn was killed. Mr Williams explains the meanings behind its carvings: \"These ribbons symbolise eternity; these are the animals of darkness looking away from the light; these the four elements necessary for man's survival.\" </p> <p>I ask him what he thought of the film. He smiles, and scratches his head under his tweed cap. \"Well, I thought it was quite good, but there was too much beer and women. The beer, I know that couldn't be true - they couldn't afford to drink like that - and the women ... well, I can't be sure.\" He pauses and looks out of the window at the fields. \"But he was, how do you say, quite the young star here. When he won the eisteddfod, all the girls wanted to say they'd been out with Hedd Wyn. He was like the David Beckham of the area.\" </p> <p>I leave Mr Williams to his hay-making and continue north. At Porthmadog I meet the sea. Crossing the estuary, a maelstrom of hills in the east rages up in contrast to the flat ocean in the west. I drive on through the town and all the hallmarks of a British summer coastal resort: boys jumping from the bridge into the river, luminous mushy peas slopped over piles of chips, and a lot of boiled-fish-white flesh squeezed through gaps in Lycra. Further along the Llyn peninsula the atmosphere is calmer, the dramatic castle at Criccieth perched above hill-buckled rows of houses and the sweeping bay below. </p> <p>The literary heritage in this part of Wales is especially rich. The travel writer Jan Morris lives nearby and dedicated her book A Writer's World \"to the honour of Wales\", imploring the publishers to make the font as large as possible. The poet-priest RS Thomas, who is buried at Criccieth, had a more complex relationship with Wales and the Welsh. A lifelong campaigner for the Welsh language, he still often turned his searing eye upon his own people: </p> <p>An impotent people, </p> <p>sick with inbreeding </p> <p>worrying the carcass of an old song. </p> <p>Further up the coast in Llanystumdwy is Ty Newydd, the house of Lloyd George (who is also buried in the village), which now operates as a residential writing centre. It was in Llanystumdwy that Thomas De Quincy spent a bizarre few days in 1803. In Confessions of an English Opium Eater, he describes how he stayed at a house with just the children of a local family, writing love letters for the two young daughters (\"one of uncommon loveliness\"), only to hightail it when the parents returned. </p> <p>All these writers have shared a deep attraction to the landscape. The \"heightened emotional pitch\" that Niall Griffiths described affects all of them at some point in their writing. As RS Thomas puts it in Small Window: </p> <p>In Wales here are jewels </p> <p>To gather, but with the eye </p> <p>Only. A hill lights up </p> <p>Suddenly; a field trembles </p> <p>With colour and goes out </p> <p>In its turn; in one day </p> <p>You can witness the extent </p> <p>Of the spectrum and grow rich with looking. </p> <p>Or, as Jan Morris says in Wales: The First Place, \"I see exemplified in it the four elements themselves, the foundation of all things: the earth rich in the loyalties of the place.\" </p> <p>Borrow's appreciation of the Welsh landscape in Wild Wales is similarly effusive, and as I walk along the front at Beaumaris on Anglesey that evening, I'm reminded of his reflections 150 years before. \"What a bay!\" he wrote. \"For beauty it is superior to the far-famed Naples.\" </p> <p> H aving spent the weekend looking at these mountains, I finish my journey the next day by climbing Mount Snowdon, or Yr Wyddfa, to give it its Welsh name. In high season more than a thousand walkers make their way to the summit every day, but I'm alone for much of the climb. Rounding the Pyg Track above Glaslyn, I see the summit and once again experience a moment of \"landscape shock\". The ascending ridge forms a stadium of stone, steep-sided, ragged and cradling the lake at its base. The sky is milky and a gathering wind turns the mist in the valley below, making the scene all the more mysterious. As I continue, Thomas Gray's lines from The Bard come to mind. Having cursed Edward I for conquering Wales and killing its poets, the bard lets himself fall: </p> <p>Headlong from the mountain's height </p> <p>Deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night. </p> <p>Managing to avoid any similar mishap, I reach the summit and look out across Wales. Others about me do the same, breathing heavily and taking in the view from the highest mountain south of Scotland. Borrow is typically ecstatic when he stands in the same spot in 1854: \"Peaks and pinnacles and huge moels stood up here and there, about us and below us, partly in glorious light, partly in deep shade. Manifold were the objects which we saw from the brow of Snowdon.\" </p> <p>It's more than likely that when Borrow wrote this he had another description of the view already running in his mind - that written by Wordsworth in book XIII of The Prelude. I've always found it interesting that Wordsworth chose to close his epic poem with his ascent of Snowdon, and not a local peak in the Lake District. As I drive away from the open spaces of north Wales, it's these lines, written 200 years ago this year, that repeat in my head, describing as they do that strange effect, partly physical, partly psychological, that a powerful landscape can have upon us. </p> <p>I found myself of a huge sea of mist, </p> <p>Which, meek and silent, rested at my feet: </p> <p>A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved. </p> <p>All over this still Ocean, and beyond, </p> <p>Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves, </p> <p>In headlands, tongues and promontory shapes </p> <p>... it appear'd to me </p> <p>The perfect image of a mighty Mind, </p> <p>Of one that feeds upon infinity, </p> <p>That is exalted by an underpresence, </p> <p>The sense of God, or whatsoe'er is dim </p> <p>Or vast in its own being ...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Owen Sheers is writer in residence at the Wordsworth Trust, Grasmere.

  "<p>'Ten years ago the tourist trade would have shut down between September and Easter. Today there's no such thing as a quiet weekend,\" says Cliff Nye, owner of the White Horse pub at Brancaster Staithe in north Norfolk. </p> <p>A stunning coastline with magnificent sandy beaches has attracted second home owners and an increase in holidaymakers, which has transformed the food scene, particularly in pubs. \"It's quite phenomenal how it's changed\", says Hoste Arms owner Paul Whittome, who is credited with starting the food revolution in north Norfolk when he bought the pub 15 years ago. </p> <p>With the exception of Fishes, all the restaurants and pubs mentioned here also have rooms. </p> <p><strong> Byfords, Holt</strong><br> </p> <p> This Grade II-listed building in the market town of Holt is home to a bustling cafe that turns into a relaxed bistro at night, a deli and a new B&amp;B.

  "<p>If I call my parents early on a Saturday evening and they're already sounding tipsy it can mean only one thing: Tony from next door has been making sangria and passing them glassfuls over the fence. </p> <p>Tony's sangria is legendary. When neighbours invite him to a barbecue they send for him early especially to make up a few jugs. It beats the socks off any I've ever tasted, including one the other week at the famous Club 55 restaurant on Pampelonne beach, near St Tropez (theirs used cinnamon, which gave it a much too full and festive flavour). </p> <p>Tony's recipe has real Spanish pedigree. It came from the then-young owner of a small restaurant called La Kazueala in Estepona, near Marbella, in the south of Spain. He persuaded him to part with it in 1986 and, when he went back recently to enjoy a glass of the original stuff, found everything had changed: the restaurant no longer existed and the handsome young restaurant manager had left his wife and moved on. In any case, Tony has now made the drink his own. According to him, the secret is not to make it too alcoholic. 'People tend to think they're being \"best host\" if they make a drink very strong, but that philosophy doesn't work with sangria. It should be refreshing rather than boozy.' </p> <p>How wise. Sangria is an afternoon, not an evening, drink. You want to be able to knock a few back while you sit in the garden with a book or fight with the lighter fuel and charcoal, and still be standing when it's time to start on the neat wine. So quell the temptation to let your hand slip with the spirits. The drink is very fruity and doesn't go well with food, so don't try to serve it with poncy nibbles, either. It doesn't need them. </p> <p>Here's how to make it. It's a movable feast, so don't panic if you don't have all the spirits. I forgot the marsala last time I made it and no one fretted. Mix one bottle of cheap Spanish red wine ('I use supermarket plonk, usually from Morrisons. You shouldn't spend more than \u00a33,' says the master) with half a wine-bottleful (ie, 375ml) of lemonade. Add one measure (about 25ml) of gin; one of brandy; one of golden rum; one of marsala, madeira or m\u00e1laga; and one of red martini. Add a mixture of chopped fruit - oranges, peaches and bananas work well. Try to avoid pears, which tend to discolour very quickly. Chill in the fridge for a couple of hours and serve in large wine glasses with lots of ice. One last thing: as Tony points out, the marinated fruit is delicious for breakfast the next morning.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Saturday August 28</strong></p> <p><strong>They Live By Night </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1948) <br>1.50pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Kicking off a Nicholas Ray season this week on BBC2 is this marvellous combination of love story and crime thriller. Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell are the young sweethearts forlornly trying to escape the attentions of his former convict allies, Jay C Flippen and the thoroughly menacing Howard da Silver. </p> <p><strong>Bigger Than Life </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1956) <br>3.25pm, BBC2 </p> <p>More Ray: James Mason produced as well as stars in this account of a schoolteacher who seems to have been saved from a fatal illness by the experimental wonder-drug cortisone - then starts to undergo frightening personality changes. A little masterpiece. </p> <p><strong>Terminator II: Judgment Day </strong>(James Cameron, 1991) <br>9.10pm, ITV1 </p> <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the cyborg from a machine-ruled future world, making mayhem in the present: but this time he's the good guy, defending surrogate family Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong against state-ofthe- art terminator Robert Patrick. The latter's liquid-metal body transformations are eye-boggling, and the sequel is even more explosive than the original. </p> <p><strong>Sunday August 29</strong></p> <p><strong>Thoroughly Modern Millie </strong>(George Roy Hill, 1967) <br>3.50pm, ITV1 </p> <p>This thoroughly old-fashioned musical catches Julie Andrews still riding the crest of her Sound Of Music wave. Her Millie leaves provincial Kansas far behind to make it big in charleston-era New York, running into James Fox's surprisingly effective song and dance man on the way. </p> <p><strong>The Out Of Towners </strong>(Arthur Hiller, 1970) <br>3.50pm, Five </p> <p>Neil Simon's comedy about the misadventures of a hapless Ohio couple in the big, bad apple is so black it makes you wince while you laugh. Jack Lemmon is the exec who combines a job interview in New York with a little break with wife Sandy Dennis: big mistake. Soon the pair are suffering aeroplane diversions, losing their luggage, and missing out on their swanky hotel. Good, vicious fun. </p> <p><strong>Tigerland </strong>(Joel Schumacher, 2000)<br> 9pm, BBC2 </p> <p>The film that marked Colin Farrell as a big-screen action hero. In Schumacher's surprisingly lean and hard war movie, he plays a rebel soldier among the Vietnam conscripts undergoing hellish training at a jungle assault course called Tigerland. It's done in a deliberately low-budget style, with naturalistic performances and handheld camera work creating the immediacy of a documentary. </p> <p><strong>Magnolia </strong>(Paul Thomas Anderson, 1999) <br>11.05pm, C4 </p> <p>Anderson's follow-up to the brilliant Boogie Nights takes the piecemeal Altman approach of Short Cuts, weaving the thinly connected lives of a group of San Fernando Valley inhabitants into a deep and dark portrait of modern America. Among those under the spotlight are Jason Robards as a dying, guilt-ridden father, Julianne Moore his young wife and Philip Seymour Hoffman as his nurse; plus a bunch of people - including William H Macy - involved with a TV quiz show; but the real star turn is from Tom Cruise. The result is at times pretentious but utterly riveting, all the way to the extraordinary conclusion. </p> <p><strong>Thirteen Days </strong>(Roger Donaldson, 2000) <br>11.15pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Donaldson's gripping and powerful account of the Cuban missile crisis recreates all the paranoid fears and tensions that brought the world to the brink of nuclear armageddon in 1962. Resisting the hawks' urgings for a pre-emptive strike against the Russians was President John F Kennedy's finest hour, and Bruce Greenwood's spot-on performance, allied to David Self 's script - a fascinating study of a game of double-bluff played for enormous stakes - do him full justice. With a surprisingly effective Kevin Costner. </p> <p><strong>Monday August 30</strong></p> <p><strong>A Woman's Secret </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1949) <br>11.25am, BBC2 </p> <p>Scripted by Herman J Mankiewicz, co-writer of Citizen Kane, Ray's drama incorporates a similarly ingenious flashback structure, but there the similarities end. This is otherwise a standard tale of murdered singer Gloria Grahame, her wealthy friend - and prime suspect - Maureen O'Hara, and Melvyn Douglas as the inquisitive guy trying to figure it all out. </p> <p><strong>An American Tail </strong>(Don Bluth, 1986) <br>1.20pm, ITV1 </p> <p>First and best of the four cartoon movies about mouse family the Mousekewitzes, tracing their emigration in the 1880s from oppressive Russia to the US where, Papa insists, there are no cats. He's wrong: there's Tiger (voiced by Dom DeLuise) the friendly feline for one, and he becomes the pal of young Fievel Mousekewitz. A delightful children's adventure. </p> <p><strong>The True Story Of Jesse James </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1956)<br> 2.30pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Despite the weakness of Hollywood pin-ups Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter as the James brothers, this is a thoughtful remake of Henry King's 1939 Jesse James. It explores the background of oppression from whence the legend sprang, and culminates in the lowdown murder by the Fords. </p> <p><strong>Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid </strong>(George Roy Hill, 1969) <br>3.25pm, Five This charming, lighthearted western features one of the great \"buddies\" pairings: Newman and Redford's affable, slightly dim outlaws remain forever freezeframed on the memory. Despite the sepia-toned nods towards authenticity and some Peckinpahesque slo-mo violence, it's really a mock western that comically deflates the traditional set-pieces of the genre: the train robbery, the fistfights and gunfights. Marvellously watchable. </p> <p><strong>Breakfast At Tiffany's </strong>(Blake Edwards, 1961) <br>3.30pm, C4 </p> <p>Edwards makes a sparkling, sophisticated comedy out of Truman Capote's slight novella. In Audrey Hepburn he has the living embodiment of the volatile and ever-so-chic Holly Golightly, flitting through Manhattan society but also suggesting the Lulumae from Texas she once was (\"She may be phony, but she's a real phony\"). </p> <p><strong>Murder On The Orient Express </strong>(Sidney Lumet, 1974) <br>5.35pm, C4 </p> <p>An Agatha Christie murder mystery as old-fashioned as a game of Cluedo: who killed industrialist Richard Widmark, on the train, with the knife? Albert Finney as Belgium's most famous character, the detective Hercule Poirot, must solve the case before the Orient Express hits Paris in a lustrous and fascinating thriller. With Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, John Gielgud and Vanessa Redgrave. </p> <p><strong>US Marshals </strong>(Stuart Baird, 1998) <br>9pm, Five </p> <p>Disappointing sequel to The Fugitive, the main problem being that Harrison Ford really has got away from this one and his substitute, Wesley Snipes, lacks Ford's brand of haunted gravitas. Still, there's some big action - a plane crash-escape; Snipes leaping from tower block to train - and, when all else fails, there's Tommy Lee Jones. </p> <p><strong>The Ice Storm </strong>(Ang Lee, 1997) <br>10.30pm, BBC2 </p> <p>A delicately crafted, superbly acted study of suburban morality in 1970s America: all self-consciously hip partner-swapping parties and inner torment. It focuses on the Hood family. Student son, Paul (Tobey Maguire) is returning home for Christmas, finding parents Kevin Kline and Joan Allen's relationship in deep freeze. </p> <p><strong>Working Girl </strong>(Mike Nichols, 1988) <br>11.25pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Witty, very deft romantic comedy with its heart firmly in the 1930s. Melanie Griffith is the secretary trying to go places in the company, but she is being exploited by imperious corporate woman, Sigourney Weaver. Harrison Ford is the other point in the triangle, shifting allegiance from Weaver to Griffith. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday August 31</strong></p> <p><strong>Twister </strong>(Jan De Bont, 1996) <br>8pm, ITV1 </p> <p>With a combination of the director of Speed and the SFX-heavy The Haunting and Michael Crichton, the man behind Jurassic Park, it's hardly surprising this is another dose of furious, simple-minded action. It follows a group of weird people who are trying to get into the funnel of a tornado to place a recording device. With Bill Paxton, Helen Hunt and Jami Gertz. </p> <p><strong>DOA </strong>(Rocky Morton, Annabel Jankel, 1988) <br>11.05pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Classy remake of Rudolph Mat\u00e9s 1950 film noir, which opens with a man waking up to discover he has been poisoned, and spends his last day hunting his own killer. Dennis Quaid is excellent as a drunken professor of literature; and Meg Ryan is top-of-the-class as the student who helps him meet the deadline - though Charlotte Rampling is more your noir femme. <strong>Wednesday September 1</strong></p> <p><strong>Raiders Of The Lost Ark </strong>(Steven Spielberg, 1981) <br>8pm, BBC1 </p> <p>\"Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?\" Nice Spielbergian touch to give his heroic adventurer Indiana Jones these little human fears and foibles. First, fastest and funniest of the Jones trilogy, with Harrison Ford's indestructible archaeologist chasing from Nepal to Cairo with feisty partner Karen Allen to whip the Ark Of The Covenant from under Nazi noses. </p> <p><strong>Crazy/Beautiful </strong>(John Stockwell, 2001) <br>11.30pm, BBC1 </p> <p>A likable, different-sides-of-thetracks teenie romance. Kirsten Dunst's Nicole is the spoilt daughter of a congressman, wasting her time at school; Carlos (Jay Hernandez) is the hardworking son of a poor Hispanic family in East LA. They fall for each other, of course, and rattle through the traditional trials of the genre, but it's engagingly played and wittily directed by Stockwell. </p> <p><strong>On Dangerous Ground </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1951) <br>11.50pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Ray considered this an \"absolute failure\", perhaps because of the upbeat ending foisted on him by RKO. He's too harsh: it's a sharp noir thriller with a desperate, intense relationship at its core. Robert Ryan is terrific as a violent cop at the end of his tether, whose encounter with blind Ida Lupino offers a chance of redemption. </p> <p><strong>Mean Streets </strong>(Martin Scorsese, 1973) <br>12.40am, ITV1 </p> <p>Scorsese returns to the New York streets of his youth, all small-time crookery and looming mafiosi in a sharply naturalistic view of Little Italy. Volatile, muscular acting from Robert De Niro as twitchy, pork-pie-hatted punk Johnny-Boy and Harvey Keitel his more measured, more dangerous friend, Charlie, hanging around the bar. It crackles with energy - one of Scorsese's masterworks. </p> <p><strong>Thursday September 2</strong> </p> <p><strong>Pulp </strong>(Mike Hodges, 1972) <br>12.05am, BBC1 </p> <p>Hodges made this as something of an antidote to the brutality of his seminal British gangster film, Get Carter. Michael Caine, who played Carter, is again his star, playing a pulp fiction writer who finds life mirroring his art when the subject of the memoirs he is ghosting dies suddenly. His amateur detective work leads him into mob business in a well-written comedy thriller. <strong>Friday September 3</strong></p> <p><strong>His Kind Of Woman </strong>(John Farrow, 1951) <br>1.35pm, BBC2 </p> <p>This film noir out of Howard Hughes's RKO studio is a wild and wacky experience. Set almost entirely at night, it stars Robert Mitchum as a down-on-his-luck gambler who gets caught up in a plot to smuggle mobster Raymond \"Ironside\" Burr out of exile and back into the States. Sheer delight. </p> <p><strong>Rollercoaster </strong>(James Goldstone, 1977) <br>12.35am, ITV1 </p> <p>Mad saboteur Timothy Bottoms adds extra spice to the fairground rides when he arranges big dipper carnage: can health and safety man George Segal put the brakes on his evil blackmail scheme? It plays on all those roller-coaster fears of being hurled to oblivion, but it's no edge-of-the-seater.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> 020-7798 6888<br><strong>Address:</strong> Dolphin Square, Chichester Street, London SW1<br><strong>Rating: </strong>16.5/20</p> <p>\u2022 Allium has closed down since this review was published.</p> <p>Before Allium was Allium, or rather allium, as the logo has it, it was Rhodes in the Square, as in Gary Rhodes in Dolphin Square, when Gary was all over our television screens and Rhodes restaurants were popping up like daffodils in spring. That was then and this is now, and all those Rhodes restaurants have quietly taken on other identities. </p> <p>Dolphin Square is a curiosity - an apartment fortress of middle-class virtue in the wilds of Pimlico. Once inside its staid corridors, it's hard to imagine a world of Big Brother, Asbos, yob culture, iPods or even the Olympic games. It's a muffled universe, comfortable, solid, old-fashioned, more John Nettles than Nadia. Yes, for all I know it may be heaving with delinquent aristos, derelict swingers, faded pop stars, arms dealers and corporate pirates from the world over. But it certainly doesn't seem that way. </p> <p>Allium occupies a central space just inside the main entrance, and doesn't seem to have changed much in looks from the Rhodes days. The dominant colour is a kind of deep royal blue. And when I say dominant, I mean dominant - walls, carpets, chairs, the lot. There is a fair amount of chrome, too, and what look like portholes. What with the odd, telling splash of lime green, it reminded Mrs Fort, Miss Fort and me of nothing so much as the dining room on a smart cruise ship. I half expected to see a lot of chaps in blazers and yachting caps and women in slacks and silk blouses sitting down to lunch, but they were mostly very done up in blue or grey suiting - the women and the men. </p> <p>The food, on the other hand, was definitely not of the cruise ship variety. The chef patron is listed as Anton Edelmann, longtime kitchen supremo at the Savoy hotel, and generally recognised as one of the most accomplished practitioners of his trade by his trade. The head chef, the fellow actually in charge of the day-to-day running of the kitchen, is Peter Woods. The food at Allium is, not surprisingly, right off the old Savoy River Room style sheet - smart, lively, light, modern and French. </p> <p>Miss Fort started with tortellini of c\u00e8pes, followed by poached chicken breast, fried potatoes with artichokes and bacon, and finishing with rhubarb crumble and vanilla ice cream. For Mrs Fort it was ballottine of guinea fowl with sweetcorn and red onion salsa; seared fillet of bream with summer vegetables and herb beurre blanc; and plum tart with cinnamon ice cream. Scallops on caramelised sweetbreads, with lemon and thyme reduction; roast guinea fowl, summer vegetables and light velout\u00e9 of tarragon; and whole baked peach with ginger and lemon, to bring up the rear, did for me. </p> <p>There was only one out and out failure in all of these dishes - the ballottine of guinea fowl with the salsa, which looked pretty meagre on the plate and tasted of nothing at all, said Mrs Fort. Mrs Fort is a stern critic, and I trust her judgment implicitly. With the arrival of her seared fillet of bream she got over her disappointment, and a couple of mouthfuls into the dish was purring with pleasure. It was a judiciously rich combination, with crisp, compact fish resting on silky mash and velvety sauce. Miss Fort was purring from the word go. She is an authority on pasta and the tortellini had perfect pitch as far as she was concerned. She even offered to let me try some, and I agreed. She set about the chicken breast with equal vigour and put it away with similar enthusiasm. Rightly, too. The cooking was professional in the best sense of the word. The basics were correct, the little details attended to, the whole unchallenging perhaps, but satisfying nevertheless. </p> <p>My dish of scallops and caramelised sweetbreads was the nearest thing to serious originality that we ate and, while it was fine, and all the parts perfectly cooked, I couldn't help asking, \"Why?\" I don't think there is enough of a contrast or a symbiosis between the offal and the shellfish to provide the answer. With the guinea fowl and summer veg I was back in more familiar and happier territory. The bird was juicy and full flavoured. The peas in the summer vegetables had come from pods, not packets, and the light velout\u00e9 of tarragon was just that - luxuriant, not cloying, and shot with that odd wildness of tarragon. </p> <p>All the puddings were greeted with marked enthusiasm. For once the crumble had the right proportion of topping to fruit (3:1). Mrs Fort remarked on the perfection of her pastry. Peaches take to baking very well, particularly when lifted with ginger and lemon, a fine, clever touch. </p> <p>The bill was solid without being wallet-crippling - \u00a385.80, with a further \u00a340.25 for a bottle of fine ros\u00e9 and various other drinks. Mrs Fort ate off the daily menu - \u00a322.50 for three courses. Miss Fort supplemented the daily menu - \u00a317.50 for two courses - with the tortellini of c\u00e8pes from the \u00e0 la carte. </p> <p>You don't have to guess whose lunch was the most expensive. So, you see, we had a fine time and a fine lunch. It didn't challenge, exactly, but I'm not sure that Dolphin Square is the place for challenges.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Open:</strong> Lunch: Tues-Fri, 12noon-3pm.

  "<p>I'm not sure I should be admitting this, but it was only recently I got my first mobile phone. What I do know is that I've bought into something that gives me more issues to worry about. For a start, there's my health, with reports that too much phone use can seriously damage your head. This is because mobiles emit microwave radiation, which could be bad for you in large quantities. There is no conclusive proof of directly harmful effects from mobile use, but enough concern for at least one independent report to recommend that children should limit their use. Precautionary measures might include more texting or even, dare I say it, fewer calls. </p> <p>Thankfully, I don't live near a phone mast. Or do I? In a city it's hard to tell. There are worries that these masts, or base stations, cause mystery illnesses and sleepless nights for those living near them. Again: no proof as yet. </p> <p>Another fear is that a key element of mobiles, the heat-conducting mineral coltan, has been finding its way on to the market from illegal mines in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (where 80% of the world's coltan is found). Human rights groups say coltan helps to finance those \"perpetrating the conflict\", while environmentalists say forests are being cleared and animals killed to make way for mining. </p> <p>Major handset manufacturers - among them Panasonic, Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson - claim safeguards are in place to help them avoid illegally mined coltan. And they are asking, \"Why pick on us?\" Coltan is found in all sorts of electronics. </p> <p>These companies are part of a huge business in new mobiles (some 50m are in circulation in the UK alone). But reconditioned phones are a big industry, too, sold in bulk to south-east Asia, eastern Europe and Africa. </p> <p>You should expect, then, to get some kind of trade-in when you buy a new phone. But you can go one better and ensure that some of the proceeds from your old handset go to charity. There are plenty of places on the high street where you can pick up a freepost envelope in which to send off old mobiles for recycling; in return, a donation goes to a good cause. Get an envelope from <strong>HSBC</strong>, for example, and \u00a33 goes to the tree planting people Future Forests. Similar schemes are run by <strong>Comet</strong> (Macmillan) and the <strong>Body Shop</strong> (Refuge). On top of a donation to children's charity NCH, clothing chain <strong>Peacocks</strong> will throw in a \u00a310 voucher to spend in its store, while <strong>Tesco</strong> promises club card points. </p> <p>You can also also give handsets direct to charities. <strong>Oxfam</strong>, for example, collects them at its shops and gets an average of \u00a35 for every mobile it sells on to a recycler - top whack is \u00a345. So far, Oxfam has earned \u00a3100,000 recycling phones. </p> <p>The demand for reconditioned mobiles is not just with bulk buyers abroad, either. In this country, there is an emerging market for individual handsets trading on their sense of retro cool (see eBay and the soon-to-be launched website retrofone.com). </p> <p>Ah, \"retro\" - along with \"vintage\" and \"old-school\", so much sexier a word than \"second-hand\". If only we could do a similar rebranding thing with \"recycle\", then I'm convinced more people would take to the idea. Still, anything that keeps phones out of landfill is totally fine by me. </p> <p><strong>For health issues:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mastsanity.org\">mastsanity.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.powerwatch.org.uk\">powerwatch.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sarvalues.com\">sarvalues.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mastaction.co.uk\">mastaction.co.uk</a>.

  "The prisoners' hunger strike in Palestine is nearing the end of its second week. Three days ago, in Askar and then Balata refugee camps near Nablus, Israeli troops ran amok in the camps, making mass arrests, beating women and children, shooting civilians at will, and adding to the huge prison population - currently well over 7,500. According to Israeli sources, more than 650,000 Palestinian men and boys have gone through Israeli detention at some point in their lives. That is over 40% of the male population in the occupied Palestinian territories. At certain periods when the Israelis are trying to break Palestinian resistance, they imprison anyone they can get their hands on. For example, during the first Intifada Israel detained 50,000 Palestinians in a single year, representing 16% of the male population aged between 14 and 55 of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. <p>Just who are the military holding in these prisons? Mostly they are young, and most are detained illegally, without charge or trial. Generally, they are the most active members of their local community, and the majority are detained for non-military activities. Most of them have gone through what can only be called show trials, in military courts, where collaborators and undercover army officers testify against them in secret. </p> <p>Among them there are Islamic militants, party activists, and respected leaders such as Marwan Barghouti and Hussam Khader - thousands who are incarcerated for years without visitors, the ability to make phone calls, enough food, or basic rights. There are more than 600 children in these prisons. </p> <p>The conditions in the prisons cannot be believed. The facilities in which juveniles are held are exceptionally bad. In Megiddo and Ketziot military prison camps, which are run by the Israeli army, children are treated as adults and held in threadbare tents which offer little protection against freezing winters and scorching summers. Bedding consists of wooden pallets covered by a thin mattress, and there are four toilets and two showers for every section in which about 120 detainees are held. A young woman, Su'ad Ghazal, was punished for writing details about the terrible prison conditions in a letter to a French human rights organisation. </p> <p>Palestinian children are also detained in the Telmond Compound and Ramle Women's Prison, administered by the Israeli prison service, where they are locked in their cells for hours on end with, in some cases, only 45 minutes outdoor exercise allowed every two days. Many are forced to sleep on the floor due to overcrowding. Windows are boarded up with iron panels, which block out the light and intensify the heat in the rooms. The prison guards routinely and arbitrarily beat and humiliate Palestinian detainees. </p> <p>Though these are all political prisoners - held by foreign military occupiers - this hunger strike is not a political strike. The 2,269 prisoners who began the strike were asking for humane conditions, such as the cessation of public strip searches, the ability to use the telephone, to be able to see their families, and an end to arbitrary and indiscriminate beatings. These are not privileges or favours. The prisoners want the authorities to respect internationally recognised rules governing imprisonment. The minimum standards can be found in articles of the 1949 Geneva conventions, which should be applied to prisoners in occupied territories. Now more than 4,000 prisoners have joined the strike. </p> <p>How have the Israeli authorities responded to this appeal by Palestinian prisoners to be treated as human beings? When the strike entered its second week and the prisoners began to fall ill, the Israeli health minister, Danny Naveh, refused to allow them access to prison hospital facilities. \"Let them be treated where they lie ... we don't want these murderers in hospital,\" he said. </p> <p>The Israeli public security minister, Tzahi Hanegbi, announced to the press: \"They can strike for a day, a month, until death. We will ward off this strike and it will be as if it never happened.\" He has ordered large, open grills to be set up to barbecue meat and for bread to be baked just outside the prison doors, to torture prisoners with the smells. Prison guards are encouraged to eat all this in front of the fasting prisoners. On August 13 Hanegbi announced that, as far as he was concerned, the prisoners could \"starve to death\". </p> <p>When similar savage images and stories emerged from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, they turned the stomachs of those in the west who saw them. The international outcry was immediate and profound. Now the activities of another liberal democracy's occupying forces are on public display, yet the collective silence, and the complicity of the British and American press in not covering it, astonishes and bewilders Palestinians everywhere. </p> <p>Worse, the prisoners' predicament inside Palestine is simply a microcosm of the Palestinians' predicament outside the prison walls; for what the Israelis are doing to the prisoners inside their prisons they are doing to Palestinians everywhere - in their land and off it. The collective punishment, the contempt, the daily robbery - the prison gates are everywhere. </p> <p>The roasting of meat in front of a starving person is little different from the current expansion of huge new illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land, areas green from expropriated water, while Arab crops die of thirst. These settlements sit above the Palestinian refugee camps and towns, each cut off from the other by checkpoints, curfews and closures - with jobs lost, and soaring new levels of poverty and malnutrition that have shocked the already exhausted humanitarian agencies in recent months. The prison system is no different for Palestinians who are trapped just a few miles north of Israel. In south Lebanon, at Rashidyeh refugee camp, a lively group of young women told me a few weeks ago: \"When we leave school, there are no professions open to us here [more than 72 professions in Lebanon are denied to Palestinian refugees], we are prevented from going home, we have no travel documents, we cannot study at the university here. Our lives are over, we can't even leave the camp.\" </p> <p>This is, perhaps, the most difficult moment that Palestinians have had to face. It is essential for those who care for peace and justice to show solidarity at this time with our struggle for emancipation. It is the moment to speak up, to remind those in power that until Palestine is free, citizens all over the world are not living in democracies either. It is the moment to make direct and practical gestures of support and to connect with those holding fast to their dignity. </p> <p>The Palestinians themselves are not passive - they are striking, which is an act of hope and of courage. To write directly to them, to demonstrate, to get busy organising relief and aid for them, to campaign on their behalf until this dark moment has passed, means that solitary confinement will be felt only by those who are oppressing them. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Karma Nabulsi is a research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford and the author of Traditions of War: Occupation, Resistance and the Law </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:director.civitas@nuf.ox.ac.uk\">director.civitas@nuf.ox.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "Almost everything is conspiring against Jean MacColl's campaign for justice, four years after her daughter, the singer-songwriter Kirsty, was mown down by a motorboat while diving in Mexico. <p>The man who was convicted of wrongful killing, a young employee of a Mexican supermarket magnate, was probably not behind the wheel of the speedboat at the time. </p> <p>At any rate he avoided prison by paying one peso for each day of his two years and 10 months term - which amounted to a \u00a361 fine and damages of \u00a31,250. Local authorities closed the case last year, and a federal prosecutor rejected Mrs MacColl's request to bring it under federal jurisdiction. </p> <p>The 81-year-old former dancer and choreographer admits the odds are not in her favour. \"It's one step forward, two steps back. We are going to carry on fighting until we win,\" Mrs MacColl said in London. \"We are fighting impunity and corruption.\" </p> <p>The Justice for Kirsty campaign is pinning its hopes on new evidence it claims to have found that will be revealed in a documentary to be shown in the Edinburgh TV festival today. </p> <p>At the time of her death Kirsty MacColl, best known for the 80s hits There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis and her gritty duet Fairytale of New York with Shane MacGowan, was enjoying critical acclaim for her Latin-inspired new album Tropical Brainstorm. </p> <p>She was on holiday on the island of Cozumel, just off Mexico's Yucatan's peninsula, with her two teenage sons after completing a radio series on Cuban music. </p> <p>The 41-year-old singer set out at midday on December 18, 2000 for a part of the Chankanaab reef favoured by local diving instructors as an easy and spectacular introduction for novice divers like her children. </p> <p>Ivan Diaz, their experienced dive master, said they had just surfaced when the speedboat Percalito bore down on the group. </p> <p>\"Out of the corner of my eye I saw the boat coming directly towards us very fast. I realised that it wasn't going to change course and was going to run us over,\" Mr. Diaz said. \"I heard a thump and a crack and then I saw the stain of blood spreading out in the water. It was Kirsty's blood.\" </p> <p>MacColl was almost sliced in two by Percalito's propeller, dying instantly, after pushing her eldest son Jaime out of the way. He suffered minor injuries. Mr Diaz got himself and her youngest son Louis to safety unhurt. </p> <p>The Mexican supermarket chain owner Guillermo Gonzalez Nova, two sons, a daughter-in-law, her baby and a young employee called Juan Jose Cem Yam were on the boat. Mr Gonzalez Nova is the chairman of Mexico's second-largest retailing group. </p> <p>Cem Yam confessed to being behind the wheel despite having no licence or boating experience. In March 2003 he was convicted of wrongful killing and sentenced to two years and 10 months, which he avoided by buying himself out of jail. The fine he paid was set low because of his clean record and low salary. </p> <p>Mrs McColl hired a private investigator, and according to the documentary he discovered that Percalito was travelling at several times the speed limit in a restricted area of the marine park, and that Cem Yam was not at the controls. </p> <p>If this is true, either Mr Gonzalez Nova or a member of his family was at the wheel. In addition the family's claim that the boat was in open water and travelling at only four knots must have been false. </p> <p>The divemaster Mr Diaz said he saw Cem Yam at the back of the boat. The documentary claims that other potential witnesses were either not called to court or were too frightened of giving evidence against a powerful family with a holiday home on the island. </p> <p>If Cem Yam is innocent, it would not be the first time in Mexico that the poor and powerless have been held responsible for actions of others. </p> <p>\"It is very common for an employee to be made a scapegoat in a case involving an important family, particularly in the provinces,\" said Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a criminologist who added that the rise of human rights groups has begun to attack this phenomenon. </p> <p>Mrs MacColl's Mexican lawyer, Demetrio Guerra, insists there is no question but that the investigation was plagued by negligence. The only hope of a retrial, he says, is to get the case admitted to federal jurisdiction on the grounds that the accident took place in federal waters. </p> <p>None of this deters Mrs MacColl. \"Kirsty was not a pop star in the sense of all the razzmatazz that usually goes with that,\" she said. \"She was so honest and open and down to earth and generous of heart. She fought injustice in her way and that's what I am trying to do for her.\"</p>",
  "Six Cubans trying to reach Mexico spent two months at sea, mostly on a nine-metre boat, before landing on Mustang Island on the Texas coast, US Customs and Border Protection officials said on Thursday. <p>Five men were treated and released from hospital early on Thursday, a day after they were found on the beach. The sixth person, a woman, remained in hospital in a stable condition. </p> <p>\"They were somewhat malnourished and dehydrated,\" a spokesman for the agency said. </p> <p>After being processed by the Border Patrol and having hearing dates set, the men were released to relatives from Dallas or put on a bus to join relatives in Miami, Border Patrol agent Felix Cantu said. </p> <p>Mr Cantu said the six left Manzanillo, Cuba, on a raft on June 25. He said they bought their boat, water and fuel in the Cayman Islands five days later. </p> <p>He said Hurricane Charley and Tropical Storm Bonnie probably blew their boat off course.</p>",
  "<p>What is your \"spending profile\"? Do you shop at a limited range of stores and mostly near to home? Then you could be shocked if you spend outside your \"profile\". Your debit or credit card could be rejected, leaving you red-faced, as banks use ever more sophisticated techniques to catch fraudsters. </p> <p>I recently ordered a new bathroom suite over the phone and was sorely embarrassed when the sales assistant informed me, \"unfortunately your debit card has been declined\". </p> <p>My instant reaction, I'm afraid, was to accuse my husband of forgetting to transfer the required \u00a32,300 from our savings into our joint current account as promised. Not so, retorted my offended spouse. He had in fact played safe by transferring \u00a34,000. He made a highly indignant call to the bank, Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>The reason my debit card payment had been declined, explained the bank, was that the transaction had been picked up by its computerised fraud detection system as being unusual and outside the normal pattern of spending on our account. </p> <p>Once the bank had verification that we were who we said we were and not card thieves out to bag ourselves a free bathroom, the stop on the payment was lifted. </p> <p>But, given the embarrassment and time-wasting hassle involved, I was still miffed at Lloyds TSB. Did this mean I needed to inform them each time I was going to spend bit more of my money than usual? And should I tell them if I planned to use my card abroad, for example, if I wanted to avoid washing dishes as a method of supper payment? </p> <p>Now, though, having spoken to several major banks about the murky world of card fraud and the all-singing, all-dancing systems they use to check for sudden and unusual spending habits, I feel more mellow. </p> <p>These \"neural network\" fraud detection systems with names like Falcon and Iris do sound clever. \"They are intelligent systems which learn as they go. They keep one eye on the customer's spending and transaction pattern and one eye on spending patterns typically used by card fraudsters,\" explains a spokeswoman for Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>By marrying up all the variables the system can then detect suspicious transactions that may be fraudulent and need checking before they are given the go-ahead. </p> <p>When a customer is present with their debit card and the transaction is flagged up in this way, the retailer will get a message at the point of sale saying: \"refer to bank for authorisation\". </p> <p>The onus is then on the retailer to call the card issuer, who will speak to the customer to verify their identity. In reality, though, many shop assistants (especially if there's a queue) simply ask for an alternative card, and misinform the customer that their card has been rejected. </p> <p>An HSBC spokeswoman says: \"We have worked closely with other banks and merchants to make it as quick for the customer as possible and to put them to the least inconvenience. We will ask the customer random security questions. </p> <p>\"The whole process should take a matter of a few minutes. Once the check is complete, provided that all the answers are correct the transaction will be processed as normal and the customer can carry on with their day.\" </p> <p>The banks say that customers are not generally put out by such checks once they realise that they form part of the fight against card fraud. \"In an ideal world you wouldn't need these fraud detection systems and the inconvenience they can cause,\" says a spokesman for Barclays. \"But back in the real world, the checks mean less hassle all around and less money going into fraudsters' pockets. </p> <p>\"Customers need to understand that they are nothing to do with your creditworthiness and no reflection on the funds in your account. They are carried out simply because we are trying to stop other people spending your money.\" </p> <p>And the technique is very successful, Barclays adds. \"For every 10 accounts we have a referral on, one of them turns out to be fraudulent. Given the one million transactions a day, that's a lot of fraud being stopped.\" </p> <p>Identity checks are not so straightforward where you are buying something over the phone, by mail order or online. Operators like Visa therefore rule that banks can only accept or decline payments made in this way - they cannot refer them for authorisation. </p> <p>Faced with a card-not-present transaction flagged up as unusual or suspicious, most banks, including Lloyds TSB, Barclays and NatWest, say they will decline the payment. They'll then try to contact the customer quickly to carry out identity checks and make sure the transaction is genuine. </p> <p>\"One key thing customers can do to avoid delays and problems is to make sure their bank has up-to-date contact details for them, including mobile numbers,\" says a NatWest spokesman. </p> <p>Many customers beat them to it and contact the bank themselves. So it's worth keeping your bank's contact details to hand. </p> <p>However, it seems that one bank's customers don't need to worry about being left red-faced. A Halifax spokesman says: \"In cases like yours where a card-not-present transaction is flagged as unusual, we allow that payment to go through so that the customer is not inconvenienced. </p> <p>\"Then we contact the customer immediately to check the transaction was legitimate. If not, we will freeze the card and advise the retailer not to send out the goods. </p> <p>\"If we can't get hold of the customer, we will monitor the next transaction on the card and, if that is suspicious, we freeze the account and stop all payments. It's important to stress that in neither case will the customer be liable for fraudulent losses.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dr S's receptionist moves with an aloof, feline grace down the hall. I follow in her wake of Opium, feeling clumsy and inferior. At the examining room door, she turns to gesture me inside. Alone in the small room, I slip the paper smock over my clothes and struggle to fit my long hair into the paper cap. I can hear the blood pounding in my ears. I shift uncomfortably on the narrow exam table. How much longer? Five minutes? Fifteen? </p> <p>Then, miraculously, the door clicks open and Dr S enters the room, a tall, good-looking man of about 45, as handsome a deity as any Hollywood casting director could have dreamed up, wearing surgical scrubs which are somewhat rumpled and specked ever so slightly with traces of rusty blood. </p> <p>\"Hope! My dear, good morning. How are you?\" </p> <p>\"Fine,\" I say, which now that he's here is less of a lie. </p> <p>Dr S approaches me, standing so close I can smell the piney cologne rising off his warm skin. His brows knit together as he studies the bump on my lower lip, a flaw which I know is jarringly obvious in spite of my careful application of flesh-toned lipstick. \"We're going to fix this today.\" He presses the bump and I wince, not only because it hurts, but because I need to see the tender regret in his eyes at having caused me pain. \"Sorry. I've got to check a post-op patient, and then we'll begin. It will only be a few more minutes.\" </p> <p>When the door closes behind him, I feel I'll jump out of my skin. For the first time, the reality of the procedure hits me: it will hurt what he's going to do; how could it not? As if the painful bump and my pounding fear are not enough, the familiar blaming refrain descends upon me like a hammer - this is all your fault. You brought this on yourself. It is your punishment for wanting something so frivolous, so silly and wasteful. You vain, selfish fool. </p> <p>When the door clicks open again, my heart gives a bleat of joy. But it is only the nurse, come to lead me to the operating room. </p> <p>\"Hope.\" Dr S stands at the door. \"Before we begin, there's something I want to show you. Come in.\" </p> <p>To my surprise there is a woman on the operating table. She is dark-haired, doe-eyed, perhaps 40. Her body is draped in a white blanket. She blinks at me and smiles sleepily. \"This is Alix,\" Dr S says. </p> <p>On the white paper sheet beneath her head are half a dozen or so nickel-sized reddish blotches, where blood from an unseen wound had dripped. </p> <p>\"Alix just had what I like to call a 'lunchtime lift'. Have you heard of it? It's revolutionary,\" he says. \"State of the art. It gives the effect of a brow lift without any of the downtime.\" There's a surge of bravado in Dr S's voice; the voice of a showman, a salesman? I have no interest in a brow lift, so I do not know how to react. Dr S approaches the woman on the table, pressing one of her manicured hands in his own. \"Come closer, Hope,\" he scolds gently. \"Don't be shy.\" </p> <p>I feel a tinge of annoyance: this is supposed to be my surgery, my moment. Alix turns towards Dr S and smiles up at him; the look of trust and intimacy they exchange makes my throat ache with longing. </p> <p>\"Just look at her,\" Dr S says, his eyes still fixed on Alix. \"Isn't she lovely? She looks 25 years old.\" </p> <p>My smile, automatic, hides my confusion. I myself am only 23. </p> <p>\"You could benefit from this, too, Hope.\" Dr S returns the full wattage of his gaze on me. \"You're very girl-next-door, and this would give you an exotic, sort of foreign look. Here, let me show you.\" </p> <p>Exotic. Foreign. How can I resist a delicious, illicit offer to become someone I am not? Does Dr S see inside me, does he know that, if I could, I would shed my face and body, my very self, on his table as nimbly as a snake sheds its skin, in favour of becoming a beautiful stranger? Almost somnambulant, I allow Dr S to position me in front of an oval mirror on the wall. He stands behind me, putting his fingers on my temples, pulling the skin back and upward. \"Look,\" he says. His voice is low and so near my ear that the little hairs on my neck rise. The change in me, though subtle, is startling. My round, green eyes are now slightly uptilted, catlike, the eyes of an Italian movie star. I want what I see in the mirror, impulsively and fervently. </p> <p>\"If you do it today,\" Dr S says softly, \"at the same time as your lip, I'll only charge you one thousand. Usually I charge $1,600. I always give a break on multiple procedures.\" </p> <p>A beat passes. When I don't respond, he says, \"If you like, Alana can just throw it on your credit card.\" </p> <p>Of the three plastic surgeons I've been to, Dr S was the first who did not raise his eyebrows upon noticing my age on my chart. He did not fix me with a quizzical look as I ticked off the procedures I'd already had. Lips. Nose. Cheekbones. Lips again. From that first consultation, I could see that, with Dr S, nothing I asked for would be off-limits. It thrills me, the dizzy possibility of it. But it frightens me, too. Without the brakes of someone else's disapproval, real or imagined, to slow me, what procedures will I not undertake? How far will I go? </p> <p>\"What do you say, Hope?\" </p> <p>To refuse requires more assertiveness than I can muster. The stakes seem enormous: to risk losing Dr S's favour; to languish for ever in dreary girl-next-doordom. \"No!\" I cry. </p> <p>\"What?\" Dr S's brown eyes are round with surprise. </p> <p>\"I mean, yes! Sorry. I meant yes. Let's do it.\" Dr S's approving smile warms me like a rush of love. </p> <p>I recline on the operating table, giving myself up to the sterile ministrations of the nurse. It is to be a local anaesthetic. Dr S leans over me holding a large syringe. With my face tilted towards his, he could almost be leaning in for a kiss. </p> <p>Numb now, my lip feels thick as bread dough. The nurse dabs at my mouth with a square of white gauze, which comes away livid with my blood. I close my eyes. Vivaldi soars on the stereo. Dr S's hands on my face are cool and dry in their latex gloves. I am safe now. </p> <p>\"This is the thing the other guy is terrified of doing.\" He means the other surgeon, Dr R, who inserted the strip of Gore-Tex that is now pushing its way out of my lower lip. Gore-Tex is a synthetic material commonly used to insulate winter coats. It was supposed to give my lip a luscious, full look. But instead of a pretty pout, I got this unsightly, infected lump. A cyst, I told my roommates. </p> <p>\"Doctor,\" I say, a whisper, a slurred prayer. \"If there was an earthquake right now, and the power went out ... \" </p> <p>\"What would happen to you?\" Dr S finishes my thought. \"I wouldn't leave you.\" </p> <p>I wouldn't leave you. This is what I needed so much to know. If the ceiling collapsed, if he were hurt, if he had to stagger to attend my supine body, he would. Is this what love feels like, I wonder. </p> <p>My eyes flicker lazily. There is a small metal table beside me, a few inches from my face. Atop it, I see several bloody surgical tools. Casually, I regard my own blood, unmoved. But what is that other thing, that narrow strip of pale skin from which sprouts short, stiff brownish hairs like a squirrel's? What is this bit of roadkill on the surgical tray? </p> <p>My eyes strain to see the floor below. There, on the white linoleum, strands of my own long hair lie splayed in a messy heap. With a jolt it hits me. My skin. My hair. My own severed flesh on the tray. </p> <p>My breathing seems to halt. Calm, I tell myself, calm, calm. Breathe. Don't have a panic attack now. What's done is done. </p> <p>\"Are you all right?\" Dr S asks. </p> <p>\"Yes.\" It shocks me that I can feel such terror and speak so offhandedly. \"It's just that I'm staring at a chunk of my scalp on your table.\" </p> <p>After a beat, Dr S seems to register what I've said. His staccato laugh pipes out. \"Did you hear that, Jeanne?\" he says to his nurse. \"A chunk of her scalp. Beautiful and funny! I like that.\" </p> <p>His laughter washes over me. Beautiful. He thinks I'm beautiful. I close my eyes, trying to recapture the feeling of ecstatic surrender. I tell myself, you are the straw that he will spin into gold. </p> <p>I almost believe it. </p> <p>The heavy click of the deadbolt reassures me as I turn my key in the lock that my roommates are not home. As I'd hoped, the apartment is silent and still. I moved into the apartment from my parents' house a few months ago, after my fourth surgery, when my mother told me that she would not allow her daughter's \"self-mutilation\" to occur under her roof. </p> <p>My mother always performed best in her maternal role when there was something wrong with me. Whether it be a bad haircut or a cold, she became an engine of motherly concern. She would bring me magazines, soup; she brushed my hair; she hovered. Healthy and robust, I became somehow frightening. Damaged, I was a bird she could fold under her wing. But this was different. A case of the sniffles, a too-short fringe, or a lousy boyfriend were manageable ailments. This time, I had damaged the part of myself she both worshipped and feared: my appearance. </p> <p>I have heard that mother birds sometimes push their young out of the nest if they are sickly or deformed. As for my mother, she took one look at her disfigured offspring and fled the nest herself. She checked into the Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Rey and called my father with explicit instructions that she would not come home until I was gone. </p> <p>And so I found myself in this apartment, the fourth in a quartet of roommates, all single young women in their mid-20s. Every morning I lie in bed and listen to the three of them getting ready for work, for school, for whatever business or engagements their day may hold. Showers run; coffee perks. I listen to their preparations with a sense of wonder. How are they able to go out into the world each day, fresh and full of energy? How is it that I have lost the knack for everyday life? I can't imagine going to a job, even looking for a job. </p> <p>I had drifted in and out of graduate school the same way I drifted everywhere in my life. I had long ago lost interest in academic subjects, my early talent for creative writing eclipsed by my intense fixation on my appearance. My roommates must wonder about me, the new girl, who mysteriously doesn't work and whose days are unaccounted for. I'm polite, evasive, elusive. I prefer to remain anonymous. </p> <p>Now, in my bedroom, I catch my reflection in one of the mirrors on my wall. I'm startled, for a moment, at my uplifted eyes. I get up close to the mirror now, turn my face from side to side. I like my new eyes, I decide. They do look somewhat exotic; they will look even more so with dark make-up, perhaps some kohl liner. I will experiment, play with them as with a new toy; it will keep me busy for a while. </p> <p>My father's parents, Clayton and Eleanor Hathaway, were not the richest people in Hancock Park. There were the Van de Kamps and the Ahmansons and the Bannings. But my grandfather was revered because he handled something of utmost importance to them: he delivered their babies. My father's younger sister, Diane, still lived in her girlhood bedroom on the second floor. Diane suffered from an array of vague but never-ending physical ailments: stomach distress, fatigue, lightheadedness. </p> <p>My mother said the Hathaways didn't like her because she wasn't a society girl. But I suspected my mother needed to be fussed over to feel important, and the Hathaways were far too refined for fussing. Any excess of emotion had been bred out of them, like an overbright colour dulled by many washings. My father's family, too, had a certain established order. Each of us had a title and a role. My mother was the rogue. My grandmother was the genteel gentlewoman. My father was the good-natured goof. I was the pretty one. </p> <p>My mother's desire for me to be glamorous, stunning and charming - to dazzle my father's family - added to the pressure I already heaped upon myself. </p> <p>Snapshot: a sunny Sunday afternoon, my senior year of high school. No picture was taken on that day, but if it had been it would look like this: the three of us, my mother, my father and I, a perfect family trio, enjoying the day by our pool in Hancock Park. </p> <p>My mother is stretched out on the sun-warmed deck near the shallow end; I am lying on my stomach on a chaise longue at the other end of the pool. My father swims laps. Both my mother and I wear bikinis. I reach back and undo the clasp of my bikini top to tan my back. Relaxing under the molten heat of the sun, I close my eyes. </p> <p>My father finishes swimming his laps and gets out of the pool, hopping from foot to foot to shake the water from his ears. My father at 40 is a good-looking man. He has aged better than my mother. Whereas in youth he was scrawny and gangly, with age he has filled out into a broad-shouldered, well-built man, with a thick head of wavy, dark hair and blue eyes. He spreads his towel on the other chaise, beside mine; the lounger creaks under his weight as he flops on to it. I raise my head slightly, open one eye to smile at him. But he isn't looking at me. He is looking across the pool at my mother, who has abruptly got up, and is striding into the house without a word. Just before she steps through the door, she gives him a look of such mysterious searing intensity that I shiver under the hot sun. </p> <p>\"What's with her?\" I say, trying to be jokey, to make light of what I want to assume is just another of her mood swings. </p> <p>My father stares at the place where my mother had been as if she is still there. Something has changed, minutely, in the air between us. He says, in a stilted voice, \"I think I'll go in.\" </p> <p>My parents fight over the most trivial things; my mother's anger and unhappiness bubble up often and unexpectedly, like dinosaur bones in the nearby La Brea tar pits. I continue to lie outside by the pool, though my heart beats more rapidly now. Finally, I gather up my towel and go inside. </p> <p>Something is wrong. I feel it right away; my mother's rage hangs in the air like the stench of something rotten. Down the hall, from behind their door, I can hear my parents' animated voices. My father's, low and strained, is pleading, my mother's shrill and furious. </p> <p>Don't listen, I tell myself. I turn on the shower, one hand testing the water's temperature. There is a towel hanging on my bathroom door, but I tell myself I want a fresh one. Halfway down the hall to the linen closet, I freeze. My mother is screaming. \"What the hell is going on between you two?\" she shrieks. \"Why did you sit next to her? Tempting you, in that little bikini! I know exactly what she's doing, and I know what you're thinking, don't think I don't!\" </p> <p>I know it, I knew it, yet still it takes a moment to realise: she is talking about me. I look down at my breasts in the bikini top, the flat terrain of my belly, and freeze with terror. Dear God. </p> <p>I cannot hear my father's panicked, protesting response. Whatever he says only seems to inflame my mother further. </p> <p>\"You're attracted to her, aren't you?\" she wails. \"Admit it! She's young and beautiful, and I'm not! I'm not an idiot, you know. Don't think I can't see what's going on here, right under my fucking nose!\" </p> <p>\"I didn't sit by her, Virginia.\" My father's words are calm, measured and perfectly clear. Does he know he's lying, or is sitting by me simply not worth defending? I want to barge into their room, smack him, to shake him until he acknowledges me. I'm your daughter, for Christ's sake! What is wrong with sitting next to your own daughter! </p> <p>I slink back down the hall to my bathroom. I peel off my bikini, avoiding the sight of myself in the mirror. I turn on the water, so hot I can hardly bear it. I push my face into the scalding spray, willing it to burn away what I've just heard, to sear the pain that has opened up inside me. </p> <p>When I can't sleep, when there aren't any new magazines to distract me, when I can't possibly find another excuse to visit Dr S's office, these are the days when despair settles into my body like fever, making my bones ache. It is a misconception, the idea that depression is all in the head. I rush back and forth to the mirror, checking, always checking; for what? I'll think, what if I had bigger lips? I'll think about this for a while, play with the idea. What if I had bigger lips and a smaller nose? What would it take for me to be satisfied with my appearance? Answer: everything. Nothing. Nothing and everything. The riddle I am really trying to solve is: what will it take to make me happy? </p> <p>Mirror, mirror, on the wall, I just need larger breasts, that's all! Just this one little improvement and - happiness! Yes! Bigger breasts! All those other nagging, painful thoughts are eclipsed. All I can think about is how much better I'll look and how much more confident I'll feel with this thing, this change I want to make. </p> <p>Maybe, if I weren't so vain and squeamish, my obsession would have taken a more predictable form. I would stick a finger down my throat or dig a razor blade into my arm. Or step on the scale 50 times a day, count every calorie. Wouldn't all of these achieve the same purpose? Yes, but then again my fascination with plastic surgery feels so right. It is the perfect modern-day affliction for a poor little rich girl like myself. How appropriate that a Hathaway should choose a route to self-annihilation that is elaborate, expensive and essentially passive. I'm not brave enough to carve myself up in private; I've got to pay someone else to do it. </p> <p>What if I had bigger breasts? </p> <p>After the initial thought, obsession begins to take over. I am compelled to go through with it. It becomes a personal mission, a test of my resolve. </p> <p>I'm at Dr S's surgery; he sits down on a little stool beside me, and my heart lurches. </p> <p>\"Doctor!\" That word. \"I was thinking about breast surgery.\" The words spill out of my mouth in a breathless rush, like a sob. \"What do you think?\" </p> <p>Dr S gives me his full attention. \"Larger or smaller?\" he asks. </p> <p>His question startles me. Isn't it obvious? \"Larger.\" </p> <p>Dr S's face lights up. \"Breasts are my speciality,\" he says. \"Take off your shirt. Let's see what we have.\" I shed my shirt and bra, utterly unselfconscious. His eyes on my naked skin raise goosebumps along my arms and stomach. I put my arms at my sides, my exposed breasts like offerings. Dr S nods his head, looking slowly from one breast to the other. He reaches out to cup each breast in his hand, as if weighing it in his palm. It is all I can do not to cry out. </p> <p>\"The right one is a little bigger than the left,\" he says. \"But on the whole, you've got very nice breasts.\" </p> <p>I feel deflated. How can he not feel the heat, the intimacy of this moment? </p> <p>\"After the surgery, though, you'll have traffic-stopping breasts.\" </p> <p>After the surgery? I think, startled. I haven't decided yet. </p> <p>\"Your skin has wonderful elasticity.\" Dr S's voice is husky, but for me the moment is lost. \"You're very lucky, Hope. With your young skin and your frame, you can carry off a very large implant.\" </p> <p>\"I don't know if I would want very large breasts. The thing is ... I, uh ... I really haven't given it enough thought. I have to think about it.\" </p> <p>Disappointment - or is it some darker emotion? - clouds Dr S's face. \"Take your time,\" he says unconvincingly. He is poised at the door. He has other patients waiting to see him. Patients quicker to make a decision than me. I cannot take up any more of his time. \"Let me know what you decide,\" he says. </p> <p>I read this about suicidal people: sometimes, they decide finally to go through with it simply because they can't stand that little voice in their head any more telling them to do it, do it. They just want to stop the noise. The same is true for other compulsives. Self-mutilators, hair pullers: sooner or later, they give in to that little nagging voice. </p> <p>Do it, do it, do it . I can't tell any more if I really want bigger breasts, or if I simply want to stop obsessing about them. I stop by Dr S's office and ask his assistant to schedule the surgery. </p> <p>Four weeks later I feel as if there is a truck parked on my chest. I can't turn or breathe deeply or cry. I don't want to move from my bed. Once the morphine wears off, knives stab at my chest. Rolling over is out of the question. The exertion of getting up and taking a few steps makes me pant and weep with agony. </p> <p>It is April Fools' Day, and I have new breasts. </p> <p>Time passes, the pain eases but I am nearly broke. I need money. I tell myself that this is why I answer the ad, in the classified section of a local newspaper. The ad says, in bold letters: figure models wanted, no experience, fast $$$. I keep the ad for a week or so before answering it. I like the sound of it: Figure Modelling. It has a nice, artsy ring to it. Like something out of Degas. Of course, a part of me knows that it isn't going to be this innocent. Especially when the ad is placed alongside those advertising escort services, sensual massage, and phone-sex lines. I know I will not be posing chastely for a master drawing class. I know, too, that the reason I am answering the ad is not entirely because I am broke. </p> <p>It has come down to this. I am so caught up in my physical self that I believe it is all I have to offer, all that I am. I cannot fool myself any more that I am improving my life, that I am on a path to something significant, that Dr S will love me. </p> <p>There is no misery like the misery of being trapped in your own brain. The more I think about my problems, the more tied up in knots I become. I do not want to be alone, or pretend that I am not lonely. I don't want to pretend at all. I want connection and excitement and meaning. I looked for those things in Dr S's office and, for a time, I thought I found them there. A long, long time ago something important inside me got crushed, and that little wounded thing is still in there, tiny, afraid to unfold itself. I can't do this any more. </p> <p>I realise I need help </p> <p>\u00a9 Hope Donahue, 2004 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hope Donahue was diagnosed as having obsessive-compulsive disorder.

  "A human rights group yesterday published a detailed list of the locations of what it claimed were 16 bases in Sudan being used by the Janjaweed militia that is largely responsible for the Darfur crisis. <p>Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the African division of Human Rights Watch, said: \"The existence of these Janjaweed camps shows clearly that Khartoum is not at all serious about ending atrocities and providing security.\" </p> <p>Human Rights Watch said the Sudanese government was not only permitting the bases to exist, but in some cases the Sudanese army was sharing the camps with the Janjaweed. </p> <p>The Sudanese government promised the UN on July 3 that it would rein in the Janjaweed, which it has armed and supported. A UN security council resolution gave it until next Monday to do so. </p> <p>More than 1.2 million people have fled their homes in the Darfur region, mainly out of fear of the Janjaweed. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch, which drew up the map of the camps based on statements from refugees, said at least three new bases had been built since Sudan made its promise. </p> <p>The camps, which it said opened in July, were in Assalaya, (housing both Janjaweed and Sudanese forces), Razallah Jawazat, and Taisha. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch claimed that in total, five of the 16 camps were shared by Sudanese forces and the Janjaweed. Several were just a few miles from refugee camps, allowing the Janjaweed to continue their campaign of terror. It said the bases must be put under guard and disbanded. </p> <p>The UN envoy to the Sudan, Jan Pronk, was in Darfur yesterday before briefing the UN next week. He is expected to report that while the Sudanese government has lifted many of the obstructions to the aid effort, it has not done enough to ensure civilian security. </p> <p>After such an assessment, the security council would be likely to hold back on sanctions, to see whether the Sudanese government ends operations by its own forces against civilians in Darfur, and disarms the Janjaweed. </p> <p>Mr Pronk yesterday attended a ceremony in the west of the region in which 500 militia members supported by the Sudanese government handed in weapons. They insisted they were not members of the Janjaweed. </p> <p>Sudan's minister for humanitarian affairs, Ibrahim Hamid, who is travelling with the UN delegation, said: \"The security situation has improved greatly.\" </p> <p>The Foreign Office says there is no evidence that Sudanese forces have been engaged in actions in Darfur since July. </p> <p>Representatives of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have been denied visas to go to Sudan, but the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, who visited Darfur this week, said he had obtained permission for them to visit. Leslie Lefkow, a worker with Human Rights Watch, said yesterday that she was still waiting for permission.</p>",
  "Simon Mann, the leader of the failed Equatorial Guinea coup attempt that led to the arrest of Sir Mark Thatcher, was last night facing up to 10 years in jail after being found guilty of attempting to possess dangerous weapons by a court in Zimbabwe. <p>The Old Etonian and former SAS officer, who was arrested on the tarmac at Harare airport in March along with a plane full of mercenaries while waiting for a delivery of weapons, will be sentenced next month. </p> <p>The latest twist in the saga comes at the end of an extraordinary week in which the attempted coup in a forgotten but oil rich corner of West Africa has sucked in several establishment figures and a rightwing coterie of businessmen, including Sir Mark, oil millionaire Ely Calil and Lord Archer. </p> <p>A magistrate sitting at a makeshift courthouse in the Harare maximum security Chikurubi prison, found 66 of the mercenaries, all travelling on South African passports, not guilty of the weapons offences. Charges had already been dropped against another three. </p> <p>Most of the men held in Zimbabwe had already pleaded guilty last month to lesser charges of violating Zimbabwe's immigration and civil aviation laws, carrying a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a fine. </p> <p>Prosecutors said Equatorial Guinea's Spanish-based opposition leader, Severo Moto, offered the group $1.8m and oil rights to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema. </p> <p>Mann admitted trying to order assault rifles, grenades, anti-tank rocket launchers and other weapons from Zimbabwe Defence Industries, but magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe said prosecutors failed to prove their case against the 64 other men arrested when their ageing Boeing 727 landed at Harare International Airport on March 7, and two already in Zimbabwe with Mann at the time. </p> <p>He also acquitted Mann of an additional charge of taking possession of the weapons. The men, including Mann, maintain they were en route to jobs protecting a mining operation in wartorn eastern Congo. </p> <p>Fifteen other suspected mercenaries, including South African businessman Nick du Toit who has admitted to giving logistical support to the coup attempt, are on trial in Equatorial Guinea, Africa's third-largest oil producer. They face the death penalty if convicted. </p> <p>Yesterday Sir Mark, who denies any involvement in the coup attempt, remained under house arrest at his home in Constantia, the upmarket Cape Town suburb where Mann also has a home. </p> <p>Lady Thatcher's son was charged with helping to fund the coup attempt after a dawn raid by the Scorpions, an elite police squad which has been investigating links between Mann and several high profile businessmen. </p> <p>The former prime minister, surrounded by at least five armed bodyguards, refused to comment on the affair as she entered her central London home after flying in from the United States. But she is said to be distressed by her son's arrest. </p> <p>The South African government said yesterday it was considering a request from Equatorial Guinea for investigators to be allowed to travel to Cape Town to interview Sir Mark over the coup attempt. However there has been no request for extradition, something that is thought highly unlikely because the countries have no extradition treaty and because Equatorial Guinea practises the death penalty. </p> <p>The Scorpions, who arrested Sir Mark because they feared he was about to flee the country, are understood to be investigating the whereabouts of a private plane they believe he owned, as well as several trips he allegedly made to Zimbabwe. </p> <p>His spokesman in London, Lord Bell, said he been dragged into the Equatorial Guinea affair because of \"guilt by association\". </p> <p>\"Mark Thatcher and Simon Mann were friends, nobody has ever denied that,\" he said. \"But it doesn't follow that because you are friends with someone you are necessarily involved in what they are doing.\" </p> <p>Mann, who owns a large house on the banks of the Solent in Hamphire, is a scion of the Watney's brewing empire and went to Eton and Sandhurst before becoming an officer in the SAS. Part thrill-seeker, part businessman, he left the army in the early 1980s, moving into the security and mercenary business. He set up Executive Outcomes with the controversial entrepreneur Tony Buckingham, making a fortune protecting oil installations from rebels in Angola's civil war. </p> <p>In 1995 he became involved in an offshoot, Sandline International, with ex-Scots Guard Lt-Col Tim Spicer, and shipped arms to Sierra Leone in contravention of a UN embargo. </p> <p>A father of six - three with his present wife Amanda - Mann has been in solitary confinement in Chikurubi prison since his arrest in March. Bespectacled and clad in Zimbabwe's thin, prison-issue khaki shirt and shorts, he no longer appears the dashing man of action that his life story would suggest. </p> <p>His lawyers claim he has been tortured, assaulted by prison officers, suffered lice, inedible food and general deprivation. </p> <p>\"Our situation is not good and it is very URGENT,\" Mann wrote to his wife and lawyers in a letter smuggled out of the jail but intercepted by South African intelligence at the end of March. \"It may be that getting us out comes down to a large splodge of wonga! Of course investors did not think this would happen. Did !?\" </p> <p>The letter then went on to refer to \"Scratcher\" - a nickname given to Mark Thatcher at Harrow because he had acne. </p> <p>Jeffrey Archer, the disgraced peer and former Tory deputy chairman, is alleged to have paid Mann \u00a380,000, but he has denied knowledge of any coup plot. </p> <p>Yesterday friends of James Kershaw, the man named as the coup accountant who had allegedly handed the \"Wonga list\" - those who invested in the coup plot - over to the South African authorities, denied reports that he was in hiding under witness protection. </p> <p>They say he went to see the South African authorities shortly after the coup attempt and gave a detailed statement. </p> <p>Another businessman facing questions about his involvement in the coup plot is Nigel Morgan, a former guards officer and long standing friend of the Thatcher family, who was one of the addressees on the plea for help letter Mann wrote from his prison cell. Mr Morgan had employed Mr Kershaw as an IT expert and accountant at the Miba diamond mine in Congo where he was in charge of security until last year. </p> <p>Asked yesterday by the Guardian whether he was involved in the coup plot he said: \"I am not going to comment. I don't think it will help Simon and I don't think it will help Mark.\" Asked whether, like Mr Kershaw, he had given evidence to the South African authorities he refused to comment saying: \"The status of that is unclear.\"</p> <p> <b>Timeline</b></p> <p><b>March 7</b> Zimbabwe seizes a US-registered cargo plane carrying 64 suspected mercenaries and military equipment.

  "<p>More than 80,000 rock fans are converging on Berkshire for the Reading Festival this weekend - but 18-year-old Robby Green won't be among them. He coughed up more than \u00a3600 for four tickets but has been left out of pocket and ticketless after being fleeced by an eBay conman. </p> <p>The three-day \"Carling Weekend Reading Festival\" kicked off yesterday and is being headlined by The Darkness, The White Stripes and Green Day. Robby was particularly looking forward to catching former Blur guitarist Graham Coxon and a rejuvenated Morrissey, but fell victim to a fraudulent trader on the online auction site. </p> <p>His tale of woe illustrates that there are risks attached to using online auctions. For example, the maximum you can recover through eBay's standard purchase protection programme is \u00a3105. </p> <p>Robby and three friends turned to eBay after three-day tickets for Reading sold out much more quickly than expected. They won an auction for four tickets with a bid of \u00a3623, and after making contact with the seller, Robby sent off his cheque. </p> <p>But the tickets never arrived and all attempts to contact the seller proved fruitless. </p> <p>The seller's eBay account is no longer active, he hasn't responded to emails, his mobile phone just directs callers to a full mailbox, and directory enquiries didn't yield a home number - though they have got his address in Glasgow. Needless to say, the seller cashed the cheque. </p> <p>\"Have we basically been robbed of \u00a3623 in broad daylight, and is there anything we can do about it?\" says Robby, who lives near Worthing in West Sussex. </p> <p>Over to eBay head of PR Victoria Sayers, who reveals that the seller's account was suspended in early July after a number of fraud complaints were filed against him. \"Other users had contacted our customer support team and let them know he had been transacting fraudulently,\" she says. </p> <p>If he hasn't done so already, Robby should report his loss to eBay and contact the police, she says. The site can work with the police to help track this person down. </p> <p>So is he going to contact the police? \"I'm definitely think ing of it,\" says Robby. \"And I was going to contact my bank to see what they say.\" </p> <p>Reading Festival promoter Mean Fiddler says that while it has a lot of sympathy for the boys' plight, \"there is a very clear message here: Don't buy tickets off eBay\". Tickets for gigs and shows that are for sale on eBay are technically invalid in most or all cases because the small print on the back usually states something to the effect that \"This ticket is not transferable or re-sellable.\" </p> <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, eBay says Robby is very much in the minority in experiencing a problem. It has 114m users worldwide and says only 0.01% of transactions end in a confirmed case of fraud. </p> <p>\"As soon as we get complaints from people [about a seller], we look into it and we will close the account rather than allow them to pose a risk to other buyers,\" says the spokeswoman. </p> <p>Every eBay member has what's called a feedback profile, including a rating number in brackets and comments from other members they have bought from and sold to. If someone has got negative feedback, \"a little alarm bell should go off\". If someone's negative feedback 'score' reaches four, their account will be suspended. </p> <p>So what payment method should you use when buying on eBay? Quite a few people do pay by cheque, despite the risks involved. One advantage of paying this way is that you can cancel a cheque - though, as happened with Robby, the seller may have cashed it before you realise anything is wrong. Among the downsides are that cheques can get lost in the post - and a dodgy seller may claim they haven't received your cheque when in fact they have. </p> <p>Meanwhile, eBay says people should be \"very wary\" of sellers who insist you pay by Western Union or another money transfer service. </p> <p>Some sellers accept credit cards directly, and eBay says most card companies \"provide 100% consumer protection against online fraud\". But make sure there is a secure way to send your card details. </p> <p>Many eBay sellers now use PayPal, eBay's electronic payment system, which offers \"buyer protection\" - a free service designed to give eBay users extra protection by covering buyers for up to \u00a3250 in the event that the item you've paid for never arrives or is \"substantially not as described\". </p> <p>If the item is not covered by that, eBay's standard purchase protection will pay out up to \u00a3120, minus a \u00a315 processing fee, though there are conditions.</p>",
  "<p>David Varney is not anybody's idea of a typical taxman, but from next week he will become the top public face of both the Inland Revenue and of the Customs people who search your car at Dover. </p> <p>The state-educated south Londoner could not be further removed from bowler-hatted cartoon character Hector the Tax Inspector, who used to exhort us to get our end of year forms in. Relaxed and chirpy, the bearded 58-year-old is willing to comment on pretty much anything - including troubled Shell, where he worked for 28 years and is still viewed by some as a potential chairman. </p> <p>Varney stepped down from just such a job at mobile phone firm mmO2 last month and formally enters the rather less glossy and fast-moving world of tax returns next Wednesday. He has not only been charged by the government to lead the tax authorities but also Customs and Excise, as executive chairman of what will be called Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. </p> <p>He has a three-year contract, and during that time has to restructure a bureaucratic giant that will have 90,000 staff and a budget of \u00a34.2bn. More than 10,000 jobs are due to go and two complex IT systems have to be merged into one. </p> <p>Fixing the Revenue sounds not just daunting but also a bit worthy to many in the City, but Varney has always been a public-spirited and inquisitive type. </p> <p>He chairs Business in the Community and has always sat on an array of bodies, including the Institute of Employment Studies and thinktank Demos. Politics has been in the background since his days as a student union president but he certainly has the ear of Labour - or at least that of the ultimate tax boss, Gordon Brown. </p> <p>The new post has come at a convenient time for him. Last year he moved from full-time to part-time, and non-executive chairmanship at mmO2, which is marketed under the O2 brand, and which he has just squeezed into profit. </p> <p>He sees some parallels between his new job and what he had to do in spinning out O2 from BT. \"I think it's important for the country that the people who are charged with raising taxes and Customs and Excise are efficient and effective. So I decided I would do this one,\" he says. </p> <p>Varney insists he has no master plan and hopes to have a better picture of what needs to be done after talking to staff. He has not spent the break between jobs entirely at his Buckingham home with his wife, a retired doctor, but has also been visiting the organisations he must weld together. It is not as daunting as all that, he insists. \"It cannot be just two bits added together with a bit of efficiency saving but one that, because of its knowledge base and interface with its clients, can actually do more. We have seen in other parts of the world - Australia and Canada - where this sort of merger has produced more joined-up government.\" </p> <p>Revenue and Customs will formally come about via an act of parliament, but some basic outlines are clear. \"There will be a single organisation. The intention is not to have a neapolitan ice-cream with Customs, then Excise with a corporate management on top of that ... At the moment the organisations don't share information in an open sense and they have not been asked to do a single interface, but what we will look at is whether we could do a one-stop shop for various clients and customer groups.\" </p> <p>So, will the series of IT schemes be scrapped in favour of a single system? \"Give us a break. I don't start until September,\" he says. But he does make clear that the appointment of a chief of information services will be one of his first jobs. </p> <p>There is no doubt the tax system needs overhauling. Varney notes that Britain shares its fiscal structure with just two other nations, Israel and Malawi. \"There is a lovely line in the Canadian annual report which is about how there is no other part in the public service that touches so many Canadians. I think the new organisation could say the same thing.\" </p> <p>Not all those dealings will be cordial, however, given that the tax authorities are engaged in a crackdown to reduce an 8% gap between what they should pull in and what they actually do. Varney believes friction with the public is not a given because the majority want to pay the tax they owe. \"Most people want to comply with what their obligations are. There may be a degree of frustration surrounding that, but there is also a small group who do not want to comply - and they need to be deterred and detected, otherwise the burden on us who do want to comply will be higher.\" </p> <p>Asked whether he is impressed by what he has seen of Revenue and Customs and Excise so far, Varney's message is diplomatic but clear: \"We have a big job to do.\" </p> <p>Part of that task will be to shed 10,500 jobs and convince those who remain their future will be brighter. Varney has a reputation for being a decent bloke, but says he is no \"poodle\" to be manipulated by the government or shy away from tough decisions. At Shell he derecognised the T&amp;G union after it refused to cooperate in a restructuring of the Shellhaven refinery in Essex. </p> <p>Are we heading for the kind of clashes seen at Royal Mail, when Allan Leighton wanted to restructure the postal system? He says he does not expect problems with the civil service unions, adding he has yet to meet their representatives but looks forward to working with them. </p> <p>Varney clearly blames union unwillingness to accept change for the closure of Shellhaven, but says they have changed since the early 1990s, when that took place. \"I think most unions now want to be part of a successful organisation and recognise painful changes sometimes have to be made. That's not to say they are patsies, but the dialogue is different now. We had our moments at British Gas [where he was chief executive], but generally we got along well. I still get Christmas cards from some union leaders, so I can't be a complete ogre.\" </p> <p>He declines to discuss regional office closures and will only talk in general terms about wider staffing issues. \"Both organisations have a proud history and powerful internal cultures, but this provides an opportunity for a new organisation of which staff can be proud and leave a heritage for a future generation. The transformation offers a chance for people to show they can thrive and prosper in a new world,\" he says. </p> <p>Has he been surprised by anything he has seen so far? \"I do not surprise easily. When I came into O2 we wrote down all the potential risks to the business. I thought that was very useful. The best way of not being surprised is spending time looking at what can go wrong.\" </p> <p>He dismisses fears about the difficulty of recruiting new and younger staff, insisting many are looking for corporate responsibility or to spend time in the public sector. Varney makes comparisons with establishing O2 as a separate entity, and is proud many staff wanted to stay but accepts some chose to leave rather than continue the \"journey\". Since he joined two years ago O2 has broken into the FTSE 100, but its future as an independent remains in doubt, given its small size in a sector of giants. </p> <p>Would he not have preferred to secure its future by tying up a proposed merger earlier this year with KPN of Holland? \"No,\" he insists. \"The whole point of being on the FTSE is to be vulnerable, to make yourself efficient and effective for all shareholders.\" </p> <p>Varney admits to being \"very concerned\" about seeing Shell immersed in a reserves scandal. He went to the oil group's recent annual meeting, in part to see how another chairman dealt with such a crisis. Did he learn anything? His reply is withering: \"There were not many lessons I wanted to take away for the O2 board.\"</p>",
  "<p>Worcestershire will be captained by a short, middle-aged man weeks away from retirement in today's C&amp;G Trophy final against Gloucestershire at Lord's but this will be of little concern to the youngsters of Bristol, up to cheer on their one-day wonders of a side. Steve Rhodes is no ordinary cricketer and he plans an appropriate finish to one of the modern game's outstanding careers. </p> <p>The eyes burn, still; the jaw sticks out, if not quite as much as that Mr Punch lookalike Alan Knott. Rhodes was the obvious choice to take charge when Ben Smith surprisingly quit the captaincy in the middle of a championship match a couple of weeks ago. </p> <p>\"Ben was not enjoying it, it's as simple as that,\" said Rhodes, who is 40 and will join the coaching staff next season. \"There was no dressing-room problem. It was his decision totally. He felt the job was affecting his form with the bat and that he was short of one-day runs.\" </p> <p>Smith's resignation has given Rhodes the chance to make a fitting farewell and also to make up for last year's one-sided final, won by Gloucestershire by seven wickets in the 21st over. </p> <p>\"We didn't really show up last time and we want to prove a point,\" he said. \"We played so badly it was a non-event. The thing I really remember is the landlord of my local village pub spending a lot of money to go down there with his wife. Letting people like that down hurt me the most and we've got to put it right. And this time we've got the one-day form behind us.\" </p> <p>His only disappointment is that his great friend and rival Jack Russell, who has retired, will not be among the opposition. \"I saw him at Cheltenham earlier this year and we said how nice it would be to play in our last final together, but it was not to be.\" </p> <p>Rhodes became Yorkshire's youngest wicketkeeper in 1981. The first-class batting that summer was led by Zaheer Abbas and Javed Miandad, and the most prominent bowlers were Richard Hadlee, Sylvester Clarke, Joel Garner and Michael Holding. </p> <p>Steve's father Billy played for Notts in the early 1960s. Rhodes was 10 when he found an old pair of his father's gloves in a cupboard and from that moment the walls of the family's paper shop were pummelled with tennis balls by the would be England stumper. </p> <p>Rhodes Jr learned his cricket in the tough Bradford League and was a star of Yorkshire's age-group sides before he first played for the county. </p> <p>He was so brilliant behind the stumps that the famously maladroit Yorkshire committee asked David Bairstow to carry on captaining but to pass the gloves to Rhodes, only to back down when Bairstow refused. Rhodes joined Worcestershire for the 1985 season. </p> <p>There he was a member of the championship winning teams of 1988 and 1989 but he was almost 30 when he won the first of his 11 Test caps in 1994. With 26 catches, two stumpings and a batting average of 55.50 in his six Tests that season he was outstanding, and the England captain Michael Atherton named him his player of the year, although he lost his form on tour in Australia the following winter. </p> <p>Like the keepers he most admires - Knott, Ian Healy and Russell - Rhodes is an all-rounder who has always recognised the importance of run-scoring. Whatever happened to the wicketkeeper-as-artist, such as Andy Brassington and Colin Metson? Even Bob Taylor would not play for England these days. </p> <p>\"Every team is trying to get that half per cent extra and a top-quality keeper who can't get runs is only playing half a game for you these days. I really like Geraint Jones.\" </p> <p>A great champion of championship cricket, he feels that the extra competition generated by two divisions has been reflected in the England side. \"But two-up two-down is definitely the way to go,\" he said. \"And we should extend the season to take some of the congestion away.\" </p> <p>But even this most professional and pragmatic of cricketers regrets the decline in social interaction with the opposition. These days there is less mixing and a little more mixing it. </p> <p>\"There is less camaraderie and polite banter with the opposition and umpires. We can't seem to distinguish between playing really tough and getting on with the opposition, which I think is important. The Australians manage it. Maybe it will come back. </p> <p>\"But it's difficult in any case now. The modern game is full of warm-downs, stretches and ice baths at the end of the day, with everyone monitoring what you're drinking and eating. It's become very professional and this is definitely the way to go forward. But, when you don't have time to talk to your mate on the other side, you miss out on a lot. And I don't mean just socially. </p> <p>\"You miss out on the little things I had as a youngster, such as pinning my ears back and listening to Richard Hadlee when he talked cricket. You learned a lot and I'm sure today's young players could learn as much from Glenn McGrath if he decided to talk about bowling.\" </p> <p>Rhodes - \"Bumpy\" to everyone in cricket - will not mind buying a drink or two tonight if he leads his side to victory in the domestic game's premier one-day competition.</p>"
