  "<p>There are few photographers whose style is instantly recognisable, like that of a great painter or film director; even fewer whose photographs have also been printed in popular magazines and newspapers throughout the world, in many cases over and over again; and only one whose life has, in addition, become legendary - Henri Cartier-Bresson, who has died aged 95.</p> <p>One of my cherished possessions is his book <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/FramerT_MAG.aspx?V=CDocT&amp;E=2S5RYDI0CKPH&amp;DT=DOC\">Henri Cartier-Bresson In India</a> (1985), handsomely signed for me by its author. The preface by the film director Satyajit Ray distils Cartier-Bresson's uniqueness as a photographer better than any other writing. His work, said Ray, was \"unique in its fusion of head and heart, in its wit and its poetry ... The deep regard for people that is revealed in these Indian photographs, as well as in his photographs of any people anywhere in the world, invests them with a palpable humanism. Add to this the unique skill and vision that raise the ordinary and the ephemeral to a monumental level and you have the hallmark of the greatest photographer of our time.\" One is tempted to add: perhaps of all time. </p> <p>The celebrated series of photographs of Gandhi, his assassination and funeral in 1948, first published in Life, show how right Ray was. There is <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=DOC&amp;E=2S5RYDI0CKPH&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=127&amp;Pic=63&amp;SubE=2S5RYDO4K7DU\">the Mahatma in conversation seen from the back</a>, half in shadow, with his left arm lifted in bright sunlight, palm outstretched, as if to say \"What can I do?\"; there is <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=ALB&amp;E=29YL53KGUTK&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=352&amp;Pic=105&amp;SubE=2S5RYDTWO3J\">a sombre Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, at night, announcing the death to the waiting crowd</a>; and there is <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=DOC&amp;E=2S5RYDI0CKPH&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=127&amp;Pic=77&amp;SubE=2S5RYD1Q88PP\">the flower-covered body</a> in the morning surrounded by veiled devotees, <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=DOC&amp;E=2S5RYDI0CKPH&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=127&amp;Pic=84&amp;SubE=2S5RYDILS60A\">the funeral procession</a> - a veritable ocean of eager Indians - with a ragged tree poking up precariously bent under its load of spectators, and <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=DOC&amp;E=2S5RYDI0CKPH&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=127&amp;Pic=101&amp;SubE=2S5RYDY2BDXQ\">Gandhi's secretary watching the first flames of the funeral pyre</a>, his face in a private anguish. </p> <p>Cartier-Bresson had been fortunate in his timing. He was introduced to Gandhi on the afternoon of January 30 1948 and showed him the small catalogue of his one-man exhibition the previous year at New York's Museum of Modern Art. Gandhi looked through it slowly, page by page, saying nothing until he came to the photo of <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CSearchZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=SearchThumb_SearchZoom&amp;o=&amp;Total=7&amp;FP=666080&amp;E=2V6DH6W5LS5X&amp;SID=JMGEJN9MUBHZ&amp;Pic=4&amp;SubE=2S5RYDWZXG1S\">a man gazing at an elaborate hearse</a>. He asked: \"What is the meaning of this picture?\" Cartier-Bresson told him, \"That's Paul Claudel, a Catholic poet very much concerned with the spiritual issues of life and death.\" Gandhi thought for a moment, and then said, very distinctly: \"Death - death - death.\" Cartier-Bresson left at 4.45pm. Fifteen minutes later, the Mahatma was dead. </p> <p>Stories like this, combined with the catchphrase title of the English translation of Cartier-Bresson's first book, The Decisive Moment (1952), have tended to give the impression that Cartier-Bresson believed that story-telling, the catching on film of the historic moment, was the essence of good photography. In fact, he meant something very different; and his best work was remarkable for the way it ignored - as opposed to focused on - the usual dramatic props of the photojournalist. When he covered <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=ALB&amp;E=29YL53KGUTK&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=352&amp;Pic=63&amp;SubE=2S5RYDZL4L4L\">the 1937 coronation of George VI in London</a>, for instance, Cartier-Bresson photographed <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=ALB&amp;E=29YL53KGUTK&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=352&amp;Pic=66&amp;SubE=2S5RYDISUQVY\">the crowd</a>, not the procession. And one of his well known photographs of the communist takeover of China in 1948-49 shows <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=ALB&amp;E=29YL53KGUTK&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=352&amp;Pic=118&amp;SubE=2S5RYDIZRJO6\">an agitated queue of ordinary Shanghai Chinese</a> \"like a human accordion, squeezed in and out by invisible hands,\" in his own words. It is, in fact, a gold rush - a run on a Shanghai bank - but we see no bank, no bars of gold, and no mounted police in the photograph. Instead, we concentrate on the faces of the people and the form of the crowd and are offered \"the perfect visual metaphor for civil strife\" (Dan Hofstadter). </p> <p>Photography, wrote Cartier-Bresson, \"is at one and the same time the recognition of a fact in a fraction of a second and the rigorous arrangement of the forms visually perceived which give the fact impression and significance\". An obsession with form in Cartier-Bresson was profoundly linked to his first love - drawing and painting - to which he would return in later life when he abandoned photojournalism. It also ran in his family. His great-grandfather was an artist, and an uncle was a talented and prize-winning painter; and the family business was in textiles. The Cartier-Bresson logo used to be found in every French sewing basket. </p> <p>Born six years before the outbreak of the first world war, Cartier-Bresson was brought up as a member of the haute bourgeoisie of Paris, surrounded by considerable wealth and with rather formal parental relations. Though his childhood was happy enough, his school career was undistinguished, and he soon rebelled against the values of his family. Throughout his life he remained a deeply contradictory mixture of thoroughbred gentleman and quick-tempered libertarian. In his early adulthood, he was drawn to communism and surrealism - without joining either movement - and in 1927-28 studied art with the painter and critic Andr\u00e9 Lhote in Paris, and, in 1929, painting and literature in Cambridge. He became passionately absorbed in Parisian avant-garde culture, most of his friends being writers or painters, rather than photographers. </p> <p>It was therefore natural that Cartier-Bresson should spend a period in Africa, following the lead of writers like Andr\u00e9 Gide and Louis Ferdinant Celine. In 1931, he travelled in west Africa, where he took up hunting in earnest and became a very good shot. Charles de Gaulle later told him that a photographer resembled a hunter - he had to aim well, fire fast, and cut out. Cartier-Bresson agreed, and was always known for the quickness of his photography (he loved the word snap); but after returning from Africa he lost his taste for hunting animals. \"What I like,\" he once said, \"is the stalking; I have no use for the meat.\" He tended to treat the printing and publication of his photographs in the same way, to the exasperation of magazine editors: it was three years before he got around to seeing prints of many of the photos he took while wandering Asia from 1947 to 1950. He made it a rule never to entangle himself in the technology of printing his own photographs. </p> <p>He had used a camera in Africa, but it was not until 1932 that he acquired the light 35mm Leica that would become his inseparable companion. He used a 50mm lens, occasionally a 90mm one, that was all: no tripod, flash, reflectors or other aids. And no cropping of the image: this was one of the goals of the famous photo agency, Magnum, founded in 1947 by war photographer Robert Capa, Cartier-Bresson, David Seymour and George Rodger - to assert the right of the photographer to the integrity of his image. This insistence by Cartier-Bresson on using only available light, and on editing \"in the camera\" (rather than in the darkroom), influenced the then fledgling director Satyajit Ray in the making of his Apu Trilogy. (Moreover, Cartier-Bresson never took to colour film, after a few brave attempts.) </p> <p>From the beginning, he made the Leica as inconspicuous as possible. The shiny parts he covered in black tape; sometimes he hid the whole camera under a handkerchief. He also tried to make the photographer as invisible as could be. Photographs of Cartier-Bresson do exist, but they are few in number: when he accepted an honorary doctorate from Oxford University in 1975, he held a paper in front of his face to avoid being snapped. Furthermore, he was always reticent about his methods and gave few interviews. Partly this was for professional reasons, but more importantly it was a true reflection of his modesty and reserve, combined with his own inability to explain how he took his classic images. </p> <p>The first of these were of <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CDocZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=DocThumb_DocZoom&amp;o=&amp;DT=ALB&amp;E=29YL53KGUTK&amp;Pass=&amp;Total=352&amp;Pic=48&amp;SubE=2S5RYD1305UC\">Mexico</a>, where he was invited to join a surveying expedition as photographer. When the expedition collapsed, a penniless Cartier-Bresson began selling snapshots to local newspapers. By the end of 1934, his photographs had been exhibited in Mexico City, Madrid and New York city. During the 1930s they also appeared in Verve, the influential Paris-based magazine published by the Greek-born Efstratios T\u00e9riade, who became Cartier-Bresson's lifelong aficionado. </p> <p>But now the photographer abandoned still photography for filmmaking. From 1936 to 1939 he worked as an assistant to Jean Renoir in the production of Une Partie De Campagne (1936) and Renoir's greatest film, La R\u00e8gle Du Jeu (1939). The latter was, said Cartier-Bresson half a century later, \"a premonition of everything that was to happen in the world\". In the first film, he played a small role as a young Catholic seminarist distracted by the sight of a charming girl's petticoats, and in the second he selected the chateau at the centre of the film, worked on the scripts and dialogue - which had a wit and \u00e9lan like Cartier-Bresson's conversation - and organised the famous hunting scene; he shot the rabbits while the actors pretended to do so. Renoir himself \"was like a great river of warmth and simplicity\" - qualities wonderfully captured in Cartier-Bresson's photoportraits of Renoir - \"but Jean knew very well that I would never make a feature film. He saw that I had no imagination.\" Instead, Cartier-Bresson took up documentary filmmaking, and in 1943, after escaping from a German prisoner-of-war camp, he set up a film unit for the Resistance. </p> <p>He often reiterated this judgment on himself: no imagination. It seems surprising, given the extraordinary empathy evident in his photographs, particularly his distinguished, finally enigmatic portraits of both the known and the unknown. But its essential truth is clear from his drawing and painting, to which he seriously applied himself from the age of 60 (he stopped taking photos for Magnum in 1966). His subjects as an artist were always representational and drawn from life, chiefly French life - buildings, landscapes, animal skeletons in a museum, portraits of friends and models (clothed and nude, unlike most of his photographs) - they were never taken from his own imagination and fantasy, which as an artist he appears to have distrusted. Deeply aware of the traditions of painting - more so than perhaps any other leading photographer - Cartier-Bresson struggled to draw and paint, as he had never struggled to take photographs. The results were generally competent and occasionally inspired, such as certain portraits, including those of his second wife, Martine Franck (his first marriage to Ratna Mohini, a Javanese dancer, ended in divorce); they also showed a sensuous feeling for colour, absent of course from his photographs. But their main interest must derive from their being the work of a great photographer. </p> <p>Cartier-Bresson felt, more keenly than most, the tension between the active life, such as the photographer's, and the meditative life, such as that of the painter. He constantly spoke of his attraction to Buddhism, which in his view taught that \"life changes every minute, the world is born and dies every minute.\" But the discrepancy between himself and the Buddha belied his claims. According to his amused wife, he belonged to the sect of the Agitated Buddhists. And an old friend once told him: \"But think about the statues of Buddha, Henri. Their eyes are almost always closed, while yours are almost always open.\" </p> <p>We must be eternally grateful for what those penetrating blue eyes chose to record over more than half a century. Whatever else he was, Cartier-Bresson was in love with life. His photographs are mysteriously alive, balletic, and his finest portraits have the complex presence of C\u00e9zanne or Rembrandt. Among the most delightful is one showing <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CSearchZ_MAG.aspx?Stat=SearchThumb_SearchZoom&amp;o=&amp;Total=65&amp;FP=667629&amp;E=2V6DH6W5L04W&amp;SID=JMGEJN9MNBDZ&amp;Pic=63&amp;SubE=2S5RYDYHG1WY\">the broad back of the aged Henri Matisse sitting in his studio at Vence (near Nice) painting a portrait of a beautiful woman with a voluptuous bosom</a>. Cartier-Bresson deeply admired the sensuous forms of Matisse (who designed the glorious jacket of The Decisive Moment), and he felt bothered by Matisse's description of his radiant stained glass at the Dominican chapel in Vence as the culmination of his life's work. \"Monsieur Matisse,\" he finally ventured, \"you have never shown any serious interest in religion, and you are all the time painting these odalisques, these beautiful girls. Why didn't you decorate, instead of this Christian church, a Temple of Voluptuous Delight? Wouldn't that have suited your temperament better?\" </p> <p>Matisse listened carefully, his face grew very serious, and then he said to Cartier-Bresson, \"You are right, of course. But the only institution that would ever commission a Temple of Voluptuous Delight is the French Republic, and no French government has ever made me the offer.\" </p> <p>In 2003, the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, showcasing his and other photographers' work, opened in Paris. He is survived by his wife Martine, herself a well known photographer, and their daughter M\u00e9lanie. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Henri Cartier-Bresson, photographer, born August 22 1908; died August 3 2004</p>",
  "<p>What price fresh air? The poet Alfred Lord Tennyson loved the Isle of Wight's sea breeze enough to declare it to be worth 6p a pint - a fair sum in Victorian times. </p> <p>Anyone looking to escape urban life might find it similarly precious today. With Brighton always busy and Kent's quiet seaside resorts turning into \"London-on-sea\", the Isle of Wight offers a real feeling of escape by the south coast. A half-hour ferry crossing gets you pretty harbour towns, clean beaches, rolling fields and, most noticeably that fresh, clean, invigorating air. </p> <p>It may not be that glamorous and lively, but it's not just buckets and spades and coloured-sand cliffs either. Many smaller towns and seaside resorts on the island retain a faded Victorian feel - beach boxes and stately homes are remnants of 19th century visitors who flocked to the health resorts bearing the royal approval of Victoria and Albert. But the Isle of Wight offers plenty of opportunities for more modern activities. The annual music festival draws thousands of music-lovers to the island: this summer being no exception when 35,000 gathered to hear David Bowie, The Who and the Stereophonics perform. If you don't make it for the music however, there is always yachting, paragliding, kitesurfing, wind surfing and powerboat racing. </p> <p>The more sedate activities in which I took part, walking and cycling, made it a great weekend away: a stress-free and refreshing time where the exercise involved could be used as an excuse to enjoy a hearty lunch and a pint in some of the island's cosy pubs. </p> <p>The Isle of Wight has over 200 miles of bridle ways, cycle ways and byways to ride on. Broken down, this equates to 12 circular routes that cover nearly the whole of the island. You can cover most parts of them on the 62-mile \"round the island route\" that can (allegedly) be completed within eight hours. There are a few off-road tracks for the more adventurous, but many are built along old railway tracks or follow quiet country lanes. All the routes are excellently signposted and you get a real feeling for the countryside by bike. </p> <p>One ride on the south side of the island from Chale to Brighstone took us along country lanes almost hidden between lush hedgerows full of flowers, butterflies and birds, to open fields with stunning views down to the sea beyond. More reward for exercise was enjoyed en route by stopping at a farm for a glass of cold milk and some home-made ice cream. Tiny villages along this 12-mile round trip were like something out of a Beatrix Potter book - a duck pond with reeds and a half-sunken boat, thatched-roof cottages and noisy barnyard animals.</p> <p>Because the island is only 23 miles across and 13 miles in length, most of it is accessible by bike or on foot. One way to do it would be to ride round the island in stages, stopping overnight at a B&amp;B - by staying in one place only there is a limit to how many cycling routes you can reach. There is just one train link on the island, and the buses are not cheap, with a one-way trip a few miles down the road costing over \u00a34. </p> <p>It was thanks to one of these buses, though, that we discovered the other great delight of the Isle of Wight - walking. Getting off at the wrong stop actually turned into a beautiful walk following the edges of towering chalk cliffs, through the town of Freshwater, up onto the Downs and all the way out to the Needles - an outcrop of limestone rocks at the end of the peninsula which jut out of the sea like submerged teeth. </p> <p>Tennyson, who once lived in Freshwater, loved to walk these Downs, so much so that when he died the town erected a memorial and named the walking trail after him. The towering Celtic-engraved cross stands at the highest point of the walk across the Downs, which is also named after him. The views from here are magnificent, back along the cliffs, and also to the north, where you can see more of the island and the south coast of England. </p> <p>From the monument, it's an easier walk to the end of the cliffs through stunted gorse bushes, and roaming sheep and cows. After walking such a long way with the end goal of the Needles in sight, to actually reach them for a photo opportunity was slightly disappointing. Perhaps this wasn't helped by the howling winds and lack of guard railings between you and a 100ft drop. </p> <p>At the end of the cliffs lies a rocket-launching site, a remnant of the test site for the British Ballistic Missile and space programme which ran between 1955-71. You can still see the chambers and network of tunnels from where they were launched, making the platform halfway up the cliff face feel like a very strange place.</p> <p>From there the coast extends around to the multi-coloured sandstone cliffs of Alum Bay, featured on seemingly all postcards from the Isle of Wight. As over half of the island is designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty, there are many more places to walk and cycle that are worth exploring. </p> <p>One is Parkhurst Forest, the only site in the UK other than Scotland with a red squirrel population. Known in medieval times as the King's forest, Parkhurst is one of the oldest recorded forests in the country, mentioned in the Domesday Book and in later centuries providing timber for England's warships. Despite numerous hides, viewing platforms and wooden red squirrel totem poles, on this particular day none decided to come out for a picture. The three-mile tramp through the drizzling rain with backpacks was not quite in vain, with some spectacular sections of ancient oak, beech and pine trees and another rewarding pub lunch at the other end. </p> <p>It's quiet, yes. Clubbing and shopping are definitely off the agenda and the usual things we have become accustomed to living in a big city - shops open round the clock, cash machines and a variety of restaurants - are few and far between on the southern side of the island. But for me, that only added to the appeal.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>A four-night stay at Chale Bay Farm on a B&amp;B basis, including two days' cycle hire and car ferry crossings from Southampton to Cowes, costs from \u00a3168 per person (based on two sharing) with <a href=\" http://www.redfunnelholidays.co.uk\">Red Funnel Holidays</a>, 0870 444 8890</p>",
  "In his Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World, the Pope has taken on feminism, which most people outside universities thought dead and buried years ago. The attack, written by 77-year-old Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, to which his Frailness merely gave the nod, need not cause too much shock and horror. Anything denounced from the papal throne is instantly catapulted into the awareness of the poor in the Catholic third world, whose view of the Roman hierarchy is already profoundly disenchanted. Family planning workers in the vast slums of Catholic Latin America will tell you that whenever the Pope is known to have been inveighing against contraception, and the cry is taken up by every local pulpit, people flock to the clinics, avid for pills and IUDs. His Holiness's grief and wrath is far more effective in persuading the indigent faithful that contraception actually works than anything the family planners might say. Now that his nibs has turned his attention to feminism, oppressed women may very well begin to suspect that there must be something in it after all. <p>Bavarian Ratzinger, described by some as the Panzerkardinal, was once an academic theologian, with lamentable tendencies towards essentialism. What he says could not bind the faithful unless his Holiness agreed to ventriloquise ex cathedra, and definitely to lay down a doctrine of faith or morals. This Pope has never made an ex cathedra pronouncement and now for sure never will. Ratzinger is free, and has been free for years, to air his convictions as and when he pleases, generating sententious humbug as specious as anything spun by secular authorities. On the global scandal of sexual abuse of children by the Catholic clergy and the condonation of such abuse by the higher clergy, the Pontiff and his enforcer have remained shtoom for years, while believers left in droves and bishoprics took bankruptcy rather than pay damages. When it comes to excoriating feminism, tight-lipped Ratzinger, head of the Vatican Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, once known as the Inquisition, allows himself to babble like an advertising copywriter. The church, run by celibates and pseudo-celibates in their own interest, is declared to be \"expert in humanity\", a claim that those of us who endured Catholic schools from the ages of four to 17 would find ludicrous. </p> <p>The Ratzinger-Wojtyla axis is worried about \"certain currents of thought which are often at variance with the authentic advancement of women\" that have arisen in \"recent years\". The \"expert in humanity\" has invoked this notion before, in 1988, with the apostolic letter Mulieris dignitatem; the main points were reiterated in the Pope's Letter to Women, issued on the occasion of the Beijing Conference of 1995. The purpose of these 10-year utterances is not to reveal new thinking on the part of the Vatican, but to rephrase the old thinking so that it appears to be a hip response to new pressures. As far as the Church is concerned, there has been no change; for women, though not for men, \"to serve is to reign\". What is new is that the papal thinktank has deliberately taken on feminism, probably because it considers that feminism is now a straw man, a sort of Iraq, enfeebled and incapable of retaliation, to be devastated with impunity. The effects on the church itself could prove disastrous. Parish priests are rapidly losing their hold over the common people, who are better educated and more sceptical than they were when Wojtyla and Ratzinger were boys. The worshippers to be found in parish churches are mostly female and mostly elderly. Women of reproductive age, aware that in practising contraception they are considered to be living in sin and unfit to receive the blessed sacrament, are staying away from mass. Their children will stay away, too. </p> <p>According to the papal thinktank, the false prophets of feminism have had a tendency \"to emphasise strongly conditions of subordination in order to give rise to antagonism\". The subordination, it would appear, is real, but feminists who refer to it will be accused of having no higher aim than to \"give rise to antagonism\". Such contempt for the motives of others explains how Wojtyla supported Solidarity, the Polish workers' movement, when he was archbishop of Krakow, but as Pope refused to support the worker priests led by Archbishop Helder Camara, the only articulate people fighting the cause of the dispossessed peasants in Brazil, the largest Catholic nation on earth. The priests were already vulnerable to the Brazilian authorities because of their involvement in organising mass protests. Wojtyla's intervention reassured the posseiros and their allies that the church's resources would no longer be used in the struggle against them. </p> <p>The long-term result has been a waning of faith even among the suggestible poor in Brazil, who were drawn off into evangelical sects. Now only 13% of Brazilians ever go to mass. Brazil, which was 99% Catholic 50 years ago, is still three-quarters Catholic, but its Catholicism is now less than lukewarm. The phenomenon is repeated all over Latin America; the people still call themselves Catholic but their participation in the life of the church is notional rather than actual. Globally, Catholics use as much contraception, have as many abortions, and divorce as often as non-Catholics; the difference is that they must accept that they have sinned, and endure guilt and punishment, hence the ban on condom use for Catholics, even if they have full-blown Aids. </p> <p>Wojtyla's refusal to support liberationists in Brazil was in no way motivated by reluctance to involve the church in politics. Neither Wojtyla nor Ratzinger would hesitate to intervene in any political situation that threatened religious orthodoxy. In June this year, Ratzinger issued \"Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion. General Principles\", arguing that support for abortion rights and euthanasia would render a Catholic unworthy of receiving the sacrament. The purpose of this paper, which was originally written in English, was to pressure American bishops into refusing to allow John Kerry to receive communion, thus effectively excommunicating him, and frightening Catholics away from voting for him. Kerry's persecution is the more remarkable because nothing of the kind had ever been attempted in Italy, where a succession of Catholic politicians have made no secret of their liberal principles. The attempted interference in US politics is likely to prove another own goal, as non-Catholics are reassured about Catholic Kerry's liberal credentials. To their credit, the American bishops resisted the call to direct action, taking refuge in a verbal fudge that Ratzinger had not had the foresight to pre-empt. </p> <p>Those people who see in the encyclical a rapprochement between feminism and the papacy have got to be more concerned for their faith than for their sanity. Although Catholics will argue passionately that no human being should be brought into existence for the benefit of another, and Ratzinger, the hammer of heresy, would lead them in their rejection of human cloning, they are happy to accept the biblical account that says that Eve was cloned from Adam's rib because it was not good for him to be alone. Though Ratzinger believes that man and woman are made in God's image (which would seem to mean that God is hermaphroditic rather than sexless), he is a confirmed heterosexualist. For him there can be no blurring of the essential contrast, man = hammer, woman = anvil. Woman can only exist within a male context, carrying out male-defined functions, for which she should be praised and rewarded. </p> <p>Catholic feminists who snatch at the straw of the Pope's statement that housework should be paid for should remember that Wojtyla cannot imagine a world in which housework is done by anyone but women. His Holiness's lavatory is cleaned by nuns. </p> <p><b>Catholic women respond ... </b></p> <p><b>Frances Kissling, president of US-based Catholics for a Free Choice</b> </p> <p>It's funny that some women have to find some good in this document when it's not there. Maybe it speaks to the Vatican view that women are basically nicer. The points that have been welcomed are not new. Moreover, the reason put forward for wanting women in the workplace is that they have some kind of 'feminine' civilising influence. This seems to me offensive, to men and to women. And where are the men in this document? Apart from Adam, they don't get a mention. What about men's values? The Vatican has this notion of the hedonistic northern woman and the pure southern woman, who doesn't want freedom or equality - but women in Latin America and Africa want just as much in terms of rights and freedoms, if not more. </p> <p><b>Esther Chavez, women's rights activist, Mexico</b> </p> <p>This letter presents women as people with limited consciousness, who do not know the difference between right and wrong, and it ignores those who are abused and have no access to justice. What about those women whose fathers or husbands take away their pay packet? It's a big disappointment. </p> <p><b>Dr Mary Condren, lecturer in gender and women's studies, Trinity College, Dublin</b> </p> <p>Presented by a first-year undergraduate, this essay would barely merit a pass. So why bother to respond? The continued assault on lesbian and homosexual relationships fuels homophobia. Faulty logic, backed by the veto power of the Vatican and aligned with rightwing fundamentalisms will, at forthcoming UN meetings, have serious consequences for non-western women struggling for self-determination. If Jesus were here today he would be crying out, \"Not in my name.\" </p> <p><b>Alessandra Mussolini, rightwing MEP, Italy</b> </p> <p>The Pope says women are important - but we should stay at home and be important there. He is telling women to stop fighting when there's more fighting to do. But this isn't a fight against men; it's a fight for our rights. Why can't women say mass, I wonder? What I'd like to see is the Pope with a beautiful female cardinal at his side. </p> <p><b>Maria Jose Rosado Nunes, lecturer at the Catholic University of Sao Paulo, Brazil</b> </p> <p>These men have no right to speak for us. The document equates women with maternity, and gives them no intrinsic value: they are for others, for men, for their children, for the church. </p> <p><b>Matilda Musumba, anthropologist and NGO worker, Nairobi, Kenya</b> </p> <p>This speaks to my mother's and grandmother's generations.

  "<p><strong>Not that I want to be the kind of woman who spends her time cleaning behind the fridge, but I do at least like to be sure that the inside smells hygienic. Any tips?</strong> </p> <p>Buy a tub of bicarbonate of soda. Make a little of it into a weak solution to wipe down the shelves and surfaces, and keep a bowl of the dry stuff inside the fridge to absorb any strong odours. For a more pleasant smell, leave a little ground coffee in an open packet on the shelf. And you can relax about cleaning behind the fridge - it only needs doing every six months. Pull it out from the wall, dust the wiggly pipes at the back, vacuum any debris you have revealed, wipe down streaks and spills on the sides of the fridge with a solution of washing-up liquid - and relax with a smug smile. </p> <p><strong>You say the fridge needs to be kept at or below 5C. So how can I be sure mine is?</strong> </p> <p>Strictly speaking, it should be between 0C and 5C (32F and 41F), and the only way to check that your fridge is keeping your food cool enough for safety is to put a fridge thermometer on the middle shelf. The one that did best in recent Good Housekeeping Institute tests is the Ultimo fridge-freezer thermometer, \u00a34.55 (stockists 015394 88100; <a href=\"http://www.lakelandlimited.co.uk\">www.lakelandlimited.co.uk</a>). It's easy to use, with a clear dial with accurate readings in celsius and fahrenheit. </p> <p><strong>I'm thinking of replacing my under-counter fridge and freezer with a combined fridge-freezer. What can you recommend?</strong> </p> <p>Among the fridges in this test that had them, the iceboxes are mostly designed for little more than a tub of ice cream and a packet of frozen peas. In the Good Housekeeping Institute's most recent tests on fridge-freezers (July 2003), top marks went to the fridge-on-top Hotpoint FFA60S, \u00a3329.90-\u00a3360, 80/100 (standard width and depth, 1,611mm high) and the American-style side-by-side Whirlpool conquest S20B RSS31, \u00a31,377-\u00a31,999.95, 78/100, 1,750mm high x 902mm wide. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Next month's product test, to be published on September 2, will be on microwave ovens.

  "<p>Sir Clive Booth, chairman of the new Big Lottery Fund (BLF) that is responsible for handing out half of all \"good causes\" money raised by the national lottery, believes his fund will be at least as open to charities and community groups as were its predecessor bodies.</p> <p>The BLF has been formed from the administrative merger of the Community Fund, which gives out funds to charities and community groups, and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF). Funds from the NOF have been tied to the three government priorities of health, education and the environment, as well as very specific schemes also laid down by ministers.</p> <p>Sir Clive welcomed today's announcement by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, that the fund will be free to determine its own grants programmes. The removal of the periodically-dipping hand of government is \"almost too good to be true\", he says.</p> <p>Sir Clive added: \"I'm really trying to get away from the notion that all we are is the Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) bolted together.\"</p> <p>But he recognised that voluntary organisations, many of which have had funding from the Community Fund's open grants programme, have been concerned that the new regime may not be as open.</p> <p>\"You tell me the kind of project you think won't be covered by the new structure,\" he challenged. \"We want to be as open and flexible as we can.\"</p> <p>\"Voluntary organisations will be wary that because we're taking a slightly more strategic approach, this is going to cause some voluntary bodies to lose out. I'm saying tell me who they are and we'll consider it.\"</p> <p>Sir Clive and his team at the BLF have devised a funding strand dubbed the \"deli\" - from its official description, \"demand-led, lightly prescribed funding\". It will allow grant applications that are not tied to specific programmes under a rolling application process.</p> <p>This will account for a proportion - yet to be determined - of the \u00a31.2bn funds to be given out under the government's three \"themes\": community learning and creating opportunity; promoting community safety and cohesion; and promoting wellbeing. A similar system will apply to the expanded Awards for All programme.</p> <p>The rest of the funding under the three themes will be channelled through five or six programmes, including, Sir Clive said, the cherished international programme and research.</p> <p>The BLF will set outcomes against which applications will be judged - and some solicited - in a time-limited application process. This will allow the BLF to think strategically about where it is putting its money and cut down the bureaucracy that a purely open-to-all-comers approach could generate.</p> <p>He added: \"One of the important messages for the voluntary and community sector coming out of this announcement is we are pledging that at least 60% of the total finds will go to the voluntary sector.\"</p> <p>Sir Clive backed Tessa Jowell's enthusiasm for a greater public say in how lottery funds are spent. One avenue could be a public vote on where the big transformational grants go, although he added that it was too early to say if this was definitely going to happen.</p> <p>He also pointed to the piloting of pre-paid postcards on which lottery players can indicate preferences for lottery funding and citizens' juries.</p> <p>But he was adamant that the fund would not be pushed into excluding causes that might not be popular with all sections of the public - or with the rightwing press (a reference to a critical report by the Daily Mail on a community fund grant made to an anti-deportation group working with asylum seekers).</p> <p>\"For me, public participation is not about having a referendum ... it's about drilling down into the different views people have. The public is very diverse and I think will want different things. It would be unacceptable to spend all the money on one category.\"</p> <p>The BLF would not be \"risk averse\" in its grantmaking, he promised. \"We'll be risk aware, but I also hope we'll be courageous and not succumb to unreasonable pressure from people who have a particular point of view.</p> <p>\"As long as we do it with our eyes open, we can live with that and we'll defend our actions as and when. It's impossible to be innovative if you are cautious and conservative.\"</p> <p>Sir Clive, a former senior civil servant, worked on pioneering polytechnics in the 1960s and then went on to run one (Oxford). He is getting into his latest job with relish. \"This is the one that more than any of the others gives me a buzz,\" he says of his move to the Big Lottery Fund. \"And now my wife calls me Mr Big.\"</p> <p>If next April, when the new funding streams begin and the voluntary sector feels the BLF lives up to Sir Clive's promises, the nickname could catch on.</p>",
  "<p>Labour's electorally critical record on crime came under attack today as the Conservatives claimed many police authorities would face budget shortfalls next year, when the next general election is likely to be held.</p> <p>Despite the government's commitment to putting an extra 20,000 community support officers on the street and the announcement in last month's spending review of an extra \u00a32.2bn for policing, at least six forces face multimillion-pound deficits, according to research the Tories have carried out.</p> <p>David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said the alleged shortfall would led to a reduction of officers on the street and more crime across the country.</p> <p>He told the BBC: \"We were beginning to get feedback from police authorities saying that they were not going to have enough money next year - Suffolk \u00a36m short, Norfolk \u00a37.8m, Kent \u00a319m. </p> <p>\"So we looked around the country and we found a large number of police authorities saying they were going to face difficulties next year. </p> <p>\"This is completely at odds with what the government is saying and actually will lead to fewer policemen on the beat and therefore a bigger risk of crime for the country. </p> <p>\"These were numbers given to us by the police authorities, not our exaggeration. We have just taken the numbers we have been given and are reflecting what we have been told about the effects on their attempts to maintain the police service.\" </p> <p>The survey found the Metropolitan police expecting to have to save \u00a360m in order to balance its budget and Kent police facing a \u00a319m deficit, which could lead to cuts.</p> <p>Devon and Cornwall said it might need to save about \u00a35m next year, while Cambridgeshire blamed financial problems on one-off operations such as the Soham murder case and the policing of animal rights extremist activity against Huntingdon Life Sciences.</p> <p>However, an element of pre-negotiation jostling from the police authorities cannot be discounted. Their settlement for next year will be made known in November by David Blunkett.</p> <p>The Association of Police Authorities (APA) said the figures from the Conservative survey \"sound like they are too pessimistic\" but warned that there would be \"a major funding gap\" that could lead to cuts. </p> <p>Jim Wilson, a member of the APA's funding group and chairman of Norfolk Police Authority, said: \"There is a lot of concern about police funding for the next financial year. </p> <p>\"Although we will not see government allocations until November, the Home Office has indicated it will not increase funding in real terms. </p> <p>\"We anticipate a 3% increase in government funding, but the average police authority needs a 5.5% budget increase just to maintain the current level of services. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will not tolerate high increases in precepts on council tax payers.\" </p> <p>He said a 3% rise in precepts and 3% from the Home Office would leave police authorities with a shortfall of around \u00a3350m nationally. </p> <p>\"There is going to be a major funding gap and there are consequences that flow from that,\" he said. \"It points to a situation where police authorities will have to look at cuts.\" </p> <p>With staff costs accounting for 83% of police authorities' budgets, they could find themselves forced to cut back on civilian backroom workers. Police officers could then be moved off the beat to cover for them, Mr Wilson said. </p> <p>\"Eventually cuts will be felt in terms of police visibility and in the reassurance given by frontline policing. That would fly totally in the face of what the home secretary wants to see.\" </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, later responded, challenging the Tories to account for their planned \u00a31.6bn cut to the Home Office budget. </p> <p>He said: \"The Conservatives must say where the axe will fall. How many police officers, community support officers and CCTV schemes will they cut? One thing is clear: with the Tories, more cuts means more crime.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said: \"The Tories have no properly costed solutions to local government funding problems. They cannot even fund their wild claims to increase police numbers by 40,000 without putting asylum seekers on a fictional desert island.\" </p> <p>The survey found: <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The Greater Manchester force is looking for more money from the government in its next budget and is \"particularly concerned\" over the high number of officers who were recruited 30 years ago and are now at the point of retirement. There is also a potential problem with the funding of pensions <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Kent is looking at a deficit of \u00a319m, which may lead to cuts <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Thames Valley is expecting a \"tight\" budget settlement and could be in deficit if it does not make savings <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Gloucestershire is expecting its settlement to be quite low<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Devon and Cornwall expects its budget to be tight. It may have to save around \u00a35m next year <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Cambridgeshire has problems caused by the costs of one-off operations, including the Soham murders case and the policing of animal rights extremist activity against Huntingdon Life Sciences<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Surrey gets the lowest settlement of any police authority as crime levels are low. However, it has the same administrative and staffing costs as any other authority, compounded by the high cost of housing in the south-east <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Derbyshire expects a shortfall <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The Metropolitan police expects to have to save \u00a360m to balance its budget <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Warwickshire is still working on potential figures but is looking for internal efficiency savings <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Durham, Merseyside, Hampshire and North Yorkshire do not have any specific problems <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The Conservatives quoted a report last month by the BBC's Look East programme that claimed Suffolk was facing a \u00a36m deficit <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Northamptonshire faces a shortfall of \u00a31.7m, and Norfolk is trying to head off a \u00a37.8m deficit, the survey quoted the BBC as saying</p>",
  "He obviously has - or had - a truly stupendous voice, matched for magnificence perhaps only by the size of his stomach. But, according to a book to be published this autumn, Luciano Pavarotti is also childish, obsessive, over-demanding, lecherous and very, very rude. <p>The operatic tenor whose CD became the first classical album to reach No 1 in the UK pop charts and the man most responsible for the fact that every football fan can hum a Puccini aria is, says his former agent and publicity manager Herbert Breslin, a monster. </p> <p>Breslin, who represented Pavarotti for more than 30 years before the pair's acrimonious public break-up in 2002, describes his book, written with the New York Times music critic Anne Midgette, as \"the story of a very beautiful, simple, lovely guy who turned into a very determined, aggressive and somewhat unhappy superstar\". </p> <p>The King and I: The Uncensored Tale of Luciano Pavarotti's Rise to Fame by His Manager, Friend and Sometime Adversary, will be published in October by Doubleday in America and Mainstream in the UK. An advance copy was obtained by the Washington Post, which printed excerpts from it yesterday. </p> <p>According to Breslin, Pavarotti, now 68, described the celebrated soprano Dame Joan Sutherland, with whom he enjoyed a historic stage partnership that began in 1965, as \"pretty dopey\" if you ever had to talk to her. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, the renowned and supremely elegant German-born soprano, \"looked like a cleaning woman\" when she was out of costume. </p> <p>And of Placido Domingo, the Spanish tenor who, with Pavarotti and Jose Carreras formed the Three Tenors, sang at four World Cups, turned classical opera arias into huge popular hits and in one broadcast sang to a TV audience of 1.5 billion people, Pavarotti said: \"In his dreams, Placido never had a voice like mine.\" </p> <p>Doubleday's promotional blurb says Breslin \"moved Pavarotti out of the opera house, on to the concert (and the world) stage and into the arms of a huge mass public\". His manager for 36 years \"relates the tale in a brash, candid, witty fashion that is often bitingly frank and profane\", Doubleday says, describing the book as \"by turns affectionate and satirical ... full of hilarious details and tales out of school, with Pavarotti emerging as something like the ultimate Italian male\". </p> <p>According to the Washington Post, the book presents the singer as \"a petulant child who calls his associates 'stupido' and other terms of endearment; who denounces Domingo as a 'black marketeer' over supposed cruelties to Jose Carreras; who insists upon being chauffeured a single block from his New York apartment to his dentist\". </p> <p>The book relates how Pavarotti was so worried about the food on a tour of China that he had an entire restaurant packed up and transported across the ocean to feed him while he was there. Among other indiscretions, Breslin recounts the comings and goings of a great number of Pavarotti's \"secretaries\", and relates how the singer once described his soon-to-be second wife, Nicoletta Mantovani, as \"the favourite in my harem\". </p> <p>Born in Modena, Italy, on October 12 1935, Pavarotti was the first child and only son of a baker and was a promising footballer before he got bitten by the music bug after singing with his father in the Modena chorus (and winning first prize at the Llangollen international singing competition in Wales). He made his debut on April 29 1961, as Rodolfo in La Boheme, but it was not until February 1972 that the Pavarotti phenomenon was really born. </p> <p>In a production of Donizetti's La Fille du Regiment at New York's Metropolitan Opera, the tenor hit the nine high Cs of his aria so effortlessly that the audience apparently erupted into a spontaneous ovation. </p> <p>Since then, Pavarotti has made many of opera's leading tenor roles his own, performed in the world's most prestigious opera houses and become, in the words of his record label Decca, \"the most popular artist in the history of the classical recording industry\". </p> <p>According to the Washington Post, Breslin paints another - or, at least, complementary - story. During a career-long battle with his weight, Pavarotti \"has to have gained and lost more than 5,000lb\", his former manager writes. And in his screen debut, a 1982 romantic comedy called Yes, Giorgio universally acknowledged as awful, the singer was so concerned with his image that he \"wouldn't do anything that could make people laugh at him. Since he was ... the lead in a comedy, this became quite a problem.\" </p> <p>Breslin describes a key scene in the film in which Pavarotti and his co-star, Kathryn Harrold, engage in a food fight, throwing pasta and cheese at each other. \"Very few people would think of trying to play a food fight seriously, but Luciano did,\" writes Breslin. </p> <p>Pavarotti performed what he said was his last performance of a staged opera in New York in March. He had been expected to abandon opera (except for farewell recitals) from next year, but physical and vocal frailty - and, perhaps, some very bad reviews for his final three performances in Tosca at the Met - seem to have brought forward the decision. </p> <p>\"It was sad to hear him with such diminished energy,\" wrote Antoni Tommasini, the critic for the New York Times, in remarks worthy of the great man himself. </p> <p>\"It took so much concentration for Pavarotti simply to make his voice work that he essentially left matters of rhythm and pacing to chance.\"</p> <p><b>An alternative view of the stars</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b>Placido Domingo</b>, Pavarotti's longstanding friend and rival, has sung more than 120 different roles, more than any other tenor, and has over 100 recordings to his name. Born in Madrid, Domingo moved to Mexico at the age of eight. His operatic debut came at Monterrey as Alfredo in La Traviata in 1960. Now 68, he runs the LA and Washington Operas, and also conducts. His recent Siegmund in Wagner's Die Walk\u00fcre in Washington, seen by critics as a big risk so late in his career, was deemed a triumph. \"Tenors 25 years younger would be hard pressed to match it,\" wrote the New York Times critic. Newsweek magazine dubbed him the \"king of opera\" in a cover story </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The celebrated German-born soprano <b> Elizabeth Schwarzkopf</b> (pictured) retired from staged opera in 1971 after a career that began when she sang Eurydice in a school performance in Magdeburg, Germany in 1928. She joined the Deutsche Oper in 1938 (and soon afterwards the Nazi party, to keep her job). Her glittering career focused largely on five starring roles: Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, the Countess in Nozze di Figaro, the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier, Fiordiligi in Cosi fan tutte, and Countess Madeleine in Capriccio. </p> <p>She was naturalised as a British citizen in 1953 on marrying record producer and impresario Walter Legge, and made a dame of the British Empire in 1992. Famously, she chose her own performances on Desert Island Discs. </p> <p><b> <b>\u00b7</b> Dame Joan Sutherland</b> retired from opera in 1990 at the age of 64, ending a career that lasted almost 40 years. Born in Point Piper, New South Wales, in 1926, she studied as a mezzo-soprano at Covent Garden. In 1960, Italy named her \"La Stupenda\", following a performance of Handel's Alcina at Le Fenice in Venice. </p> <p>Her fabulous voice and sense of humour found fans around the world: the then mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, proclaimed May 6, 1998, Dame Joan Sutherland Day in the city of New York.</p>",
  "<p>Henri Cartier-Bresson, universally acknowledged as one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century, was buried yesterday, two days after his unannounced death at home in the south of France. He was 95. </p> <p>\"He had not been eating for several days. He grew gradually weaker,\" a family member told reporters from the photographer's summer home in the village of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. </p> <p>Cartier-Bresson, who gave up photography 30 years ago for his first love, painting and drawing, was the creator of 700,000 black-and-white photographs. He abhorred artificial lighting, including flash, never used a wide-angle lens, and never cropped his prints. </p> <p>A co-founder of the legendary Magnum photo agency, along with Robert Capa, David Seymour and George Rodger, he is seen today as the leader of that generation of photographers who succeeded in elevating what was until then a hobby, or at most a jobbing profession, into an art form. </p> <p>Among his most famous images, many of them on display at the foundation bearing his name that was opened in Paris last year, are the moustachioed, bowler-hatted man caught peeping through the canvas surround at a sports event in Brussels in 1932; a female prisoner denouncing a Gestapo informer in 1945; a boyish Truman Capote in 1947; and children playing on the Berlin wall in 1962. </p> <p>As a photojournalist, he had an astonishing ability to be in the right place at the right time: among the 1,000 original prints, as well as contact sheets, films, manuscripts and correspondence, at the foundation are shots taken during civil wars in Spain and Mexico, the communist revolution in China and at the death of Mahatma Gandhi in India. </p> <p>He was also a gifted portraitist, counting Jean-Paul Sartre, Carson McCullers, Bar bara Hepworth, Henri Matisse, Edith Piaf and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor among the famous names who sat for him. In 1954, he was the first western photographer allowed into the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin the previous year. </p> <p>Born in 1908, the son of a wealthy industrialist from Chanteloup, east of Paris, Cartier-Bresson took up photography in the 1930s: his first Leica (\"an extension of my eye\"), bought in 1932, was intended merely as an aid to his art. Much later he returned to this view, dismissing photography as \"un truc m\u00e9canique\" - a mechanical thing - and spending most of his time after 1974 drawing and copying paintings in Paris art galleries. </p> <p>But Cartier-Bresson's studies on design and proportion under the painter Andre Lhote, in the 1920s, proved fundamental to his photographic philosophy, as did his work on surrealism, a movement then at its height. </p> <p>From these two roots gradually grew his definition of what makes an exceptional image, the \"decisive moment\" - the name given to a major collection of his work in 1952. The \"decisive moment\", he said, was \"the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as the precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression\". </p> <p>Using one of the unobtrusive, fast-shooting cameras that became available from the 1930s, Cartier-Bresson began his hunt for the arresting image, setting the standard for every photojournalist who followed. He was, in his words, \"prowling the streets ... determined to trap life, to preserve life in the act of living\". </p> <p>Before the war he worked in eastern Europe, Spain and Mexico, and was assistant to the director Jean Renoir on a number of films. Cartier-Bresson was imprisoned by the Germans in 1940, but escaped three years later and witnessed the liberation of Paris. </p> <p>Cartier-Bresson would never nominate a favourite photograph of his own. But in a 2003 exhibition of his favourite works by others, pride of place went to a 1931 snap by the Hungarian Martin Munkacsi, portraying African boys playing in Lake Tanganyika. </p> <p>\"When I saw that photograph of Munkacsi, of the black kids running in a wave, I couldn't believe such a thing could be caught with the camera,\" he said. \"I said damn it, I took my camera, and I went out into the street.\"</p>",
  "Laura Spence, the state school pupil who was refused a place at Oxford University in 2000 despite a predicted string of A grades at A-level, today steps back into the political fray with an appeal to British students to consider taking their degree in America. <p>Ms Spence broke her three-year silence - during which she has gained a degree in biochemistry from Harvard - to urge sixth-formers to consider a US university education over a British one, claiming hers had made her \"substantially more well-rounded, confident and better prepared to make contributions to medicine\". </p> <p>She had to work harder than the American students to stay on top of coursework and essays, she said, but the results were worth it: American degrees are \"broader\" than British ones and campus life offered an \"astounding\" range of extra-curricular activities. </p> <p>Four years ago the then 18-year-old from Tyneside was at the centre of a political row over Oxford's admissions procedures after she had failed to secure a place to study medicine there despite being predicted a string of A grades in her A-levels. </p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, accused Oxford admissions tutors of \"old school tie\" elitism against pupils from state schools describing Magdalen College's decision an \"absolute scandal\". </p> <p>Ms Spence responded by turning her back on the British system and securing a $65,000 (\u00a337,000) scholarship to study biochemistry at Harvard in Massachusetts, from where she has now graduated with \"above average\" results. </p> <p>In an interview in today's Times Higher Education Supplement, Ms Spence says: \"The US-style 'liberal arts' education requires that each student learns a broader, more balanced curriculum while still achieving depth in their specialist subject. </p> <p>\"Unlike the more focused, professionally oriented UK degrees, this style of education is particularly suitable for students who don't want to limit themselves to specific career paths straight out of high school.\" </p> <p>She urged other students not to be put off by the cost of studying in America. \"While at first glance, tuition fees may seem astronomically prohibitive - $37,000 a year at Harvard - there are many forms of financial aid available. </p> <p>With the British government planning higher fees for students, it could become even more desirable, she added. </p> <p>Describing her transition from the British state school system to an American Ivy League university, she says: \"The style of education at Harvard was more of an adjustment for me than for American students,\" she said. She had to take extra courses to catch up in maths and foreign languages because she didn't have an A-level in them. </p> <p>Ms Spence has returned to the UK to take a postgraduate course in medicine with the aim of becoming a doctor. </p> <p>However, she refused to reveal which university she was planning to go to. Oxford University does offer a postgraduate degree in medicine but a spokesperson said they would not comment on individual students. </p> <p>A total of 8,000 British students opt to study in America every year. Numbers have dipped slightly with the introduction of the tougher visa application process since 2001.</p>",
  "<b>Filthy lucre</b> <br> <p><b>Oil, oil - everywhere!</b><br> </p> <p>Oil prices are soaring, stock markets are falling, the end of the world is nigh. Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the Indonesian president of Opec, has warned that the cartel will not be able to increase production to bring down prices, the rise in which has been fuelled by uncertainty over the future of Russian oil giant Yukos and attacks on pipelines in Iraq. Better fill up now before we hit $50 a barrel. </p> <p>The 11 members of Opec - Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela - supply more than 40% of the world's oil and have more than 75% of all proven reserves. They have us over a ... well, they've certainly got us where they want us. Yusgiantoro's statement may even be a bargaining ploy. So the answer, surely, is to start looking beyond Opec. </p> <p>Hampshire may be a good place to start. Last summer, Northern Petroleum struck oil near Winchester, between the A31 and A272, and it thinks the field could be good for 100m barrels. The company is also exploring widely in West Sussex and on the Isle of Wight. That's the spirit. The Campaign to Protect Rural England is objecting to drilling, but let's hope Northern's valiant efforts are not blocked by such stockbroker-belt nimbyism. </p> <p>And what about Rajasthan? Shell had more or less abandoned prospecting there, but oil minnow Cairn Energy made several major finds this year and reckons Rajasthan could be the new Texas; it has already found fields with an estimated 360m barrels of recoverable oil and is now planning exploration in Nepal. Cairn is run by former Scottish rugby international Bill Gammell; playing rugby for Scotland is the perfect pursuit for unquenchable optimists. Cairn invested $7.2m in the search for oil in Rajasthan; the find could be worth $500m. Gammell was recently named Scottish entrepreneur of the year. </p> <p>BP's latest Statistical Review of World Energy pinpoints reserves in improbable places: Denmark has 1.3bn barrels, Peru 1bn, Papua New Guinea 400m. Greece looks promising; Kazakhstan has huge potential (though there are fears that drilling could trigger earthquakes); the North Sea is by no means exhausted, with major new finds still being made; there are hopes that substantial reserves will be found in the Falklands; and \u00a335m is being spent on offshore exploration in North Wales.

There's a light brown and a light green, a rather soft green, a soft brown. <br> <b>JH:</b> Yes, sir. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> And they're real lightweight now and I need about six pairs for summerwear.<br> <b>JH:</b> Yes, sir. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> I want a couple, maybe three of the light brown kind of a almost powder colour like a powder on a lady's face. <br> [. . .] <b>JH:</b> Yes, sir. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> I need ... they're about a half a inch too tight in the waist. <br> <b>JH:</b> Do you recall, sir, the exact size? I just want to make sure we get them right for you. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> No, I don't know - you all just guessed at 'em, I think, some - wouldn't you have the measurement there? <br> <b>JH:</b> We can find it for you. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> Well, I can send you a pair. I want them half a inch larger in the waist than they were before, except I want two or three inches of stuff left back in there so I can take them up. I vary ten or 15 pounds a month. <br> <b>JH:</b> All right, sir. <br> [. . .] <b>LBJ:</b> Now the pockets, when you sit down, everything falls out, your money, your knife, everything, so I need at least another inch in the pockets. And another thing - the crotch, down where your nuts hang - is a little too tight, so when you make them up, give me an inch that I can let out there, uh, because they cut me, it's just like riding a wire fence. These are almost, these are the best I've had anywhere in the United States. <br> <b>JH:</b> Fine. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> But, uh, when I gain a little weight, they cut me under there. So, leave me ... you never have much of a margin there. See, if you can't leave me an inch from where the zipper (burps) ends, round, under my back to my bunghole, so I can let it out there if I need to. <br> <b>JH:</b> Right. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> Now, be sure you have the best zippers in them. These are good that I have. If you get those to me, I would sure be grateful. <br> <b>JH:</b> Fine. Now where would you like them sent, please? <br> <b>LBJ:</b> White House. <br></p> <p><b>Childish things</b><br> </p> <p><b>Don't play with me, dad</b><br> </p> <p>So children up to the age of 12 would rather play with their mothers, siblings, friends, grandparents, lumps of wood - anything other than their fathers, according to a poll commissioned by the Children's Play Council and the Children's Society. Apparently fathers lack imagination, are often at a loss as to how to play games - or are simply too competitive. \"Children will get fed up if they lose all the time,\" said Tim Gill, CPC's director. \"It's frankly demoralising and not much fun.\" </p> <p>Leaving aside questions of what the Children's Play Council is or does, and what Gill's office looks like (I imagine him wading to his desk through a sea of brightly coloured plastic balls), what we seem to have here is yet another pronouncement from the Department of the Bleeding Obvious. Of course fathers are rubbish at playing with their children. Children have suspect bowling actions, are easily fooled at most card games, and the rules of What's the Time, Mr Wolf? are, famously, of Byzantine complexity. </p> <p>The big issue is letting them win. The Competitive Dads who refuse to lower their game to the child's level are, basically, jerks. Those who always let little Timmy win lest his self-esteem takes a knock are, on the other hand, creeps. </p> <p>Personally, I steer a middle course by being genuinely atrocious at almost all sports, and playing left-handed at any for which I possess a shred of talent. The simplest technique involves avoiding playtime altogether, but this can be hard in the summer holidays and lead to rebuke. </p> <p>The trick is to find a game that you both like, and that it is important for youngsters to learn. Snooker is one. You can get a small table from Argos for a song. Pinball is another. Not all households can run to a pinball machine, but mine can, so nyaah. </p> <p>If all else fails, remember the way fathers are traditionally supposed to interact with their offspring. Your job is to puff on your pipe, look absent-minded for a minute or so, and then say: \"Ask your mother.\" Regardless of the question. <br> <b>Nicholas Lezard </b><br></p> <p><b>Foreign affairs</b><br> </p> <p><b>Arnie: the second act</b><br> </p> <p>It isn't easy to separate the businesses of being Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California and famous Austrian, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, action movie star, and former Mr Universe. Earlier this week, the governor settled a legal action against an Ohio firm for selling a bobble-headed likeness of him holding a gun. It was not the bobble-headed likeness that he objected to - the Bosley Bobbing Head Doll Co makes big-headed puppets of all sorts of people, including Bush and Hillary Clinton - rather, it was the machine gun that spooked Schwarzenegger's lawyers into action. Guns, it seems, are no longer part of the Terminator's arsenal. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see how the governor will react to Color Me Arnold: The Unofficial Arnold Schwarzenegger Coloring and Activity Book, to be published by Manic D Press, a San Francisco publisher, next month. Activities inside include connecting the dots to find Arnold groping a woman, colouring in the governor as Conan the Barbarian, and driving a Hummer from Hollywood to Sacramento. </p> <p>Co-author Lawrence Gipe says the book was inspired by the governor's own words and actions. \"It recontextualises the silliest of our governor's quotes - 'I think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman' - into the juvenile setting they deserve,\" he says. </p> <p>And yet, while Schwarzenegger's prop, in a costly new ad campaign, is a sober state flag (along with the caption \"Arnold says California Wants Your Business\"); while the Austrian post office has just announced that it will produce 600,000 stamps bearing his face (prominently labelled Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger); and while his official website celebrates the passage of California's balanced budget, it also promotes the release of his Predator movies on DVD: extras include an If It Bleeds, We Can Kill It: The Making of Predator documentary. </p> <p>It doesn't seem to hurt: his political coffers are filling up faster than those of any California governor before him, and he has raised $2m a month since January - more than enough to repay the debts incurred during last year's recall vote and to begin salting some away for his 2006 re-election campaign. And in fact, he still sees himself as the Terminator, as he admitted to an interviewer on Monday - \"because I'm relentless, and will not stop until something gets done\". <br> <b>Edward Helmore </b></p>",
  "<p>The Bolshoi is having a \"horse problem\" with its staging of Marius Petipa's The Pharaoh's Daughter at the Royal Opera House in London. The show involves a performing horse - but the company was barred from using a Russian one by quarantine laws. </p> <p>Tour manager Paul Godfrey lined up a local horse, only to find it had suffered an injury. \"We waited for it to get better but it wasn't to be,\" says Godfrey. \"I was offered one from the Royal Horse Guards,\" he adds, \"but its handler was in hospital.\" </p> <p>At the weekend, trick-rider and horse-handler Ian van Temperley came to the rescue, sending a horse from his company, Horsemen of the Apocalypse, in Wales. </p> <p>This wasn't the end of the saga, however.

When the horse arrived (named Todo, but known as Dobbin by the Bolshoi), he had to be inspected by Westminster Council's vet. </p> <p>\"You have to have the right horse for the job,\" explains Van Temperley. \"You need a horse that is not going to be spooked by the lights, or applause or a big noise from the orchestra.\" </p> <p>Todo, a veteran of Alton Towers's ice show and Carmen, was unfazed during rehearsals.

  "Eyewitnesses yesterday gave dramatic accounts of a series of coordinated anti-terrorist raids across England that led to 12 people being detained and questioned at the top-security Paddington Green police station in west London. <p>Relatives and neighbours expressed shock at the arrests and questioned the police tactics. Five people were arrested in Willesden, north London, one later released; one in Sudbury, north London; one in Wembley, north London; two in Paddington; two in Blackburn; one in Luton and one in Bushey, Hertfordshire. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Willesden, north London</b><br> Terence Costa, an immigration adviser, was just leaving his office above the Golden Touch barber's in Willesden High Road when his routine day was interrupted. In the flat above, on the top floor, David (who did not want to give his full name) had just given his 14-year-old daughter her lunch and, outside the barber's, the owner Steve was sitting in his girlfriend's car as he took a breather. </p> <p>David, glancing out of the window, saw them first: \"They came from both ends of the street; there were hundreds of armed police. They were running into the shops opposite, then these vehicles tore up the road and parked horizontally across the street.\" Seconds later Steve looked up and saw a young Asian man running towards his barber's shop. \"The police were chasing him. They shouted at me, 'Don't move, he's dangerous.' I thought, 'Oh no, he's heading for my shop.'\" </p> <p>As scores of officers shouting \"armed police\" pursued the man, a 10-year-old girl was knocked flying on the pavement. </p> <p>Mr Costa noticed none of this as he reached the doorway to the street and came face-to-face with the fleeing suspect. \"I had just reached the bottom of the stairs and this guy ran past me into the barber shop. He was about 23, he had short hair. I'd never seen him in the area before.\" </p> <p>Before he had a chance to register what was going on Mr Costa was confronted by police. \"All these officers came towards me carrying guns, they ordered me back up the stairs and into my office.\" </p> <p>Four anti-terrorist officers were left in Mr Costa's office as their colleagues charged up the next flight of steps and burst into David's flat, shouting: \"Armed police, get down now.\" </p> <p>\"Jess, my daughter was under the table, I just grabbed her and hit the floor,\" David said. \"She was screaming and crying.\" With the father and daughter face down on the floor, a few officers moved into the bedrooms and flipped over the beds in their search of the flat. \"Even the plumber who was working in the hallway was ordered into my flat and told to hit the floor.\" </p> <p>Eventually all three were allowed to stand up.\"I saw them leading this young guy out, they had wrapped him in a blue forensic suit and led him into a van.\" </p> <p>David said the officers had told him they had been watching the suspect and had decided to arrest him as he approached the barber's shop. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Bushey, Hertfordshire</b><br> In the leafy suburb of Bushey neighbours watched from behind curtains as forensic teams searched a detached house a few miles from the country club yesterday. </p> <p>Twenty-four hours earlier armed police had burst into the whitewashed property, known as the White House, and arrested 21-year-old Omar Rehman, whose father Mahmud is a wholesale fishmonger. </p> <p>A locksmith was busy yesterday repairing the damage as teams of police searched the house in Little Bushey Lane, in the heart of the stockbroker belt of Hertfordshire. Roger Walker, a neighbour, said the family, had lived next door to him for 14 years. </p> <p>\"They brought their children up here,\" he said. \"The daughter Sofia went to Watford grammar school. The son was a student and spent a lot of time at home. </p> <p>\"They are a lovely family, I see them to say hello to. They have always been very pleasant.\" </p> <p>A few weeks ago the Rehmans celebrated their daughter Sofia's wedding and neighbours said the 24-year-old newlywed was thought to still be on her honeymoon in Istanbul. </p> <p>\"I saw them all go off in a minibus. They were all dressed up,\" Mr Walker said. </p> <p>As residents cleaned their convertible sports cars on their driveways yesterday they expressed shock at the events of the past 24 hours. </p> <p>\"I saw the mother go off in her car in the morning and then went off to work as usual,\" Mr Walker said. </p> <p>\"When I came home about 2.45pm I saw all the police. There were about a dozen police and five vehicles. </p> <p>\"I asked them what was going on; they said it didn't concern me. This is normally such a quiet area.\" </p> <p>Neighbours said the two grown-up children had adopted more traditional Muslim dress and appeared to have become more religious over the past four years. </p> <p>Their father worked long hours in London, according to local people. \"He always left very early in the morning to go up to the city,\" one said. \"He is a charming man.\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Blackburn, Lancashire</b><br> Police from the Lancashire and Metropolitan forces raided four houses and a tyre depot in Blackburn yesterday after two men were arrested at gunpoint and pulled from a gold Mercedes in the town on Tuesday. </p> <p>Two of the raided premises, a modern semi in Malham Gardens, close to the tyre depot, and a terrace house in Shakeshaft Street, a few hundred metres away, were said to be the homes of or to be owned by two Asian businessmen. </p> <p>Local people named them as Butch Feroze and Zamir Hussain, but their identities have not been confirmed by police. </p> <p>The sources said the tyre depot, also searched by police, was run by Mr Feroze's elder brother Javaid. </p> <p>A house in Whalley New Road, believed to be his home, was searched by police. The fifth raid was at a quiet semi in Little Harwood, which a married couple and four young children were ordered to leave by officers bearing a search warrant. </p> <p>Mr Feroze and Mr Hussain were said to work together, buying and selling high- performance cars including Ferraris and Lamborghinis. \"If it is those two who have been arrested, it's absolutely ridiculous,\" said Mohammed Yusof, who works at an MOT centre next door to the Lower Audley Tyre Centre, which police raided late on Tuesday. Forensic teams continued searching there yesterday. </p> <p>\"They are Asian businessmen, that's all. I chill with them, I socialise with them. They would not have anything to do with terrorism or anything like that.\" </p> <p>At a pharmacy opposite the house in Whalley New Road, Tahir Shah said: \"Javaid is a very well respected businessman and a very hard worker. I'm always seeing him driving over to his garage first thing in the morning. He is the last person I would expect to be involved in terrorism.\" </p> <p>Soab Patel described how police had arrived at the newly extended home of his brother Ayub in Greenhead Avenue, and told him, his wife Hasena and their four young children to leave just before midnight. </p> <p>They told Ayub Patel, who was not arrested, that the family would have to stay with relatives or go to a hotel, an order which reduced Mrs Patel and her children to tears. </p> <p>\"My brother has been a businessman for 10 years,\" Soab Patel said. \"He has never been involved in any crime. I'm going to take this further - it's absolutely scandalous.\" </p> <p>Mr Patel told the officers they had a duty to search the house. \"But I told them, 'If you don't find anything, I want an apology. You are putting a label on our family. Who is going to remove it?'\" </p> <p><b> Luton, Bedfordshire</b><br> In Luton residents told how police halted a car as it pulled into their quiet, residential street and seized the driver at gunpoint. Witnesses said the man, described as of Asian origin, had been held trapped between the driver's door and the body of the car in driving rain for almost three hours. </p> <p>Lincoln Leslie, 71, had been painting the windows of his house in Alexandra Avenue, half a mile north of the town centre. The retired engineer said: \"Suddenly there were loads of police officers. I thought there must have been an accident until an officer armed with a machine gun walked up the road to redirect the traffic.\" </p> <p>Police sealed the area off. Mr Leslie said: \"The officers searched the man and appeared to be examining the car. They seemed to be talking into their radios as though they were waiting for instructions.\" Another witness, Greta Turner, 67, said: \"I saw it from my bedroom window. I saw three policemen with guns and knew it wasn't just a drug raid.\" </p> <p>Neighbours said the man, believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s, was eventually covered with a transparent plastic sheet and gloves, handcuffed and driven away. His car, thought to be a red Nissan, was taken away. </p> <p>After the arrest on Tuesday afternoon, officers stormed a flat in a modern block owned by a housing association in the Dallow Road area of Luton. One neighbour said: \"I looked through my peephole and saw loads of them in protective clothing and with riot shields and carrying a battering ram. There must have been more than 20 cops.\" </p> <p>The neighbour said a young man of Asian origin lived in the second floor flat with his wife or girlfriend. The neighbour said he believed the man was a decorator or plasterer. </p> <p>Two officers, one in uniform, the second in plainclothes, stood guard outside the door of the flat last night. Another officer left the flat carrying a police evidence bag containing computer disks and documents. </p> <p>Members of the Muslim community in Luton expressed concern. Community leaders were told of the operation as it began. But some Muslims are still smarting from raids carried out on six homes in March which attracted widespread publicity, but resulted in no arrests. </p> <p>Akbar Dad Khan of the group Building Bridges, which promotes harmony between faiths, said: \"There is real concern that the police are misusing the anti-terrorism laws. The authorities risk alienating our community.\"</p>",
  "The bald Home Office figures appear at first sight to tell a story of failure. Since September 11 2001 there have been 562 people arrested under the powers in the Terrorism 2000 Act. So far 97 of them have been charged and only 14 have actually been convicted. <p>But both the police and prosecution authorities stress that those figures do not tell the whole story and should be treated with caution. </p> <p>Ken Macdonald, the director of public prosecutions, has told MPs that he believes they are potentially mislead ing because there are a large number of anti-terrorism cases yet to come to court. </p> <p>\"So far as the discrepancy between the number of people arrested and the number of people charged is concerned, as a prosecutor that does not surprise me at all,\" he said in evidence to the joint human rights committee inquiry into the terrorism acts published yesterday. </p> <p>\"The test for arresting somebody is reasonable suspicion on the part of the police officer. We are always going to be consulted by the police as to what the charge should be. The test we apply is a much higher test and there is always going to be some wastage at that point.\" </p> <p>Mr Macdonald also said that quite often people who were arrested for terrorist offences are then prosecuted under other legislation. </p> <p>The Home Office confirmed yesterday that 152 people of the 562 arrested under the Terrorism Act were charged under other legislation or released into the custody of the immigration service. </p> <p>In fact the more accurate picture is that 280 out of the 562 people arrested under anti-terrorist powers since September 11 2001 have been released without charge - about half of those who have been taken in. </p> <p>The DPP said some of those charged under other legislation were often prosecuted for false identity offences or credit card frauds. </p> <p>Mike Todd, Manchester's chief constable and spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers on terrorism, has also claimed that it is wrong to characterise terrorism arrests as a failure if not everyone involved is charged. </p> <p>\"I do not necessarily regard that as a failure. Often it is a disruption, a deterrent,\" he recently told MPs. </p> <p>In April, in an operation led by Greater Manchester police, 10 people were arrested in a series of anti-terror raids. The nine men and one woman were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism - but all were subsequently released without charge.</p>",
  "Five of Britain's category A jails are being equipped with a new biometric security system to scan the fingerprints of tens of thousands of visitors and prisoners. Matching photographs will also be stored. <p>Deployment of the Inmate Management System (IMS), which already features at a few privately-run institutions, is being expanded after development at two prisons and an immigration detention centre. </p> <p>The access-control procedure, devised by a London firm, Unilink Systems and Software, is intended to speed up the processing of visitors and ensure inmates do not escape by swapping places with visitors. Banned visitors can be more easily excluded and suspicious patterns of visits tracked. </p> <p>IMS will be installed at Woodhill, near Milton Keynes - where it goes live this week - as well as at Belmarsh, Manchester, Long Lartin, and Whitemore. All are high-security jails holding many of the most dangerous inmates, including terrorist suspects. </p> <p>The procedure, which the Home Office prefers to call a \"visitor recognition system\", saves records of visitors' fingerprints and their photographs on local computers. There is no plan at present to link all the jails' computers into a single network. </p> <p>The Home Office has not revealed the cost of the contract, agreed in a closed tender process, but it is thought to be about \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>The scans replace a biometric system that recorded the shape, or geometry, of hands. The Guardian understands that that system was scrapped because the computer response time slowed down as more records were stored. Several reports by the chief inspector of prisons criticised delays at Belmarsh caused by the procedure. The Home Office refused to reveal how much this previous system, installed in 1996, had cost. </p> <p>Electronic fingerprint scanning is increasingly popular for systems verifying identity which need to handle large numbers of people. The US uses similar methods, imposed after the September 11 attacks, for airport arrivals. </p> <p>Alternative biometric security checks using electronic scans of the iris were rejected both because the technology was too expensive - it is still under patent - and because it was thought too intrusive for visitors and inmates. </p> <p>Bronzefield, a women's jail, in Ashford, Middlesex, which opened in June and is run by the private firm UKDS, is the latest example of the enthusiasm for biometric security. It is equipped with an IMS, that also registered the staff. New visitors to the jail are photographed and electronic scans are taken of their left and right index fingers. There are nine scanners in the prison. </p> <p>\"The prisoners have been very happy with the system,\" said Dave Mcaulay, of UKDS. \"They can see the benefits of a system which streamlines the process. It's improved the efficiency of visits. If you get an ex-inmate coming in to visit the system can flash up if there's a record on their file of assaulting staff. It can help us.\" </p> <p>Staff insist there are no privacy implications since such information is already stored on the Prison Service's local inmate data system. </p> <p>The system's optical scanner records the information from the fingerprints as an algorithm. \"It measures the distances between the whorls in the fingerprint pattern,\" said Peter Whitaker, of Unilink, \"but it does not have enough information to reconstruct an image of a fingerprint.\" </p> <p>The system at Bronzefield already has 18,000 matching fingerprints and pictures. Staff say it pulls up information on prisoners and visitors almost instantaneously. Theoretically, scanners could also be used to control access to the prison's wings, though the Home Office says it has no plans for that. </p> <p>There has been some discussion about installing the system in courts to ensure that the correct prisoner goes on trial. At Harmondsworth immigration detention centre, near Heathrow, also run by UKDS and using IMS to monitor visits, there was a recent escape attempt by a detainee who tried to swap places with a visitor, according to Francis Toye, a director of Unilink. </p> <p>\"In France last year there was an inmate who swapped places with his twin and escaped,\" Mr Toye said. \"We believe our system makes prisons easier places to run.\" </p> <p>Fingerprint scanners can be fooled. A Japanese professor used gelatine to transfer a copy of someone else's prints on to his finger. The resources for such techniques are unlikely to be available in prison.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Strapless goggles</strong><br>Nike has developed the first strapless swimming goggles, which consist of a pair of independent lenses that stick to the eye socket using medical glue.

There are also breathable uppers and a silver plate that helps to reflect the heat of the track surface. </p> <p><strong>Power socks</strong><br>Part of the British team kit and a favourite of Paula Radcliffe, the Adidas Power Sock conserves athletes' energy by reducing muscle vibration in the calves each time the foot strikes the ground at speed. \"The vibrations that result are an unnecessary waste of energy,\" says Adidas's Ciro Fusco, \"but they can be limited by compression.\" </p> <p><strong>Precool vest</strong><br>A jacket that contains ice packs in its lining to cool the body in the anticipated 40C heat of Athens. The idea is for endurance athletes to wear the Nike Precool vest for an hour before their event starts, to lower their core body temperature by 19% and as a result reduce the risk of debilitating heat injury.</p>",

Ahead is the small task of running 26.2 miles with the weight of a nation's expectation on your shoulders; an Olympic gold medal with your name on it dangles tantalisingly at the finish line. What is a girl to wear on such an occasion? </p> <p>Radcliffe's wardrobe has, in fact, been sorted for months, the culmination of years of scientific research. Nothing off the peg for Britain's golden girl - each item uses cutting-edge technology to assist her quest for glory. As well as the tailor-made trainers developed by her sponsors, Nike, her ensemble includes featherweight, carbon eyewear to reflect the sun's glare; knee-length power socks to reduce leg fatigue by minimising muscle vibration, and British team kit which, according to its maker, Adidas, \"is designed to act like a personal air-conditioning system\", using specially constructed fabrics to take sweat away from the skin. </p> <p>An hour before running, Radcliffe will model a Precool vest which discreetly holds ice packs in its lining to reduce core body temperature by 19% and minimise heat injury risk. On the bridge of her nose she will place a sticking plaster, proven to increase nasal air flow during intense exercise. </p> <p>Radcliffe is not alone in using science to enhance her performance. Olympic competition is now as much a battle of technological expertise among sports manufacturers as it is of human endeavour. In Athens, expect to witness the world's best runners, swimmers and cyclists in skin-tight catsuits and wearing sprint shoes with springs in the heel. </p> <p>Of the big players in sports goods manufacturing, most are cagey about how much they invest in the research and development of clothing and equipment for elite athletes. But both Adidas and Nike admit that they employ more than 30 full-time designers and scientists, many of whom spend each four-year Olympic cycle working on an individual shoe or swimsuit, as well as recruiting experts from other professions to work on particular projects. Much of what the big companies produce for top-level sportspeople is too specific and too expensive for the mass market (some sprint shoes, costing \u00a3300, are good for only one race). But seeing their logo on the feet of an Olympic champion means priceless exposure. </p> <p>Of primary concern in Athens is reducing body heat in the searing temperatures, preventing a debilitating effect on energy levels and performance. As the designer of Great Britain's team kit, Adidas began consulting scientists four years ago to create the ClimaCool fabrics now used in every item. In the initial stages, George Havenith, a physiologist at Loughborough University's department of human science and an expert in heat and cold stress, conducted body-mapping studies to determine \"the precise sweat and cooling patterns of athletes exposed to similar conditions that they will face in Athens\". With 2-3m sweat glands around the body, Havenith wanted to \"see how and where most sweat was produced during intense activity\". </p> <p>He and his colleagues also analysed how specific areas of the body cope with hotter and cooler temperatures, whether body fat deposits significantly increase the rate at which heat is pushed through to the body's core. \"We provided information to help Adidas produce clothing to aid sweat evaporation from skin - the body's internal cooling mechanism,\" says Havenith. </p> <p>Each item of the team's kit features hundreds of tiny indents on the body side of the fabric that pull sweat outwards, along with an in-built ventilation chimney on vests that, says another consultant, Steve Ingham of the Olympic Medical Institute in Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, \"raises it from the skin so that heat can escape more easily\". </p> <p>For swimmers, research is no less rigorous. At the cutting edge of pool attire is Speedo's Fastskin II all-in-one suit, claimed to be the \"world's fastest swimsuit\". Although this largely depends on which swimmer it adorns, its credentials are impressive. Working with Oliver Crimmen, a resident shark expert in the fish department of the Natural History Museum, Speedo's designers came up with a fabric that simulates the scales, dermal denticles and overall texture of shark's skin to reduce the drag in the water that slows a swimmer. Using life-sized virtual dummies of world champion swimmers, created by the same Hollywood special effects team that worked on films such as Spider-Man and The Matrix, scientists proved the suit raised performance by up to 4%. </p> <p>\"With computational fluid dynamics we could mathematically build a water flume inside our computer,\" says scientist Barry Bixler, who led the trials. \"We analysed flow, with incredibly consistent results enabling us to produce specific swimsuits for specific swimming events.\" </p> <p>Construction delays in Athens meant that the roof planned to cover the pool was never built, and experts were concerned that the sun's glare would damage swimmers' eyes, particularly the vulnerable retina. Speedo is one of several companies to produce goggles with titanium lenses, providing up to 60% more protection than normal. Meanwhile, Nike has made the world's first strapless goggles that affix to the eye socket with medical glue and further reduce drag. </p> <p>Back on the track, it is a British designer, Eddie Harber, now based at Nike's design headquarters in Oregon, who has spent six years refining the company's Olympic showpiece, the Swift Suit, for Australian and American athletes. Accounting for everything from predicted wind flow through stadia to athletes' hairstyles, Harber has shown that, in order to reach top speed, exposed skin and body hair should be kept under wraps: the hooded, head-to-ankle outfit with stirrups on the feet and sleeves that extend to cover part of the hands is his aerodynamic solution. Tests conducted in a wind tunnel on two mannequins - one wearing a Swift Suit and one in ordinary vest and shorts - showed that \"the suit produced 1lb [454g] less drag when running at the same speed and gave a 10cm advantage in a 100m sprint\". Ten centimetres? That is barely the width of a man's palm. \"Yes,\" he says. \"But it could be the difference between winning a medal or not.\"</p>",
  "The main UN aid agency in Gaza is evacuating most foreign staff citing security concerns after Israeli forces pushed deeper into the northern part of the coastal strip, a spokesman said yesterday. <p>The UN relief and works agency, which cares for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in Gaza, said it was pulling out 19 staff in addition to the 20 ordered out last month, leaving only nine foreign workers. </p> <p>A spokesman, Johan Eriksson, said: \"The main reason [for the evacuation] is the expanding Israeli operation in northern Gaza.\" Tanks sealed off the Gaza town of Beit Hanoun more than a month ago after Palestinian militants killed two Israelis in a rocket attack across the border. </p> <p>Palestinians have waged an uprising against Israeli occupation since September 2000. The army widened its operation on Tuesday night to drive rocket squads out of range of an Israeli border town that has been a frequent target. Israeli forces pushed to the edge of the Jabalya refugee camp yesterday, a day after masked gunmen from the militant group Hamas issued a taped warning of further rocket attacks. </p> <p>Violence has surged in Gaza since the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, unveiled a plan to evacuate soldiers and Jewish settlers by the end of next year. Gunmen demanding that the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, root out corruption briefly abducted four French aid workers last month. </p> <p>Days later the UN said it was removing non-essential foreign staff.</p>",
  "<p>Laura Spence, the straight-A state-school pupil who was denied a place at Oxford University in 2000, today stepped back into the political fray with an appeal to British students to consider taking their degree in America. </p> <p>Since Ms Spence found herself at the centre of a row over Oxford admissions four years ago, she has gained a degree in biochemistry from Harvard. </p> <p>Now she is urging sixth-formers to consider a US university education over a British one, as her experience has made her \"substantially more well-rounded, confident and better prepared to make contributions to medicine,\" she said.</p> <p>Ms Spence said that she had to work harder than the American students to stay on top of coursework and essays, but the results were worth it: American degrees are \"broader\" than British ones and campus life offered an \"astounding\" range of extra-curricular activities, she said. </p> <p>Four years ago, the then 18-year old from Tyneside was at the heart of a political row over Oxford's admissions procedures, after she failed to secure a place to study medicine despite getting five As for her A-levels. </p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, stepped in, accusing Oxford admissions tutors of \"old school tie\" elitism against pupils from state schools, and labelled Magdalen College's decision an \"absolute scandal\".</p> <p>Ms Spence responded by turning her back on the British system and securing a $65,000 (\u00a335,000) scholarship to study biochemistry at Harvard in Massachusetts, from where she has now graduated with \"above average\" results. </p> <p>In an interview in today's Times Higher Education Supplement, Ms Spence said: \"The US-style 'liberal arts' education requires that each student learns a broader, more balanced curriculum whilst still achieving depth in their specialist subject. </p> <p>\"Unlike the more focused, professionally oriented UK degrees, this style of education is particularly suitable for students who don't want to limit themselves to specific career paths straight out of high school.\" </p> <p>She urged other students not to be put off by the cost of studying in America. \"While at first glance, tuition fees may seem astronomically prohibitive - $37,000 (\u00a320,000) a year at Harvard - there are many forms of financial aid available.</p> <p>\"At Harvard, financial aid is needs-based, so if the admissions office wants to offer you a place, the financial aid office makes sure you have sufficient support through grants, loans and part-time jobs.\"</p> <p>With the British government planning higher fees for students, the option of study in America could become even more desirable, she added. </p> <p>Describing her transition from the British state school system to an American ivy league university, she said: \"The style of education at Harvard was more of an adjustment for me than for American students.\" </p> <p>Ms Spence had to take extra courses to catch up in maths and foreign languages because she did not have an A-level qualification in those subjects.</p> <p>\"With many hours of scheduled classes, multiple homework sets and essays each week, I felt substantially more overworked than I had done at A-level. </p> <p>\"Many students from competitive American high schools thought the Harvard workload was quite relaxed.\"</p> <p>Despite this situation, Ms Spence engaged in an \"astounding\" range of extracurricular activities. </p> <p>\"A substantial proportion of college learning takes place in these social experiences and challenges outside the classroom - from pre-law societies and volunteer organisations to rowing teams and orchestras.\"</p> <p>Ms Spence has now returned to the UK to take a postgraduate course in medicine with the aim of achieving her original ambition to become a doctor. </p> <p>However, she refused to reveal which university she was planning to attend. </p> <p>Oxford University does offer a postgraduate degree in medicine but a spokesperson said that they would not comment on individual students.</p> <p>A total of 8,000 British students opt to study in America every year, though numbers have dipped slightly with the introduction of the tougher visa application process since 2001.</p>"
