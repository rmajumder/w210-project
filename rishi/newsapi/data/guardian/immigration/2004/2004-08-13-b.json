  "Today marks the halfway point in the UN security council's 30-day ultimatum to the government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias, responsible for what is commonly described as the world's worst humanitarian disaster. Already it is apparent that the response of the Islamist regime will be to continue bluffing it out with protests of injured innocence in the hope that the international community eventually gives up and loses interest. <p>Daily reports of attacks against civilians continue to come in from across Darfur; 30,000 people are said to have fled in the latest round of violence. But far from restraining the militias, the government is providing continued military support for their campaign of ethnic terror. In the past week the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that helicopter gunships had again been used in attacks; and the traumatised victims of earlier atrocities, crammed into refugee camps, continue to suffer violent assaults by the Janjaweed, often under the nose of Sudanese troops supposed to protect them. This is not a little local difficulty; it is a war waged by the government against its people. </p> <p>To the extent that the authorities have acted at all, it has been to cover up evidence of what is happening. Instead of being disarmed and disbanded, the militias are being integrated into the security forces where they will be less conspicuous. Refugees are being pressured to return to their villages with threats of violence or offers of desperately needed food, only to become victims once again. Those who speak to international observers are being rounded up and imprisoned, according to Amnesty International. And aid workers attempting to get supplies to those most at risk from malnutrition and disease are reporting new government-imposed restrictions on their operations. Everything that is being done is a calculated play for time. </p> <p>The reaction of the Khartoum regime is scarcely surprising. Little of what the international community has done suggests that the political will exists for any meaningful intervention. The watering down of security council resolution 1556, as a result of pressure from several states, will not have been lost on Sudan's rulers. While the original draft contained an explicit threat of sanctions, the final version did little more than vaguely promise to \"consider further actions\" in the event of non-compliance. This will have been interpreted, correctly, as a sign of weakness and an indication that little is likely to be done when the UN deadline expires. </p> <p>Those of the \"nothing must be done\" persuasion dismiss outside intervention as irresponsible or malevolent, and probably both. Not one of them has suggested a credible way for this hopelessly one-sided conflict to be resolved except for it to run its bloody course. They are entitled to their position, but they are not entitled to deny its human consequences. </p> <p>Splitting hairs over the definition of genocide or quibbling over how many thousands have been killed doesn't alter the fact that serious crimes against humanity are being committed with every passing day. Nor does the argument that the militias are beyond Khartoum's control. Disputes about whether the regime is orchestrating the violence or has simply lost control of events are unimportant when set against the suffering in Darfur. States that fail to protect the human rights of their own citizens forfeit the sovereign right to non-interference in their internal affairs. Without that principle, the universal declaration of human rights isn't worth the paper it's written on. </p> <p>Unfortunately, as Darfur illustrates, the UN system is singularly ill-suited to upholding its own stated values. Four of the countries that forced the threat of sanctions to be removed from the security council resolution - Russia, China, Pakistan and Algeria - have extremely poor human rights records. Two are permanent members with the power of veto, commercial ties to the Sudanese government and a strong interest in defending the inviolability of state sovereignty against the humanitarian imperative. Why do they enjoy this privilege? Because almost 60 years ago they happened to be on the winning side in a war. </p> <p>The veto power of the other permanent members is no less anomalous and no less hypocritical in the uses to which it has been put. America has exercised its veto on 79 occasions, most frequently to shield Israel from international criticism. It has also used the veto to avoid censure for its aggression against Nicaragua, the invasion of Grenada and other misdeeds. Britain and America, with occasional French support, performed the same service for apartheid South Africa throughout the 70s and 80s. With these rules, the aspiration for global justice will always lose out to the reality that there is one law for the \"great powers\" and their client states, and another law for the rest. </p> <p>Tony Blair's ambition to establish a new \"doctrine of international community\" with human rights as its central focus is struggling to make progress in the face of widespread international scepticism. Not all this is due to the fallout over Iraq. Some of it is also prompted by the fact that Blair's apparent enthusiasm for reform does not extend to asking whether it is still legitimate for Britain or any other country to insist that its own interests should take precedence over international law. </p> <p>If he really wanted to push a radical agenda, he could do worse than propose that the power to impose sanctions and authorise the use of military force should be exercised by the UN membership as a whole. The general assembly has its problems, but is a far more representative body than the security council and is becoming more so with the passage of time. The days when its membership consisted largely of the representatives of military juntas and one-party states are long gone. The remarkable progress of democratic ideas in Latin America, eastern Europe and parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa over the past two decades means that two-thirds of UN members now have elected governments. There is every reason to believe that this figure will continue to rise. Isn't it time for the world body to shake off the colonial assumptions on which it was founded? </p> <p>When the security council meets at the end of the month to consider Sudan's compliance with resolution 1556, the result is likely to be more paralysis and inaction. If Blair's reaction is to bemoan the unreasonable and unprincipled resort to the politics of the veto, someone should remind him that it's his system too. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>David Clark was a special adviser at the Foreign Office from 1997 to 2001 </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:dkclark@aol.com\">dkclark@aol.com</a></p>",
  "Security officials in Baghdad were last night urgently investigating the background of 30 Iranians who were caught fighting for a rebel Shia cleric in Iraq, amid mounting concern over the involvement of the Tehran regime in the uprising. <p>The Guardian has learned that the most senior members of the Iraqi government were briefed about the capture of the men yesterday, and also told of other evidence that fighters and equipment have been crossing the border from Iran. </p> <p>The 30 men were captured in the southern city of Kut on Wednesday and officials are trying to establish whether they have any links to Tehran. </p> <p>\"We are checking their identities but if they are found to have links to the Iranians then that would be tantamount to a declaration of war by them,\" said a senior Iraqi source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>The source said members of Iraq's national security committee had yesterday been presented \"with revealing information about the extent of Iranian involvement in Iraqi affairs\", which was being taken seriously at the \"highest echelons of government\". </p> <p>There was increasing frustration \"at our neighbour's apparent indifference to cross-border security, despite promises of cooperation\". </p> <p>The source said two trucks laden with weapons destined for the fighters of the militant cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, had been stopped at the Iranian border on Wednesday night. </p> <p>Sabbah Kaddim, a senior adviser at the ministry of the interior, declined to confirm the seizure of the two trucks or the arrest of the Iranians. But he confirmed \"there were a number of non-Iraqi elements\" captured in Kut. </p> <p>He added: \"There has been a continuous stream of vehicles over the last few weeks trying to ferry arms across the border from Iran. </p> <p>\"We catch some, others must get through. The trouble is knowing who exactly is behind all this.\" </p> <p>The violence between US and Iraqi forces and Mr Sadr's supporters has destabilised Shia areas of the capital and several cities across southern Iraq where Iranian influence is at its strongest. </p> <p>Baghdad knows the unrest poses a critical test of strength for the interim administration of Ayed Allawi, whose success will be judged on the ability to deliver a secure environment in which to hold the country's first post-Saddam elections, scheduled for next January. </p> <p>Iran denies stirring up violence in Iraq. It says it does not knowingly let fighters cross the long border between the two countries, but accepts that some might cross illegally. </p> <p>Foreign fighters account for only a fraction of the insurgents in detention in Iraq. </p> <p>Relations between Iran and Iraq, who fought a ruinous war from 1980-88, have plummeted in recent weeks. Iran yesterday summoned Iraq's top envoy in Tehran over the alleged arrest in Iraq of several reporters from Iran's state news agency and the fate of a kidnapped Iranian diplomat. Iran also denounced the assault by US marines and Iraqi forces in the holy Iraqi city of Najaf as \"inhumane and horrible\". </p> <p>Foreign diplomatic observers in Baghdad have been alarmed by the \"stoking up of tension\" between the two neighbours. One senior diplomat said the Iranians were pursuing their activities in Iraq \"more aggressively than three months ago, and they were hardly passive then\". </p> <p>Some foreign diplomats, however, question whether Iran would be able to do anything in Iraq than other than \"stir things up a bit\". </p> <p>\"Iranians will never be fully trusted by a majority of the Shia in Iraq,\" said one, suggesting there was not much the Iraqi government could do other than keep relations at a manageable level and allow the \"game to play out in Iran, between those who want to help Iraq and those extremists who want to see the whole thing fail\". </p> <p>The differences among hawks and doves on the Iranian side are mirrored in the administration of Mr Allawi, some of whom represent political parties with ties to Tehran. </p> <p>The Iraqi finance minister, Adel Abdel Mahdi, a senior member of the Supreme Council for Islamic revolution in Iraq, described cooperation between Iran and Iraq as \"positive\" after he led a large delegation to Tehran last week to attend a conference on reconstruction. Iran was one of the first to recognise the new Iraqi government and has also invited the interim prime minister Mr Allawi for an official visit. </p> <p>An interior ministry official said yesterday: \"We do have problems, but we believe that we can take the problems to the Iranian side and discuss them. </p> <p>\"The invitation was something of a surprise but it perhaps is an acknowledgment that Iran realises that things could get out hand in the south. It is not in their interests for there to be chaos. Many many Iraqi Shia are against what Moqtada al-Sadr are doing, and the sensible elements of the Iranian government know that. We believe we can develop better relations if we are honest with one another.\" </p> <p>But one Iraqi diplomat, a former member of the Iraqi opposition who took part in the postwar planning, said: \"You know we didn't misread the reaction of the Shia in postwar Iraq, as many analysts have suggested; our big failing was to misread the reaction from our neighbours. They really don't want to give us a chance.\"</p>",
  "<p>World oil prices reached record highs yesterday over fears of disruption to Iraqi supplies and continued concern about the fate of the troubled Russian oil group Yukos. </p> <p>The closure of a quarter of the fields in the Gulf of Mexico over fears of damage from tropical storm Bonnie added to the worries about insufficient global supply to meet roaring demand. </p> <p>US light crude futures shot up 86 cents a barrel during the trading session to $45.66, a record in the 21-year history of the Nymex exchange. Brent futures rose a similar amount to a record $42.27 a barrel. Oil prices are now up more than a third this year and 20% since the end of June alone, with many analysts predicting $50 a barrel within weeks. </p> <p>\"Everything's gone wrong in the oil market recently. If you wanted to paint the worst-scenario picture, you could not do much better,\" said David Thurtell, a commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. </p> <p>On Wednesday, oil prices retreated on a new promise from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, to pump more crude but shot up again as militants in Iraq threatened to blow up pipelines in the south of the country if US forces stormed the city of Najaf. </p> <p>The US forces launched their attack yesterday in an effort to root out militiamen loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr. </p> <p>The Iraqi government, which had closed pipelines earlier this week because of sabotage, reopened them. </p> <p>It said it would resume exports immediately. Iraq pumps about 1.7 m barrels a day, or about 2% of world output. </p> <p>That news was sufficient to push prices back from their records, as was news from several oil majors that Bonnie had passed and workers were returning to oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>",
  "<p>VIEIRA: I'M STAYING</p> <p>Knowing a bit about Real Madrid's marketing policy and their racist Ultra Sur fans, the Fiver's fairly confident that if Patrick Vieira looked like a supermodel he would now be gingerly towelling himself down at the Bernabeu next to his fellow galaticos. But today, having \"spent the summer considering my future and a possible move to Real Madrid,\" Vieira decided that Real's paltry wage offer, sorry, his \"love for Arsenal\" was enough to keep him at Highbury.</p> <p>\"I'm proud to be captain of the club and I'm looking forward to achieving my ambitions,\" the Arsenal captain added, breaking a silence that would've done Chaplin, circa 1926, proud. More churlish folk than us would suggest these \"ambitions\" have usually included trying to do one - after all, Pat's been linked with Real in three of the last four years (\"I do not honestly see Arsenal finishing in the top five - and you can forget the Big Cup\" in 2001) while, according to Sir Alex Ferguson, Vieira wanted to join United in 2002 \"but Arsenal wouldn't let him\".</p> <p>Still, you can't blame Arsene Wenger for being delighted that the best defensive midfielder in the world has decided to stay put in N5 after all. \"I am of course very pleased,\" Wenger gushed like the Ganges in monsoon season. \"We were in a situation where we could lose a very big player at a period of the season where it would be impossible to replace him. And [it's good] for the confidence of the fans too - for them it would have been a big blow.\" Perhaps. But surely not every Arsenal fan will be delighted at Vieira's shabby treatment of the club - again - will they?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I suppose a lot will be made of the fact that I'm 34 but while I'm struggling a bit with keeping my hair, really I'm still just a young boy\" - Alan Shearer is losing more than his hair, isn't he?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>EL MICKY</strong></p> <p>When Michael Owen was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 2001, the prospect of him being sold for less than \u00a310m seemed as likely as Mo Mowlam becoming the face of Chanel. At one point, \u00a340m was mentioned. But with Owen's contract running down and his hamstrings twanging more than John Squire's guitar during I Am The Resurrection, his value has plummeted. Then, today, raffish Rafa Benitez revealed that Owen is definitely off to Real Madrid - and, frankly, he looked about as crestfallen as a lottery winner guzzling ice-cool Hoegaarden in a jacuzzi with Girls Aloud.</p> <p>\"I wanted him to stay,\" quipped Benitez, sniggering like a teatime email hack at his own joke. \"[But] the end it was an impossible situation to control. The money from his sale will be used to balance the team.\" It's a good deal for Owen, too. He's been far too one-dimensional for far too long and, if he can't improve his game alongside world-class players like Zidane and Ronaldo, then this clich\u00e9 doesn't deserve to be written. He might even learn how to take a penalty.</p> <p>And it's certainly a good deal for Antonio Nunez, who has been thrown into the deal as a sweetener. \"We think it's a great move to a very professional club,\" warbled his Mr 10%. \"It's very important that they wanted him.\" Clearly nobody else did: though he's 25, Nunez never started a La Liga game for Real. He's about as much of a galactico as Des Lyttle. \"He is hard working, quick and could help cover the absence of [Vladimir] Smicer on the right,\" cooed his agent. The new Smicer?

  "A former head of MI5 will play a key role in the government's new \"British FBI\", the home secretary, David Blunkett announced today. <p>Sir Stephen Lander was named chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - the first time an ex-spymaster has played such a crucial role in British policing. </p> <p>Sir Stephen had a 25-year career in the Security Service and served as director general from 1996 to 2002. </p> <p>He takes up the \u00a3120,000-a-year post at Soca - which unites police and other investigators in a war against organised criminals including drug smugglers, people traffickers and internet paedophiles - next month. </p> <p>As chairman he will be responsible for \"setting the organisation's vision and overall strategy,\" said a Home Office spokesman. </p> <p>The current head of the National Crime Squad, Bill Hughes, was named director general of Soca and will be in operational control of its investigations. </p> <p>In what is expected to be one of the most high-profile jobs in British policing, Mr Hughes will clamp down on \"Mr Bigs\" and their criminal henchmen. </p> <p>The 53-year-old former deputy chief constable of Hertfordshire police will be paid up to \u00a3150,000 a year. Soca is due to come into operation in April 2006, subject to legislation being passed. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said: \"Sir Stephen has considerable experience of the management of intelligence, decisive leadership and a proven track record of public service which make him an exceptional asset to the organisation. </p> <p>\"Mr Hughes has a proven career in the police service and in managing the police response to serious and organised crime. </p> <p>\"Together they will give strategic vision and firm direction to this ground-breaking new organisation.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Organised crime is big business. As criminals become more sophisticated, so we must raise our game to fight it. We must make better use of technology to stay ahead. </p> <p>\"The creation of a single agency to tackle organised crime marks a step change in our efforts to reduce the harm it does to the UK and its citizens.\" </p> <p>Sir Stephen said: \"The creation of the Soca will build on the considerable strengths of the existing national agencies and will provide the country with a single body focused on reducing the harm caused by organised crime. </p> <p>The Tories gave the appointments a cautious welcome. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the \"devil was in the detail\" and that the new body should not be a drain for the \"brightest and best\" staff from regional police forces.</p> <p> With about 5,000 investigators, Soca will merge Mr Hughes' current outfit, the National Crime Squad, with the National Criminal Intelligence Service and investigation units at Customs and Excise and the immigration service. </p> <p>A slice of the extra cash secured from the Treasury in the latest comprehensive spending review - boosting Home Office expenditure from \u00a317.3bn in 2004-2005 to \u00a320.1bn in 2007-2008 - will be spent on creating the new agency. </p> <p>In March, Mr Blunkett announced details of new powers which he wants to hand Soca officers. </p> <p>Criminal \"godfathers\" could be forced to hand over their bank statements for up to a decade after release from jail to prove they have gone straight. </p> <p>A Home Office white paper setting out a new strategy to tackle organised crime also proposed a new \"supergrass\" system. </p> <p>Criminals who \"turn Queen's Evidence\" could win immunity from prosecution, or have their sentence cut by more than two-thirds if they shop their gang bosses. </p> <p>Supergrasses could be eligible for a national witness protection programme, in a bid to avoid retribution from former accomplices. </p> <p>Sentences for drugs gangs could also be increased so that Class A drug smugglers face sentences of 20 years compared with the five to 14 years currently imposed, said the paper. </p> <p>Fewer than 1% of cases brought by Customs and Excise last year saw defendants turn Queen's Evidence under the existing case law system, compared with 26% in United States drug trafficking cases. </p> <p>Putting Queen's Evidence on a firm statutory basis could increase the figure substantially and help cut the \u00a340bn a year that organised crime costs Britain, officials believe. </p> <p>The white paper also proposed creating a new offence of \"belonging to an organised crime group\". </p>",
  "<p>The head of Britain's newest education quango today took a swipe at the \"overregulation\" of universities.</p> <p>Ruth Deech, head of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, which has been set up to deal with student grievances, said higher education quangos cost \u00a31bn a year - the amount which increased student tuition fees would bring in. </p> <p>Referring to bodies like the Quality Assurance Agency and the higher education funding councils, she told postgraduates at Coventry University: \"There is a lot of money to be saved in pruning these quangos.</p> <p>\"We live in an age of overregulation. I do think universities are overregulated and there are too many quangos,\" she said at the annual conference of the National Postgraduate Committee.</p> <p>As the new adjudicator Ms Deech, former principal of St Anne's college Oxford and head of the Human Fertilisation and Embryo Authority, will act as an ombudsman for student complaints in place of the archaic university Visitor system under which students at older universities could only appeal to the Queen or possibly the local bishop.</p> <p>Universities will be forced to become more formal, she admitted. \"I am sorry if our existence makes universities more formal but although they mean well by acting informally it may end up not being such a good idea,\" she said.</p> <p>One factor was the growth in the numbers of overseas students. \"We need and welcome a lot of overseas students - at the very least there should be an impartial, fair channel if they have a grievance, as there should for everyone.\" </p> <p>Ms Deech's office in Reading has received hundreds of inquiries and about 40 full complaints since March. Students may still go to court if dissatisfied with a decision but universities will be expected to comply - they are not legally bound to do so but Ms Deech warned they would be named and shamed if they did not. She may refer a matter back to the university or order compensation. </p> <p>Saying she had a particular sympathy for postgraduates - \"it can be a very difficult, lonely and expensive time\" - Ms Deech said her office was already getting complaints about rejected theses and inadequate supervision in this area. </p> <p>The OIA will not interfere with matters of academic judgement - Ms Deech recognised that this could be difficult to disentangle with regard to postgraduate complaints about, say, vivas. \"We are very concerned to maintain the integrity of academic judgement. A first is a first and we are not going to mess around with that.\"</p> <p>But she also said it would be sad if too much regulation produced blandness and stifled the \"exciting and eccentric variety of British higher education\". She warned postgraduates to expect the \"rough with the smooth\" at their advanced level of study.</p> <p>Early next year all universities will become legally bound to sign up to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator - apparently one or two of the older institutions were under the impression that it would be voluntary and they didn't need to bother. More than 100 universities and colleges are already signed up to the OIA. </p> <p>Universities have so far mostly failed to put links to the OIA on their own websites but Ms Deech believes attitudes are changing. \"Even knowing a student is writing to us has encouraged university and students to get together to sort things out. </p> <p>\"What we all want is to have things settled early and cheaply and speedily. Time matters to a student. Six months may be a short time to a university but to a student it can be absolutely crucial - they are waiting to move on, to apply for a job or a visa.\"</p> <p>She said decisions would be made within three or four months, certainly within six months.</p>",
  "<p>Pop tribute bands leave me cold: sitting in some National Trust garden or sweaty club listening to bewigged, counterfeit versions of Oasis or Abba is my idea of purgatory - if not quite as awful as having to watch the real thing. Classical soundalike bands don't seem to exist - the very idea of the \"Shamadeus Quartet\", \"Phony Kronos\" or \"a tribute to Thomas Beecham\" (complete with off-colour jokes) seems ridiculous. </p> <p>But jazz musicians can almost get away with it. The Belgian band Travelling Joni Mitchell did a good job of covering those spine-chilling songs from Heijera, Mingus and Don Juan's Reckless Daughter. The vocals were OK, but the real star was fretless bassist Michel Hatzigeorgiou, who played every ripe note with relish. Nearly Dan don't attempt to reproduce the tonsorial, sartorial or vocal styles of their heroes (Steely Dan), but play the arrangements pretty well note for note, with an enthusiastic relish for Becker and Fagen's melodic and harmonic sophistication. (Though their drummer has to deal with fans helpfully pointing out that he didn't play the famous \"Steve Gadd mistake\" in Aja.) </p> <p>Tribute bands don't come much heavier than Henry Kaiser and Wadada Leo Smith's Yo Miles! Their album <strong> Sky Garden</strong> (Cuneiform, \u00a318.99), a double album with a big, hard-hitting line-up, includes some of the most enduring pieces - It's About the Time, Great Expectations, Directions - from the electric Miles Davis bands of 1969-75. The 10-piece band includes saxophonists John Tchicai and Greg Osby (featured at this weekend's Brecon Jazz Festival) and keyboard player Tom Coster; guest players include tabla player Zakir Hussain and the Rova Saxophone Quartet. Leo Smith, whose trumpet-playing is consistently good and idiomatic without copying Miles, contributes several new tunes. And they largely succeed in making this curiously misunderstood form of improvised music work for a new era. At times Steve Smith's drumming is a bit too \"miscellaneous\" (to employ Joe Zawinul's useful put-down) for its own good: you long for the cool pulse or raucous clatter that Davis's best drummers generated. Nevertheless, Kaiser, Smith and co make a good noise that is beautifully recorded (and also available in Super Audio CD format). </p> <p>Yulduz's <strong> Bilmadim </strong> (30 Hertz, \u00a313.99) is an album of songs by Yulduz Usmanova and Jah Wobble. It has a pop feel, featuring the deep, repetitive bass that has become Wobble's principal trademark. We also get spunky rhythm guitar courtesy of jazz-reggae veteran Ernest Ranglin. Usmanova, originally from Usbekistan, yodels appealingly and the album noodles along nicely with a trancey, dubby atmosphere. </p> <p>Connoisseurs of the novelty immigration songs (cf Goodness Gracious Me, or Walter Becker's Hat Too Flat) will be anxious to add Yulduz's Kiss Me to their collections: \"Kiss me, kiss me, squeeze me tight/I don't speak English but I know my rights.\" There are two bonus remixes (by Bill Laswell and Philippe Verge) of this convincingly poptastic song, which also features a sparky accordion part by Clive Bell. Though Wobble's unfeasibly low bass is prominent throughout, this is definitely a pop album, with tunes that wouldn't be out of place at the Eurovision Song Contest. Not the British entry, I hasten to add. </p> <p><strong> Tango Crash</strong> (Galileo, \u00a313.99) looks at first glance like another album put out in the wake of the Gotan Project's success, such as the patchy Piazzolla Remixed, or the Bajafondo Tango Club. But there's much more to it, partly because it is so musical, with a highly original approach to rhythm (the percussionist and co-producer is the talented Marcio Doctor). The prime movers are two Berlin-based musician/ programmers: cellist Martin Iannaccone and pianist Daniel Almada, who also contribute most of the material. The atmosphere they generate is dark and occasionally unsettling. Two bandoneon players provide the broken heart of tango myth; Rodrigo Dominguez's soprano sax implies a more positive outcome; Iannaccone's pleading cello is elegant and erotic. It's an album with many layers. </p> <p><strong>Buy these CDs at Amazon.co.uk</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022FWG8\">Yo Miles, Sky Garden</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002H24LO\">Yulduz, Bilmadim</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DC162\">Tango Crash, Tango Crash</a></p>",
  "<p>A film which portrays Mexico City as a lawless hive of kidnappers opens there today to a surprisingly warm reception. About 2,500 people turned up for a glitzy premiere earlier in the week for Man on Fire, which one American critic described as a \"distasteful piece of ultra-violent exploitation\". Variety says the film is being carefully marketed at Mexicans, and has been eating up newsprint in recent weeks. The director, Tony Scott, said he \"hopes the film can call attention to kidnapping and puts the people on their feet rather than remaining quietly seated.\" Man on Fire stars Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning. It opens here on October 8.</p> <p> <strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> has signed to play jazz singer Peggy Lee in the upcoming Truman Capote biopic Every Word is True. Sigourney Weaver has also joined the cast, which already features Hollywood talent Mark Wahlberg and Sandra Bullock. The project - which Variety says is budgeted at a very low $10m - will focus on the relationship between Capote and two death row convicts whom he interviewed for his seminal true crime book In Cold Blood.</p>",
  "On a balmy spring evening in Lisbon Tony Blair set in motion the events that led to yesterday's appointment of Peter Mandelson as one of the EU's senior political figures. <p>Over dinner in the ornate splendour of the Pestana Palace Hotel he told Jose Manuel Barroso that he would be delighted to see him become president of the European commission.</p> <p>As he flew off in the early hours of the following morning for his historic \"tent\" summit with Colonel Muammar Gadafy, the prime minister had no idea that his closest political ally would land one of the most significant EU jobs five months later.</p> <p>But the warmth of his encounter with Mr Barroso put Britain at an advantage when commission jobs were being handed out.</p> <p>\"It is one of the most important posts in the new commission,\" Denis MacShane, the Europe minister said. \"The anti-Europeans in London do not understand the extent to which Britain is seen as a major European nation again after the years of Tory isolationism.\"</p> <p>The former trade commissioner Lord Brittan who, like Mr Mandelson, served as trade and industry secretary before moving to Brussels, said: \"Frankly it is more important than most cabinet jobs. You are negotiating on behalf of the EU with the USA, Japan, China and the WTO.\"</p> <p>Such a prominent post, involving a lot of travel, will force Mr Mandelson to make a decisive break with British politics, at least for the next five years.</p> <p>In the run-up to next year's general election, when Mr Blair would be expected to turn to his old friend for candid political advice, Mr Mandelson will be immersed in trade negotiations.</p> <p> Most Labour MPs, who have despaired at the continuing influence of Mr Mandelson, will be delighted to see the back of such a prickly figure.</p> <p>But Mr Mandelson is delighted to have secured the trade portfolio - with international competitiveness thrown in for good measure - which will force him to forge a political identity in his own right.</p> <p>In his three ministerial posts in Labour's first term, Mr Mandelson was seen as Tony Blair's enforcer.</p> <p>Hearing his soft, and at times slightly menacing, voice on the phone signalled to ministers that a prime ministerial decree was being issued.</p> <p>In Brussels and the world capitals where he will negotiate Europe's trade deals Mr Mandelson's closeness to Mr Blair will still count.</p> <p>But it will not be enough on its own, and he will need to establish new alliances.</p> <p>Neil Kinnock, one of Britain's outgoing commissioners, who hired Mr Mandelson as Labour communications director in the 1980s, is understood to fear that he will have difficulty fitting in with the commission's consensual style.</p> <p>But one friend said Mr Mandelson was well placed for networking in Europe and beyond. \"Peter's Policy Network outfit has kept him in touch with senior European figures and the Clinton people,\" an ally said.</p> <p>\"He has walk-in rights all over the US, in a way that some of the other Europeans haven't. He is seen as a very, very serious figure.\"</p> <p>While his Labour enemies will happily wave farewell to Mr Mandelson when he takes the Eurostar to Brussels, they may find that his influence on British politics remains as strong as ever.</p> <p>As a member of Mr Barroso's inner team pushing through economic reforms - the \"Lisbon agenda\"- he will play a decisive role in trying to meet Gordon Brown's \"sixth test\" for British membership of the euro.</p> <p>The chancellor has said Britain cannot contemplate joining until Europe reforms its hidebound economies.</p> <p>\"If I were prime minister I would be very pleased with this appointment,\" Lord Brittan said waspishly.</p> <p><b>The stars of the show</b></p> <p><b> ****</b><br> <b>Jose Manuel Barroso (president)</b> <br>Ex-Maoist, centre-right former Portuguese prime minister</p> <p><b>***</b> <br><b>Peter Mandelson (trade)</b><br> Key Blair ally, will have role in pushing economic reform</p> <p><b> Neelie Kroes-Smit (competition)</b><br> Dutch transport expert who will have to drop directorships</p> <p><b> Charlie McCreevy (internal market)</b><br> Domestically unpopular former Irish finance minister</p> <p><b>G\u00fcnter Verheugen (vice-president, enterprise and industry)</b><br> Close ally of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der</p> <p><b> Joaqu\u00edn Almunia (economic and monetary affairs)</b><br>Spanish socialist</p> <p><b>**</b><br> <b>Jacques Barrot (vice-president, transport) </b><br> French centre-right minister, will have to pacify unions</p> <p><b> Margot Wallstr\u00f6m (vice-president, institutional relations and communication)</b><br> Tipped as future Swedish PM</p> <p><b>Danuta Huebner (regional policy)</b><br> Polish free-market economist</p> <p><b> Siim Kallas (vice-president, audit and anti-fraud)</b><br> Ex Estonia prime minister, popular with Blair<br></p> <p><b>Joe Borg (fisheries and maritime affairs)</b><br> Malta's former foreign affairs minister</p> <p><b>Dalia Grybauskaite (financial programming and budget)</b><br> Former minister of finance</p> <p><b>Louis Michel (development) </b><br> Former Belgian foreign minister, annoyed US over Iraq</p> <p><b>Ollie Rehn (enlargement) </b><br> Finnish superbrain, youngest commissioner</p> <p><b>Mariann Fischer Boel (agriculture)</b><br> Danish farm minister, family of landowners<br><br> <b>Benita Ferrero-Waldner (external relations)</b><br> Aristocratic Austrian</p> <p><b>Vladimir Spidla (employment and social affairs)</b><br> Former Czech prime minister, with limited English </p> <p><b>Ingrida Udre (taxation and customs union) </b><br> Former speaker of Latvia's parliament and fan of the game of basketball</p> <p><b> Rocco Buttiglione (vice-president, justice, freedom and security)</b><br> Will deal with asylum issues</p> <p><b>*</b></p> <p><b>Vivian Reding (information society and media)</b><br> Bouffanted Luxembourger, Cannes film festival-goer </p> <p><b>Stavros Dimas (environment) </b><br> Greek free market economist</p> <p><b> Janez Potocnik (science and research) </b><br> Former Slovenian Europe minister</p> <p><b>Jan Figel (education, training and culture)</b><br> Former Slovakian chief negotiator of entry to the EU</p> <p><b> Markos Kyprinaou (health and consumer protection)</b><br> Cypriot lawyer and ex-finance minister</p> <p><b> Laszlo Kovasc (energy)</b><br> 65-year-old former Hungarian foreign minister </p> <p><b>* Stars denote relative importance</b></p>",
  "<p>The developers of the first new test for tuberculosis in 110 years yesterday predicted that it would help to reduce cases in Britain by thousands within 10 to 15 years. </p> <p>They also claimed that the blood test would enable health chiefs around the world to target a disease which affects 9 million people - and kills 2 million - each year. </p> <p>Oxford Immunotec, the company behind the \u00a320 test, said it would take TB \"out of the Victorian era\", although the government said further work was needed before its role in routine diagnosis could be confirmed. </p> <p>Rates of TB in Britain have soared since the 1980s, with about 7,500 cases being diagnosed annually. The traditional skin test for the disease involves injecting tuberculin into the skin and waiting days for health professionals to assess the reaction. </p> <p>But it can give false results, meaning cases are missed or needlessly treated with drugs. The new test, which can deliver results overnight, has taken 10 years to develop and has been used in trials with 4,000 people in 11 countries. </p> <p>Infection provokes a response by immune cells in the blood, known as T cells, and the test has been named T SPOT-TB. It was invented by Ajit Lalvani, Wellcome senior research fellow and a consultant physician at Oxford University's Nuffield department of clinical medicine. </p> <p>He said: \"In contrast to the crude and inaccurate skin test, the new blood tests are fast, accurate and convenient ... I believe it will significantly improve the way we manage tuberculosis.\" </p> <p>Dr Lalvani thought rates in Britain could be reduced within a decade. TB was rife until the 1950s and can usually be successfully treated with a long course of antibiotics. But some strains have developed a resistance to drugs and it is often not detected early enough. </p> <p>The disease can remain latent for nearly a lifetime, until the victim's immune system fails, meaning many older people in Britain are susceptible, as well as asylum seekers arriving from heavily infected parts of the world and people on chemotherapy or with HIV. In others, the active disease will develop almost immediately after infection, either in the lungs or in the blood, lymph glands, spine or organs. </p> <p>Peter Davies, director of the tuberculosis research and resources unit in Liverpool, thought the test might be available within a few months. </p> <p>Paul Sommerfield, chair of the charity TB Alert, said the importance of access to accurate and reliable diagnosis \"cannot be overstated\".</p>",
  "The 2001 Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act states that a non-national can be detained indefinitely if the secretary of state suspects that person of being a terrorist and he or she is believed to be a risk to national security. <p>Article 15 of the 1984 United Nations convention against torture says that states \"shall ensure that any statement ... made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made\". </p> <p>How do these two precepts of law combine? </p> <p>The question is not purely academic. A number of people have been held in British prisons, and one in a high-security psychiatric hospital, since the 2001 act was passed. They do not know most of the evidence against them because it is kept secret in the interests of national security. Ten of the men have appealed against their detention, arguing that the evidence against them may have been extracted from prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo Bay under torture. On Wednesday, the court of appeal rejected their appeals. </p> <p>In doing so, the court legitimated the use of information acquired as a result of torture - so long as it was committed by non-UK officials abroad in proceedings connected with detention under the 2001 act. This is certain to put Britain on a collision course with the international human rights community, as well as doing nothing to redeem the reputation of a country already tarnished by the brush of Guant\u00e1namo and Abu Ghraib. The case is almost certain to go to the House of Lords. </p> <p>The prohibition of torture as a matter of international law is well established. But what are the consequences of this? The court of appeal chooses to draw heavily on the classic notion of \"dualism\" in order to keep the potential effect of the UN convention at arm's length, stressing that international treaty obligations do not have any direct effect but must be transformed into domestic law first, such as through legislation. </p> <p>This is quite true, but it is also true that those parts of international law which are considered to be principles of \"customary international law\" can have an immediate impact. The court declined to hear arguments on whether the prohibition on the use of information acquired through torture had acquired this status and it is likely that this issue will figure more prominently in future proceedings. </p> <p>Be that as it may, there were plenty of routes through which the court might have been able to conclude that the use of such evidence was impermissible. Indeed, Lord Justice Neuberger, one of the appeal court judges, did reach such a conclusion, believing that it would be incompatible with the right to a fair trial provided for in article six of the European convention of human rights and which by virtue of the 1998 Human Rights Act is certainly within the realm of domestic law. </p> <p>However, Lord Justice Laws, another of the judges, disagreed that there was any such incompatibility. He did consider whether it was an \"abuse of process\" to draw on information acquired through torture. He decided that it was not. Basing himself upon the moral high ground provided by the constitutional principle of the rule of law, he accepted that this \"rules out reliance by the secretary of state, before the special immigration appeal commission or any other tribunal in this jurisdiction, upon any statement obtained by torture which the state has procured or connived at\". However, he was \"quite unable to see that any such principle prohibits the secretary of state from relying ... on evidence coming into his hands which has _ been obtained through torture by agencies of other states ... If he has neither procured the torture nor connived at it, he has not offended the constitutional principle\". One suspects - and hopes - that the House of Lords will not be so myopic. </p> <p>The problem is simple. Torture is impermissible under international law, and any state official - of any country, and anywhere - who commits such an act is committing a criminal offence and is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of other countries as well as those of the country in which the act occurred. Can it really be the case that the exigencies of the \"war against terror\" mean that the rule of law is well served by allowing any such material that happens to come the secretary of state's way to be used in this fashion? Is it not bizarre to take the view that use of information resulting from torture committed by a British public servant violates the rule of law, whereas the use of information received under torture by public servants of another state does not? It certainly violates the rule of international law. If it matters that the material is the product of torture, the nationality or employer of the torturer is irrelevant. Does the nationality of the torture victim matter, too? </p> <p>It is quite true that there was a certain lack of clarity regarding the scope of the international norm prohibiting the use of evidence obtained through torture. This judgment has magnified those uncertainties. It signalled a \"blind eye\" approach to its use and flies in the face of the many developments that have served to clamp down on the use of torture even in times of national emergency. </p> <p>The best that can be said is that the scope of the judgment is limited. But the signals it sends are depressing and it is to be hoped that this decision will not stand long. Torture is torture, and it really does not matter who does it or where it is done. If the courts do not believe that it is an abuse of process to use evidence acquired by such means, then one might hope that the government would solve the problem by incorporating article 15 of the UN convention into our law as a matter of urgency. But that seems rather unlikely in the near future. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Malcolm Evans is professor of public international law, at the University of Bristol and co-author of Combating Torture in Europe </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.d.evans@bristol.ac.uk\">m.d.evans@bristol.ac.uk</a></p>"
