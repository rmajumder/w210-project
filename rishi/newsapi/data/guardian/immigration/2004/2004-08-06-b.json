  "<p>Quite a few people fantasise about mosaic tiling; that idea they had to inlay a lemon tree in the hall floor or recreate a design seen in Mexico. But do they ever get round to it? Of course not. The intention is there, but coordinating the purchase of tiles, glue and grout, while remembering to get the yogurt from Tesco, is too much. </p> <p>Visit a mosaic specialist (Mosaic Workshop in London, Fired Earth stores nationwide, or Scotland's Wild Tiles) and all this will change. At Mosaic Workshop, jars full of hot pink, tangerine and aqua glass make the place look like an old-fashioned sweet shop, and the works-in-progress lying around (some panels for Westminster Cathedral when I visited) are equally enticing. You'll leave with pocketfuls of glass, gold leaf and Mexican ceramics. </p> <p>Mosaic tiling is, however, messy and time-consuming, so it's a good idea to block off a weekend for a project the size of this table. A weekend is quite a commitment in this day and age, but unlike a night on the tiles, two days with tiles is rewarding, shame-free and fun - especially if you do it with friends. </p> <p><strong>You will need</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Tiles</strong><br>You can smash plates or buy tesserae (lingo for the little tiles) online, but mosaic virgins should head for Mosaic Workshop, 020-7263 2997 (<a href=\"http://www.mosaicworkshop.com\">mosaicworkshop.com</a>) or a branch of Fired Earth, 01295 812088 (<a href=\"http://www.firedearth.co.uk\">firedearth.co.uk</a>) to get a feel for different materials. </p> <p><strong>Rubber gloves</strong><br>Heavy-duty tile nippers (Homebase, \u00a311.99) Don't bother with \"nibblers\": the difference is like using plastic scissors instead of metal. </p> <p><strong>Goggles</strong><br>Tile grout (Granfix, from Mosaic Workshop, \u00a33 per 1.5kg bag) </p> <p><strong>Cement-based tile adhesive</strong><br>(Arduflex 5000, from Mosaic Workshop, \u00a33 per 1kg bag) </p> <p><strong>Notched adhesive spreader</strong><br>(\u00a31.89, Homebase) </p> <p><strong>Brown paper</strong> </p> <p><strong>Paintbrushes</strong> </p> <p><strong>Water-soluble PVA</strong><br>This will stick the tiles to your design, then peel off. </p> <p><strong>Dust mask</strong> </p> <p><strong>Method</strong><br> </p> <p>There are two approaches to mosaic making: direct (sticking the tile directly on to a surface) and indirect (sticking the tiles face down on paper first, then flipping on to an adhesive-coated surface). I'm showing the latter; it's better for intricate patterns and you'll end up with a truly flat surface - ideal for a drinks table. </p> <p><strong>1</strong> Cut a piece of brown paper to fit your surface and draw a pattern on the less shiny side. </p> <p><strong>2</strong> Plan the colours and pick the tiles; you can use glass, ceramic or mirror. Look at websites for ideas (<a href=\"http://www.mosaicworkshop.com\">mosaicworkshop.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wildtiles.co.uk\">wildtiles.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thejoyofshards.co.uk\">thejoyofshards.co.uk</a>). And go into a shop to handle tiles first. </p> <p><strong>3</strong> Mix PVA in a jar with an equal quantity of water - be careful not to use more glue than water, or the brown paper will never peel off your tiles. </p> <p><strong>4</strong> Using a paintbrush, dab a little of this mix on the posh side of the tiles and stick one row, face down, around the outer edge of your design. Remember, you're going to flip the whole thing over, so at this stage the backs should be uppermost. A 1-2mm gap between each tile looks good. Avoid going any closer as this makes grouting more tricky. </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Wearing goggles, cut tiles to fill patterned areas, then do the background last. To cut tiles, place the edge of the tile in the jaw of the nippers and gently squeeze the handles. You can angle nippers to cut diagonal lines or other shapes. </p> <p><strong>6</strong> Nail a thin copper lip around the perimeter of your table surface - buy it from a mosaic specialist and ask for a finishing clip to hide the join of the two ends. </p> <p><strong>7</strong> Wearing rubber gloves, mix the cement-based adhesive according to its instructions. Spread it on your surface with a notched spreader, ensuring uniform thickness. NB: Work through the next three steps quickly because the adhesive remains workable for only 40 minutes. </p> <p><strong>8</strong> Mix the grout to a smooth, thick consistency and rub between the tiles (yes, they're still on the brown paper) using hands or a grout spreader. Doing the grouting at this stage prevents your table adhesive coming through between the tiles when you press them in. </p> <p><strong>9</strong> Use a damp sponge to wipe away excess grout, cleaning the sponge between wipes so you're not just moving grout around. </p> <p><strong>10</strong> Get a friend to help gently lift your grouted mosaic and place it paper side up on to the adhesive, pressing firmly into place. </p> <p><strong>11</strong> Dampen the paper with a wet sponge and wait 15-20 minutes for the glue to dissolve before peeling it off. If it doesn't peel easily, dampen again and wait a bit longer. </p> <p><strong>12</strong> Wipe the surface clean with a damp sponge. </p> <p><strong>13</strong> When dry, re-grout to fill any gaps. </p> <p>Now it's time to book in for a manicure.</p>",
  "<p>Every time I offer a plate of this week's star ingredient to foreigners, they devour it in minutes. In fact, it is the most popular dish among westerners who come to my dinner parties. And, believe it or not, the ingredient in question is raw lamb.</p> <p>In Lebanon, lamb takes centre stage at weddings, Easter feasts and any other big gatherings; the raw variety is especially highly prized. Similarly, any Lebanese table groaning under an assortment of mezza (a selection of small dishes) isn't complete without some kind of raw meat.</p> <p>When I went to study in New York, I fell in love with American steakhouses and would always choose to go to one whenever a visiting relative offered to take me out for dinner. But then something odd happened - during one of those meals out, my usual order of rare steak repulsed me. I couldn't finish it. After that, I refused to touch meat of any kind and began to think of myself as a vegetarian. But that illusion was shattered on my next trip home to Lebanon - faced with an enormous plate of kibbeh nayeh, I felt a sudden urge to consume it.</p> <p>My time as a vegetarian may have been over but, even so, for the next eight years I would eat meat only when I was back in Lebanon, and then only raw. These days, it is really only in the remotest villages in the north and south of the country that you find these raw meat dishes prepared in the traditional manner. For kibbeh nayeh, say, lamb leg is de-veined and pounded for hours in a stone urn to produce a smooth pur\u00e9e. It is then mixed with cracked wheat, onion, salt and pepper, and served immediately.</p> <p>For fteeleh nayeh, lean fillet of lamb is cut into small cubes and served on a platter, alongside two small plates, one filled with salt, the other with pepper. Diners scoop up the meat in a small piece of pita bread, then dip it into the salt and pepper. The principle is that the seasoning masks the raw taste of the meat. Lamb's liver, or kasbeh nayeh, is consumed in much the same way, though it is sometimes also accompanied by small cubes of fat.</p> <p>Whichever of these dishes you try, though, serve it with the traditional accompaniment, namely Lebanon's favourite alcoholic drink, Arak (it's a bit like a cross between pastis and ouzo), served with ice and water.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><strong>Kibbeh nayeh</strong></p> <p> 6 fresh mint leaves<br> 2 chilli peppers (or hot chilli powder)<br> 1 onion, cut into eighths<br> 400g cooked burghul (cracked wheat)<br> 1kg leg of lamb, boned<br> 1 pinch each white pepper, black pepper and salt</p> <p>In an electric mixer, whizz together the mint, chilli and onion, then slowly add a quarter of the cooked burghul. De-vein the lamb. If using an electric mixer, cut the meat into small cubes before processing; alternatively, pass it through a fine mincer (traditionally, it would be pounded in a mortar until pur\u00e9ed, but this takes a long time, so only try it if you're a real stickler for authenticity). Slowly add the onion, mint and burghul mix to the meat, then transfer everything to a bowl.</p> <p>Add three or four ice cubes to the bowl to keep the meat cold, then quickly knead the mixture by hand, adding the rest of the burghul as you do so. Next, add salt and pepper to taste. Serve at once with a few stalks of fresh mint and some green or white onions cut into wedges. Spread the kibbeh over your individual plate, drizzle with olive oil and scoop it up with pita bread.</p> <p><strong>Mouhamasah</strong></p> <p>A traditional accompaniment to kibbeh nayeh.</p> <p>1 onion, chopped fine<br> 2 tbsp butter<br> 400g leg of lamb, boned and finely ground<br> 100g pine nuts<br> 1 tbsp pomegranate syrup<br> Salt and pepper</p> <p>Saut\u00e9 the onion in the butter, then add the pine nuts and ground meat, and cook until browned. Add salt and pepper to taste, stir in the pomegranate syrup, diluted in a little water, and cover for 20 minutes. Serve hot.</p> <p><strong>Fteeleh nayeh</strong></p> <p>Heaven on a plate.</p> <p>600g fillet of lamb<br> Salt and pepper<br> Pita bread</p> <p>Cut meat into very small cubes. Unlike the previous dishes, do not sprinkle the seasonings on the meat, rather serve them alongside in separate dishes. Scoop up the meat with a piece of pita, dip it heavily into the salt and pepper, and eat with relish.</p> <p><strong>Kasbeh nayeh</strong></p> <p>600g lambs' liver (as fresh as possible)<br> Salt and pepper<br> Pita bread</p> <p>De-vein the liver, then cut it into small cubes. Traditionally, the liver is prepared on a bed of pita bread, which absorbs the excess juices (throw it away afterwards, or give it to the dog). Again, do not season before serving. Serve at once with the seasoning in separate dishes.</p>",
  "<p>Predictions of Big Brother's demise seem, rather like some of the characters in the latest series, to have been greatly exaggerated. </p> <p>After a critically panned fourth series and a rash of pale imitations, the casting of a brassy Portuguese transsexual, a Somalian former asylum seeker and a pretty-boy English rich kid has saved the show from a slow death. </p> <p>As the winner was paraded in front of a baying crowd last night, the show's producers were congratulating themselves for reviving the once-trailblazing programme, which seemed to be heading for the television history books after the somnolent fourth series. </p> <p>While ratings have not matched the highs of the third series, featuring Jade Goody and won by Kate Lawler, they are up on the low point of last year to a peak of 7.7 million before last night. Crucially, there has been much more media comment, with opinions conveniently polarised between those who believe the show to be powerfully entertaining and others who lament it as unedifyingly crass. </p> <p>While revenue from voting is down, possibly attributable to a form of voter fatigue that would be familiar to the political class, there are still plenty of financial winners: not least the showbusiness agent John Noel, who has signed up many of the contes tants to big-money tabloid deals. </p> <p>The show has undeniably given the critics plenty to get their teeth into: sex, lewd behaviour and a stand-up fight after a confrontation engineered by the producers - a situation that caused mid-series jitters at Channel 4, before order was restored. </p> <p>Big Brother naysayers have included the Labour grandee Roy Hattersley and the former Panorama reporter Tom Mangold, both of whom weighed in against the series in strong terms this week. </p> <p>Mangold, writing in the Evening Standard in London, said: \"BB has morphed into Channel 4's Frankenstein - a commercially successful juggernaut which has to become more and more outrageous in order to sustain its viewing figures. What began as a harmless little social experiment has become a monster out of control.\" </p> <p>Hattersley broadened the argument into a lament for British television in general in yesterday's Daily Mail: \"The broadcasters only have themselves to blame. They have fed the viewing public the cheap diet for so long that a new generation of viewers have come to believe that television should have nothing to do with mental activity.\" </p> <p>Peter Bazalgette, the chairman of Endemol, the production company that makes Big Brother, was scornful of the pair yesterday. </p> <p>\"It's no coincidence that most of the critics of Big Brother are old men. Older people cannot stomach younger people's lack of problem with nudity, sex and so-called bad language, and the reactions to Big Brother are obvious manifestations of that.\" </p> <p>He said the latest series had confounded and confused the critics: \"It's been enormous fun, there's been a huge amount of laughter. </p> <p>\"Think about the moments - Ahmed, the devout Muslim, apparently struggling to handle the authority of a woman, demanding that sergeant Michelle give him her jacket. And Nadia, who must have had the most unusual motive ever for taking part in Big Brother - she didn't mind that the rest of the country knew that she was a transsexual, she wanted to see if she could be accepted by an enclosed group of people on her own terms.\" </p> <p>Boyd Hilton, the TV editor of Heat magazine, said the series had overcome the problems of last year. </p> <p>\"When it started people were sounding the death knell for reality TV in general and BB in particular, saying that it had become tired and predictable and that it would die a death. The housemates have been fascinating - they started out looking like a bunch of freaks but we've got to know them as multi-faceted, real human beings. </p> <p>\"The real challenge now for Channel 4 and Endemol is keeping the show this exciting year in year out, but I think the most imaginative and clever producers in TV are working on these shows and am fully confident we'll be watching the 10th anniversary Big Brother in five years' time.\" </p> <p><strong>The highlights</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebellion</strong><br> </p> <p>Lesbian anarchist Kitten tried to be the most controversial character, but was kicked out on Day 8 for breaking the rules 34 times. Producers gave her three official warnings after she painted slogans on walls and climbed on to the roof. </p> <p><strong>Secret bedsit</strong><br> </p> <p>Big Brother fuelled tension by \"evicting\" two of the contestants - Michelle and Emma - and confining them to a bedsit, where they could eavesdrop on everything the other housemates were saying about them. </p> <p><strong>Fight night</strong><br> </p> <p>The notorious alcohol-fuelled riot on Day 20 after Emma and Michelle reappeared in the house. Security guards had to separate the warring housemates after they threatened to kill each other. Live TV coverage had to be cut for an hour -the first time in the show's history that this had happened. Emma left the house as a result of the row. </p> <p><strong>Ahmania</strong><br> </p> <p>Ahmed, a 44-year-old former asylum seeker, was the most complex character. Prone to unpredictable behaviour and angry outbursts - smashing plates on the floor and beheading Maureen, the giant papier-mch\u00e9 statue built by the housemates. Big Brother's boot-camp task disturbed him because it reminded him of living under a dictatorship in Somalia. </p> <p><strong>Revenge</strong><br> </p> <p>Stuart's treasured cowboy hat was burned in response to the housemate staging a 10-hour silent sit-in in retaliation for being denied extra food rations after they failed their weekly task. After Stuart was given a tiny replacement hat Michelle stole the Diary Room camera, buried it in straw and threatened to set it alight. </p> <p><strong>Victor: lyrical poet</strong><br> </p> <p>\"I'm Slick V-I-C, da ghetto VIP. Mess around wid me I leave you RIP. Shizzle my nizzle, you get me? </p> <p>\"Erm, one more thing, can we have two loaves of bread, one white, one brown, and some milk, please Big Brother?\" </p> <p><strong>Naked ambition</strong><br> </p> <p>Shell ran naked around the garden mowing the lawn and stripped to a pinny while preparing a BBQ. Other episodes of nakedness included a mud-wrestling competition and Jason letting Daniel lick chocolate spread from his bare bottom. </p> <p><strong>Stu and Michelle</strong><br> </p> <p>Michelle created a makeshift love nest under a table to prepare her seduction of Stuart. He was at first reluctant to join her, but after lots of persuasion they became the first couple to have sex in the Big Brother house. </p> <p><strong>Wedding bust up</strong><br> </p> <p>The public turned on Victor after his furious row with Shell, when their mock wedding left her in floods of tears and threatening to quit the show. </p> <p>He told her in his speech: \"I asked you to marry me, even though there were rumours you've been around the block more times than a tramp's dog.\" </p> <p>He later called her a \"coward\" and a \"fake\", adding: \"She's a freeloader, She's ghosting through to week 10 by kissing arse.\" </p> <p><strong>Bunny boiler</strong><br> </p> <p>Michelle earned the tag \"bunny boiler\" within days of the couple getting together. She made Stuart pose for pretend wedding pictures, banned him from going on holiday without her, and threatened to beat up his Team Handsome mates if they give his number to another girl.</p>",
  "<p>Isabella Lickbarrow: the name sounds made up and slightly comic, like a character in a sitcom. Or so I thought, when I first came across her poetry just over a decade ago. At that time, the best of her books, Poetical Effusions, had been out of print since its first appearance in 1814, available only to those with a reader's ticket to a copyright library: 180 years of total neglect had done to her what they would to any writer, irrespective of the quality of their work.</p> <p>Last month, the enterprising Wordsworth Trust published the first collected edition of Lickbarrow's poems, compiled and introduced by Constance Parrish. It enables us to read her, for the first time since 1814, on her own terms, revealing that, even if she does not loom over the Romantic period like her near-contemporary and near-neighbour, the gizzard of Grasmere, her voice is every bit as passionate and original as his.</p> <p>Born in Kendal in November 1784, Lickbarrow was the eldest of four daughters of a Quaker schoolteacher, James Lickbarrow. Not unusually for the time, her mother died young, at 34; Isabella was only five-and-a-half. Elderly relatives helped raise her, including great-aunt Deborah Dalton, mother of scientist John Dalton (discoverer of the atom). Though not wealthy, her father could at least ensure that his daughters had a good education, teaching them Latin, Greek and French.</p> <p>She lost her father when she was just 20. The family had never been well off, and from that point on her life became one of constant labour, as she struggled to provide for herself and two younger sisters. It's easy to forget how difficult it once was for women to find work; it meant that for much of their lives the Lickbarrow sisters were one step from destitution.</p> <p>Driven by her talent from an early age, Isabella started writing poems in secret, but by 1811 felt there was no choice but to publish, as it would provide a desperately needed source of income. She was encouraged by the editor of the local newspaper, the Westmoreland Advertiser, where a flurry of poems appeared from November 1811 onwards.</p> <p>By 1814 her contributions had become so popular that the paper published her first book, Poetical Effusions, funded by subscription. In the Preface she says that \"The benevolence of kind friends suggested the present publication, to the Authoress, who after domestic employments of the day had secretly indulged herself in 'wooing the Muse' at intervals from repose.\"</p> <p>What distinguishes her treatment of the Lake District landscape she knew and loved is a mystical sense of being drawn into its heart, as when in her poem on leaving Penrith she writes: \"Oh mountains, woods, and streams, but just beheld / With silent admiration, then forsook, / In your lone caves and wild romantic glens / Are the abode of some kind unseen Power - / That Power will I invoke when far remote / To visit me, and make these scenes arise / Bright as they shine in Nature's wondrous book...\"</p> <p>Or when, in \"The Naiad's Complaint\", she declares: \"Nor greater pleasure could Columbus feel / When first beyond the transatlantic deep / His wandering eye beheld another world, / Than I, when in my wanderings I have found / Some sweet sequestered spot unknown before.\"</p> <p>This may sound like Wordsworth, but when these poems were written, neither of the long poems for which he is best known, \"The Prelude\" and \"The Excursion\", was in print. Lickbarrow sees the Lake District landscape in verse as if for the first time, finding her own unique way of articulating its strangeness.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more evident than in \"On Underbarrow Scar\", about her encounter with the massive limestone ridge that towers over Kendal, revealing her ability to describe not just the vastness and great age of her native mountains, but her place in their midst: \"Describe this vast stupendous pile of rock, / As rugged as the confines of the world, / Whence the huge masses far beneath it hurled / Seem severed by a mighty earthquake's shock; [...] With what sincere delight / I wander here; / When from the cares and toils of life set free, / I hail the blest return of liberty; / And these loved scenes my wearied spirits cheer; / At ease reclined upon this airy brow, / The prospect stretching wide, pleased I survey / The stony slope, the hanging woods below, / The ridges of the heath, the winding way...\"</p> <p>When she spoke of the \"cares and toils of life\", Lickbarrow weighed her words carefully. Although Poetical Effusions helped sustain her and her sisters, the proceeds couldn't last for ever. In 1818 someone petitioned the biggest landowner in the Lake District, Lord Lowther, to give her 10 guineas (about \u00a3440 today). It is symptomatic of her principled character that she returned it immediately, declaring, in the only letter in her hand known to survive, that \"to accept would be acting disingenuously towards your Lordship, and fear that I either incur the imputation of ingratitude or inconsistency\".</p> <p>What did she mean? Quite simply that she could not accept the patronage of the Tory peer, and rejected everything he stood for. Earlier that year the contesting of the Westmoreland constituency by the Whig politician Henry Brougham had caused riots on the streets of Kendal as it had always been accepted that the county's elected representatives in the Commons were to be Lowther's appointees - in this case his sons Viscount Lowther and Colonel Henry Lowther.</p> <p>The 1818 election was a shameful episode not just in the history of British politics, but in the career of Lickbarrow's near-neighbour Wordsworth, the former republican, who by contrast had accepted Lowther's patronage and canvassed tirelessly on his behalf. Political integrity comes at a price, and in Lickbarrow's case that meant terrible poverty, which in 1820 led to the incarceration of her sisters in the Lancaster Asylum, where for the next 15 years they were treated for severe depression. For the rest of her life, Lickbarrow worked unremittingly to generate income, able to publish only when time allowed. The strain took its toll, and she died exhausted, racked by tuberculosis, at the age of 62.</p> <p>She lived her life in penury, but her legacy is priceless, and is now for the first time made available in Parrish's new paperback edition. Parrish has spent years tracing the poems Lickbarrow contributed to newspapers and magazines, and presents them alongside her two book-length collections. She reveals a poetic vision as subtle and intense as that of her better-known male contemporaries.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Are Universes Thicker Than Blackberries?, by Martin Gardner (WW Norton, \u00a39.99)</strong></p> <p>Well, are they? The American philosopher Charles Sanders Pierce believes they are: that there may even be an infinite number of universes. If the word of a philosopher cuts no ice with you, then consider that about half of the experts in the field of quantum mechanics favour the Many Worlds Interpretation - the hypothesis that \"at every instant when a quantum measurement is made that has more than one possible outcome... the universe splits into two or more universes, each corresponding to a possible future.\" As you'll have worked out by now, this more or less cancels the possibility of free will. We live inside \"a monstrous wave function which never collapses unless it is observed and collapsed by an intelligence outside the multiverse, namely God\".</p> <p>Or take the matter of positrons. These opposites of electrons, tricky to spot, may actually be electrons, fleetingly observed, travelling backwards in time. Not weird enough for you? Then try this: the reason all electrons have identical charge and mass is because there's only one electron in the universe, weaving an incredibly complex path back and forth through reversible time. Our perception is an intersection through its travels and creates the picture that we call \"now\".</p> <p>Aha, I hear you say, but that would mean positrons would have to be much more plentiful than they appear to be. And, in a universe where everything has already happened, and we're just waiting to get round to experiencing it, the notion of free will goes up the spout again.</p> <p>Gardner won't have it. He likes free will. And he has no time, reversible or not, for the MWI. \"As far as we can tell, universes are not as plentiful as even two blackberries... I can only marvel at the low state to which today's philosophy of science has fallen.\"</p> <p>Which is ever so slightly disingenuous of him, for a large part of his stock-in-trade consists of holding fantastic theories up to a light and debunking them. Not that all fantastic theories are equivalently nonsensical. The MWI or the hypothetical time-travelling electron may be fantastic, but they are also thought-provoking and mathematically possible. Other beliefs - that people can be cured of all manner of illness simply by having a healer's hand waved over them; that autism is caused by emotionally costive parenting - are downright pernicious.</p> <p>This is Gardner's 60-somethingth book. Like many of them, it is a collection of pieces written for, mostly, The Skeptical Inquirer, but there are also introductions, reviews and other occasional work. Having been writing on anything from Edgar Wallace to magic hexagrams for over half a century, he pretty much knows everything - or makes you feel as if he does. Yet there is nothing overbearing in his omniscience. This is not, nor does it pretend to be, a unified narrative; it's a hugely entertaining collection of bits and bobs. Gardner likes puzzles, oddities, enigmas, and finds enough in the world of rigorously falsifiable science to attract him without having to entertain the gamut of loopy pseudo-science.</p> <p>This includes, I should warn you, Freudians. Devotees of Bruno Bettelheim should stay away from chapters 22 and 23, unless they want to witness a devastating and quite ferocious hatchet job. The latter chapter, to give you an idea, is called \"The Brutality of Dr Bettelheim\". Hemingway fans will be discomfited, too, and \"hatchet job\" is Gardner's own happy choice of phrase for his evaluation of this drunken bully's life and career. As for distant healing, eyeless vision and other occult practices, these get well-deserved kickings, although you may wonder if the effort spent exposing such rubbish might not be better spent - examining, perhaps, why people feel such a need to be fooled.</p>",
  "<p>There was an enormously distasteful story in the press some time ago. A devout elderly Muslim woman had died, and her body, when removed from the morgue for burial, was found covered with slabs of bacon. I was shocked on two levels: that there are people living among us who would do such a thing; and that such people have access to places even those of us who are not religious invest with sacredness. What saddened me most was that her family would never be able to divorce their memories of her from that awful, indescribably insulting image. In trying to make a point, someone had entirely altered the course of their grief. </p> <p>\"Grief\" is a powerful little word. Like \"love\", it accepts everything. Like \"Europe\" or \"America\", it describes a place where anything might happen. In the land of \"grief\" people tear out their hair, stay in their beds, starve themselves, put their faith in saints and psychics, give up on love. All is forgiven, on the understanding that eventually they will return. </p> <p>That Muslim family were hijacked on their journey. Nothing so malicious has touched me, but I think of them often, for my own grief has been forced down an unexpected path. </p> <p>My little sister Lucy Grealy died in New York on December 18 2002, at the age of 39. She had accidentally taken an overdose of heroin. Her life had been hard, but she had also experienced more joy than many. As a child, she was diagnosed with a cancer in the bone of her jaw. Treating it was physically agonising and hugely disfiguring. As an adult, she wrote about her life, to enormous literary acclaim, in a book called Autobiography Of A Face. Even when she was alive, I found it difficult to read. Her descriptions of my father, who died in 1979, were unbearably true. Finding him on those pages, singing or talking to our dogs, was like dreaming. A phrase about looking out the window above the kitchen sink of our childhood home in Spring Valley, New York, was like chancing upon a yellowing photograph of a place I had once loved. When she wrote about my mother, I felt I was standing outside the door, listening to conversations I had already heard. </p> <p>There was also irritation, for much of the book was careless. It was the first time I had experienced reading about my family and parts of my own life, and I realised how easy it was for Lucy simply to select her vantage point. I learned, too, how easily readers would accept it as the only true vantage point. But I was happy for Lucy. The book's success was a first-class ticket to a world she loved, in which doing what she thought she wanted - writing - earned money. </p> <p>Well before the publication of Autobiography Of A Face, Lucy had become friends with another writer, Ann Patchett. Ann was hugely patient with Lucy, who could be infuriatingly disorganised and irresponsible. She was able, it seemed, to accept Lucy's constant need of approbation and affection, even when Lucy herself ignored, and even scorned, those needs in others. Ann was a good friend. Lucy's life became harder, with endless reconstructive surgeries, frustration at her inability to recreate the crystalline beauty of Autobiography, and a loneliness she attributed to being \"ugly\". Ann supported her throughout, with company, money, food and love. </p> <p>Ann was a far better \"sister\" to Lucy than I could ever have been, but we never met while Lucy was alive. I had moved to London while they were still at college together. There had always been thousands of miles between us, and she was simply one of the many friends Lucy made so easily. When a review copy of Ann's book, Taft, arrived by courier at my house in London, Lucy, staying with me, didn't bother to open it. I wasn't surprised by the way she tossed it dismissively on to a chair, for she rarely showed interest, at least to me, in other people's achievements. I felt sorry for Ann then, because I knew how much she had done for my sister. </p> <p>As Lucy's life became more and more confused, I called Ann in exasperation. I had no idea that heroin had become so huge in my sister's life. I knew she was unreachably sad. Oddly, while Lucy and I had spent hundreds of hours discussing the failings of our confused childhood, we skated quickly over the thin ice that might expose us to a truth - that Lucy's illness had affected us all. She often had great - and comforting - insight into my mother's lifelong depression, but the understanding between us was that my mother brought the worst of it upon herself. We made such a harsh judgment of our mother's desperation that Lucy might have felt - in front of me, at least - that she had forfeited the right to her own. Ann, unwittingly, colluded. \"Lucy's so much like her mother,\" I said over the phone. \"Don't tell her that,\" Ann replied. </p> <p>At the funeral in New York, Ann read a beautiful piece she had written. Afterwards, I was consoled by my new, transatlantic email friendship with Ann. Six weeks later, she wanted an article about Lucy to appear in the New Yorker but in the end settled on New York magazine instead. Ann emailed a document for my signature, a family permission to use Lucy's letters. I was surprised that it did not mention the New York magazine article, but referred to HarperCollins, her publisher. I wish now that I had sent it to Lucy's agent in New York. But I was grieving, and innocent of the implications. </p> <p>That was my mistake. </p> <p>At about the same time, my sister Sarah - Lucy's nonidentical twin - and I were trying to sort through Lucy's papers in Connecticut, where she had stayed towards the end of her life. A family painting had disappeared from her room, along with many other belongings, and Sarah and I were sad about this. Friends of hers, not including Ann, had already been there. Sarah and I sorted through our own feelings at the time, confused as they were, and tried to convince ourselves that friends Lucy had loved were just as \"entitled\" to have her things as we were. I still believe that, even now. Lucy had loved that painting, however, and I was disturbed that someone would feel more entitled to such a connection with her past. I believed my nephews should have had it. </p> <p>While I was staying with Sarah, HarperCollins wanted to reissue Autobiography Of A Face with an afterword by Ann. We had read the afterword, and it was beautiful, but Sarah had asked, \"Where are we in this story?\" We are everywhere, I told her, like the paper it is printed on, though no one knows this but us. HarperCollins seemed very keen to issue it quickly, and we agreed. We thought, how could we not? We were in no state of mind to imagine the implications. </p> <p>I noticed that the reading Ann gave at Lucy's funeral and the piece in New York magazine shared similar phrases. The magazine had used a photograph of Lucy on the cover, and for a week Sarah, working in Manhattan, had to walk past a huge wall of these covers by the newsagent in the lobby of her building. She rushed past each day not looking, forcing herself to believe that having her dead twin's face staring out at her was a good thing, because people had loved her. I felt so sorry for Sarah then. </p> <p>Then Ann began to write what was to become Truth &amp; Beauty, about her friendship with my sister. At first I believed that this was as it should be. Ann is an artist, how else could she express her grief? This was the defence I used to friends in New York. They had been surprised by some of the personal detail in the New York magazine article; they asked, \"But why is she doing this?\" </p> <p>Later, Ann was in England for the Oxford Literary Festival. I heard a Woman's Hour interview that she did - as winner of the Orange Prize for Bel Canto - with Martha Kearney. They discussed Truth &amp; Beauty, then in progress. Ann appeared to believe that after the success of Bel Canto, critics would judge her less harshly for a work of nonfiction. </p> <p>Around that time, Publishers Weekly in the US noted Ann's forthcoming work of nonfiction about Lucy, referring to her as the \"heavily disfigured writer who killed herself\". I was alarmed. Had HarperCollins released such a coarse and incorrect press release? But my concerns were brushed aside. Apparently it was a misunderstanding. Then I was alerted to reading guides published for the posthumous reissue of Autobiography Of A Face, with Ann's afterword. One of the questions for discussion concerned my mother's parenting skills. I cried almost incessantly with frustration. It was put down to the work of an inexperienced intern. </p> <p>Three months before Lucy died, my mother's depression took on the symptoms of dementia. I felt I had lost her. She had not been well for years - a huge source of sadness to me. Despite the efforts of my sister Sarah and I to help her, she was becoming more frail, more sad, more alone. Our conversations became surreal. Each one sent me deeper into despair. I was grieving for her. I tried to come to terms with the fact that she would never, after all, have the capacity for happiness. When Lucy died, I was already suffocating with loss. </p> <p>On the morning of the funeral, my mother sat in her wheelchair crying, as she often did, terrified by her own constant fears. Sarah and I hugged her, trying, as we have both done all our lives, to protect her from her overwhelming despair. We have never told her that Lucy is dead. </p> <p>In the spring of 2003, Ann was working, writing and living in what she described to me as \"the Lucy factory\". I thought this was offensive, but didn't say. She mentioned film rights. I was living in frightening and unfamiliar territory. For whom was this suffocating grief I felt? For my mother? For Lucy? The sadness that Lucy's many other friends wrote about addressed only a tiny fraction of the tragedy my family had experienced. I envied the precision of their grief. How easy to focus on just one chapter of the intertwined lives of my father, dead at 57 from pancreatitis; my eldest brother, a schizophrenic, dead following a car accident in Nevada; my little sister, dead; my mother, subject to the idle scrutiny of book clubs across America, invited by those reading guides to judge her worth as a parent. </p> <p>I'd had a framed photograph of Lucy for many years, which I loved. The only word I can think of to describe it is honest. I had loved it while she was alive, for the texture of her skin, for the closeness of her teeth, for a quality of nearness that made me feel if I looked at it long enough, she would blink. Now I looked at it and thought, who is this person? A public person, with a \"legacy\", with \"work\", by which we felt obliged to do the right thing. But what was the right thing? My husband said he could gauge my mood by whether he found the photograph hanging on the wall or hidden behind the chest of drawers in the spare room. </p> <p>I was incapacitated with confusion. I felt, without being able to express it, that it was somehow indecent to risk laying my family bare for the sake of Ann's personal expression of grief. I was afraid that with the publication of her book, there might be more inexperienced interns, another set of unsavoury reading guides, another reason for people to ask, \"But where was Lucy's mother?\" </p> <p>I wished that Ann would not publish the book. I admired and had defended her need to write as an artist, but I hoped she would finish it off, for herself, and put it under the bed. I'd have preferred her to work with a smaller publisher, one with less of a publicity machine than HarperCollins. That she'd ask for no publicity. I wanted her to wait until my mother was dead. </p> <p>She felt it was her right, even her obligation, to write the book, and that it had to be HarperCollins because that was her publisher. </p> <p>One evening before that conversation, when Ann was in London, we had walked arm in arm after dinner towards Notting Hill Gate. I told her I believed that Lucy, dead and thus completely free of the worldly obstacles of vanity and rivalry, would want us to console each other. I knew that Lucy, stripped down to the essence of sister and daughter, would want us to be happy together. Ann disagreed - she felt that Lucy would still be jealous of our developing friendship. It was almost as if she was excited by the idea. </p> <p>Ann and I have not been in touch for some time. She offered a sum in exchange for permission to use Lucy's letters to her in Truth &amp; Beauty. Sarah and my brother Nicholas felt it was fair, a contribution towards the burden of my mother's care - she was living in sheltered accommodation paid for by Sarah and me. I told them to do what they felt was right. </p> <p>My sister Lucy was a uniquely gifted writer. Ann, not so gifted, is lucky to be able to hitch her wagon to my sister's star. I wish Lucy's work had been left to stand on its own. </p> <p>There is a memory, one of thousands, that I would like to keep of Lucy. She is walking with my mother and me in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, near where my mother lived for many years. It is a warm and humid early evening, and I am taking photographs of them in a graveyard, trying to be arty. Lucy is wearing shorts, my mother a white linen shirt. One picture is of Lucy's back and my mother's face. Another is of my mother's back and Lucy's face. The one picture that I can't focus on quickly enough is when they both turn to look at me, laughing, their foreheads nearly touching. </p> <p>Why is that memory so elusive? Because it is so precious? Because it is mine alone, one that I don't have to share with the hundreds of thousands of total strangers who think they understand Lucy through Ann Patchett's personal vantage point? </p> <p>Truth &amp; Beauty has enhanced Ann's reputation as a writer, though many have questioned the speed with which she published it, and the validity of exposing Lucy's frailties, not apparent in Autobiography Of A Face. I'm sorry I stood by as this happened. </p> <p>My sister Sarah and I have been travelling too long in the land of grief, and we would like to come home, to prop our pictures on the mantelpiece and to get on with our lives. But there is the book: what can we do with a grief thief?</p>",
  "Human rights groups warned yesterday that racism was becoming increasingly tolerated in Italy after the country's biggest-selling newspaper published a book by a veteran journalist which warns of an Arab invasion of Europe. <p>The 126-page tract by Oriana Fallaci appeared on newsstands with the Corriere della Sera newspaper. </p> <p>In the book Fallaci makes sweeping criticisms of authorities for failing to stop Europe becoming \"Eurabia\" and \"a colony of Islam\", in a stealthy process she describes as the \"burning of Troy\". </p> <p>Oddly, Fallaci interviews herself in the book, the third volume the New York-based journalist has written against Islam since the September 11 attacks in New York. The first two have been bestsellers in Italy and elsewhere. </p> <p>\"This kind of argument does a lot of damage,\" said Luciano Scagliotti, head of the Italian branch of the European Network Against Racism. </p> <p>\"We are very worried. Fallaci and others like her are using their popularity to create hatred. She is effectively telling thousands of people they must chase the Arabs out of Europe. </p> <p>\"It's a kind of racism that was unacceptable in Europe until a few years ago. Now, with this kind of publication, it is becoming acceptable. The more these books are published the more people even feel urged, encouraged and justified in wanting to chase the 'enemy' out of Europe. </p> <p>\"It's exactly the same thing we saw in Italy when the laws were brought in against the Jews in 1938.\" </p> <p>Human rights groups and immigration experts have warned that Fallaci's message, along with the frequently xenophobic messages from the Northern League, a member of Silvio Berlusconi's government coalition, feeds on fear of foreigners in a country that has only experienced mass immigration in recent decades. </p> <p>The Muslim community, now the second largest religious group in Italy, is made up of more than 800,000 first or second generation immigrants. Yet they are not formally recognised as a religious group. </p> <p>The Italian government has signed accords with representatives of most other, much smaller religious groups, but Islam remains on the sidelines. The fragmented Italian Muslim community has failed to identify one official religious representative. </p> <p>Fallaci's first book written after September 11, The Rage and the Pride, was an international bestseller, selling more than a million copies in Italy alone. Her follow-up, The Force of Reason, published in April this year as a tribute \"to the dead of Madrid\", has already sold 800,000 copies in Italy. </p> <p>Her latest book attacks world leaders including George Bush, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Henry Kissinger. But most of her venom is saved for Islamist terrorists, anti-war protesters and anyone leftwing, accusing protesters of \"intellectual terrorism\" and being \"brainwashing\", \"philo-Islamists\" who would happily allow Osama bin Laden to live in Italy. </p> <p>The veteran war correspondent warns of inertia comparable to that of Europe in 1938 in the face of the Arab threat. </p> <p>The Corriere della Sera, which belongs to RCS media group, hails Fallaci as \"a woman who has the courage to write the truth about others and herself.\"</p>",
  "<p>Increasing numbers of unprovoked shark attacks on swimmers could be linked to the formation of immense oxygen-starved dead zones in the world's oceans, according to American scientists. </p> <p>Three people have been bitten by sharks off the Texas coast this year, compared to only 18 attacks in the past 24 years, leading researchers to believe they may be linked to a dead zone which this year has spread across 5,800 square miles (15,020 sq km) of the Gulf of Mexico . </p> <p>The zone, caused by the runoff of sewage and nitrate-based fertilisers from intensive farming, is deprived of oxygen and kills all fish within it. It also forces marine life near it to seek better water and come closer inshore. The one in the Gulf of Mexico this year is much closer to shore. </p> <p>Terry Stelly, an ecosystem biologist with the Texas parks and wildlife department, said increasing numbers of sharks had been recorded in recent years in the waters along the Texas-Louisiana border, near the edge of the dead zone. \"The chances are good they [sharks] are looking for higher dissolved oxygen in the water\", he said. </p> <p>Nancy Rabalais, of Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium said: \"The higher number of sharks in shallow waters may very likely be due to the low oxygen being close to the shore at the time of the attacks. The available habitat for the sharks is definitely less when the low oxygen is so widespread.\" </p> <p>According to the UN environment programme (Unep), there could now be more than 150 dead zones around the world: more than twice as many as 15 years ago. The largest are off the coasts of South America, China, Japan, south-east Australia and New Zealand. </p> <p>The number of unprovoked shark attacks has also risen in the same period, but this is usually attributed to the growth of tourism in shark-infested regions. </p> <p>The Gulf of Mexico's dead zone this year extends 250 miles (400km) west from the mouth of the Mississippi river in south-eastern Louisiana to near the Texas border. </p> <p>Its size varies each year depending on weather conditions but averages about 5,000 square miles (12,950 sq km) and remains in place until late September or early October. </p> <p>Almost nothing is being done to stop the flow of nitrates into the river. </p> <p>Klaus Toepfer, Unep's executive director, said: \"Humankind is engaged in a gigantic experiment as a result of the inefficient ... over-use of fertilisers, the discharge of untreated sewage and the ever-rising emissions from vehicles and factories. </p> <p>\"The nitrogen and phosphorous from these sources are being discharged into the environment, triggering sometimes irreversible effects.\"</p>",
  "To the dismay of opposition groups in Venezuela, and to the surprise of international observers gathering in Caracas, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez is about to secure a stunning victory on August 15, in a referendum designed to lead to his overthrow. <p>First elected in 1998 as a barely known colonel, armed with little more than revolutionary rhetoric and a moderate social-democratic programme, Ch\u00e1vez has become the leader of the emerging opposition in Latin America to the neo-liberal hegemony of the United States. Closely allied to Fidel Castro, he rivals the Cuban leader in his fierce denunciations of George Bush, a strategy that goes down well with the great majority of the population of Latin America, where only the elites welcome the economic and political recipes devised in Washington. </p> <p>While Ch\u00e1vez has retained his popularity after nearly six years as president, support for overtly pro-US leaders in Latin America, such as Vicente Fox in Mexico and Alejandro Toledo in Peru, has dwindled to nothing. Even the fence-sitting President Lula in Brazil is struggling in the polls. The news that Ch\u00e1vez will win this month's referendum will be bleakly received in Washington. </p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez came to power after the traditional political system in Venezuela had self-destructed during the 1990s. But the remnants of the ancien r\u00e9gime, notably those entrenched in the media, have kept up a steady fight against him, in a country where racist antipathies inherited from the colonial era are never far from the surface. Ch\u00e1vez, with his black and Indian features and an accent that betrays his provincial origins, goes down well in the shanty towns, but is loathed by those in the rich white suburbs who fear he has mobilised the impoverished majority against them. </p> <p>The expected Ch\u00e1vez victory will be the opposition's third defeat in as many years. The first two were dramatically counter-productive for his opponents, since they only served to entrench him in power. An attempted coup d'\u00e9tat in April 2002, with fascist overtones reminiscent of the Pinochet era in Chile, was defeated by an alliance of loyal officers and civilian groups who mobilised spontaneously and successfully to demand the return of their president. </p> <p>The unexpected restoration of Ch\u00e1vez not only alerted the world to an unusual leftwing, not to say revolutionary, experiment taking place in Venezuela, but it also led the country's poor majority to understand that they had a government and a president worth defending. Ch\u00e1vez was able to dismiss senior officers opposed to his project of involving the armed forces in programmes to help the poor, and removed the threat of a further coup. </p> <p>The second attempt at his overthrow - the prolonged work stoppage in December 2002 which extended to a lockout at the state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, nationalised since 1975 - also played into the hands of the president. When the walkout (with its echoes of the CIA-backed Chilean lorry owners' strike against Salvador Allende's government in the early 1970s) failed, Ch\u00e1vez was able to sack the most pampered sections of a privileged workforce. The company's huge surplus oil revenues were redirected into imaginative new social programmes. Innumerable projects, or \"missions\", were established throughout the country, recalling the atmosphere of the early years of the Cuban revolution. They combat illiteracy, provide further education for school dropouts, promote employment, supply cheap food, and extend a free medical service in the poor areas of the cities and the countryside, with the help of 10,000 Cuban doctors. Redundant oil company buildings have been commandeered to serve as the headquarters of a new university for the poor, and oil money has been diverted to set up Vive, an innovative cultural television channel that is already breaking the traditional US mould of the Latin American media. </p> <p>The opposition dismiss the new projects as \"populist\", a term customarily used with pejorative intent by social scientists in Latin America. Yet faced with the tragedy of extreme poverty and neglect in a country with oil revenues to rival those of Saudi Arabia, it is difficult to see why a democratically elected government should not embark on crash programmes to help the most disadvantaged. </p> <p>Their impact is about to be tested at the polls on August 15. Vote \"Yes\" to eject Ch\u00e1vez from the presidency. Vote \"No\" to keep him there until the next presidential election in 2006. The opposition, divided politically and with no charismatic figure to rival Ch\u00e1vez to front their campaign, continue to behave as though their victory is certain. They discuss plans for a post-Ch\u00e1vez government, and watch closely the ever-dubious and endlessly conflicting opinion polls, placing their evaporating hopes on the \"don't knows\". They still imagine fondly that they can achieve a victory comparable to that of the anti-Sandinistas in Nicaragua in 1990. </p> <p>Yet their third attempt to derail the government is clearly doomed. The Ch\u00e1vez campaign to secure a \"No\" vote has struck the country like a whirlwind, playing to all his strengths as a military strategist and a political organiser. A voter registration drive, reminiscent of the attempt to put black people on the election roll in the United States in the 1960s, has produced hundreds of thousands of new voters. So too has a campaign to give citizenship to thousands of long-term immigrants. Most will favour Ch\u00e1vez, and Ch\u00e1vez supporters are already patrolling the shanty towns and the most remote areas of the country to get the vote out on August 15. One unexpected bonus for Ch\u00e1vez has been the dramatic and perhaps semi-permanent increase in the world oil price. As he explained to me a few days ago, he is now able to direct the extra revenues to the poor, both at home and abroad, for Venezuela supplies oil at a discount price to the countries of Central America and the Caribbean, including Cuba. Ch\u00e1vez celebrated his 50th birthday last month, and he has talked of soldiering on as president for years in order to see through the reforms he envisages. That is not such an improbable proposition. </p> <p>He has also been helped by the changing political climate in Latin America. Other presidents have been climbing over themselves to be photographed with him. He has patched up relations with Colombia and Chile, hitherto cool, and last month reinforced his friendly relations with Brazil and Argentina by signing an association agreement with the Mercosur trading union that they lead. Once perceived by his neighbours as a bit of an oddball, he now appears more like a Latin American statesman. Up and down the continent he has become the man to watch. </p> <p>Faced with a Ch\u00e1vez victory, the opposition may yet turn in desperation to violence. His assassination, hinted at recently by former president Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, or the deployment of paramilitary forces of the kind unleashed in recent years in Colombia, is always a possibility. Yet the more civilised sectors of the opposition will set themselves, with luck, to the difficult task of organising a proper electoral force to challenge Ch\u00e9vez in 2006. When I asked an uncommitted bookseller whether he would vote to sack the president in mid-term, he replied: \"No, they should let him get on with the job.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Richard Gott is the author of In the Shadow of the Liberator: Hugo Chavez and the Transformation of Venezuela, published by Verso; his latest book, Cuba: A New History, will be published next month by Yale University Press </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Rwgott@aol.com\">Rwgott@aol.com</a></p>",
  "Carmen bin Ladin and her daughters, Wafah, Najia and Noor, are the only Bin Ladins in the western world to be listed in the telephone book. They live in Switzerland, where Carmen grew up and where she fled to 20 years ago from her marriage to Osama's older brother, Yeslam bin Ladin. I am to meet her at a hotel on Lake Geneva today, because she wants to talk about what life was like inside the Bin Laden clan (she differentiates between her immediate family and the wider Bin Ladens by altering the spelling of the name - her only concession to obscurity). For nine years she lived at the heart of the world's most notorious family and the only way to exorcise this, she believes, is to spill the beans. The Bin Ladens would like her to shut up; but she will not even go ex-directory. <p>Unsurprisingly the lives of Bin Ladin and her children have been enormously difficult since September 11. We sit on the hotel terrace. Bin Ladin twitches and jitters, chain smoking, and apologising for her English. Her father was Swiss, her mother Iranian and she grew up speaking French in Geneva. When people walk by, she lowers her voice. </p> <p>Bin Ladin's book, The Veiled Kingdom , is one she would rather not have written, given the hostility it will in all likelihood generate from an already hostile family. But she wanted to explain to her daughters why she fled their father's house and, to the world, why she continues to carry his name. She also, I gather, hopes that the book will do something to alleviate the loneliness of her position; she is at once exiled from the society of her husband and from polite society in the West, where the name Bin Ladin doesn't open many doors. \"For 14 years I fought alone. And nobody believed me. I fought the Bin Laden clan in private.\" This is a plea for her struggle to be recognised. </p> <p>Carmen Dufour met Yeslam Bin Laden in 1973, when he rented a floor of her mother's house in Geneva for the summer. She was already accustomed to luxury; her mother's family, the Sheibanys, were Persian aristocrats. But Yeslam came from a background of quite staggering wealth. He was 24, a little older than her, the 10th son of Sheikh Mohamed bin Laden, one of the wealthiest men in Saudi Arabia. After they married, they moved to Los Angeles to study at the University of Southern California and then, in 1976, Yeslam asked her to return to Jeddah with him, so he could work in the family firm: multi-billion dollar construction company, the Bin Laden Corporation. She reluctantly agreed. \"I loved my husband,\" she says. \"That's it.\" </p> <p>The life that awaited her in Saudi Arabia was one that her husband tried to prepare her for, but which still came as a shock. They moved to Kilometre Seven, a district of Jeddah where most of Bin Laden Sr's 22 wives, 25 sons and 29 daughters lived. Bin Ladin made her first mistake minutes after stepping off the plane, where one of Yeslam's brothers had come to meet her. \"Hi, Ibrahim!\" she called and wondered why he frowned so, before remembering that women were not permitted to speak to men in public. She would make the same mistake, some time later and to more violent effect, with another of Yeslam's brothers: Osama. </p> <p>In the meantime Bin Ladin had some fitting in to do. She writes in the book that adapting to Saudi life was like undergoing an anaesthetic. \"Only the men could come and go as they pleased. We women were confined to the house . . . even to go into the garden we had to notify the male employees to vacate the premises.\" She couldn't go anywhere without a chaperone. \"We took no exercise. Walking anywhere was unthinkable. Hotels, sports arenas, theatres, swimming pools, restaurants, if they existed at all, were only for men.\" And yet, she says, she had high hopes for the future both of the country and of her marriage; Yeslam was one of the more liberal of the brothers, a fact he had demonstrated while they were engaged by \"allowing\" her to smoke in front of his brothers. Breaking with custom, he asked her opinion before making decisions and groused to her about the inefficient workings of the family business. </p> <p>The life she led was subtly superior to that of her sisters-in-law: she didn't wear a veil when travelling by car; she held tennis parties at the house; she smuggled in banned books from trips to Switzerland (the Bin Laden name ensured that her luggage was never searched); and she was permitted by her husband to instruct the carpet-fitters on what she wanted for their front room. (They threw a fit at being spoken to by a woman and went straight to Yeslam, who backed his wife.) She won a major feminist victory by crossing the road unaccompanied. Things were looking up. </p> <p>And then she met Osama. He was a student at the King Abdel Aziz University in Jeddah. When she opened the door to him one day, he freaked out. Her face was uncovered. Osama started flapping his hands and wouldn't come in until she had made herself scarce. She only met him a couple of times after that. While his zealousness was extreme, he did not seem remarkable to her, either within the family or the wider Saudi culture. \"He was very religious, but he was not the only one being that religious. He had other brothers who were that religious. Some of the other brothers seemed more westernised, like my husband, but deep down their beliefs were closer to Saudi Arabia than the western world. Deep down this was their way of seeing.\" </p> <p>Contrary to her expectations, the country never did liberalise and it wasn't until Bin Ladin had her second child that she began to exhaust her husband's liberal streak. He resented the way she was bringing them up. He told her the children were not permitted to celebrate their birthdays as this was a Christian affectation. He made no attempt to assuage his wife's concerns about what would happen were he to die: in Saudi culture, the widow is bequeathed to her husband's surviving male relatives. They lived in palatial splendour (she cattily remarks in the book that the Bin Ladens have no taste in interior decor, all gold taps and terrible paintings) and it wasn't unusual for Yeslam to give her $50,000 to go out shopping with. But he started to exclude her from his decisions and, after a fall-out with his brothers, he struck out alone and made another fortune - she puts it at $300m - when he set up Saudi Arabia's first brokerage firm. The deranged double life they led wore her out; one weekend she and the girls would be water-skiing in France, the next encased in black cloth, virtual prisoners in their own home. </p> <p>\"There was always a part of me that kept worrying about the future of the girls. I sometimes wonder whether I'd have been so observant if I had had two boys. You see? My main responsibility went to the future of my daughters.\" </p> <p>As the marriage disintegrated, she started to think about getting out. \"I didn't know any other foreigner who was married to a Saudi who was able to keep her children and bring them up.\" Luckily Bin Ladin had kept her Swiss passport and in 1985, on a trip to Geneva, she informed her husband that she had no intention of returning to Saudi. They lived together in Switzerland for a while and had a third daughter, but the marriage was effectively over and in 1994 Carmen started divorce proceedings. They are still going on. For a while she kept in touch with some of her sisters-in-law in Saudi, but they have been silent since September 11. </p> <p>When news of the attacks reached her, Bin Ladin says she thought immediately of her brother-in-law. She hadn't spoken about him with her husband since 1994, when Yeslam told her that Osama was in Sudan. But she had followed his activities in the press, his connection to the first bombing of the World Trade Centre and that of the US embassy in Tanzania. \"And when the second plane hit, I knew that their name would be involved.\" </p> <p>All of which makes it so strange that she should choose to hang on to the name. \"I discussed it with the girls and we realised very deeply . . . we came to the conclusion that unfortunately the name is too well known; that people would just say, 'Oh, in reality she is a Bin Laden, she changed her name.' Like people still talk about Hitler's nephew changing his name. There is no escape. The best thing is to face it and to explain that we are westerners carrying the name. We fought to gain our freedom; the truth always comes out.\" </p> <p>After the attacks, the phone more or less stopped ringing. All four of them lost friends. They couldn't get bookings in hotels or restaur-ants. Some months before the attacks, her eldest daughter, Wafah, had returned to Switzerland from the US where she'd studied law at Columbia University. She decided not to go back. They have visited the US once since then, informing the US embassy in advance so as not to cause panic at immigration when their name was read on their passports. </p> <p>Wafah is 26 and finding it hard to get work, as is her 24-year-old sister (the youngest is still at school). \"It is understandable,\" says Bin Ladin, \"that an employer may worry whether his clients will be offended that he has hired a Bin Laden. The situation is very complicated and I don't know when it is going to clear up. These three girls are trapped. It's a fact they carry a name, it's a fact they have values that don't correspond to that name.\" </p> <p>They have been totally rejected by the Bin Laden clan. \"When they come to Europe they don't even call. Since 9/11 not even their father has called to see how they are coping with this situation.\" And she is unconvinced that they have cut off all ties with Osama. \"They have never condemned Osama. They have condemned the terrorist act. But they have never admitted any involvement of their brother in those acts. He has sons in Saudi Arabia who work at the organisation. When my mothers-in-law used to speak of him, especially after he had gone to Afghanistan, it was with pure admiration. They respect his faith.\" </p> <p>The life Bin Ladin lives in Geneva is not a happy one, but where, she asks, can she go? She feels as if she has been fighting for a very long time. She is tired now, but she hopes her resources will outstrip those of her husband and his family. \"You cannot change, you cannot hide, you have to face it. Our only way out is to explain. We stand and this is how we are.\" She puts her hands over eyes. She is shaking.</p>",
  "The overpowering stench of human waste hangs heavily on the humid air. In the 37C heat preceding the imminent monsoon, it is almost suffocating. But the smell is not surprising when you know that the wetlands to the east of Kolkata, or Calcutta as the teeming metropolis used to be known, receive some 680m litres of raw sewage every day. Amazingly, the wetlands' mosaic of ponds, lakes, channels and swamps are the only sewage treatment facilities the 12 million or so inhabitants of the city have. <p>And that's not all: the wetlands are also the destination for more than 3,000 tonnes of municipal waste produced in Kolkata each day. Despite being a sink for the less pleasant products of a vast city, the wetlands are also important for conservation. An impressive range of migrant and -resident birds and animals can be spotted there, including the endemic marsh mongoose. </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, given they are in part rubbish dump and sewage works, the east Kolkata wetlands are listed under wetlands of international importance by the Ramsar Convention. This is not solely because of their wildlife value; primarily it is because the ecosystem supports diverse human activities, and therefore - theoretically - could advance the convention's objective of promoting sustainable use of wetlands - as well as their protection. </p> <p>Use of the wetlands is intense. The roads that bring visitors from Kolkata pass through the areas where the city's waste is dumped. It is sorted by bands of so-called rag pickers. People existing on the margins of society process the waste into neat piles of translucent polythene, sparkly piles of aluminium foil fragments, mounds of glass, scrap metals and, the real prize, compost. </p> <p>The work is filthy and dangerous. Broken glass and clinical waste are mixed in with the unsorted waste. The pickers, including young children, have no protective clothing, not even gloves. Under these dreadful conditions, the pickers manage to scratch a living. Sorted materials are sold for recycling, while the compost is spread on plots of land that produce a variety of vegetables. </p> <p>Adjacent to the little vegetable plots, sewage arrives from the city along slow flowing channels. As the solids separate out, the ponds are dredged and the black solids spread on to the small fields and garden plots that intersperse the wet areas. This material, along with the compost and irrigation from the waste water, helps the people who live and work on the wetlands to produce tonnes of vegetables. </p> <p>Once solids are dredged out, the liquid fraction is passed to pools filled with fast-growing water hyacinths. These tough but rather at tractive plants not only accumulate biomass but absorb some of the heavy metals and other toxins released from small-scale industries, such as tanneries. </p> <p>When the organic pollution in the water is partly diminished by the plants, it is used to top up fish ponds. All across the wetlands there is fish rearing - and on a grand scale. About a dozen species of freshwater fish are raised, in more than 300 ponds covering about 35 square kilometres. Between them, they produce a staggering 13,000 tonnes of fish a year, much of it consumed in Kolkata. </p> <p>Some 50,000 people depend on the wetlands for their living: growing vegetables, trading and making nets, or maintaining the channels. The fish rearing alone supports a workforce of about 8,000 people. Many also rear pigs and ducks. The pigs run semi-wild and eat whatever they can find. The ducks are fattened with aquatic snails harvested from the ponds. </p> <p>Sustaining this unique system should be a priority for policy makers, and researchers, including a group from the University of Stirling in Scotland, are embarked on that process. If the lives of the people and the economy of this place can be better understood, then perhaps their welfare can be improved, alongside moves toward long-term sustainable management. The alternative is the development of the wetlands for ur ban expansion, that would, in turn, lead to a loss of food for the city and necessitate the construction of expensive sewage works. </p> <p>There are problems. The expansion of Kolkata and the ever present pressure of development is thought by some to be the reason why no official boundary map of the Ramsar-listed area has been published. The government of West Bengal, it is thought, is hedging its bets on where development will go before committing to a legally binding boundary. </p> <p>Siltation is a growing problem as well, with many of the fish ponds gradually filling up. If the wetlands are to survive, then large-scale dredging will be needed. And as the city grows ever larger, so the volume of sewage and waste grows, too. How long the wetlands can accommodate that growth is not known. </p> <p>One of the few new commitments made by governments at the 2002 Johannesburg summit on sustainable development was to improve access to sanitation. However, if there is really a context of sustainable development in which that aim will be pursued then not only should there be an emphasis on concrete, pipes and electricity but also an appreciation of the central role that can be played by people, habitats and farming. </p> <p> Tony Juniper is the executive -director of Friends of the Earth</p>",

  "Father Michael Prior, who has died aged 62 following a fall from a ladder, was priest of the Vincentian Congregation, professor of biblical theology at St Mary's College, Surrey University, and a passionate liberation theologian - at a time when this radical understanding of the Christian gospel was meeting with cool scepticism in Rome. He saw no conflict between scholarship and political commitment to the oppressed; to follow St Vincent de Paul, and to walk in the steps of the radical rabbi Jesus of Nazareth, was to be on the side of the poor, not in general but in particular. <p>Michael chose a cause conditioned by his studies in the Holy Land: the injustice, as he saw it, suffered by the Palestinian people since the establishment of the state of Israel. His last article, published since his death in the Tablet, warned that the Catholic- Jewish liaison committee's decision to equate anti-Zionism with anti-semitism was a grave mistake. He was convinced, as were most Jewish theologians at its beginnings, that Zionism, the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state, flew in the face of the Hebrew scriptures. </p> <p>Warm-hearted and nearly always good humoured, he rejoiced in many friends of all religions and none. But with quintessentially Irish fighting spirit, he was not afraid to make enemies; his humour left him when he was faced with what he felt to be purveyors of injustice and humbug. </p> <p>Born in Cork, Michael was educated by the Christian Brothers. He studied science at University College, Dublin, and completed his theological studies in 1969. After ordination, he joined the Vincentians, took up the study of semitic languages and gained his licence in sacred scripture in Rome in 1972. Studies in the theology of St Paul led to a doctorate at King's College London. </p> <p>Returning from Rome, he spent three years as director of the Vincentian Formation, and then taught for two years at Ullathorpe grammar school, Coventry. In 1977, he went to St Mary's College, first as lecturer in theology, then as department head (1987-97), and, from earlier this year, as professor. </p> <p>Most formative in Michael's life was a sabbatical year in Jerusalem, and a year spent as visiting professor of theology at Bethlehem University. This experience enabled him to root his praying, thinking and teaching in the life of the people of the Holy Land. </p> <p>In 1982, he became co-founder and chair of Living Stones, an ecumenical organisation dedicated to promoting links between Christians in the Holy Land and Christians in Britain. He did every thing possible to support the dwindling number of Christians, caught between Jewish and Islamic nationalisms in the Middle East. Living Stones promoted pilgrimages from Britain, concerned primarily with the daily lives of local people rather than with the holy sites. </p> <p>Though he rejected ivory-tower academia, Michael was nevertheless a respected scholar and author. The Bible And Colonialism: A Moral Critique (1997) was an examination of the way in which the narratives of the Hebrew exodus and the Spanish conquest had been utilised to justify colonialism in Latin America, South Africa and, of course, Palestine. </p> <p>Michael was convinced of the active and passive collusion of much western biblical scholarship with the enforced removal of the Arab popula tion from its ancestral lands. Though it is now religiously underwritten by the Orthodox rabbinate - and by many fundamentalist Christians - Michael saw what is now generally admitted to have been ethnic cleansing as a secular plan long predating the Holocaust. </p> <p>He discovered that, in 1895, the founder of modern Zionism Theodor Herzl had written that \"we shall endeavour to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed - the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.\" In the context of the 1948 war, it was neither discreet nor circumspect, a theme explored in Michael's book Zionism And The State Of Israel: A Moral Enquiry (1999). </p> <p>Prophets are seldom recognised as reconcilers, but Michael was in no sense anti-semitic. An increasing number of Jews agreed with his critique of Israeli policies as inhumane. He stubbornly fought against the view that they were a case of Jewish self-hatred. This minority - rather than the majority - he believed, had the true interests of Israel at heart. </p> <p>That Muslims, Jews and Christians could and should live in equality and harmony was his conviction. If he was, at times, blind to Jewish fears and Arab failures, it was because of his passionate solidarity with those who had, in his eyes, become victims. </p> <p>Michael's favourite text, read at his funeral, was the story of Jesus preaching in his home-town synagogue, quoting the prophet Isaiah anointing him to preach good news to the poor, liberation to captives and freedom to the oppressed. When Jesus used this text to illustrate the idea that God's love was for foreigners - as well as for Israel - the congregation tried to lynch him. I do not think it unfair to say that Michael recognised himself in that role. </p> <p>Yes, this radical priest was singleminded to the exclusion of many things. Those who did not know him might have thought him a fanatic; those who did, however, knew a gentle man with a warm sense of humour, often at his own expense. \"Modesty,\" he liked to joke, \"is one of my chief virtues.\" </p> <p>He leaves his brother James and an extended family. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Michael Prior, priest, teacher and activist, born March 15 1942; died July 21 2004</p>",
  "<p>Sudan appeared yesterday to have bowed to international pressure over Darfur as the UN announced an agreed plan to tackle the refugee crisis and avert sanctions. </p> <p>The UN special envoy to the country, Jan Pronk, said the Sudanese government had halted military action against villages in Darfur and lifted restrictions on humanitarian assistance. </p> <p>Last Friday, the UN security council gave Sudan 30 days to disarm the Janjaweed, the Arab militias deployed by the government to suppress a revolt in Darfur. </p> <p>Mr Pronk told reporters in Khartoum: \"The government of Sudan has to be commended for keeping its promise [on action in Darfur]. We have full access and we have to make full use of this opportunity by coming in with more food, more planes, more trucks, more medication.\" </p> <p>He said he had agreed a series of measures with the Sudanese government and sanctions could be averted if there was substantial progress. </p> <p>But the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, said yesterday Khartoum still had work to do to meet the UN's ultimatum. </p> <p>He wrote in the Wall Street Journal that while the government had removed obstacles to humanitarian access, it \"has not, however, taken decisive steps to end the violence\". </p> <p>Francis Deng, a UN representative, said: \"Contrary to official statements about improvement of the security situation and the voluntary return of the displaced, I found _ persistent insecurity and human rights violations.\" </p> <p>While access had improved in some cases, \"administrative obstacles\", such as limited visas, hampered relief work. </p> <p>In Kalma refugee camp, in south Darfur, the UN reported violent disturbances on Sunday after a government official tried to persuade refugees to go back home. Police opened fire on refugees, including a man crippled by polio, and were then driven out of the camp. The Sudanese authorities blocked entrances to the camp in the standoff. Refugees told the UN 50 men from the camp were driven away in lorries. </p> <p>With international attention focused on Darfur, the Sudan is anxious to reverse the ethnic \"cleansing\" of the province. But refugees who have agreed to return home have come under renewed attack from the Janjaweed fighters. The Janjaweed are settling their families in the emptied villages as a reward for their role in the counter-insurgency action in Darfur. </p> <p>Further attacks have been reported to the UN in west Darfur. In recent days, a girl was raped while she was collecting firewood and a woman and boy were shot by militiamen who looted livestock in the Ardamata refugee camp. </p> <p>The UN is also concerned about donor cash. Britain is the leading cash donor in Darfur, but other EU governments have been slow to respond. There are an estimated 1.2 million internal refugees in Darfur, and 120,000 who have fled to Chad. </p>",
  "The government policy of dispersing asylum seekers away from London and the south-east may increase HIV transmission, medical experts warned last night. <p>They also said it may interrupt therapy and compromise care. Nineteen clinics said asylum seekers had been moved against medical advice. </p> <p>The warnings result from a survey of English sexual health clinics by specialists in genito-urinary medicine in London, and reported in the British Medical Journal. </p> <p>It is not known how many of the more than 100,000 dispersed people have HIV, but many come from areas with Aids epidemics. </p> <p>Doctors said dispersal was done at short notice or with no prior arrangement, and often without the transfer of full medical details. Only three of 56 centres had experienced the appropriate transfer of care. </p> <p>The survey, led by consul-tants in Camden primary care trust, said transferring HIV patients could lead to increasing resistance to drugs, the spread of the disease and avoidable illness and death. They said the National Asylum Support Service should seek specialist advice before moving someone. </p> <p>Asylum seekers may only receive 48 hours' notice of a move. If they refuse they face immediate loss of income, housing and legal support. </p> <p>Last week the chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, warned of the fast-growing threat from HIV in the UK.

  "<p>Peter Maxwell Davies's Antarctic Symphony has a lot to live up to. Not only does it attempt to transform the elemental power of the frozen continent into sound, it is designed as a self-sufficient musical argument, a piece to stand beside Davies's seven other symphonies. In his Prom with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, Davies himself conducted the 40-minute work and created a journey of geological momentum and symphonic drama. </p> <p>Unlike Vaughan Williams, whose Sinfonia Antarctica was based on Scott's attempt on the south pole, Davies's work was inspired by his own trip to Antarctica. The piece opened with sounds of splintering energy, snaps of brass and woodwind and cracking shards of percussion - a dramatic prelude to the whole work. </p> <p>Davies conjured the polar landscape with textures at the extremes of orchestral possibility. His ethereal string lines, rumbling bass drums and double-basses sounded like the reverberations of distant icebergs crumbling into the sea. The piece created a sense of different time-scales happening simultaneously. Fast, unpredictable music was superimposed over frozen strata of string sound and woodwind chords. It was as if the music had become a glacier in which fragments of musical rubble were suspended. At the end, material from the symphony was compressed into a crashing climax before the hollow sounds of the final bars - a vision of desolation and a post-global warming Antarctica, after the ice has melted. </p> <p>Yan Pascal Tortelier followed with a performance of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, the ancestor of every descriptive symphony. In an interpretation of fastidious attention to detail and tumultuous passion, Tortelier made Berlioz's orchestration sound as daring as anything in Davies's piece, such as the chilling passage for four timpani players and solo cor anglais at the end of the slow movement. He conducted the final Dream of a Sabbath Night with diabolical energy, as the BBCPO players extinguished Berlioz's hero with gleeful, mocking intensity.</p>",

  "<p>The scalpels and test tubes are ready. So, too, are the doctors, forensic scientists, DNA experts and anthropologists. Historians, poets, actors, professors of literature and many ordinary Spaniards, meanwhile, await with bated breath. But, 60 years after Spain's most controversial corpse was dumped in a makeshift grave alongside a one-legged teacher and two anarchist bullfighters, a row has broken out over whether to dig up and - once and for all - identify the remains of the poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. </p> <p>Spain's greatest 20th-century playwright - the author of Blood Wedding, The House of Bernarda Alba and Yerma - lies, or is assumed to lie, in a shallow grave at the bottom of a mountain slope in the small town of Alfacar, overlooking his native city of Granada. \"They say he clung to this olive tree as he died,\" explains Juan Caballero, socialist mayor of Alfacar, in the small park that the town has set up around the spot. \"They shot people here every morning at dawn for two months.\" </p> <p>Lorca was brought here on August 18 or 19, 1936, a month after the rightwing military rebellion that marked the opening of the Spanish civil war. His assassins were members of one of future dictator General Franco's death squads, \" la escuadra negra \" or \"black squadron\", who were systematically wiping out suspected leftwingers. The poet was just one of hundreds, if not thousands, dragged from their homes or prison cells and taken to the hills and ravines at the foot of the Sierra de Alfacar to be summarily, and anonymously, executed. Unlike the 2,102 people shot against the walls of Granada's cemetery, no record was kept of those brought here. </p> <p>Lorca had refused to join a political party but publicly supported leftwing causes. His La Barraca student company, which took theatre to far-flung villages and town squares, was inspired by \"Jewish Marxism\", according to his ultra-right Falangist enemies. He had signed manifestos denouncing rightwing dictators in Portugal, Germany and Latin America. Politics, however, may not have been the only reason for his murder. \"I shot him twice in the arse because he was a maric\u00f3n (homosexual),\" one of his killers, a thug called Juan Luis Trescastro, reportedly boasted. </p> <p>The son of a wealthy Granada family - but the brother-in-law of the city's socialist mayor, who was also shot - Lorca thought he would be safe in his home city. But going to a place that he had once described as having \"the worst bourgeoisie in Spain\" was a terrible mistake. Granada soon fell to the rebels. Lorca sought refuge with the Rosales family, who were prominent rightwing intellectuals, but they were not powerful enough to protect him from a local strongman, Ram\u00f3n Ru\u00edz Alonso, or the civil governor, Jos\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s, who were jointly responsible for his arrest and execution. </p> <p>Lorca's violent death, at just 38, made him one of the most famous victims of a civil war that divided the world and, 60 years later, still has the power to divide Spaniards. The attempts to dig him up, opposed by his own nieces and nephews, have helped bring some of those divisions to the fore once more. </p> <p>\"The ghosts of the civil war still float about. There are still hatreds and rancour. Some things have been passed from grandfather, to father, to son. It has not gone into history,\" admits Caballero. </p> <p>The mayor of Alfacar should know. For he is now at the centre of the row over whether the poet's body should be dug up. On the one hand, those already campaigning for a comprehensive exhumation of some 30,000 Franco victims scattered in similar graves around Spain see Lorca's case as a chance to set a precedent. If Lorca can be dug up, they will ask, why not the rest? They are backed by leftwing intellectuals who see, in Lorca, a symbol for the butchery, cultural and human, carried out in the name of Franco's doctrine of \"national Catholicism\". </p> <p>On the other hand, however, lie the poets' six nieces and nephews, members of a wealthy family, some dedicated to heading publicly funded Lorca foundations, who are still seen in Granada as influential. They are backed by conservative intellectuals whose rallying cry is: \"Let Garc\u00eda Lorca rest in peace.\" </p> <p>Ian Gibson, the Dublin-born writer whose detective work finally located Lorca's grave more than 30 years ago, disagrees. He has said that digging up the grave would provide final proof that this is, indeed, where the poet lies, and also show whether Lorca was beaten - or shot in the arse - before his death. </p> <p>The reasons given by the nieces and nephews include worries that exhumation will, deliberately or otherwise, inflame old political hatreds. They have also claimed, more bizarrely, that this may be a real-estate scam designed to build expensive summer homes on the grave site. Unfortunately, they now refuse to discuss the matter. \"They do not wish to say any more,\" said a spokeswoman at the Madrid-based Fundaci\u00f3n Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. </p> <p>In a rare public comment, niece Laura Garc\u00eda Lorca explained to El Pa\u00eds newspaper that digging up the grave would be too \"violent\". \"The things we might learn about Federico from an exhumation are relatively small; little more than the exact spot of the bodies,\" she added. \"I can't see us changing our minds.\" </p> <p>And that might be the end of it, except that Lorca is not alone. In fact, nobody has formally asked for him to be dug up and identified. The request for the grave to be found and the bodies in it identified has come, instead, from the families of the one-legged teacher, Di\u00f3scoro Galindo, and one of the anarchist barandilleros - the secondary figures of the bullfight, whose job is to rush out and sticks darts in the bull's back - buried alongside him. </p> <p>Francisco Galad\u00ed, the 56-year-grandson of one of those barandilleros, does not like going up the hill from his home in Granada to the grave at Alfacar. \"When I go there I feel as though I am treading on my grandfather's grave. I don't like it. It doesn't feel right,\" he explains. </p> <p>\"My grandfather, Francisco, was active against the fascists, and when they rebelled he was one of the first they went looking for. Our family were treated as apestados - pestilential - for years. My father never got a good job, and we had to go to schools run by priests and fascists. I lived under Franco's repression for 40 years. After 70 years, now it is time,\" he says. </p> <p>The Galad\u00ed family has left the work of their cause to a local \"historical memory\" group that is lobbying for all the victims of Franco's death squads to be disinterred. Francisco is indignant that Spain has been paying for the repatriation of the bodies of Blue Division members, the Spanish volunteers who fought for Hitler in Russia, while nothing is done for Franco's victims. </p> <p>\"Gibson said that while there was a single mass grave left, the civil war was not over, and I agree with that,\" he says. \"If one side (of the civil war) can bury their dead with dignity then it is time the other side was able to as well. The family of Garc\u00eda Lorca has to be respected, just as they respect us. But my father did not want his father to be left abandoned.\" </p> <p>At Granada University, a team of experts with experience of identifying people from mass graves around the world is ready to do the job of digging up Lorca's grave. </p> <p>\"The emotion you feel is always the same. You think about how they suffered, about what they felt. It really effects you deeply, the infinite capacity of people to do damage to others,\" explains Professor Miguel Botella, who has worked on mass graves in Chile, Mexico, Bolivia and Venezuela. </p> <p>The Granada University team agrees that, if the Lorca family is opposed, it would be wrong to identify the poet's body, though that does not mean the others should not be disinterred from the site. </p> <p>\"We have been burying people for thousands and thousands of years. It is one of our marks of culture. Only in extreme circumstances are people left without proper burial. This should be looked at from the point of view of human dignity. Politics should be left aside,\" says DNA expert Professor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Lorente, who has already worked on identifying victims from other civil war mass graves. </p> <p>\"We will probably give permission,\" says Caballero, who obviously expects a legal challenge from the Garc\u00eda Lorca family. \"But a judge will end up deciding what must be done.\" </p> <p>Lorca's whereabouts has long been an international cause celebre. HG Wells began the search when, as president of literary club, Pen, he wrote to the authorities in Granada demanding to know what had happened to his \"distinguished colleague\". He was told that nobody knew. The Franco regime continued to deny the full truth - that he was deliberately murdered on official instructions - right up until the 1970s. </p> <p>In the end, some lines from Lorca's Poet in New York eerily predict what has been happening in the 70 years since his premature, violent death. \"They combed the cafes, graveyards and churches for me/pried open casks and cabinets,/destroyed three skeletons ... \" Perhaps, just perhaps, the search will soon be over.</p>",
  "The monsoon flood which hit London and parts of southern England on Tuesday, causing sewers to overflow and thousands of dead fish to float down the Thames, was a salutary reminder of the effects of worldwide climate change in years to come. Nor was it the best time to learn that the government is scrapping a \u00a32bn scheme to save the Thames from returning to the Great Stink of the early Victorian age. The water companies, complaining yesterday that the Ofwat regulator has only allowed average price increases of 13% over the next five years (half of what they asked for) will need to be watched carefully to ensure that they invest enough in flood prevention and the renovation of obsolete sewage networks. We as citizens have an equally important role in promoting more economical water use and curbing pollution. <p>Most of us accept in theory, according to a recent ICM poll for the BBC, that human activity is responsible for changing the world's climate. Yet although nearly everyone (85%) professes willingness to make changes to help the environment, far fewer (54%) believe it will make any difference. With such scepticism, it is open to doubt just how many of those who say they will \"use the car less\" or \"take fewer flights\" will do so. Commenting on the poll, Friends of the Earth warns we are \"sleep-walking to disaster\". </p> <p>The problem is that the real disasters, from floods in south Asia to melting glaciers in the Andes, are happening a long way off and usually get only modest coverage. The latest toll for the recent Bangladesh floods is 10 million homeless, 660 people dead, and more than $6bn losses to the country's agriculture, industry and infrastructure. The shrinkage of glaciers reported this week from Peru, although it only affects a handful of people - mostly climbers and tourists - should be just as alarming. According to Peru's national environmental council, the country has lost 20% of its glaciers in the last 30 years. Similar reports are coming in from Alaska, where Nasa says glaciers are melting at a speed which increases the chance of future earthquakes. </p> <p>The government's chief scientist, Sir David King, has warned that London will be one of \"the first cities to go\" if the planet's ice continues to melt, and in April Tony Blair himself described the threat of climate change as the world's biggest problem. Yet public scepticism will only be dissolved by a real shift in priorities. As Sir David has also said, global warming is a greater challenge than global terrorism; until that message gets taken in, environmental anguish will be reserved for rainy days.</p>",
  "The security alerts in the US and the UK have also reverberated in South Africa because Pakistani police have raised the possibility that al-Qaida supporters were planning terrorist attacks in Pretoria and Johannesburg. <p>Two South Africans of Asian descent were arrested during the 12-hour gun battle with Pakistani police in the eastern city of Gujrat that led to the capture of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian wanted for the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. </p> <p>Gujrat's police chief, Raja Munawar Hussainl, alleged yesterday that the two South Africans - Zoubair Ismail, 20, an Islamic student, and Feroze Ganchi, 30, a doctor - were \"plotting attacks in their home country\". </p> <p>\"Authorities found several maps of South African cities among the items seized in the raid,\" he claimed. </p> <p>He told the Associated Press in Pakistan that the two were part of an al-Qaida cell. \"They were very well-trained terrorists because of the way they fought during the gun battle and the way they engaged us for 12 hours,\" he claimed. </p> <p>From maps and blueprints found with the two men, the Pakistani police say they believe there were several targets for attack in South Africa, including the US embassy, the Sheraton hotel and the government Union Buildings in Pretoria, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the V&amp;A waterfront shopping centre in Cape Town and the Cunard liner the QE2, which stops at Cape Town and Durban. </p> <p>As well as the two South Africans arrested in Pakistan, two other South Africans have been arrested in the United States and Mexico in recent weeks, allegedly for travelling on false passports. </p> <p>South African officials have tried to calm public fears, discounting the claims of the Pakistani authorities and assuring the public they are on top of all security threats. A government spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said the reports had little \"credible evidence\". </p> <p>South African officials said they were trying to see the two to make sure they were being being held according to the Geneva conventions. </p> <p>Family members of the two men said they had travelled to Pakistan to go on a hiking trip, and dismissed the reports of them being involved in a terror plot as \"ridiculous\". Friends said the two were quiet and serious. </p> <p>South African callers to a popular radio station expressed alarm over the threat, despite the country being an unexpected target because of President Thabo Mbeki's strong opposition to the US-led war in Iraq. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Two leaders of a mosque in Albany, New York, have been arrested in an FBI \"sting\" operation and charged with aiding a fictitious plot to buy a shoulder-fired grenade launcher to assassinate a Pakistani diplomat in New York.</p>",
  "Israel has announced plans for thousands of homes in a new settlement near Jerusalem, ignoring its undertaking in the road map to freeze settlement activity. <p>The proposed settlement, on 1,518 hectares (3,750 acres) of West Bank land, would be sited between Jerusalem and the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim and provide a bridge between them. </p> <p>It has been planned secretly for several months and yesterday bulldozers and diggers were preparing roads for fu ture building. The settlement would ring Palestinian east Jerusalem, making it impossible for east Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state. </p> <p>Earlier this week the US condemned Israel's announcement that a further 600 homes would be built in Ma'ale Adumim, where 28,000 Israelis live. </p> <p>The US has also said that Israel has done little to dismantle the illegal outposts which have sprung up in recent years. Britain has also expressed concern at the expansion of settlements in violation of the road map. </p> <p>Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, sought to assuage US concerns, telling Washington's visiting Middle East envoy, Elliot Abrams there was no plan to link Ma'ale Adumim to Jerusalem. </p> <p>But Benny Kashriel, Ma'ale Adumim's mayor, told the newspaper Ma'ariv: \"Within about six months the planning work in the housing ministry will be complete and then we will be able to present the construction plans for the city to the defence minister for approval.\" </p> <p>Last week the Guardian reported that Israel has been quietly expanding the settlements in the past three months. Aerial photographs showing fresh construction were presented to the opposition Labour party. </p> <p>The new settlement, which has not been given a name, fits in with what analysts believe is Mr Sharon's vision of a two-state solution. </p> <p>Jerusalem will be transformed into a region encompassing settlements to the north and south. It will border another block of settlements around Modi'in, which will link with the settlements around Ariel. Settlements out side these zones could be abandoned and the Palestinians would be allowed to exercise sovereignty over four disconnected areas around Jenin and Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho, and Hebron and Bethlehem. </p> <p>An evacuation from Gaza would be the first step in turning this plan into a reality, the analysts believe. </p> <p>Dror Etkes, the director of Settlement Watch, a group which monitors settlement activity, said there were \"massive infrastructure works\" between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem, and to the east of Ma'ale Adumim. \"The road map is already dead. These projects are designed to ensure it cannot be revived in the foreseeable future,\" he said. </p> <p>During a visit to Ma'ale Adumim this week, Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli defence minister, said the settlement, along with the Gush Etzion bloc, would be on the \"Israeli side\" of the \"security fence\" which Israel is building in the West Bank. </p> <p>\"I wish for us all settlement contiguity between Jerusalem and Ma'ale Adumim,\" he said. </p> <p>The Palestinians see the plan for the new settlement as another attempt by Israel to limit their ambition for a state. </p> <p>Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, told the Reuters news agency: \"This is a flagrant violation of the road map and the promise made by the Israeli government to the Americans.\" </p> <p>Diana Buttu, a legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said Palestinians had little power to stop Israel, despite a ruling against the Jewish state at the international court of justice.</p>",
  "<p>First, to declare an interest: I heard the British alto saxophonist Mike Osborne in his spine-tingling prime, and it may be that the lava-flow of his music as caught on these 1974 and 1977 recordings is more compelling in rekindling precious memories than in converting newcomers who don't know Mike Osborne from Ozzy Osbourne. </p> <p>The saxophonist's pungent, sweet-and-sour, occasionally anguished tone might twinge some teeth, and almost all the material here represents a spiky, free-jazz exploration of idiosyncratic originals. </p> <p>Yet much of the playing, both collectively and individually is scaldingly brilliant, and the trio tracks reveal not only what a tumultuous force Osborne was, but also that the South African bass and drums team of Harry Miller and Louis Moholo was entitled to be up there with Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins. </p> <p>Osborne's own phrasing, carried on a strangely guttural, quacky tone sometimes smoothing into pure, soaring flights, often suggests ideas split between alternative paths and somehow splicing both, and the Ornette Coleman influence is very strong. Bassist Miller is firm yet mercurial; Moholo is frequently quiet and brooding but periodically erupts into fierce snare-bursts, and his straight-time playing is electrifying. The quintet on Marcel's Muse, including guitarist Jeff Green and trumpeter Marc Charig, sounds like a storm-tossed, rather inchoate 1970s jazz-band, but I Wished I Knew is the closest thing to a straightahead standard here, and Osborne is magnificent on it. </p> <p>Uneven and raw, but full of unflinching magic and flinty beauty.</p>",
  "<p>Last week I had to take a long plane journey and, though I try to avoid these things, my eye was drawn to the American films scrolling by on the seat-back televisions that surrounded me. One of the films caught my attention - first, by its frenetic, jerky style, which seemed to resemble that of experimental film-makers like Bruce Conner; and second, because it was shot in Mexico, a place where I have worked. So I waited, and when the film came round again, I watched it. It was called Man on Fire. </p> <p>Man on Fire is the story of a troubled former counter-intelligence agent, played by Denzel Washington. Plagued by alcoholism and a guilty past, Denzel's character gets a job as a bodyguard for a rich little American girl, resident in Mexico City. Lengthy bonding scenes follow in which, inevitably, the hardened, world-weary, cynical bodyguard learns to love the winsome little blonde. Equally inevitably, the kid is kidnapped, and - in one of those shaky-cam deal-goes-sour-sequences - the ransom money is stolen. </p> <p>After this lengthy exposition, about an hour into the picture, the little girl's parents are told their daughter is dead. And Denzel's character goes on a one-man vengeance trail against the gang who kidnapped and killed his child-friend. Up to this point Man on Fire has been visually agitated; changing styles and film stocks fast and furiously, sometimes to no clear purpose, sometimes - in the scenes of domestic panic after the kidnapping - very effectively. </p> <p>About 50 minutes into his killing rampage, our man discovers - guess what? - the little girl ain't dead! I, like everyone else on that San Francisco-bound 777, already knew this. You knew it too. So did the audience, when the film first came out. No Hollywood studio would dare offend its audience's presumed sensibilities by actually bumping off an established character-kid. There are no surprises in a big-budget studio movie, especially not one from Murdoch's Fox, the lowest common denominator of them all. </p> <p>Man on Fire presents the discovery of the girl alive as happenstance: a fortunate by-product of the hero's killing spree. And there we might leave it. Another bad film with a lousy script and a good actor, dependent on explosions and bodies flying through the air. If that were all that Man on Fire was ... but there is more to it than that. I think the movie qualifies as something new: the first authentic American action blockbuster in which the hero doesn't just go on a killing rampage, but a torture spree as well. </p> <p>Denzel Washington is one of the best American actors alive today. He generally gives great performances, and he does good work in Man on Fire. But he is playing a torturer. The problem - and I think we do have a problem here - is that this fine actor isn't doing a Ben Kingsley or a Laurence Olivier, portraying the torturer as villanous scumbag. This is a case of torturer-as-hero. In Man on Fire, Denzel cuts one Mexican man's fingers off. He sticks an explosive device - I cannot put this delicately - up another Mexican's arse. He blows yet another Mexican's hand off with a shotgun. He does this after blindfolding them with masking tape. He does it to extract information as to where their boss is. Then he kills them. </p> <p>I can't recall seeing other mainstream Hollywood movies in which the hero tortures people. Certainly, some of these films have had a masochistic streak: the younger Eastwood was forever being beaten up or burned alive, Mel Gibson's directorial oeuvre seems to stem from his being frequently cinematically tortured, and even Denzel was whipped within an inch of his life in the civil war saga Glory. </p> <p>But actively practising torture is something else. The only prior action-torturer I can recall is Dirty Harry, the rampage-oriented cop created by John Milius under the pseudonym of \"Harry Julian Fink and Rita M Fink\". Dirty, you no doubt recall, famously stamped on the injured foot of the kidnapper-killer, played by Andy Robinson, in a baseball stadium. </p> <p>I need remind no one that the dirty not-so-secret of the wars on terror, Afghanistan and Iraq, has been torture. It was the dirty not-so-secret of the war on drugs in the 1990s, and the war on communism in the 1980s, too. Then, as now, it was the torture of dark-skinned, foreign people, by American counter-intelligence experts. Then, as now, it was often sexualised torture, like Denzel's bomb-up-the-Mexican's-bum. Torture to extract information as to where the leaders are. </p> <p>We used to all agree that this was bad, and that in paying for the murder and torture of Nicaraguan and Honduran farmers, the United States had gone seriously wrong. Beginning in October 2001, a variety of Hollywood screenwriters, directors and producers, \"drawn from the movie world's A-list\" were invited to a series of meetings at the Institute for Creative Technology, affiliated with the University of Southern California. </p> <p>The ICT was set up in 1999 with a grant of $50m from the US Army to create training simulators. In the aftermath of 9/11, the A-list creatives were supposed to come up with scenarios by which terrorists might seek to attack the USA. Would it be naive to question whether this was a one-way street? Or whether the Pentagon, which already maintained film liaison offices in Los Angeles, had a few ideas for the A-list talent to work on, as well? </p> <p>Since 9/11 the \"serious\" US media have been full of opinion pieces by the likes of Alan Dershowitz and Newsweek's Jonathan Alter saying we must consider employing forms of torture so as to win the war on terror. The US military and the White House aren't averse to torture, as we already know. Our own Noble Lords are now asked to consider whether Tommy Atkins may have picked the habit up. </p> <p>Man on Fire, with its American-torturer-hero, appeared in the US just before the Abu Ghraib scandal broke. That, we can fairly certainly say, is a coincidence. It may be just another coincidence that Denzel's justified-man-of-action is - like Mr Blair's friend in the White House - an alcoholic who gives up booze for the Bible: a stereotype so hackneyed it would have been vetoed by Murdoch's execs, if this were not an election year.</p>"
