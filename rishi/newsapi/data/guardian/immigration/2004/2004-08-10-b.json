  "Last-ditch efforts to \"clean up\" Athens before the Olympic games begin on Friday have included removing thousands of immigrants, beggars, drug addicts and homeless people from the capital's streets. <p>Human rights activists said yesterday that they feared vulnerable people, including asylum seekers from war-torn countries such as Iraq, were falling victim to the campaign. </p> <p>In the count-down to the games about 70,000 police and military personnel have been drafted to patrol the capital. </p> <p>\"There is a climate of absolute terror on the streets,\" said Spyros Psychas, a member of Arsis, a charity working with the homeless and underprivileged youth. </p> <p>\"People are afraid. They're ringing in saying how unbearable the police controls have become.\" </p> <p>Underlining the concern, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees urged the Greek government to ensure that \"international standards\", including the Geneva conventions, were not being breached. </p> <p>The agency's unusual intervention followed reports in the Greek media that mass deportations had soared in advance of the games. </p> <p>Last weekend the authoritative Ta Nea reported that of the 13,766 immigrants arrested in the first six months of this year about 6,623 had been forced to leave Greece. </p> <p>Lawyers told the Guardian that they believed growing numbers of foreigners had been banished in recent weeks under fast-track procedures which allowed them no chance to appeal. Asylum seekers in Greece are often forced to wait months before being given proper papers. </p> <p>\"Recent reports regarding the 'clearing' of the streets of Athens ... create concern,\" the UNHCR's Athens branch said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Many asylum seekers lack proper identification documents and are at risk of arrest, detention and possible deportation in contravention of international standards.\" </p> <p>As the organisers have completed the building of venues and other Olympic sites, they have turned their attention to beautifying the capital. The effort has focused on the historic centre, not least the squares where thousands of immigrant street sellers, drug users and homeless people tend to gather. </p> <p>Partly because of its strategic geographic location and poverty, Greece has a large number of socially excluded people. The European Observatory on Homelessness believes that about 17,000 people are without a roof, not counting the majority of the immigrants who cross the Greek borders daily. </p> <p>A lot of \"undesirables\" are thought to have been moved on to less visible districts. </p> <p>Some people are thought to have been put in psychiatric institutions where doctors have complained of being deluged with sectioning orders from public prosecutors. </p> <p>In June the staff at the Dromokaition psychiatric hospital, one of Athens' two mental institutions, protested on the streets. </p> <p>Michalis Yannakos, leader of the hospital's trade union, said at the time: \"Following arrests, the prosecutor issues sectioning orders that force us to lock up drug addicts, alcoholics or mentally ill people.\" </p> <p>Psychiatrists told the Guardian that many of the capital's burgeoning population of drug users had mysteriously disappeared. </p> <p>The authorities deny that the police have conducted a sweep, saying that no group had been deliberately targeted.</p>",
  "Scandinavians stand the best chance of securing Olympic glory but if you happen to be from America, Turkey or Portugal then brace yourself for disappointment. <p>With two days before the start of the Athens Olympic games, athletes have been told that the size of their country's population could have a massive impact on their chances of winning a medal. </p> <p>A survey carried out by a credit card company examining the number of Olympic medals won by each country and the size of its population has found that Finland is the world's most successful Olympic nation with 14,976 people for each medal won. </p> <p>The Finns are followed by Sweden, with 16,411 people for each medal won and Norway with 29,414 people for each medal. Greece ranked 10th in the survey registering 212,326 people for each medal won. </p> <p>The survey by Visa Europe looked at the performance of 12 countries in every Olympic games since 1908, linking its medals count to the average size of its population. </p> <p>Britain came seventh overall in the survey with 87,979 people to a medal meaning that those born in Finland are five times more likely to win either gold, silver or bronze. America finished ninth with 110,524 people for each medal . Portugal was 11th at 484,543 people per medal and Turkeyranked last at 588,936 citizens per medal.</p>",
  "Fernando Martinez remembers accompanying his grandmother when she pawned the family's jewels. Now he brings his own son along when he hocks their DVDs. <p>\"I don't think there can be a Mexican who hasn't come here at least once in their life,\" Mr Martinez says of the Monte de Piedad Foundation, Mexico's network of pawnbrokers. \"We all have the need at one time or another.\" </p> <p>Founded in 1775, Monte de Piedad - which roughly translates as Bank of Compassion - is experiencing a thoroughly modern boom. </p> <p>More than 11 million people - a quarter of Mexico's economically active population - are expected to entrust their precious possessions to the foundation's ample warehouses this year, an increase of 40% over the past four years. </p> <p>Rings, chains, watches and and similar items make up 85% of Monte de Piedad's business. The rest of it includes everything from old bicycles to iPods, chipped coffee cups to cars, kitchen tables to screwdrivers. A tiny fraction consists of art and antiques that over the years has reputedly included Diego Rivera paintings and Napoleon Bonaparte's desk, which was stolen from the Louvre during the second world war. </p> <p>\"We accept anything that is not perishable,\" says Gustavo Mendez, the foundation's spokesman. \"It doesn't matter how much or how little it's worth.\" </p> <p>The average loan these days is about 800 pesos, or \u00a340. </p> <p>The drill is always the same. Stony-faced valuers examine the item and write out a chit for half of its total worth. A gold ring, for example, is appraised according to the quality of the metal and its weight alone. At Monte de Piedad, design is considered as frivolous a quality as sentimental value. </p> <p>\"They never give you what you hope for, but it's the only option we have,\" Lourdes Medellin says as she waits at a Mexico City branch to hock her husband's carpentry ruler for around 200 pesos; she has run out of cooking gas. Ms Medellin has pawned and redeemed countless objects in her time, but last year lost her wedding ring and sewing machine when her mother fell ill and needed medicines she could afford no other way. </p> <p>Sitting beside her in the queue arranged along rows of purple plastic chairs, 74-year-old Ruben Correa fiddles with a plastic bag containing a saw and other basic tools. Too old to ply his trade as an electrician, Mr Correa now keeps himself afloat selling lottery tickets in bars, but needs money to buy the tickets. </p> <p>Dozens more men, women and families have brought TVs, stereos, blenders, or whatever they can spare. Most will retrieve their possessions in a few months - 95% are redeemed - but many will be back with the same item in a few months. </p> <p>\"It's getting a little battered,\" Sandra Alcaza says of the keyboard she uses to give music lessons, which dry up during the summer holidays. \"I get less for it every time.\" </p> <p><b> Insecurity</b><br> </p> <p> The current boom at Monte de Piedad does not appear to be a sign of rising poverty. According to the World Bank, extreme poverty dropped 4% to 20% between 2000 and 2002, and poverty of all kinds stayed steady at about 50%. </p> <p>Instead, economists link the surge in pawning to increased job insecurity. Research sponsored by the UN found that the proportion of people working in the informal economy was 43% in 2002, nearly 10% more than a decade before. </p> <p>Monte de Piedad is one of the few safety nets available for workers with no steady wage and no benefits, who rarely have access to bank accounts, let alone bank loans. </p> <p>\"Me, a bank account?\" Guadalupe Nieves laughs at the idea after handing over some gold chains to pay for her young son's birthday party. \"I never thought of that.\" </p> <p>The country's pawnbrokers are making significant efforts to resell themselves as a modern short-term financing service, equivalent to taking out an overdraft. In the past few years the foundation has opened dozens of spanking new branches around the country, and this month it also launched a slick advertising campaign. </p> <p>But the interest rate of 2% a month (27% a year) is unattractive for anybody who has another financing option. </p> <p>\"Most people we see still come because they need to feed their families,\" says Efrain Tellez, who has worked as a valuer at Monte de Piedad for the past 42 years. \"What we do now is essentially the same as it was when I started, there are just more people.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a few days' time a succession of bodies honed to the purest, most extreme form of physical perfection will run, jump and spin into action in Athens. The athletes competing in the 2004 Olympics have trained to a level unachievable for most people. The benefits are obvious - medals for the best, fame and admiration around the globe, and a serotonin buzz without parallel. </p> <p>But what of the downside? While medical experts universally agree about the health benefits of physical activity, there is an optimum level. Does the physical thrashing of the body at its peak leave it weak and mangled in the post-competition years or is it an investment that pays long-term dividends? </p> <p>According to Dr Greg Whyte, director of science and research at the English Institute of Sport, the key to long-term health for Olympic athletes is not to cross the fine line between \"super physiology\" and damage. </p> <p>\"Getting this right is dependent on how well the athlete is managed,\" he says. \"There are a fair number who cross the line and this can result in unexplained under-performance syndrome, an ME-like condition that affects about 10% of elite athletes training in endurance sports.\" </p> <p>Osteopenia, a reduction in bone mineral density, is a condition that can cause long-term damage to both male and female athletes. It can lead to an increase in stress fractures although Whyte says that no one has yet proved a link with cause and effect of intensive training. </p> <p>He and his team are studying exercise-induced asthma and look ing at the impact of sports such as swimming and skiing where very high volumes of air go through the lungs on a prolonged basis. Environmental pollution absorbed into the lungs at much higher levels than that of non-competitive swimmers and skiers is thought to be a factor in the development of long-term asthma. </p> <p>Anabolic steroids, which are, of course, banned but have been used by some athletes in recent years, can also cause long-term damage to the body, including early heart disease, increased tendon damage, liver disease and changes in the composition of blood cholesterol, increasing the risks of coronary artery disease. </p> <p>Eating disorders are another occupational hazard for Olympic athletes. Research carried out at the University of Leeds found that almost one in 10 of Britain's top female distance runners had some kind of eating disorder. In the short term, reducing body fat does improve athletic performance as oxygen can be transported to the muscles more quickly. However, in the longer term it can lead to the loss of muscle bulk as well as causing osteoporosis and kidney damage. </p> <p>Managing Olympic athletes so that they can continue to raise the bar of achievement for the human body ever higher has become a highly sophisticated science. But the sheer complexity of the combination between genes, environment and training means that it is impossible to always achieve the ultimate super-physiology while at the same time insulating the body from long-term damage. Most elite athletes follow all the state-of-the-art advice available in the hope that they will not only win medals but also glide into an agile middle and old age. Then they unscientifically cross their fingers and hope for the best. </p> <p> <strong> Christopher Dean, 46</strong> With Jayne Torvill, gold for ice dancing in 1984, Sarajevo, and bronze in 1994, Lillehammer <br> </p> <p>Most of our training took place on the ice and we practised for about five hours a day. Jayne was my weights workout and I spent a lot of time lifting her. But it wasn't the conventional sort of weightlifting where you bend your knees - we always performed things off balance, which puts a lot of strain on the arms and on the lower back. Jayne used to hang off my neck quite a lot, too. Groin strains were common because of the stretches and extensions we were always doing. There was also a lot of mental stress associated with the Olympics. Everything you work for comes down to one routine of four minutes. </p> <p>When we competed as amateurs in the Olympics we would practise all year for three or four events. When we turned professional, we did eightshows a week - at the weekend we did two shows back to back - with 60 lifts per show. We didn't work out how many miles we skated but at the end of each show we would have lost 2-3lb in fluids. The hardest thing would be having to perform even if we got a bug or food poisoning. After a performance I would look like the Michelin man with ice packs on both sides of my legs, on my lower back and on my neck. </p> <p>We carried on performing together until five or six years ago. Now I choreograph shows for Stars on Ice. I have some arthritis in my knees and degenerative discs in my back because of the amount of lifting I did, but for a 46-year-old I'm OK. I've trained my body and my muscles to be a certain shape and if I maintain that, things aren't so bad. But after a hard day's choreographing, I tend to end up with the physiotherapist. </p> <p>One of the great health benefits of spending lots of time on ice is that I've got fewer wrinkles than people who spend lots of time in the sun, like tennis players and golfers. </p> <p>There was a sadistic pleasure in pushing my body to the pitch I did but I don't still hanker after that physical perfection; I've let loose now, I don't think it's healthy to stay that wound up for ever. These days I think that people who push their bodies to the ultimate goal have probably gone a bit too far and I don't think that's healthy. But I don't regret the way I pushed my body. Oh gosh, no. I wouldn't change a thing. </p> <p><strong> Colin Jackson, 37</strong> Silver medal for the 110m hurdles in 1996, Atlanta<br> </p> <p>For my training as a sprinter I had to push my body by lifting weights and be as flexible as a gymnast, as well as the running. It was a total combination of work and I would have to spend at least four hours a day on it. It was hard when the weather was dark or gloomy but I could never miss a session because then I knew it would be easier to miss a second, third or fourth training session too. </p> <p>I did push my body to its limits and because the body can only do certain things I had to train my mind to be stronger than my body. As a result, there were a few occasions when my commitment to training was too intense and my body couldn't handle it. At those times my body would literally crash and collapse. My knees have always been my biggest problem. I have had seven operations on them - one to realign the patella and the others because of cartilage problems. I've been told that the weaker the muscles around my knees become, the more chance I have of developing arthritis, so I have to keep them in shape if I want to avoid that. </p> <p>At the moment there isn't any arthritis there and I'm not doing any running. It's way too much hard work to start that again. I did start training again with guys who are still competing but I started training too intensely - it's all or nothing for me. I've just come back from a skiing holiday and if I'm bored I'll do press-ups and sit- ups, but that's it at the moment. </p> <p>I think that the most important thing any Olympic athlete can do to preserve their health long-term is to know when it's the right time to retire. If you want to retain your physical health, you have to know when to call it a day. I made sure I did everything I was supposed to do, which is why my career lasted for 18 years. I really looked after myself and I had great medical backup. It's a legacy of those years that I can still do things like the splits. </p> <p><strong> Liz McColgan, 40</strong> Silver medal for the 10,000m in 1988, Seoul<br> </p> <p>I used to train for about three and a half hours a day. I would run 145 miles a week for three weeks and on the fourth week I would have an easy week running 105 miles. I also went to the gym a couple of times a week, lifting weights and doing circuit training. These days I still run - I started when I was 11, so it's a way of life. I just go out running once a day now rather than the two or three times a day I used to go out. </p> <p>I think that, considering the amount of training I used to do, my body has done pretty well. I've got arthritis in my feet but so has my sister and she doesn't do much exercise so it's probably a genetic thing rather than caused by my running. </p> <p>I did have one serious problem with my knee but that was a result of wearing ill-fitting orthotics. I've got a lot of energy as a result of all the exercise I do. I feel it's good to push your body to its limits. Every time I push my body further than I've pushed it before it makes me feel good. Seeing how far I could push myself is what gives me a thrill in running. I still time myself and I can still achieve the same highs I achieved during the Olympics. </p> <p><strong> Mary Peters, 65</strong> Gold medal for the pentathlon (hurdles, shot, high jump, long jump and 200m) in 1972, Munich<br> </p> <p>I started competing at 16 and carried on until I was 35. I used to train for two hours a day because I was an amateur and athletics was just a hobby for me. With weightlifting, pentathlon, high jump, long jump and 200m, my body got a lot of abuse but I've just had my 65th birthday and am enjoying really good health. I've never been in hospital apart from one very minor thing overnight. I don't have any problems in my joints or anywhere else. </p> <p>I would have 860lb weights on my shoulders and would do one-arm jerks with 120lb weights. I never warmed up properly the way athletes are taught to today, I never drank three litres of water the way people are advised today and I never ate pasta before an event as athletes are advised to do today. I used to eat steak and salad and I'm absolutely fine. I ran a gym for 20 years so I kept myself pretty fit and I've just been trekking in New Zealand to raise money for Mencap, walking 100 miles over the course of eight days. </p> <p>When I was training for the Olympics I did work hard but it was just a hobby; it wasn't torture and I didn't push myself beyond my limits. I can remember one athlete saying that he was sick after every training session and that if he wasn't sick he hadn't trained properly. That didn't happen to me. These days, athletes do a lot of warming up and warming down but I just didn't have the time. I did pull a hamstring one season and I got tennis elbow early on because of poor technique in my shot-putting but that was all. I think the standard of Olympics athletes has improved enormously. I did it for fun and if I was successful that was a bonus. </p> <p>I think physical activity has always been important in the evolution of men and women and I think people move around less than they did 50 years ago. Exercising makes me feel so much better mentally and physically. </p> <p>I'm not quite as supple as I used to be but I'm lucky not to have suffered any ill effects from competing at Olympic level. I think it's partly down to genes; my brother is also fairly active and in good health. I feel as if I'm 18 even though I don't look it. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Colin Jackson is a member of the commentary team providing live coverage of the Olympics on BBC1 and BBC2, August 13-29.</p>",

  "<p>Bernard Levin, one of the past century's most devastating journalistic scourges of establishments on the right or left, has died at the age of 75, it was announced yesterday. </p> <p>For some years, his acute mind, thunderous vocabulary and relish for laughter and long sentences had been increasingly silenced by Alzheimer's disease. He spent part of his last period in a specialist London hospital. </p> <p>One of Levin's friends, the journalist Simon Jenkins, called him \"a master of prose\" and said his writing had a touch of Voltaire. Last night another friend, Lord Rees-Mogg, editor of the Times when Levin was its star columnist, said, \"He was as brilliant a columnist as we have had in Britain since the last war\". </p> <p>Levin was brought up by his grandparents and mother after his father left home, and graduated in government from the London School of Economics. In his early career on the Spectator, he made a sensational impact as the first irreverent parliamentary sketchwriter. </p> <p>He savaged an aggressive Conservative government law officer, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller as \"Sir Reginald Bullingham-Manner\" and prophetically renamed Sir Hartley Shawcross, a Labour minister veering right, \"Sir Shortly Floorcross.\" </p> <p>As the Guardian's television correspondent, he covered ITV's opening night in the 1950s. He was in at the birth of the satire movement, cross-examining politicians on the TV series That Was the Week That Was. Later the Guardian asked him to write a freelance column. But, saying that he wrote better against the grain, he opted for the Times. There from 1971 onwards, though he grew more earnest and moved politically to the right, he could still be impartial in his indignation. </p> <p>In 1983, he wrote in the Times of Michael Foot's brief spell as Labour leader: \"The sight of Mr Foot hanging himself higher and higher and higher with every shifting, gaseous, unfinished verbless unintelligible sentence which he emitted like ectoplasm [... ] was so distressing that I switched off two-thirds of the way through: I felt like a member of Greenpeace watching a month old seal pup beating its own brains out.\" </p> <p>Towards the end of his time as a writer, in June 1995, he said of Michael Howard as Conservative home secretary: \"In Howardspeak, 'Howard to close migrant loopholes' means Howard needs another boost for his ambition, as odious as it is ridiculous, so he plays the immigration card: unwanted darkies, brownies, yellowies, even whities, out, out, out. The card, of course, is not just for him alone, but for the Tories in general, as they look at the polls and sink more and more into despair.\" </p> <p>A thread which ran through Levin's 1980s Times columns was the crushing of liberty in the Soviet Union. Lord Rees-Mogg, who is on holiday in Portugal, told the Guardian: \"I think he did have very considerable influence.He was always on the side of liberty and, in domestic affairs, of justice. </p> <p>\"He was critical of establishments, whether the old establishment of the right or the Harold Wilson/trade union establishment of the left. He loved long sentences, and could handle them in a way no one else could in our time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pass rates for Highers and Standard Grade exams in Scotland have risen virtually across the board, results show today.</p> <p>The Higher English pass rate is 64%, up 4.8% and the Higher maths pass rate is 67.8%, up 1%. The percentage gaining a Standard Grade rose from 96.8% to 97.2% but the numbers taking the qualification - the equivalent of GCSEs elsewhere in the UK - fell drastically by 19,585 as more young people opted for alternative Intermediate qualifications. </p> <p>Numbers taking Advanced Highers - a two-year course akin to A-levels - rose to 17,184 and the pass rate also rose by 1%. Most candidates are school age but 110 lifelong learners aged 60 and over sat Scottish qualifications this year.</p> <p>Today's results, which will be seen as a pointer to higher pass rates south of the border next week, were welcomed by Peter Peacock, the Scottish education minister. \"We have maintained tough and high standards in our exam system, which is the envy of many countries, and we are seeing performance year-on-year moving in the right direction. This is down to strong political support and hard work by pupils, teachers and parents,\" he said.</p> <p>Anton Colella, chief executive of the Scottish Qualifications Authority, congratulated candidates. \"These results show that more candidates are achieving more in a stable and reliable system, and that is all good news for Scotland,\" he said.</p> <p>There is now a marked gap between the numbers of boys and girls taking the most advanced exams - 55% of entries for Highers and 53% for Advanced Highers were from female candidates this year. </p> <p>The timing of this year's Highers results gives Scottish candidates who missed out on their offers from universities a head start of more than a week over competitors in England, Wales and Northern Ireland when it comes to chasing places.

  "A crackdown on fraudulent applications for student visas in China is barring legitimate students from entering Britain and could leave universities \u00a370m short this year, British universities claimed yesterday. <p>The British embassy in China has tightened up its student visa process to prevent abuse, but universities say that this is barring other students from travelling to British universities this autumn. </p> <p>The moves puts at risk the attempt - backed by the prime minister - to get more international students into British universities. </p> <p>According to Universities UK, which represents university chiefs, a \"significant\" number of universities are reporting widespread failure to secure visas for their students. </p> <p>At Luton university, where 1,800 Chinese students confirmed a place for this autumn, the vice-chancellor, Les Ebdon, said that their success rate for visas applications had fallen from 70% in 2003 to 30% this year. </p> <p>Based on this decrease, he has calculated that up to 10,000 students nationwide could be barred from Britain this year. With the median fee for an overseas student being \u00a37,700, the sector stands to lose something like \u00a377m, he claimed. </p> <p>Some of Luton's students who were turned down should have been taking the last two years of a degree jointly awarded by Luton University and their home institution - proof says Prof Ebdon, that they could not have all been \"bogus\". Prof Ebdon added that the success rate of visa applications had improved within the last month. </p> <p>A Leeds university programme which has brought up to 100 Chinese students from Heilongjiang university in the city of Harbin, northern China, for the last five years, also saw their success rate fall - 78 of its 81 applicants were refused a visa this year. </p> <p>David Baker, head of the international centre at Leeds university which has sent a member of their team to China to liaise with officials, said: \"There has been no history of leakage out of this programme to illegal immigration.\" </p> <p>Middlesex university, which claims to have the largest number of international students of any institution in Britain, is also reporting problems securing visas. UK Visas, the cross-government agency which deals with applications, confirmed that the applications process had been toughened up to stop people applying for a student visa in order to gain work in Britain. \"All we're doing is seeking to deter bogus applications coming into the country,\" a spokesperson said. </p> <p>According to the British Council, last year 31,930 Chinese nationals came to study in British universities - more than double the 14,365 from America. </p> <p>The Higher Education Statistics Agency figures for the same year reveal that the total income from overseas students to universities was \u00a3875m. </p> <p>Unlike fees for home and EU students, international students are the single most flexible source of funding for cash-strapped universities - universities can charge what they like. In 1998 Tony Blair backed a campaign to increase the number of students coming to Britain. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills said: \"We welcome international students in our universities and colleges, including those from China. However, decisions on visa applications are matters for UK Visas.\"</p>",
  "Since 1997, Labour ministers have created more than 600 new criminal offences - and still counting. To judge by the prime minister's July announcements on law and order, it now seems that the well from which all these new laws have been drawn is far from dry. With crime prospectively at the centre of the general election, ministers are busy honing yet more offences, on everything from the preparation of terrorism to putting out your rubbish bags on the street on the wrong day. If they win a third term, there is a chance that by 2009 Labour will created its very own thousand-law Reich. <p>Yet the government is defiantly untroubled by charges of legislative incontinence. It appears, indeed, to welcome them. To the triangulation strategists planning Tony Blair's election campaign, it is axiomatic that the public can never have enough crack-downs. If liberals protest, New Labour's warped worldview tells them, then so much the better. The 2005 election, we can already see, will be an old-fashioned tough-guy bidding war. </p> <p>Labour's promises of new legislation are invariably voiced in the name of the victim. If challenged that their punishments are disproportionate to the crime or may be counter-productive, the reflex ministerial response is populist. Go and ask what the people who live on the estates in my constituency think, they respond. Then you will see. The crude version of this response is that Labour believes it cannot fight what its core voters read in the tabloids. A more highminded and honourable version is to insist that \"our people\" are on the sharp end, and that putting the victim at the centre of the strategy is fundamental to ending the social exclusion that blights lives and communities. </p> <p>There is, though, a problem about this. Though justified to the public in the name of the average decent and deserving person, these policies are increasingly causing unexpected and unintended problems for exactly these same decent and deserving people. And if you seek a spectacular example of this failure of what used to be called joined-up government, you need look no further than a little-noticed select committee report published less than a month ago. </p> <p>Civil legal aid is not one of those social policy issues that makes many hearts beat faster. But access to justice is a pretty fundamental fairness issue. If one side in a dispute can afford legal advice and representation, while the other one cannot, then the scales are tipped in one direction. If neither side in a dispute can get advice and representation when both require it, then the scales may not be so uneven, but the denial of justice is even worse. </p> <p>Such an understanding stands at the core of July's report on the civil legal aid system by the constitutional affairs select committee, chaired by Alan Beith MP. It also stood at the core of the Attlee government's thinking on the subject when the modern legal aid system first took shape more than half a century ago. Financial eligibility for legal aid was originally set at a level where around 80% of all households were eligible for either free advice or for advice for which they paid a means-tested contribution. By 2001, however, the proportion had shrunk to under 47%. </p> <p>The decline in eligibility, though, was only one dimension of the deepening problem. Britain has also become a very different kind of country compared with 1979. A long era of possessive individualism, especially in housing, the replacement of collective by individual rights, not least in employment law, the rapid increase in divorce, and the spread of both a rights culture - notably in discrimination law - and a financial compensation culture have all made substantial contributions to the widening of both the opportunity and need for legal advice and representation. </p> <p>But who can adequately provide such advice and representation today? The legal profession has expanded rapidly; there were 50% more solicitors in England and Wales in 2002 compared with 1992. But this growth only theoretically benefits the poorer client. Lawyers become lawyers to make a living, and the accelerating squeeze on legal aid funding means that fewer and fewer lawyers can afford to do legal aid work. This situation is likely to worsen as new entrants to the legal profession arrive carrying higher levels of personal debt in the form of increased tuition fees. Already there is talk of \"advice deserts\" in some parts of the country. </p> <p>This has happened against a political and economic background in which, as the apostate Blairites Neal Lawson and Paul Thompson put it in these pages yesterday, the country is \"saddled with a historically low level of taxation to spend on public services and to redistribute\". This is also the key problem facing civil legal aid, which, capped since 1999, accounts for an ever-declining share of the public funds now available for all forms of legal aid and assistance. </p> <p> This is where the growing negative impact of the 600 new offences comes in. Overall, the government currently spends around \u00a31.9bn on all forms of legal aid - a sum that accounts for nearly two-thirds of the Department for Constitutional Affairs annual budget. The increasing bulk of this money, however, now goes on criminal not civil legal aid. </p> <p>To hear ministers talk, and to read the headlines that their comments provoke, this expansion is wholly attributable to abuse of the system. The less newsworthy reason is simply this: the government is obsessively changing and expanding the criminal law and the asylum system, with the result that the call on public funds from such cases is gobbling up an ever-larger share of a total that the Treasury has already capped and would clearly like to cut. </p> <p>The upshot, as the select committee says, is that civil legal aid has become the Cinderella not merely of the public funded legal service, but of the government's strategy for addressing poverty and exclusion more generally. This is sharp end stuff for \"our people\", too. It may not generate the headlines that being a victim of crime can, but to be denied access to advice and justice - in a divorce, a housing complaint, or any other category of dispute - is to be just as much a victim, too. </p> <p>It is hard to know which senior minister to blame most: the prime minister, who having long ago pioneered the individual rights approach to employment law now shows no interest in allowing individuals to pursue them; the chancellor, who treats state funding for lawyers as money wasted on a privileged and inefficient service that could be better spent on more popular causes; or the home secretary, whose burdening of the statute book with more poorly conceived and drafted laws makes things worse each year. </p> <p>What is clear, however, is that ever fewer of the people who need it most are now in the position to get the advice and representation they need to make a reality of their nominal rights. They too are victims of a system which supposedly puts victims first. Whatever else this may be, it is not social justice.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The mayor of London has accused immigration officials of harassing black people after it emerged that they were questioning tube passengers speaking non-European languages. <p>Civil liberties groups, immigration campaigners and the Liberal Democrats yesterday attacked the practice, describing it as potentially racist. They also suggested it would damage the capital's tourist industry. </p> <p>Home Office guidelines explicitly prevent police from stopping people because of their accent or appearance. Last month the government promised a new stop-and-search action team to combat discrimination after figures showed that police are still disproportionately targeting black and Asian communities.</p> <p>But the Home Office yesterday defended the attempt to clamp down on illegal immigration and described it as an \"intelligence-led\" and \"targeted\" operation which had proved successful.</p> <p>The practice is part of a wider programme launched in May last year which has so far detained 1,000 suspected illegal immigrants. </p> <p>Immigration officials have questioned London Underground passengers who have been stopped by staff or British Transport police because they do not have the correct tickets. But it now emerges that officials are also taking the initiative by stopping people who they believe sound foreign, and asking them to produce papers proving their right to British residence. </p> <p>\"If you hear someone speaking a language that's not European we approach them and ask, 'Do you mind if I ask you what nationality you are?'\" an officer told the Evening Standard. \"If they get upset or start acting suspiciously we ask the police to assist and demand identification.\" </p> <p>The mayor, Ken Livingstone, said yesterday: \"This looks like harassment of black people by the immigration service and I would like to see it completely stopped. The transport police are there to stop criminal and antisocial behaviour, not cooperate in harassment of black and Asian people by the immigration service.\"</p> <p>Mark Oaten, the home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, has written to David Blunkett, the home secretary, to demand that he review the practice. </p> <p>\"We categorically refute any allegations of racist behaviour by immigration service staff,\" a Home Office spokesman said. \"Trained and experienced officers inevitably apply their judgment in these situations, taking into account a range of factors. </p> <p>\"The alternative is to make officers disregard their experience, existing intelligence and waste a huge amount of time.\" He added: \"It is not anywhere near as simplistic as people catching the tube and just stopping people on the basis of how they sound or their appearance. </p> <p>\"Police are targeting particular areas at particular times based on their own intelligence and analysis of crime patterns, and immigration officers are working with them. The British Transport police are in the lead on this.\" </p> <p>But asked whether officials were stopping passengers on the basis of the language they were speaking, he said: \"Immigration officers will approach people directly if they're displaying certain types of behaviour which they believe indicate that they warrant attention in this context.\" </p> <p>Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the civil rights group Liberty, said the practice was shocking and could even be seen as stalinist. Pointing out that a high proportion of immigration offenders are native English speakers from countries such as Australia, South Africa and New Zealand who have overstayed their visas, he added: \"There are clear racist implications ... It is guaranteed to create resentment.</p> <p>\"I would be very interested to know what the reaction of the London Tourist Board would be. Think of the film clips that could go out around the world showing how London welcomes visitors.\"</p> <p>Keith Best, the chief executive of the Immigration Advisory Service, said the approach was \"going to enrage large numbers of ordinary citizens stopped without any justification whatsoever\".</p>"
