  "<b>If Bush wins...</b> <p>Bush is unlikely to move too quickly if elected for a second term. </p> <p>The initial focus of a second administration will continue to be Iraq. </p> <p>The long-delayed assault by American and Iraqi troops to take Fallujah is widely expected and possibly attacks on other towns, such as Ramadi.</p> <p>Bush has several domestic policy goals that he will move to fulfil. These will include moves to make his first-term tax cuts permanent.</p> <p>Some critics believe that further reform of America's tax code might include taking a look at replacing income tax with a sales tax.</p> <p>The President also wants to press ahead with the semi-privatisation of social security. However, both these plans could be too radical for any second term. Historically, two-term Presidents have been more moderate in their second period in the White House.</p> <p>Also likely to push for another energy bill, which may enrage the environmental lobby again trying to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, after his first attempt failed to make it into law.</p> <p>Has promised to try again to cap damages in medical malpractice suits.</p> <p>Likely to have to make several Supreme Court appointments and may please his conservative base by naming anti-abortion justices, thus paving the way for a second-term challenge to America's abortion laws.</p> <p> <b>If Kerry wins...</b></p> <p>He has sworn to make winning wider international support for the US in Iraq one of his key initial objectives. By the time Kerry takes power, the Iraqi elections will be taking place or have been suspended due to security problems.</p> <p>He has also pledged to bring his health care plan to Congress within 100 days. He has said this will be his first major attempt at new legislation.</p> <p>On taxes, Kerry will revoke the Bush tax cuts for Americans earning more than $200,000 a year. He will keep cuts affecting people earning less than that.</p> <p>He may also engage America in talks to renegotiate some of the terms of the Kyoto environmental pact and wants to set a goal for the US of eventually becoming energy independent.</p> <p>Major legislation is likely to be hampered by the expectation that Republicans will continue to control Congress. In Iraq, events on the ground will likely continue to dictate US military actions, regardless of policy in Washington.</p> <p>He will bring in fresh faces. His priority is to replace attorney-general John Ashcroft with a more moderate figure. He will also try to heal deep divisions, such as the split between the Pentagon and State Department.</p> <p>Kerry is also committed to engaging with the UN. The expected retirement of several Supreme Court judges, means he will almost certainly have to make appointments to America's ultimate legal body. He has said he will not appoint a justice who favours banning abortion.</p> <p> <b>If it is deadlock...</b></p> <p>If the election is close and boils down to a wafer-thin margin in just a handful of states, it could be lawyers who dominate the next 100 days.</p> <p>Mobile 'Swat' teams of legal eagles are ready with private jets to swoop down on any trouble spots.</p> <p>Argument over provisional ballots are likely to dominate any legal challenges. These are being used for the first time by voters whose eligibility is questioned at the polls.</p> <p>The seven states most likely to see disputes are Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Missouri and Illinois.</p> <p>An eighth state, Colorado, is a further wild card as voters there may decide the state should split its nine electoral college votes proportionately between the two candidates. If that proves vital in the national election, a court battle will be inevitable.</p> <p>During any legal fight Bush, as the incumbent, will continue in office with Kerry's team likely to set up its own 'government in exile'.</p> <p>A straight tie in the electoral college would mean that the President will be chosen by the House of Representatives, while his Vice-President is chosen by the Senate.</p> <p>The House is likely to still be Republican controlled, meaning Bush would be selected.</p> <p>Bizarrely, if the Senate fell to the Democrats it could conceivably choose John Edwards as Bush's Vice-President.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter of the week</strong></p> <p><strong> I want a budget trip to the settlement of Ammassalik in Greenland. Can I fly to Reykjavik with Iceland Express, and then book a cheap onward flight and accommodation?</strong><br> B. Richard, London </p> <p>Greenland is hugely pricey, but you're right: it is possible to get there via Iceland. Most tourists visit this part of Greenland, with its Inuit culture and winter sports, on day trips from Reykjavik's domestic airport to Kulusuk with Air Iceland (<a href=\"http://www.icelandair.com\">icelandair.com</a>). They run from the end of May to mid-September, and cost between \u00a3240 and \u00a3320. The trips include a tour of the town and a Greenlandic dance and kayak show. </p> <p>To visit Ammassalik, the price rises to \u00a3625, including a helicopter ride from Kulusuk to Ammassalik and two nights' stay.</p> <p><strong>We are going to St Thomas, in the US Virgin Isles, for two weeks in August. We have accommodation but no flights yet. We'd like information on how to get there and details of places to visit and things to do while we are there.</strong> </p> <p><strong>We hope to go home via New Mexico for a few days so we would welcome information on getting there from St Thomas, as well as recommendations for things to do.</strong><br> Mary Cava, by email</p> <p>A couple of elements make this trip problematic. One is flying during the summer peak season, which will make your ticket expensive.</p> <p>The other is coming back via New Mexico, which will complicate your return journey. In August, a return ticket to St Thomas via Houston with Continental Airlines costs about \u00a3850, with taxes, with Bridge the World (0870 814 4400; <a href=\"http://www.bridgetheworld.com\">bridgetheworld.com</a>). You need to add at least \u00a3200 if you include Albuquerque or Santa Fe on the way back, travelling to Houston and then via Dallas. Cheaper charter flights may be available, so shop around.</p> <p>Once on St Thomas, take your time and explore the island slowly. Charlotte Amalie is a lovely, if heavily touristic town, which attracts 900 cruise ships a year to the Caribbean's finest natural port.</p> <p>If you're feeling active, hire a bike on nearby Water Island, which is rich in military history. There are a few hiking routes, but St Thomas is mostly about lovely beaches, diving and snorkelling.

In Europe we use our own, but further afield we need to hire one. We hear that some countries have an upper-age limit for driving. Please tell us about this.</strong><br> Dorothy Olney, West Sussex </p> <p>This decision is most often taken by car-hire companies, rather than as part of national legislation. While most hire firms don't impose a standard limit, regional franchises may be forced to do so by their insurance companies. Often you simply pay an additional surcharge to cover any extended insurance.</p> <p>Some countries do have an age limit, which varies between 70 and 80 (in Ireland it is 75, for instance). This shouldn't get in the way of your plans.</p> <p>If you must explore by car, contact car-hire companies in advance, depending on where you're heading, and check what their policy is. As long as you have a valid licence and check ahead, you shouldn't have many problems.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>We welcome letters.

  "<p><strong>What influenced you to become an adventurer?</strong><br> My father has a huge love of the mountains and we used to go together when I was younger. That infected me. Skiing was always a big part of it, but I progressed to climbing. He is trying to drive from London to Sydney next year; we're not big beach holiday people. From your book you seem to be something of an accidental explorer. That's pretty close to the truth. I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do and the adventures slowly started taking up most of my life. I was working at a TV company filming people in mountains doing extreme sports. Because I was able to get up there to film them while the other cameramen stayed at the bottom, I swapped sides.</p> <p><strong>Where was your first big trip?</strong><br> Kyrgyzstan in 2000. We found a mountain range that no one had ever claimed and did the first ascent. It was surreal; we named all the mountains. One we called Babushka after the Russian dolls because the range is in the former USSR. That's when I started to think about visiting other great wildernesses and it was inevitable that we would end up in Antarctica, the greatest of them all.</p> <p><strong>When was your first visit to the South Pole?</strong></p> <p>Me, my friend Tom and a guy called Andy skied from the edge of the continent to the South Pole in 2002-03. We were three guys from London with little idea of what we were doing and by all accounts were going to face hell on earth. We got there and we were pleasantly surprised. There were lots of problems and scary things, but it wasn't as bad as we'd imagined. We loved it. And we became the fastest team ever to reach the pole.</p> <p><strong>What does your next trip involve?</strong><br> During Sir Ernest Shackleton's Endeavour expedition, he dreamt of two teams traversing Antarctica from opposite sides and meeting at the pole. Since he tried to do it in 1913, only 10 people have ever crossed Antarctica, so it's not exactly well trodden - I think more people have stood on the Moon. We start tomorrow, going up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. The last guy to go up there was Roald Amundsen, the first person to reach the pole in 1911. Then we're going to make our way to the pole where we'll be met by two 4x4s that will supply us with food and kites. Then we'll kite back along their original route to complete a full traverse. The cars will follow us back. We want to do it in a fast, modern, dynamic way. I think we will be the fastest people to cross Antarctica, but that's not really our aim.</p> <p><strong>How does the kiting work?</strong><br> You're on normal skis but with harder bindings and harder boots explorer' and just get pulled along by these 11-12-metre kites with the sled behind us. The last time we did it in Antarctica it was very dangerous. Every time we wiped out the 80kg sled came up and hit us in the back. We're trying to do 1,000km under sail this time and we're far better prepared. We'll have five different sizes of kite and be wearing body armour.</p> <p><strong>Where next?</strong><br> I think I'll be done with snow and ice for a while. My girlfriend is from South Africa and she's going to be in the 4x4 team, so I think after the expedition we will have earned ourselves a bit of a break and probably go to Cape Town. I've been in cold deserts, but I'd like to explore some of the hot ones now. I used to work on a rhino conservation project in the Namib desert and I'm desperate to get back to that area. My polar gear won't be much use for that, though.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Patrick Woodhead's book Misadventures in a White Desert is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton</p>",
  "<p><strong> Fresh Eire</strong><br> </p> <p> The more rugged and windswept the views from your windows, the cosier you're bound to feel inside. Which must make the Delphi Mountain Resort one of the snuggest places going: the organic-luxury-look hotel is surrounded by Connemara'swild mountains, beaches, rivers and lakes. Huge windows make the most of the views, and the local stone-and-timber building blends in. Admire the rugged vista from the spa, or wrap up warm and go on one of the activity programmes which include kayaking through sea caves, a high-ropes course, abseiling or a cross-country yomp. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> One night's B&amp;B costs from \u00a380pp (00 353 954 2208; <a href=\"http://www.delphiescape.com\">www.delphiescape.com</a>). Flights to Knock cost from \u00a338.86 with Ryanair (0871 246 0000; <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com  \">ryanair.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> Breathe deeply</strong><br> </p> <p> In winter, your yin chi , your gentler, more relaxed 'feminine' energy, needs a boost, so head to the 'hill that breathes', a Tuscan outcrop covered by thousands of pine trees which pour out oxygen and pulse with positive energy. So says the Hibernation Holidays (<a href=\"http://www.thehillthatbreathes.com\">thehillthatbreathes.com</a>) farmhouse retreat 15 minutes from the town of Urbino, a World Heritage Site packed with Renaissance art and espresso bars. The farmhouse is eco-friendly, with a log fire and heated floors, and you can walk in the woods, scoff organic pizza, do yoga, t'ai chi and meditation, then relax with old movies, massages and storytelling. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> A week costs \u00a3450pp including full-board accommodation and holistic activities with Neal's Yard Agency (0870 444 2702; <a href=\"http://www.nealsyardagency.com\">nealsyardagency.com</a>). Flights to Ancona cost from around \u00a340 return with Ryanair (0871 246 0000; <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com  \">ryanair.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> Families in the forest</strong><br> </p> <p> Let it rain outside. There are plenty of wet-weather activities at Center Parcs to stop the family getting cabin fever. The largely indoor centre in Longleat Forest near Warminster is especially good. A 'subtropical swimming paradise' keeps the kids occupied and warm. Grown-ups might prefer Japanese salt-steam baths and Turkish hammams in the Aqua Sana spa. Outdoors, there are cycling and walking trails through the forest of 100-year-old redwoods. You stay in apartments or villas in the forest; splash out on an executive one and get your own sauna and hot tub. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> A four-night midweek break costs from \u00a3237 for a two-bedroom villa, sleeping four, a three bed executive villa is from \u00a3383 (08705 200300; <a href=\"http://www.centerparcs.co.uk\">centerparcs.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Ice as nice</strong><br> </p> <p> Iceland is known for its wonderful weirdness, and the Snaefellsnes peninsula encompasses the country's best. Only two hours from Reykjavik, it's all about stark sea views, glaciers, lava fields and snow-topped mountains. Enjoy it all from the snug Nordic-chic comfort of Hotel Budir (<a href=\"http://www.budir.is\">www.budir.is</a>). Livening up the spectacular views may be a few seals playing on the shore. Work up an appetite for the menus of seafood and game with an exhilarating cross-glacier snowmobile ride, horse riding on the deserted beaches or a stroll through ancient lava fields which, locals believe, are home to leprechauns. If you're lucky, you may see the northern lights between October and March. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> A four-night break including flights, car hire, and two nights each at Hotel Budir and Hotel Borg in Reykjavik, costs from \u00a3518pp with Discover the World (01737 214214; <a href=\"http://www.discover-the-world.co.uk\">discover-the-world.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Bear necessities</strong><br> </p> <p> Like its animal namesake, the Crazy Bear gets hibernation spot-on. The red-brick, ivy-fronted, 13th-century coaching inn has all the oak beams, stone walls and open fires you'd expect from one of England's oldest hotels - over the years it has hosted royalty, politicians and film stars. The restaurant is AA rosette-winning - try twice-baked cheese souffl\u00e9, gnocchi with asparagus and parmesan, or a Sunday roast. Bed down in one of the rooms with four-posters. Outside, Blenheim Palace is on the doorstep, along with Woodstock's antique shops and art galleries. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> Until the end of November, weekend B&amp;B prices are from \u00a385pp per night with Superbreak (0870 701 4444; <a href=\"http://www.superbreak.com\">www.superbreak.com</a>) </p> <p><strong> Cottage ease</strong><br> </p> <p> Couple your cosiness with complete privacy by renting one of the eight Downe Cottages, in Victorian stone farm buildings on the north Devon coast. Some have log-burners; many have big French windows with views over the sea and Lundy Island. Hole up with supplied board games and videos and order in some of Downe's hearty home-cooked bakes. Walk along the South West Coastal Path to the Wreckers' Retreat pub, or pop along to the adjoining spa. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> A Winter Warmer package, including two nights' stay and a spa day (including massage, use of all facilities, lunch and cream tea), costs from \u00a3195pp (01237 441881; <a href=\"http://www.downecottages.com\">www.downecottages.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> Norman wisdom</strong><br> </p> <p> Wooden beams, exposed stonework and toe-warming open fires always up the cosiness factor. Manoir de l'Acherie, a short cross-channel hop away in Normandy, is a country manor house that does all this, as well as award-winning traditional cuisine. With only 14 rooms you won't be overwhelmed by fellow guests, and spacious grounds allow solitary wandering. The manoir is near the market town of Villedieu-les-Po\u00eales - famed for its copperware - from where it's a short scenic drive to the medieval fishing town of Barfleur and Mont-St-Michel. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> A two-night weekend break, half-board, costs from \u00a3147pp with Inntravel, including ferry crossings for car and passengers (01653 617906; <a href=\"http://www.inntravel.co.uk\">www.inntravel.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Laird it up</strong><br> </p> <p> There's no question that the Scottish do cosy well - even in 13th-century castles. And Dalhousie, about 20 minutes' drive south of Edinburgh, ticks all the boxes traditional and modern. Set in riverside wooded parkland, it has 27 bedrooms kitted out in tweed, tartan and twill fabrics, with period furniture and carpets. Scottish-meets-modern-European food is served in the barrel-vaulted dungeon, and the well-stocked library has an open fire and secret bar. Relaxation can be indoors or out - indulge in the hydro spa, or explore Edinburgh. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> Doubles start at \u00a3165 with full Scottish breakfast for two, or from \u00a3125 in the lodge (01875 820153; <a href=\"http://www.vonessen.co.uk\">vonessen.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> By the seaside</strong><br> </p> <p> Snuggle up by the fire in the drawing room of Romney Bay House and watch the waves crash towards the Kent coastline. This secluded sea-front property was built by Portmeirion architect Sir Clough Williams-Ellis for Twenties starlet Hedda Hopper. Ten characterful bedrooms and various public rooms encourage relaxation - put your feet up, play board games and enjoy the legendary cream teas, or play look-out over the Channel through the first-floor telescope. Gourmet dinners come with an excellent reputation. Outside, enjoy blustery beach walks or head for the clapboard houses and artist community of Romney. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> Doubles cost from \u00a380 per night including breakfast; dinner is \u00a335pp (01797 364747). </p> <p><strong> Peak condition</strong><br> </p> <p> Tuck yourself away in a little mountain valley. The Rosa Alpina hotel in south Tyrol has been in the Pizzinini family for more than 60 years, and is a classic. Surrounded by the beautiful peaks of the Dolomites, its views, walking and skiing potential are some of the best. A pair of wooden angels and a crackling fire greet you, and bedrooms combine clean lines and pine with traditional touches. The spa uses natural products (think immunity-boosting hay baths). Four outstanding restaurants include the Michelin-starred St Hubertus. </p> <p> <strong> The deal </strong> Flights to Verona start at \u00a382 return with Ryanair (0871 246 0000; <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">www.ryanair.com</a>). Doubles are from \u00a3120 a night, with breakfast (00 39 0471 849500; <a href=\"http://www.rosalpina.it\">www.rosalpina.it</a>). </p> <p><strong> Lake break</strong><br> </p> <p> Crisp, blue-skied autumn, when the crowds have gone, can be the best time to visit the Lake District. You'll enjoy views over Windermere from your room at the Samling - or even from the outdoor hot tub. Claiming to be a 'hotel in the country' rather than 'country-house hotel', the Samling actually falls somewhere between the two with its sumptuous comfort and informal good service. The 10 rooms come with lots of snug-appeal - some have open fires, and full breakfast in bed comes as standard. Relax in the honour-bar-lounge before a first-rate dinner, and during the day, explore the 18th-century property's 67 acres. </p> <p> <strong> The deal </strong> Doubles cost from \u00a3225 per night, including dinner and full English breakfast (01539 431922; <a href=\"http://www.thesamling.com\">thesamling.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> Swede dreams</strong><br> </p> <p> Rosy cheeks and serious woolly jumpers ... Scandinavians know how to deal with the colder months. And they know how to keep a place toasty. Hire a red-tiled, wooden cottage overlooking B\u00e5vens Lake in east Sweden, and you can embrace the chilly scenes from the warmth of the open fireplace in the large country kitchen, or next to the wood-burning stove in the living room. The energetic can walk by the lovely lake. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> Seven nights' self-catering at the Nyk\u00f6ping cottage costs from \u00a31,159 for a family of four, including return overnight ferry crossings from Newcastle to Gothenburg with en suite cabin (DFDS Seaways, 08705 333111; <a href=\"http://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk\">www.dfdsseaways.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Perfect manors</strong><br> </p> <p> Hide away in some of England's prettiest countryside at the Manor House Hotel near Castle Combe (regularly cited as one of England's prettiest villages). Rooms are in the 14th-century main house, the mews cottages, stables and the coach house - expect lots of four-posters and free-standing baths, underfloor heating, and walk-in showers which drench you from both sides. Acres of parkland makes peace and quiet easy; settle into a leather armchair in the bar and curl up next to a fire, or spot heron down by the river. The award-winning food - modern English made with produce from the house's orchards and kitchen gardens - is served in the stained-glass-windowed restaurant. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> Doubles start at \u00a3180 per night, including breakfast (01249 782206; <a href=\"http://www.exclusivehotels.co.uk\">exclusivehotels</a>). </p> <p><strong> Red-hot and Bruges</strong><br> </p> <p> More get-up-and-go than sit-down-and-chill, cities aren't usually associated with snuggly getaways. Bruges is a rare exception. Much of the town is medieval - cobbled streets, pretty stone guild houses and palaces - giving the place a villagey feel. In the cooler seasons, the crowds disperse and many of the pubs and restaurants have inviting fires. Boat trips and strolls along the canals can be alternated with stops for hot chocolate or mulled wine. Stay in the 15th-century canalside De Orangerie Hotel; it has the full complement of exposed bricks and beams, cosy bars and lounges, and open fires. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> Two nights' B&amp;B starts at \u00a3339pp, with return first-class Eurostar travel (Kirker Holidays, 0870 112 3333; <a href=\"http://www.kirkerholidays.com\">www.kirkerholidays.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> Mill with frills</strong><br> </p> <p> North Norfolk's winding country lanes mean that it takes time to get to Cley - even from the next village - but when you arrive, you couldn't feel more away-from-it-all. Cley Windmill sits at the edge of the county, overlooking saltmarshes and the sea. It's ideal for blustery walks and there's birdwatching at the Holme Dunes Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserve or Salthouse Marshes, where waders stride and brent geese rest in winter. Enjoy great views from the cosy lounge, upstairs observation room or mill-top walkway. Five circular rooms are charming; open fires and home cooking add to the warmth. Nearby, explore Holkham Hall and beach, or try seafood fresh off the boat. </p> <p> <strong> The deal</strong> A night's B&amp;B costs from \u00a338; three-course dinner \u00a317.50 (01263 740209; <a href=\"http://www.cleymill.co.uk\">www.cleymill.co.uk</a>).</p>",
  "<p>For the uninitiated, the best way of describing the London Review of Books, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this week, is that it is to words what Slow Food is to cooking. The LRB, which comes out fortnightly and is to be found nestling between the New Yorker and the Times Literary Supplement in more genteel newsagents, is a long time in the preparing and should not be ingested in a hurry. Yet, in a world so frantic, where information assails us from every quarter in user-friendly, bite-sized pieces, it is a quiet success. Its circulation stands at around 50,000. Not quite Heat, but impressive all the same.</p> <p>In the LRB offices, bookishly close to the British Museum in Bloomsbury, I ask its editor, Mary-Kay Wilmers, if her journal - which is eye-crossingly empty of photographs - comes even close to turning a profit. 'It doesn't exactly not lose money,' she says, with a wry smile. On the other hand, last year, the LRB opened its very own bookshop, just along the road in Bury Place - a decision that, in a market dominated by giants such as Waterstone's and Amazon, looked foolhardy, but turns out to have been a brilliant marketing wheeze. 'Advertising has improved a lot since we opened the shop,' she says. 'Publishers are more aware of us. The bookshop is actually going quite well: that probably will turn a profit. People really like it.'</p> <p>Wilmers joined the LRB at its inception in October 1979, under her predecessor, Karl Miller (the two of them had worked on the Listener). At first an off-shoot of the New York Review of Books, it was born in the Winter of Discontent, when the TLS had ceased to appear owing to strike action. The first issue featured William Empson on A Midsummer Night's Dream, Michael Holroyd on the Webbs, and poems by Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney.</p> <p>Only weeks later, however, and the TLS resurfaced; the New York Review of Books, as Wilmers puts it, 'sloughed off' its British baby. Miller was left to his own devices. This premature abandonment did not seem to trouble him. The first independent issue of the LRB was an even more glittering prospect: Miller wrote on Clive James, Martin Amis on VS Pritchett and Michael Holroyd on Katherine Mansfield. Antony Jay, meanwhile, uncovered the literary sources of Yes, Minister.</p> <p>'It was quite exciting,' says Wilmers, who is also a major shareholder in the business. 'It was a kind of schoolgirl fantasy. You know: we are The Sensitives. Circulation, so far as we admitted, was about 15,000. You'd look at subscriptions, and you couldn't see anyone whose name you knew. Then you'd think: oh, but that's good. I think the paper acquired its identity as it went along. The first one was a bit self-conscious. Then it got better. The first independent issue had a piece in it by Emma Rothschild about Chinese restaurants, and that was really good.'</p> <p>Today, although Miller's stark photographic covers have been replaced by soft watercolours, inside, all is recognisably the same. Pieces are long - 3,000 words, on average - and the race to be 'first' ignored. Reviews often appear at a confusing distance from the publication date of the book in question. This last quirk, however, is perhaps not quite so determinedly lofty as it might seem: 'We're incapable of getting people to deliver on time,' she laughs. 'I'm sure publishers find it completely irritating.'</p> <p>But for all its donnishness, the LRB is not afraid of controversy, even if it attracts it inadvertently. In an issue of October 2001, the paper published the responses of some of its stable of writers - including Tariq Ali and Paul Foot - to the atrocities committed at the World Trade Centre. These responses were, in the round, very varied - but the media, and some readers, noticed only certain sentences, and through a red mist (the ones not wholly supportive, shall we say, of America in her hour of need). 'We got into terrible trouble,' says Wilmers. 'I don't know whether it was whipped up, but we were called monsters and cowards, and we were nervous about a backlash.' Were subscriptions lost as a result? 'We lost a few. We usually lose a few every time we write about Israel-Palestine. But then, we probably gain some, too.'</p> <p>For many readers, the highlight of the year must be Alan Bennett's annual diary, always an LRB exclusive - that, and the personal ads, which are a hoot ('Medication-free after all these years!'). But Wilmers believes that the magazine is at its best when it does the unthinkable, and gives over the whole issue (about 30,000 words) to a single story: Ronan Bennett on the Guildford Four; Andrew O'Hagan on the crisis in farming; Jeremy Harding on immigration. 'I sometimes worry that it's a bit like National Geographic coming into the house,' she says - meaning, I think, that if the single issue doesn't appeal, it slowly gathers dust in a corner. 'But I suppose some people say: \"Phew! I don't have to read the whole thing.\" It lets them off the hook.' Lately, she says, she has run a lot more pieces about foreign policy in general, and Iraq in particular. The 25th anniversary issue includes an unsolicited and brilliantly deadpan 'email from Iraq' by a private security guard: 'Once a week, HQ have a BBQ.'</p> <p>The editors of the LRB celebrated the anniversary last week with a big party, and will also mark it with a series of debates, the second of which - entitled 'Europe: What is the problem?' - takes place on Wednesday. Next week, readers can also buy the second instalment of the anniversary issue, which will include all the pieces that arrived 'too late' for the first: a memoir by Alan Bennett; Andrew O'Hagan on Daisy Goodwin's irredeemably cheesy Poems to Last a Lifetime; and the critic James Wood on Jane Austen. An embarrassment of riches, or so it sounds.</p> <p>Can Wilmers, after 12 years as editor, imagine her life without the LRB? First, she is silent. Then she makes vague, generous noises about a possible successor. Finally, she comes right out with it. 'No, I can't,' she announces, from her corner of the office sofa - which is my cue to let her get back to the great cairns of books among which she looks so entirely at home.</p>",
  "The number of nurses who left the UK to work in America more than doubled last year, prompting concerns of an impending exodus and a deterioration in patient care. <p>There are also fears that the NHS, which has become increasingly reliant on the controversial policy of poaching recruits from developing nations to address its critical shortage of nursing staff, may be struggling to retain its foreign recruits as well as its home-grown professionals.</p> <p>A report published tomorrow will show that a record number of nurses left Britain last year to work abroad, lured by huge pay rises, bonuses and improved living and working conditions.</p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing, which compiled the figures, said it was particularly alarmed about the increase in staff tempted by America's recently launched aggressive recruitment drive.</p> <p>In 2002-03, more than 2,200 verification checks on UK-based nurses were requested by American employers, up from just over 1,000 the previous year. In the past year, US recruiters have embarked on a vigorous campaign to lure nurses from Britain across the Atlantic after a US government report said it needed an additional one million nursing staff over the next decade.</p> <p>The Nursing Times said that American companies were increasing their presence at job fairs in the UK and putting enticing adverts in the professional press. Some recruiters have offered guaranteed jobs to registered nurses who want to move to the States with their families.</p> <p>Packages offer salaries of up to \u00a339,000 a year, two months' rent-free accommodation, air fares, visas for all the family, educational opportunities, a green card working visa and the possibility of citizenship.</p> <p>There is already a critical shortage of some 30,000 nursing staff in Britain. In 2003 more than 8,000 nurses left to work abroad, the highest number in a decade.</p> <p>There are also concerns that the bank of foreign nurses which the UK relies on could also be lured to other countries. Hospitals in Canada and Australia are also suffering staff shortages and have embarked on recruitment drives in the UK.</p> <p>Beverly Malone, general secretary of the RCN, said the increase over one year was striking and, if sustained, could lead to a deterioration in patient care in Britain.</p> <p>'Up until recent years, it's tended to be a one-way street in the UK,' she said. 'Tens of thousands of nurses coming in, but relatively few leaving.</p> <p>'However, we are starting to see a worrying trend. With more than 8,000 nurses now leaving the UK annually, it is going to have a detrimental impact on the stock of nursing staff available.</p> <p>'There are also fears that the US has managed to double the number of nurses it has attracted from Britain in only one year. Last year we were recruiting from overseas with the US. Now they are recruiting from us.'</p> <p>Howard Catton, interim head of policy with the RCN, said Britain was on the brink of becoming a source country rather than a destination one in the global nursing market.</p> <p>'We are highly dependent on internationally recruited nurses - it is not an exaggeration to say that some healthcare organisations would cease to function without them.</p> <p>'But there are fears that these professionals may stay here for a year or two before moving on again to a country that offers better pay and conditions.'</p> <p>Chris Beasley, the government's chief nursing officer, said that steps were being taken to recruit, train and retain more staff.</p>",
  "<p>Coco Chanel, asked to explain the difference between fashion and art, elegantly replied that 'art appreciates in interest and value over time, fashion depreciates.' But art has lately become intensely fashionable. Its current dual status, as sexy but potentially enduring, makes it an immensely valuable tool of communication: cool, but capable of speaking viscerally at deeper levels of meaning. Which is how a group of British artists come to be in Mexico City, putting together a stunning exhibition of installations, video and works on paper.</p> <p>Vast, sprawling and polluted, Mexico is a multi-layered city: ancient, Spanish-colonial, modern. But not, probably, the first place you'd look for a major exhibition of cutting-edge British art. Not where you'd immediately expect to find Martin Boyce from Glasgow, installing his work 'Our Love Is Like the Flowers, the Rain, the Sea and the Hours', with its tree-like structures of fluorescent tubes, screens of metal fencing and shapes recalling half-destroyed park benches, the whole thing reminiscent of a crepuscular public space. Not, either, the first place you'd look for Mark Titchner, the London artist who has explored modernism through wall paintings, banners and billboards.</p> <p>But that would be to reckon without the British Council, which celebrates its 70th anniversary this week, and which has been quietly amassing an impressive collection of modern art for all of that time and showing it around the world. The British Council has sponsored Boyce, Titchner and other British artists to come to the teeming, steaming cacophony of Mexico City. What they achieve here, politically, will not be easily measured: art can only offer a subtle, slow-burn sort of diplomacy. It may be very valuable; we'll almost certainly never know.</p> <p>The British Council's job is to sell Britain around the world by way of culture. This can be an uphill struggle. Recent research by the Council in China, for example, found that among people aged between 25 and 34 who were well educated and had high incomes, only five per cent thought of Britain as a modern country. A British diplomat in Mexico told me that when Mexicans think of Britain, they typically think of beefeaters. As a result, British public diplomacy there is geared to getting across two messages: Britain is hi-tech; and Britain is a modern country.</p> <p>Art may be useful here: no one could argue that British art is not vibrant, intellectually engaged and global in its outlook and ambitions. At the same time, you can't go around telling people what they should find interesting about you. When, three years ago, the British Council approached the Tamayo Museum in Mexico City proposing an exhibition of our art, it was with the idea of sending a major Gilbert and George retrospective. But the Tamayo's director, Ramiro Martinez, didn't want Gilbert and George and he didn't want the YBAs. He wanted to know what was happening in Britain now, and he wanted his museum to be involved in deciding what about that was relevant to Mexico.</p> <p>As a result, the artists who are here installing their works for the opening were jointly selected by Tobias Ostrander, a US-born specialist in Latin American art who works at the Tamayo, and a curator from the British Council, Ann Gallagher. The show they have come up with is not intended to be a summation of where British art is now, even if such a thing were possible; 'rather,' according to Ostrander, 'it's a themed show with British artists.'</p> <p>The theme is the city. Mexico is the biggest city in the world (depending how you measure it) and one of the most dangerous (locals told me the only place riskier was Bogot\u00e1). Some of its inhabitants are off-the-scale rich: Mexicans would be well represented in a list of the wealthiest people in the world. Prices are as high as in London. </p> <p>At the same time, it is also extremely poor. This is the capital of a country whose second-largest source of GDP, after oil, is receipts from nationals working abroad, mainly in low-grade jobs in California.</p> <p>Vast areas of the city are dirt-poor. The infrastructure seems unable to take the strain: visitors are advised not to take taxis because the drivers may be in league with kidnappers. Mexico is a thick soup of cultures, often highly sophisticated; 'a city that's exotic for foreigners, where people are acutely aware of its foreignness,' as Martinez says. But it is also a city that provokes passionate attachment: 'People defend their belonging to the city, in a way like they do in New York.' </p> <p>So the artists selected from Britain, with their works on paper, videos and installations, all have something to say about this - about the sensory experience of the city, its smells, noises, and textures, about our relationship with its modernist ambitions and motifs, and about the emotions engendered by living with its artificiality and gritty realities. The show is to be called Sodium and Asphalt, words that, helpfully, are almost identical in English and Spanish.</p> <p>Twelve British artists are showing, although Oliver Payne and Nick Relph, who work together, should perhaps count as one. Six are in Mexico for the opening (David Batchelor, Kathrin B\u00f6hm, Martin Boyce, Rosalind Nashashibi, Melanie Smith and Mark Titchner); Jim Lambie and his technician have been and gone. Others will come in a few months, when the show moves north, to Monterrey. </p> <p>Tobias Ostrander visited Britain twice, seeing the studios and galleries of artists who interested him, concentrating in the end on London and Glasgow (the Glaswegian art scene is particularly vital at present; four of the selected artists were from the city). </p> <p>Before starting on the project, he knew the work only of a handful of the artists. 'I knew Richard Wright's work, so when I went to Glasgow I made sure I saw him. I'd seen Jim Lambie's work in New York, and also David Batchelor's; I also knew of David Batchelor as an important writer and teacher.' (Batchelor is the author of an influential, and in this context highly relevant, book about colour, Chromophobia.)</p> <p>'In Glasgow we saw Rosalind Nashashibi's video, \"The State of Things\",' Ostrander says. The video features women sorting through old clothes at a jumble sale, and is lingeringly, almost languorously shot. 'We were both drawn to it. That ended up influencing considerably how we thought about the textures of the city - its recycled materials, trash, its slowness.'</p> <p>Ann Gallagher paid reciprocal visits to Mexico City to explore the preoccupations of local artists and identify points of contact. She and Ostrander were in email contact for months, exchanging images and ideas. </p> <p>'Although this is a show about British artists,' Ostrander says, 'it also questions what it means to be British.' Melanie Smith arrived in Mexico City a decade ago and never left: one local critic told me that as far as the Mexicans were concerned, she was only on loan to Britain for this exhibition. Another of the artists, Kathrin B\u00f6hm, is German by birth, although she did postgraduate work at Goldsmiths, lives in Hackney and has an office/studio in Camden. Rosalind Nashashibi, who is based in Glasgow, is half-Palestinian. Nick Relph and Oliver Payne do much of their work in New York. </p> <p>In Albion, one of the best of the small landfill of books and academic papers that has been produced in the last 20 years agonising over what Britain stands for in a globalised, post-Cold War world, Peter Ackroyd argues that 'the power of Anglo-Saxon culture springs in part from absorption and assimilation ... it can be maintained that English art and English literature are formed out of inspired adaptation; like the language, and like the inhabitants of the nation itself, they represent the apotheosis of the mixed style.'</p> <p>One of the most appealing things about the British Council's proselytising on behalf of British culture is its inclusiveness about what our culture might be. When I visited the Council's permanent collection, Andrea Rose, head of visual arts, had told me of her department's eagerness to claim Anish Kapoor for Britain. Kapoor, who arrived in Britain from India at the age of 17, represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1990, a move that kick-started his career; he has maintained a warm relationship with the Council ever since, and donated works to the collection.</p> <p>Only a couple of elements in Sodium and Asphalt are from the British Council's permanent collection: a couple of glittery turntables by Jim Lambie, made from his usual recycled, junk-shop materials, alluding to the club scene in Glasgow, where Lambie was a band member and DJ; and a work on paper by Richard Wright '(not titled 31.3.04)', a faux-wood surface, beautiful in the way of meticulously executed original work, and yet representing something entirely cheap and fake. </p> <p>If Ostrander and Gallagher hadn't wanted so much that was site-specific, they could have put together any number of exhibitions from the permanent collection. The Council mounts an average of 60 shows a year, featuring 4,000 works. A couple of weeks before going out to Mexico, I'd visited the warehouse round the back of a bus garage in Acton, west London, where its store of treasures is housed, to see how the operation works.</p> <p>No sooner was I through the door than I came face to face with a vast yellow and primary-hued piece, 'Diana As An Engine' by Eduardo Paolozzi, which was just back from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tehran and Pakistan. Round the corner I almost tripped over a dizzying Bridget Riley; hanging on the wall beside it was an Antony Gormley sculpture, a huge nude with outstretched arms. </p> <p>I spotted a Grayson Perry pot on a table and a Tracey Emin blanket, which someone said offhandedly was 'probably going to Colombia'.</p> <p>It was all very odd: tucked under the Tube line where it peters out into west London was one of the most extraordinary and least-known collections of modern and contemporary art in this country - 8,000 works, representing every significant artist of the past 60 years, from Henry Moore to Damien Hirst, Lucian Freud to Rachel Whiteread, Bridget Riley to Sarah Lucas. The collection is quintessentially British, but only 10 per cent is ever in this country at any one time. Its role is to be out on the road, in Tehran and Turkmenistan, Bangalore and Mumbai, Bogot\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo.</p> <p>Co-curated exhibitions such as Sodium and Asphalt are not the norm, although increasingly, many shows involve some reciprocal local involvement - so, for example, a design exhibition that has been touring India this year and is due to travel to Australia early in 2005 has acquired a tour 'appendix' from every country or region visited, exploring the exchange of design ideas to and from the host area and other cultures. Featured artists often give lectures and host workshops: Richard Deacon, Bill Woodrow and Anthony Caro all flew out to a show of 20th-century British Sculpture in Iran this spring and met young Iranian artists, while Michel Muller of the Henry Moore Foundation ran a bronze conservation workshop and Tim Marlow, director of White Cube, and Tate Britain's director Stephen Deuchar both gave lectures.</p> <p>The operation is all the more impressive given the limitations of the British Council's budgets: in practice, there is roughly \u00a3100,000 a year available (out of a total grant of \u00a32.2m) to buy new work. This requires that the Council buys cleverly, mainly when artists are young and their influence unproven. One reason the acquisitions policy is so successful is that the Council has a very high-powered advisory committee. Currently chaired by the director of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, this includes the directors of the National Gallery, Tate Britain, the V&amp;A, the Whitechapel, the Hayward, the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, the Liverpool Biennial and the Henry Moore Foundation, plus one art critic (Richard Dorment at present) and one artist (currently Richard Wentworth, who also happens to be Master of the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at Oxford). It meets twice a year, but is feeding through information and insights all the time.</p> <p>The Council doesn't buy speculatively; it acquires works because of their fit for a particular set of projects. Andrea Rose shows me a recent acquisition by Toby Ziegler: a huge, hi-tech piece that's almost mystically reflective. It was purchased with a view to touring the Middle East, currently a high priority, but where figurative work can be seen as anti-Islamic and the sex-and-scatology content of some contemporary art can be a problem. It will form part of a New Abstraction show, for which it may take two years to assemble the right pieces. Obviously it would be easier and cheaper to borrow, and the Council will happily do so. But much of the work sitting in the warehouse on the day that I visit (including a new Damien Hirst, 'Resurrection', featuring a human skeleton) has just come back from Tehran. When the Iran exhibition was first being discussed, so was war in Iraq. The places that the British Council most wants to go are precisely those that the owners of much-loved, fabulously expensive artworks are least likely to want to risk sending them for months on end.</p> <p>In the warehouse, I see the first work the British Council's visual arts department ever acquired: a chocolate-boxy painting of a farmhouse, by Duncan Grant, a bucolic idyll of a certain kind of Britain. This inward-looking nation is not the one that the Council wants to promote any more. Its activities are much better summed up by its decision to send Sam Taylor-Wood to St Petersburg this winter to premiere two new videos; or indeed, by its eagerness to work with a Mexican curator on exploring common preoccupations in Latin American and British urban centres.</p> <p>'The foreign office sets the geopolitical agenda - the mission to younger audiences, East rather than West, the Islamic world and China. Editorially, we are independent,' says Andrea Rose. 'When we went to Iran earlier this year there was a definite sense on the part of people we were meeting and talking to of, \"Why aren't we part of the rest of the world?\" We can use this collection far more subversively than people realise.' </p> <p>In Mexico City, a pollution smog hangs over the city, obscuring the surrounding mountains: the altitude-thin air is thick with fumes and the press of people. It's the day before the opening. But the Tamayo Museum is air-conditioned and peaceful in the way of big, concrete modernist spaces, and the artists are managing to remain fairly calm, despite last-minute hitches. 'There's a very different energy in Britain now from the YBAs,' says Ostrander; 'especially the Glasgow scene: it's much more relaxed. There's far less ego: a really generous attitude.' The artists who have come out for the opening are distinguished by a thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness: one of the strongest themes in the show is a powerful, shared critique of formal abstraction. But they are also friendly, unprecious and easy-going.</p> <p>Kathrin B\u00f6hm is still sticking bits of paper to the gallery walls. Her work is part of an ongoing project called 'and millions and millions', which involves her pasting cut-up pieces of hand-printed and offset posters on the wall in a collage of flat, coloured, geometric shapes, often layered on top of each other. She works slowly, cutting out shapes, tacking them up with tape, on different parts of the wall and even different walls at the same time. The process is hypnotic, and confusing - why has she built up so much over there and nothing over here? It looks as if she will never be ready. </p> <p>Martin Boyce has spent the last few days installing his half-lit urban park, to which I keep returning, because in spite of its evocation of a vandalised space, I find it mysteriously inviting. But one of his three fluorescent tube-trees is too bright. Since Mexican dimmer switches won't work, another has had to be sent from Britain. Unfortunately, Mexican customs are holding it to ransom and want $150 for its release. Mark Titchner's giant billboard went up more easily than he expected A maelstrom of colour and patterning, it makes reference to computer punchcards, to the way that utopian and radical ideas are seized by the market, by advertising and hype, and reduced to banal slogans. The effect is compelling, resonant with colour and life. Unfortunately, it is also too long for the wall, which isn't straight. Obviously, he doesn't want to cut the end off, but neither does he want it hanging off the wall.</p> <p>Melanie Smith's piece involves a series of paintings in bright synthetic colours, using airbrush techniques, to produce linear optical effects recalling the work of Bridget Riley. She has stacked these against the gallery wall, and shows them in conjunction with five videos (the monitors resting on cardboard boxes): images of Mexico's streets, alluding to the sensation of groundlessness experienced in the city. She has been into the gallery and turned up the sound so that it's aggravatingly loud.</p> <p>Richard Wright isn't here, but he's sent a set of posters that he wants flyposted around the city, in addition to the works he is showing inside. Tobias Ostrander has the posters spread out in front of him on Jim Lambie's reverberating gaffer-tape floor. The posters are beautiful and I'm not surprised when Ostrander tells me a set is worth about $15,000. </p> <p>He's talking to someone who flyposts for Mexican wrestling about where to put them. 'They'll be photographed. And then they'll probably be damaged. But that's good. That's what he wants.'</p> <p>Richard Gough, the technician who is here to oversee the unpacking and installation, takes me out to the back of the museum, where the British Council's trademark powder-blue packing cases are stacked (the Tate uses yellow cases; the National Gallery dark green) and talks about his work with nerdy enthusiasm: 'This case was made for a Rachel Whiteread exhibition seven months ago. It's been to S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio.' Like several of the other British Council technicians, Gough was trained as a fine artist. He has reason to be proud of his packing: Diana Eccles, who is in charge of the collection, told me that nothing had been broken in 70 years of constant shuttling around the globe. The objects and paintings being transported are often terrifyingly valuable, uninsurable other than by government indemnity. 'If we did break something,' says Eccles, 'we'd probably go out of business.'</p> <p>The works for Mexico, or the materials required to make them, were wrapped in acid-free tissue, hermetically sealed in polythene, padded around with inert foam (to prevent vapours) and carefully packed in blue boxes to be air freighted. Swaddled and sealed like this, they are safe from cold, heat, humidity and vibration. They must be unpacked in the presence of someone from the British Council, and the contents and precise disposition of each layer noted, so that they can be packed up again in exactly the same fashion. </p> <p>Eventually, the dimmer switch is released. The gallery's lighting is fine-tuned so that it doesn't bleed into the wrong spaces. Melanie Smith's volume is turned down. The last pictures are secured on the wall and the fixings painted over. (They are lower, Ann Gallagher notes, than in Britain, because people in Mexico are shorter; in Germany pictures are hung higher.) The Tamayo technicians manage to build an extra bit of wall behind Mark Titchner's overhanging billboard. Kathrin B\u00f6hm stops, apparently randomly. She puts out posters for people to take, so they can try it at home. The floors are swept for the 20th time, tea lights are placed all round the walls of the foyer. Everything is more or less ready for the opening.</p> <p>The target audience is the usual one for the Tamayo; the director of the British Council in Mexico makes the point that he's not running a development agency, so his target market is not the inhabitants of the city's slums. It's key decision makers, such as the Minister of Culture; then advisers and the press; and thirdly, young people who themselves aspire to be decision makers, and who may also be interested in studying in Britain, since the Prime Minister has pledged himself to increasing the number of foreign students at British universities.</p> <p>Everyone is pleased, because the Minister of Culture turns up, and she doesn't usually bother with openings. A leading Mexican critic talks to me approvingly about bridging the cultures, about pop influences, references to the grid of the city and the poetry of its patterns. The British ambassador tells me that the Mexicans and the British share a sense of humour and predilection for not taking ourselves too seriously. The embassy, she adds, is working with the Mexican government on reform of the civil service and of the judiciary. With a nod to the customised nature of this show, she says, 'They like working with us, because we don't say: \"Here's one we made earlier.\"'</p> <p>One critic tells me he can't find enough political statement, and was expecting something 'more crude and direct'. But on the whole there's an atmosphere of goodwill. The leading critic, Cuauhtemoc Medina, says he's intrigued by the 'rather peculiar, not easily explicable dialogue between Mexico City and London'. (At the time of Sodium and Asphalt, six Mexican artists are exhibiting in different venues in Britain.) This dialogue is curious, he adds, given that Britain wasn't the colonial power, isn't the real power now, and there's no large immigrant population. In common with the British ambassador, he thinks it must have something to do with sensibility, 'with sense of humour and directness'.</p> <p>Nicholas Serota, who sat on the advisory board of the visual arts department for 30 years, once claimed the British Council offered a Rolls-Royce service. Andrea Rose prefers to think of it as a Land Rover service: 'I like to think that, like the World Service, we're there when everyone else is asleep.' The Council goes into places that are often tough and inhospitable, with its James Bond mission to show what we're capable of, in all our diversity and heterogeneity, our eclectic, adaptive pragmatism.</p> <p>It is impossible to measure what might be the effect of sending the work of a dozen British artists to Mexico, either now or in the future. But it seems only common sense for artists to share their intellectual and emotional insights. Like the World Service, the British Council's visual arts department isn't susceptible to the current obsession with targets, but one senses, nevertheless, that it's an institution about which we can probably allow ourselves to feel proud. The UK - four countries with an uncertain commitment to being a nation - seems particularly troubled by the legacy of its past and its part in the global future. It is a paradox that a nation so uncertain about its place in the modern world does propaganda for its place in the modern world really rather well.</p>",
  "<p>Casinos are a dream vehicle for the money launderer with dirty notes to put into the system. Money goes in and out of casinos with such speed and in such quantities that regulators struggle to track it efficiently. That is why the law places great reporting burdens on companies that operate casinos. </p> <p>Casinos are treated as financial institutions in much the same way as banks and are subject to money laundering regulations contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The owners of casinos are likewise subject to scrutiny and their anti-money laundering procedures must comply with defined reporting procedures. </p> <p>Casino reporting and regulatory systems, even when they are well implemented, are regarded by the law enforcement community as vulnerable to abuse. The prospect of the creation of additional and larger casinos fills police with dread. One concluded: 'The present proposals are bound to add to London's laundering risk. The scheme is barking mad.' </p> <p>One risk is the system's vulnerability to abuse by an outsider. In 1998, four employees working at three casinos in Nevada were charged with laundering $400,000 for undercover agents whom they believed to be drug traffickers. </p> <p>Money laundering through casinos started with the drug, hooch and mafia barons in the United States in the Twenties and Thirties. They set up gambling dens in offshore centres like Cuba and the Bahamas to hide their dirty money from the authorities' gaze. These off-shore locations might today be the chosen bases for online casinos, as local regulation is minimal. </p> <p>Many casinos today are very reluctant to accept cash and anyone who seeks to buy their chips with large quantities of cash is likely to be the subject of a report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Like banks, casinos must make a report on anyone seeking to spend \u00a310,000 worth of cash or more. </p> <p>But many casinos will require a punter to use a credit card to pay for his chips. That allows the casino to identify the user, as well as the source of his cash. 'Casinos have bought into the \"know your customer\" regime applied to banks,' said one investigator. 'The days when they were laundromats for dirty cash have gone.' Casinos are also required to register large cash payouts to protect them against a money launderer falsely claiming he won dirty money at a casino. </p> <p>The grand buildings in central London or the provincial leisure and shopping facilities planned by the government offer little money laundering risk. The real worry today is the abuse of online casinos. Control in cyberspace is minimal and the scope for abuse great. </p> <p>One investigator told of a drugs baron who lived the life of Reilly in the West Indies. His bank account was in his home town and he wanted to pull together in a single account the profits from his drugs business, which were scattered around the world. </p> <p>His solution was dangerously simple. He set up an online casino based on his West Indies island. He then gave each of his operatives a credit card and told them to gamble away a fixed sum on his casino. Their losses were clearly the casino's gain, and he deposited them at the local bank. The mafioso paid the credit card bills with his dirty money, so ensuring both the transfer of the earnings to his account, and the removal of some compromising cash. </p> <p>'Online casinos are ready-made for money laundering,' says Michael Adlem, the managing director of Protivity, the UK risk consultancy. 'This criminal activity relies on the use of credit cards, and the only way it can be stopped is if Visa and Mastercard are excluded from the gambling arena. That would kill online laundering stone dead, but the credit card firms would resist it fiercely. For them, it is a money machine.' </p> <p>'Due diligence of online gambling is not as stringent as it is in other financing institutions,' says Frank Yu of Hong Kong's Ion Global. 'The online gambling site can be properly legitimate. But many fail in performing the due diligence of finding out who they are accepting money from and who they are giving money to.' Similar concern was expressed by Rick McDonnell, the head of the Asia Pacific Group money laundering division, a part of the Financial Action Task Force. 'Internet gambling is a vulnerable area. It is a risk.' </p> <p>One scam of casino owners engaged in money laundering is to doctor high-payout slot machines. They have been known to use sophisticated technology to override the machine's random system, using a 'back door'. They then arrange for someone who is part of the plot to make a big win. The 'winner' has not had to supply the casino with personal details, as he would have to do if he were a conventional gambler, and the money is taken without the casino making a report.</p>",
  "<p>Six years ago, I conducted a series of interviews with John Peel at Radio 1 and in the wine bar nearby. It wasn't difficult work: I turned on the tape-recorder and sat back, and after 10 minutes of mild suspicion and Rioja he hit a groove of sad and funny stories that brought tears to his eyes and mine, and all I could do was hope the batteries were fresh. </p> <p>My memory of him is of a hugely sensitive man who cared very much about his music and his family, but also about how he was regarded by others. A magazine interview he had recently given had been very harsh on him, questioning whether he genuinely liked most of the records he played, and Peel had been terribly hurt by it. Looking back, it is significant how often in our conversations he considered his standing among his peers, and how much he relished his reputation as a pariah within the corporation. This was a role he found useful to foster, but in truth he was a shy and quiet man, prone to internalising his anger. And he was immensely loyal; he knew that he could only function in public service broadcasting, and in time he became its best advertisement. </p> <p>I had first met him 18 years earlier, when he provided the narration for a radio documentary I had written. I told him how thrilled I was to hear him voice my script, and was astonished when he replied that he was genuinely happy to have the extra work. The extent of his talents was not fully exploited until Home Truths many years later. His impact on so many lives has not been fully measured until the past week. </p> <p>His producer and great friend John Walters, who Peel was convinced would deliver the eulogy at his funeral but died three years before him, had warned me that many of Peel's stories were embellished, and he could prove that some of them couldn't possibly be true. Peel often told him that his grandfather used to get champagne on the National Health. Walters questioned him on this, and Peel always said, 'Yes, champagne.' Eventually, the story changed. 'Oh, I asked my mum, and I muddled it up,' Peel conceded one day. 'It wasn't champagne. It was morphine.' </p> <p>Peel told me that his domestic life had recently been 'complicated'. His beloved wife Sheila had a made a good recovery from her brain haemorrhage, an event he found 'unimaginably terrifying', but her eyesight had deteriorated. In addition, her mother had recently died, and her father had moved in, and their children were in various stages of leaving home. Throughout these turmoils, there was one reliable comfort. He said that everything 'seems to be all right again when I come in and start mispronouncing the names of songs'. </p> <p>Here are my own favourite Peel stories from those tapes.</p> <p>On discovering Elvis:</p> <p>'I'm a great believer in getting your priorities wrong, setting your sights low, so that you don't go through your whole life frustrated that you never became prime minister. </p> <p>As a young lad, I used to listen to the American Forces Network in Europe, coming out of Stuttgart, and to Radio Luxembourg, and the signals were always satisfyingly feeble, so that you really felt you were participating in something quite exceptional. The record that genuinely changed my life was on Two-Way Family Favourites on the BBC. It may be hard now to understand how frustrating it was to listen to the radio then, because you could often sit and listen to a programme for several hours and not hear a single record that you liked. You'd listen to things like Housewives' Choice in the morning - based on the premise, shared by Radio 1 when it started, that housewives were some sort of subnormal minority group, as if perfectly sensible women would walk down the aisle but then return as gibbering idiots. </p> <p>Two-Way Family Favourites was a show that reunited our boys overseas with their families back home on a Sunday lunchtime. One afternoon I heard them say, 'Lance Bombardier Higgins has requested the first record by the new American singing sensation Elvis Presley.' On came Elvis, and it sounds idiotic to say it now, but at the time 'Heartbreak Hotel' was just a revelation, like being transported immediately to another planet. The only thing that came close was when I heard Little Richard a few weeks later. It was genuinely frightening, as if something had been unleashed on the world that would never go back in the bottle. It turned out to be the case, wonderfully. </p> <p>The quest for perfection:</p> <p>'I lived in the States for seven years in the Sixties. In the days before we knew about sexism, me and a couple of mates used to follow the fortunes of a young woman who performed under the name of Chris Colt, the Girl with the 45s. We used to follow her from grisly strip joint to grisly strip joint. I was driving back from a particularly exhilarating performance in New Orleans, having left my friends down there, and I was crossing what they call the Piney Woods of East Texas, which cover an area the size of Belgium, as all big woods invariably do. I was driving along this long road in the middle of the night, and the moon was at the far end, so it was like driving along a silver ribbon, if you want to be poetic about it, and the hills were rising and falling, and there was a small town before me, and on the radio came a record by Elmore James called 'Stranger Blues'. The first two lines were, 'I'm a stranger here/I just drove in your town.' I just thought it was a perfect conjuncture of time, place and music. You always hope in the course of doing a programme that somebody somewhere may experience a moment like that.' </p> <p>Heroin in his hair: </p> <p>'I used to run a record label, catastrophically unsuccessful, called Dandelion, named after a hamster - that's how things were in the late Sixties. We put out about 30 LPs using other people's money. There were one or two I quite like to listen to, and one or two atrocities. Stackwaddy were fantastic. They had an album called Bugger Off , which Annie Nightingale used to play a lot. They were punks before there were punks - these very primitive lads from Manchester who played a rather violent and inaccurate r'n'b. Once we got a person over from the States to see a whole load of Dandelion bands at a college in London. We made the mistake of putting Stackwaddy on first. The singer was a deserter from the army, and wore this improbable wig all the time. They turned the treble up on all their equipment, so it was like listening to a kind of buzzsaw. The singer was very drunk, and the first thing he did at the start of the gig was just walk to the edge of the stage and piss on the students. </p> <p>When Radio 1 started, it was generally regarded as rather unhealthy for presenters to show any interest in music, as it was believed this would lay us open to unscrupulous promotions people offering fast cars and women. Of course these things never happened, but you did have to keep your interest in music very much to yourself. In earlier days there were times when senior management at Radio 1 seemed to be rather surprised that I walked upright and used knives and forks. I never saw my programmes as all that radical - more an alternative to what was on at other times of the day. But at one time I was regarded within the corridors of the BBC as being the Baader-Meinhof Gang of British broadcasting, and treated with a certain amount of terror. </p> <p>It used to be that we had a controller, name of Muggeridge, who was joint controller of Radio 1 and 2, quite a good idea. When the BBC was looking for a man to do this job, they quite naturally chose someone who until that time had been head of the Chinese section of the BBC World Service. Once he had got the job he interviewed various DJs one after another, and I was last in. I think he thought I would do something unpredictable and startling, like rub heroin into the roots of his hair. He was sitting at his enormous desk, a sort of Dr Strangelove position. At some point in the conversation I mentioned public schools, and he brightened up a little at this idea, as if at some stage in my life I had actually met somebody who had been to a public school. </p> <p>I said, 'Actually, I went to one myself.' </p> <p>He went, 'Extraordinary! Which one?' He was assuming it was some minor public school somewhere on the south coast. I said, 'Shrewsbury.' He said, 'Good heavens!' At this stage he was getting quite elated. 'Which house were you in?' I told him and he said, 'How's old Brookie?' </p> <p>It was clear that he thought, whatever he looks like, and whatever sort of unspeakable music he plays on the radio, he is still one of us. I think for a long time it was this factor that sustained me at the BBC.'</p> <p>The bloody awful rubbish: </p> <p>'At Radio 1 I try to keep myself to myself. I've always thought that avoiding office politics was a rather shrewd thing to do. I feel a bit like a person who lives in a cottage while a new estate is being built around him - so long as I can tend to my bees, I'm perfectly happy. I don't socialise that much with people here. I occasionally go to the pub or the wine bar with some of the women, because obviously they don't see me as a threat. I'm not likely to try to get off with them. </p> <p>I do still see the Radio 1 thing as being what I do. Radio 4 is still seen as being the senior service, so when a couple of impeccably middle-class women call up and ask me to do a programme I'm always hugely flattered. You go off to very low-key places like Coventry to interview a family who have 19 children, and you think, 'Oh no', but then you meet them and you come away quite heartened by it all. Sometimes, if you're a regular reader of the newspapers and watch TV news programmes, you can whip yourself up into a froth of despair. So going out and finding that not everybody wants to kill you is kind of reassuring. </p> <p>In 30 years there has genuinely never been an attempt by management to exert any control over my programmes, not beyond the occasional comment like, 'Ah, John, you still playing that bloody awful rubbish?' Someone from management did come down when I was playing a lot of hip hop, and then later when I was playing jungle, to inform me that I shouldn't be playing this music, because it was the music of the black criminal classes. </p> <p>I think I was a handy safety valve for some time. If someone called up to complain about the safe and predictable nature of the station's playlist, someone could always tell them, 'You can always listen to John Peel. He plays strange discs.' </p> <p>Tony Blackburn goes Barry Manilow:</p> <p>'As a Radio 1 DJ, you were expected to do ludicrous things. We had these Radio 1 Fun Weeks, which usually consisted of travelling the country with a bunch of other DJs, and Noel Edmonds filling people's hotel rooms with chickens. In more enlightened days than ours you'd be burnt at the stake for doing that. People like Mike Read and DLT would often complain that they couldn't go anywhere without being recognised, but of course would go everywhere in a tartan suit carrying a guitar, so they would have attracted attention in a lunatic asylum. </p> <p>But these things did have compensations. Perhaps the best moment for me took place in a multistorey hotel in Birmingham, in something called the Dickens Bar, lots of dark-wood booths full of people who no doubt travelled around the country selling Dickens Bars to other hotels. Tony Blackburn got up with Paul Williams, a Radio 1 producer who used to play the piano tolerably well, and sang for about half an hour. There was massive indifference to his efforts, if not downright hostility, yet he went through the whole thing as if he was Barry Manilow at the Copacabana, as if everyone was absolutely adoring everything he did. He soared in my estimation after that. I thought, 'He's not such a tosser after all.' </p> <p>A particularly viscous tackle:</p> <p>'Occasionally, I'd be invited to these rather serious BBC events at TV Centre. I used to dread these things, but you had to go. Quite often I was the only person from Radio 1 who was invited, probably because I had been to public school. Once I found myself sitting across the table from the Two Ronnies and thinking, 'What do I say to these bastards?' </p> <p>On another occasion, I had just recorded Desert Island Discs , so I went along with Sue Lawley. When we sat down I was at a table which included Nicholas Witchell, PD James and Jonathan Powell. I turned to the bloke sitting next to me and said, 'Hello, I'm John Peel.' And he said, 'I'm John Birt, and actually we were introduced five minutes ago outside.' You don't really recover from that. After about an hour of non-conversation, I said to him something about football, and he said, 'Didn't you break your wrist playing five-a-side in Holborn about 10 years ago?' I said, 'How did you know that?' He said, 'I was the bloke that tackled you.' </p> <p>People say I 'discovered' or 'made' certain bands, but I never really think of it like that. I don't have a series of notches on my bedpost. They discovered themselves really, or some record company or manager did, and what I did was what I'm paid to do - play their records on the radio. I didn't discover The Undertones or Joy Division - they made magnificent records and I played them because I loved them. The fact that most other people were not playing them is the thing, but you'd have to ask them why that was. I think I helped listeners discover the bands, and if one more person has the chance to see Misty In Roots because they heard them on one of my shows, then I'm happy about that. </p> <p>I don't tend to mix with bands. I'm too shy or respectful, and I don't think I would know what to say. I don't know very much about their history. Also, there's that thing about not wanting to lower my admiration of them, which I might do if I met them, and I feel they'd certainly have a lower impression of me.'</p> <p> How to make the perfect radio show: </p> <p>'A lot of people working [at Radio 1], young people, come up to me and make rather un-British little speeches about how they grew up listening to my programme, which is lovely to hear, and then you can think to yourself, 'Well, perhaps you wouldn't even be working here if it wasn't for me,' and I quite like the thought of that. But even the younger ones stopped listening to the programme at some stage. It seems that people listen to the programme for a while and then stop, and often listen to the programme later on in their lives. I get letters from people who say, 'I hadn't listened to your programme for 12 years, and I was driving home the other night and heard something I thought was fantastic. I've listened every night since, and it was just how it used to be.' </p> <p>Sometimes kids write in and say, 'I was listening to your programme in my bedroom the other night when I was doing my homework, and my mum came in and said, \"What are you listening to?\" I said, \"John Peel,\" and she said, \"Oh, I used to listen to him when I was your age.\"' It's nice being woven into people's lives in that way. </p> <p>I always compare a good programme to surfing, not that I ever surf. When a programme goes well, you do feel you're riding along on the crest of something. You go out of the studio at the end and say, 'Wow, what a great programme!' and they say, 'Oh, it sounded like all the others to me.' But some nights you can come away feeling so desperate because you've made so many mistakes, and you go out and say, 'That was just a disaster.' And people say, 'Oh, it sounded just like all the others to me.' </p> <p>I listen to bands' demo tapes almost exclusively in the car in the two-hour drive home. The ones I don't like get thrown on the floor in the passenger's area and by the end of the week they swill about. The ones I do like get thrown over my shoulder into the back seat, and then harvested at the end of the week. I know that I'm going to die trying to read the name of some band in the headlights of a car behind me, and then drive into a truck in front. People will say, 'Oh, this is the way he would have wanted to go.'</p>",
  "<p>For a moment forget about the charge sheet against Messrs Bush and Blair - the alleged lies about WMD or the illegality of the invasion of Iraq - and glance at the bigger picture. Global terrorism, global poverty and global warming form a toxic trio that promise a catastrophe that will make the horrors of 9/11 look like the Boston Tea Party.</p> <p>Do I exaggerate? In the Middle East untold thousands of Arabs are being slaughtered by US warplanes and artillery, supported by the British, to impose Western democracy on Iraq at the point of a gun. In Beirut, once dismembered by civil war but now at ease with itself, the young parade through the squares with grace and elegance. But listen to what they say and you discover a coruscating sense of humiliation and a deepening rage against America, startling in this most genuinely Westernised Arab state.</p> <p>Aliya Saidi, a young lecturer at the American University, was discomfited to be asked about Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld: 'I don't want to say I hate them but they are terrible people.' After an embarrassed pause, she added: 'I don't know if I should say that; my husband is American.'</p> <p>The resentment against the US administration (not the American people who are pre sumed to have been duped) crosses all classes and backgrounds. 'If the US continues to despise the Arab nation in this way,' the owner of a sportswear shop, Hadi Baalbaki, warns, 'I fear the whole Arab nation will form itself into one big al-Qaeda.'</p> <p>Richard Clark, Bush's former anti-terrorism coordinator who took charge in the White House on 9/11 and who retains close contact with intelligence agencies around the world, tells me that 'by almost any measure... the war on terrorism is being lost'. He cites the rate of terrorist atrocities, more than doubled since 9/11, and insists that the number of terrorists has risen to around 100,000 active 'jihadists' around the world. Chillingly, he believes these zealots are likely to be supported 'philosophically, politically, and perhaps with money' by upwards of 700 million Muslims - roughly half the global population of the Islamic faithful.</p> <p>When I was first in Lebanon, some 30 years ago, the young Palestinians in the refugee camps were taught how to use Kalashnikovs. Now, two generations on and still without any escape from their humiliation, they live in an emotional swamp of resentment and anger. Ahmad Iskandar is in his early twenties, edu cated and courteous and speaks as if explaining the self-evident to a backward pupil: 'I am ready to explode myself in Israel.' Ready to be a suicide bomber? 'It is not suicide, sorry. It is a martyr operation.' And what about the innocents who will die? 'Our heart is now dead. They make us forget everything. Just to go and kill them.' And he shrugs his shoulders.</p> <p>Already the poison of al-Qaeda is seeping into the Palestinian camps. Munir Maqhdar, a refugee, is holed up in south Lebanon where he leads a small band of gun-toting guerrillas who swagger around him as he says 'anybody who supports the killing of Arabs and Muslim people in Afghanistan and Iraq is a legitimate target. Any Arab or Muslim organisation is entitled to take revenge if the opportunity arises... the White House has to demonstrate that the historic injustice perpetrated against Palestinians matters every bit as much as the protection of the state of Israel.' According to the UN, 60 million Arabs live on less than two dollars a day, the population is growing rapidly, and unemployment is set to double in five years. The finance director of the Central Bank of Lebanon, Youssef el-Khalil, says that young people have a choice between corruption or fundamentalism. 'Fundamentalism is very much seen as the alternative to corruption... the war on terrorism has to address the war on poverty.'</p> <p>The neocons who hold sway in Washington do not flinch under this kind of fire. For them, in the words of Richard Perle: 'We are winning the war on terrorism. We have killed a significant number. We have put terrorists in many parts of the world on the defensive.'</p> <p>Try telling that to the two doctors I met in Ethiopia, who told me of impoverished young Muslims in the south-east of Ethiopia who 'are being indoctrinated under the coverage of religion with the beliefs and attitudes of al-Qaeda' and who, in some cases, are already in training for future operations. Try telling it to the American diplomat in Addis Ababa who gave me an 'off the record' briefing, holed up in the US compound which, like US embassies around the world, is protected from terrorist attack by armed guards, concrete barriers and razor-wire. He showed me a list of 'wahabi' clerics and business leaders in Ethiopia suspected of allegiance to al-Qaeda and volunteered that US special forces are now operating alongside Ethiopian soldiers in an effort to break up al-Qaeda cells in the Ogaden region. And how were they doing? He shrugged: 'We have already lost the war against terrorism in Africa.'</p> <p>Try telling the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, that 'we' are winning the war on terror. 'Yes,' he confirms (for the first time), US forces are indeed engaged in military operations alongside their Ethiopian counterparts but this 'police work' is only part of the solution - 'the most important part is fighting poverty'. This is not so much an issue of morality but of urgent necessity in a country stricken by familiar but excruciating indices of misery. 'There is a very frustrated population that sees no light at the end of the tunnel and therefore is susceptible to all sorts of saviours, false saviours,' he says.</p> <p>Ethiopia's 70 million population divides its religious affiliations almost equally between the Orthodox Church and Islam. Traditionally this has not been a cause of strife and inter-marriage is commonplace. But you now hear rage against America on the streets of Addis Ababa just as in Baghdad or Beirut. Meles is a member of Tony Blair's Commission for Africa though he has no illusions about its potential to deliver salvation. But in a continent where thousands of children die every day from preventable diseases and where (despite the ravages of HIV) more than 300 million live on less than a dollar a day, you are bound to grasp any outstretched arm and twist it to your advantage.</p> <p>As it is the grotesque distortions of the global market mean that for every dollar the West dispatches to Africa in the form of aid, two dollars are clawed back through subsidies and tariff barriers: a monumental rip-off by the rich as they instruct the poor to accept 'free' trade or else.</p> <p>A growing number of Africans, especially the young (mostly unemployed), use radio, television and the internet to keep themselves disconcertingly well-informed. The hypocrisies and injustices that are inflicted on them drives Meles Zanawi to warn that Africa, no less than the Middle East, could become the source of tomorrow's 9/11. 'Whether it is people in the rural areas of Ethiopia or the centre of Manhattan, we are in the same boat,' he comments, echoing outgoing European commissioner Chris Patten, who says, 'sometimes people are very angry, when they think that fairness is denied them until the crack of doom'.</p> <p>The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, tells me 'it is not that someone who is poor immediately becomes a terrorist... but what are the children going to do, young people with similar values to our own, can't get a job and are frustrated in everything they try to do?'</p> <p>As it is, the West can't even find the resolve to meet its UN 'Millennium Goals' - to reduce world poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. According to Wolfensohn and Gordon Brown, this target date, at the present rate of progress, will be overshot by more than 100 years. There is no excuse: as the Chancellor tells me in great frustration, 'What is lacking is the political will'.</p> <p>It can be done. If every Western nation were to contribute 0.7 per cent of GDP to overseas aid, write off the debt of poorest countries, and eliminate agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, they could find in the order of $785 billion dollars annually for development aid - more than 12 times the present commitment.</p> <p>Which takes us - or should take us - from global poverty to global warming. It is the greatest challenge facing humanity, to combat both at once - to deliver justice, fairness and prosperity to the poor without destroying the planet in the process. Already we are consuming the Earth's natural but finite resources faster than they can be replenished. Already Britain's chief scientific advisor, Sir David King, tells us global warming is a greater threat than global terrorism.</p> <p>So what happens when the poor have their just deserts? Will we see the melting of the ice-caps, catastrophic floods that drown hundreds of thousands of people and turn millions into refugees and famished migrants? Will we all perish in some Siberian or Saharan Armageddon? Or find ourselves caught in a Malthusian end-game as we perish for lack of food and water? Or will we start to control our profligate use of carbon fuels and persuade whoever wins the American election that the resources of the planet must be more equitably shared?</p> <p>As with winning the war on poverty, so with global warming: it is a matter of political will. Which is why a deeply frustrated president of the World Bank says: 'If someone came here from Mars and looked at the way we run the place, he'd get back in his spaceship and go back to Mars and say, \"You don't have to worry about them, they are going to destroy themselves\".' Which means, as I argue in The New World War , we had better get serious about global terrorism, global poverty, and global warming.

  "For Feriba Ahmadi, the morning when deportation officers came is seared in her memory. Clad in riot gear, they rammed their way into the Ghausia Jamia mosque at Stourbridge in the West Midlands, where she and her family were taking refuge. <p>For the Ahmadis, who had fled Afghanistan after being targeted by the Taliban, it was the start of a new nightmare that would see them deported to yet another strange country where they would struggle to eke out an uncertain existence below the poverty line.</p> <p>'It was 6am and my husband, Farid, and I were fast asleep,' Feriba says, barely able to hold back her tears. 'I woke up to what sounded like bombs going off and for a second I thought I was back in Afghanistan. I was totally confused because I knew I was in a place of sanctity.'</p> <p>Seconds later, in full view of a media scrum, the couple were seized and imprisoned in Handsworth, Birmingham, while friends they had made in their adopted community looked after their children, son Seear and daughter Hadia, then aged four and six.</p> <p>Locked alone in her prison room, Feriba watched news reports of their eviction. 'The government wanted to use us as a symbol, and send a message to the world that they were tough on asylum seekers. Even my poor mother, who was dying of cancer in Kabul, saw us in the newspapers. She thought we had escaped the fighting in Afghanistan to find peace in England.'</p> <p>Feriba, 26, burns with rage at how they were treated. 'We had brains, hearts and souls and all we wanted was to work and settle down in England. Instead of getting compassion, we were made out to be liars and treated like serial killers.'</p> <p>The Ahmadis were deported to Germany in August 2002. There they believed they would gain immediate rights to settle, but are still required to renew their residency permits every six months and live in a barren, soulless detention centre.</p> <p>'We have no security, no friends, no life,' says Feriba, who has been diagnosed as medically depressed.</p> <p>Home is a camp for asylum seekers on the outskirts of Landsberg, in Bavaria, where the family shares a bedroom separated from a poky kitchen and bathroom by a long, dark public corridor. On display are photos of happier times: a wedding picture, two beaming schoolgirls - one an English blonde and the other a dark-haired Afghan.</p> <p>The living room door clicks open and a girl with two thick plaits and large saucer eyes peeks in.</p> <p>Feriba feigns a smile for her daughter. Hadia plonks herself next to her mother. In fluent German - she has equally mastered English - she says she misses her friend Rosi, the bubbly blonde girl in the photograph. 'We used to play together, but now she's just my pen pal.' Abruptly, she disappears into the bedroom.</p> <p>Six-year-old Seear is rummaging through a cardboard box full of toys - a Buzz Lightyear, a Batman model, cars and plastic animals, hand-me-downs from English friends. He springs over to his mother, drinks the dregs of her cold cardamom coffee and slips off to find his sister. Feriba whispers: 'Hadia and Seear are very sad. They have no friends and feel so isolated. My son's favourite teacher in England was an Indian woman called Mrs Jasmine. Even now, he always tells me to put on my Indian dress so I look like her.'</p> <p>The nostalgia in Feriba's voice turns bitter as she recalls when she discovered her family had lost its appeal against deportation to Germany.</p> <p>The blow was delivered on Christmas Eve 2002 as a suicidal Feriba lay in a hospital bed. Although the High Court ruled there had been a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the raid on the mosque 'was proportionate to the aim of exercising an effective immigration control'.</p> <p>She says the family escaped Afghanistan after their home was bombed and Farid, 36, had been tortured by the Taliban. Her husband takes over from his now blubbering wife: 'Feriba was pregnant and we had been to visit her father. When we returned, our house was a pile of rubble. The Taliban came asking for money. They wrapped telephone cables around my big toes and gave me electric shocks.'</p> <p>He leaves the room quietly. 'It's Ramadan and my husband must pray now,' Feriba explains. She has been pre scribed anti-depressants and is too weak to fast.</p> <p>The Ahmadis say they fled Afghanistan in 2000 with visas and passports, but their paperwork and money were stolen soon after they arrived in Germany from Ukraine.</p> <p>'We were left with nothing and nowhere to turn. I was crying in the street when a policeman took us to a camp for asylum seekers. Ten months later, we all got into the back of a lorry and ended up in England.'</p> <p>They were dispersed to Lye, in Stourbridge, where they lived on a housing estate for a year. Despite campaigns to Downing Street and a 1,000-signature petition to keep them in England, the family was deported.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Landsberg office for asylum seekers said the family had been granted permission to stay until February 2005. He added that the arrangement would remain in place until German ministers met to assess the political situation in war-torn countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>Farid earns \u20ac400 (\u00a3277) a month in a factory, and Feriba has completed a six-month intensive German course and two months' volunteer work at a hospital.</p> <p>'It has been one nightmare after another,' she says.</p>",
  "<p>Nicole Kidman is perhaps unique in Hollywood. She has the sort of untouchable star quality patented in the 1930s by Carole Lombard and Norma Shearer, the physique of a Norman Parkinson model, and the artistic aspirations of Anna Magnani or Lotte Lenya. She can wear a prosthetic nose, get raped in a Brechtian set or kiss a 10-year-old boy on the lips, and she will still be on the cover of Vogue . </p> <p>In person, she is quite remarkably beautiful. An erstwhile freckled redhead, Kidman is now of a single creamy hue, from her flawless face to her vanilla hair, which has been swept back and made to tumble, as though carelessly, past her shoulders. She is so long, and so lean, that she seems almost to be a trick of perspective. When I meet her, she is draped over an anonymous hotel sofa in a paper-thin designer pea-coat and knee-length skirt, her middle as concave as a Fifties mannequin's, her glossy legs stretching endlessly out towards crocodile heels. </p> <p>Kidman has gone, in recent years, from playing the infanticidal mother in The Others to playing a suicidal Virginia Woolf in The Hours , from a brutalised slave in Dogville to a love-haunted widow in her new film, Birth . Is there something about the damaged qualities of these characters that appeals to her? </p> <p>'Ah, I don't know,' she sighs, closing her eyes and stroking her forehead with the palm of her hand. (When I saw her do this in Eyes Wide Shut, I thought it was overacting. Now I see that it comes naturally.) 'I don't know,' she repeats, 'I suppose I run away from too much analysis. I certainly don't go and choose damaged people. They're people I respond to, at this stage.' </p> <p>As you might expect of an Australian who has spent the last 14 years in Los Angeles, her voice has a soft antipodean lilt, with slightly Americanised vowels. Onscreen, she's as good at playing English women as she is at playing Americans, and her natural accent is somewhere between the two - her own, but distinctly unemphatic, with an evenness that suggests it may be lying fallow, in anticipation of the next cinematic incarnation. </p> <p>The directors she's worked with routinely comment on her flexibility. Stephen Daldry, who directed her in The Hours , has referred to her as 'a transforming actress'. Jonathan Glazer, who directed Birth , has gone so far as to call her 'malleable', as if she were nothing without a director's modelling hand. Kidman responds by telling me she thinks 'cinema is a director's medium, so you're saying, \"What do you want?\" Being an actor is about adapting - physically and emotionally,' she adds. 'If that means you have to look great for it and they can make you look great, then thank you. And if you have to have everything washed away, then I'm willing to do that too.' </p> <p>What some might call flexible, others might call erratic - a risk Kidman takes with her unpredictable choices. But at her best, Kidman is a blonde cut out for Hitchcock. She can be haunted, in an aristocratic, everyday sort of way, the kind of haunting that never interferes with one's chignon but shows, for that very reason, the way the surface of things can crack. In The Others , she plays a very proper wife and mother trying to hold it together against such terrible odds she doesn't realise she's already lost it. In Birth she is a well-off 35-year-old in mourning, an emotion that becomes more crazed as time wears on. The film was booed at the Venice Film Festival, for a scene in which Kidman and a little boy who claims to be her reincarnated husband share a bath. But the movie is not about sex, it's about the figments of one's most tortured imagination, and in that sense it also owes a great deal to Hitchcock. Like James Stewart in Vertigo , Kidman is not really in love with the person before her, she is in love with the person he represents. 'This is a film about love,' Kidman says now. 'What is a great love? Is there a love of our life? Do you ever recover from the loss of somebody that was so important to you?' </p> <p> <strong> NICOLE KIDMAN</strong> met Tom Cruise on the set of Days of Thunder , a Tony Scott film about stock car racing in which they were co-stars. She had grown up in Sydney (though she was born in Hawaii) and had been acting in TV series since the age of 16. The Australian thriller Dead Calm brought her international attention in 1989, and she made Days of Thunder in Hollywood in 1990. Within a year, she and Cruise were married; she was 22. </p> <p>Kidman has always been very close to her family; her father is a biochemist and a clinical psychologist, and her mother is a nurse who was active in the women's movement. She and her sister Antonia were brought up as Catholics, under her mother's motto: 'Don't let anyone break your spirit.' When she got married, she tells me, that was what was most important to her. She and Cruise adopted two babies - Isabella and Connor, now 12 and 10 - and she put her career second. Then she met Stanley Kubrick. </p> <p>'He taught me to believe in myself artistically,' she says. 'I spent my twenties raising my children, and wanting to, and being married. That was my driving force. And then he said to me, \"No, you have to respect your talent, and give it some space, and give it some time.\" Which was a lovely thing to be given. And my children were a little older then.' </p> <p>Kidman has said that working with Kubrick on Eyes Wide Shut - a land mark film, his last, and the only film since their first in which Kidman and Cruise co-starred, 'resonated through our lives and marriage. Stanley breaks you down.' Now she says that in the roles she took on after her divorce - two of which have been Oscar-nominated, one of which won, 'Suddenly I was able to have the time to put some of the things that were going on inside me_' and then thinks better of continuing. She eventually responds on a practical level. 'It was by chance that The Hours came along. Was I in a place where I could say, I'm going to go to England and make this? Yes. Could I do that earlier, when I was married? No, I couldn't travel like that. We had a thing where we couldn't be separated for more than two weeks. So that made a lot of work just not possible. Which was fine by me.' </p> <p>She pauses, and croaks a little. 'I'm going to need some water,' she says. </p> <p>For better or worse, Kidman's reputation in the gossip columns has varied as many times as her choice of roles. She has gone from being seen as a star's appendage in 1990 (when Tom Cruise was thought to have 'made her') to being famous as an Oscar-winning triumph in 2003 (when Tom Cruise was thought to have held her back). In between, she has been an ice queen (after To Die For ), a vulnerable victim (after her divorce), and a girl about town. She has been linked with practically every co-star anyone could think of, plus Lenny Kravitz. </p> <p>Glazer thinks she 'seems to find a role that speaks to her at different times in her life', though he adds that, 'Some of the roles she's chosen are more honest than others.' When he cast her in Birth , his favourite of her performances was as the murderously ambitious TV star Suzanne Stone Maretto in To Die For . 'You're not anyone in America unless you're on TV,' her character affirms, before hatching a plot that would make Machiavelli wince. Kidman had been married to Tom Cruise for five years by then. It wasn't her first Hollywood film, but it was her breakthrough, a complicated part she played with manipulative gusto, and which she felt she was 'destined' for. 'I guess,' Glazer reflects, 'in a funny way that's who she was then.' </p> <p>'I've been through a lot in my life,' Kidman often says, and tells me she believes that the best performances 'come from your experiences, and the things you've been through and so therefore you're more willing to expose yourself. As you get older you have more to give.' </p> <p>'The thing to understand,' says David Hare, who wrote The Blue Room and the screenplay for The Hours , 'is that she's intensely practical. She deliberately chooses roles or undertakings which involve an autodidactic element - \"I'll learn about Virginia Woolf, I'll learn how to act on stage, I'll learn to sing\". She likes anything which involves acquiring new skills and knowledge.' In order to play Woolf, she learned to write right-handed. She took up smoking for The Human Stain , learnt Russian for Birthday Girl and the cello for her forthcoming Sydney Pollack movie, The Interpreter . </p> <p>Does she think she's hard on herself? </p> <p>'Yeah,' she says. 'Hard on myself in the sense that_ when I'm lying on my death bed, I wanna have some peace.' Where does that instinct come from? I ask. 'God knows,' she laughs, 'A lot of religion as a child, and a strong, strong, strong imagination that can sometimes be_' - she trails off - 'dominating.' </p> <p> <strong> KIDMAN LIKES </strong> to write. She writes short stories, some of which she hopes to publish one day, and she likes to read - the poetry of Anne Carson, an erudite, experimental writer, and Philip Larkin. 'I have a great respect for words, and the meaning of words, and the way in which we have to be very careful_ um, with what we say.' Writing, she says, 'is something that helps to keep me together'. </p> <p>From time to time, Kidman will imply some kind of intimate intricacy, then shake her head with a half-smile and a miniature exhalation, as if it were all about to be too much. One doesn't expect revelations from her - the cover story in the current Harper's Bazaar features, by way of intensely personal detail, the fact that she enjoys the smell of fresh flowers - but given her frequently haunted screen presence, you can't help but imagine a hint of torment. Jonathan Glazer, who says he didn't get to know Kidman all that well during the filming of Birth , despite finding her gregarious and 'bubbly', suggests that, 'She's very hard to read - and there's something fascinating about watching that, trying to decode someone. There's a complexity there, and a very powerful inner life going on.' David Hare tells me that, 'Anyone who knows anything at all is very protective of her for all the obvious reasons.' </p> <p>'It's all going to fall apart,' she has been saying recently, and 'it won't last much longer'. What does she mean? 'I don't know,' she breathes, and looks at the floor. 'I act, I don't know how I do it, and I'm not sure if I can keep doing it. You know, you're never sure whether it's going to be there again.' </p> <p>Is she superstitious? 'I have moments where I've said, don't tread on that crack in the pavement, don't have a black cat walk in front of you. Deep down am I superstitious? No. Do I believe in trying to be as kind as possible and as compassionate as possible because ultimately you're alone with yourself and your own conscience, and you want that to be as clear as possible? That's not superstition. You have to just try and stay pure and know what you value.' </p> <p>'And what do you value?' </p> <p>'I think the connections with the people in my life.' </p> <p>A PR, who I now realise has been standing behind me throughout the interview, leans in and tells me I have a minute left. Randomly, I ask Kidman what's the maddest thing about her family. She laughs. 'My dad tap dances!' Then she thinks again. 'My kids aren't that mad - within a mad, mad world they're pretty together. I'm working hard on it. But we're all pretty mad.' She smiles. 'Beautifully mad, I would hope.'</p>"
