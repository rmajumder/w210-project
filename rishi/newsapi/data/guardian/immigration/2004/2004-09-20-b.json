  "<p> It will be a long time gone, 20 months at least, but the memory of the last big event at the old Ascot racecourse should endure for a good deal longer than that. No less than 22 horses were declared yesterday for the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over a mile on Saturday, and almost a third of those are winners at the highest level already. </p> <p>With four of those being Classic winners either this season or last, and other performers of Group One level including Norse Dancer, Diamond Green and Antonius Pius among the possible runners, it was no surprise that Coral felt obliged yesterday to ease Soviet Song, the ante-post favourite for the race. </p> <p>From 2-1, James Fanshawe's filly is now 3-1 and the overall strength of the field is such that Attraction, the brilliant winner of the 1,000 Guineas in May, can be backed at 10-1 with Coral. Newmarket's other Guineas winner, Haafhd, is only a point shorter at 9-1 with Ladbrokes, while Refuse To Bend, who won the same Classic last season, is 7-1 with Coral. </p> <p>There is even a dark horse to add spice to the mix in the shape of Aidan O'Brien's Ace, a three-year-old son of Danehill who made a successful racecourse debut in June and has won both his races since. O'Brien is still looking for his first Group One win in Britain this season, but he nominated the QEII as Ace's next assignment as soon as he won a Group Three at Leopardstown last month, and such is the respect for any runner from Ballydoyle that he is as short as 10-1 with Hill's. </p> <p>Even by the considerable standards of the QEII, this renewal appears exceptional. The winner will surely be acknowledged as the best miler in Europe, and quite possibly the finest at any distance. The bookmakers cannot be faulted, though, in making Soviet Song their favourite for the race. </p> <p>\"Soviet Song has come out of her win in the Matron Stakes [in Ireland, beating Attraction] in very good order,\" James Fanshawe, the filly's trainer, said yesterday. \"The aim has always been to go for this race, and the only reason she wouldn't go to Ascot would be if I wasn't happy with her closer to the date. </p> <p>\"It looks a tough field, but she has done everything right in her last three races, and ran very well when she was second in the Queen Anne [over the straight mile at Ascot]. </p> <p>\"The only thing you have to hope for with so many runners, especially going around the bend at Ascot, is that you'll have some luck in running.\" </p> <p>The seven-strong contingent of Group One winners in Saturday's entries is completed by Rakti, who won the Prince of Wales's Stakes in June, Bachelor Duke, who took the Irish 2,000 Guineas in May, and Le Vei Dei Colori who, like last year's winner Falbrav, is a winner at the top level in Italy. </p> <p>The stop after Ascot in the autumn cycle of championship races is Longchamp the following weekend, when North Light, the Derby winner, seems increasingly likely to start favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. </p> <p>Sir Michael Stoute's colt has not seen a racecourse since his second to Grey Swallow in the Irish Derby in June, but he will make the short trip to the Rowley Mile in Newmarket this afternoon to gallop between the second and third races on the card. He is expected to work over nine furlongs, and an acceptable display will fuel the gamble that has seen him backed down to 4-1 favourite for the Arc with Ladbrokes.</p>",
  "<b> Boston Globe </b> <br> Editorial, September 17 <p>\"It should not be surprising that a classified National Intelligence Estimate completed late last month projects three scenarios for Iraq over the next year and a half that range from dicey to disastrous - from fragile stability to civil war among Sunni Arabs, Shias, and Kurds. What is surprising is that President George Bush and Dick Cheney, the vice president ... go on campaigning on the false pretence that their Iraq policy has been a success ... The suicide bombs, roadside bombs, ambushes, kidnappings, and assassinations - all these assaults on Iraqis and foreigners show a nation in violent disorder. This continuing mayhem, which casts doubt on the possibility of holding elections ... in January 2005, also casts light on the unmistakable failures of the Bush administration's efforts at peacemaking and nation-building in postwar Iraq.\" </p> <p><b> Musa Keilani </b><br> Jordan Times, September 19</p> <p> \"One did not need the 'secret and confidential' US intelligence report projecting a bleak future for Iraq, with a civil war not being ruled out, to realise that things are going wrong wholesale for Washington in Iraq ...

We know that, as every day passes, the US is making more enemies in Iraq than friends ... </p> <p>\"What the Iraqis need now is stability and security first, and democracy later.

We believed the president was right to confront the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and like the vast majority of Iraqis, we welcomed the removal of that murderous regime. Yet even before the war it seemed to us that Mr Bush was failing to recognise, or prepare for, the fact that the postwar reconstruction of Iraq would be long, difficult and dangerous ... Too often American soldiers and commanders have been flung into the breach between illusion and reality. Many have responded with great courage ... but more than 1,000 have died, thousands more as well have paid a terrible cost and no end to these losses is in sight ...

  "The tale of how I became a Nazi and my Nazi harasser became a Jew is as intriguing as it is instructive. Last November I wrote a column about a racist email sent to me by an employee of an insurance company and my frustrations over the manner in which my grievance was handled. The man in question (a white, South African supporter of the British National party who complained of \"undesirables flooding into Britain\") was subsequently fired. His dismissal was not as a result of my column but because my original complaint had alerted the company to a previously unreported pattern of racist behaviour on his part. <p>Of the numerous responses from the public I received, most were supportive but many were more abusive than the original message. One stood out. Incensed that something as \"trivial\" as racist abuse could lead to a man losing his job, one reader compared me to the person who betrayed Anne Frank. And so, through contorted metaphor and contemptuous logic, the harasser became the victim and the harassed was transformed into the perpetrator. </p> <p>Victimhood is a powerful, yet contradictory, force. Powerful because, once claimed, it can provide the moral basis for redress, retaliation and even revenge in order to right any given wrong - real or imagined. The defence of everything from the death penalty to affirmative action, Serbian nationalism to equality legislation, are all underpinned, to some degree, by the notion of victimhood. Contradictory because, in order to harness that power, one must first admit weakness. Victims, by their very nature, have less power than their persecutors: victimhood is a passive state - the result of bad things happening to people who are unable to prevent it. </p> <p>In the past, the right has exploited this tension to render victimhood a dirty word - a label synonymous with whingers, whiners, failures and fantasists. Revealing no empathy with the powerless nor any grasp of historical context, they wilfully ignore the potential for victimhood to morph into resistance, preferring instead to lampoon it as a loser's charter. </p> <p>\"The left had become little more than a meeting place for balkanised groups of discontents, all bent on extracting their quota of public shame and their slice of the entitlement pie,\" wrote columnist Norah Vincent three years ago. \"All of them blaming their personal failures on their race, their sex, their sexual orientation, their disability, their socioeconomic status and a million other things.\" </p> <p>Such arguments were always flawed. But increasingly they are beginning to look downright farcical. For if you are looking for someone making political hay out of victimhood nowadays, look no further than the right. The ones most ready, willing and able to turn the manipulation of pain into an art form have found their home among the world's most powerful. </p> <p>Read the Daily Mail and you would believe that Britain is under threat from the most impoverished and vulnerable people in the land. Asylum seekers, immigrants, \"welfare cheats\" and single mothers are bringing the nation to its knees. While the country is going to the dogs, the Christians are, apparently, heading for the lions. \"We, as a people, and the government, must make strenuous efforts to promote and defend our culture, and especially the place of Christianity in it and the rights to self-expression by Christians,\" wrote Simon Heffer earlier this year. </p> <p>Across the Atlantic, the right's new role as victims is even more prevalent and pronounced. Straight relationships are threatened by the prospect of gay marriage, white workers are threatened by affirmative action, American workers are threatened by third world labourers, America is threatened by everybody. </p> <p>At times, this means the powerful appropriating the icons, tropes and rhetoric of the powerless in their entirety, to hilarious - if disturbing - effect. Last year Roy Moore, the former Republican chief justice of Alabama, led a failed bid to keep a monument of the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. Standing before a group of supporters, some of whom were waving Confederate flags, emblem of the slave-holding South, he said: \"If the 'rule of law' means to do everything a judge tells you to do, we would still have slavery in this country.\" Wearing T-shirts proclaiming \"Islam is a lie, homosexuality is a sin, abortion is murder\", they then sang We Shall Overcome. </p> <p>In these cases, victimhood serves merely as a pretext for a backlash to reassert, extend or expand the dominance of the powerful. If these people are victims of anything, it is of the threat to their entitlement and privilege. </p> <p>In others, however, genuine suffering acts as a precursor to genuine vindictiveness. The threat of suicide bombings in Israel serves as the rationale for building the wall to protect Israelis from terrorist attack. In the current intifada, the Israelis have lost more citizens than during the six-day war - no one should belittle their pain. Palestinians, on the other hand, have lost about three times as many people due to Israeli military aggression. Who, one wonders, needs protecting from whom - or is some people's pain more valuable than others'? </p> <p>But nowhere is the abuse of victimhood more blatant than in the US presidential election, where September 11 remains the central plank of the Republicans' strategy for re-election. The fact that their campaign begins with the terror attacks is not only understandable but also, arguably, right - this is the most significant thing to happen in the US since Bush assumed office. </p> <p>The trouble is that the campaign's message ends with that day also. September 11 has served not as a starting point from which to better understand the world but as an excuse not to understand it at all. It is a reference point that brooks no argument and needs no logic. No weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? \"The next time, the smoking gun could be a mushroom cloud?\" No United Nations authority? \"We will never again wait for permission to defend our country.\" No link between Saddam and al-Qaida? \"They only have to be right once. We have to be right every time.\" </p> <p>This is the real link between Iraq and 9/11 - the rhetorical dissembling that renders victimhood not a point from which they might identify with and connect to the rest of humanity but a means to turn their back on humanity. They portray America's pain as a result of 9/11 not only as unique in its expression but also superior in its intensity. </p> <p>When 3,000 people died on September 11, Le Monde declared: \"We are all Americans now.\" Around 12,000 civilians have died in Iraq since the beginning of the war, yet one waits in vain for anyone to declare that we have all become Iraqis, or Afghans, let alone Palestinians. This is not a competition. Sadly, there are enough victims to go around. Sadder still, if the US continues on its present path, there will be many more. Demanding a monopoly on the right to feel and to inflict pain simply inverts victimhood's regular contradiction - the Bush administration displays material strength and moral weakness. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@gurdian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer experienced poor summer trading and is expected to announce terms for its \u00a32.3bn tender offer substantially below the 400p per share that billionaire Philip Green was prepared to pay to take over the ailing retailer two months ago. </p> <p>In a sales update tomorrow, accompanying the tender details, the 300-strong M&amp;S chain is likely to reveal that its sales of womenswear and childrenswear continued to underperform over the summer season. Food sales are also understood to have been poor. </p> <p>The new M&amp;S trading downturn will contrast sharply with the performance of its competitors. Last week, its fashion rival Next unveiled bumper sales and profits while John Lewis pinpointed women's fashion as one of its best-performing departments. </p> <p>The Waitrose supermarket business, part of John Lewis and M&amp;S's chief rival for upmarket food, announced healthy growth in like-for-like sales of more than 3% on last year. Tesco, which unveils first-half results tomorrow, is also expected to put M&amp;S's performance in the shade. </p> <p>The new M&amp;S management will argue that the goods in the stores were the responsibility of the previous management, which was ousted when Mr Green made his bid intentions clear at the end of May. Stuart Rose, the new chief executive, has said it will be a year before his team's influence can been seen in the shops. </p> <p>The details of the tender - equal to nearly 30% of the chain's \u00a38bn stock market capitalisation - will be thrashed out tonight at a meeting of M&amp;S and its advisers at Cazenove, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Cazenove will process the tender offer. </p> <p>The price range will be announced tomorrow morning but is expected to be about 350p to 380p. M&amp;S shares are changing hands at 350p. The price will depend on investor response, but even at its top end will be markedly short of the price shareholders could have raised had they been able to accept Mr Green's offer. </p> <p>M&amp;S will argue that the price offered is \"not a price for control\" and that shareholders have the option to sell some, all or none of their shares. Long-term investors will benefit from the resultant increase in earnings per share. The tender may also be used by hedge funds that built a stake during the takeover speculation and want a way out. </p> <p>If the M&amp;S offer is spurned, the store will still press ahead with the return of capital, one of the planks of the M&amp;S defence strategy along with a renewed focus on older shoppers and the disposal of the M&amp;S credit card business. </p> <p>In that case it will either wade into the market to buy the shares, pay a special dividend or issue B shares. The preferred route, which M&amp;S has taken before, would probably be to issue B shares.</p>",

  "<p>The Liberal Democrats are ready to lose votes rather than trade on asylum policy as a \"cheap way \" to boost poll ratings, the party's home affairs spokesman said today.</p> <p>Mark Oaten took to his party's conference floor to lambast the \"faustian pact\" made by both the government and the Tory party over asylum seekers as a way to boost their popularity at the expense of fuelling \"an atmosphere where hatred of asylum seekers is commonplace\".</p> <p>As he reiterated Lib Dem policy on asylum and immigration unveiled last week, Mr Oaten told delegates that the party would never stoop so low to win votes.</p> <p>\"Many of these people have been through persecution and abuse - and this is how we treat them; with a total lack of respect,\" he said. \"Let me tell you this, conference - and I don't care if it loses votes to say it - Liberal Democrats will not use asylum seekers as a cheap way to boost poll ratings.\"</p> <p>Dubbing the home secretary, David Blunkett, a \"repeat offender\" on asylum, Mr Oaten set out plans to remove day-to-day responsibility for asylum from the home secretary to curb political interference from the issue.</p> <p>Asylum seekers would also be allowed to work and access employment services within eight weeks of their application, in a bid to reduce their dependence on benefits, he said.</p> <p>Delegates backed his proposals to set an annual quota for the number of migrant workers from outside the EU to be allowed into the country. </p> <p>Under Lib Dem policy, an independent panel - including representatives of the Confederation of British Industry, trade unions and the public and private sectors - would set the quota after gathering evidence on skill shortages in different sectors of the economy.</p>",
  "First let me say it has been a great privilege to lead the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords for the last three years. I have had wonderful colleagues. Liberal Democrat Peers work incredibly hard. They know what they are talking about. They dominate question times and debates by the sheer quality of their contributions. <p>On a wide range of Home Office bills, they have championed trial by jury, civil liberties, decent treatment of asylum seekers, improving prison conditions, and effective action against racial and gender discrimination. They have fought for a more democratic House of Lords and have rejected half-baked reforms. They have presented a powerful case against the illegal invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent failure to respect in some instances the lives and liberties of Iraq's civilians. They have fought against tuition fees, argued for better pensions, massively improved bills on housing, planning and regional government. I am incredibly proud of them; and their achievements deserve far more publicity than they have got.</p> <p>So, the cat is now out of the bag. The suspicion that we as Liberal Democrats were troubled by from February of last year, that the Iraq war was illegal, has now been confirmed by the Secretary-General of the UN Kofi Annan himself.</p> <p>It is no use Patricia Hewitt in her most dulcet tones saying that she disagrees with Mr. Annan. She is a Minister in a Government deeply implicated in the invasion of Iraq. He is the most senior official of the world organization, a man of wisdom and caution, widely respected by the international community. Whose judgement is the rest of the world likely to respect?</p> <p>The Government wants to move on from Iraq. It does not want to dwell on failure. So much so that the Prime Minister is willing to talk to the T.U.C.!</p> <p>He claims he's back to \"issues concerning hard-working families\". </p> <p>But we cannot move on so easily. This war in Iraq is our war, committed in all our names. Hard-working families across the country are implicated by the decisions made on their behalf. In the name of the United Nations, the rule of law, the battle against terrorism, Britain invaded Iraq.</p> <p>Twelve hundred brave servicemen and women, and between twelve and fifteen thousand Iraqi civilians, including babies and children, are now dead.</p> <p>Today Iraq is lawless and slipping into chaos. Foreign contractors, like foreign soldiers, are immune from Iraqi law. Senator Chuck Hagel, a leading Republican, last week described the dearth of proper spending on reconstruction as \"beyond pitiful\". And experts agree that the terrorist menace has grown, not declined, and that terrorist groups now operate freely in Iraq, where previously there had been no link.</p> <p>The Government cannot move on until it admits to this - the greatest diplomatic blunder since Suez - and learns lessons from it. One of those lessons is how weak Britain's influence has been over the American administration. Even the Road Map for Israel and Palestine, so strongly urged by the Prime Minister, is now a sour joke. The settlements go on growing, the building of the Wall in Palestinian territory goes unchallenged by the American Government. </p> <p>Meanwhile, we have taken our eye off the ball on terrorism. The CIA has fewer experienced staff working on Osama bin Laden than in September 2001! We neglected the War on Terror for a War on Iraq - a war of our choosing. The consequences of that choice are emerging every day.</p> <p>At home, Liberal Democrats have developed flagship policies that confront some of the deepest problems in our society. For the millions of elderly men and women who have not shared in the country's growing prosperity, the package of Liberal Democrat proposals offers the elderly, and women in particular, a just and fair new deal: much more generous pensions for those 75 and older, free personal health care, and local income tax replacing council tax. </p> <p>Pensioners could be more than \u00a32,000 better off each year. The elderly are not the only losers in our society. The rich are becoming much richer, the poor are standing still. Over the last 10 years, the remuneration of directors rose by 288% - and that of ordinary employees on average only 45%. Many of our fellow citizens are being priced out of the housing market, or live far from work and are then penalized by the cost of public transport - wildly more expensive than in other European countries.</p> <p>Against this background, it is right to ask the best off in our country to contribute a little more in tax, so that less well-off people can send their children to University, and ensure proper care for their older relatives. The 'Orange Book' has been greeted by commentators as a restatement of Liberal democrat belief in the free market. I have no problem with markets once we remember they are embedded in the political and legal system of any society.</p> <p>In the USA, healthcare is seen as a market. A free market, without the values and constraints of the rule of law and a belief in the value of each individual human life, can become a jungle in which power replaces law. I know - I saw what a free market without independent courts and democratic accountability did to Russia in the 1990s, consigning millions to extreme poverty and making a few unbelievably rich.</p> <p>So Liberal Democrats must always bear in mind our commitment to social justice, rooted in the radicalism of a Lloyd George and the practical compassion of a William Beveridge.</p> <p>Finally, we are faced with hugely difficult judgements on the balance between security and individual liberty in an age of terrorism. It is all too easy to destroy democracy in the name of security, as both Guantanamo Bay and the recent announcement by President Putin of Russia, to abolish elections for regional governors and bar independents from standing for the Duma, have shown. How have the British government responded? They have postponed publication of the Foreign Office's Human Rights report, because this is a 'sensitive time'.</p> <p>I am proud of the way Liberal Democrats have insisted that liberties should never be sacrificed unless it is absolutely imperative to do so. Difficult and delicate judgements on these matters will have to be made in the new Parliament, and will affect our democracy for years to come.</p> <p>I would feel happier about the robustness of our democracy if the Blair Government took its accountability to Parliament and the people more seriously. The Hutton and Butler reports showed that many crucial decisions are made in private bilateral meetings, that no minutes are kept, and that the Cabinet is often bypassed.</p> <p>In the Butler report's words, the Government's procedures have taken on an informal and circumscribed character. In layman's terms, that is 'sofa government'.</p> <p>Governments must be held to account. If they are not, democracy itself fades away. </p> <p>Let me end by congratulating our outstanding Liberal Democrat parliamentary and council candidates, and the legions of Liberal democrat activists who support them, for the amazing results of the last few years.</p> <p>We have broken through against both the Conservatives and Labour, and in my view it is important to see both of the old parties, not just one, as our political target.</p> <p>The mould may not yet be broken, but the crack is dramatically widening.</p>",
  "<p>Tropical Storm Jeanne brought mudslides and flooding to Haiti, killing at least 90 people in the last few days as emergency services struggle to reach families stranded in the worst hit areas.</p> <p>Two days of rain sent torrents down mountains in the country's Artibonite and North-west provinces, causing rivers to burst their banks, civil defence officials said. </p> <p>The floods tore through the coastal town of Gonaives and outlying districts, covering crops and roads.</p> <p>Much of Gonaives was still under waist-deep water yesterday and aid workers were finding it difficult to evacuate all those in need, said a spokesman for the interior ministry. </p> <p>Interim Prime Minister Gerard Latortue declared the town a disaster area and called on the international community to provide immediate humanitarian aid. \"We don't know how many dead there are,\" he said.</p> <p>The Catholic humanitarian agency Caritas Internationalis collected 62 bodies in pickup trucks and counted another 18 at one morgue in Gonaives, said Reverend Venel Suffrard, the organisation's local director. </p> <p>A further 10 people were reported to have been killed in other parts of the country and Rev Suffrard said he expected the toll to rise.</p> <p>Residents said the floods caught Gonaives by surprise on Saturday night. Jean-Baptiste Agilus, a 46-year-old teacher, said he watched the deluge engulf local houses, sweeping away one woman with her two children. \"The water rushed into their home, all the homes in the neighbourhood,\" he said. \"It destroyed everything.\" </p> <p>The storm, which hit Haiti just four months after floods killed more than 3,000 people on the Haitian-Dominican border, has been blamed for at least 10 deaths in other countries over the weekend. Seven died in the Dominican Republic - which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti - and three in Puerto Rico. Unlike the Dominican Republic, much of Haiti has been deforested leaving it more vulnerable to flood damage.</p> <p>Forecasters said Jeanne did not appear to be on course for the south-eastern United States. It was expected to turn south over the next two days and head back out into the Atlantic, away from Florida and other states which have been battered by three major storms this season, including Hurricane Ivan last week.</p>",
  "<p>More than a third of the waste paper and plastic collected by British local authorities, supermarkets and businesses for recycling is being sent 8,000 miles to China without any knowledge of the environmental or social costs - and to the complete surprise of most consumers. </p> <p>New government figures suggest that exports to China are running at 200,000 tonnes of plastic rubbish and 500,000 tonnes of paper and cardboard a year - a huge increase on just three years ago.</p> <p>Much of the plastic sent to China is packaging but a Guardian investigation has found that agents for Chinese companies are now buying up and exporting thousands of tonnes of unwashed bottles, containers, and other household waste.</p> <p>\"China is buying up everything it can. It is sucking in material from all over the world and it doesn't give two noodles what it takes,\" said one plastics recycler who asked not to be identified. \"I know of 300 firms, mostly in China, offering to buy my plastics. I have three or four companies cold-calling me every day from China requesting material. They have very cheap labour to sort the material but the shame is that it is being done there and not here. They don't care about the quality, or the contamination. No one checks what is sent or what arrives.\"</p> <p>The British plastics industry admits that the global trade is starving some local recycling initiatives of materials and putting established firms out of business or at risk. According to UK plastic recyclers, agents for Chinese companies areoffering \u00a3120 a tonne for mixed plastic bottles, far more than British companies can pay. \"The industry here can only support \u00a350 a tonne. We believe that 10-15,000 tonnes of old bottles are going to China. Yet only about 25,000 tonnes were collected last year\", said Stephen Chase of Chase Plastics.</p> <p>\"The Chinese put me out of business,\" said Edward Clack, a plastics recycler who invested in two recycling plants in Britain. \"Everyone has lost supplies to China. The local market is being starved of materials. Hundreds of brokers are buying up the plastic and shipping it out. It's cheaper to send a container to China than to Scotland.\"</p> <p>China drives the global waste trade, importing more than 3m tonnes of waste plastic and 15m tonnes of paper and board a year. But the trade is being driven equally by tough EU legislation forcing local authorities and businesses to recycle more. Landfill charges are rising steeply, making it relatively cheaper to send the waste abroad. Meanwhile, major companies have moved in, offering to collect and dispose of large quantities.</p> <p>The trade is made possible by the vast numbers of shipping containers arriving in Britain with Chinese exports. One of Britain's largest freight forwarding companies confirmed that the return waste trade to China is accelerating rapidly.</p> <p>\"We are shipping a phenomenal amount of waste, maybe 15,000 tonnes a week to China,\" said a spokesman for Warrant freight forwarders of Liverpool. The current price for sending a standard 26-tonne container of waste plastic to China, he said, is about \u00a3500.</p> <p>The Tanjin Songzi Import and Export Trade company based in the huge port of Tianjin Xingang is typical of the growing trade. \"We are specilize [sic] in import the scrap plastic bottle, waste plastic, waste paper. Europe origin. Please show me your offer,\" says its advertisement on an international plastics exchange website brimming with traders wanting the raw material for the Chinese industrial revolution.</p> <p>Most Chinese plastic waste importers want pictures of what they are buying, but some are are not fussy. \"We buy all types, such as the mineral water bottles, pure water bottles and plastic bottles of other drink. Any specifications will be fine. If you can supply, please email,\" says Mr Lee of a Shanghai company on the same site.</p> <p>Western plastic companies are setting up in China, but some of the poorest people are employed to sort and recycle the plastic. \"Plastic is now one of the biggest industries in Guangdong province, but much of the work is being done by migrant labour earning a pittance,\" said Martin Baker, of Greenpeace China.</p> <p>\"I would say that Britain is dumping its rubbish in the name of recycling. It is not responsible recycling that is being done. It is reprocessing, but the methods being used are still mostly rudimentary. There are some good factories, but on the whole it is small scale, done in backstreets with little environmental standards. People are burning plastic, sorting it by hand, the water gets polluted and it goes back into the rivers,\" he said.</p> <p>UK supermarket chains, some of the largest generators of plastic packaging waste in Britain, are all getting their recycling done in China, said a spokesman for Sainsbury's. \"We send 5,000 tonnes of plastic there a year. We used to send it to a firm in Nottinghamshire, but it has closed down,\" he said. \"We looked for others in Britain but no one could match the Chinese option for quantity or price. We would love to see it being recycled here, but it's not possible at present.\"</p> <p>But Ian Bowles, a spokesman for Asda, said he did not know where the company's plastic recycling was being done. \"UK companies pick it up. As far as we know it's being reprocessed here. It could be that excess quantities are going abroad.\" Other retailers known to be generating large quantities of plastic waste, including Tesco, did not respond to questions about where their recycling was being done.</p> <p>No detailed studies have been done of the environmental costs of shipping vast quantities of waste from Britain to China, but environment groups and MPs were yesterday shocked at the scale of the trade. \"Exporting lightweight packaging waste to China makes little sense environmentally,\" said Liberal Democrat MP Sue Doughty. \"It is a failure of the UK recycling market which allows the UK to export plastic for recycling. We have no control over environmental standards in China. Instead of solving the problem we are exporting it. Much more needs to be done to stimulate the markets in the UK so that waste is handled as close as possible to the point of generation.\"</p> <p>Clare Wilton, wastes spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth, said: \"People will be shocked that some of the newspapers and empty drinks bottles they put out for recycling can end up in China. It's an environmental disgrace. The solution is to expand the UK's own recycling industry. This would be good for the environment, create local jobs and help Britain become a leader in green technology.\"</p> <p>Sending plastic bottles to China is \"barmy\", said Mike Croxford, manager of Newport Wastesavers, which collects 50 tonnes a month of plastic from 50,000 homes in south Wales. \"We should be dealing with the stuff here, but the reality now is that most plastic in Britain is going abroad. I don't think the public knows where some of it goes. If they knew it was going right round the world, they might not encourage it.\"</p> <p>But other recyclers said it was better to send rubbish to China to be recycled than to put it in landfill in Britain. Andrew Simmons of the Peterborough-based waste charity Recoup buys millions of plastic bottles from UK councils, bales them up, and sells them to a reprocessor who then sells them on to Europe or, increasingly, to China. He rejected claims that Britain was dumping its rubbish on China and said that the environmental cost of sending bottles thousands of miles was negligible compared with making \"virgin\" plastic bottles from oil.</p> <p>China is increasingly aware that countries are exporting their pollution to them and have imposed strict laws governing what can be exported. Large amounts of German household waste have been found and all waste exports from Japan have recently been halted after electronic and contaminated household waste was found. However, the Chinese authorities, plagued by corruption, are unable to check the contents of all the waste containers that arrive in Chinese ports every year.</p> <p>British plastic bottles are mostly sent to Hong Kong where they are sorted and \"flaked\" before being sent to factories on the mainland. \"One type of plastic bottle goes on to make soft furnishings and clothes, another is made into pellets which are sold back to European manufacturers to make things like plastic bags,\" said Mr Simmons.</p> <p>This insatiable demand for the world's rubbish, he said, has actually boosted the British market for plastic recyclers, raising the price and making it far more worthwhile for councils to collect and not dump it in landfill. Partly because of this, more than half of all British local authorities now offer plastic recycling.</p> <p>More and more British plastic is likely to go to China, said Tim Frier of Valpac, whose subsidiary, Valiant, collects waste from more than 5,000 businesses in Britain, including supermarkets, pubs and clubs, and sends up to 15,000 tonnes of plastic to China a year. Valpac has just opened an office in China.</p> <p>\"We will be sending more there. But they have strict rules. The problem was that a lot of waste going to China was contaminated, and not being sorted properly. There were concerns about British waste, too,\" he said.</p> <p>The government insists that companies have export licences but few if any checks are made in British ports. The Environment Agency admits that it is unable to check what is being exported.</p> <p>\"There is a legitimate trade in waste exports for recovery involving materials such as paper, ferrous metals, plastics and card. These wastes are classed as 'green list' and are not subject to the same level of control as wastes classed as hazardous,\" said a spokesman.</p>",
  "<p>The food and consumer goods giant Unilever today delivered disappointing news to shareholders as it cut its annual profit growth forecast.</p> <p>Shares in the company, whose products include Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise, tumbled by 6.1% to hit a four-year low of 452.25p following the profit warning.</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch giant blamed wet weather for poor ice cream sales, and also pointed to strong competition in washing powders and soaps. However, analysts said today's profit warning, which followed weak sales growth, indicated more deep-seated problems.</p> <p>Andrew Saunders, an analyst at Numis Securities, said Unilever had focused too much on cutting costs to support earnings rather than driving sales growth through advertising spending. </p> <p>\"Investors want earnings growth, but not earnings growth if you're not spending enough on the top brands and just saving money,\" he told Reuters. </p> <p>The group's chairmen, Antony Burgmans and Niall FitzGerald, said in a statement: \"Top line growth is key to long-term sustainable value creation, and here the recent performance is unacceptable.\"</p> <p>Mr FitzGerald is stepping down at the end of this month, and will be replaced by Patrick Cescau, the head of the group's food division. </p> <p>His five-year path to growth strategy, intended to push up sales and profit margins, finishes at the end of this year. It has been a limited success, and the group has abandoned main aim of growing its top brand sales by 5-6% by the end of 2004. </p> <p>In its profit warning, Unilever said it now expected annual underlying earnings per share to grow by less than 5% - compared with its previous forecast of more than 10% - after weaker than forecast trading during July and August. </p> <p>Rudi Markham, the group's finance director, blamed substantially lower sales of ice cream and Lipton teas in northern Europe because of poor weather, and also said it had been hit by increased competition for laundry products, soaps and shampoos in Europe and Asia.</p> <p>Unilever warned that sales of its 400 leading brands, such as Knorr, Lux and Sunsilk, would fall in the third quarter of 2004 after a flat performance during the second quarter. </p> <p>Sales of the top brands, which make up more than 95% of total group sales, rose 0.5% in the first half, and Unilever is now very unlikely to meet February forecasts that growth would improve from the 2.5% rise seen in 2003.</p>",

  "Delegates will have an opportunity to revisit the debate on the Iraq war, as this morning sees them addressed by the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Sir Menzies Campbell, and vote on motions on the \"war on terror\" and the Hutton report. <p>Following on from last night's press conference, where the party leader, Charles Kennedy, called on the prime minister to come to the House of Commons and apologise - or face accusations of \"bad faith\" - the Bournemouth conference will see debates on \"reducing the risk of terrorism\" as well as the broader issue of international trade and investment.</p> <p>Lib Dem grandee Lady Williams will also address the conference - something of a valedictory speech from one of the party's best-loved figures, as the former SDP co-founder has announced she will be stepping down as Lib Dem leader of the Lords after November's Queen's speech. Her 11am speech is likely to be an emotional affair.</p> <p>The afternoon continues the internationalist theme, with debates on asylum and immigration, and on the party's position on the promised referendum on the new EU constitution. </p> <p>There will also be a half-hour question and answer session with Mr Kennedy, hosted by the Independent editor Simon Kelner, whose paper is sponsoring the conference. </p> <p>Also likely to attract attention is an address from the self-styled \"shadow chancellor\", Vincent Cable, whose personal antipathy to the Lib Dems' traditional \"tax and spend\" stereotype since taking over from former Treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor has attracted praise from the party's so-called \"young Turks\" and the rightwing press, as well as some concern from the party leadership.</p> <p><b>Pick of the fringe</b><br> Civil service union leader Mark Serwotka will debate Gordon Brown's proposed cull of 100,000 civil servants this lunchtime with Mr Cable.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Guardian's fringe event sees Simon Hoggart ask Sir Menzies Campbell, Nick Clegg and others whether the Lib Dems stand for liberty or equality.</p>",
  "A plan by the home secretary, David Blunkett, to establish processing camps outside of Europe to deal with asylum seekers has been revived after being taken up by the German and Italian governments. <p>Tunisia has been named by the German government as a possible site for the European Union camps, which will allow asylum seekers heading for Britain and the rest of Europe to apply for refugee status without having to pay people traffickers to smuggle them to London. </p> <p>Italy is funding camps in Tunisia to control the migrant flow from central Africa. </p> <p>The idea was first proposed by Mr Blunkett a year ago but met opposition from Otto Schilly, the German interior minister, who said it would increase rather than reduce the numbers trying to get into Europe. It was put on ice after Tony Blair failed to win support for it at the EU summit in Greece in June 2003. </p> <p>But appalled at the rising death toll amongst migrants who have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean, Mr Schilly has changed his mind. </p> <p>He has adopted the British plan, with the details to be thrashed out at a meeting of the G5 nations of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain in Florence next month. </p> <p>\"The problems of Africa should be solved with the help of Europe in Africa, they cannot be solved in Europe,\" he told last month's meeting of European justice and home affairs ministers. </p> <p>The plan has also been backed by the EU's incoming \"justice, freedom and security\" commissioner, Rocco Buttiglione, from Italy. </p> <p>He has been Silvio Berlusconi's minister for Europe for three years, and said recently the EU was in danger of being \"swamped\" by an \"immigration time bomb\". </p> <p>Earlier this month Mr Buttiglione said: \"We have to ask transit countries to establish the camps that would take in immigrants who, for example, arrive from sub-Saharan Africa, to offer them humanitarian aid and information about job possibilities in Europe. </p> <p>\"But they would also investigate, identify and send back those who don't meet the criteria or who would not be able to integrate into our society.\" </p> <p>The move comes at a time when the EU is drawing up an asylum policy that could see a temporary resettlement scheme put in place for those in need of international protection. It would also include set targets for the numbers each country would take. </p> <p>British MEP Graham Watson, the leader of the Liberals in the European parliament, said they would oppose the project as he believed it ran counter to the European convention on human rights. \"If Mr Buttiglione chooses the road of confrontation he can expect a rocky ride,\" he said. </p> <p>A Home Office source said it welcomed the project being \"taken out of the icebox\" but wanted to see the detail of what is to be proposed at the Florence meeting. </p> <p>The original British plan insisted that the opening up of a new legal route to refugee status in Britain, through a camp based outside the EU's borders, would not replace the right to claim asylum for those who arrived in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>People called Hunter probably had ancestors who were good at killing animals, and so we can assume that Al Swearengen, the main character in Deadwood, the latest hot import from American television, is so called because he had forebears who swore. </p> <p>A brothel-owner who uses the words \"cocksucker\" and \"fuck\" at the rate other people say hello, Swearengen speaks like this for reasons of history. Whether or not the dialogue is true to South Dakota in 1876, the series' setting, is a matter of opinion, but Al is obeying the language rules of shows produced since the 1990s by the American cable network HBO. </p> <p>In The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Six Feet Under, this company has created an alternative culture of US television, in deliberate opposition to the big networks, whose work is made nervous by advertisers and the perceived Republican churchiness of the core American audience. One of HBO's declarations of difference was to put a foul-mouth where its money is. But, even by previous standards, Deadwood has really taken the oath in this regard. In the script by David Milch (a graduate of Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue), there's barely a speech in the bars, brothels and dust roads of the gold-rush era that doesn't feature the c-word, the f-word and the c-s word. </p> <p>The justification for this - thematically if not historically - is that it's the language of anarchy and defiance. Vocabulary has broken down in the town because so has everything else: Deadwood is in Indian territory, so beyond the reach of American law. Murders occur at the rate of one a day. This series has been the season's hit in America and, whether or not it was intended, this story of lawlessness outside the control of the American authorities can clearly be read as an allegory of Baghdad. </p> <p>Apart from freedom with expletives, what HBO's biggest successes have in common is that they bring the grammar of serial television to movie genres: Sex and the City is a more sexual and feminist rendition of the genre of Manhattan romantic comedy, while The Sopranos resembles what The Godfather and GoodFellas might have become if they had run for 40 hours and been co-scripted by the writers of Analyze This. </p> <p>Deadwood is a television answer - or, perhaps more accurately, a series of questions - to the cinematic western. The director even comes from that tradition: Walter Hill, who made The Long Riders. But what he and Milch have made here is a western that is slow, vicious and nihilistic in a way that very little cinema - and almost no television outside of HBO - would dare to be. The opening episode begins with a hanging and then gets darker. </p> <p>History claims that 90% of the women in Deadwood in the 1870s were prostitutes, and the men of the town buy themselves \"some pussy\" either as a stiffener before going outside to kill someone, or as a reward for having done so. When a man is shot through the head, the local doc casually pushes a rod through the front of his skull to calculate the trajectory. Even less sentimentally, another corpse is used as pig-food. </p> <p>The drama is dark literally as well as tonally. Hill's favoured set-up is a heavily shadowed foreground with the blazing tear-drop of a candle-flame or gas-light at the back. And, when it isn't sounding like subway graffiti, Milch's script has some sweeter moments. When one pioneer reveals, \"I was born in Austria!\", another replies: \"Wonderful where people come from!\" </p> <p>This touches on the idealism of America's history of immigration - although Deadwood shows the dreamers turning to greed and hatred - and so it's appropriate that Deadwood is itself a drama of second chances. Walter Hill has been a neglected director and Ian McShane, who gives a combination of savagery and canniness to Al Swearengen, is saved from toshy mid-Atlantic mini-series by this his best part for many years. </p> <p>HBO is still most widely celebrated for a series about sexuality - Sex and the City - but it's becoming increasingly clear that the outfit's signature subject is death. In The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and now the first of its series actually to have the funeral adjective in its title, these shows have looked unflinchingly at the plot-twist that lies at the end of all our stories. Despite its haul of corpses, Deadwood breathes further life into American television. </p> <p><strong>Day of judgement</strong></p> <p>One of the implications of last night's Greg Dyke documentary shown on Channel 4 was that the post-Hutton BBC might be wary of what it says about Blair. This has been a widespread fear inside and outside the Corporation, but promising contradiction comes in two documentaries marking a decade since Dyke's nemesis became leader of the Labour party. If this is going easy on the prime minister, then he should hope that he is forever spared the hard. </p> <p>The twinned films - one about Blair and the other concerning Blair and Brown's relationship - are fronted by Michael Cockerell, who in recent years has made a distinctive series of documentaries in which retired politicians reflect on their careers by watching scenes of themselves from the BBC archives. </p> <p>Although often spiky - Roy Jenkins and Edward Heath, among others, bristled at certain questions - the politicians that Cockerell was dealing with in this series belonged to biographers rather than journalists. So taking on the serving holders of the two highest posts in British politics would have been a bold development even before Hutton. </p> <p>The change of tactic also alters Cockerell's structure. Denied a contemporary interview with either Blair or Brown, he is reliant on chats with their acolytes and clips from his own programmes. </p> <p>This recycling, though, is the programmes' strength. For all the bleats about repeats, it can be argued that too much of television's output is forgotten. Here, Cockerell devastatingly rescreens footage of Brown and Blair's early TV appearances - and later photo-opportunities to suggest agreement between No 10 and No 11: an uneasy tennis match, a night in drinking beer in front of the footie. </p> <p>The first of the films, Do You Still Believe in Tony?, features media figures - Richard Eyre, Rory Bremner, John O'Farrell - explaining how they lost their faith in Blair. The journey from reverence in 1997 to incredulity now is bleakly charted and, if Alastair Campbell were still at No 10, this programme alone would be enough for attempts to get the BBC closed down. </p> <p>The second documentary, Friends and Neighbours, is a sharp job of reporting on the tensions of the PM-chancellor relationship which, Cockerell is told, are known to the staff of the two men as either \"the TB-GBs\" or, after events in New York three years ago, as \"10/11\". </p> <p>The film is filled with such details worthy of a real-life The West Wing, which, we learn, is Tony's favourite programme, while Gordon's is Friends. We're also told (by former spin-doc Charlie Whelan) that Blair would beg for chummy photo-ops with Gordon when the euro caused him trouble. In the most chilling use of archive, Cockerell finds a scene in which Brown, passing Blair in a Downing Street corridor, almost ignores him. </p> <p>Elegantly made and editorially brave, these films are likely to ensure that Blair and Brown won't be available to Cockerell if he ever wants to make one of his old-style programmes to coincide with their out-of-power memoirs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Deadwood, Tuesday, 10pm, Sky One <br> Do You Still Believe in Tony? and Friends and Neighbours, Saturday, BBC2</p>",
  "<p>It is only once every two years we become truly European, prepared to forgive our neighbours for trying to ban our cheese and onion crisps (allegedly), and saying our chocolate had to contain chocolate rather than vegetable fat, dubbin, the remains of small rodents and all that other stuff we like to put in it; happy to overlook outrages like Europop, lederhosen and Maurice Chevalier. The most unreconstructed Eurosceptic, I suspect, will have been transfixed by our continent's Ryder Cup performance yesterday. </p> <p>Which led me to thinking about what it means to be a European. I think the chief difference between us and the Americans is that, on seeing Donald Trump, we are more likely to look beyond the billions and focus on the hair; which is the hair of a man who has gone to his stylist with a picture of Melvyn Bragg cut out of the newspaper, and said, \"That's what I want but more ginger.\" </p> <p>Trump was one of the star turns at the Ryder Cup opening ceremony, at which there were frequent references to the \"worldwide audience of millions\" but little allowance made for viewers born outside the United States. </p> <p>Co-presenter with Trump, of whom we might at least have been expected to have heard, although without any precise knowledge of how he became so rich and famous - was \"model and actress\" Angie Everhart. Who she? Well, I can tell you, with all the authority of someone with a broadband connection, she has been in a number of films, none of which are in immediate danger of troubling the compilers of Sight and Sound's films of the decade list, and was once squired by Sylvester Stallone - if squired is the word I am looking for. </p> <p>Angie and Don read alternate lines off a teleprompter, in the style of what the Americans like to call co-anchors. It was typically cornball stuff, with the Trumpster drawing comparisons between the worlds of golf and business: \"I'm a competitive kinda guy,\" he declaimed. \"When you compete in my world, it's all about striking quickly and making the deal. In the world of championship golf it's about striking accurately and closing the deal.\" </p> <p>Cheers and whoops greeted these platitudes, as they did Angie's opening salvo: \"Like many luminaries that will share the stage with us today, Donald and I love being part of this glorious event. Golf is in our heart.\" </p> <p>With these words she adopted her most sincere look and placed her right hand across her small but perfectly formed chest, bringing to mind the crack prompted by a bare-chested Victor Mature in one of those biblical epics, which Groucho Marx or someone described as the first film to feature a leading man with bigger breasts than the leading lady. </p> <p>The ceremony was replete with anchors, the next of whom was Larry Moody, president of something called \"Search Ministries\" who, said Angie, would \"lead us into the invocation\". </p> <p>Larry was one of those expensively suited, silver-haired, khaki-skinned smooth-talking preachers, much in evidence in America, whom one would not wish to deny a stage like the Ryder Cup on which to put their message across, as Christians in the United States currently have only 30 or 40 slots on the TV dial. </p> <p>He said we should be grateful for golf professionals everywhere and come to the Ryder Cup with \"an attitude of graciousness to all participants, an attitude of gratitude,\" was how he summed it up before handing over to Kathy Ireland, another \"model and actress\" whose name I suspect will have been less than familiar to the viewing public in Stavanger and Chipping Norton. </p> <p>According to the MC Dan Hicks, Ms Ireland was \"a best friend to working mothers and a true lifestyle designer\", a reputation acquired through her work as design expert on the Oprah Winfrey Show, which means she may at least have been glimpsed by the odd European viewer, checking out satellite channels at two in the afternoon. Which is more than can be said for the coaches of the Detroit Pistons (basketball) and the Detroit Wings (ice hockey), also on the roster of star guests. </p> <p>Kathy's task was to welcome to the stage \"the loved ones\" of captains and players, without whom blah, blah, blah, the description \"loved ones\" being a neat portmanteau term and a useful substitute for \"wife\" or \"girlfriend\" which might embarrass those players going through costly divorces and those who have one or more of each. </p> <p>The American team's loved ones, however, made few concessions to the messiness of modern relationships, dressing in identical neat tailored red jackets, in obvious homage to the remake of The Stepford Wives. </p> <p>None of this is to say that the Americans did not put on an impressive opening show, as you might expect from the nation that more or less invented showbusiness. </p> <p>I wonder, though, if the touch of arrogance the opening ceremony betrayed - it was as if Britain were to choose as our representatives on the world stage Trinny and Susannah, Steve McClaren and Danny Baker - may have contributed to America's poor start. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto: martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk\"> martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p> There was an assurance about Mark Hughes, a self-belief that was tangible. It was there before the match as he strode confidently to the touchline to receive the acclaim of Blackburn's fans, and again afterwards as he reflected on the differences with his first match in charge of Wales. \"Back then I didn't know what I was doing,\" he said. \"I know exactly what I'm doing now.\" </p> <p>His inaugural week as Blackburn manager has already incorporated a first victory of the season, plus the beginnings of a new chapter in Matt Jansen's career, but there have been more subtle changes too. An overhaul of training procedures is under way and Hughes is clearly willing to employ some unorthodox methods. </p> <p>In the dressing room afterwards several players misheard his instructions. \"I thought he said we had a nice bath waiting,\" said Jansen. \"It turns out it was an ice bath. And we had to jump in four times, for 30 seconds each time.\" </p> <p>His players were willing to obey his orders - \"worse than you could ever imagine,\" said Jansen - just as they had been ready to stretch every sinew for Hughes on the field of play. Barry Ferguson epitomised the indefatigability, finally showing glimpses of the ability that persuaded Hughes's predecessor Graeme Souness, to pay Rangers \u00a37m for the midfielder. Paul Dickov was equally ubiquitous. Jon Stead, still searching for his first goal of the season, could scarcely have tried harder. </p> <p>Even so the match was drifting listlessly towards a stalemate until the 65th minute when Hughes sent on Jansen for Morten Gamst Pedersen. It was an endearing story. In June 2002, a taxi shot out of a side street in Rome and crashed into the hired moped that Jansen was riding. He was flung from the bike and hit his head on the pavement. Had he not been wearing a crash helmet he would probably have been dead. As it was, he spent 10 days in hospital before a long, slow rehabilitation. Since then he has never convinced Souness he could get back to the exhilarating heights that had put him on the fringes of the England squad. </p> <p>His first couple of touches - misplacing a simple pass, dribbling the ball out for a throw-in - befitted a man whose confidence under Souness was not so much low as subterranean. The crowd had given him a spontaneous standing ovation but Jansen seemed to be drifting out of the game until the 75th minute. Lucas Neill instigated the move, advancing through midfield before playing a quick pass into Jansen's feet. The striker controlled the ball impeccably and swept an instinctive shot beyond Shaka Hislop. </p> <p>\"I thought I had played my last game for the club,\" he said afterwards. \"My confidence has been destroyed, really. If the supporters had given up on me I might have thrown in the towel as well. Instead, this is a new start. It's been a long time coming and I'm determined to take it.\" </p> <p>Portsmouth's version of events will be far more cynical, namely that Hughes owes his winning start to the referee Mark Clattenburg who, rather than awarding a penalty for Brad Friedel's 88th-minute challenge on Ricardo Fuller, decided the striker had sought to deceive him and flourished a yellow card. Clattenburg was correct, to a certain extent, in that Fuller exaggerated his fall and had seemed to be waiting for a collision rather than showing any sign of attempting a shot. Nevertheless Friedel undoubtedly ran into his opponent, having presented him with the ball in the first place. \"An absolute, nailed-on penalty,\" seethed Harry Redknapp. \"How can he have dived when he's been smashed in the back? He's not Superman.\" </p> <p>Redknapp will also reflect on the relatively simple chance that Aiyegbeni Yakubu wafted horribly over the crossbar five minutes before Jansen's match-winning contribution. Yet Portsmouth did not show enough variation to their attacks once Eyal Berkovic left the field with a taut hamstring and, just as last season, they look a different side to that which frequently overwhelms opponents at Fratton Park. </p> <p>Overall, both clubs ought to be grateful that none of the First Division's three promoted clubs have won a single match yet. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match: </strong> Barry Ferguson (Blackburn Rovers)</p>"
