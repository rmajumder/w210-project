  "Members of a Lancashire mosque were yesterday wondering why ice cream vans could play their tunes on the streets of Blackburn while the calls that summon Muslims to prayers were banned. <p>Members of Blackburn with Darwen borough council have rejected a request by the Nurul Islam mosque to broadcast the adhaan through the mosque's loudspeakers.</p> <p>The congregation had submitted a petition with 182 signatures, and said the calls would be heard only in Audley Range, where most residents are Asian. </p> <p>But the planning committee last week refused to lift a 20-year ban, which applies to most mosques in Blackburn, home to 30,000 Muslims. Members said they had to consider residents from all faiths, and an appeal from a Christian church to ring bells five times a day would also be rejected. </p> <p>\"We have to consider there are some people in that area who are not of the Muslim faith,\" said one councillor, Fred Slater. </p> <p>Salim Mulla, the councillor for the ward containing the mosque, said yesterday he was very disappointed by the committee's decision. </p> <p>\"There are a couple of mosques in Blackburn which have permission to broadcast the adhaan five times a day,\" he said. \"That probably would not be right in an area where most people are not Muslims. But 90% of people in the Audley and Queen's Park areas are from the Asian community.\" </p> <p>Mr Mulla said the mosque had made the calls regularly for more than 10 years. \"But there were one or two complaints and they discovered they did not have permission.\" </p> <p>He said the live prayer call lasted about two minutes, and the mosque wanted to broadcast it only two or three times a day, not the prescribed five.</p>",
  "The Spanish government yesterday held out the promise of amnesty to illegal immigrants, saying it would offer full legal recognition to many already in the country and stop turning back boats before they reached its shores. <p>The move was welcomed by some as an attempt to end the exploitation of immigrant workers and reduce the number of people who drown trying to enter Spain.</p> <p>But it was attacked by the opposition, who said it was foolhardy to step out of line with the rest of Europe.</p> <p>Consuelo Rum\u00ed, the immigration minister, said foreigners with working contracts would be offered work permits and residency papers as part of the new immigration plan to be launched in September.</p> <p>Ms Rum\u00ed said the aim of the plan was two-fold: \"We want to facilitate the social integration of of foreigners and uncover the hidden economy that feeds off them.\"</p> <p>The move appears to contrast strongly with the approach elsewhere in Europe. The EU's incoming justice and home affairs commissioner, Rocco Buttiglione, told Reuters yesterday that the growing problem of people seeking asylum for economic reasons was a \"timebomb\".</p> <p>He called for transit countries around Europe's borders to set up holding camps for prospective immigrants.</p> <p>\"The camps would take in immigrants who, for example, arrive from sub-Saharan Africa, to offer them humanitarian aid and information about job possibilities in Europe,\" he said. \"But they would also investigate, identify and send back those who don't meet the criteria or who would not be able to integrate.\"</p> <p>For the past three years Mr Buttiglione has been a minister in Italy, which like Spain has sought to prevent immigrants entering by sea. The Italian approach has proved controversial.</p> <p>Its navy has tried to stop boats from landing and forced them out of Italian waters. In 2002, 65 immigrants died when their boat capsized while being towed by an Italian navy vessel.</p> <p>By contrast, the Spanish defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Bono, said at the weekend that the navy would no longer intercept immigrant boats in Spanish waters unless they needed immediate help. The decision is a recognition of the increasing dangers faced by would-be immigrants.</p> <p>A quarter of the immigrants entering the EU illegally do so through Spain and the summer months bring feverish activity across the Gibraltar Straits. Traffickers in highpowered speedboats play cat and mouse with coastguards to land people and drugs up and down the coast of Andalucia.</p> <p>The increasingly sophisticated technology used to combat the professional smugglers forces those with less resources to take ever more dangerous routes.</p> <p>Many prospective immigrants head out into the Atlantic in flimsy wooden boats in an attempt to avoid border patrols. They make for C\u00e1diz, 70 miles up the coast from Gibraltar, or try to cross the 60 miles of open water between Morocco and the Canary Islands.</p> <p>Six people died this weekend. Four sub-Saharan Africans drowned when their boat capsized just a few metres from the shore off Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. Police and holidaymakers managed to rescue 34. Two more bodies were found on the coast of mainland Spain.</p> <p>Ms Rum\u00ed blamed the previous government, of the Popular party, for many of the problems.</p> <p>\"That government left us in chaos,\" she said. \"They didn't regulate the flow of immigrants, they didn't control the borders, and they sustained confrontation with Morocco, with whom we are trying to re-establish cooperation.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, she hopes the PP would join a cross-party agreement on the issue.</p> <p>Such a prospect seems unlikely. The PP is angry that Spain is stepping out of line with the rest of Europe. \"We are very worried by this announcement,\" said Angeles Mu\u00f1oz, its immigration spokesman.</p> <p>\"The Socialists are planning a radical departure from a policy that was developed through consensus with our European partners. It's just not possible to have a different policy, and certainly not for Spain given our levels of unemployment\"</p> <p>Ms Rum\u00ed called on other European leaders to follow the Spanish lead and address the failings of their policies.</p> <p>\"We are sorting out these problems despite a lack of leadership from the EU and the international community,\" she said. \"Spain is already leading the debate over common entry criteria and the social integration of immigrants.\"</p> <p>The minister added that it was too early to say how many people would be affected by the change in rules. But she warned that the initiative would not change the situation for those who had just arrived in the country.</p>",
  "Under a tree in Liberia, I sit with six giggling women. They are internally displaced people, or IDPs, and they think I've lost my mind. My translator, Marline, who is also an IDP, is trying to translate my question: \"What do you do when you're a refugee and you get your period?\" <p>Marline asks me to repeat the question, makes sure she understands, and then translates. \"She want to know,\" she says, in lilting Liberian patois, \"what you do when you receive\" - and she raises her hands heavenwards - \"and you runnin'?\" Refugees have no time for linguistic niceties. Displaced, refugee, IDP - all it means is running, literally, for years. </p> <p>The women are still laughing at my question, but they answer it. You take a strip of your lappa (sarong), they say, if you've got one. You use it as a pad, if you've got any knickers left, and if you can find a stream and five minutes to stop, you wash it. They laugh, when I ask them how you wash in the bush, how you wash your children. They say it very slowly, all together, as if to a stupid person: \"No soap!\" They see that they can't explain properly how things were. They see that when they say, \"We had nothing\", I don't understand how much nothing that is. </p> <p>I get used to incomprehension in Liberia, where conversations go like this: \"When did you leave your home?\" \"When the war met me.\" \"Which one?\" Or, \"How was your child killed?\" \"Which one?\" </p> <p>The bafflement works both ways: I find it hard to understand how a country this devastated can still be standing. They can't understand why I don't know that the best place to hide a mobile phone from rebel soldiers is in your backside. The woman who tells me this mentioned it in passing, during an interview about the women's health programme she works on. I checked: she definitely meant \"in\" your backside, not next to it. </p> <p>She has had 14 years of war to learn this. Liberia started falling apart in 1989. Since then, a variety of armed men, women and children have ripped the country to bits, fighting under a variety of lethal acronyms: PRC, LPC, NPFL, INPFL, ULIMO-J, ULIMO-K, LURD, MODEL. President Charles Taylor, now safely in exile in Nigeria, was no better than his opponents. Now, nearly a year after peace was first declared, 750,000 Liberians - a quarter of the population - are still on the run from their homes. The streets of Monrovia are now bustling - I see furniture shops in blackened houses; a barber's shop in a charred bus shelter; a shop called \"Living Proof\" - but this is because the whole country has moved to the capital. The rest of Liberia is empty. Proportionately, this is equivalent to 12 million people, or more than the population of London, moving to Nottingham. </p> <p>After so many years of war, it got to the point where it didn't matter who the enemy was. \"Anyone with a gun,\" says Mary Kamara, an elegant woman who also works on the women's health programme. During an interview about her work, she remarked in passing that she had been a refugee since 1989. Mary's colleague Grace - beautifully dressed now, in her African clothes and gold jewellery, fitting no stereotype of what a refugee should look like - still keeps a bag packed every night. She used to sleep in her jeans, her money in her knickers. </p> <p>Not that it would have stayed there long: Liberia's fighters took everything. The child soldiers stole toys. The adult soldiers even stole dirty dishes. They took what they could, and they could take what they wanted. A third of Liberia's women have been stripped during the wars. A hand down your pants, fingers in your pubic hair, groping for money - it was so standard it was hardly worth commenting on. These women were stripped often enough to develop a verb for it. \"They naked me!\" And they laugh. Eventually I get used to this. </p> <p>\"We are a very peculiar people,\" says Grace. \"A lot of people will never be able to understand how we can laugh through the worst. They will launch a rocket and 20 people die and 30 minutes later, people will be looking for the humour in the situation. That's the way we've been able to carry on.\" She thinks they may have inherited some sort of genetic resilience from the freed American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847. It's all they have got, really: at last count, there were only 28 doctors in the country, and no psychiatrists. But the need is staggering. I ask women refugees if they know any women who have been raped, and they snort with laughter again. \"Ha! There are so many, I can't remember!\" </p> <p>When 60,000 displaced people moved into Monrovia's SKD stadium last year, the non-governmental organisation Concerned Christian Community found that of the 1,502 women registered with them, 626 had been raped. These are the ones still alive. I met women who had seen women raped with sticks and bayonets, by boys who said their private parts were too clean to use on women. \"If you met a child soldier,\" says Grace, \"they used to say, 'Woman da wat?' It means, 'Of what importance is a woman?' It means you are nothing. If they say that, forget it.\" </p> <p>In a Monrovia office at dusk, I meet General Janet Jackson. I had met plenty of refugees by then - over the course of two weeks in Liberia, I only met two people who hadn't been dis placed - and I wanted to see someone who had made them that way. Jackson qualified. She may not be as famous as other female fighters, such as Black Diamond, who fought in bikinis and carried rocket-propelled grenades with long painted nails, but she was a one-star general in Charles Taylor's militia, and a member of the presidential bodyguard. She is fearsome, and she is unapologetic. </p> <p>Jackson explains away atrocities such as the use of human intestines as checkpoint barriers as military tactics. \"If people see that, they scared of you.\" She says her forces carried out no rape, no murder. \"Only looting. Everyone did looting.\" She is lying, and she gives me the creeps. </p> <p>But Janet is Liberia's future, the same as Grace, Mary and Joanne. The same as Michael Smith, a 15-year-old boy whose fighting name was Death Squad, who - like more than 20,000 other boys and girls - has spent the past few years drugged, drunk or wrecking his country. Smith says he wants peace, and has cut his hair to prove it. Fighters had corn-rows, bandanas, dreadlocks. Now the only people who dare wear them are the shameless ones. </p> <p>Smith and Jackson say they are ready for peace, though they had nothing to do with creating it. Even so, it is holding. Liberia has been allocated the largest peacekeeping force in the world, after the US put its influence behind solving the problems of its once-important African satellite (Liberia has the largest CIA listening station in West Africa). A UN donor conference in February allocated more than $274m to Liberia's reconstruction, but there was little money for emergency assistance, in a country with little healthcare, endemic malnutrition, hardly any schools, teachers, or houses. </p> <p>\"Just take us home,\" say the women stuck in a camp outside Monrovia. \"We will rebuild.\" They will have to: 75% of the country's households are headed by women. It will be Marline and Grace and Mary who put Liberia back together, with mud and sticks or forgiveness. In the IDP camp, a young woman tells me how she was raped when she was four months pregnant, by a 15- year-old soldier. She sees him from time to time, because his parents live in the same camp. \"I want to ask him why he do that, but he runs away.\" </p> <p>Another young woman's brother joined the rebels, then came home and held his family up at gunpoint. Years later, in peacetime, he begged forgiveness. His sister gave him a T-shirt, a precious thing in an IDP camp with no spare clothes. I look at her with astonishment, and she shrugs. \"I'd still help him now if he asked,\" she says. \"He's my brother.\" </p> <p>But blind forgiveness only goes so far. Families are poor and stretched, and are used to the absence of their fighter in the family. \"If he wants to come back,\" says Allen Lincoln, who runs rehabilitation centres for child soldiers, \"how will they feed him? They can't even feed the kids they have.\" </p> <p>The disarmament process is supposed to help this - fighters who turn in their weapons receive $300 and rehabilitation training - but the first episode was a disaster. The UN was unprepared, and unarmed NGO workers faced 8,000 armed fighters who wanted their money on the spot. There was rioting and nine people died. There are other disincentives: in neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire, the disarmament programme offers $600 instead. To poor, bored ex-combatants, this is a red rag to travel. Armed, frustrated fighters on the move: it's not a peaceful prospect. </p> <p>Smith says he'll give in his weapon, find his parents, go home and be a mechanic. But like all his friends, he'll probably give up one weapon and keep another, just in case. Jackson has a shipping-container full, and no intention of being anyone's mechanic, because someone will pay her enough to fight again. \"Not here. I'll get $1,000 a month, at least. That's what my life is worth.\" She doesn't see the irony. </p> <p>\"We have a saying,\" says Mary Kamara, \"that all the devils have danced in Liberia.\" She's not sure whether the show's over, with people like Jackson around, or whether this is just the interval. But she'll give peace the benefit of the doubt, like Marline, Grace, Joanne and every other woman I meet. They have no choice. Woman da wat, in a Liberia on its knees? Woman da everything. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A Life Removed: Hunting for Refuge in the Modern World by Rose George is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "The family of the young Frenchwoman bludgeoned to death on a green in south-west London visited the murder scene yesterday to lay flowers in her memory. <p>Amelie Delagrange, 22, was found dying on Twickenham Green on Thursday night. Her parents, sister and uncle, who flew into London on Saturday, spent 15 minutes at the scene, leaving a bouquet of white lilies and farewell messages in French. </p> <p>One from her father read: \"You will always stay alive and stay in my heart, my little darling Lili, you whom I find so beautiful.\" </p> <p>Another, from her mother, said: \"Amelie, my angel, why do you leave your mother? I must live without you. I keep you in my heart forever and I keep your smile.\" </p> <p>Her sister wrote: \"You had found here the happiness you were looking for. Somebody has taken it.\" </p> <p>Detectives said an offender profiler believes Amelie's killer may be a local man with knowledge of the area. </p> <p>They are continuing to investigate whether the killing is connected with three other attacks in the area in the past 18 months, although the links remain tenuous. </p> <p>These include the murder of 19-year-old student Marsha McDonnell, who was beaten to death in nearby Hampton in February last year. </p> <p>A 16-year old-youth, arrested in connection with McDonnell's death, remains in detention under the Mental Health Act. </p> <p>A 17-year-old girl was injured in an attack in January last year, a mile from where McDonnell was killed, and a 34-year- old suffered a serious assault in Twickenham on April 18. </p> <p>The 17-year-old came forward to police after McDonnell's death. She had thought she was rendered unconscious after slipping on ice. </p> <p>Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Murphy said: \"It is genuinely too early to say whether or not there are links, but it has to be a main line of inquiry for us.\" </p> <p>Scotland Yard yesterday issued a slightly revised sequence of events for Ms Delagrange's movements on Thursday evening. </p> <p>She had been with friends in Crystals wine bar in London Road, wearing a white cardigan, a red top and white trousers, and white trainers with pink flashes. She had shoulder-length blond hair. </p> <p>After arriving in Britain two months ago to practise her English, she had been working at a delicatessen in Richmond. </p> <p>Shortly after 9.30pm on Thursday Ms Delagrange boarded a 267 bus opposite the police station in Twickenham. </p> <p>She missed her stop and got off at 9.45 at Fulwell bus garage, on Fulwell Road. </p> <p>The police said it appeared she walked back to Twickenham Green, a 10-minute walk to her home in Gould Road. </p> <p>At 9.51 she was seen passing the Loch Fyne fish restaurant. About 30 minutes later a member of the public flagged down a police car to report the body of a woman lying in Twickenham Green. </p> <p>Ms Delagrange was taken by ambulance to West Middlesex hospital, where she was pronounced dead shortly after midnight. </p> <p>A postmortem examination gave the cause of death as severe head injuries.</p>",
  "Today is the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition - an event of particular importance this year because 2004 is the UN's International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition. <p>Yet slavery continues: millions of women, children and men throughout the world are enslaved and no region is free from this abuse, even though it is illegal under international law. </p> <p>Slavery takes many forms. Boys as young as four are abducted from their families in South Asia to be used as camel jockeys in the United Arab Emirates; in west Africa young girls are used as domestic slaves while women are brought to western Europe and forced into prostitution.</p> <p>Human trafficking is the fastest growing form of slavery. A 2004 US government report estimates that around 800,000 people are trafficked across borders each year. (The figure does not include those trafficked within their countries.) </p> <p>The traffickers prey on people in impoverished areas who are excluded from opportunities or are in societies destroyed by war and other turmoil. </p> <p>Promising well-paid work or education and training unobtainable at home, they lure, trick and coerce people who are desperate to improve their lives into conditions to which they never agreed.</p> <p>Leela's experience is characteristic. Taken from India to the UK and promised well-paid work as a domestic servant, she was made to work from 6.30am to 11.30pm every day with only one hour off each week. </p> <p>She was forced to sleep on the kitchen floor and her employers locked her in the house when they went out. They took her passport, telling her that if she left her job she would be deported back to India. She had been promised \u00a3150 per week but she received nothing.</p> <p>The drafting of the Council of Europe's European Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings provides a valuable opportunity to protect victims of this crime throughout the EU</p> <p>For the convention to be truly effective, however, it must have at its heart measures that safeguard human rights. These include a requirement that member states allow trafficked people to stay in their countries for at least three months. Such a delay would allow victims to begin to recover from their ordeal and make informed decisions about their future. </p> <p>During this period, governments should provide access to a full range of services, including access to medical help, training and education, employment opportunities and financial support. </p> <p>Trafficked people also need to be granted renewable short-term residence permits, and those would be especially vulnerable if sent back home must be given the chance of permanent residence.</p> <p>Migrants are at particular risk because many developed countries' governments fail to acknowledge the growing demand for migrant labour. The International Organisation for Migration estimates that the original 15 EU states will need 68 million more foreign workers by 2050 just to stabilise their existing workforces due to ageing populations and declining birthrates. </p> <p>Despite this, some EU countries are imposing more restrictive immigration controls that make regular migration more difficult. This in turn increases the demand for smuggling and trafficking. </p> <p>Facilitating regular migration and protecting the human and labour rights of migrants are important steps in reducing trafficking in people. One step governments should take is signing or ratifying the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families, which no EU member state has done to date. </p> <p>This convention seeks to prevent and eliminate \"the clandestine movements and trafficking in migrant workers\" and extend the protection of human rights law to all migrant workers and their families throughout the migration process.</p> <p>It is vital European governments take steps to protect those who are most vulnerable to trafficking and help those who are victims of this crime.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Beth Herzfeld is press officer of the organisation Anti-Slavery International</p>",
  "<p>Looking out across the main plaza of the Santander Group's new, nearly finished headquarters on the outskirts of Madrid, it would be easy to forget you are still in Spain. The parched yellow fields in the background and the shallow rectangular pools and freshly planted cypress trees that break up the patio carry echoes of the country's Moorish past. </p> <p>But everything else says this is a super modern financial centre. You could be in Asia or South America or, most tellingly, the United States. </p> <p>And that, of course, is the point. Santander City, as it is known, is a clear statement of the bank's ambitions, and those ambitions are inspired by America. </p> <p>Emilio Botin, Santander's emblematic chairman, has maintained a healthy relationship with the US bank Wachovia ever since he sold it his stake in First Fidelity in 1995. A couple of years later he visited the bank's new campus headquarters at Charlotte, North Carolina, and it gave him an idea. </p> <p>Now, six angular buildings of grey stone, gun metal and dark glass spread out across the plain. Bamboo sprouts up from below, escalators dip beneath the pavement. At the heart of it sits the presidential building, a space-age ark, from where Botin looks out over the city. </p> <p>When the project was conceived Santander's transforming deals still lay ahead. But already the process of building through acquisition had left management scattered across the centre of Madrid. Botin knew that his ambitions would only make the problem worse. </p> <p>Santander City brings all the main people together in one place for the first time. It gives the bank a centre and a sense of identity. </p> <p><strong> American model</strong><br> </p> <p> The 150 hectare site is Spain's biggest ever real estate project. It has cost \u20ac480m (\u00a3325m). And by the end of the year, 6,000 Santander employees will be working there full time. </p> <p>If you start from the American premise that corporate efficiency is paramount, then you can't fault the project. Not only does it look great, it is cost effective and organisationally efficient. </p> <p>The sale of the city centre properties the bank owned has covered the entire cost and it will save a further \u20ac21m a year in rent. Having all the important people based in the same place saves an enormous number of man hours which would otherwise be spent in taxis running up and down the Castellana, Madrid's main boulevard. </p> <p>Botin has predicted a 30% increase in worker productivity. \"Bringing together formerly fragmented services leads to a significant saving in management and maintenance,\" he said at the project's official launch. </p> <p>\"Second, improving the possibilities of interaction between staff means a greater flow of ideas and knowledge.\" </p> <p>If, however, you take the European view that there are some abstract benefits in having your staff wander out into the city to drink coffee and shop and meet their friends from time to time, then Santander City has considerable drawbacks. </p> <p>The problem is, Botin's vision may be American, but most of his staff are European. </p> <p>So he has set out to persuade them. Santander City has free restaurants with free beer. It has a free cr\u00e8che. There are 17 free bus services running to different parts of Madrid and there are heavily subsidised mortgages for staff to buy homes in the town of Boadilla just down the hill. </p> <p><strong> Prison</strong><br> </p> <p> It is a major charm offensive. But the Spanish love to grumble, even those who work for the country's biggest bank. </p> <p>\"Spaniards don't go to bars for beer,\" says a building contractor from Boadilla who worked on the project. \"Maybe the British wouldn't understand, but we go for the people. In the Santander complex they are surrounded by the same people that they work with all day. It's just not the same. It feels like a prison. I wouldn't work there, and my friends who do aren't very sure.\" </p> <p>The prison comparison does tend to come up. It could be the double security fence plus cameras and dogs. Or the fact that the layout owes a debt to 18th century theories of discipline. Those floor-to-ceiling windows will make the traditional siesta seem uncomfortably exposed (the chairman's office has blinds). </p> <p>But few prisons look quite so stylish. And none has its own golf course. </p> <p>\"I think the whole deal is extremely generous,\" says one former Santander banker based in the Boadilla area. </p> <p>\"I don't have much patience for my friends at Santander when they complain about the move. They're being completely blind.\" </p> <p>He points out that many of the big corporations have moved out of the city in recent years and none have done as much for the staff as Santander. </p> <p>Other reports suggest that staff are already coming round to the idea. As they pass through the border controls of the futuristic city each morning on their way to the office, they may reflect: Santander has never been a place for traditionalists anyway.</p>",
  "The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, will today deliver a \"clear message\" to the Sudanese government that it must do more to stop the violence in Darfur. <p>Mr Straw, who is due to arrive in Khartoum this evening, told reporters at Heathrow airport that the Sudanese government would \"face the opprobrium of the world\" if it failed to rein in the Arab Janjaweed militia by the UN security council deadline of August 30. </p> <p>The foreign secretary was flying into the Sudanese capital as talks in Nigeria between the Sudanese government and the two rebel groups challenging the country's Islamist regime appeared deadlocked.</p> <p>Sudan's negotiator, Mazjoub al-Khalifa, rejected the offer of African Union troops to disarm the rebels, saying his government would \"disarm the rebel movements, the Janjaweed and other militia\".</p> <p>Abubakar Hamid Nour, of the Justice and Equality Movement, today told Reuters that was unacceptable. \"There is no way we can let our enemies disarm us. They are still killing us and bombing us,\" he said.</p> <p>Sudan's government has been accused of unleashing the Janjaweed, and backing its campaign of violence, to quell the rebellion by the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Army.</p> <p>The violence has led to around 1.2 million African villagers fleeing the region, an exodus that, according to the latest UN estimates, has led to the deaths of 600 people a day. </p> <p>Mr Straw will tonight meet the Sudanese foreign minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, and is due to visit Abu Shouk, one of the biggest refugee camps in Darfur, tomorrow. He is scheduled to meet the Sudanese president, Umar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, on Wednesday. </p> <p>The British government, which is providing logistical support for African troops protecting monitoring mission in Darfur, is pushing for a bigger commitment from the African Union.</p> <p>It is particularly keen for troops to be sent from Arab north Africa, which would be more acceptable to Sudan's Arabic-speaking government. </p> <p>Mr Straw said he had told the leaders of Nigeria and Rwanda - both of which are involved in the monitoring mission, that Britain stood ready \"to provide further assistance if necessary\". </p> <p>He also insisted that, despite UN security council divisions over Sudan, there was \"an emerging consensus about the imperative need for the government of Sudan to relieve the humanitarian crisis, to provide for the safety of the displaced persons and to make sure there is an effective political process\".</p> <p>Foreign Office officials said Mr Straw had spent the weekend engaged in telephone diplomacy, speaking to the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, the UN's special representative in Sudan, Jan Pronk, and several senior ministers in countries bordering Sudan. </p> <p>One official said the point of Mr Straw's trip was \"to impress on the government of Sudan how seriously the international community takes this, to make his own first-hand assessment of the situation and to feed that back to Kofi Annan and others\". </p> <p>Downing Street said the foreign secretary would be taking a \"clear message\" that the government of Sudan must do more to meet its obligations under the UN security council resolution.</p>",

  "Cheikh Sarr's wife told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that, when she first met him seven years ago, she thought: \"This is a man with a big heart. He will make me happy. He will be the father of my children. And he will see me grow old.\" <p>Speaking to the newspaper from the only public telephone in her village, 120 miles from Dakar, in Senegal, she added: \"Unfortunately, only the last of my premonitions was wrong.\" </p> <p>Her husband died on Saturday August 21, in circumstances that have deeply moved Italians, making some pause for thought at a time when the latest summer upsurge in illegal immigration is being depicted by many politicians and commentators as a threat to the Italy's future. </p> <p>Like millions of Italians, Sarr, a 27 year-old building worker, went to the seaside with a friend that day. They opted for the beach at Marina di Castagneto, near Livorno. </p> <p>It was a blustery day and the sea was rough. Suddenly, they saw someone in difficulties in deep water. They plunged in. Sarr succeeded in reaching the man and pulling him towards the shore. But, in the last stages of his rescue effort, he was hit by a freak wave. </p> <p>\"I can still hear Cheikh as he held my hand crying out for help at the moment the wave carried him off,\" his Italian friend and workmate, Francesco Candeliere, said. </p> <p>It was not until 8pm that Sarr's lifeless body was washed back onto the darkened shore. By then, the way in which he was perceived had undergone a remarkable transformation. </p> <p>When he went into the water, he would have been looked on as a suspect \"extracomunitario\" (the Italians' odd term for foreigners - usually non-white - from outside the EU). He emerged from it as a hero. </p> <p>As his body was being prepared for its sad return journey to Senegal, journalists lauded his ultimate sacrifice. Italy's head of state, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, posthumously awarded him the nation's highest civilian honour for bravery. He declared him to be a \"shining example of outstanding courage, noble altruistic spirit and patently heroic virtue\". </p> <p>The president of the province of Florence, Matteo Renzi, wrote to the mayors of its 44 boroughs, proposing that each name a street in their town after the young African. </p> <p>Now, it is true that Italians - like everyone else - love a hero. A cynic might add that left-leaning Italians such as the provincial president of Florence are particularly fond of immigrant heroes, and never more so than when their political opponents are calling for tougher measures to stem the tide of illegal entries. </p> <p>However, there is another reason for the deep emotions rescue incident has stirred: a common sense of having been humbled. </p> <p>Italians pride themselves on being exceptionally civilised - and with reason. The very word civilisation was given to the world by their forebears. They have an unique history of cultural achievement. </p> <p>Italians are elegant, refined and sensitive. But, as this incident showed, some of them can be capable of breathtakingly self-centred don't give a damn attitude that Italians themselves call menefreghismo (from \"me ne frego\", or \"I couldn't care less\"). </p> <p>It emerged that the man rescued by Sarr, an Italian, had simply left the beach after being saved without offering a word of thanks or consolation. Nor, despite the extensive publicity given to the incident, has he come forward to express gratitude to the stricken relatives of the man who saved his life. </p> <p>Eyewitnesses described the man, who left without giving his name, as being around 40 years old, strongly built, with greying hair and a tattoo on his left arm. It is safe to say he is today the most unpopular man in Italy, a living, walking, yet anonymous embodiment of all that is least attractive in the national character. </p> <p>What makes his stubborn refusal to thank all the more painful to his compatriots is the dignified and moving reaction of Sarr's elder brother, Khadim. </p> <p>He denied that he felt any resentment towards the rescued man, but added: \"I just want him to give me the opportunity to take him silently in my arms, because I am sure that, in him, I would recover a part of the life of my brother.\"</p>",
  "<p>Forty years ago, when A Hard Day's Night was at the top of the hit parade and Sir Alec Douglas (later, Lord) Home was prime minister, a long-haired teenage Glaswegian anarchist was arrested in Madrid on a mission to assassinate General Franco with some plastic explosives he had smuggled across the border from France under his woolly jumper. He faced the possibility of death by Franco's favoured method of execution, the garrotte. </p> <p>He was spared that dance of death and served his sentence in Spain, only to return to England and, a few years later, find himself in the dock at the Old Bailey, accused of being a member of the Angry Brigade, which had been engaged in its own, more modest, efforts to change society in Britain. Now Stuart Christie, that young anarchist, is a 58-year-old freelance writer and publisher, husband and father, living in a seaside town in the south of England. Next week his autobiography, Granny Made Me An Anarchist, will be published. </p> <p>My first political demonstration, as a law student in Edinburgh, was when we marched down the high street in a torchlight procession carrying an effigy of said anarchist with a garrotte round his neck to protest against the arrest. The generalissimo was clearly frightened by this. Christie was sentenced to a mere 20 years in jail. </p> <p>\"I wish you'd kept the effigy,\" says Christie, now smartly turned out in a suit and a Christie tartan tie, when we meet in his local winebar. What Christie did keep, throughout his time inside and ever since, was his sense of humour: Granny Made Me An Anarchist is a wonderfully funny, engaging and self-deprecating account of a life that might easily have been snuffed out all those years ago in the shadows of Carabanchel prison, an account peppered with cultural and political reference points, from Just William and Leslie Howard in Pimpernel Smith, to Hegel and Hank Locklin's Wild Side of Life, to C Day Lewis and Bu\u00f1uel's Viridiana. </p> <p>Born in Partick, the son of a hard-drinking trawlerman and a hairdresser, Christie was named after the country's best-known Stuart, Bonnie Prince Charlie - \"the only man in history to be named after three separate sheepdogs\" as his fellow Partiquois, Billy Connolly, once said. His father departed one day for the legendary packet of fags and did not return for 20 years, so young Stuart was brought up by his mum, his grandad and his redoubtable, eponymous gran. </p> <p>She had been in service all her life, growing up in the gatekeeper's house in Lochnaw Castle in Galloway. He describes her ethical make-up as \"equal parts John Knox and village community.\" </p> <p>\"Basically, what she did was provide a moral barometer which married almost exactly with that of libertarian socialism and anarchism, and she provided the star which I followed,\" he says. \"She kept me on the straight and narrow and was a real influence in my life.\" </p> <p>The straight and narrow was soon to take a few twists. As an apprentice in a dental laboratory, Christie joined the Labour party Young Socialists in Glasgow, one of whose members was a young Daily Record reporter called Paul Foot. He did not linger there long. \"I was soon disillusioned with the chicanery of Labour politics, and [I was disgusted] with the executive committee going out with Rangers scarves on to make sure that the Protestant candidates were accepted.\" It was the early 60s and the US Polaris nuclear submarines had been sited at the Holy Loch. Christie joined the Scottish Committee of 100, which was dedicated to their removal and whose direct-action politics appealed. </p> <p>\"The idea of revolution was quite alive in Scotland at the time,\" he says. \"There was the political radicalisation of the 50s, satire, rock music and the collapse of the credibility of the Communist party.\" But a greater influence was Spain and the cause that had prompted many of his compatriots to join the International Brigade a quarter of a century earlier. He moved south to London where he worked as a sheet-metal apprentice and on an ironmongery stall in Shepherd's Bush. He met Spanish anarchist exiles in Bristol and decided that \"I had to do more than just demonstrate and leaflet. I offered my services.\" The mission he was assigned was to deliver explosives to Madrid for the latest attempt - the 30th, as it happened - to blow up Franco. In Paris, he met his fellow desperadoes, who were tickled when he introduced himself with the phrase, \"Zut alors!\" His limited knowledge of French had led him to believe that that was what one said in the circumstances. </p> <p>Was he frightened? \"Not really,\" he says. \"It was fun. I got an adrenaline buzz and I was doing good at the same time. No one knew. My mother thought I was grape-picking.\" He hitchhiked south, having packed his kilt, which he had found was a great way to get lifts. This was to lead to some confusion: it was reported in the Argentinian press that the man trying to kill Franco was a Scots transvestite. </p> <p>But the movement had already been heavily infiltrated, and Christie was arrested at the handover spot in Madrid, along with his Spanish contact. He was not tortured but his companion was, in front of him. He signed a confession after four days and was jailed. </p> <p>In prison, he was warmly welcomed. The anarchists sent him money, but did not want to use their own names so signed them with the only English names they knew: John, Paul, George and Ringo. The prison authorities assumed he was being funded by the Beatles. </p> <p>His incarceration prompted many protests, including from Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertrand Russell. \"I was told by the British consul that there were demonstrations all over the world. The most beneficial thing was that my arrest provided a focus for what Franco was doing. Here he was trying to pass himself off as an old avuncular gentleman on a white charger while in fact he had all these political prisoners, thousands of them who were tortured and some of them killed. The monster was growing again.\" </p> <p>One of his unlikely supporters was the late Malcolm Muggeridge, the author, journalist and television pundit who, on a programme called Why Anarchism?, had asked Christie just before his mission to Spain if he thought it was justifiable to assassinate Franco. \"I knew I was going to Spain, and here I was presenting myself as a radical revolutionary anarchist, so what could I do but say yes,\" says Christie. \"He sent me a Christmas card every year for the rest of his life.\" </p> <p>In prison he studied for A-levels in history, English and Spanish and read anarchist books smuggled into the jail. His mother wrote to Franco to ask for clemency. The Spanish authorities responded to what they described as \"her dignity and motherly concern\" and released him after three-and-a-half years. </p> <p>In London, Christie became friends with some of the people who were later to form the Angry Brigade which, in the early 70s, carried out a number of small bombing expeditions aimed at the Ted Heath government. Not entirely to his surprise, he was arrested again and faced another 20 years in jail, but at his trial at the Old Bailey he told the jury that the police had planted two detonators on him and was acquitted. </p> <p>But rearrest, he soon realised, would only be a matter of time. He moved first to Yorkshire and then to Sanday in the Orkneys, an island that had the twin advantages of a complete absence of officers of the law and a plentiful supply of Glenmorangie. </p> <p>Now married, for the next seven years he worked on local farms, ran the anarchist Cienfuegos Press and started a radical newspaper called the Free-winged Eagle. The local minister denounced him as \"the anti-Christ\" and advised his parishioners to boycott it. A degree in history and politics followed. There was a job as sub-editor for the launch of Media Week and a series of other magazine ventures which included editing the British edition of Pravda - \"I said I'd do it as long as I didn't have to join the politburo\". His past has not dogged him. \"Occasionally, I would be introduced to someone and they would say: 'You're not that Stuart Christie?' and my response is, 'You mean the west of Scotland ballroom dancing champion?' The poor guy had the same name as me.\" </p> <p>He voted for the first time in the European elections. \"I voted against Tony Blair and for Respect. The furore it caused from anarchists when it appeared on a website! The next thing, I'm getting emails from Italy saying, 'What are you doing voting?' It was because of the war primarily, but also everything else. I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck when I see Blair on television. He has subverted the good name of Scottish radicalism with the people he surrounds himself with.\" </p> <p>He is glad, after everything, that his assassination attempt was unsuccessful. \"The arrest turned out for the better. I probably did more for the cause of anti-Francoism by not killing him. There is that law of unintended consequences.\" Now he is working on a documentary about the Spanish civil war and thinking of a novel about a Scot joining the International Brigade. Current reading is Hadrian the Seventh by Baron Corvo, \"and I'm trying to plough my way through Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, an extraordinary book written in the 17th century, full of insights.\" Just like granny.</p>",
  "What drives a man to spend 80 hours strapped into a coffin-sized plane cockpit and fly around the world at up to 285 miles an hour? <p>Multimillionaire adventurer Steve Fossett says his bid to become the first person to circumnavigate the globe in a solo jet plane is not about getting his name in the record books. In any case, his name is already there, in front of a clutch of records for balloon flights. \"I do not seek celebrity or adulation - I merely seek respect,\" he says. </p> <p>Considering that, perhaps the choice of Sir Richard Branson as reserve pilot for the mission was less than low-profile. </p> <p>Both men, however, have a lot in common, sharing what Fossett calls \"a flair for doing interesting things\". </p> <p>The latest of those is the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer. Currently being tested in California's Mojave desert, it is a unique aircraft for a unique challenge.</p> <p>Taking more than four years in development, the GlobalFlyer has posed an enormous challenge for its creator, Burt Rutan, of the US aeronautical firm Scaled Composites. </p> <p>He faced the task of trying to design an aeroplane that was both light enough to get airborne while carrying the 18,000lb fuel payload needed for a 21,000 mile flight, and strong enough to withstand the buffeting of the jet stream.</p> <p>The result is a remarkable-looking craft, with three fuselages positioned along a giant 114ft wingspan. Its skin is a carbon fibre composite weighing a lot less than the metals used to make normal aircraft, and its livery is painted with a specially designed lightweight paint. </p> <p>One must-have feature for any long-distance craft - de-icing equipment - has also fallen prey to weight worries, meaning that takeoff (and more problematically, landing) must take place on a cloudless day, when there is no risk of ice forming on the body of the plane.</p> <p>The timing of the attempt, which is currently scheduled for January next year, is designed so that the craft can piggyback on jet streams, the rivers of fast-flowing air that move high up in the earth's atmosphere, helping to carry it as far and as fast as possible. </p> <p>GlobalFlyer will take off from the central US, chasing the jet stream across the Atlantic to the UK before heading south to the Mediterranean, through the Gulf, across the Pacific and back towards its start point. </p> <p>Branson will be trailing in another plane to provide support and act as a reserve pilot. He and Fossett have been here before: during the 90s, they competed against each other to become the first person to fly around the world in a balloon, eventually teaming up to attack the record and becoming friends along the way. Fossett finally succeeded, after six attempts, in 2002.</p> <p>Both men bubble over with enthusiasm about their latest mission. When Guardian Unlimited spoke to Branson, who had recently returned from a trip to Marrakesh, where he has just bought a kasbah (\"We're going to turn it into a wonderful hotel\"), he talked about the daunting feats of endurance as though he were popping to the corner shop for a pint of milk, peppering his conversation with the word \"incredible\".</p> <p>The flight will raise money for blindness prevention charity Orbis - which has longstanding links with Branson's Virgin Atlantic airline - to fund a paediatric flying eye hospital training programme in India. \"We've been involved with Orbis since it began, and one of its principal supporters. It's a flying eye hospital which goes around the world educating doctors into ways of getting people's eyesight back, and it has literally given millions of people their eyesight back,\" Branson enthuses.</p> <p>Some might argue that the \u00a31m or so spent by Virgin on GlobalFlyer might be better given directly to Orbis, but Branson is adamant about the mission's value.</p> <p>\"I think, relatively speaking, if you build a new commercial airliner you're going to be spending something like a billion pounds to achieve that,\" he says. \"This project will have cost us something like a million pounds all in. What Burt Rutan is trying to achieve is something incredibly good value for what will be an incredible achievement.\"</p> <p>The levels of endurance and single-mindedness needed to spend more than three days in a plane do not seem to trouble the adventurers either. </p> <p>Fossett, who turned 60 in April, says that - fortunately - the kind of stunts he does \"are not terribly age-limiting\". His idea of winding down after a gruelling record-breaking attempt would make most people blanch: he returned from sailing around the world with just 19 days' preparation time to run a marathon.</p> <p>The main problem he will face is staying alert for the duration of the flight. Luckily, he has plenty of experience under his belt, as Branson explains. </p> <p>\"Both of us have been in situations where we've had to be awake for over 80 hours, like our trans-Pacific balloon flight when things went horribly wrong,\" he says.</p> <p>\"It isn't easy - you can start hallucinating after 30 hours and it can be really rather unpleasant - but Steve and myself as backup will make sure that we're 100% fit and healthy before we do the trip so that we will be able to cope.</p> <p>\"There is a lot to do - you're flying this craft and it's proper flying. You're flying in the jet stream, which is very turbulent, so you're going to be very much awake.\"</p> <p>So staying awake and occupied won't be a problem - but what about the delicate issue of relieving yourself? Branson reveals that, during a previous balloon flight, he and Fossett had hit on an ingenious solution to the tricky problem of disposing of urine-filled bags. </p> <p>\"We would choose whichever countries had been unpleasant to us when we asked permission to fly over them,\" he recalls. \"I think Iraq got one load and somewhere else got another - maybe China got the other load.\"</p> <p>Urine payloads aside, there is a very real risk that something could go terribly wrong. </p> <p>GlobalFlyer will, during the course of its journey, move from being fuel laden to incredibly light, which - when added to the turbulence of the jet stream - will make for an unpredictable flight, particularly during takeoff and landing. </p> <p>As Popular Science magazine unsentimentally put it: \"If things do not go well, Fossett's flight will end in a horrific fireball.\" For once, Branson doesn't sound too displeased about putting someone else in the hotseat.</p> <p>\"Always with adventures, you have mixed feelings about them ... Steve doesn't have children and I do, and I suspect I've used up most of my nine lives over the past few years,\" he says. \"So I suspect it will most likely be a good thing if Steve ends up doing it, and not myself.\"</p> <p>The plane will have made around 35 test flights before taking to the skies for the record attempt, but Fossett says he will still be \"the ultimate test pilot\", because the plane will not have been flown with its full complement of fuel. </p> <p>However, neither man is a stranger to being rescued from remote locations. \"I think Steve's been rescued four or five times out of the sea in his life, and I've been rescued five times by helicopter so we're got experience, I'm afraid, of sea rescues,\" Branson says.</p> <p>One thing is certain: whether the mission ends in failure or success, the drama will make a great story, mark a milestone in aviation history and, not least for Branson, provide unrivalled publicity for his Virgin Atlantic brand.</p> <p>As he puts it, \"We've got wonderful stories to tell our grandchildren: incredible experiences which - if I survive them - I can share.\"</p>",
  "The home secretary, David Blunkett, was put on the back foot by the asylum controversy again yesterday when it emerged that statistics showing record numbers of immigrants may have been delayed on ministerial advice. <p>The accusation was made by MigrationWatch, whose unlikely head, the former ambassador Sir Andrew Green, claimed that the Home Office was so concerned about his activities that it had set up a unit to monitor and counter his message that immigration into Britain is out of control.</p> <p>With most opinion polls showing that asylum-related issues are important to many voters, including Labour supporters, the accusations are potentially damaging to ministers. They were reported in the Sunday Times, which has been campaigning against \"lax\" government policy.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett's Tory shadow, David Davis, was quick to protest that the Office of National Statistics (ONS) should not have asked government advice on the timing of its publication of migration data.</p> <p>According to the paperwork obtained by Sir Andrew under the access to government information code, which allows him to see what files they hold about him, an email said: \"Ministers would like us to be in a position to be able to respond to, and to be ahead of, some of the ideas, facts and figures they [the group] are promulgating ... [and] we need to form a small network of people to act in the same flexible way, fleet-of-foot way as MigrationWatch.\"</p> <p>That was not all. A proposed Home Office rebuttal in January 2003 stressed the independence of the ONS. It is a sensitive issue which has also put the statisticians at loggerheads with Tory MPs on voter-sensitive topics such as productivity levels in the NHS.</p> <p>Last September an internal email from another Home Office official said: \"ONS are asking for views on two proposals for producing the population projections...</p> <p>\"Appreciate you and press office may prefer options two [to delay publication], not least to avoid renewed attacks from MigrationWatch in the short term.\" </p> <p>That appears to suggest that the ONS was willing to delay the news that net immigration rose by 172,000 in 2001, and happened because of what was called a \"small error'.' </p> <p>The ONS was not replying to calls yesterday. But the Home Office said it was \"common practice\" to brief ministers on potentially \"inaccurate or misleading\" claims, so that an honest public debate could occur. </p> <p>\"The Home Office regularly monitors estimates and statistics by organisations such as MigrationWatch and in the media,\" a spokesman said. \"We believe MigrationWatch has produced statistics that give an over-inflated picture of levels of migration, and this is damaging to public confidence.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis told the Sunday Times: \"It is wholly wrong of the ONS to seek instructions. It just shouldn't be offering those options. An independent statistical organisation shouldn't be seeking any views on when to publish.\" </p> <p>Both sides leapt on a claim that a new version of Sangatte refugee camp, closed last year at Mr Blunkett's instigation, has been allowed near the Channel tunnel at Calais. </p> <p>\"This is not a second Sangatte, which was an official camp providing shelter, food and facilities to up to 1,500 people while they attempted to gain illegal entry into the UK,\" the Home Office said. </p> <p>\"Since the home secretary secured closure of Sangatte there have frequently been small numbers of people who have slept rough while trying to jump on the back of lorries bound for the UK. We continue to work closely with the French authorities to enforce border controls.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett, who is on holiday abroad, has dismissed MigrationWatch as a \"tinpot\" organisation, but is acutely aware of the way that inflammatory claims, true and false, made tabloid headlines. </p> <p>He wants what officials call a \"more rationale debate\" on the issue, not least the case for the \"managed migration\" of people whose skills, and youth, may be needed.</p>",
  "The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, is due to arrive in Khartoum today to add to the diplomatic pressure on the Sudanese government to stop the suffering of its people in the Darfur region. <p>The latest UN estimate is that 600 people a day are dying, despite a huge international relief effort. </p> <p>Although the British government officially does not rule out western military intervention, London wants the African Union to increase its monitoring force from 420 to 3,000, and widen its mandate. </p> <p>The UN security council has set a deadline of August 30 for the Sudanese government to rein in the Arab Janjaweed militia largely held responsible for the killing and flight of African villagers from their land. But the council is divided and its likeliest response at present is a further month's extension. </p> <p>Mr Straw is due to see the Sudanese foreign minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, tonight, and visit one of the biggest refugee camps in Darfur, Abu Shouk, tomorrow. </p> <p>About 1.2 million people have fled their homes in the face of attacks by the Janjaweed. </p> <p>A British official said the crisis had been exacerbated by the slow start of the aid operation and its initial obstruction by the Sudanese government. </p> <p>\"We are not in as good a position as we would have liked to be,\" he said. The UN says food aid is getting to only about 65% of those in need. </p> <p>Another British official said that it was difficult to know whether the Sudanese had done enough to avoid UN sanctions. It had taken some steps, but in other areas there was no evidence that it was trying to comply with the requirements set by the UN security council. </p> <p>As a compromise, Khartoum gave the UN an undertaking at the weekend that the refugees would be not be forced to return to their homes. </p> <p>The refugees have been protesting that the Sudanese security forces have been trying to round them up and take them back to villages still under threat from Arab militia. </p> <p>Mr Straw will remind the Sudanese government of a series of promises it has made to the UN general secretary, Kofi Annan, and will say that it is time to honour them. He will express concern that it has failed to make a significant effort to deal with the Janjaweed. </p> <p>A British official said: \"I don't think we are yet seeing compelling evidence that known perpetrators within the reach of the government of Sudan are being brought to justice, and that is clearly something that we do want to see.\" </p> <p>Nor was the Sudanese government guaranteeing security in and around the refugee camps, the official said. On the plus side, however, it had significantly eased restrictions on access to Darfur by aid agencies. </p> <p>Although Tony Blair has hinted that Britain may be prepared to intervene militarily, neither the US nor the EU intends to send troops, and Britain is equally reluctant. </p> <p>Instead, the UK is banking on the African Union, which sent about 150 Rwandan soldiers to Darfur last week in support of 120 monitors. Some 150 troops from Nigeria are due to join them this week. Nigeria has suggested a figure of 3,000 AU monitors. The UK government would like to see troops sent from Arab North Africa as well, which would be more acceptable to Sudan's Arabic-speaking government.</p>",

But we will look at the case once it is filed.\" </p> <p>Paul Hamm should not have been given first place and Yang should have won gold not bronze, the gymnastics governing body FIG admitted. Yet the American was allowed to keep his medal. Three judges were suspended, including an American. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Najah Ali, Iraq's only Olympic boxer, went out of the competition in the second round on Saturday. He was outpointed 24-11 by Armenia's Aleksan Nalbandyan but the crowd was won over, chanting \"Ali! Ali!\" in the final round. The light-flyweight was then swept up in a bear hug by his coach Maurice \"Termite\" Watkins, a former used car salesman from Texas who is contracted by the US army in Iraq as a pest controller. </p> <p>Ali celebrated with ice cream. \"I wouldn't let him eat it before,\" Watkins said. \"I'm pretty tough. I'm not quite as tough as Uday but I'll cut the ice cream off.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Matt Emmons missed out on a second gold medal when he shot at the wrong target. The American, who had won the 50-metre prone rifle event on Friday, held a commanding lead after nine of the 10 shots in the 50-metre three-position rifle yesterday, but his final shot from lane two hit the target in lane three, scoring him no points and dropping him to eighth. Jia Zhanbo of China took the gold medal.</p>",
  "<p>When Paula Radcliffe travelled from the Olympic village along the road from Athens to Marathon ready for the start of the biggest race of her life she must have feared the worst. </p> <p>Temperatures peaked at 100F, making this the warmest day of the year in the Greek capital, and the road was hot enough to fry an egg on. Even taking a walk to buy an ice cream was exhausting, let alone trying to run 26.2 miles. </p> <p>\"The heat was too much for her to overcome,\" said David Bedford, the former world record holder for the 10,000 metres and now race director of the London marathon. </p> <p>\"This was a beast of a course, even on a good day, but these women were given the most testing of conditions,\" said Steve Cram, the former world record holder for the mile. \"It was much hotter and drier than it had been, which made things very difficult.\" </p> <p>Radcliffe had been among those runners who had campaigned to the International Association of Athletics Federations for the race to begin at 6am, but their views were ignored. </p> <p>The Bedford runner drank at every opportunity, taking her own specially prepared drinks and mineral water. </p> <p>\"Once you are in these conditions, it is a complete surprise,\" said Dr Clive Williams, a sports science professor. \"It feels like you are running in warm water.\" </p> <p>Among those to pass Radcliffe as she sat sobbing on the side of the road was the bronze medallist Deena Kastor, an American who had never beaten her before. </p> <p>Before coming to Athens Kastor had been advised by Dr David Martin, an expert in many running areas, one of them being performance in hot environments. </p> <p>\"Getting ready for any marathon is a multifaceted job,\" said Martin. \"There are a lot of things you have to do right. In Athens, with the the heat and the tough course, it's basically a marathon that requires more facets than most. </p> <p>\"Dehydration will be a major problem. The runners will be sweating a litre, maybe 1.5l, or even more per hour, but it's difficult to drink more than half a litre per hour.\" </p> <p>Kastor used a solution called glycerol to help her combat the problem. \"It's fatty acid that occurs naturally in the human system, and it's not on any banned lists,\" said Martin. </p> <p>\"It helps your tissues take on more water before a race, and you don't pee it out. In a marathon like Athens, every little bit of extra fluid on board helps.\" </p> <p>Just before the race Radcliffe wore a specially designed Nike pre-cool vest for 30 minutes to keep her body temperature low. </p> <p>But Martin thinks this may have been nothing more than a gimmick. \"I don't understand why they should help,\" he said. \"The whole idea seems counter-intuitive to me. </p> <p>\"We've known for years that the muscle enzymes work best when the muscles heat up to 101F or so. That's why everyone believes in warming up before a race. Now people are talking about cooling down before a race. I don't follow the logic.\" </p> <p>Martin has visited the course on several occasions and produced a dossier on it that was distributed to the US marathon runners, including Kastor. </p> <p>\"Everyone heard that the Athens course is hard, but not everyone realised how the hills come at you,\" said Martin. \"They come in a succession of waves.\" </p> <p>Mizuki Noguchi, who won gold with a solo breakaway, had run the Olympic course in June, and then went to train at altitude in St Moritz, where she had practised hill running. </p> <p>Perhaps Radcliffe, for all her work, had stinted on this aspect of her preparation. Liz Yelling, her friend and former training partner who finished 25th yesterday, said: \"Maybe she underestimated the course. It was a lot harder than I thought.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"No one remembers who came fourth,\" Paula Radcliffe said on another night of sadness and the same thought seemed to be on her mind as she stumbled to a halt opposite the 36km sign by the side of a road on the outskirts of Athens last night. She had just looked across the road and seen the green vest of Elfenesh Alemu ghosting past her. </p> <p>Twilight was falling as the Ethiopian woman eased away. With an action that made it look as though she had been running since the dawn of time and yet was hardly running at all, Alemu had taken third place from the straining Radcliffe. She had taken the bronze-medal position. And in Radcliffe's mind at that moment nothing else was worth running for. </p> <p>So she stopped. With a terrible distress written on her face she turned and bent down and put her hands on her knees and looked back down the road. Then she straightened up and started running again. </p> <p>If she could have heard the roar that greeted her attempt to resume the contest from the thousands of her supporters gathered less than five miles away in the Panathinaiko stadium, watching events unfold on a giant screen, perhaps she would have thought better of stopping again a few yards later. But in that moment she was alone with her bewilderment. The spectators lining the road could offer her nothing except silent sympathy. And so, after a handful of strides, she stopped again, sat down on the grass verge and wept. </p> <p>Eventually she was picked up and taken to the medical centre and put on a saline drip. But it was hard to avoid the conclusion that her supreme effort to win gold had been halted not by the heat, not by exhaustion, not by the effect of some unacknowledged injury, but by sheer crushing disappointment. </p> <p>The pressure of expectations, hers and ours, had been too much. Somehow she had driven herself into a corner from which she could emerge only with a medal around her neck. All that living at altitude, all that finely judged dieting, all those ice baths and deep massages, even the world records and the endorsements and the awards, suddenly they meant nothing. </p> <p>Mizuki Noguchi of Japan won the race, after making a courageous solo break from the leading group at the 15-mile mark and gradually pulling her lengthening shadow clear of the pursuers. Her time of 2hr 26min 20sec was five minutes outside her personal best and 11 minutes off Radcliffe's world record but it represented a wonderful performance in a race that took place in temperatures above 35C (95F). Catherine Ndereba of Kenya chased her home, 12 seconds in arrears, and Deena Kastor of the United States made a remarkable late challenge to deprive Alemu of the bronze, crossing the line exactly a minute behind the winner. </p> <p>Radcliffe's inability to finish the race was a sadness to the thousands of British fans who had gathered to welcome her in the beautiful Panathinaiko stadium. The first spectators were allowed to enter an hour before the race was due to start, 26 miles away. They had each paid \u20ac10 (\u00a36.77) for an unreserved place on the 50 tiers of marble benches. Most chose to seat themselves on the north-west side of the stadium, profiting from the shade that would gradually lengthen as the afternoon progressed and as the runners, far out of sight, made their way through the sun-blasted streets. </p> <p>Union jacks were in a vast majority, interspersed with the occasional Japanese, Australian, German, French, Greek and Welsh flag, many used as informal sunshades as the spectators settled down to wait. The flags of all 202 nations competing in the 2004 games flew around the rim, set against a ring of trees. At the stadium's open end the greenery of the National Gardens filled in the view, surmounted by distant hills. </p> <p>At the mouth of the tunnel, through which the athletes emerged to contest the first of these modern games back in 1896, a team of parademics waited with three gurneys to greet the survivors of the field of 85 runners. Inside the tunnel seven static beds had been set up, with curtains and saline drips, and three wheelchairs nearby. </p> <p>Radcliffe, as has always been her way, took the lead as the field left the village of Marathon, five miles inland from the Aegean sea. A group of a dozen runners formed around her, initially including three Japanese runners and three Ethiopians. As the course climbed gradually to a peak of 770 feet above sea level in the village of Stavros, the group was winnowed down. </p> <p>The cheers came regularly in the stadium as the screen showed Radcliffe retaining the lead, her stride long and her head undulating. At half distance there was no indication that anything might be amiss. </p> <p>Noguchi's break came as the group was reforming while moving away from one of the drinks stations positioned every couple of kilometres. When Alemu went with her, Radcliffe threw off her pale blue baseball cap and seemed to be struggling for air as the gap to the front two quickly grew to 20 yards. </p> <p>There were six miles left and the runners were entering the city streets when Noguchi dropped Alemu, opening a 30-second lead. Radcliffe accelerated and closed the gap to the Ethiopian, cheers ringing round the stadium as she retook second place. But the black-clad Ndereba, a member of the original leading group, had been quietly closing and, when she passed Radcliffe, there was no response. For the world record holder the denouement was not far away. </p> <p>The applause that should have been hers went instead to her team-mates Liz Yelling and Tracey Morris as they entered the stadium to finish 25th and 29th. </p> <p>\"I know how hard Paula tried, how much dedication she put in, how many sacrifices she made,\" Yelling said. \"Maybe she underestimated the course.\" </p> <p>\"No one remembers who came fourth,\" Radcliffe had cried in frustration and anguish at the Olympic Games four years ago as she watched the first three finishers in the 10,000m go off to collect their medals. But she was wrong. A nation has never forgotten the character she showed that night and on others when admiration was the only reward for her talent and resolution. Last night, sadly, she did not even give herself the chance.</p>",
  "Over the past 12 months, Gordon Brown and others have had ample opportunity to force Tony Blair out. They could have joined Robin Cook in resigning on the eve of the war in Iraq. They could have moved in May and June when the prime minister seemed on the ropes. They were either unwilling or unable to act. In short, they blew it. They bottled. <p>Blair has survived his ordeal - a botched war, rebellions over public service reform, and half-challenges from his chancellor - and is likely to emerge more confident than he has been for two years. He is back where he was originally, in a position to determine the time and manner of his departure. </p> <p>With Westminster gearing up for the new political season, the question the left must ask itself is: if it cannot replace him, can it influence him? Will Labour MPs go into the next election with a manifesto that bears only a passing resemblance to what many understand as radicalism? Will Blair's eventual successor be locked into pledges in which he has little faith? </p> <p>On one level, there is cause for gloom. And yet Blair is the first to appreciate that, with voters as unpredictable as they are, the election is not in the bag. In order to entice them to turn out, he has to entice his own grassroots to campaign. </p> <p>To do that, a truce has to be called. The terms of engagement have to change. Blair has belatedly to acknowledge some mistakes over Iraq. His critics should then agree, as the boss would say, to \"move on\". This would be an imperfect solution, but better than none. The crucial stage in the healing process is a debate, a serious one, about ideas. This will be hard for a leader who sees his party as a vehicle for action rather than discussion. </p> <p>The national policy forum at the end of July demonstrated again the gap between rhetoric and reality. Blair's speech was entitled \"Winning the Battle of Ideas\". It is a victory by default, because the battle is fought only within extremely tight parameters. Many people simply do not engage. </p> <p>Mainstream critics within the party define themselves by what they are against. Some, like Neal Lawson, whose farewell to Blairism in these columns caused quite a stir, are tentatively putting together an alternative manifesto for social democracy. But whether they are officially sought by Downing Street, which put out an SOS to thinktanks shortly before the policy forum, or whether they come from outside, ideas are still thin on the ground. \"We are in desperate need of inspiration,\" says one minister. </p> <p>Do not hold your breath. Certainly do not look to the party conference, a study in choreography, for signs of compromise. If concessions to the party are made, it will happen behind closed doors. But MPs and ministers I have spoken to over the past few days, those who would fall into the category of loyal but frustrated, argue that if Blair wants to galvanise Labour-inclined voters next year he will have to offer more than the promises of crime crackdowns and a more individualised National Health Service and school system. </p> <p>They point to several areas. Quality of life issues have risen up the scale of priorities. The Blairite solution is typically triangulated. It focuses on increasing nursery places and improving childcare provision, on enhancing maternity and paternity rights, all admirable in themselves, while doing little to threaten the hegemony of the boardroom or to remove the atmosphere of wage slavery. </p> <p>Leaving aside France's 35-hour week (the debate is raging there on its merits), the government - through its obsession with global competitiveness - is failing to keep pace with voters. Blair friend and foe alike have much to do on family and work, as they do on the whole agenda of public service reform. The debate so far has revolved around over-simplified concepts such as \"choice\" and individualisation. </p> <p>As for issues around equity and poverty, there is still an argument to be had on a fairer distribution of income and assets, taking us beyond the somewhat stale debate on income tax rates. The left is in dire need of updating its thinking. </p> <p>There are several other areas where the left could be making the running. On law and order it has to engage on antisocial behaviour - there is little denying its importance to voters - but it need not be along the crime first, causes second lines of Blair and David Blunkett. The same goes for asylum and immigration. It is easy to attack the government for its ugly populist lunges, but where is the contrary prescription that combines fairness for those in need with the welfare and security requirements of voters? </p> <p>And what of the original \"new politics\" agenda of 1997? Blairites embraced the hopes of more open and accountable politics with equal ardour. Progress has been pitifully slow, in some areas non-existent. Fairer voting for Westminster elections is as elusive as ever. House of Lords reform has made little progress. Commons reform has been minimal. Some power may be devolved to regional government. But more importantly, the early emphasis on individual liberty through the incorporation of the human rights convention has been emasculated by excesses such as the detention without trial of the Belmarsh Twelve. Reconciling civil liberties with the threat posed by terrorism is vital for the left. </p> <p>Blair has raised the white flag to the sceptics at the first sign of trouble with the EU. If the constitution and \"social Europe\" are so unthreatening to social democrats abroad, why is a better case not made here? Cook's vow to introduce an ethical dimension to foreign policy was mocked by Blair, who saw no need to curb arms sales or change the government's traditionally selective approach to human rights abuses. </p> <p>This is fertile ground for the left. But on the most burning issue of all, intervention, it has to formulate its own approach. If Blair was wrong on Iraq, is it ever right to send British forces into action? And if so, on what terms? There can be no more important issue for internationalists than that. </p> <p>Blair says with his characteristic disdain that the Labour party has \"given up the luxury of criticism for the obligation of decision\". He is in part right. For criticism to carry weight, it has to be backed by a persuasive alternative vision. Otherwise Labour will have to put up with its current leader and his minimalist vision of the future for some time to come. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Kampfner is political editor of the New Statesman and author of Blair's Wars</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jkampfner.net\">www.jkampfner.net</a></p>",
  "The father of a murdered British backpacker was last night preparing to fly to Thailand to recover his son's body and help uncover the circumstances surrounding his death. <p>Mark Lemetti, 24, was found battered to death in a rubber plantation in southern Thailand in the early hours of Friday. His attack was so brutal, police investigators were unable to identify him. </p> <p>Days before his death, Mr Lemetti had been in touch with his parents via email as he did regularly, detailing his trip through south-east Asia over the past five weeks and confirming he was due to arrive home shortly. </p> <p>Thai police believe Mark was robbed for his mobile phone and then beaten to death with a snooker cue which was found next to his body. </p> <p>He may have known his attacker, with some local media reports suggesting the man police have arrested was a tour guide who was seen with Mr Lemetti at a pool hall on the evening before he died. </p> <p>As his father, Roland, prepared to fly to Thailand a family member said they were waiting for word from officials to see when he could leave. </p> <p>\"The family are all in a state of shock, they are very upset,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Mark was backpacking on his own. He'd been away for four or five weeks and was nearing the end of his tour.\" </p> <p>Scots-born Mark had travelled through Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia. </p> <p>\"He had an honours degree in ecology and was very interested in the environment - that's why he was out there. Everyone is shocked by what has happened. Mark was a very nice boy, well spoken and quite intellectual, really nice.\" </p> <p>It was still not clear whether he had been killed elsewhere and dumped in the plantation or lured out of town on the pretext of a tour and then killed, police officials said. </p> <p>A worker found his body lying in a rubber plantation in the Sungai Kolok district, in the province of Narathiwat, 750 miles from Bangkok. </p> <p>On Saturday, police arrested a Pakistani man, Useng Makbu, 32, after a witness reported seeing him with Mr Lemetti shortly before the killing. </p> <p>The man made a dramatic attempt to flee, according to police. </p> <p>He climbed on to the roof of his house in the Sungai Kolok district, and ran across the rooftop. </p> <p>The roof caved in under his weight and he fell, injuring himself and needinghospital treatment. </p> <p>On searching his home, police found Mr Lemetti's camera, mobile phone, shoes, toiletries and a document which had belonged to him. </p> <p>Local media reports have identified the suspect as Mah-ae Brahim. </p> <p>The suspect has been charged with murder, theft and living in Thailand without proper documentation and faces the death penalty by lethal injection. </p> <p>\"He has denied the charges,\" a police spokesman said. \"But we have found most of Mark's belongings in his house. Mark's passport showed he had been to Thailand before. He may have been doing a visa run. </p> <p>We do not believe his story that Mark entrusted his belongings to him for safekeeping.\" </p> <p>The Foreign Office has warned against travelling to this area of Thailand after terrorist attacks and civil unrest. </p> <p>There were three bomb blasts there at the weekend. </p> <p>Mr Lemetti is the first westerner to be killed in the area since the unrest started in January. </p> <p>But police say there is no terrorist link to his death and they believe the motive was robbery.</p>"
