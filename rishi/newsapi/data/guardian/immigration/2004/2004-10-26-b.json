  "A specific criminal offence of forcing someone into marriage will be created under proposals to be published today by the Home Office. <p>The announcement is part of a package of measures intended to curb a cultural practice which affects girls as young as 13. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, is also to introduce immigration rules which will see the minimum age for those coming to Britain to marry raised from 16 to 18 in an attempt to help teenagers resist family pressure to marry without their consent. </p> <p>A Foreign Office community liaison unit, set up in 2000 to tackle the problem, has dealt with more than 1,000 cases in the past three years. </p> <p>The unit has helped to rescue and repatriate about 200 young people who had been brought to Britain mainly from Pakistan and Bangladesh. </p> <p>Ministers will make it clear that the measures are not aimed at curbing arranged marriages. They say that although the families of the two partners often take a leading role in an arranged marriage, the final decision is left to the spouses. </p> <p>A recent government working party found that although the victims of forced marriages can use the law to nullify their partnerships, in practice they rarely know about such provisions or are unable to use them. The law can only be used within the first three years of marriage and family pressure often prevents this. Attempts have been made to use the laws of rape, false imprisonment and kidnapping to deal with the problem. </p> <p>Ministers want to consult on whether a specific offence of forcing someone into marriage will help to deal with the problem.</p>",
  "<b> Times</b> <br> Editorial, October 26 <p> \"It is ... bizarre that the government should now be preparing to drop its veto on asylum and immigration issues within the EU with barely any explanation and little attempt to forestall the outcry that Britain is surrendering sovereignty on an issue of crucial social and political importance ... </p> <p>\"Labour obviously fears that any talk of majority voting on asylum will be seized on by the Conservatives as a surrender to 'Europe', stoking anti-EU feeling. The precedent could weaken Labour's stand against majority voting on tax, foreign policy and defence.

The reality of course is that far from opting out, Britain will come under enormous pressure to sign up to any new laws and gradually become part of a single immigration and asylum system ... Could there be a more telling illustration of New Labour's contempt for our democratic tradition than this almost casual transfer of power to Brussels?\" </p> <p><b> Daily Star</b><br> Editorial, October 26 </p> <p> \"[The home secretary] says we'll still be able to opt out of any legislation that is not in our interest.

  "<p>Rudyard Kipling's cat who walked alone had the right idea. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh have found that the pressures of shared living bring sensitive felines down with stress-related illness. The biggest source of anxiety is a rival cat in the house, but moving home, the arrival of a baby and not venturing outside were stressful. </p> <p>Danielle Gunn-Moore of the university's school of veterinary studies said: \"The neighbour's dog barking or the postman arriving on a Thursday isn't particularly stressful. We're looking at longer term stress and the classic source is living with a cat with which they don't get on.\" </p> <p>The relentless anxiety overstimulates nerves leading from the cat's brain to its bladder and provokes cystitis. </p> <p>Up to 60% of cases of the feline bladder condition seen by vets show no obvious cause, but a similar problem in people is linked to stress. \"We believed stress could be a trigger and wanted to identify differences in the cats' environments and temperaments which might cause this condition,\" Dr Gunn-Moore said. </p> <p>Her team compared 31 cats with bladder disease brought to the university's hospital for small animals to 24 healthy animals from the same households and a separate control group of 125 healthy cats. They found animals with a diseased bladder were more likely to be in conflict with a housemate. The results appear in the Journal of Small Animal Practice. </p> <p>\"In a household situation often a dominant cat will camp out on the stairs and prevent another, more timid one from coming past,\" she said. </p> <p>Other sources of anxiety included not venturing outside, having owners who worked night shifts and left their pets alone, and obnoxious children. One cat was made ill by the constant noise from low flying aircraft. </p> <p>The experts recommend that cats with the stress-related condition should be fed wet food and encouraged to drink more water, perhaps by adding tuna-flavoured ice cubes.</p>",
  "China's population, already the largest in the world, will peak at 1.46 billion in 30 years, straining the country's healthcare system, putting pressure on jobs, and gobbling up a greater share of the world's food and energy resources. <p>The demographic forecast was made by the nation's family planning chief, who said the country's one-child policy would not lead to a reduction in overall numbers until the mid-2030s. </p> <p>Zhang Weiqing, director of the state population and family planning commission, told a symposium in Shanghai over the weekend that the number of people living in China would continue to rise by 10 million a year. \"This will pose a serious challenge to our social security system,\" he said. </p> <p>The biggest short-term threat is of destabilising unemployment as millions are added to the workforce every year until 2020, when the working age population will peak at 940 million. </p> <p>Despite an annual growth rate of more than 9% for the past 20 years, China is struggling to provide jobs for the surge of new graduates, migrant labourers, and former employees of defunct state-run factories. The government and labour activists report a rising number of protests by laid-off workers. </p> <p>When this problem starts to ebb, a new one will arise in the form on a sharp increase in the elderly population. </p> <p>Citing demographic peaks as the \"toughest challenge for China's sustainable development,\" Mr Zhang said the population suffered from low quality as well as high quantity. He was referring to poverty, low education, Aids, and a growing gender imbalance. </p> <p>The government estimates that 144 million migrant work ers have already flocked from the country to the city. Another 300 million peasants are expected to move into urban areas by 2020. Fearing a lack of people to care for the growing elderly population, Shanghai relaxed its regulations this year to allow certain couples to have two children. </p> <p>But Mr Zhang said there would be no changes at a national level to the strict family planning policy. The government credits the one-child policy with trimming overall population growth by about 300 million births over the past 10 years, creating space for economic expansion. </p> <p>If current trends continue, the United Nations Population Fund predicts the number of people in China will rise and then fall to 1.39 billion by 2050, by which time it will have been overtaken as the world's most populous nation by India, forecast to have 1.6 billion people by mid-century.</p>",
  "<p>Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian-born steel magnate, yesterday staked a claim to overtake Roman Abramovich as Britain's richest man with a \u00a310bn deal to create the world's largest steelmaker. It will see his family pick up a \u00a31bn-plus dividend. </p> <p>Ispat International, where Mr Mittal has a 77% holding, is buying the Mittal family's privately owned steel group LNM for $13.3bn (\u00a37.1bn) and the Ohio-based steelmaker International Steel group for $4.5bn. </p> <p>The new group will have around 165,000 employees in 14 countries and an estimated stock market value of more than $20bn. The Mittal family will hold around 88% of the shares which will be listed on the New York and Euronext exchanges. </p> <p>Earlier this year Mr Mittal, who was born in Rajasthan, was ranked as Britain's fifth richest man in the Sunday Times rich list with a fortune put at \u00a33.5bn. Yesterday's deal means it is now well ahead of that figure. As a result, Mr Mittal could be challenging Mr Abramovich, the oil billionaire and Chelsea football club owner, who is said to be worth \u00a37.5bn, at the top of the list. </p> <p>Mr Mittal, who began his working life in the family's steel-making business, has built his fortune by buying up out-of-favour steel assets, often as part of government privatisation programmes. </p> <p>His first big success came in Mexico and was followed by deals in countries such as Kazakhstan, South Africa, Indonesia, Algeria, Poland, the Czech Republic, France and Germany. \"He has been prepared to go to countries other steelmakers wouldn't touch,\" said one analyst. </p> <p>But his progress has not been without controversy. In 2001 he became mired in a row over a \u00a3125,000 donation to Labour just before winning Tony Blair's support for his successful bid for Romania's biggest steelmaker. </p> <p>Mr Mittal, who lives in London, is married with a son, Aditya, who will be chief financial officer of the new group, and a daughter, Vanisha. He recently paid a reported \u00a370m for a house near Kensington Palace. </p> <p>Whether or not he overtakes Mr Abramovich in the rich list, his new company, Mittal Steel will overtake Arcelor, itself the merger of France's Usinor, Luxembourg's Arbed and Spain's Aceralia, as the world's leader in steel production.</p>",
  "Ariel Sharon opened a bitter debate in parliament yesterday over his plan to remove Jewish settlers from Gaza by saying it paves the way towards a Palestinian state while strengthening Israel's grip over its West Bank colonies. <p>Mr Sharon was repeatedly interrupted and heckled as he defended the \"disengagement plan\" ahead of a vote today that is expected to split his ruling Likud party and force a realignment of Israeli politics. </p> <p>\"I learned from experience that one cannot be victorious by the sword alone. We do not wish to rule forever over millions of Palestinians whose population is doubling every generation. Israel wishes to be a democracy and cannot do it. The disengagement is a gateway to another reality,\" the prime minister said. </p> <p>\"I am absolutely determined to implement this measure to the bitter end. I am absolutely convinced that this disengagement will strengthen Israel in its control over the territory which is vital for our survival, for our continued existence.\" </p> <p>Israeli politicians interpreted Mr Sharon's oblique reference to vital territory as meaning the main West Bank settlements which he has long championed as a crucial part of the country's defence. </p> <p>Hours earlier, Israeli forces killed at least 14 Palestinians, including an 11-year-old boy, two policemen and several armed men, in a tank and missile raid on Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza. At least 70 people were wounded, many of them civilians. </p> <p>The army said the operation was aimed at curbing rocket attacks on the neighbouring Gush Katif Jewish settlements, but Palestinians said the timing suggested an attempt by the government to influence the debate in parliament. </p> <p>Mr Sharon opened the session on his plan to dismantle all 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and four small ones in the West Bank by praising the settlers but warning that some, who stake a biblical claim to the land, had developed a Messianic complex. </p> <p>He described the decision to shut the Gaza settlements as the most difficult of his career and said he felt responsible for the settlers because he was instrumental in encouraging them to live in there, but he denied misleading them. </p> <p>Mr Sharon pointedly said that his unilateral strategy is not a replacement for the US-led \"road map\" following comments earlier this month by his chief aide, Dov Weisglass, who said the disengagement strategy was designed to freeze peace talks and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. </p> <p>\"The disengagement plan is no substitute for negotiations nor does it wish to have a complete stalemate forever,\" the prime minister the prime minister said. </p> <p>But a reference by Mr Sharon to \"dividing up the land, the [occupied] territories\" confirmed that he has not shifted from his desire to solidify Israel's control over 120 settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem that are home to about 420,000 Jews while carving out an emasculated Palestinian homeland on the rest of the territory. </p> <p>Three MPs were ejected from the chamber for heckling Mr Sharon, including Uri Ariel. \"You are tearing the nation apart. Go home. You must not expel Jews,\" he shouted at the prime minister. </p> <p>Thousands of settlers and their supporters plan to ring the parliament today to protest against the vote. </p> <p>Mr Sharon is likely to win the vote on the plan but as many as half of his own party's MPs will oppose it, forcing him to rely on the opposition Labour party to push it through.</p>",
  "The artist Fermin Rocker, who has died aged 96, was one of the last links with the heroic era of European and American anarchism, which faded beyond hope of revival with the Spanish civil war. The younger son of the anarchist thinker and writer Rudolf Rocker, one of the last anarchists of international renown, Fermin was certainly the last person alive who remembered the brief but remarkable flowering of anarchism as a mass movement among the Yiddish-speaking migrants of London's East End, a movement all but snuffed out by the turbulence of the first world war and the countervailing attractions of the Russian revolution. <p>Fermin was greatly in awe of his father, whose tousled hair, goatee beard and corpulent frame featured in many of his early drawings and paintings. \"I looked upon him as a god,\" he wrote years later. So did many others. Rudolf Rocker was a German gentile who came to live among migrant Jews, learned Yiddish, and became an inspirational teacher and leader to a marginalised community deeply suspicious of authority, and yearning for a voice, a means of securing self-respect, and a path to education and advancement. </p> <p>The craft trade unions which Rudolf Rocker nurtured and encouraged, and the lively anarchist journals he and his colleagues published, notably the Arbaiter Fraind (The Workers' Friend), won a large following among the victims of pogroms and oppression who crowded into Stepney and Whitechapel in the years before 1914. Fermin's Russian-born mother, Milly Witcop, was also a revolutionary, one of four Jewish sisters, three of whom were prominent either as anarchists or militant feminists. </p> <p>Fermin was born in London and named after a prominent Spanish anarchist. He grew up in a tenement block in Stepney in an intensely political environment, captured with delightful irreverence in his memoir, The East End Years: A Stepney Childhood, published by the long-established anarchist imprint, Freedom Press, in 1998. As a small boy, he got to know and admire such leftwing luminaries as Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta (\"a loveable little fellow\"), sat up through long meetings in the hope that his father would tell him a bedtime story and was taken to the Jubilee Street Club, the epicentre of East End Jewish radicalism, where he used to filch paper on which to draw. </p> <p>\"There was hope in the air, an anticipation of better things to come,\" Fermin recalled. \"In later years my father would look back at it with profound nostalgia and regret. It was a time, he insisted, that still had aspirations and ideals, that still had visions of a better future, of a world more just and humane. No one dreamt what horrors the century had in store for us, what despair and disillusionment it would bring.\" </p> <p>With the first world war came repression. Rudolf Rocker was interned in Alexandra Palace, north London. Fermin remembered visiting him there. His mother was also arrested. The family was reunited in Amsterdam in 1918, moving on to Germany, where Fermin first mixed with artists and began to draw and paint. </p> <p>Then, in 1929 - with the decline of the Weimar Republic - he moved to New York. A few years later his parents followed, settling in a rural commune in New York state. </p> <p>Fermin's art was influenced by the realist school, though he was always too much of an individualist to be saddled with an easy label. He worked in New York as a draughtsman, a cartoon animator, a commercial artist, and then for many years as a book illustrator. Times were often tough. From the 1950s, he turned increasingly to oil painting, developing a hallmark style - precise, in a minor key and with a limited palette, portraying human activity (a meeting, or musical performance, or busy city street) but with each individual cocooned, isolated, even while in a common endeavour. </p> <p>His first one-man exhibition was in New York in 1944, but it was only after returning to London in 1972, with his American wife, Ruth Robins, that he began to make a living from painting. From the mid-1980s, he had a succession of successful shows, notably at the Stephen Bartley Gallery in Chelsea. He became, to some degree, and late in his life, fashionable (Mick Jagger once called round to select a canvas) - though that never influenced his art, which, in style and tone, felt as if it belonged to an earlier era. </p> <p>Few of his themes were directly political. The painting bought by Jagger, depicting a mass of Basque refugees heading away from the devastation wrought by Franco's allies towards the French border, is something of an exception. </p> <p>While standing broadly within the anarchist tradition, Fermin was impatient of its feuds, and critical of the left's reluctance to engage with the modern world and to accept that capitalism has improved lives and living standards. But some anarchists regarded Fermin almost as a crown prince. His son, Philip - who cared for him in his closing years - was always amused that the anarchist paper Freedom arrived unbidden in the mailbox. </p> <p>Fermin continued to paint in his top-floor flat in London's Tufnell Park until his last few weeks. He died peacefully in his own bed. Just 24 hours later, more than 100 admirers and well-wishers gathered at the Chambers Gallery in London's Smithfield for the private view of his first retrospective (which continues there until November 14). His wife died in 1989; he is survived by Philip. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Fermin Rocker, artist, born December 22 1907; died October 18 2004</p>",
  "Sebastian (Bas) Pease, who has died aged 81, was a distinguished physicist and a remarkable man. The director of Britain's fusion research programme at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) for many years, he was a leading member of the Pugwash Group, the international movement of scientists concerned about the social impact and misuse of science. <p>His scientific expertise and social conscience echoed his family background, with its Quaker roots. His paternal grandfather, Edward Reynolds Pease, was a co-founder of the Fabian Society and of the Labour Party. His father was a geneticist, while his mother was the daughter of Josiah C Wedgwood, who became a member of the first Labour Cabinet. Pease was educated in the stimulating and liberal atmosphere of Bedales school and took a degree in physics at Trinity College, Cambridge. </p> <p>In 1942, he joined the operational research unit at the headquarters of RAF bomber command, High Wycombe, where he worked on the development of \"blind\" bombing equipment and the use of aluminium \"window\" foil to deceive the German radars over the location of the D-day landings. He moved to the general physics division at Harwell in 1947 to work on solid-state research, producing some of the classic work on radiation damage and neutron diffraction. </p> <p>His main work on controlled nuclear fusion started in 1955, when, still at Harwell, he became leader of the physics research section, and later came to play a leading role in the Zeta (Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly) research team, which worked on the containment of hot plasma in a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) magnetic field. (When the results of his work there were published, the Daily Mail placed him on its shortlist of the most attractive men in the world.) </p> <p>The British fusion programme's work was transferred to Culham, Oxfordshire, in 1964, where he became division head and later, in 1967, director of the Culham Laboratory. Budget cuts and difficult times followed, but he managed to ensure that Culham maintained a broadly based fusion programme, including the initiation of a programme of commercial research in which Culham's skills were put to the needs of industry. </p> <p>Notwithstanding the cold war, Pease collaborated with Russian fusion experts, which was crucial in establishing the credibility of their tokamak - a pioneering plasma containment concept - claims. Pease formed a close and life-long rapport with their leader, Lev Artsimovich. </p> <p>In 1970, he opened a dialogue with Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community) on British participation in its programme, though Britain was not yet a member of the European Community. When Britain did join, in 1973, Culham became involved in the Joint European Torus working group (Jet), and Pease pushed for the tokamak experiment to have a more ambitious design objective, to achieve a full-scale demonstration of thermonuclear fusion. He was subsequently involved in a long political wrangle over the location of Jet, and deserves much of the credit for the eventual decision of the EU council of ministers in 1977 that it should be at Culham. </p> <p>While Jet remains the world's leading fusion research apparatus, Pease was already pushing for its successor, Iter (international thermonuclear experimental reactor), itself now quagmired in geopolitical debate. He retired in 1988. </p> <p>His many honours included election to the Royal Society in 1977 (he became a council member and vice-president), and the award of the Glazebrook medal, the premier award in Britain for physics, in 1989. However, with his exceptional combination of long-range vision and tactical skill, his outstanding contribution to the British fusion programme was as a manager of what had become \"big science\". In the nuclear debate, Bas was a crossbencher - a strong advocate for the use of nuclear power, but equally opposed to nuclear weapons. He was a prominent member of the British Pugwash Group and a member of its international council when the Nobel peace prize was awarded jointly to it and its then president, Joseph Rotblat, in 1995. He contributed to a number of Pugwash publications, including one giving the case against the replacement of Trident. </p> <p>Bas was very much a family man. His first wife, Susan, had five children, and he used to take the whole family, including grandchildren, on holiday - though was sometimes heard to mutter that \"a round of ice cream would set you back\". Accomplished on both the clarinet and piano, he played in the Newbury amateur symphony orchestra. He also loved walking and entertaining his friends in his Berkshire home. </p> <p>After Susan's death in 1996, he married Jean, whom he had known at Culham. She died in 2000, and he married Eleanor, who survives him along with his three sons and two daughters. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Rendel Sebastian Pease, physicist, born November 2 1922; died October 17 2004</p>",

  "<p>Lakshmi Mittal, who is based in the UK, yesterday set his seal on the consolidation of the global steel industry with a $17.8bn (\u00a310bn) double merger to create the world's largest producer. </p> <p>Ispat Steel, where Mr Mittal has a 77% holding, is reversing into his family's privately held LNM Group and at the same time buying America's International Steel Group. </p> <p>Ispat is paying $13.3bn in shares for LNM as part of a package that will see the selling shareholders, which include the Mittal family, pick up a one-off dividend of $2bn. Meanwhile, Ispat is offering cash and paper for ISG, which values the US group at around $4.5bn. </p> <p>The deal will leave the Mittal family with an 88% holding in the new entity that will be called Mittal Steel. </p> <p>The group, which will have a market capitalisation of about $21bn, will have an annual production capacity of some 70m tonnes - outstripping the world's current leader, Acelor. </p> <p>Last year LNM, Ispat and ISG produced 48.8m tonnes of steel, according to the International Iron and Steel Institute. </p> <p>\"We are changing the entire world steel map,\" said ISG chairman Wilbur Ross. The formation of Mittal Steel would create the same sort of change in the global steel industry that the creation of ISG, which includes assets of companies such as Bethlehem Steel and Weirton Steel, had done in the US, Mr Ross said. </p> <p>Mr Mittal was equally upbeat. \"We are creating a new global powerhouse in the steel sector,\" he said. Mittal Steel will employ some 165,000 people in 14 countries in North America, Asia, Europe and Africa. </p> <p>As well as steel production it will own substantial iron ore and coal deposits, a significant advantage at a time when demand for steel is pushing raw material prices higher. On a pro forma basis it is expected to have revenues of $31.5bn and an operating income of between $6.8bn and $7bn. </p> <p>Indian-born Mr Mittal, who started his working life in the family's steel firm, created his steel empire on the back of a willingness to take on little regarded and poorly performing assets, often through privatisation programmes. </p> <p>\"He took a chance. He went into countries eight or nine years ago where other companies would not have gone until now,\" said Peter Fish, managing director of the UK consultancy MEPS International. </p> <p>Mr Mittal's first big acquisition was in Mexico, but he made his name in central and eastern Europe by taking over and turning around steel plants that were widely perceived as overmanned, badly managed and lacking in investment. </p> <p>Chris Beauman, a senior adviser at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has backed Mittal deals, said the company's success had been built on taking a different approach to other steelmakers. \"People might ask why, if it's so easy, no one else has done it. The reason is that steel companies don't do turnarounds. It is not their core business. Mittal made it his company's core business.\" </p> <p>The progress has not been without its problems. Mr Mittal ran into a row over a \u00a3125,000 Labour donation in 2001 just ahead of winning Tony Blair's backing for his bid for Romania's biggest steel maker. </p> <p>Analysts argue that the steel industry needs consolidation to cope with powerful suppliers and end users.

  "Sir Mark Thatcher's lawyers today attempted to overturn a subpoena ordering him to testify under oath to investigators from Equatorial Guinea over an alleged coup attempt that he has been charged with helping to finance. <p>Sir Mark, the son of former British prime minister Lady Thatcher, appeared in the high court in Cape Town for a hearing on the legality of South Africa's subpoena requiring him to answer Equatorial Guinea's questions. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea has 43 questions officials want to ask the 51-year-old businessman to help their prosecution of 19 alleged plotters of a coup to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema. </p> <p>Peter Hodes, for Sir Mark, said in court today that the South African government would be assisting Equatorial Guinea in an unfair trial by forcing Sir Mark to answer those questions. </p> <p>\"What we are dealing with in Equatorial Guinea is a military tribunal, or there is a good possibility that it is,\" Mr Hodes said. </p> <p>Sir Mark's defence team contend that it would be unconstitutional to subpoena him to respond to those questions while he has related South African charges pending. </p> <p>He was arrested in August and charged with violating South Africa's anti-mercenary laws by making payments to Simon Mann, the former British SAS officer who was jailed for seven years in Zimbabwe last month for trying to buy arms for the coup attempt.</p> <p>Sir Mark's trial on those charges will start in Cape Town on November 25. The offence carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years. </p> <p>The hearing that started today - which was a legal first in South Africa because it was televised - was expected to last two days. </p> <p>Among those on trial in Equatorial Guinea is Nick du Toit, a South African arms dealer alleged to have led an advance team as part of a coup attempt. </p> <p>Du Toit, who is the only suspect facing the death penalty, has testified that he met with Sir Mark and other Britons - to whom Equatorial Guinea would also like to speak - in the months before the alleged coup attempt. </p> <p>Mr Hodes, however, accused Equatorial Guinea's attorney general, Jose Olo Obono, of lying in an effort to convince South African authorities to question Sir Mark. Mr Hodes said Mr Obono claimed Mr du Toit and several others had given their confessions voluntarily and legitimately yet the men later said they were tortured and coerced into confessing. \"Obono has lied,\" Mr Hodes told the court. \"Du Toit and his cohorts had no legal representation.\"</p> <p>Outside court, Sir Mark said it would be \"inappropriate to comment\" at this stage.</p> <p>Among the questions Equatorial Guinea want to ask Sir Mark is whether his nickname is Scratcher, a name Mann scribbled on a note from his prison cell in Zimbabwe seeking help from friends, and details of his relationship with the former SAS officer. </p> <p>Sir Mark, who has lived in South Africa since 1995, admits that he and Mann were friends and neighbours in Constantia, a suburb of Cape Town. But he denies being involved in the alleged coup. </p> <p>The 67 men accused of being Mann's co-conspirators, arrested when their old Boeing 727 landed at Zimbabwe's Harare international airport on March 7, received sentences of 12 to 16 months for minor immigration and aviation violations. Mann's lawyers said they were on their way to do security work at diamond mines in Congo.</p>",
  "Israeli politicians held a stormy debate on Ariel Sharon's Gaza withdrawal plan today ahead of a critical vote that could give the Israeli prime minister the crucial support he needs to push it forward. <p>Mr Sharon is expected to win the vote due to take place at 8pm Israeli time, (7pm BST), but wants a strong victory to silence opponents' demand for a referendum. </p> <p>Nearly half of Likud's 40 politicians say they will vote against it, forcing Mr Sharon to rely on the support of opposition parties. Media reports say Mr Sharon should get at least 65 votes - and possibly as many as 70 - in the 120-member Knesset, with fewer than 48 voting against the plan.</p> <p>The vote in the Knesset is the climax of a confrontation lasting several months over the \"unilateral disengagement\" plan, which has riven Mr Sharon's Likud party and weakened his coalition government. </p> <p>Mr Sharon opposes a referendum, which would take months to prepare, as a stalling tactic and said it would only increase the divisions and the hatred on both sides. However, several cabinet members, including the finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, have called for a national poll. </p> <p>The disengagement plan, which would uproot some 8,800 settlers, has bitterly divided the nation. The latest poll of public opinion, published by Israel's largest daily Yedioth Ahronoth today, found 65% in favour of disengagement and 26% opposed. </p> <p>The withdrawal from Gaza would mark the first time Israel has pulled down Jewish settlements in the West Bank or Gaza. </p> <p>Mr Sharon opened the two-day debate yesterday with a passionate defence of his plan as the only way to secure Israel's future. \"This is a fateful moment for Israel. We are dealing with a difficult decision that has few parallels,\" he said in a speech repeatedly interrupted by heckling from hard-line opponents. </p> <p>Mr Sharon made some conciliatory remarks toward the Palestinians. \"Even today, we regret the loss of innocent lives in your midst. Our way is not one of intentional killing,\" he said. </p> <p>Israeli commentators said Mr Sharon's speech was remarkable, both for his gestures toward the Palestinians and his unprecedented criticism of settlers, whom he accused of suffering from a \"messianic\" complex. </p> <p>Many of Mr Sharon's former allies felt betrayed. Effie Eitam of the National Religious party said as Mr Sharon was the architect of the settlement enterprise, \"to talk like this to the people he sent, there's a name for it. It's a kind of treason\". </p> <p>Thousands of pro-Sharon supporters demonstrated outside the Knesset last night, singing songs, waving Israeli flags and holding signs reading \"leaving settlements - a choice for life\" and \"leave Gaza immediately.\" </p> <p>Today several thousand settlers and their supporters demonstrated against Mr Sharon outside the Knesset. The crowds included children from the settlements, which had cancelled school for the event. </p> <p>In other developments today, Israeli troops withdrew from the southern Gaza Strip refugee camp of Khan Younis, after a two-day raid that killed 16 Palestinians and wounded 98 others. </p> <p>UN officials and witnesses said the troops had caused great destruction, demolishing 23 homes and ripping up roads - damaging the water and sewage pipes. </p> <p>Troops entered the camp on Sunday night, to halt Palestinian mortar fire at nearby settlements. </p> <p>Early today, an Israeli aircraft shot a missile at a group of people, killing one Hamas militant and wounding seven other people, including two other militants, Palestinian hospital officials said. The army said the men were trying to place an explosive device near the troops. </p> <p>Violence in Gaza has increased in recent months, with Palestinian militants trying to prove they are forcing Israel out, and Israel trying to crush the militants to show it is not withdrawing under fire. </p> <p>Yesterday Israel agreed to let Yasser Arafat leave his Ramallah compound for the first time in two and a half years for medical treatment, prompting speculation about the Palestinian leader's health. </p> <p>Israel said it had agreed to allow Mr Arafat to briefly leave his compound, where he has been holed up since 2002, for medical treatment in Ramallah. </p> <p>The defence ministry said it made the decision after a request from a Palestinian official but Palestinian spokesman Saeb Erekat denied they had asked for any such permission and said Mr Arafat will not take up the offer. </p> <p>Mr Arafat has been suffering from the flu in recent days, but is recovering, Palestinian officials said. </p> <p>The Israeli media has speculated recently that Mr Arafat, 75, may be far more ill than has been revealed and could actually be suffering from stomach cancer. In recent weeks, teams of Tunisian and Egyptian doctors were flown in to examine him. Last year, he suffered from gall stones.</p>",
  "<p>In Weybridge, Surrey, a 10-year-old boy sees a tutor to prepare him for the 11-plus. He stands a decent chance of passing and getting a place in a much favoured boys' grammar school across the border in Kingston-upon-Thames. But he won't now be sitting the 11-plus. His parents can't risk it because, paradoxically, a new system introduced in England to make school admissions clearer and fairer is actually working.</p> <p>Of course, it doesn't feel fairer to parents of 10- and 11-year-olds who are tearing their hair with anxiety about school choice at the moment. But, at least in theory, the new system will ensure that, on March 1 next year, more children will be offered a secondary school place that they and their parents find acceptable.</p> <p>It's a long way from the fable of parental choice, but it has to be better than the near anarchy that has beset the admissions process in some areas, most notoriously London, in recent years.</p> <p>But will it make parents happy and satisfied, or will they be left feeling fed-up and cheated - forced to compromise in a system where there are too few brilliant state schools and not enough good ones for everyone? Reports of confusion from some secondary school information evenings in London and its surrounding areas, with conflicting advice being given on what they should do, suggests there will be a lot of the latter about.</p> <p>\"It's what I predicted,\" says Barry Sheerman, Labour chairman of the education select committee, which damned the distress caused by the school admissions system in a report published in July. \"By being fairer, the new system is going to cause greater disappointment to the articulate people who were very clever at playing the old system, because they had the advantage of higher levels of knowledge, information and networks. It makes it much more difficult, if nigh on impossible, to play the system any more.\"</p> <p>Under new coordinated admissions arrangements being introduced for entry to secondary school from September next year, parents are able to express a preference to their local education authority for a minimum of three schools in rank order; some areas allow up to six selections. A computer program, run by the LEA, compares the applications with the vacancies and offers of places made on the basis of the published admissions criteria of individual schools. The LEA picks the highest-ranked offer and passes it on to the parents.</p> <p>The idea is that as many children as possible will receive one offer from their list of preferences on March 1 next year. This should end at a stroke a system that allowed parents to make multiple cross-council-border applications; receive multiple offers from schools in different local authorities; and sit on them, waiting to see if their favourite came up, because there wasn't a single national date for offers to be released. This left some children waiting for months without a place - one child's horde of offers was another child's no offers.</p> <p>It sounds simple, but it isn't. For a start, city technology colleges are outside the scheme, so that's one complication. Independent schools are also outside it.</p> <p>Then, there are two versions of the scheme running: one, known as equal preference (which ministers prefer), where the schools applied to do not know where they come in the parents' ranking order; the other, known as first preference, where they do. Most authorities are believed to be operating equal preference systems, but schools in Kent, Essex and Luton - including church schools and single-sex schools - have challenged this and demanded to know where parents have ranked them. In law, it appears, there is nothing to prevent them finding out.</p> <p>Surrey is one of the authorities operating first preference, the only one to do so of 41 LEAs that have joined together in a unique admissions group to act as a clearing house for school vacancies across London and the surrounding authorities. (It is, however, in the early stages of a consultation with schools and parents about equal preference.)</p> <p>A coordinated admissions scheme was the brainchild of Tim Brighouse, the commissioner for London schools, but gained general support across the capital's LEAs. A grant from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister paid for it to be set up as an \"experiment\", but now that the complicated software is in place - and assuming the system is seen to be fair - it seems unlikely it will not continue.</p> <p>Across the border from Surrey is Kingston-upon-Thames, home to the prestigious grammar school Tiffin boys'. George James, who runs his own IT company in Weybridge, and his wife decided last year that they would like their son to sit the 11-plus for entry to Tiffin. To this end, they hired a tutor to help him prepare.</p> <p>Their son is still going to the tutor but will not now be sitting the Tiffin entry test. This is because their second choice, after Tiffin, would be the well regarded, and oversubscribed, comprehensive local to their home, where their daughter is already a pupil.</p> <p>Because they are local and their son has a sibling at the school, they are virtually guaranteed a place for him - but only if they rank it first in their list. If they don't, the Surrey first preference scheme means the school will know it was ranked second and their son's application will be pushed behind those of people who made it their first choice.</p> <p>That wouldn't matter if he passed the 11-plus, but it would if he didn't. \"Then we would probably end up with our third choice, which is not a good school,\" says James. \"It's absolutely maddening that he is going to be denied a chance of trying for the grammar school when less good people may get a place because their parents are willing to take the risk, because they can afford to go private if they have to.</p> <p>\"I'm philosophically opposed to that, so I don't have that choice. I don't know whether I agree with the principle of selective education, but it is the system at the moment, so he should have the opportunity if it's there. For the rest of his life, the decision we take now could have a big impact on him - I'm not gambling with that.\"</p> <p>The Jameses are not alone. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), which includes grammar school teachers, has received reports about a reduction in the number of children being put forward for school selection tests for exactly this reason. But Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL, feels this has to be accepted to achieve more equity in the system.</p> <p>\"Last year, some children in London were not getting a place in a secondary school until the beginning of the academic year,\" she says. \"That is not in the interests of social justice, children's justice or the effective planning of secondary education. You have to weigh the benefits of this scheme with the losses.\"</p> <p>Ian Birnbaum, chair of the London schools admissions system and director of education for Sutton, which has a number of selective schools, has been in talks with Surrey over its decision to stick with the first preference system. He would like the government to tighten the rules so first preference is used only in exceptional circumstances. \"It sits very uneasily with a coordinated system,\" he says.</p> <p>A ministerial reply to the education select committee's call for more teeth in the admissions system code of conduct is imminent. Changes to legislation could be made in the Queen's speech. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills points out that the current admissions framework leaves scope for LEAs and schools to design the coordination scheme they feel best meets the needs of the local area: \"The coordinated admissions scheme will not affect the ability of foundation and voluntary-aided schools to consult on and determine their own admission arrangements. However, where LEAs or schools feel that 'first preference first' is not working in the best interests of local parents and children, they can object against operation of such criteria to the schools adjudicator, providing supporting evidence. The adjudicator can decide to rule out first preference first as an admission criterion if he decides that there is sufficient justification to do so.\"</p> <p>But even where equal preference is the order of the day, parents feel forced into making strategic choices, even more than they did with the uncoordinated system, under which they could end up with more than one offer. As one parent in London put it: \"You read the information booklets and after about five reads and numerous cold towels you think you understand it, and then you go to the school information evenings and you are told something completely different: 'if you don't put us first you haven't a hope of getting in'. It's complete confusion. Even the teachers don't seem to know what's happening.</p> <p>\"There was chaos in the past, but you were dealing directly with the schools and you could have more than one offer and assess them. I can see why there was a need to simplify and reform the system, but it's not feeling very comfortable being in the experimental year.\"</p> <p>But problematic as it is, something did have to give in the old admissions system. London, for example, has an acute shortage of secondary school places in certain boroughs and a particular shortage of high-quality secondary schools.</p> <p>Under the old system, some children might sit nearly a dozen entry tests in different boroughs. In Birmingham, children could sit up to a similar number because of the same urban proliferation of selective schools of all kinds. Brighouse, who was director of education for Birmingham before becoming the London schools tsar, tells a story of parents who accepted two offers of school places in London, purchased two sets of uniform and sent the child part-time to each to see which they preferred. \"It was picked up when the odd pattern of absence showed up,\" he says. \"Meanwhile, other kids have to wait for a place.</p> <p>\"It would be wrong if someone's strategic first preference denied the genuine first preference of someone else, but this is better than the old system. There was a lot of patent unfairness in that. It will be fairer and it is a first step towards improving a chaotic system.</p> <p>\"It doesn't, of course, address the admissions criteria of the schools and they are still the ones making the offers. I would say to parents, for God's sake, look at the admissions criteria, because you might choose five schools and not get a single offer because your child doesn't meet the criteria of any of those schools.\"</p> <p>He believes the new system will push up the number of appeals over secondary school allocation. Hertfordshire, which has been running an equal preference coordinated admissions scheme for the past three years, has seen its appeals rise, but then so has everywhere else - nationally, school appeals almost quadrupled in the 10 years to 2001. With league tables laying bare GCSE success rates for all to see, increasing numbers of parents have bent over backwards to get their children into - or keep them out of - certain schools.</p> <p>Competition for some schools is maniacal. Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College, a city technology college in Lewisham, south London, is thought to the most oversubscribed school in the country, with 2,000 children chasing just 200 places.</p> <p>Parents with the money rent or buy homes in the catchment areas of favoured schools, or dig out religious allegiances to make their children qualify for a faith-based school. Or they drag in spurious health issues to back their applications. The parents who don't seek to bend the rules - or don't know how to - can be left out in the cold.</p> <p>David Chaytor, Labour MP for Bury North and a member of the education select committee, says: \"The system that has been developing in recent years has put more and more emphasis on what we laughingly call parental choice. But it's a grand deceit. In reality, parents have only the right to express a preference, which is severely constrained at the end of the day. In secondary education, in many, many cases, it is the schools that choose the pupils.\"</p> <p>He would like to build a national system based on feeder primary schools, which is already done in some parts of the country. Crucially, he would like the feeder schools to be socially diverse, so a mix of pupils would qualify for entry to secondary schools, and the house price effect - houses in catchment areas of well-regarded schools being higher than those in otherwise similar neighbourhoods - would disappear.</p> <p>Cyril Taylor, chairman of the Specialist Schools Trust, believes the admissions nightmare will be alleviated by the proliferation of specialist schools. \"Most schools will be specialist schools by 2007 and that will change things, because more schools will be good. Specialist schools with a similar intake to community schools do better. Justice will only begin to work with admissions when there are fewer underperforming schools.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, parents would do well to heed the advice of Philip Hunter, the chief schools adjudicator. He would like them to be more realistic about the schools they apply for. He would also like LEAs to consult parents about the type of admission arrangements they prefer - he urged Calderdale to do it in one of his most recent decisions.</p> <p>\"Whatever system you have got, there is a market among schools,\" he says. \"Some will be oversubscribed and someone will have to decide which kids get in and which don't. In time, more and more of these problems will be ironed out. Admissions arrangements will become more out in the open and clear and objective.\" In time.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> I have a Lloyds TSB Visa card and with my last statement was included a notice of change to terms and conditions. </p> <p>One of the items reads: \"If you don't make any payment on time we can make it for you.\" It goes on to say: \"You authorise us to make payments due to us under this agreement from current or savings accounts you have with us or Lloyds TSB Scotland plc if you don't pay them on time yourself.\" Then it mentions that if it does this it will also charge an administration fee.</p> <p>Can it do this?

As far as I can make out, you would have to sign an authorisation giving Lloyds TSB permission to access your current or savings account, much like a direct debit instruction, except that it is charging a fee for the service.</p> <p>But you could equally choose not to provide this authorisation to Lloyds TSB. Bear in mind, though, if you miss a payment to any credit card, the provider may charge you anyway, so the real solution is to ensure you don't miss any payments.

  "<p>Towards the end of Robert Frank's exhibition Storylines, which opens this week at Tate Modern, is a hand-coloured photograph of a couple standing in a field. They could be brother and sister, or young sweethearts - perhaps even nervous newlyweds. They pose stiffly, standing erect and a little apart, with their hands hidden behind their backs. Their clothes, like the photograph itself, are indefinably old-fashioned. The style of the photograph was probably already dated when it was taken. The photo's mount has yellowed, and the grey painted border looks as sad as an old lace ribbon. The colour, which has faded unevenly, no longer seems to quite belong to the image, if ever it did. It tints the picture like the cosmetics a mortician uses to tart up a corpse. </p> <p>The wall label says Untitled Found Photograph. Anonymous, Not Dated. This image is quite unlike any photograph the 80-year-old photographer and film-maker has ever taken. Except as a wistful snatch of unrecognisable history, it isn't even much of an image. Why has Frank included it in his show? It comes in the final section, Memory for the Children 2001-2003, so perhaps he was thinking of his own two children, both now dead. (Perhaps it really is a picture of them, but I doubt it.) And here is his father's coat, with a legend that tells us so, and some Polaroids over which Frank has written: Entre la Vie et la Mort (Between Life and Death). A lot of this is a bit confusing, even though we can feel the emotional jolts. </p> <p>Robert Frank: Storylines is not a retrospective in the usual sense, even though it is presented as a survey of his work from the late 1940s to the present. It is something much more poetic and elegiac, and as complicated as a life itself. Frank wants to tell a story, or even several versions of it. But the story isn't over, and he is still living it. He keeps on circling his own past, his own career, like a hunter after his quarry. Much of his work has been about trying to make sense of his own life, and the loss of his daughter in a plane crash, the death of his son after years of mental illness. There's sorrow and guilt, loss and anger in Frank's work - emotions so personal that his art won't submit to the usual exhibition rubrics. </p> <p>For this we should be thankful. Career surveys and retrospectives at major museums usually plod ponderously through a lifetime's work, and come replete with lengthy, respectful plaudits. Professional relationships are detailed, connections made, significance stamped on every image. Such exhibitions are best left for the dead - and although Frank is preoccupied with death, he is more concerned with the business of living. </p> <p>Death, however, always has and always will haunt the photograph. The living moments fixed by the photograph are gone in the blink of the shutter. But photographs also catch the smoke before it clears, the textures of a time and place. Photographs do something paintings can't do - or shouldn't try to do. </p> <p>I cannot look at the London that Frank photographed in the winter of 1952 without thinking that it's a faraway world, and yet also the world into which I was born. A place of smog, top-hatted city gents in Threadneedle Street, short-trousered kids on cold wet cobbles, a slick black hearse parked in the grainy, washed-out morning. Black-and-white photography, seemingly, was made for this, for the rancid light of the London Underground, the 1930s still clinging like fog to the early 1950s. </p> <p>For Frank, none of this was a cliche, any more than was the declining Welsh mining village he visited the following year, with coal-grimed miners walking home to a tin bath before the kitchen range, prim front rooms, net curtains, aspidistras. For the Zurich-born photographer, London and South Wales - no less than Peru, Alabama, Detroit or Arkansas - was alien territory. Frank was often regarded as an outsider: a bunch of American high-school kids accused him of being a commie, and in Little Rock, he was briefly arrested on suspicion of being a spy - which, in a way, he was. </p> <p>The images Frank took on his long road trips through America - the gas stations and lunch counters, guys on the street and at the Greyhound bus terminal, doormen, sleeping counter clerks and aging elevator attendants; or the people he glimpsed, walking, waiting, meeting and parting, through the window of a New York bus - now seem part of a mythical America that he helped make visible. People talk of the emptiness of Frank's work. I find it full of life, even if the lives his photos depict are often void of hope, unsatisfied, exhausted, and their surroundings as grim as they are tawdry. Frank redefined the photogenic. </p> <p>He is not my favourite photographer, however memorable many of his images are: the Kennedy poster dumped upside down on the seat at the 1956 Democratic party convention in Chicago, the arm-flailing orator on the stump, the Detroit car workers at the cafeteria counter and in the machine shop. Yet his work does strike me as brave and important. Memory, and how it lives in the present, becomes a central theme. </p> <p>Since he first took up a movie camera in the early 1960s, Frank has often aimed it at himself, his friends and his family. Visiting his son and daughter at the private school he sent them to in Vermont, to get them out of New York and away from drugs and other troubles, Frank filmed the tranquillity of life there (mucking out the stables, communal lunches, choir practice) and held candid conversations with his son about his failings as a father. The resulting film, Conversations in Vermont, 1969, is very far from his celebrations of a life spent hanging out with the likes of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, or filming the Rolling Stones on tour in 1972. (That film, Cocksucker Blues, was withdrawn as soon as the band could call up their lawyers. All we are left with here are some stills, though the work will be screened during a season of Frank's films beginning next month). </p> <p>Two recent films - The Present, 1996, and the newly completed True Story, 2004 - revolve around daily life in Frank's New York loft on Bleecker Street, and his ramshackle place in Mabou, Nova Scotia. Both homes are cluttered with memories. Frank berates himself for not having a subject except the lumber-room of his own brain, his frustration, his awareness that he is getting old. </p> <p>He films crows in the snow (beautiful in black and white, and even in colour), a visiting stag with velvety antlers. But he also shouts at them, railing at his inability to find anything better to film. Frank rummages through the litter of his own work, his son's crazy writings, his jumble of memories. He misses his children and takes a trip to visit his parents' grave in Zurich. </p> <p>You might think Robert Frank a crotchety old bohemian, an old beatnik with regrets. Those two later films, The Present and True Story, might as well be a single work. In fact, all Frank's work is of a piece, a singular life. We may want to extract particular images from his travels and assignments, or to analyse his work in terms of the history of photography, film and video - but life is not a retrospective. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robert Frank: Storylines is at Tate Modern, London SE1, from Thursday until January 23.

  "The incoming president of the European commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, today unveiled a number of human rights initiatives in a last-ditch attempt to persuade the European parliament to back his executive team. <p>Mr Barroso is facing a possible no-vote tomorrow from the 732-seat EU assembly largely because of his decision to appoint the conservative Rocco Buttiglione to the post of EU justice commissioner.</p> <p>Mr Buttiglione has made public his opposition to homosexuality, single mothers and immigration, and leftwing politicians argue that he is not suitable for the post, which would involve overseeing civil liberties and anti-discrimination rules in the EU.</p> <p>The incoming president argued before the parliament in Strasbourg that rejecting his 24-member team would cause a crisis for the European parliament. </p> <p>\"Changing the portfolios at this stage of the procedure could cause more political and institutional problems than it would solve,\" he said. \"My team may not be considered perfect by all of you, but let me ask you, is there any team in any of our national governments that we can consider perfect?\" </p> <p>Mr Barroso unveiled plans for a European fundamental rights agency and a raft of other anti-discrimination initiatives, including new laws to outlaw discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation. </p> <p>Socialists appeared to remain opposed to Mr Barroso, with Martin Schulz, leader of the 200 members of the Socialist group, telling him to \"think this through again\". </p> <p>\"I certainly haven't been given further confidence by your speech,\" he said.</p> <p>Members of the 88-strong Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (Alde), a third force in the parliament, have been split on the decision. Meanwhile British MEP Graham Watson and leader of the group, today gave no indication as to which way members would vote.</p> <p>Mr Watson said in a statement that his group would study Mr Barroso's new proposals to enlarge the scope of EU anti-discrimination laws and remove some responsibilities from Mr Buttiglione.</p> <p>While he welcomed Br Barroso's efforts, he also warned the incoming president: \"The approval process is not a rubber stamp. This parliament should not be treated as one.\"</p> <p>Mr Barroso, a former Portuguese prime minister, is expected to take on his role as new president next week, for a five-year term.</p> <p>The legislature will vote tomorrow and if there is a veto, it will be the first time the parliament has rejected an incoming commission.</p>",
  "With one week to go, Americans are being inundated by polls. At least 112 have been published for the presidential contest in the last week alone. <p>While it's tempting to look at the jumble of results and declare polling hopelessly useless, fact is, polls have a great deal to tell us about the state of the race. And not in the way people generally assume:</p> <p><b>It's not the head to head</b></p> <p>Polls are always reported as though there's a winner, and there's a loser. So a poll showing Bush leading 45-42 is headlined \"Bush leads by three\", when the reality is that Bush is actually losing.</p> <p>In US elections, any elected official garnering less than 50% of the vote in polls is considered vulnerable. As Democratic pollster Mark Blumenthal <a href=\"http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2004/10/the_incumbent_r.html\">notes</a>: </p> <p>\"Voters typically know incumbents well and have strong opinions about their performance. Challengers are less familiar and invariably fall short on straightforward comparisons of experience and (in the presidential arena) command of foreign policy. Some voters find themselves conflicted - dissatisfied with the incumbent yet also wary of the challenger - and may carry that uncertainty through the final days of the campaign and sometimes right into the voting booth. Among the perpetually conflicted, the attitudes about the incumbent are usually more predictive of these conflicted voters' final decision than their lingering doubts about the challenger. Thus, in the campaign's last hours, we tend to see 'undecided' voters 'break' for the challenger.\"</p> <p>Testing this theory, blogger Chris Bowers examined presidential poll results since 1976, and <a href=\"http://www.mydd.com/story/2004/9/3/22294/96534\">calculated</a> that undecided voters broke for the challenger 86% of the time.</p> <p>It's a dynamic that clearly weighs on the Bush campaign. Speaking to conservative bloggers at the Republican national convention, Bush's pollster Matthew Dowd said the 50% rule <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/blog_8_30_04_1525.html\">didn't apply to the president</a>:</p> <p>\"Based on the polling data they've aggregated on undecideds in battleground states, the Bush team has compiled the following profile on undecideds: they are overwhelmingly white, tend to be older, go to church often and describe themselves as moderate to conservative. Dowd says they can't find any self-described liberals who remain undecided.\"</p> <p>As a result, he predicted that Bush would either split or outright win the vote of the undecided bloc. While not outside of the realm of possibilities, there is nothing indicating that Bush could buck the historical trends embodied in the 50% rule. That they're forced to spin it away hints at their concerns.</p> <p><b>There is no national election</b></p> <p>While the press is obsessed with horse race national numbers, the fact is that we Americans don't elect our president directly. Rather, we have 51 state elections, including Washington DC. That means that for voters in 35 to 40 states, their votes really don't matter and neither do their responses to pollsters' questions. It is only voters in the small group of \"swing states\" that essentially elect the US president: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin (give or take a state).</p> <p><b>Different pollsters use different methodologies</b></p> <p>No two polls are built alike. Some weigh their results by demographics (race and geography), others weigh by expected turnout and party identification, and yet others don't weigh at all. Some polls attempt to filter out unlikely voters asking questions they think will flag those least motivated to vote. Some polls are partisan and will game their assumptions in order to give their side a boost in the results.</p> <p>This is critical when trying to sift through seemingly contradictory polling. Polling is nothing more than educated guessing. Some get it right, some get it wrong, and half the time luck is probably involved. That's why it's best to look at polls in the aggregate - easy to do given the sheer number of them - rather than obsess over any one particular poll.</p> <p><b>The state of the race</b></p> <p>With that brief polling primer, anyone can take a <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/latest/\">look at the numbers</a> and get a sense for the state of the race. And a strict by-the-numbers calculation shows that Bush is in serious trouble.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Ohio\">Ohio</a>, Bush numbers range from 43-49%, failing to break 50% in any of the 12 Ohio polls in October. Indeed, there are signs that Bush has essentially abandoned the state, working to build his electoral majority by winning three out of four in Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and New Mexico. But October polling in those states also show an incumbent in serious trouble.</p> <p>In 14 <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Florida\">Florida</a> polls, Bush hasn't broken 50% since a SurveyUSA poll conducted between October 1 and October 3. A subsequent SurveyUSA poll now gives Kerry a 50-49 lead in the state. In <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Iowa\">Iowa</a>, a single poll has him at 51% while six others range between 46% and 49%. <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Wisconsin\">Wisconsin</a> is giving Democrats heartburn, but Bush breaks 50% in only one of the nine polls this month. Two independent polls put him as far back as 43%. <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=New+Mexico\">New Mexico</a> has Bush in the 43-49% range, anaemic numbers in a state Gore won by less than 1,000 votes.</p> <p>Much can happen in one week, and Republicans are doing their part to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/markosmoulitsas/story/0,15139,1331610,00.html\">prevent a fair election</a>. Perhaps the Bush campaign is right and the 50% rule won't apply to them this year. But the Bushies haven't been right about much of anything the past four years, while Democrats are vigorously challenging voter suppression efforts around the country.

  "Tony Blair should have been in a buoyant mood as he left the Downing Street state dining room at lunchtime yesterday after his first monthly press conference since his health scare. <p>For the first time in months, the hour-long exchange was not dominated by the two issues which have been the bane of No 10: splits with his chancellor and Iraq.</p> <p>In what should have been a dream scenario for the prime minister, who has desperately tried to focus on domestic politics, the first two questions were about gambling and asylum. But the prime minister appeared hesistant and struggled to explain the government's thinking on these two potent issues which could cause him grief in the run-up to the election. Unsettled by a Daily Mail campaign against his plans to liberalise the gambling rules, Mr Blair tried to explain that 90% of the changes would actually introduce better regulation.</p> <p>As he came up for air after explaining the gambling reforms, Mr Blair found himself on the defensive again as he was questioned about the weekend claim that Britain has abandoned its veto on asylum. His answer would have done Yes, Minister's Sir Humphrey Appleby proud. Nothing had changed because Britain still retained the right to keep its own border controls, he said. Where Britain decides to opt into pan-European measures, it will lose its veto. But ministers will choose which measures to accept and so the veto effectively remains in place.</p> <p>\"We will retain the absolute right not to participate, never mind not vetoing it, not to participate. Where we have decided to participate, where we take a decision that we want to participate so it is a measure we actually want Europe to do, then we can get it done more easily.\"</p> <p>Such a convoluted response dismayed loyal supporters of Mr Blair, who admit the prime minister is struggling to focus on domestic policies and is finding himself wrong-footed on issues he once mastered with ease. \"We are all out of practice because we are used to questions about Iraq and personality splits in government,\" one supporter said. \"What today showed is that Tony sometimes does not focus on issues, such as gambling, until late in the day.\"</p> <p>Aides say that the key theme Mr Blair will bang on about in the run-up to the election will be security. This is designed to marry the two concerns voters have at the moment: a worry that the world is less secure after 9/11 and alarm at the rise of anti-social behaviour back home.</p> <p>Mr Blair gave a taste of the importance he attaches to security when he kicked off the conference with an announcement that juries will next month have the right to know of previous convictions. \"I accept this is controversial,\" he said. \"There are people who believe this undermines the defendant's rights, but for too long the scales of justice have been weighted in the defendant's favour and against the victim.\"</p> <p>His remarks show that, with the Tories adopting an ever more strident approach on law and order, Labour will not concede an inch on such sensitive territory.</p> <p>The Queen's speech next month will include a range of measures to reassure voters that the government is tackling anti-social behaviour. But supporters admit it is dangerous to link Iraq with domestic security because British voters have never accepted the link between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein. One explained his thinking: \"Tony has now accepted that he cannot get away from Iraq because everyone is talking about it. The logic is to bring security back home.\"</p> <p>His message appears to have hit home after a leading supporter of the prime minister called for a \"small steps\" approach. David Miliband, schools standards minister who wrote Labour's last manifesto, said: \"This government has in the main gone for a small steps strategy [which] are actually making a big difference [rather] than a series of bold steps that would or wouldn't have worked. I think we should be confident therefore to stick with the strategy, which is to keep making changes that actually speak to people's lives.\"</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>WINNER AND LOSERS STOKE GAMBLING FEARS</b></p> <p>The Wrap doubts that William Hill is taking bets on the likelihood of the gambling bill clearing parliament. But the chances of this piece of legislation becoming law are looking worse every day.</p> <p>The Daily Mail, which is energetically pursuing its Kill The Casinos Bill campaign, enlists Michael Winner to the cause. \"Mumsy died broke. She was literally hooked on casinos,\" the director explains. Winner's mother, he writes, lost GBP35m in the casino at Cannes. \"It was supposed to have been my inheritance,\" he adds regretfully.</p> <p>According to the Times, Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, is already being urged by her cabinet colleagues to establish a cap on the number of new casinos or restrict them to five or six zones. But Tony Blair defended the bill at his monthly press conference yesterday. \"Denying he gambled himself, except politically, Mr Blair said 24-hour gambling was a fact of life in Britain, whether it was horses, dogs, football pools or on the internet,\" the Telegraph reports. He spoke of \"20 to 40\" new casinos and said they would be confined to areas in need of regeneration.</p> <p>The Guardian weighs in with a poll suggesting that just over half of voters (53%) oppose new casinos, with a third in favour. \"There is, however, some evidence that the jibe by the culture secretary that her critics had a 'whiff of snobbery' about them has some foundation, with the poll showing that her gambling bill is a popular measure among skilled working class voters.\" Seventy-three percent of Britons \"have had a flutter\" in the past year, it emerges.</p> <p>\"'Snobbery' is the panic-button word of Labour ministers,\" writes Max Hastings in the paper. \"The casinos bill troubles many of us for the same reason as the national lottery ... I love opera and ballet and the great collections. But I feel a twinge of bourgeois discomfort that the money for upgrading our arts institutions has come from people least able to afford it ... The more 'accessible' gambling becomes, the more likely it is that ordinary families will suffer temptations and miseries that can prove crippling to their happiness, and are best kept as inaccessible as possible. The casinos bill stinks.\"</p> <p>Nonsense, says David Aaronovitch: the debate over the merits of a few more casinos is beginning to take on the characteristics of a \"moral panic\". \"It's unlikely that the Mail and the Guardian - when they agree with each other - will be right.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gambling/story/0,15248,1336129,00.html\">Public rejects Blair's casino plans</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1335841,00.html\">David Aaronovitch</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1335925,00.html\">Max Hastings</a> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1329261,00.html\">Times: Chaos over casinos</a> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/26/nbets26.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/10/26/ixhome.html\">Telegraph: Blair stands firm</a></p> <p><b>KERRY GAINING PACE</b></p> <p>\"The unmistakable sense yesterday was that Mr Kerry had the wind in his sails, pulling slightly ahead or closing in some of the most important states,\" reports the Telegraph.

  "Both major political parties were found wanting yesterday as they sought to present themselves as the toughest gatekeepers, who would hold back refugees fleeing from persecution. But future social historians will certainly give Labour higher points for a more rational approach. At the beginning of a two-day meeting of European justice and home affairs ministers, David Blunkett told a radio interviewer that the government was now ready to sign up to a new European Union plan to streamline decision-making. It would go along with ending the requirement for unanimous agreement on asylum and immigration in favour of qualified majority voting (QMV) \"as a logical outcome of the accession of the new countries, that with 25 nations, you simply can't retain a veto over everything\". <p>The home secretary pointed out that QMV could require countries to accept their obligations so that the UK was not at the end of a pass-the-parcel line. He explained: \"If other countries fail on the asylum issue then we are the end of the line, we are the ones who cop it. So on this issue we are right to ensure that majority voting can get other countries to do what we want.\" Britain would collaborate with border controls because people travel through Europe, not just as asylum seekers but drug dealers and organised criminals too. He was keen to collaborate with a sensible reinforcement of land and sea borders. Indeed, the UK had already helped the Italians, Spanish and Greeks in terms of putting frigates in the Mediterranean to help prevent \"clandestine movements\". He went on: \"We need the rest of Europe to get its act together.\" </p> <p>Then came the less principled benefit that Britain retained an \"opt-in\" right, negotiated at an earlier summit, allowing it to choose to ignore any measures with which it did not agree. Just to reassure voters who may have believed the Daily Mail splash headline \"Blunkett to give away 'our front door key' today\", Tony Blair emphasised at his monthly televised press conference there was no question of Britain giving up our veto on border controls. He explained: \"Unless we opt in we are not affected by it. And what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds.\" </p> <p>None of this was enough for the Conservative party. Although EU governments at both ends of the political spectrum have recognised the need for a common asylum policy - though remain divided on how humane the approach should be - the Conservatives remained adamant yesterday the veto should be retained come what may. Even when it had failed? Who said it had failed responded the Conservative home affairs spokesman, David Davis? The Liberal Democrats supplied the answer: \"The Tories have long argued that Britain is burdened by asylum applications. It is therefore odd for them to oppose measures that could encourage other countries to play their part.\" </p> <p>What was missing yesterday was any mention of the glaring shortfalls in our current system or the importance of pressing our European partners to aim for improved social assistance, higher common standards as well as closer cooperation on integration issues like family reunification. Closer cooperation does offer fairer \"burden sharing\", but it is also an opportunity to start rectifying the faults in our system identified by Amnesty International and the Refugee Council. These include restricted access to legal advice, poor initial decisions and an inadequate appeals system. The European Council on Refugees and Exiles, representing 76 groups, was right yesterday to remind ministers of how their promises made five years ago to balance curbs on illegal entry with guarantees of better protection had been broken. It is time to restore the balance.</p>",
  "David Blunkett yesterday claimed to have blocked a headlong rush to set up a common EU asylum policy which would include a Europe-wide border police force and a single agency processing asylum applications for all 25 member states. <p>The home secretary spoke as Britain abandons its historic veto on asylum and immigration - fulfilling an agreement made in the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty. He and Tony Blair insisted that the new policy \"actually gives us the best of both worlds'.' </p> <p>Proclaiming the value of the \"opt-in\" deal he negotiated in Amsterdam, the prime minister told his monthly press conference at No 10 that it allows Britain to embrace EU proposals it approves - such as curbing people-trafficking - while retaining a domestic veto on unacceptable measures. </p> <p>At yesterday's meeting of the 25 justice and home affairs ministers in Luxembourg, other EU countries, led by France and the European commission, signalled their determination to press ahead and secure common asylum procedures by 2010. Downing Street does not deny the other members now have that right and that London cannot stop them. Nor does it wish to. As an island state Britain has different perspectives, the premier explained. </p> <p>Mr Blair emphasised: \"There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls. (At) Amsterdam seven years ago, we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe. Unless we opt in we are not affected by it.\" </p> <p>Whether that quells the controversy being fanned by the Tory tabloids - with shadow cabinet support - remains to be seen. Last night the Liberal Democrats endorsed the adoption of qualified majority voting (QMV) instead of each nation retaining a veto. It is \"sensible and pragmatic\", said the party's home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten. </p> <p>One such example, biometric ID cards with fingerprints and irises included on passports, was cited yesterday by Mr Blair and will be discussed by Mr Blunkett and fellow-ministers in Luxembourg today. </p> <p>The asylum issue has become highly emotive in Britain, with lurid headlines asserting that the UK is giving up its independence by handing to Brussels the right to decide asylum and ultimately immigration policy as a whole. </p> <p>Tories have seized on the EU's approval of a new five-year plan, the \"Hague programme\", for a joint approach to cross-border problems such as terrorism, crime and human trafficking as a betrayal of the British national interest. </p> <p>David Davis, shadow home secretary, said the adoption of QMV voting - to be ratified by an EU summit next week and come into force in April - was the \"thin end of the wedge.\" It would lead to a common asylum policy with the UK \"opt-in\" eroded by pressure to comply with expanding EU law in the next few years. </p> <p>Labour believes those risks are slight and more than outweighed by the benefits of a reformed asylum policy. Eastern EU states, especially Germany, where the issue is even more potent than in Britain, appear to agree. They also share the Blunkett claim that a common processing centre was \"nowhere near coming\". </p> <p>\"This would require quotas and we would use the opt-out ... There is no threat to the opt-out and, if we don't like something, we can remove ourselves from it ... there's no slippery slope of scare scenario and I shall use the British (EU) presidency in the second half of next year to make sure of that,\" Mr Blunkett said yesterday. </p> <p>Despite calls from France and others for greater burden-sharing, he added: \"All we want is practical action rather than visionary dreams.\" </p> <p>That could mean sharing expertise over border controls rather than setting up a joint agency. Mr Blair cited Anglo-French cooperation to close the refugee centre at Sangatte outside Calais, a change that has helped cut asylum applications by 70%. </p> <p>But Dominique de Villepin, French interior minister, called for a swift timetable to respond to popular pressure for action to stem a \"flood\" of illegitimate asylum-seekers. Britain should \"act in a European manner,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>In a hectic office overflowing with toys, harvest festival offerings and scrapbooks of school life, Sue Seifert is trying on a hat. The headteacher of Montem primary in Islington, north London - winner of the lifetime achievement award in this year's national Teaching Awards - recalls how she donned the elegant little number, complete with veil and black feather, for the first assembly of term, \"to remind the kids I was queen\". </p> <p>Seifert, who left awards judges almost speechless with admiration at her inspirational leadership, commitment and determination to see children in Montem's deprived inner-city catchment succeed, has the kind of confidence in her capabilities, borne of over 30 years' experience, which allows such pleasing eccentricities free rein. In a world where many heads pace their corridors clutching a management manual in one hand and a set of league tables in the other, Seifert can be seen joining enthusiastically in the school's Friday morning family aerobics session, or in her socks playing \"hunt the shoe\" with the children who come to a \"playclub\" in her office during lunchtimes. </p> <p>\"I think playgrounds are the most uncivilised places in the world,\" she says, though she has helped to transform the Victorian school's own grounds with a garden and a colourful anti-bullying slogan designed by a graffiti artist. </p> <p>Underpinning her many innovations - unconventional and otherwise - at Montem is a powerful sense of purpose, directed squarely at improving education, in the fullest sense, for all pupils. The school, lying on the busy Hornsey Road, is a far cry from the fabled Islington of minimalist restaurants and soaring house prices, serving instead one of the borough's poorest areas, with a high number of first-generation immigrants, as well as asylum seekers and other families with no permanent home. </p> <p>When Seifert arrived as acting head in 1998, however, Montem was signally failing to meet such challenges. With no permanent headteacher, and a poor educational track record, it was sliding into chaos and haemorrhaging staff and pupils. </p> <p>\"I had been a trouble-shooting head,\" she recalls, \"but I said 'the last person who did a job like this walked on water and was crucified'. It was awful - the children were out of control, the staff were not playing in a team: it was a complete jumble sale, a mess. I just felt as if everyone was drowning.\" </p> <p>The new head swiftly set about bringing order from chaos, drawing on experience gained running Islington's successful Thornhill primary for 16 years, and then helping struggling schools in the borough as a trouble-shooting head. Her reorganisation extended from the large - ensuring the best staff stayed and were properly deployed - to the seemingly small, such as creating an orderly stockroom where the scissors were all in one box and exercise books were colour-coded by subject. \"Staff had been stockpiling equipment,\" she explains. \"They never knew when there might be a chance to order some again.\" </p> <p>Two years into her tenure, Ofsted gave the school a clean bill of health, and governors persuaded their acting head formally to take on the job. Montem has never looked back, turning into a caring and secure community respected by parents, loved by pupils and with rising educational standards. </p> <p>Testimonies to Seifert's talents recorded by Teaching Awards judges all pay tribute to her hands-on style - a characteristic demonstrated during the Guardian's visit, as she toured the building's five storeys inspecting flood damage caused during refurbishment work. When the leak happened, on the first day of the autumn term, the head grabbed a mop, determined to ensure children returning after the holidays were not affected. </p> <p>\"Sue is front-line,\" the school's award nomination concluded. \"She is the person who mops up the sick in the classroom, does the extra duty when someone is off sick, cleans out the fridges, washes out the sofa covers and takes the lost property down to the charity shop.\" </p> <p>Still more important, perhaps, are the head's individual relationships with parents and children. </p> <p>Judges also noted how her \"uncompromising, yet unlimited love\" was demonstrated as she greeted parents and youngsters arriving at school, telling one father sternly \"You are late, dad!\", while offering cuddles in passing to the youngest children and commanding another youngster who had failed to return home, to his parent's despair, to \"see me later\". </p> <p>\"She knows all the kids by name and has an individual rapport with every child,\" said one parent quoted in the school's nomination, while a former pupil recalled: \"I will always remember Mrs Seifert for her witty yet strange sense of humour that always had an underlying sense of seriousness about it, helping you believe in yourself.\" </p> <p>A belief in her pupils and a determination to encourage them to have faith in themselves lie at the heart of her philosophy. The undeniable obstacles facing many of Montem's youngsters - some of whom have come from war zones, or from the most vulnerable family backgrounds - simply spur her to push them further. </p> <p>\"The duty I have to these kids is to put them out into society where they can operate, and if standard English and manners is what they need, that is what they will bloody well get from me.\" A child coming to the head's office at playtime to ask for a ball is smartly asked to \"say please\", and told: \"I like your smile, but at the right time.\" </p> <p>Almost three-quarters of Montem's pupils have English as a second language, and more than half qualify for free school meals, but none must be written off - as some staff did under the school's former regime - stresses the head, who relates the children's experiences directly to her own background as the granddaughter of Jewish refugees \"chucked out of Poland\". </p> <p>\"When I first came here, one of the teachers said to me 'What do you expect from these kids?' That phrase was like a red rag to a bull to me, and I said 'I expect them all to have places at Oxford University by the time they are 11 - is that too much to ask?' What right has anyone to condemn any child?\" </p> <p>Ask Seifert what she hopes Montem pupils will gain from their time at the school, and she is utterly serious. \"I can teach them to read and write and do maths, but if they leave me never wanting to open another book then I have actually done something seriously wrong. </p> <p>\"It's about the whole child. I want them to leave me with a love of reading, but also able to make decisions, to be people who can think, people who can debate, people who can make choices, and who care about other people.\" She grins broadly, and shoves back an escaped strand of grey hair. \"Basically good trade unionists!\"</p> <p><strong>The results</strong></p> <p><strong>The judges say</strong> <br>\"She has truly given her professional lifetime to generations of children and, through them, to parents, governors and colleagues. Her children's success is far more important to her than any recognition we can offer.\"</p> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong> <br>Sue Seifert, Montem primary school (London); Keith Chance, Hamilton community college (East Midlands); Helen Penny, Brentwood Ursuline Convent high school (east); Richard Townsend, Dunraven school (London); John Graham, Hurworth primary school (north-east and Cumbria); Patricia Johnston, John Spence community high school (north east and Cumbria); Tony Storey, the Hayfield school (north); Christine Charnock, Turton &amp; Edgworth CE/Methodist primary school (north-west); Tony Charnock, Holy Cross RC high school, (north-west); Anne Tanney, Holy Cross girls primary school (Northern Ireland); Aedan Kerney, Boundstone community college (south east); Pat Hallett, Fox Hill primary school (south); Joy Pritchard, Kingsbridge community college (south west); Carol Field, Ysgol Gwaenynog infant school (Wales); Eric Evans, Dyffryn Taf (Wales); Ray Speakman, Nicholas Chamberlaine school (West Midlands); Irene Hunt, Headlands school (west)</p>",
  "<p>If he ever had a good reason for wanting to walk to the South Pole, Steve Bull has long forgotten what it was. Too much has happened in the 22 months since the head of outdoor education at West Nottinghamshire College breezed into the principal's office and said he wanted to leg 700 miles across the Antarctic with a couple of students.</p> <p>And there has been much to learn: for instance, the attitude of the British insurance industry to this sort of jaunt - there isn't an insurance company in the realm prepared to shoulder the risk.</p> <p>\"Each of us needs to be covered for $250,000 [\u00a3137,000] for medical evacuation,\" says Bull, 35. \"We had to get it from Denmark.\" That would be the cost of the Ilyushin IL76, the old Soviet-era cargo jet that is taking the party of four from Punta Arenas in Chile to their starting point on the polar ice, making an unscheduled flight to pick up anyone needing a hospital.</p> <p>The risk assessment Bull had to carry out in order to persuade the college's governing body to give its blessing to the venture makes fascinating reading. Ski accidents, equipment failure, crevasses, weather, altitude, cold injuries, sunburn, navigation error, dehydration, snow blindness, polar bear attack, food storage poisoning, and starvation are just a sample of things that can spoil one's day on the polar ice.</p> <p>Polar bears? This risk assessment had to be drawn up before the team did its preparatory training in Greenland last April, and there was an outside chance that a bear might take a shine to Bull; Gary Dodds, 50, who manages foundation studies at the college; Carl Alvey, 21, who has just completed a level 3 NVQ in outdoor education; or to 18-year-old Robert Dunn, who is on an entry-to-employment course.</p> <p>After further training this summer in Norway, and never-ending fitness training, including dragging 70kg tyres around nearby Sherwood Forest in simulation of the equipment and provisions each will haul across the ice, the group is ready to depart for Chile and thence to the Antarctic.</p> <p>The shape of the venture has radically changed since it was first reported in Education Guardian. Originally, Bull and a couple of students were to start walking - or rather, shuffling along on skis - 700 miles from the pole. At 89 degrees south, 60 nautical miles short of their destination, Dunn and Dodds were to join them.</p> <p>Now they will all start out together from Patriot Hills for those 60 miles that cover the last degree of latitude. This trek, through temperatures that could drop to minus 40C - minus 50C with the wind chill factor - could take up to 10 days, Bull reckons. \"We decided not to go the full 700 miles, having done a risk assessment.\"</p> <p>The smaller venture nevertheless remains formidable, recognised by the fact that this year's televised Royal Institute Christmas lectures will include coverage of it.</p> <p>If the group makes it to the American base at the South Pole, it will be the first from an educational institution to have managed the feat, says Dodds. And Dunn will be the youngest person to have done it. \"I've always wanted to do something great,\" Dunn explains. \"A lot of people have written me off. Teachers in my previous school said I'd never get a job; I'd be a 'lowlife', basically.\"</p> <p>The fundraising that precedes such a venture is as big a task as the expedition itself. The Greenland training cost \u00a325,000, and the Antarctic episode \u00a376,000. The money has come from myriad sources and stunts. The college has put in \u00a315,000.</p> <p>To offset some of the expense, the group will be testing various products, including a brand of all-weather paint.</p> <p>Though Bull says he has forgotten his original impulse for the expedition, it will have many educational spin-offs for the college, and many schools will be tracking the quartet's daily progress.</p> <p>And it will buck the current reluctance among schools and colleges to take young people on adventurous field trips, he says. \"We are showing that you can go to the ends of the earth, if you follow the appropriate procedure and do the risk assessment.\"</p>"
