  "More atrocities like the Beslan school seizure are \"inevitable\" unless President Vladimir Putin changes his policy towards Chechnya, the European representative of the republic's last freely-elected president, Aslan Maskhadov, warned yesterday. <p>Akhmed Zakayev, who has political asylum in Britain, accused western governments of sharing responsibility for terrorism because of their silence about Russia's human rights violations in Chechnya. </p> <p>\"Your silence has given Putin carte blanche in his attempts to solve the Chechen conflict by force,\" he said. \"Double standards by the west, which does not seem to hesitate to issue condemnations or intervene in other parts of the world suffering similar or less extreme forms of state-sponsored violence, are pushing many peaceful Chechens into carrying out extremist acts.\" </p> <p>The Russian military had killed more than 200,000 people in Chechnya, including 35,000 children, he claimed at a London press conference. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev said international terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism played only a minor role in Chechnya, but the \"Chechen tragedy is being hijacked\" by extremists, partly as a result of the west's reluctance to press for a political solution. </p> <p>He called for international mediation and talks between the Russian government and Mr Maskhadov's representatives. Mr Maskhadov hoped to bring all Chechen political parties to the table, Mr Zakayev said. But he rejected suggestions that the warlord Shamil Basayev, who has claimed responsibility for several terrorist acts, should be included in the talks. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev said his side had condemned the Beslan school seizure from the first moment. In his view the hostage-takers \"were not linked to any political forces in the North Caucasus\", but were probably local radicals motivated by revenge for loved ones who had been killed by Russian troops. </p> <p>He said they might also be Ingush who had lost land or had relatives massacred in 1992, when North Ossetians drove them from their homes in one of the first post-Soviet wars. This would explain why several Ingush were reported among the gunmen. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev ridiculed official Russian claims that Chechens were among the hostage-takers, saying the ones named were people who had been in prison in Russia for years. </p> <p>Boris Berezovsky, an oligarch from the Boris Yeltsin era who is also in exile in Britain, backed the call for talks with Mr Maskhadov. \"The precondition for peace is that Putin declares his readiness to stop the war,\" he said. </p> <p>As deputy secretary of Russia's security council under the then president Yeltsin, Mr Berezovsky helped to bring about the peace talks which ended the first Chechen war in 1997. He acknowledged that Mr Maskhadov no longer had full control over Chechnya's fighters, but said: \"If Putin says he's willing to have talks, Maskhadov will regain it.\" </p> <p>Mr Putin's plan, announced on Monday, to tighten central power in Russia by abolishing elections for regional governors and appointing them instead, was disastrous. \"The complete opposite is needed. He should make Russia a confederation with flexibility and maximum opportunity for autonomy within it,\" he said. </p> <p>The Russian government yesterday announced that it would pour 157bn roubles (\u00a33bn) into the security and law enforcement services next year. \"We need new means for fighting terrorism, including legislative ones,\" the finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said, according to the Interfax news agency. He also announced that 1.4bn roubles would be spent on improving security on Moscow's metro and other public places next year. </p> <p>The decision came days after Mr Putin criticised the security forces for failing to prevent attacks in the unstable southern regions as well as Moscow. </p> <p>At least 32 militants are believed to have travelled easily through checkpoints set up on the regional borders between the Russian republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia before the hostage-taking at Beslan, which saw 330 people killed, as well as 31 hostage-takers. </p> <p>The FSB, successor to the KGB, was also embarrassed by its worst-ever losses in the siege - at least 11 members of its elite Vympel and Alpha squads were killed. </p> <p>Russia's prosecutor general, Vladimir Ustinov, yesterday said nine charges including terrorism had been laid against the sole militant held after the siege, a Chechen-born man, Nurpasha Kulayev.</p>",
  "Florida and Jeb Bush, the president's brother, were once more at the centre of a legal row over the presidential election yesterday, after Governor Bush's administration intervened to ensure Ralph Nader was on the state ballot. <p>Florida Democrats, fearing Mr Nader will take votes away from them, accused the state government of flouting a court order last Wednesday that removed the third party candidate and veteran consumer activist from the ballot, on the grounds that the group sponsoring him, the Reform party, was not a nationally recognised party. </p> <p>Mr Nader's lawyers challenged the verdict but his name remained off the state ballot pending the appeal. However, Governor Bush's secretary of state, Glenda Hood, has stepped in and submitted her own appeal which automatically suspended the court order, putting Mr Nader back in the running just in time for absentee ballots to be posted to 50,000 US soldiers and other overseas voters by a Saturday deadline. </p> <p>\"This is blatant political manoeuvring by Jeb Bush to give his brother a leg-up on election day,\" the Florida Democratic party's chairman, Scott Maddox, said. \"And it's just plain wrong.\" </p> <p>Once Mr Nader's name was on absentee ballots, the state government would use the fact to strengthen the case to include it on all ballots across Florida on election day, Mr Maddox claimed. </p> <p>Democrats also pointed out that Mr Nader's campaign had hired a Republican lawyer, Kenneth Sukhia, who worked for Mr Bush in the dramatic 2000 election recount, as proof that the Bush White House was conniving in Nader's efforts to get on to the ballot. </p> <p>Democratic outrage was fuelled when Ms Hood's office blamed Hurricane Ivan, which is bearing down on the Gulf of Mexico coast, for its unusual intervention on behalf of a third party candidate. </p> <p>A hearing on the case had been scheduled for tomorrow, but the state elections director Dawn Roberts claimed that Ivan might make that hearing impossible, and potentially deny Mr Nader's right to be on the ballot. </p> <p>\"There remains a substantial question as to when such a hearing on the permanent injunction will be held, considering the track of Hurricane Ivan,\" Ms Roberts argued in a memorandum to county election supervisors who had just ordered new ballots printed without Mr Nader's name. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans were being evacuated yesterday from a swath of the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle in the west of the state, in anticipation of the hurricane as it moved north-west out of the Caribbean. </p> <p>Ms Hood denied that the state government was taking sides, but simply intervening to ensure that nobody's democratic rights were infringed. </p> <p>\"We are acting as an honest broker,\" the Florida secretary of state said </p> <p>Governor Bush's administration was the focus of complaints in 2000, when thousands of black Floridians were removed from electoral lists because they were wrongly classified as former felons without voting rights. </p> <p>Ms Hood's predecessor, Katherine Harris, was also attacked by Democrats at the time for summarily rejecting their appeals against the first vote count, and certifying the initial results which gave the state, and the presidency, to George Bush. </p> <p>After five weeks of legal wrangling, the US supreme court weighed in and awarded the election, by a one-vote majority to Mr Bush. </p> <p>This year, the state is being carefully scrutinised for its conduct of the election, and was recently forced to abandon the use of another felons list that was found to be faulty. Democrats and civil rights activists have pointed towards the use this year of computer voting as a possible new source of errors and fraud. </p> <p>Mr Nader won 97,000 votes in Florida four years ago as the Green party candidate, when Mr Bush was declared to have clinched the election by a margin of only 537 over Al Gore. However, some polls this year have suggested he would draw no more votes away from John Kerry than from President Bush.</p>",
  "<p>Opec is under pressure to lift official production levels at a critical meeting today as global crude prices rose again on the back of pipeline attacks in Iraq and hurricanes heading for the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The cartel of leading oil producers is already pumping more than its official quota to meet escalating demand but prices have continued to rise, gaining a further 75\u00a2 to $44.62 a barrel in New York yesterday.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia said it would continue to supply a quota-busting 9.5m barrels a day in October to bring down prices.</p> <p>\"Forty dollars is not low enough. The fundamentals do not support this price and Opec does not support this price,\" said Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi ahead of the meeting in Vienna.</p> <p>Algeria would like to see an 8% rise in output targets while Kuwait believes a further increase would give the right signal to the market. But Libya said there was still a chance prices could suddenly \"crash\", and Saudi is not convinced of the need to change quotas.</p> <p>Opec is also expected to review whether the $22-$28 official price target range should be raised to $30 per barrel, although some cartel members fear this would alarm traders.</p> <p>The cost of crude has dropped from the record $49.40 level last month, but was back up again yesterday as an attack on a pipeline in northern Iraq brought a halt to exports from the Turkish port of Ceyhan.</p> <p>As many as 300,000 barrels a day of crude exports from the Kirkuk fields were hit a week after the main line to the Mediterranean was taken out of action by saboteurs. A pipeline in the south of Iraq was also hit on Monday, but this did not stop exports.</p> <p>The Middle East problems were compounded by production being halted in the Mexican Gulf as more than 3,000 oil workers were evacuated from platforms as hurricane Ivan headed for the area.</p> <p>Shell shut down 272,000 barrels per day of production while ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco and Total followed suit as the storm prepared to arrive on land from the Caribbean.</p> <p>\"US crude inventories have been drawing down as we head into winter; any headline on supply interruptions will push the market up,\" said Tony Nunan, a general manager at Mitsubishi in Tokyo.</p> <p>There was encouraging demand for new exploration acreage in the UK North Sea. Energy minister Mike O'Brien offered 97 offshore licences to 58 companies. Among those that have been awarded new scope for work in the North Sea are BG, Shell and Total.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of residents of the Scottish borders are to lose their normal TV service after media watchdog Ofcom earmarked the region as the first in Britain to have its analogue signal switched off completely.</p> <p>According to broadcasting sources, the draft versions of the new digital licences that will cover the period when the government will begin switching off the analogue terrestrial television signal indicate that the sparsely populated region will be the guinea pig for the rest of the country. </p> <p>It means that the regular over-the-air analogue services will be phased out and only those who are connected to digital services on satellite, cable or the terestrial digital service, Freeview will be able to watch TV.</p> <p>The government has vowed not to switch off the analogue network until the majority of homes have upgraded to digital, but it will be anxiously using the Borders region to find out what level of uptake is politically acceptable.</p> <p>Some think it will not switch off until more than 95% of the region has upgraded but that it will use a \"cattle-prod\" approach by switching off one channel - say BBC2 or Channel 4 - first to persuade the final rump of analogue viewers to switch before it closes down analogue completely.</p> <p>The area - which covers the western area of the British Isles from the north of the Lake District in England to southern Scotland and also includes the Isle of Man - has a population of just 450,000 and includes just one major city, Carlisle.</p> <p>Several areas had previously been mooted as potential test beds for the switchover, including the Channel Islands and south London. </p> <p>The border region has almost certainly been chosen as the first to be pencilled in for switchover because of its small population and the fact that it is covered by distinct transmitters that don't \"bleed\" into other regions. </p> <p>The Channel islands and the Isle of Man have also been considered for similar reasons.</p> <p>But it will present broadcasters and the regulator with substantial challenges in that it is relatively poor and its predominantly rural nature means digital reception of the Freeview signal is patchy at best. </p> <p>Broadcasters, and the government, hope the imminent launch of a \"freesat\" service from BSkyB, which will offer 150 channels for a one-off payment of around \u00a3150, will persuade those who cannot receive Freeview to upgrade to digital. </p> <p>The BBC is also talking to manufacturers and other broadcasters about launching its own \"freesat\" service. And the fact that the terrestrial signal is itself fairly weak in some rural areas will persuade households to convert to digital. </p> <p>But with the government ruling out the idea of subsidising boxes for larger swathes of the population, it remains to be seen how the residents of the border region will respond to being told they need to go out and buy new equipment to continue watching television. </p> <p>There are also likely to be significant difficulties in ensuring that all households have converted second and third sets and retuned their video recorders prior to switchover.</p> <p>Over half of all households have already converted to digital TV, through Sky, cable or Freeview.</p> <p>But adoption rates are beginning to tail off and it is widely acknowledged that a hardcore of digital \"refuseniks\" are unlikely to make the switch voluntarily.</p> <p>A pilot project in Wales will see the residents of two Carmarthenshire villages, Ferryside and Llansteffan, become the first in Britain to have analogue terrestrial transmissions switched off and replaced by digital signals in Spring next year. </p> <p>The trial numbers only several hundred houses and all those not converted to digital sets will receive a Freeview set-top box free of charge.</p> <p>Ofcom yesterday began preparing the ground for switchover by announcing that the new licences that will be handed to ITV, Channel Five and Teletext at the end of the year would include the requirement that they switch over to digital by the end of 2012. </p> <p>The 2012 date has already been mooted by the BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, and endorsed by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, who had previously insisted that the government would meet its previously announced timeframe of 2006 to 2012. </p> <p>But Ofcom said that broadcasters should be technically ready to begin switchover on a region by region basis by 2007. </p> <p>Earlier this year, an Ofcom report into digital switchover headed by senior partner Ed Richards recommended that process should begin in 2007. </p> <p>It recommended the formation of SwitchCo, a cross-industry group that would be charged with undertaking a nationwide marketing campaign to educate viewers. </p> <p>It also suggested that once digital take-up reached 85% in any given region, one analogue channel such as BBC2 should be switched off altogether to boost the digital signals and ensure they could be received by everyone. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>A huge ice-skating rink will be opened at Cornwall's Eden Project and a party held at London's Tate Modern to celebrate the national lottery's 10th birthday, it was announced today, as yet another lottery-funded project closes.</p> <p>Scores of famous lottery-funded projects will also be opening for free over the weekend of November 6-7.</p> <p>But the announcement was marred by the closure of the \u00a350m Earth Centre outside Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Britain's first landmark millennium attraction.</p> <p>Trustees said the project was no longer viable and that 51 of its 75 staff were being made redundant. Doors to visitors were closed without warning on Monday. The centre will be handed over to Doncaster council as part of a proposal to keep it open in some form.</p> <p>This is just the latest lottery-funded attraction to shut or run into serious financial problems. Others have included the Millennium Dome, the National Botanical Gardens of Wales, the Bradford faith centre, the National Centre for Popular Music in Sheffield, and the Centre for Visual Arts in Cardiff.</p> <p>But the festivities will gloss over these difficulties. Instead there will be an awards ceremony to recognise the nation's favourite lottery-funded projects and individuals.</p> <p>More than \u00a316bn has been raised for \"good causes\" since the national lottery was launched in 1994. </p> <p>The green-themed Earth Centre received \u00a336m of lottery money via the Millennium Commission. It had been plagued with problems since it opened in April 1999. Built on the site of two former pits, it aimed to educate people on how to live and work in a sustainable environment and was to play a key role in regenerating the area. </p> <p>It was expected to attract 500,000 visitors in its first year, but proved a flop with the public when only 80,000 came through the gates. </p> <p>The project, which boasts exhibits on recycling sewage, was reopened in 2001 on a smaller scale after a major refurbishment. </p> <p>Visitor numbers steadily increased and the centre did appear to be on course to hit its visitor number targets. The Millennium Commission's director, Mike O'Connor, said: \"We are delighted that Doncaster council has taken up the challenge of ensuring that the Earth Centre achieves its mission of providing much needed education on how we can protect our natural environment. </p> <p>\"I would like to thank all those who have worked so hard to turn what was a derelict site into a beautiful facility for education and leisure.\" </p> <p>The elected mayor of Doncaster, Martin Winter said: \"I am pleased to be able to further the objectives of Earth Centre and we will be exploring ways in which that can be done. I can give the assurance that we will not be taking over the centre with any financial risks to the taxpayers of Doncaster and will announce further details of our plans in the coming weeks.\"</p>",

  "The 10th anniversary of His Royal Highness' Business and the Environment Programme marks what is now recognised as the premier international forum for exploring sustainable development in the context of business. <p>Over the coming months we will take forward the wider sustainable development and environment agenda. Margaret Beckett is working on a comprehensive Defra 5-year programme to be released this year and a new sustainable development strategy for early next year. This will deal with, amongst other matters, issues of waste, recycling, sustainable agriculture, all aspects of biodiversity; and fishing, and will set out policies in each key area. For example, on the marine environment, I believe there are strong arguments for a new approach to managing our seas, including a new marine bill.</p> <p>But tonight I want to concentrate on what I believe to be the world's greatest environmental challenge: climate change.</p> <p>Our effect on the environment, and in particular on climate change, is large and growing </p> <p>To summarise my argument at the outset:</p> <p>From the start of the industrial revolution more than 200 years ago, developed nations have achieved ever greater prosperity and higher living standards. But through this period our activities have come to affect our atmosphere, oceans, geology, chemistry and biodiversity. </p> <p>What is now plain is that the emission of greenhouse gases, associated with industrialisation and strong economic growth from a world population that has increased sixfold in 200 years, is causing global warming at a rate that began as significant, has become alarming and is simply unsustainable in the long-term. And by long-term I do not mean centuries ahead. I mean within the lifetime of my children certainly; and possibly within my own. And by unsustainable, I do not mean a phenomenon causing problems of adjustment. I mean a challenge so far-reaching in its impact and irreversible in its destructive power, that it alters radically human existence.</p> <p>The problem and let me state it frankly at the outset - is that the challenge is complicated politically by two factors. First, its likely effect will not be felt to its full extent until after the time for the political decisions that need to be taken, has passed. In other words, there is a mismatch in timing between the environmental and electoral impact. Secondly, no one nation alone can resolve it. It has no definable boundaries. Short of international action commonly agreed and commonly followed through, it is hard even for a large country to make a difference on its own.</p> <p>But there is no doubt that the time to act is now. It is now that timely action can avert disaster. It is now that with foresight and will such action can be taken without disturbing the essence of our way of life, by adjusting behaviour not altering it entirely. </p> <p>There is one further preliminary point. Just as science and technology has given us the evidence to measure the danger of climate change, so it can help us find safety from it. The potential for innovation, for scientific discovery and hence, of course for business investment and growth, is enormous. With the right framework for action, the very act of solving it can unleash a new and benign commercial force to take the action forward, providing jobs, technology spin-offs and new business opportunities as well as protecting the world we live in.</p> <p>But the issue is urgent. If there is one message I would leave with you and with the British people today it is one of urgency.</p> <p>Let me turn now to the evidence itself.</p> <p>The scientific evidence of global warming and climate change: UK leadership in environmental science</p> <p>Apart from a diminishing handful of sceptics, there is a virtual worldwide scientific consensus on the scope of the problem. As long ago as 1988 concerned scientists set up an unprecedented Intergovernmental Panel to ensure that advice to the world's decision-makers was sound and reliable.</p> <p>Literally thousands of scientists are now engaged in this work. They have scrutinised the data and developed some of the world's most powerful computer models to describe and predict our climate.</p> <p>UK excellence in science is well documented: we are second only to the US in our share of the world's most cited publications. </p> <p>And amongst our particular strengths are the environmental sciences, lead by the world-renowned Hadley and Tyndall centres for climate change research. </p> <p>And from Arnold Schwarzenegger's California to Ningxia Province in China, the problem is being recognised.</p> <p>Let me summarise the evidence:</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The 10 warmest years on record have all been since 1990. Over the last century average global temperatures have risen by 0.6 degrees Celsius: the most drastic temperature rise for over 1,000 years in the northern hemisphere.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Extreme events are becoming more frequent. Glaciers are melting. Sea ice and snow cover is declining. Animals and plants are responding to an earlier spring. Sea levels are rising and are forecast to rise another 88cm by 2100 threatening 100m people globally who currently live below this level.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The number of people affected by floods worldwide has already risen from 7 million in the 1960s to 150 million today.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In Europe alone, the severe floods in 2002 and had an estimated cost of $16bn.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This summer we have seen violent weather extremes in parts of the UK. </p> <p> These environmental changes and severe weather events are already affecting the world insurance industry. Swiss Re, the world's second largest insurer, has estimated that the economic costs of global warming could double to $150bn each year in the next 10 years, hitting insurers with $30-40bn in claims. </p> <p>By the middle of this century, temperatures could have risen enough to trigger irreversible melting of the Greenland ice-cap - eventually increasing sea levels by around seven metres. </p> <p>There is good evidence that last year's European heat wave was influenced by global warming. It resulted in 26,000 premature deaths and cost $13.5bn. </p> <p>It is calculated that such a summer is a one in about 800 year event. On the latest modelling climate change means that as soon as the 2040s at least one year in two is likely to be even warmer than 2003. </p> <p>That is the evidence. There is one overriding positive: through the science we are aware of the problem and, with the necessary political and collective will, have the ability to address it effectively. </p> <p>The public, in my view, do understand this. The news of severe weather abroad is an almost weekly occurrence. A recent opinion survey by Greenpeace showed that 78% of people are concerned about climate change.</p> <p>But people are confused about what they can do. It is individuals as well as governments and corporations who can make a real difference. The environmental impacts from business are themselves driven by the choices we make each day. </p> <p>To make serious headway towards smarter lifestyles, we need to start with clear and consistent policy and messages, championed both by government and by those outside government. Telling people what they can do that would make a difference. </p> <p><b>UK Action</b><br></p> <p>I said earlier it needed global leadership to tackle the issue. But we cannot aspire to such leadership unless we are seen to be following our own advice.</p> <p>So, what is the UK government doing? We have led the world in setting a bold plan and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>We are on track to meet our Kyoto target. The latest estimates suggest that greenhouse gas emissions in 2003 were about 14% below 1990 levels. But we have to do more to achieve our commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2010.</p> <p>Our targets are ambitious and we must continually review and refine how we can meet them. In 2000, we published our Climate Change Programme, which set out a comprehensive range of policies aimed at reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Tomorrow, we'll be setting out the details of this review to see if it is achieving the necessary progress towards our short-term and long-term emissions targets, and if not, to see how we can do better.</p> <p>In the longer term, The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's seminal report on energy concluded that to make its contribution towards tackling climate change, the UK needed to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 60% by 2050. This implies a massive change in the way this country produces and uses energy. We are committed to this change.</p> <p>There are immense business opportunities in sustainable growth and moving to a low carbon economy</p> <p>The UK has already shown that it can have a strongly growing economy while addressing environmental issues. Between 1990 and 2002 the UK economy grew by 36%, while greenhouse gas emissions fell by around 15%. </p> <p>But business itself must seize the opportunities: it is those hi-tech, entrepreneurial businesses with the foresight and capability to tap into the UK's excellent science base that will succeed. Tackling climate change will take leadership, dynamism and commitment - qualities that I know are abundantly represented in this room. </p> <p>As part of next year's G8 process I want to advance work on promoting the development and uptake of cleaner energy technologies begun under the French presidency in 2003 and continued by the US this year. </p> <p>We need both to invest on a large scale in existing technologies and to stimulate innovation into new low carbon technologies for deployment in the longer term. There is huge scope for improving energy efficiency and promoting the uptake of existing low carbon technologies like PV, fuel cells and carbon sequestration. </p> <p>This technology is coming out of the laboratory and becoming reality in new fuel cell cars, combined heat and power generators and in new low carbon fuels. The next generation of photovoltaics are unlikely to need the now familiar panels: smart windows could generate the power required for new buildings. And carbon sequestration: literally capturing carbon and storing it in the ground, also has real potential. BP are already involved in an Algerian project which aims to store 17 million tonnes of CO2.</p> <p>What we need to do is build an international consensus on how we can speed up the introduction of these technologies</p> <p>And there are already many great examples of companies here in the UK showing the way:</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ceres Power based in Crawley and utilising technology developed at Imperial College have developed a new fuel cell that has unique properties and is a world leader, and</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> just a few weeks ago Ocean Power Delivery transmitted the first offshore wave energy from the seas off Orkney to the UK grid. </p> <p>And these are not isolated examples. </p> <p>Understandably, climate change focuses minds on big, industrial, energy users. But retailers are also working with suppliers to reduce the impacts of goods and services that they sell. I want to see the day when consumers can expect that environmental responsibility is as fundamental to the products they buy as health and safety is now.</p> <p>Government has to work with business to move forward, faster. For example, we will help business cut waste and improve resource efficiency and competitiveness through a programme of new measures funded through landfill tax receipts. We will follow up the report of the Sustainable Buildings Task Group to raise environmental standards in construction. </p> <p>The Carbon Trust is helping business to address their energy use and encourage low-carbon innovation. In total, efficiency measures are expected to save almost 8 million tonnes of carbon from business by 2010, more than 10% of their emissions in 2000.</p> <p>Our renewables obligation has provided a major stimulus for the development of renewable energy in the UK. It has been extended to achieve a 15.4% contribution from renewables to the UK's electricity needs by 2015, on a path to our aspiration of a 20% contribution by 2020. In the short term, wind energy - in future increasingly offshore - is expected to be the primary source of smart, renewable power.</p> <p>Our position on nuclear energy has not changed. And as we made clear in our energy white paper last year, the government does \"not rule out the possibility that at some point in the future new nuclear build might be necessary if we are to meet our carbon targets.\" </p> <p>In short, we need to develop the new green industrial revolution that develops the new technologies that can confront and overcome the challenge of climate change; and that above all can show us not that we can avoid changing our behaviour but we can change it in a way that is environmentally sustainable.</p> <p>Just as British know-how brought the railways and mass production to the world, so British scientists, innovators and business people can lead the world in ways to grow and develop sustainably.</p> <p>I am confident business will seize this opportunity. Cutting waste and saving energy could save billions of pounds each year. With about 90% of production materials never part of the final product and 80% of products discarded after single use, the opportunities are clear.</p> <p>Local, practical sustainability: new schools, new housing and re-invigorating 'Agenda 21'</p> <p>But government can give a lead in its own procurement policy.</p> <p><b>New sustainable schools</b><br></p> <p>There is a huge school building programme underway. All new schools and City Academies should be models for sustainable development: showing every child in the classroom and the playground how smart building and energy use can help tackle global warming. </p> <p>The government is now developing a school specific method of environmental assessment that will apply to all new school buildings. Sustainable development will not just be a subject in the classroom: it will be in its bricks and mortar and the way the school uses and even generates its own power. </p> <p>Our students won't just be told about sustainable development, they will see and work within it: a living, learning, place in which to explore what a sustainable lifestyle means.</p> <p><b>Housing</b><br></p> <p>The economic and social case for new housing is compelling. But we must also ensure that our approach is environmentally sustainable. This means action at both the national and local level. Heating, lighting and cooling buildings produces about half of total UK carbon emissions.</p> <p>In 2002 we raised the minimum standard for the energy performance of new buildings by 25%. And next year we'll raise it by another 25%. The challenge now is to work with the building industry to encourage sustainability to be part of all new housing through a new flexible Code for Sustainable Buildings. </p> <p>The new developments proposed in specific parts of the south east including the Thames Gateway represent a huge opportunity for us to show what can be achieved in terms of modern, smart, 21st century, sustainable living: not just in terms of reduced energy use, but also through better waste management, sustainable transport and availability of quality local parks and amenities. </p> <p><b>Re-invigorating Agenda 21</b><br></p> <p>Many local communities understand the links between the need to tackle national and global environmental challenges and everyday actions to improve our neighbourhoods and create better places to live. </p> <p>In 1997, I encouraged all local authorities to work with their communities and produce Local Agenda 21 plans by 2000. </p> <p>There was an overwhelming response: from County Durham to Wiltshire and from Redbridge to Cheshire, local people showed what could be done. Next year, as a key part of our new Sustainable Development Strategy, I want to reinvigorate community action on sustainable development.</p> <p><b>Action in the EU</b><br></p> <p>From this base, of domestic action we move out to action Europe-wide.</p> <p>We believe, as I know many of you do, that trading is the most cost effective way to reduce emissions. The emissions trading scheme which we have advocated and pushed in Europe is of great importance to our goals, and to those of Europe. The establishment of a carbon trading market throughout the world's most important economic area next year will be an enormous achievement, and will change the way thousands of businesses think about their energy use. Cutting carbon emissions is the way the future will be, and we have repeatedly said that there are advantages to British industry from early action</p> <p>In Britain and throughout the world, the expected rapid growth in demand for transport, including aviation, means that we must develop far cleaner and more efficient aircraft and cars. </p> <p>I am advised that by 2030, emissions from aircraft could represent a quarter of the UK's total contribution to global warning. A big step in the right direction would be to see aviation brought into the EU emissions trading scheme in the next phase of its development. During our EU Presidency we will argue strongly for this. </p> <p>And the UK is taking a strong lead globally</p> <p>From Europe, we need then to secure action world-wide. Here it is important to stress the scale of the implications for the developing world. It is far more than an environmental one, massive though that is. It needs little imagination to appreciate the security, stability and health problems that will arise in a world in which there is increasing pressure on water availability; where there is a major loss of arable land for many; and in which there are large-scale displacements of population due to flooding and other climate change effects. </p> <p>It is the poorest countries in the world that will suffer most from severe weather events, longer and hotter droughts and rising oceans. Yet it is they who have contributed least to the problem. That is why the world's richest nations in the G8 have a responsibility to lead the way: for the strong nations to better help the weak.</p> <p>Such issues can only be properly addressed through international agreements. Domestic action is important, but a problem that is global in cause and scope can only be fully addressed through international agreement. Recent history teaches us such agreements can achieve results.</p> <p>The 1987 Montreal Protocol - addressing the challenge posed by the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer - has shown how quickly a global environmental problem can be reversed once targets are agreed. </p> <p>However, our efforts to stabilise the climate will need, over time, to become far more ambitious than the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto is only the first step but provides a solid foundation for the next stage of climate diplomacy. If Russia were to ratify that would bring it into effect.</p> <p>We know there is disagreement with the US over this issue. In 1997 the US Senate voted 95-0 in favour of a resolution that stated it would refuse to ratify such a treaty. I doubt time has shifted the numbers very radically.</p> <p>But the US remains a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the US National Academy of Sciences agree that there is a link between human activity, carbon emissions and atmospheric warming. Recently the US Energy Secretary and Commercial Secretary jointly issued a report again accepting the potential damage to the planet through global warming.</p> <p>Climate change will be a top priority for our G8 Presidency next year</p> <p>Recently, I announced that together with Africa, climate change would be our top priority for next year's G8. I do not under-estimate the difficulties. This remains an issue of high and fraught politics for many countries. But it is imperative we try. </p> <p>I want today to highlight three key parts of my G8 strategy.</p> <p>First, I want to secure an agreement as to the basic science on climate change and the threat it poses. Such an agreement would be new and provide the foundation for further action.</p> <p>Second, agreement on a process to speed up the science, technology, and other measures necessary to meet the threat.</p> <p>Third, while the eight G8 countries account for around 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is vital that we also engage with other countries with growing energy needs - like China and India; both on how they can meet those needs sustainably and adapt to the adverse impacts we are already locked into.</p> <p>Given the different positions of the G8 nations on this issue, such agreement will be a major advance; but I believe it is achievable.</p> <p>The G8 presidency is a wonderful opportunity to give a big push to international opinion and understanding, among businesses as well as governments.</p> <p>We have to recognise that the commitments reflected in the Kyoto protocol and current EU policy are insufficient, uncomfortable as that may be, and start urgently building a consensus based on the latest and best possible science. </p> <p>Prior to the G8 meeting itself we propose first to host an international scientific meeting at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter in February. More than just another scientific conference, this gathering will address the big questions on which we need to pool the answers available from the science: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> \"What level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is self-evidently too much?\" and <b>\u00b7</b> \"What options do we have to avoid such levels?\" </p> <p>This can help inform discussion at the G8.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b><br></p> <p>The situation therefore can be summarised in this way:</p> <p><b>1</b><br> If what the science tells us about climate change is correct, then unabated it will result in catastrophic consequences for our world.</p> <p><b>2 </b><br>The science, almost certainly, is correct.</p> <p><b>3 </b><br>Recent experience teaches us that it is possible to combine reducing emissions with economic growth.</p> <p><b>4 </b><br>Further investment in science and technology and in the businesses associated with it has the potential to transform the possibilities of such a healthy combination of sustainability and development.</p> <p><b>5 </b><br>To acquire global leadership, on this issue Britain must demonstrate it first at home. </p> <p><b>6 </b><br>The G8 next year, and the EU presidency provide a great opportunity to push this debate to a new and better level that, after the discord over Kyoto, offers the prospect of agreement and action.</p> <p>None of this is easy to do. But its logic is hard to fault. Even if there are those who still doubt the science in its entirety, surely the balance of risk for action or inaction has changed. If there were even a 50% chance that the scientific evidence I receive is right, the bias in favour of action would be clear. But of course it is far more than 50%.</p> <p>And in this case, the science is backed up by intuition. It is not axiomatic that pollution causes damage. But it is likely. I am a strong supporter of proceeding through scientific analysis in such issues. But I also, as I think most people do, have a healthy instinct that if we upset the balance of nature, we are in all probability going to suffer a reaction. With world growth, and population as it is, this reaction must increase.</p> <p>We have been warned. On most issues we ask children to listen to their parents. On climate change, it is parents who should listen to their children.</p> <p>Now is the time to start.</p>",
  "A rejuvenated Royal Shakespeare Company yesterday announced plans for a celebration of the gunpowder plot, a feast of new writing, and a slightly-Shakespeare play next year followed by an ambitious season in 2006 of every word written by the Bard. <p>Artistic director Michael Boyd was visibly jubilant at the company's most successful Stratford season in 10 years, the slashing of the crippling deficit he inherited - and above all confounding the advisers who warned him Middle England would stay away from his current season of 17th century Spanish plays: \"I'm glad my optimism about human nature has been rewarded.\"</p> <p>The complete Shakespeare season in 2006 will be one of the company's most ambitious projects ever. It will involve dozens of visiting companies and many other venues in Stratford, and will be the first attempt anywhere to present Shakespeare's entire canon in one season, including all the plays, the sonnets and other poems - and the apocrypha, the many works claimed for him.</p> <p>Before that, next year's season will have an overtly political slant, with old and new plays dealing with explicitly political issues, including war, terrorism, race, censorship - and gunpowder.</p> <p>The company will \"celebrate\" - its choice of word - the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes and all that, with a Swan Theatre season called Gunpowder. It will not take the traditional bonfire night line on treason and plot.</p> <p>Mr Boyd said of himself, and his Roman Catholic deputy Greg Doran: \"As a Northern Irish man, and Greg as a slave of Rome, we do have a different perspective on Englishness, we just do.\"</p> <p>The Gunpowder season will include a new commission by the Irish playwright Frank McGuinness, and four Elizabethan plays which were dynamite in their day.</p> <p>Thomas More, by Shakespeare and up to four other authors, opens with a race riot in London provoked by asylum seekers to Britain fleeing religious persecution on the continent.</p> <p>The play was seen as a weapon of mass destruction and was banned in Shakespeare's lifetime: the manuscript in the British Library still has the censor's scrawl in the margin \"perform this scene at your peril\".</p> <p>It will be twinned with Sejanus, a political thriller set in ancient Rome which almost had Ben Jonson jailed for treason, and has probably not been performed in 400 years.</p> <p>The plays completing the season are equally seditious: A New Way to Please You, or The Old Law, by Middleton, Rowley and Massinger, is a black comedy on euthanasia - the old law requires the killing of useless old people; Believe What You Will, by Massinger, deals with a Middle Eastern leader hounded by a Roman Empire threatening sanctions against any state sheltering the terrorist.</p> <p>The main house will tackle the comedies, after this year's tragedies - which met a patchy critical response but have been a commercial success, with box office averaging 75%.</p> <p>Yesterday's announcements marked Mr Boyd's first full season as artistic director.</p> <p>He inherited a company seen as a basket case, with disastrous finances and worse morale. The deficit has now been reduced from \u00a32.8m to \u00a3500,000, which he cheerfully described as \"the sort of deficit that you play around with as opposed to treat respectfully\".</p> <p>Next week should also see a climax, if not a finale, to the company's own long running drama, which has had as much pity and terror, sensation and plot twists as anything on the stage. The board is due to consider the redevelopment plans for the company's Stratford-upon-Avon home, a listed building on the most prominent riverside site in the town. Although generations of actors have great affection for the building, it is a sweat box in summer where people regularly faint in the cheapest gallery seats.</p> <p>The subject has been contentious, since the previous artistic director pulled the company out of its London base at the Barbican while simultaneously expressing a preference for razing the Stratford theatre.</p> <p>The board is likely to decide on gradual redevelopment, with performances continuing at two out of the three Stratford venues at all times, rather than a scorched earth approach.</p>",
  "<p>As Opec begins its much heralded meeting in Vienna today, one thing is abundantly clear. No one has a clue about the likely course of oil prices for the next 12 months. But many observers are deeply worried. </p> <p>The price rose to great heights last month, almost touching $50 (\u00a327.70) a barrel, and has been hovering around $40 in recent days, with almost any potentially scary factor driving it higher, such as - until it veered away - the prospect of Hurricane Ivan hitting production in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Those of us who have been in the macroeconomic observatory for longer than we care to remember were brought up in a world where cheap energy was taken for granted. The use of the \"oil weapon\" by the (mainly) Middle Eastern producers changed all that during the two famous oil shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-1980. </p> <p>The price of oil became such an important factor in the macroeconomic equation that some economists, such as Professor Andrew Oswald of Warwick University, have made quite a name for themselves highlighting the close connection between macroeconomic developments - not least recession - and the price of that one vitally important commodity. </p> <p>The days have gone when Opec - the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - used the price of oil as a weapon. Its members have long since reached an agreement with the industrialised west (now joined in its voracious thirst for oil by China) that both oil producers and consumers have to live together in the world economy, and a certain measure of stability suits both. </p> <p>Thus, this week, Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, said: \"We are producing 2m b/d [barrels a day] over the ceiling. Saudi Arabia is producing 9.5m b/d and the reason we are doing it is to bring the price down.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, the fact that he praises Opec (of which Saudi Arabia is the key member - the \"swing producer\") for having lessened the \"upward pressure on price\" and moved it \"from close to $50 back to $40\", says something about his measure of success. </p> <p>Such prices are a significant level above the $22 to $28 a barrel target range which operated earlier in this young millennium, and well above the $20 a barrel which certain optimists thought would prevail in the event of a happy outcome to the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>Yes, there were such optimists, although it is difficult to believe. And most of them were at the top of the US administration. </p> <p>But we are where we are. The combination of a not very impressive world economic recovery and the rapid industrialisation of China, has maintained strong demand for oil, against the background of a world oil production system running at virtually full capacity, give or take the odd supply bottleneck (for different reasons) in Venezuela and Iraq.</p> <p>The sluggishness - indeed decline - in the real price of oil since the mid-1980s (when it was roughly the equivalent of a present day $80) has discouraged serious searches for new oil fields, as well as the development of known potential sources. And one must never forget that the fear of political instability in Saudi Arabia was a major motive behind the decision to invade Iraq. </p> <p>On any serious reading, the prospects for oil prices are finely balanced. It was interesting that Gordon Brown, who is not only Britain's chancellor but also chairman of the International Monetary Fund's key political committee, sounded a worried note in an article in the Financial Times last Friday, whereas Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank and the group of 10 leading central bankers, sounded desperate to be more positive earlier this week. </p> <p>From the UK's point of view, the good news for the chancellor is that a higher oil price means greater revenues for the Treasury. But this is a temporary benefit. Recent statistics indicate that Britain's days as a net oil exporter are coming to an end. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Keegan is the Observer's senior economics commentator</p>",
  "<p>I got home at seven and, unusually, he was home before me. His coat was thrown over a chair and his keys and change scattered on the hall table. My footsteps echoed as I walked down the hall on the newly exposed floorboards. I couldn't go anywhere in our new house without thinking: lighting, curtains, carpets, paint that wall, sand that floor, must get rid of that old junk. I turned the corner into the living room (hideous flowery wallpaper that was definitely coming off tomorrow) and there was Andrew, sitting on the matching flowery sofa, flicking through a newspaper. (Must get rid of that sofa.) He got to his feet when he saw me. \"Emily,\" he smiled. </p> <p>My husband, Andrew Drummond, was tall and broad with thick dark hair which he aimed to keep short but kept forgetting to get cut, and the kind of face that is described as having character. In other words, he had a broken nose and a scar on his chin (only rugby, a long time ago). I always thought he looked - to use an old-fashioned word - handsome. </p> <p>\"So how was the whisky today?\" He smiled broadly. \"Had a good day at the office, dear?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, it was really good again! We tried this very rare pink single malt.\" </p> <p>\"Pink whisky?\" he laughed. \"You've only been working at the Whisky Society a few weeks and already our national drink has become very girlie.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, it's pretty. You'd like it.\" </p> <p>He shook his head and pushed his fingers through his hair, the way he always did when something baffled him. </p> <p>\"It got re-racked into a port cask,\" I explained. \"That's why it's pink and there's port on the nose as well. I think we're going to bottle it, even though it is a bit too girlie for the established market.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think my dad could cope with a pink malt. I don't see it going down well at the golf club.\" </p> <p>\"Golfers are not the target market, to be honest.\" </p> <p>Andrew still looked very amused by the idea. \"So when are you going to launch that? Gay Pride Week?\" </p> <p>\"We want more girls to try whisky.\" I walked over to stand beside the fireplace. He had come home early and bothered to light the fire. What a desirable quality in a man. \"Traditionally, women just don't drink whisky. The industry would love to unlock that market and they've done quite well in other countries but failed spectacularly in the UK, especially with single malts, which at the moment is the only growing sector. Here, marketing teams just stand around like spotty adolescent boys at a party, wondering how to chat up the girls.\" </p> <p>\"So, is this your pet project now? You and Flora are going to show the whisky industry how to talk to girls?\" </p> <p>\"We can try a few ideas out at the Whisky Society. It's a small place and perfect for this sort of experiment. Nothing may come of it but it'll be fun to try. Anyway, I really do like the pink whisky. It's quite robust, despite its girlie appearance. Very strong. There is a bit of nose prickle.\" </p> <p>\"Is that a technical term?\" </p> <p>\"It is, actually. Then quite hot in the mouth and really good with ice.\" </p> <p>\"Ice? That's sacrilege.\" </p> <p>\"No, it's not, honestly.\" </p> <p>\"Did you bring any work home?\" he asked, hopefully. </p> <p>\"Not tonight. I've caught up on the ones I needed to taste for the list.\" </p> <p>\"You can try some of my St Magdalene if you like.\" He disappeared into the kitchen and came back with two glasses of the special bottling of rich lowland. Single cask, first fill. We sat down together on the sofa. I put my feet up and made myself comfortable. \"This is just overtime for you, isn't it?\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm really excited about the pink whisky. Wait till you taste it.\" </p> <p>\"Emily, you're turning into a complete workaholic.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not as bad as you. How was your day, anyway?\" </p> <p>\"Clearly not as much fun as yours.\" </p> <p>\"How come you're home early for a change?\" I asked him. </p> <p>\"I was supposed to have a meeting with my opposite number on a case but her firm postponed it. Great relief, I can tell you.\" </p> <p>\"Is your opposite number a real pain?\" </p> <p>\"She wants my head on a plate.\" He drank, then lay back and stretched out on the sofa. \"But she cancelled,\" he said cheerfully, \"and it's Friday night so we can forget about it.\" </p> <p>I sipped from the glass he had given me and felt deeply contented. \"I like coming home when you're here.\" </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>Suddenly, Flora was back: \"Look who I've found!\"and with her was a man I hadn't seen before. \"This is Jack,\" she said, leading him in like a trophy. \"I found him in the basement bar saying he was waiting for us. Jack, meet Josie and Emily.\" </p> <p>He was quite tall and slender with fair hair and a tanned complexion. He looked a little dishevelled, a little tired, but he was smiling to himself when he sat down at the table. An easy, happy smile. </p> <p>Flora sprang into action. \"Emily, where did you put that bottle? Look at this, Jack. You won't have seen a whisky like this before.\" She held the glass up for a reaction. </p> <p>\"It's only a little bit pink,\" said Jack. </p> <p>\"Only a little bit!\" Flora was put out. \"It's pale salmon pink. This is a ros\u00e9 whisky. It's not coloured or anything, it's natural. This is extremely rare and interesting, Jack.\" </p> <p>He laughed. \"I have no brand loyalty whatsoever.\" </p> <p>\"Jack is what is known as a promiscuous consumer.\" </p> <p>\"Try some,\" I said, and offered him a glass. \"Try some, Josie?\" </p> <p>\"I'd advise you to add water,\" said Flora. Jack tasted it without. \"It's hot\" he said. \"It just tastes very hot.\" </p> <p>\"It's cask strength,\" said Flora. \"It's 58% alcohol by volume. Do what I tell you and add water.\" </p> <p>\"It's a light, fresh lowland,\" I told him. \"Very clean and it will take a good splash of water. If you add the right amount of water, it should feel cooling in the mouth and warming going down.\" </p> <p>\"It's nicer than I thought,\" said Josie, who had put plenty of water in hers. </p> <p>\"I wonder what Diageo would think of this,\" said Jack. </p> <p>\"Who?' asked Josie. </p> <p>\"Diageo, the multi-national drinks company - not to be confused with Dodgio who are even bigger. Dodgio are so big they can do whatever they like. Diageo aren't that big yet. They're still at the stage of making little concessions to the Scottish Whisky Association - things like using a different colour packaging for the new bastardised Cardhu to distinguish it from the old, legitimate single malt.' </p> <p>\"Perhaps 'Bastard Cardhu' would have worked as a name for a new blend?\" suggested Josie. </p> <p>\"Diageo would never have risked anything like that,\" I told her. </p> <p>\"There's Fat Bastard Chardonnay and that's very popular.\" And, asked Flora, \"Isn't there a red wine called Old Git?\" </p> <p>\"There is,\" I admitted, \"but the wine trade is light-years ahead of whisky in terms of marketing innovation.\" </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>\"Emily is doing some very innovative work in whisky at the moment,\" said Jane, keen to steer the conversation at Bill's birthday party somewhere else. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said, making more of an effort. \"Why should we marketing people only address ourselves to middle-aged, boring old fart golfers?' </p> <p>\"I thought they were just your type,\" said Kate. \"You've always been very nice to Andrew.\" </p> <p>I tried to think of a light, tension-relieving reply, but all I could manage was: \"Well, Andrew has always been very nice to me.\" </p> <p>\"Drink?\" asked Jane, bearing down on us with a bottle. </p> <p>\"Have you got any of that Rosebank left?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"You'll be lucky.\" She checked the supplies on the table and found some for me. \"You are lucky,\" she said, pouring out the last of the bottle. </p> <p>\"Emily's got a few radical ideas about whisky, haven't you, Emily?\" said Andrew. </p> <p>\"Really?\" said Kate. \"So it's all right to put ice in your whisky, is it?\" </p> <p>\"You can if you want,\" I said confidently. \"You can do whatever you like. You don't have to be all fuddy-duddy and old-fashioned about it.\" </p> <p>\"No ice for me, thanks,\" said Andrew. </p> <p>\"Oh, go on,\" said Kate. \"You'll have to try harder to keep up, Andrew, or Emily will dump you for a younger model.\" </p> <p>The party wore on. I watched Kate talk and laugh with her old friends, moving easily in the crowd. Andrew was sometimes with her again, as part of a little group. I tried to join in but there were too many old stories and in-jokes for me to really follow the conversation. Andrew often seemed to be at the centre of these stories. </p> <p>\"Emily!\" called someone from the door. \"You should see the bonfire, it's great.\" </p> <p>\"Right!\" I said, relieved to have an excuse to get out of the room. </p> <p>\"Here's some sparklers,\" Jane said, pressing them into my hand. \"And some matches. Go and light them on the beach. Remember to keep the matches away from your whisky.\" </p> <p>I turned to Andrew. \"Are you coming too?\" </p> <p>\"I'll be right out. Won't be a minute.\" </p> <p>Halfway down the garden, I turned to see him and Kate outlined in the kitchen window alone together now. </p> <p>I couldn't face it, standing there in the garden, watching my husband absorbed in conversation with this tall blonde woman he used to love. I turned away and walked across to the beach. There were the others, faces glowing around the blaze of driftwood. They were all laughing, talking about the things they used to get up to when they were my age, happily dropping clangers. Looking out towards the cold North Sea and the dark horizon, I held my sparkler out against the blackness and watched it burn. </p> <p>Eventually Andrew joined his old friends outdoors and I waved a sparkler at him. He didn't realise who it was at first, but then he started walking rapidly down the beach towards me. \"What are you doing standing here all by yourself?\" he asked. \"Here, give me one of those,\" and he started writing my name in sparkling letters, over and over again. EmilyEmily Emily, he wrote. lloveEmily. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Extracted from A Nice Girl Like Me by Abigail Bosanko, published by Time Warner Paperbacks. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Abigail Bosanko was a whisky-tasting tutor at the Scotch Malt Whisky Society before leaving to become a full-time writer.</p>",
  "<b>Hurricane Ivan emergency aid</b> <br> Britain will contribute to an international appeal to deal with devastation wreaked by Hurricane Ivan, the international development secretary, Hilary Benn, said. He expressed \"sadness at the loss of life, injury and damage to homes\" across the Caribbean and told MPs that, as well as flying emergency supplies to the region, the UK had also sent two humanitarian advisers to assess what further help was needed. <p><b>Out-of-hours GPs</b><br> Patients should have access to home visits from their GP if they need it and to Saturday morning surgeries under new guidance to be published by the government, the health secretary, John Reid, said. The clarification of doctors' and primary care trusts' responsibilities follows concerns about a new contract allowing GPs to opt-out of providing out-of-hours care. </p> <p><b>Student finance</b><br> Liberal Democrat proposals to invest in students rather than saddle them with huge debts will be a vote winner at the next election, the party predicted. Their education spokesman, Phil Willis, said both the government and Tories exhibited a \"poverty of vision\" over higher education. But his party intended to expand opportunities for all students - regardless of background. </p> <p>In his first Commons appearance as higher education minister, Kim Howells insisted the government had devised a coherent strategy for reform. \"The goal is to provide access to world-class higher education for all of those with the potential to benefit,\" he said. </p> <p><b>Women's pensions</b><br>Women who act as carers, work part time or stay at home to raise children should have an automatic right to a state pension, Steve Webb, for the Liberal Democrats, urged. He said the party's plans for a \"citizen's pension\" based on residency rather than national insurance contributions would end an historic injustice. He added that if pensioners considered themselves second-class citizens in Britain then women were \"third class citizens\" among pensioners. </p> <p>The pensions minister, Malcolm Wicks, said the minimum wage had benefited one million women and reduced the gender pay gap by 2% since 1997. He added: \"If you are concerned about women's pensions, don't start with pensions, start with jobs and incomes. If women earn well during their working lives they are more likely to have decent pensions in retirement.\" </p> <p><b>Army reforms</b><br> The government has no intention of phasing out the Army's regimental system, junior defence minister Lord Bach insisted. Where changes are made, famous names, regional identity and traditions will be maintained wherever possible, he said, adding: \"We have no intention of phasing out the regimental system. Its value is not in doubt but it must adapt as it has done in the past.\" </p> <p><b>Gurkhas row</b><br> The government's review of how immigration laws affect former Gurkhas who served with the British Army is \"nearing the point of conclusion\", Home Office minister Des Browne said. He did not want to pre-empt the conclusions of the review ordered 18 months ago after increasing concerns that the rules are unfair to the Nepalese soldiers. His comments came after Tory former Home Office minister Ann Widdecombe raised the plight of the men - around 250 of whom retire each year after 15 years' service - and appealed to the government to show \"basic, common humanity\". </p> <p><b>'Alphabetism'</b><br> Candidates' names should appear in a random order on ballot papers in certain elections to avoid the danger of \"alphabetism\", Labour's Meg Munn urged. She said there was little evidence that someone whose name appeared at the top had any advantage in a contest, such as in a general election, where just one candidate was returned. But there was a danger of bias in polls where more than one was elected. Her representation of the people (ballot papers) bill gained its first reading but is unlikely to become law. </p> <p><b>New peers</b><br>Former governor of the Bank of England Sir Edward George took his Lords seat on the crossbenches as Lord George. Also taking his seat was crossbenches Lord Kerr of Kinlochard - former diplomatic service head Sir John Kerr. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The primemMinister and Tory leader Michael Howard face each other at Commons question time. Earlier Welsh secretary Peter Hain responds to MPs. The hunting bill is set to clear all its stages through the House. There are backbench debates in Westminster Hall. </p> <p>The Lords debates the Christmas Day (trading) bill's report stage, the armed forces (pensions and compensation) bill's third reading, the civil contingencies bill's committee stage and a written constitution.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jo Williams, chief executive of charity Mencap</strong><br> The biggest change over the past 25 years has been that 65,000 people have moved out of hospitals and into the community. This has transformed people's lives and has allowed them to experience things you and I take for granted. It all came out of the 1971 white paper entitled Better Services for the Mentally Handicapped. It has allowed them to choose what they wear and what they eat. They can decide to go out and enjoy local facilities like the shops. It's helped thousands of people feel able to participate and feel they have control over their lives. Having more people in the community makes them feel different about themselves. It gives them more confidence. They start to take more of an interest in things. But unfortunately there are still people in hospital and living in institutions who would choose to live in the community if the support systems were available to them.</p> <p><strong>Richard Best, director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</strong><br>Longer lives, fewer babies. Living longer represents the most fundamental change of the last quarter century. More years on the planet. More chances for fulfilment. But a future 25 years hence with a smaller proportion of workers and taxpayers. And a larger proportion of the population needing pensions and care. Immigration can help change the balance. But longer lives mean we do not vacate our homes so soon. This is adding pressure to the intense shortages of affordable housing. If the country stays rich, we can pay for pensions and care. If taxpayers get less mean, we can do this through the state. Or if we save more and work longer, we may pay for ourselves. But irrespective of the strength of the UK economy, we are more reluctant than 25 years ago to build enough homes for the next generation. And that problem seems destined to get worse - despite the government's good intentions.</p> <p><strong>Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the British Medical Association's general practitioners' committee and a GP in Bridlington, East Yorkshire</strong><br>I entered practice as a GP in 1978 so have had direct experience of the multitude of changes in the health service over the past 25 years. From the market economy of the Thatcher era to the modernisations of the current government, the NHS continues to be a political football. Recently there has been a real increase in resources, but with general practice dealing with more than 90% of all NHS patient contacts, even this welcome increase only starts to address the problems. I'd like to be able to say that family doctors now have an easier life than they did a quarter of a century ago, but while the way we work is changing, there's more to do than ever. Back in 1979, most GPs did their own on-call after a full day in surgery. Those days (and nights) have gone, but nevertheless developments in medicine mean we can now do much more for our patients. But patients' expectations have risen too, sometimes driven up unrealistically by political pronouncements. In April this year a new national GP contract came into force. Over time, it should encourage doctors into general practice and help ease the current shortage. It will deliver higher quality care for patients. It's a real change for the better.</p> <p><strong>James Johnson, chairman of the British Medical Association</strong><br>Over the past 25 years we have seen interminable changes to the way the health service is organised by just about every government that came along. In many instances the changes were a waste of time, effort and money. Successive governments have wrestled with how to pay for the ever more complex issue of medicine. Governments, starting with Mrs Thatcher, have been trying to deal with this by moving away from centralism and bringing in a \"market economy\". The implication of having a market is that on the one hand people can make profits and on the other people who don't succeed go bust. Markets can be vicious. This isn't to say they cannot deliver improvements for patients, but among NHS providers there will be losers as well as winners. The current proposal for a single tariff for NHS work, giving provider status to anyone who meets the standard and can deliver on the price, is the latest \"market\" model for the NHS. There have been tangible improvements for patients over the past 25 years, such as waiting times coming down. Medicine itself has changed. For example, patients used to have operations for peptic ulcers. New drug treatments mean these are now extremely rare. Increased investment in the NHS is perhaps the best change of all.</p> <p><strong>Denise Platt, chairwoman of the Commission for Social Care Inspection</strong><br> One of the most important changes has been the Children Act 1989, which put children firmly at the centre of the agenda. It was a piece of legislation that came in for a lot of PC [politically correct] knocking in its later life, but it was a good start on focusing on the needs of children. Another thing that was significant was Frank Dobson when he was health secretary talking about the Berlin walls in health and social services. It set in train a whole range of decisions about health and social services which isn't completed. And I've also noticed over the past 25 years the increasing impact of inquiries on policy. It's not just Climbi\u00e9, it includes the Bristol hospital inquiry and inquiries into mental health. It's almost as if in the social care field good policy is only developed when something dramatic has happened or the service has gained public attention. Before 1979 there were inquiries but they did not have the same major impact. Unfortunately in some cases they can lead to knee-jerk reactions after specific failings at certain councils are blown up to become a major national issue. But the Climbi\u00e9 inquiry has led the government to take a welcome look at the whole of children's services.</p> <p><strong>Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations</strong><br> Just over 25 years ago the Wolfenden Committee published a report on the future of the voluntary sector which portrayed a vibrant sector that had been enjoying sporadic growth, both in campaigning and service delivery, since the early sixties. The sector's income was estimated to be somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn. There were 120,000 registered charities and an estimated 20,000 paid staff. Recognising the added value that voluntary organisations bring to public services, although they never would have used this New Labour terminology, the committee's key prediction was growth in this area. The 2004 Voluntary Sector Almanac showed that public sector income is now a key driver for the sector and accounts for 37% of the sector's total income. Income is now over \u00a320bn, the voluntary sector workforce now numbers over 500,000 and there are almost 200,000 registered charities. The last quarter century has been dominated by the sector's professionalisation, the formalisation of its relationship with government culminating with the signing of the Compact agreement, as well as growth in political campaigning. Nonetheless, many of the key issues for the future are the same as they were in 1978: independence, infrastructure, maintaining public trust and confidence and balancing the needs of large and small voluntary organisations. </p> <p><strong>Terry Butler, social services director of Hampshire county council</strong><br> I believe the most positive movement we have experienced has been \"user empowerment\", more recently labelled \"choice\" and \"personalisation\". Great strides have been made, but there is still a long way to go. There is no more empowering tool than direct payments. It began in Hampshire about 20 years ago when a group of articulate young men with physical disabilities demanded we gave them the resources to manage their own care. So we \"laundered\" cash through a voluntary organisation and created support worker and personal assistant roles to make it happen. Now direct payments are on the statute book for all user groups. The user movement is still struggling against patronising attitudes, over-bureaucratic restrictions and, more recently, acute risk aversion. At worst, community care \"needs assessments\" for individuals have been become \"risk assessments\", when what we really need are \"potential assessments\" - based on individuals' aspirations, potential and expectations of services. I'm also concerned that, with every agency involved proclaiming themselves \"champion of the users\", what space is left for users to be their own advocates? Nevertheless, the movement continues to gain momentum and now all major political parties place choice at the top of their agendas.</p>",
  "<p><strong> We recently went to an Italian restaurant where one of the starters was deep fried rice balls with a mozzarella centre, and a sauce based, I think, on peppers. It was delicious and I would appreciate any help to create this dish myself. </strong> <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Laura Thompson, London </p> <p>I sought the aid of a veritably award-laden food-writer, Claudia Roden, to identify these delectable deep-fried morsels. </p> <p>The rice balls you tasted, says Roden, were sure to be \"arancini di risu e formaggio\" - a popular Sicilian street food. Old-fashioned friggitori build them the size of small oranges whereas more diminutive specimens are prepared in homes as party fodder. </p> <p>For a starter to serve six: Boil 150g Italian short grain or risotto rice in -litre salted water for 18 minutes until tender. Allow to cool and dry for a few minutes spread out on a plate, then turn into a bowl. Mix in 100g ricotta, 25g grated pecorino or parmesan, two eggs and a good bunch of parsley, finely chopped. </p> <p>Season generously with salt and work well until the mixture sticks together, then work in 100g of chopped mozzarella. </p> <p>Wet your hands and mould the rice into walnut-sized balls. Roll the balls into flour, then into beaten egg and last in fine breadcrumbs. Deep-fry in medium hot oil (sunflower or vegetable) till golden. Don't allow your oil to get too hot as the arancini must be in there for five minutes to allow the cheese to melt, and you don't want them to brown too quickly. </p> <p>Drain on kitchen paper. You can heat them through in the oven when you are ready to dish them up. </p> <p>To vary, you might add a pinch of powdered saffron to the water when boiling the rice. Chopped mint, cooked peas and chopped ham may also added to the rice. </p> <p>Finally, for the sauce: Fry one large chopped onion with 1 chopped red pepper in three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil until very soft but not coloured. Add six peeled and chopped tomatoes, salt and white pepper or a good pinch of chilli pepper. Simmer for 15 - 20 minutes until the sauce is reduced. </p> <p>(Roden's The Food of Italy and Foolproof Mediterranean Cooking are published by Chatto &amp; Windus and BBC books, respectively.) </p> <p><strong> I tried to make an onion tart base from an Elizabeth David recipe - eight ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, and a little water - and every time I rolled the thing out it started coming to pieces, ripping down the middle. I have had similar problems before with sweet short-crust pastry, even when I put it in the fridge before rolling. Is there some trick to keeping all that butter in there while maintaining a coherent dough?</strong><br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Morag James, Fife. </p> <p>The sorry bearer of a broken-tart you may be, Morag, but you are, at least, in excellent company. \"My pastry often tears too,\" admits Tamasin Day-Lewis, \"but I simply patch it together in the tin.\" (\"Books,\" she muses, \"never tell you to do that, as though there's some secret way of rolling it that you just don't get!\") </p> <p>Comforting words, I feel, from the esteemed author of Art of the Tart and Tarts with Tops on - How to make the Perfect pie (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.) </p> <p>The thing is, says Day-Lewis, butter-laden pastry is a thing of great fragility, but you just have to hold your nerve. If, by chance, you don't already use cold ingredients, Day-Lewis finds chilled butter chopped into tiny pieces, worked speedily into the pastry with your fingertips and no more than a tablespoon of ice-cold water, works best. She then pops the ball of pastry, clingfilm-clad, in the fridge for an hour. Any longer and it is too cold to roll and will tear more readily. The dampness of the flour may have some influence too. For a still more buttery-tasting crust, cut the butter into larger chunks and blitz swiftly in a food processor for a few seconds before adding the cold water. </p> <p>Ensure that your rolling pin and rolling surface are well-floured and that the pastry, too, is rolled in flour. Then gently press the rolling pin down on the pastry, turning it as you go and keeping all surfaces well floured. This, says Day-Lewis, is doubtless old news to a seasoned pastry maker, but it works for her. </p> <p>If your pastry still dares to misbehave, use her entirely rule-breaking method; just roll it out as soon as you have made it, placing it VERY loosely in the tin, (as it will shrink), and then stashing in the fridge for an hour or until you want to use it. Then, don't trim it until cooked - that way any shrinkage won't affect the finished tart. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Help! column appears every fortnight.

  "<p><strong> Who's afraid of Mrs T?</strong></p> <p><em>Society Guardian, then called Society Tomorrow, launched on September 19, 1979. In the first article, Malcolm Dean - then, as now, a Guardian leader writer - considered the likely impact of the newly-elected Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. </em></p> <p> If at any other time in the 34 years since the second world war, a column such as this had been launched there was one forecast that could have been confidently predicted about Society Tomorrow. It was going to get better. But for the first time since the founding of the welfare state, this is no longer true. If Mrs Thatcher proceeds with the cuts she has threatened, society today looks far preferable to society tomorrow ... </p> <p>If a Labour government had won in May, there would have been some cuts to services. But nothing like the size of the cuts that the Conservatives have been considering. These are unprecedented. </p> <p>Traditionally, social policy ministers have relied on the expansion of services to establish their reputations. This has been just as true of Conservative ministers as Labour secretaries of state. The biggest applause, for example, at the 1973 Conservative party conference - the last when they were in office - was reserved for Sir Keith Joseph, who was able to proudly tick off six new social security benefits to the delight of the delegates present. (Even then, he conceded, he had not done nearly enough). </p> <p>There is nothing new in this tradition. It was, after all, an annual Conservative conference that imposed on a reluctant party leader ship in 1950 the target of building 300,000 houses a year - a policy that helped Harold Macmillan, who inherited it, eventually to reach Number 10. </p> <p>RA Butler was in a similar situation in 1941. Keen to push forward with his reforms, Butler found his prime minister, [Winston] Churchill, utterly opposed to the reform of secondary education. The Treasury, too, was following its traditional cautious line ... </p> <p>So what did Butler do? ... He proceeded to push ahead and develop the education proposals his civil servants had drawn up. The result? The 1944 Education Act 2, one of the major reforms of the 20th century. </p> <p>So much for prime ministerial dictates. If Churchill can be outflanked, who's afraid of Mrs T? <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Malcolm Dean, September 19, 1979. </p> <p><strong> Computer divorcing</strong> <br><em>The internet revolution was at least 15 years away when we reported in 1982 on the impact of the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES). </em></p> <p> What will happen to social relationships when electronics allow us to communicate easily and cheaply with large numbers of people simultaneously, using our own private message systems? </p> <p>Some insights into the effects of modern communications techniques have now come out of a five-year experiment by the New Jersey Institute of Technology into new ways of letting scientists share their results with each other. </p> <p>Over 1,500 people were provided with terminals (usually like small telex machines) linked by phone line to a central computer, through which messages could be sent to anyone else on the network. </p> <p>It was soon discovered that a whole new medium of communication had been invented, with impact not just on the participants' work but on their whole lives, leading to new personal relationships, new working methods, dependence, addiction, and at least two divorces. </p> <p>Users compose their messages on a keyboard like that of a typewriter, and receive information back either on a linked teleprinter or a screen. They \"log on\" to the system whenever they feel like it by switching on their terminals. The central computer stores the messages, and tells users when they log on what new information is waiting for them. </p> <p>People set up terminals at home as well as in the office so they could use EIES at any hour of the day or night. They changed their working methods so that almost everything they did went through the machine, causing drastic problems whenever there were equipment failures. \"I can't think when the computer is down,\" they would complain. </p> <p>Wives, on the other hand, would complain when the machine was not down. \"You don't talk to me now - you're always on that damned computer,\" was heard a good many times.

We talked to Raza, a young Pakistani officer, about his experiences as a Metropolitan police trainee. </em> </p> <p> Everyone in the group wrote their life history as an essay. This was followed by a talk from each trainee. When Raza's turn came, every person in the room appeared surprised, even shocked. The training sergeant was just as ignorant about his Punjabi village background as the rest. Raza had imagined, vaguely, that police educationalists would have \"done some homework\" about British minority groups. </p> <p>Perhaps it was the training sergeants' lack of \"homework\" that created the habit which upset Raza so greatly at this time. They made it their business to create a constant barrage of remarks of a racial kind ...</p> <p>\"Elephant boy!\" </p> <p>\"You coon!\" </p> <p>His comrades began to use these same terms. If the training sergeants saw fit, then shouldn't they? The official excuse was that this was good conditioning for Raza. </p> <p>\"Get a lot of remarks like this, you will, good hardening for you.\" </p> <p>Raza feels, in retrospect, that the conditioning \"bounced\" back and resulted in his previously well-disposed colleagues accepting a tolerated negative attitude towards minority group members. </p> <p>Raza's depression was worsened by overheard remarks: </p> <p>\"That Paki's failed his exams at Police College once you know.\" </p> <p>\"He's a Muslim, doesn't like women.\" </p> <p>\"Just a wog, like the rest of them.\" </p> <p>He decided to make an effort to counteract the impressions. So far, Raza had escaped making the senior men's breakfast. Now he offered to cook the deeply-loathed bacon. He thought: \"I must get on with them. I chose this job, after all.\" </p> <p>That same morning a WPC remarked that Asian women who give birth to daughters are divorced by their husbands, and the children distributed between the relatives. Raza was so disturbed he could not reply, and left the table hastily. </p> <p>Raza considers himself a competent policeman, in spite of an unsupported training. Hostility in the station is less, racist remarks just as common. A community relations officer informed a group of constables that the West Indian who had been promoted at another station was promoted for political reasons. He wouldn't be clever enough. Wogs aren't, are they? Raza feels the racist attitudes are deeply ingrained, founded in confusion. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Moira Meecham, May 19, 1982. </p> <p><strong> Child care in crisis</strong> <br><em>Relations between social workers and client families were were as fraught in the early 1980s as they are now, as the Guardian's David Hencke discovered. </em></p> <p> About 120 children are taken into care by social services in England and Wales each day. Fewer than 50 of them will leave care within two months, most of whom will return to their parents. </p> <p>Until recently, the remainder might have expected a leisurely assessment, possibly extending into years, while social workers attempted to reunite them with their families. But an increasing number of social services directors are adopting a much tougher line. </p> <p>Spurred on by complaints of inaction, child abuse, wilful neglect and past condemnation by Department of Health and independent inquiries, they often act to break up the family. </p> <p>John Rea Price, director of the London borough of Islington's social care department, put it this way: \"Too many decisions have happened because social workers took non-decisions ... trying to keep families together when it might have been better to make a clean break. Social services is a risk business. We may even sometimes take a wrong decision because we are never certain how things will turn out. </p> <p>\"If one of our decisions unfortunately led to a mother who lost her child throwing herself off the top of a tower block, at least we could say she wasn't carrying the child at the same time.\" </p> <p>It is this sort of strong-mindedness that is bringing a strong reaction ... Some clients [are] unhappy at the way their cases were handled. One woman summed up the lack of communication: \"Social workers - they come to lecture us about our kids. But have you seen their homes? There they all are sitting on bean bags on floorboards, bringing their kids up on vegetarian muck - which the kids hate - then they have the cheek to come round and tell us our carpets are dirty.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> David Hencke, November 3, 1983. </p> <p><strong> My mad, glad, upside down world</strong> <br><em>Bob Holman left academic life to become a community worker on a Glasgow housing estate in 1976. This is his account, in Society Tomorrow in 1986, of the first 10 years. He retired earlier this year. </em></p> <p> As a social scientist, I operated from a top-down perspective. Academics analyse social problems and then try to convince politicians of the steps to improve services. This approach has two flaws. Mixing with the establishment may bring prestige, but it doesn't seem to help the socially deprived very much. </p> <p>Instead, the outcome often seems to be the expenditure of much public money on large buildings and larger salaries for people who already have jobs with, at best, just marginal gains for the poor. Further, the top-down view may not be accurate because its conveyors have separated themselves from the very people in whose interests they claim to speak. </p> <p>Ten years ago, I left a university chair to start a small community project on a council estate. Now I know there is a view from the underside. </p> <p>A friend has had his children removed permanently because he ill-treated them. It is easy for outsiders to condemn him and to recommend regulations and registers for child abusers. But my wife and I stood by him in an almost empty church as he watched the mother of his kids marry another man. I watched his knuckles turn white as he gripped the pew. Rejected, poverty-stricken, he tried to cope with the children. He went to pieces and resorted to drugs. </p> <p>From the underside, I know that he needed money, support and respect. </p> <p>Soon after I moved in, the three Labour councillors called. \"We know what you'll do,\" one declared. \"Stay a year, write a book, and go.\" The remark had the barb of truth, for professional careers - my own included - can be arranged as a series of short stays, each of which is used as a step to higher status and social advancement. </p> <p>Ten years later, I know there is something to be said for staying. </p> <p>Twice a week, I visit a pensioner still shaken by the death of his wife. He worries about the price of coal. He has exchanged his colour television for a black and white one. I can't do much for him, but he gets upset if I don't call. That means staying. But the staying is also the happiness. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, a young boy said: \"Bob, we've been talking about you in the street and we're all going to come to your funeral.\" I hope it is not an immediate prophesy. But at least he thinks I'll still be in this neighbourhood when I die. I hope so. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Bob Holman, March 26, 1986. </p> <p><strong> Big Brother's invisible ball and chain</strong> <br><em>The soaring prison population in the 1980s generated interest in alternatives to jail. We reported the arrival of a US solution - electronic tagging. </em></p> <p> Tomorrow's world of electronic incarceration has arrived. One by one, at a session at the recent American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago, the inventors and the marketing chiefs proudly displayed their wares. </p> <p>David J Hunter, president and chief executive of BI Inc, was there promoting a device trademarked as the BI Home Escort, which at the moment is detaining hundreds of prisoners in their own homes in Michigan. </p> <p>The \"electronic shackle\" is a uniquely encoded, tamper-proof radio beacon fitted to the offender's ankle. It communicates with a receiver fitted in his home. Wearing the anklet, the offender can play football with his children, wash the dishes, watch TV, take a bath. But if he strays more than 150 feet from the receiver, off go the alarm bells in a justice department control centre. </p> <p>The device has a bizarre genesis. The idea occurred to Judge Jack Love, of Albuquerque, who took it from a Spiderman comic and then pursued it when a number of petty offenders locked up in the New Mexico state penitentiary were killed in a prison riot; it seemed improper to him that, in effect, they had received the death sentence for minor crimes. </p> <p>Officialdom endorsed the idea because of the appaling overcrowding in American prisons: in January, Texas released 200 felons because it had nowhere to put them; in Louisiana, the gaolers resolved the problem only by shoving the prisoners into tents in the prison yard. Then there is the money. Prisons cost about $125,000 per prisoner to build and $95 per day per prisoner to run. Electronic home arrest costs $10 a day, and clears the prisons of the embezzler, the drunken driver and the salmon poacher to make room for the arsonist, the rapist and the killer. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Tim Radford, April 1, 1987. </p> <p><strong> I've got Aids</strong> <br><em>As the emergence of Aids triggered a sexual health panic in the second half of the 1980s, we ran occasional extracts from the diary of Chris Dale. In this excerpt, Dale tells his family he is HIV positive. </em></p> <p> \"So, what's this thing you've got?\" asked my father late in the evening. The moment had arrived; I could avoid it no longer. </p> <p>\"Well, actually, Dad, I've not told you everything so far. You see, the reason there's been such a problem shifting this Isospora is that I'm partially immune suppressed.\" </p> <p>\"What does that mean?\" </p> <p>\"I'm HIV positive.

However, it does mean that my resistance to infection has been lowered. And I could get Aids in the future - no one knows.

I've now been given a similar warning: look after my health or run the risk of developing full-blown Aids.\" </p> <p>\"For God's sake, don't tell Mum. It'll kill her.\" The reaction was the same as three years previously when I'd first told him I was gay, the feeling again that ignorance was less upsetting than knowledge. </p> <p>The conversation dribbled on. When had I caught it? Did William have it? How had he caught it? I lied here a little. William and I had decided from the start that nothing could be gained by trying to calculate who'd infected the other. But now, to protect William, I claimed that I had contracted the infection before meeting him and had subsequently infected him. Whilst Dad was out with the dog, Mum came and asked me how I felt. I started the conversation as I had with my father, but as soon as the word \"Aids\" came up, she walked away, saying: \"I don't want to know any more; I don't want to talk about it.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Chris Dale (pseudonym), June 3, 1987.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Part-time places</strong> <br><em>By the late 1980s, changes to the urban environment - triggered by a combination of Thatcherite market forces and the explosion of consumerism - were beginning to be noticed. </em> </p> <p> The spectre of revolution is once again haunting Britain. Now it is the retail revolution that could leave many towns and cities as shattered as if a political revolution had occurred. The third term of a Conservative government committed to allowing market forces to set the terms of regional and local social and economic development may affect civic life and architecture as profoundly as the industrial revolution did. </p> <p>Between 1960 and 1980, the number of supermarkets increased by 2,000%, and now these are being made redundant by superstores and the \"third wave\" development of out-of-town retail warehouses. If these schemes are approved, and mergers continue, we may not be able to tell one town from another before very long. But lack of individual civic identity is only one of the problems. </p> <p>The urban riots of 1981 and 1983 didn't just happen in decaying inner-city areas. Over the past decade, most new towns have experienced fairly serious outbreaks of rioting (which often never reached the national press) and these usually occurred in or around the new shopping centres. In many places I visited, there was an almost palpable hostility between those out spending with credit cards and those with UB40s and nothing to do but watch. In Oxford earlier this year, it was reported that the pedestrian shopping precinct had been the scene of frequent, and often quite violent, street clashes. </p> <p>The real tragedy is that where once cities and towns were places for all kinds of activities - cinemas, dance halls, museums and galleries, pubs and restaurants, cafes, theatres, meetings, open air rallies, promenading, window shopping - the retail revolution has given them one overriding purpose: shopping. Not to have a high disposable income and a credit card is now to be almost dis enfranchised from the civic culture. </p> <p>Pleasurable though it is, there must be more to life than shopping.<br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ken Worpole, September 16, 1987. </p> <p><strong> Yours sincerely, FG Pink</strong> <br><em>In 1990, we published extracts from correspondence between Graham Pink, a charge nurse on the geriatric wards at Stepping Hill hospital, Stockport, and his managers, about low staffing levels. Pink was sacked for speaking out, but later won compensation for wrongful dismissal. His story, brought to light by the Guardian's David Brindle, triggered a national debate over 'whistleblowing' in the NHS. </em> </p> <p> <strong> August 24, 1989.</strong> Dear Mr R, On Monday, 10 out of the 24 patients were incontinent - a not unusual situation. One gentleman, in his 100th year, was changed nine times, and when we departed at 8am was lying in a wet bed once more. Another had a massive bowel movement, then, in his derangement, proceeded to wipe the faeces over his head, face, body, down his excessively long finger nails (nail care went out years ago, I'm told), the locker and cot sides. It took two of us 20 minutes to make him warm and comfortable. During this time, we were out of sight and earshot of half the ward and we were the only two on duty at the time. </p> <p>There is so much more that you ought to know of: avoidable injuries to patients (including a death); patients offered a wash once a day! (would you eat your breakfast not having washed your hands for 22 hours?); a very feeble and ill lady being pushed into the dayroom on admission and left there for an hour because a corpse was in the bed she was to occupy (while I had to lie to the relatives). </p> <p>It amounts to a catalogue of shame and neglect which must be brought into the open for our whole community to know of if need be. </p> <p><strong> November 13.</strong> Dear Mr G, What more can I say to convince you? Relate another alarming experience, perhaps? </p> <p>The experience occurred whilst I was alone on the ward; alone, that is, with 20 stricken and vulnerable patients. Two ladies were on commodes and a third had called me. As I jerked and heaved Mrs Gowen (a dense stroke patient) towards the edge of the bed, I heard receding footsteps unsteadily shuffling along the ward, followed by the opening of the main ward door. Someone was leaving and it could only be a patient. Pulling back the curtains, I saw one of our confused ladies on the corridor. Immediately outside the door is a steep flight of stairs ... Realising that for Mrs Gowen to fall to the floor was potentially less life-threatening than what could happen at any moment on the stairs, I left her precariously perched and rushed out of the ward to grab Mrs Neal. I could not reason with her or persuade her back. Meanwhile, the ward door had swung to, leaving the patients, two on commodes calling out, one likely to fall, alone and unattended. </p> <p>And you, Mr G, believe our staffing levels do not put patients in danger. Can we be using the same language, I wonder? <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Graham Pink, April 11, 1990. </p> <p><strong> Run of the river</strong> <br><em>The 1990s saw new attempts to regenerate the great post-industrial cities. Glasgow was designated European capital of culture. Peter Hetherington, then the Guardian's Scotland correspondent, went on walkabout in the city. </em> </p> <p> In the Glasgow suburb of Bridgeton, once represented by the old Red Clydesider Jimmy Maxton, two retired engineers lament the passing of industry in the east end of their city, this year's European Culture Capital. \"Where are the jobs for those youngsters?\" asks John Forrester, pointing to a squad of teenagers. \"Ach, it's better than the thirties and forties,\" says Jackie Stewart. \"But culture? Fine if you've got plenty of money, but if you've got none where's the culture?\" </p> <p>Clydeside's city has spent around \u00a320m on a year-long spectacle of music, dance, theatre, opera and exhibitions. To critics, the extravaganza is an insult to the city's heritage: a \"cultural con\", complained the placards of demonstrators when an ambitious people's exhibition, Glasgow's Glasgow, was opened. To Farquhar McClay, editor of the book Workers' City, Glasgow has become a \"happy-land of yuppiedom, a grotesquerie where the young, upwardly-mobile middle class with fat salaries and expensive tastes are to be the centrepiece and soul ... the wine bar economy is all we've got and it's flourishing.\" </p> <p>The Glasgow of 1990 appears a paradox: corporate wealth and power (over 100 new and emerging office developments, Japanese money and all, worth over \u00a31bn) amassed alongside the same old inner-city areas, where little changes. </p> <p>This year, the city will pay \u00a3151m to service a housing debt of \u00a31.1bn for its 168,000 houses, the largest council stock in Britain. Over 20,000 of them are below tolerable standards, while 60,000 need urgent treatment for dampness. </p> <p>Jim Sillars, MP for Glasgow Govan, recalls a recent meeting with an anxious tenant. \"Culture,\" she said. \"I know all about it. I've had it growing on my wall for years.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Peter Hetherington, August 8, 1990. </p> <p><strong> Welcome to Britain</strong> <br><em>In 1994, asylum seekers rioted at Campsfield immigration centre near Oxford. Guardian reporter Ed Pilkington visited the centre undercover. </em></p> <p> As soon as Mobali arrived at Heathrow airport from South Africa he was picked up by immigration officers. Since then, his view of Britain has been restricted to glimpses of trees snatched through the fences of seven different custodial institutions. From the latest, Campsfield, all you can see from the windows is a green perimeter wall topped by barbed wire. </p> <p>In 13 months, Mobali has seen several men crack under the strain. Some, defeated, have requested to be sent back to their native country. But others, for whom the thought of facing renewed persecution is too painful to contemplate, have no such safety valve. </p> <p>At dinner one evening, Mobali saw a Romanian detainee climb on top of the table. He started singing and dancing hysterically, then threw his food all over the room. Another friend, with no previous history of illness, has been confined almost constantly to the hospital ward since he was detained. When people have been pushed by fear and boredom so close to the edge, it does not take much to tip them over. The roof-top protest at Campsfield is believed to have been triggered by news that a fellow detainee, an Algerian, Ali Tamarat, was about to be deported. Empathy with his plight rapidly turned into anger, anger into violence. </p> <p>Mobali describes Campsfield as a hotel compared to some of the institutions he has seen. The Group 4 guards are courteous and the facilities reasonable. But he is inconsolable. \"I cannot dream any more. I sleep long hours, then sometimes I cannot sleep at all. But I never dream.\" </p> <p>He is constantly pondering his fate, his mind a whirl of hopes and fears. The question that comes back to haunt him with punishing regularity is when, if ever, will he be safe. He has been through an arduous legal treadmill to claim asylum, months of appeals and counter-appeals, and still there is no end in sight. The Court of Appeal recently granted him leave to stay in Britain, but the Home Office would not rest at that. It has insisted on appealing against the appeal, in an Alice Through The Looking Glass world where no decision, however straightforward, is ever final. </p> <p>\"I haven't come here for a good life, for food or for shelter.

All I want is protection and freedom.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ed Pilkington, June 8, 1994. </p> <p><strong> Time of grief </strong> <br><em>In 1998, Society Guardian published an account of prison life by Erwin James, entitled Diary of a Prison Inmate. The column transferred to the Guardian's G2 section as A Life Inside, and was published as a book of the same name. </em> </p> <p> I thought I had become hardened to self-inflicted death in prison - until Michael died. He was in a cell seven doors down from mine. One Sunday afternoon, at around 2.30, he was found hanging from the bars of his cell window. Several days later, the prison authorities allowed his two sisters and his mother to go into the cell where he had died. </p> <p>They pressed their hands and their faces against the wall underneath the window and called out his name in anguish. The other prisoners had been left unlocked, and, as the women wept, many stood by their doors in respectful silence. In an unprecedented gesture of compassion, the prison governor allowed Michael's family to leave wreaths by his cell door. </p> <p>This was like a revelation - an official acknowledgement of Michael's humanity. The usual procedure had always been for the dead man's cell to be cleaned and re-occupied the next day, even the same day. But Michael's wreaths were left outside the sealed cell door for over a week, accompanied by a lighted candle. </p> <p>In the prison chapel the following Sunday morning, the chaplain read out a letter from one of Michael's sisters in which she thanked his \"mates\" for their courtesy during the family visit to his cell. She was glad that \"at least he had some good mates in there\". I could not hold back my tears as I listened to her words. </p> <p>The sense of my own humanity had been dulled over many years of living in an environment where human dignity is routinely forsaken and where a suicide merits less as a topic of discussion than who's managed to smuggle in a \"parcel\" (drugs). Barely noticing, I'd sunk deeper and deeper into a mire of cynicism. But Michael's death and the authorities' humane response pulled me back. </p> <p>I hope that the call by the Chief Inspector of Prisons to carry out an urgent review of suicide-awareness strategies delivers a similar message to the outside world. The news that those in prison are six times more likely to commit suicide than those on the outside, and the fact that last year's shameful figure of 83 prison suicides in England and Wales is an all-time record, should bring an end to the era of complacency. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Erwin James, January 14, 1998. </p> <p><strong> Childhood - the final reckoning</strong> <br><em>In 1995, Barnardo's allowed people who had been in their care to freely access their own files.

I didn't know what the loose collection of photocopied pages would contain. It was to be a story of racial prejudice, human frailty, bitterness, compassion and sadness. </p> <p>My mother, frightened of her mother discovering the pregnancy, went to stay in a \"Magdalene laundry\" home for unmarried mothers in Cornwall. There, under the Christian Moral Welfare Society, she did penance scrubbing floors and the like. </p> <p>Within three months, my mother applied for me to be taken by Barnardo's. The Barnardo's reports say: \"Any physical defects or maladies: Half-Caste.\" When I was a year old, their reports said I couldn't be put up for adoption because \"he is such a poor specimen of humanity and there are doubts about his intelligence\". </p> <p>My mother resumed her teaching in Birmingham and successfully fought for me to be moved from a home in Devon to one closer to her. \"He is all that I have,\" she wrote, adding, \"I hope to have him with me in a few years.\" But by the time I was two years old my mother was reported as saying that she could no longer see me. She was getting married and her husband-to-be was too jealous. Too jealous of a 24-month-old little boy! </p> <p>At three, I was moved to foster care in Bolton. After my mother died, one of my godmothers would tell me that my mother tried to keep in contact but the letters were blocked and it was too far for her to travel. I was angry at Barnardo's for their callousness. Now I've seen Barnardo's letters requesting my mother to write to me, even visit. Barnardo's tried after all. In vain. </p> <p>At seven, I fractured my skull in a road accident and spent some time in a coma. My mother was contacted. \"I'd rather forget about him,\" my mother is said to have responded. She had married and nailed down the coffin of her past. Reading that hurt. Like I was in the coffin. </p> <p>The old ones say that it is understandable. A lot of it happened back then, they say. My mother had had a hard time. Estranged from her rabid, racist mother, abused as a child by her music teacher, she had finally found a chance of happiness with her husband. What else could she do? the old ones ask. </p> <p>I'll never know quite what my mother thought of what she did. Sometimes it seems like I caused the pain. Like I was to blame.

The council and police don't know about many of the places where the homeless sleep. There's a derelict barge on the river somewhere, and an old hut by the railway station.\" </p> <p>\"Is that the one where you can hear all the rats?\" asks one person begging at the University Church. \"Nah,\" replies Sam, \"they've found another since then.\" </p> <p>One place I especially wanted to see was described to me as a strange hole in a wall, where you have to squeeze through a narrow gap to get inside. It is apparently behind a lamp post, but nobody would tell me where in case the word got out. </p> <p>In the absence of a winter shelter, it is particularly important that the best locations remain secret. </p> <p>The other week, at the beginning of the rain storms, the police said that anyone found sleeping on the underground floors of the covered car park near Emmanuel College would be arrested. This was especially bad news because the subterranean floors are among the most popular spots in the city, with up to 15 people sleeping there. They are warm, quiet and almost safe.</p> <p>Then there are the locked places, which nobody thinks the homeless have a key to. As the weather worsens, the fuller they become. Sam knocks on one of them. \"Bunker, it's Sam,\" he shouts. I can hear faint voices, but nobody responds. \"They won't answer,\" explains Sam. \"The homeless don't believe that anyone would do anything for them. They think you want to steal their sleeping bags. They think you're the police.\" There is a medieval quality about street life here - not just in the way these people live, but in the brute intensity of their fears: money, sex and death, in that order.</p> <p>It is standard for somebody to come on to Sam's wife when they are out begging. \"If you let your girlfriend suck me off, I'll give you a fiver.\" You get that one about every half hour, Sam says. The other day, a man offered her a flat. \"Don't mind about the rent,\" he said. \"Just move in and we'll come to some arrangement.\"</p> <p>He and his wife cannot get work because no employer will take them without an address. They cannot get an address because landlords demand a deposit and a month's payment in advance.

  "<p>Commissions of inquiry into this or that can often be disappointing affairs, especially when they lack official authority. But the independent commission on the future of the voluntary sector in England, which reported in 1996, has come to be seen as a model of its kind. Much of what it proposed has already come to pass and the sector now stands on the brink of legislative reform that could prove a historic legacy. </p> <p>\"We had no status at all,\" recalls Nicholas Deakin, who chaired the commission set up by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. \"We paraded round the country and people came and talked to us. It was an act, in a way, of enormous arrogance to expect that people would respond to us, but they did.\" </p> <p>Those were the dying days of Conservative rule and it is easy, in retrospect, to think that change was in the air and the commission was playing sweet music to an appreciative Labour gallery. Not so, insists Deakin. After four straight Tory general election victories, he and his colleagues were counting no unhatched political chickens: the commission went out of its way to write a report directed as much at the then government as at Tony Blair's opposition. Besides, Labour had proved itself to be no great friend. </p> <p>\"When I was a voluntary sector regional chair in the Midlands in the 1980s, the bane of my life was Labour councils that would have nothing to do with voluntary sector bodies, which they associated with Tory ladies in flowery hats and that sort of stuff,\" Deakin says. </p> <p>\"The Tories were almost equally patronising - you know, 'our little helper'. 'We can entrust you with various things; we'll contract with you to make sure you deliver [public services]; but come near us to talk about policy - not a chance.'\" </p> <p>In the event, and very much in that caricature, Conservative ministers rejected the commission's call for government action to improve its relations with the voluntary sector while endorsing what was said about the need for change in the sector itself. \"That was extremely helpful, because it sort of severed us from the Tories,\" says Deakin. By contrast, Labour's then spokesman on the sector, Alun Michael, committed his party to the whole package. </p> <p>In fact, Deakin and Michael had been meeting from time to time during the commission's year-long work. Deakin is a self-effacing sort - he volunteers, for instance, that he was not first choice to lead the inquiry - but undoubtedly his experience played a key role in preparing the ground so fruitfully for the voluntary sector. For while he was at the time professor of social policy and administration at Birmingham University, and was best known for his academic work on the inner cities and race, he had been a Whitehall civil servant and had led the central policy unit at the former Greater London Council. </p> <p>Now in his late 60s, Deakin retires at the end of this month from his last academic post as visiting professor at the centre for civil society at the London School of Economics. It would be a fitting postscript to his career if the draft charities bill were to become law, reforming the legal and regulatory regimes for charities very much in the way the commission envisaged. But he is very worried that it will not. </p> <p>The problem is the confusion over the \"public benefit\" test at the heart of the bill and, specifically, whether it could trump case law in respect of existing charities charging high fees, such as private schools and hospitals. Despite an agreement unveiled in the past few days, by which the charity commission accepts that case law would not prevent the test being applied to schools, Deakin is unconvinced that the issue is settled. </p> <p>The agreement, he says, \"seems too much like a hasty fudge instead of a consistent approach that sets a clear framework\". He thinks there should be a clear definition of public benefit on the face of the bill, making a proper base for modern charity law that brings about substantive change, rather than merely repeating what already exists in common law. </p> <p>\"People like me who have been on the fringes of it get terribly impatient with charity law and the way in which the framework just doesn't fit the interests of all those involved - except charity lawyers,\" he says. \"I don't think the charity commission is obfuscating and this is a genuine difficulty - going retrospectively into the credentials of all those very powerful organisations really is a wasps' nest - but, for God's sake, it ought to be soluble.\" </p> <p>Until, and unless, there is legislation, the biggest single change associated with Deakin's commission is the \"compact\" between the government and the voluntary sector and the mini versions at local level. This approach was forged against a background in the 1980s of what he describes as \"extreme anxiety\" about the contract culture, and what it was doing to the voluntary ethos, as the Tory government sought to use charities to deliver policy programmes that Labour councils were boycotting. Anxiety remains, and Deakin stresses that charities entering contracts need their wits about them, but he gives the compact seven out of 10 for what it has done to build a better, two-way relationship. </p> <p>\"Reciprocity is crucial and the government has delivered on that impressively,\" he says, though adding that full delivery had to wait until Labour had got over its initial dirigiste phase of suffocating central control. \"Senior voluntary sector figures are now familiar faces around the Whitehall corridors. It may not be down to the compact as a document, but it is down to the atmosphere that the compact symbolises.\" </p> <p>Another key recommendation of the 1996 commission - and one that Deakin, writing in Society Guardian at the time, described as being the most ambitious - was to promote the role of voluntary action in rebuilding civic culture. To Deakin's delight, this is a theme picked up recently by David Blunkett, the home secretary, and Deakin is serving on a steering group looking into the idea of an active citizenship centre. \"In many respects it's an agenda I'm very happy with,\" he says. \"It exactly reflects the concerns we had eight years ago about the value of voluntary action, not just in an instrumental way, a service delivery way, but in creating a new civil consciousness.\" </p> <p>The downside for Deakin is the association of this agenda with what he calls the home secretary's \"extremely negative\" messages on refugees and asylum seekers, public safety and crime. He worries also that, in cabinet terms, it appears to be one person's agenda and therefore acutely vulnerable to a reshuffle. \"But we compromise, don't we? It might continue; it may be that this is important enough in terms of New Labour priorities and should not be doubted.\" </p> <p>Would compromise be acceptable to save the charities bill? \"What I don't like is the idea of having got it all set up, and properly prepared, and then to be wasting this once-in-a-generation opportunity,\" says Deakin. \"That's what's getting me in all this. </p> <p>\"Would a sort of half-cocked bill be better than nothing?

  "More than 1,000 illegal migrants have been arrested following random swoops on tube passengers and pedestrians in London, Home Office figures showed last night. <p>The figures showed the joint exercises by the police and immigration service have become a regular weekday event in the capital with 235 operations mounted in the last 15 months.</p> <p>Ministers have ordered the trawl for failed asylum seekers as part of their attempt to step up the return of illegal migrants to their home countries.</p> <p>Last month's asylum figures showed the number of failed asylum seekers removed from Britain fell by 18% compared with the same period in 2003.</p> <p>The Home Office is to bring in powers stripping failed asylum seekers with young children of council accommodation and welfare benefits in an effort to step up the rate of removals.</p> <p>The exercise, running since last May, involves immigration staff stopping anyone they consider to look or sound a possible illegal migrant, asking them about their nationality and to produce papers to prove their right to be in Britain.</p> <p>Some of those stopped have been overheard speaking a non-European language.</p> <p>The spot checks have been carried around \"crime hotspots\" and among passengers on the London Underground with the support of the British Transport police.</p> <p>The figures showed that those arrested included 717 failed asylum seekers but thousands more people have been stopped and questioned by immigration staff using powers which the police are banned from using.</p> <p>Des Browne, the immigration minister, in a Commons written answer published yesterday, defended the operation saying the use of immigration staff in public places was a legitimate activity to enforce the immigration laws.</p> <p>\"While immigration officers do not have the same powers as the police to stop and search individuals in public places, they may legitimately question people to determine their immigration status where there is reasonable suspicion that a person is an immigration offender,\" he said.</p> <p>But the Liberal Democrats protested strongly at the practice.</p> <p>Mark Oaten, the party's home affairs spokesman, said: \"Trawling public places for failed asylum seekers is a clumsy attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted.</p> <p>\"It is the job of the Home Office to keep track of asylum seekers and to remove them if they fail to win refugee status.\"</p> <p>He said that unlike some other countries, Britain did not have a history of randomly stopping thousands of black and Asian people to check whether they were illegal migrants.</p> <p>\"In order to catch 1,000 illegal immigrants, many thousands of law-abiding citizens will have been stopped on the basis of their skin colour and their accent alone,\" he said.</p> <p>\"That is unacceptable and will cause real damage to race relations,\" he added.</p>",
  "Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, expressed his \"concern\" last week that Israeli expansion of illegal West Bank colonies threatens the viability of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians welcome such concern, but wonder what the British government intends to do about it. <p>Mr Straw's concern is well-founded. Israeli colonies - illegally built in occupied Palestinian territory and often on land confiscated from Palestinians - have long obstructed a negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Currently, more than 400,000 settlers inhabit nearly 200 colonies scattered throughout the occupied territories, including east Jerusalem. Integrated into Israel by \"Israeli-only\" roads and electricity grids, the colonies are strategically placed to fragment Palestinian communities, control water resources and frustrate any true exercise of Palestinian nationhood. </p> <p>The erection of Israel's wall, spun as a \"security\" measure, is simply the latest strategy in consolidating Israel's hold over its colonies. Unsurprisingly, the wall is not built on Israel's 1967 pre-occupation border but well within occupied Palestinian territory and in such a way as to maximise the number of Palestinians behind the wall while allowing more than 80% of the settlers to remain. </p> <p>Mr Straw astutely expressed the fear that the colonies would soon detach east Jerusalem from the West Bank. But this detachment has already in effect been realised. Palestinian east Jerusalem has been strangled by the wall and two circles of Israeli colonies. The city has begun to wither: Palestinian schools now lack teachers; churches are in need of priests; and the infirm can no longer get access to clinics or hospitals. As a result, Palestinian east Jerusalem has witnessed an exodus of the indigenous Christian and Muslim population, which Israel does not regret. </p> <p>In July, the international court of justice (ICJ) unanimously reaffirmed that Israel's West Bank colonies and the wall violate international law. Along with the 24 other members of the European Union, Britain endorsed the ICJ's ruling. Nevertheless, the colonies continue to expand. Since the ruling, Israel has authorised the construction of more than 2,300 new housing units in the occupied Palestinian territories. These new units, which are heavily subsidised by the Israeli government, could house more than 8,000 new Jewish settlers from around the world, while local Christian and Muslim Palestinians would be forced into ever-shrinking reservations and ghettoes. </p> <p>As Mr Straw is certainly aware, Israel's colonies are nothing new. And as every Palestinian is aware, international \"concern\" over Israeli colonisation - inevitably followed by non-action and eventual acquiescence - is not new either. During the Oslo process, the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and even the United States condemned Israeli colonisation as illegal or against the interests of peace. During the same years, the number of Israeli settlers living in the colonies doubled. </p> <p>To save the prospect of Israel and Palestine living side by side, in peace and security, the United Kingdom and the EU must hold Israel accountable for its failure to abide by international law. Every pressure, whether economic or diplomatic, must be exerted to encourage Israel to reverse its colonisation policies.</p> <p>The EU's reluctance to take decisive action in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not only teaches Israel that the EU can be ignored, but also it sullies the laudable values of freedom and the rule of law that the EU seeks to promote. There is an inherent contradiction in supporting the ICJ decision and opposing Israel's illegal colonies, while simultaneously providing Israel with preferential trade relations in the form of the EU-Israel association agreement. By doing nothing to end \"the apartheid regime\" in the Palestinian Territories, which \"is worse than the one that existed in South Africa\" - as described by John Dugard, South African law professor and special rapporteur for the UN on human rights in the Palestinian territories - the EU erodes its international credibility as a non-biased facilitator of peace while placing itself squarely in opposition to democracy, freedom and law enforcement. This is hardly the kind of policy that would induce Ariel Sharon to take the EU seriously. Indeed, he does not. </p> <p>The United States continues to teach Israel that it is above the law - and we have seen the disastrous results. The UK and its EU partners should take a different approach. A good start might be for the EU to stop economically rewarding Israel for its continued snubbing of the rule of law and take concrete actions to ensure compliance with the ICJ. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"http://www.nad-plo.org\">Dr Saeb Erekat</a> is the chief Palestinian negotiator</p>"
