  "It could have been all so different, and for a time it was. Like young Australians for generations, I left home as soon as I could - in my case, 1983 - to see what the world had to offer. While it was a great place to grow up, as adulthood beckoned, everything big seemed to be happening elsewhere. <p>I went to London to work as a journalist, and thought little about home until I took a holiday back there in the late Eighties. </p> <p>I was unprepared for what I found. Australia had grown from an insular backwater into a vibrant, sophisticated, cosmopolitan society. </p> <p>It had achieved remarkable success in assimilating people from all round the world, who left old animosities behind to embrace a distinctly Australian openness. </p> <p>Whereas a few years earlier they would envy you a London life, now they pitied you. 'Why the hell would you want to be there when you could be here?' they asked. </p> <p>Looking round the great cities of Sydney and Melbourne, they had a point. Everything was cleaner, fresher and more vibrant down under than in Europe. </p> <p>The beach was there, of course, but more sophisticated pleasures had been added. The arts were flourishing. Australians were coming to terms with their sometimes unattractive past. There was general agreement that there must be reconciliation with the long-suffering Aborigines. There was growing enthusiasm for an amicable break with the monarchy and a belief, even among older Australians, that a republic was a positive step. </p> <p>In the early Nineties, I moved to Bangkok. There I discovered another dimension to the new Australia. Paul Keating's high-profile drive to engage with Asia was attracting attention - and not just in the business community. High-profile projects such as the Australian-funded bridge across the Mekong were well-received. Taxi drivers would smile and say with some surprise, 'Australia number one. Australia likes Asia.' American journalist friends would eschew US embassy briefings for Australian - not just more informative but a lot more fun. </p> <p>It was remarkable. I began to feel it was time to return to take part belatedly in this remarkable renaissance. My timing could not have been worse. </p> <p>I could not wrap up affairs in Bangkok until after the 1996 election punished Keating for his arrogance and swept Howard to power in a rancorous campaign which saw race become an election issue for the first time since the White Australia Policy began to be dismantled in 1958. </p> <p>It was the election that brought One Nation Party leader Pauline Hanson to parliament on a ticket of anti-immigration, anti-Aboriginal aid and anti-globalisation. </p> <p>My first inkling that something was going wrong came in Bangkok at a meeting of the Australian business community addressed by the new Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, on a stopover to London - his first official trip overseas. </p> <p>In front of the embarrassed Australians - many his own party's supporters - and baffled Thais, Downer claimed that Australia under Keating had concentrated too much effort and rhetoric on Asia. This had distracted us from our older friends in Britain and there would be a rebalancing of priorities. </p> <p>Back in Australia, Hanson, who said she represented the 'white community' and everyone, 'apart from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders', had just made her maiden speech attacking her favourite targets. Howard refused to condemn her, instead turning his venom on 'political correctness' and adding: 'I thought some of the things she said were an accurate reflection of what people feel.' </p> <p>Howard's support rose overnight and the atmosphere of Australia changed almost as quickly. An emboldened Howard moved on with his mean-spirited agenda, refusing to officially apologise to Aborigines for the generation of children taken from them by the state. The republican cause was canned. </p> <p>Howard's brutal policy on asylum seekers, pursued with indecent relish by Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock, kept Australians fearful of an invasion - although the numbers, some 3,000, were laughably small. Hundreds of children were imprisoned, along with their families, in desert detention centres. </p> <p>Australians, who a few years before had apparently relished ethnic differences, became more openly racist. Polls showed racial intolerance, especially against Muslims, growing. A cardiac surgeon, during Australia's 'friendly' Olympics, told me in a Sydney bar that if it was up to him he'd 'drop the big one and turn the Middle East into a glass car park - that'd stop the bastards coming'. </p> <p>For me, the final straw was the so-called 'children overboard' affair. On the eve of the last national poll in October 2001, a group of 200 desperate asylum-seekers, mainly Iraqis, jumped with their children from a sinking boat off the Australian coast. </p> <p>Within hours, Howard and Ruddock were relaying a very different version of events. There was no mention of sinking ships. Australians were told the 'illegal immigrants' had thrown their children in the sea to force a nearby frigate to pick them up. </p> <p>Now, back in Bangkok, there are no briefings for US journalists at the Australian embassy, and taxi drivers tell me: 'Australia. Same, same America.'</p>",
  "<p>John Winston Howard, Australia's 'little battler' Prime Minister, is facing the political battle of his life as he attempts to come from behind in the polls to win his fourth mandate from voters on 9 October, calling on the electorate to trust his economic management and security credentials. </p> <p>Even by the rough-and-tumble standards of politics Down Under, the first week of the six-week campaign got off to a bitter start, with the Prime Minister being distracted by claims from within his conservative Liberal National Party coalition party that that he is a 'low-life, lying rodent'. </p> <p>Howard, 65, whose sobriquets of 'little Johnnie' or the 'battler' give him a blokey appeal in the nation's crucial outer suburbs, is a wily veteran of more than 30 turbulent years in federal politics. </p> <p>He is seeking what is believed to be a last endorsement from the electorate before retiring as the second-longest serving Prime Minister in Australian history and handing over to his current Treasurer, Peter Costello. </p> <p>For the past eight years Howard has been able to maintain the support of the nation's conservative heartland with his commitment to the Commonwealth and the Queen, rigid ties with the US, a tough stance on asylum seekers, and a strong economic record that has delivered low inflation, near-full employment and sustained growth. </p> <p>Critics pillory the former suburban solicitor as the grey man of Aussie politics, whose craven pursuit of the US alliance landed Australia in the increasingly unpopular Iraq conflict, disengaged the nation from its Asian neighbours, widened the gap between rich and poor, and damaged Australia's reputation with its harsh treatment of illegal immigrants. </p> <p>His adversary is new Australian Labour Party leader Mark Latham, 43. Since his surprise appointment 10 months ago, Latham has invigorated his party and won points from the government by forcing amendments to Australia's free trade deal with the US and pushing healthcare up the political agenda. </p> <p>Latham, who is more akin to John Prescott than Tony Blair, is promising a more egalitarian nation by focusing on what he calls a 'ladder of opportunity', that would deliver better health and education and more accessible housing. </p> <p>'Biffo' Latham, famed for an early-morning brawl with a Sydney taxi driver, is criticised by opponents as a bullying larrakin, a profligate administrator, a republican and a foul-mouthed adversary who remains untested over a long election campaign.</p> <p>He raised eyebrows in Washington with his earthy description of President George Bush as the 'most incompetent and dangerous President in living memory' and attracted criticism for his unparliamentary description of his conservative opponents as a 'conga line of suckholes'. Whether his current lead in the election campaign is due to Howard-fatigue, or an ability to touch a popularist vein will be tested as pressure builds to release his tax, family assistance plans and fiscal priorities. </p> <p>Howard is a poor campaigner who, during his past three campaigns - all under very different circumstances - has overseen a deterioration in the coalition's core vote.</p> <p>There is also disunity within his ranks, and the threat of open revolt about the dumping of an incumbent member of parliament for Malcolm Turnbull, former chief of investment bank Goldman Sachs' Australian operation. Turnbull achieved fame as the barrister who defeated the British government in the Spycatcher case.</p> <p>So far the stock market and Australian currency have largely ignored the promises and threats emanating from both sides of the political fence. The stock market last week hit record highs after a bumper corporate reporting season that featured high dividends, strong earnings and upbeat forecasts. </p> <p>Investors do not seem too worried and analysts are generally relaxed about the closeness of the polling, claiming that past experience shows political instability leading to some short-term market uncertainty but has little lasting impact whether there is a change of government or not. </p> <p>In fact, since 1945, Australian and US shares have done slightly better under Democrat presidents in the US and Labour prime ministers in Australia than under the conservatives. </p> <p>The Australian dollar, which 12 months ago was languishing against sterling and the US dollar, is trading in its historic band of about 70 cents a dollar and is one of the most heavily traded as a haven currency. </p> <p>A Labour government would have little lasting impact on share prices, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP Capitol Investors, a division of the nation's largest life insurer. </p> <p>Individual sectors that could do well out of the campaign are construction and building if infrastructure spending is raised, life insurers and fund managers because of policies to boost national savings, energy stocks if the Kyoto agreement is ratified and banks if there is any change to the tax treatment of housing. </p> <p>According to opinion polls, the Howard government is regarded as better than Labour at handling national security and the economy. Bookmakers have the coalition winning but the ALP under Latham has narrowed the odds as attacks on Howard's credibility inflict political damage. </p> <p>After 13 years of growth, the economic fundamentals have weakened. Interest rates have risen, caused by insatiable consumer demand. Since Howard came to power, household debt has risen from about 85 per cent of disposable income to 140 per cent. </p> <p>The nation's love affair with property is also being tested as house prices fell for the first time after four years of double-digit growth. Both sides will attempt to exploit fears of rising interest rates in an electoral landscape that has changed as middle-class families move from the inner suburbs for a quiet life in the country - traditional conservative havens. </p> <p>The outcome could depend on whether it will be the 'battler' or 'Biffo' who delivers the killer blow.</p>",
  "There is something rather humiliating about the admiration gushing visibly from France's finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy towards Tom Cruise in the pictures released after a peculiar hour-long summit this week between the politician and film star. <p>Sarkozy is too awestruck to remember to look dignified and is smiling with embarrassing enthusiasm. No politician can look handsome when he is standing next to an A-list Hollywood actor, and the juxtaposition of the two men is unkind. Sarkozy even looks shorter than the famously tiny Cruise. </p> <p>But in the glamour-free world of French politics, Sarkozy is an action hero in his own right. Relentlessly energetic and constantly promoting his mission to save the nation, France's former 'premier flic' (top cop) clearly identifies with Cruise. His announcement on Wednesday that he will run for the leadership of France's ruling centre-right political party, the UMP, marks a crucial step in his unstoppable campaign to rise to the summit of French politics and seize the presidency from Jacques Chirac in 2007. He is certain to win the UMP leadership race, and with the party as his launchpad, Sarkozy, France's most popular politician, is in a powerful position to shape the post-Chirac era of French politics. </p> <p>Particularly gratifying for the finance minister was the President's decision to approve his candidacy, calling a temporary ceasefire to the feud between the elder statesman and his treacherous former protege which has animated French political life for years. Sarkozy's announcement was greeted by the President with friendly, but ultimately hollow, promises of support. </p> <p>Some analysts speculate that Chirac is gambling that his finance minister, who will have to give up his ministerial post once he begins the campaign, will drift into oblivion, swallowed up by the tedium of party electioneering. Chirac could then stand for a third presidential term in 2007 or manoeuvre his chosen successor into the post, thus preserving his political legacy. These are feeble hopes. Sarkozy has been planning his route to power for the past 25 years. Now he is gearing up for the final stages, which promise to be characterised by the hyperactive drive and unblushing ambition that have driven his career so far. </p> <p>BORN IN 1955 in Paris, Sarkozy's father was a Hungarian aristocrat who had come to France as a refugee. His mother worked as a lawyer. Their son plunged himself into politics at a precocious age, and was active in the Gaullist party's youth movement as a teenager. </p> <p>Chirac, then prime minister, spotted the young law student's talents at a conference in 1976 and invited him to Paris. Sarkozy swiftly made himself indispensable to the prime minister, who adopted him as a family friend and began grooming him for power. </p> <p>Their friendship was as powerful as their enmity has now become, and for a while it looked as if Chirac had found his successor. With Chirac's support a meteoric rise began, and in 1983, at 28, Sarkozy was elected France's youngest mayor, in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly. </p> <p>Two events destroyed his position as Chirac's spiritual son. The first, a little talked about extra-marital romance with the President's daughter Claude, which turned the first lady, Bernadette, resolutely against her husband's protege. The second was his decision in 1995 to support a rival right-wing presidential candidate, Edouard Balladur, against Chirac. </p> <p>For three years the men did not speak, but Chirac has subsequently been forced to tolerate Sarkozy, who is an irreplaceable electoral asset for the right. After a series of dismal results in regional and European polls earlier this year, and with the former UMP leader Alain Jupp\u00e9 convicted of corruption, the party needs him desperately. </p> <p>Where there was once affection, now there is scarcely disguised animosity and their simmering venom explodes periodically into bouts of spiteful backbiting. Chirac lets it be know that Sarkozy's 'insolence' exasperates him and has done his best to frustrate his ambitions, promoting the perennially unpopular, but much more biddable, Jean-Pierre Raffarin over him to prime minister in 2002. </p> <p>The thin coating of courtesy cracked spectacularly during the president's Bastille Day interview this year. On live television he lashed out with casual contempt: 'There is no disagreement with Mr Sarkozy for one simple reason. I decide; he carries out my orders.' </p> <p>But despite these attempts to squash him, Sarkozy's popularity ratings inch ever higher. 'The more they attack me, the more I advance,' he says. </p> <p>Sarkozy hits back in his own style. Colleagues have heard him berate those who disagree with him, muttering: 'You're as stupid as Chirac.' His message is simple: after 35 years at the summit of French politics, Chirac, 71, is past his sell by date. </p> <p>'In politics, you have to know when it is time to give up your place,' he said in a television interview. Asked whether he liked to fantasise about being president when he shaves every morning, he replied: 'Yes, and not only when I'm shaving.' </p> <p>His best response to the humiliation of the Bastille Day remarks was an eight-page Hello!- style interview given to Paris Match . Photographs showed Sarkozy, 49, jogging with his wife along a sandy beach, and playing football (in strangely inappropriate slip-on shoes) with his son. </p> <p>The effect was to remind readers that he is the younger, more energetic figure. His dynamism is a powerful tool at a time when political commentators are whispering that they think Chirac may be going deaf. </p> <p>Hyperactivity has become his trademark, causing tensions with some of his cabinet colleagues, put to shame by his unstoppable drive. His bizarre notion of what constitutes a summer holiday is to move with his family to a quiet seaside resort, invite key members of his political entourage to join him, hold daily press conferences and pose occasionally for photos, looking almost relaxed on a bicycle. The worst that rivals can say is: 'Sarkozy does too much. That's his achilles heel.' </p> <p>When he was appointed interior minister in 2002 he got over his disappoint ment at not getting the top job by racing around France, meeting firemen and police officers, tracking Corsican terrorists, comforting victims of national tragedy. Accompanied everywhere by a pack of journalists, his efforts were recorded nightly on the nation's news bulletins. </p> <p>Sarkozy has a populist touch. He does not come from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration - which traditionally trains France's senior public servants - and his language is consequentially more straightfoward than that of his rivals. </p> <p>An early piece of legislation for which he was responsible as interior minister banned flag-burning and booing during the Marseillaise. He is an accomplished networker. The fact that it was Cruise who requested this private meeting reflects this ability to spin a global web of contacts. </p> <p>His move to the finance ministry has denied him many of these photo opportunities. Jealous colleagues (of whom there are many) speculated this week that he would be grinding his teeth at having no role to play in the government's attempts to liberate the two French hostages from Iraq. Sarkozy thrives on crisis and as a young politician helped negotiate the release of school-children taken hostage in Neuilly. </p> <p>His centre-right politics are pragmatic. As interior minister he successfully seized ground from the National Front by talking tough on crime. He admires Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and would like to see France improve relations with Britain and America. He believes affirmative action is the way to help France's excluded minorities into the mainstream. </p> <p>He describes himself as a liberal reformer, believes in deregulation of the state, favours cutting taxes and wants to get rid of the 35 hour week. 'I don't care about ideology. I do what works,' he says. </p> <p>Sarkozy has more battles ahead before the 2007 elections. In the Elys\u00e9e palace, presidential aides talk of a policy known as TSS - tout sauf Sarkozy (anyone but Sarkozy) - and despite his professions of support, Chirac is thought to be preparing his new interior minister Dominque de Villepin for greater power. </p> <p>But the finance minister has developed a skin tough enough shield him against future attacks from his boss. 'I've made a lot of sacrifices since I went into politics. I've been wounded and I've got scars all over,' he says. 'But I don't feel resentment or bitterness. If you want to go far you have to ignore these setbacks.' </p> <p><b> Nicolas Sarkozy</b><br> </p> <p><b> DoB:</b> 28 January 1955 </p> <p><b> Job:</b> France's Finance Minister </p> <p><b> Education:</b> Law degree, Nanterre University, advanced degree in political science Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris </p> <p><b> Family:</b> Married to C\u00e9cilia Ciganer-Albeniz, three children</p>",
  "<p>The story that a band of wandering Trappist monks stepped into Calvin Klein's limestone and glass store on Madison Avenue one day, and were so taken with its elegantly minimal spaces that they immediately decided to track down its architect and hire him to design their monastery is a myth. In fact the order's abbot came across John Pawson's work in a book. </p> <p>But it is perfectly true that Pawson has designed a Cistercian monastery, and that it was consecrated last week. And it is also true that the monks asked Calvin Klein to design their robes. He agreed, but they changed their minds when they realised that it might not be a good idea to be quite so stylishly turned out and to attract quite so much publicity for it. </p> <p>Five years ago, Pawson found himself taking a delegation of Cistercians on a tour of his famously empty house in London, only for one of them to express his polite concern that it looked a little austere for a monastery. When the monks came to see him, they brought with them a list of requirements for the design of the monastery that is an engaging mixture of the practical and the spiritual. </p> <p>Pawson has translated them into Novy Dvur, the first monastery to be built in the Czech Republic for more than half a century. 'In those places where the monks stay for a long time on their knees, make sure that the floor is not in stone,' the abbot's brief asked. If there were any stained glass windows, 'there should be no colour, according to our tradition'. In the library, the brief asked for 'doors that don't slam, and a floor that mustn't creak'. </p> <p>In the dormitory, there should be 'a cubicle for each monk, closed by a curtain, with a special snorers' section 'for about a quarter of the total'. They take the form of white cubes. </p> <p>While the communists ruled Czechoslovakia, religion was officially discouraged. Churches were closed, monasteries dissolved, Catholic priests forced underground. There was no chance for any new monks to take their vows. After the end of communism, a handful of young men who believed that they had a religious calling were finally able to follow their vocation, travelling to France to be accepted as novitiates. When enough of them became full members of the Cistercian order, plans were made for them to start their own monastery in their homeland. It's only now, 15 years after the Velvet Revolution, that their plans have been realised. </p> <p>Once a Cistercian monk has taken his vows, the monastery becomes his entire world, and Pawson spent time in Novy Dvur's mother house in France at Sept-Fons to get as close to this very particular way of life as he could. </p> <p>I went with him on one visit. The food was good, served with wine and home-baked bread. You were welcome to join the services that are compulsory for the monks and take place throughout the day and night every four hours. It made me think of the constantly sleepless early days of parenthood. It's an experience that, whatever the extent of your own faith, quickly starts to have a profound effect on you. Your sense of time stops and somehow speeds up all at the same time. It clears your mind; ritual expands to fill every available synapse. </p> <p>Last Thursday I was in Novy Dvur to see the results of Pawson's research and to attend the consecration. It is perhaps the most unlikely place in the world to find the man who designed the store on Madison Avenue. But given that Pawson became famous for designing houses for the rich that look as austere as monasteries, there is a certain logic to the situation. Pawson, who has always wanted to live in the simplicity of a monk's cell, has finally had the chance to design a real one for himself. </p> <p>At the heart of the monastery is a modest old baroque manor house which forms the starting point for an extraordinary series of new buildings to sustain the community of 40 or so monks who will spend the rest of their lives here. There is a beautiful new church that manages to be both austere in its form and also a space with the quality of richness. The monks have a workshop in which they make mustard to raise funds to help support themselves. There is a small wood-fired generator, as well as the dormitory in which they sleep, and the refectory where they eat in silence. </p> <p>I watch as holy water is splashed vigorously on the white plaster walls of the monastery. The relics that will bestow sanctity on them have come all the way from Novy Dvur's Burgundian mother house in a golden ark protected by a purple cloth. Four monks, also dressed in purple, have hoisted it up on their shoulders on stout timber staves, and carried it carefully around the perimeter according to Cistercian ritual. You can hear the sound of chanting in the distance and the tolling of the occasional bell. The scent of pine trees floats across the wide Bohemian landscape mingling with a hint of incense. </p> <p>But Novy Dvur, impossibly remote though it is, still hasn't quite settled down to the Cistercian rule of silence and seclusion from the world. The Mass that the local bishop is conducting is being relayed on giant screens to a crowd several thousand strong in the surrounding fields. The courtyard in the cloister will never look like this again. It is full of people who, once the consecration is over, won't be allowed back by a closed order that discourages visitors and forbids women altogether. </p> <p>If elderly Czechs can still dimly remember what is expected of the pious, to judge by the celebrations at Novy Dvur, the younger generation is still trying to get the hang of it. A very young nun sprawls flirtatiously on the lawn in the cloister. She talks animat edly to a lolling, ponytailed figure with a beard whom I initially take to be a goth. When he rises to stand, he turns out to be a monk. And the ranks of the clergy are matched by rows of architects in their own priestly all-black uniforms, drawn by the chance to see the Pawson's largest work to date. </p> <p>The crowds are full of old men in berets, their faces like crags. There are stooped peasant women in floral print starched aprons. Soviet-era fashion still marks out their urban sisters, who sport ankle socks or rolled-down nylons. But there are also young men in black dusters and cowboy hats. Is it the deep-seated sense of gloom that comes so naturally to the Czechs that makes them such avid country and western fans? </p> <p>Pawson has designed the monastery to be a home. The monks' cells are sparse cubicles, with just a few hooks and open shelves for their possessions. But the monastery been freed from the distractions and petty nuisances of noise and cramped conditions that would make the monks' lives even more difficult. It's where they pray, where they contem plate their spiritual existence and look forward to the next world. The infirmary, where the younger monks care for those members of the community too frail to manage, has windows that overlook the cemetery. </p> <p>Pawson's architecture is a narrative of the life of the community, with the church altar hiding a cascade of steps that leads down to the cemetery. The Cistercians have always treated architecture as a reflection of their principles of simplicity and self denial. In the early days they produced buildings of sublime beauty, such as the Romanesque abbey of Le Thoronet in Provence which has always been one of Pawson's own inspirations. He has tried to bring a sense of that quality to Novy Dvur - 'something that is new, but true to the Cistercian essence', as he puts it. </p> <p>It's a conundrum that has exercised the Catholic establishment throughout the 20th century. Troubled that the church was losing ground because its art and architecture had started to look out of touch, Paul Valliant, an intellectual in the French church, was responsible for Matisse's chapel at St Paul de Vence and secured two major religious commissions for Le Corbusier. </p> <p>Pawson has worked in a very different context, but lives up to those ambitions. Like the Cistercians, he rejects ornamentalism. He looks for spiritual qualities in light and space. He has ranged his buildings in a rectangular cloister around a sloping garden courtyard; they integrate themselves with the restored manor house that forms one side of it, but transform its meaning. The cloister is all glass and provides views across the courtyard and, at the end of the long corridors, a glimpse of the landscape beyond. For Pawson, who has until now worked mostly at the scale of the domestic house, it is a profound and impressive demonstration of his abilities with a much larger scope. </p> <p>As the Mass comes to an end, the white-clad monks come out of the church to take Communion with the crowds. Snaking lines build up for the wafer and the blessing. There is a picnic after the Mass, with vats of goulash, trays of doughnuts, wine, sausages, beer and ice cream. I have never seen so many monks gathered together in one place. There are monks with bad haircuts, burly monks who haven't shaved, thin monks, trainee monks, more young monks than anyone has seen for a very long time, here to celebrate the consecration of their colleagues' monastery. </p> <p>There are monks from France, black monks (a few, anyway), monks with their hair cropped tight to their scalps, monks with eccentric tonsures wrapped around the edges of their heads in tufts. </p> <p>After the picnic a procession of them forms to wind their way around the monastery, past the neatly restored walls of the old manor house, down to the bottom of the hill, past the mustard factory and the cemetery. The artist Michael Craig-Martin, standing in the crowd to watch, feels his Benedictine schooldays come flooding back. Paul Smith is standing outside the church taking photographs. Inside, the white walls float like blades above the heads of the congregation. A gothic carved figure of the Virgin sits on a totem behind the altar. And the monks smile beatifically as they begin to chant.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the bell-ringing that welcomed Team GB's nine golds and 21 other medals in Athens there has been almost as much hand-wringing this past week from distressed critics who had spent the year - and more - before the Olympics warning what a disaster the 2004 Summer Games were going to be. </p> <p>From the construction work (unfinished stadiums) to transport (gridlock) to security (open house for terrorists) to the weather (too hot for the runners, too choppy for the sailors), the sporting extravaganza was going to be - yes, I'm afraid so - a Greek tragedy.</p> <p>Perhaps the absurdest stunt was that of a reporter from The Times who, several weeks before the Games, entered the main stadium with a photographer and filed a story of her having infiltrated a secure area. In fact, the Games' organisers had not at that point put in place the blanket security that worked so effectively. They had been aware of the reporter's presence all along and had asked her to leave. The paper still ran the story as a hair-raising expos\u00e9 of lax security. </p> <p>There seemed - subliminally, at least - to be a hint of national stereotyping or even a distinct whiff of racism about all the foreboding. How could a country littered with unfinished buildings sprouting rusty reinforcing rods manage to build the many and complicated venues required to stage an Olympic programme? Even if they did manage it, they would be far too dozy, given their propensity for falling asleep in the heat to run the Games. And all Frenchmen wear berets. Even if this undercurrent of doubting Greece's worthiness to be hosts did not exist, it is unlikely the Games would have escaped the scaremongering. In my experience of reporting on the Olympics - which goes back to 1968 and Mexico City - every staging is preceded by breathless reports of impending disaster. The realisation that this was really a non-story struck me in 1976 when, as the media correctly predicted, Montreal wasn't ready - and nobody noticed.</p> <p>Obviously, the 1972 Olympics was a security catastrophe and the world's press would have done mankind an almighty favour if it had uncovered the PLO's plans to attack the Israel delegation. It didn't and so the lazy journalistic practice has developed of, regardless, predicting something horrible will happen. If it does, the 'We Warned You' headlines will be gleefully sprung; if it doesn't, who cares, we got our scoop and that's all that matters. </p> <p>Given the timetable of Olympic bidding, preparing for a Games is always going to be a frantic beat-the-clock undertaking (except for super-efficient China in 2008). Say the International Olympic Committee next year awards London the 2012 Summer Games, which this paper hopes they do: you can bet being ready on time will be a close-run thing, and it will have very little to do with incompetence or absence of will. </p> <p>The Games get by - and Athens got by better than many, even with 11,099 athletes from 202 countries making it the largest sports event in history. Athenians rallied round with far greater enthusiasm than was widely predicted, with more people applying to serve as volunteers than ever before. </p> <p>Even ticket sales, the last refuge for those wishing fulfilment of their sinister forecasts, did not turn out too badly, with 3,581,080 tickets bought, which, taking into consideration Greece's population, was a per capita record. </p> <p>Television was a triumph, too. If the world switched on to watch the 2000 Games in Sydney, they did so with even greater enthusiasm this time, with the audience put at four billion, a 20 per cent larger share of viewers. </p> <p>So why do the smartarses at Observer Sport feel in a position to point out all this now? Why didn't we say beforehand that Athens would be ready on time and all would be well? We did, we did, we modestly cry. In August last year, we advised that you should disregard all the grim predictions . It was very pleasing to see The Times' publish an apologia to the organisers last Tuesday for all the nasty things written in advance about Athens, but, breathtakingly, they did so on behalf of 'the world's media, which has let you down'. </p> <p>Speak for yourselves. And, more important, think before you do it again.</p>",
  "<p>Ask anyone what they think of Kieren Fallon and you will get one of two answers. Either he is the best jockey this country has ever seen, the punter's pal, the man who can get more out of a horse than anyone else in the weighing room, or he is the most crooked man ever to fling his leg over a saddle, involved in every betting scam going, controlled by the Triads, fatally flawed in nature and corrupt in the practice of his profession. </p> <p>Neither extreme is true, nor is it fair to Fallon and the art of riding racehorses. He is a maverick, a wilful individual with a temper and a strong tendency to get involved with the 'wrong' people. He has been treated for alcohol problems, is a reluctant communicator and has an uncanny knack of landing himself in trouble. He is also an inspired jockey.</p> <p>Fallon is not the best there has ever been and, with his unconventional long-rein style, he is not the most stylish, but he has regularly shown that he can motivate a horse to do more than it thinks it is capable of. He is quiet in his manner, but, when he elaborates, shows fascinating insight about what makes a horse try harder and the tactics of riding a race. He gives the game more thought than one would expect, is ice-cool under pressure and can out-psyche his rivals with the odd, sparingly worded comment.</p> <p>Fallon has been champion jockey for six of the past seven years, has won the Derby three times in the last six runnings and has a healthy lead in this season's championship. Along with Frankie Dettori, he is the biggest name in racing.</p> <p>Yet Dettori's fame is based upon positive images - the man who pulled off the 'magnificent seven', the affable team captain on A Question of Sport, the good-looking Italian who poses with his beautiful wife and ever-expanding family, who can model clothes and sell pizzas. If Frankie is the happy, smiley, wholesome image of a jockey, Fallon is the flipside of the coin. Take him off a horse and he is a walking liability.</p> <p>There are those in racing who expressed surprise that Fallon was among those arrested during the dawn raids of last Wednesday. The sad truth is that, for most people, it was no shock at all. Wherever there is controversy, to the public it seems that Fallon is not far behind. He complained of being treated 'like a terrorist' during his 14 hours in detention, four hours of which were spent being questioned. 'They made sure I felt like a criminal,' he said.</p> <p>Then he turns up at Salisbury, scurrying through the back door of the weighing room with a shaven-headed, burly minder by his side. Sky News replayed the pictures of Fallon arriving at the airport after the News of the World sting six months ago. Wearing a black leather jacket and dark glasses, he ducked under the rail, pushing photographers to one side and bolted so fast that his minder could barely keep up. He was hardly painting a picture of the wronged innocent.</p> <p> So the man needs an image counsellor, but is he a criminal? Fallon has accused the Jockey Club of 'victimisation' and if the case built against him is not rock solid, with concrete proof that he has deliberately altered the outcome of races for financial gain, he has every right to that view. If the Jockey Club and the City of London police have got it right and Fallon is one of those linked to those who have profited from the equivalent of insider trading, he will be charged with conspiracy to defraud. If the charges are proven, champion jockey or not, the punishment must be so severe that no jockey or trainer would ever countenance the idea of preventing a horse from running to the best of its ability.</p> <p>The culture of racing needs to change. The Jockey Club will have to adopt the philosophy of Jacques Rogge, who declared that every positive dope test at the Olympic Games was a triumph for sport, in believing that every offender caught is a victory for racing.</p> <p>Britain has the most interesting and competitive horse racing in the world, but there is a tacit acceptance that all is not transparent, nor entirely innocent. There is a tradition that needs to be challenged, of playing a game, of being 'clever' with a horse. It is why leading trainer Mark Johnston chose the logo 'Always Trying' in the wry recognition that not everyone else is. Training racehorses is not an exact science: they do not run the same way every time, some take longer to get fit than others, it takes a while to work out how some should be ridden.</p> <p>Consequently, mistakes will always be made and there will be unpredictable elements, but the intention must remain consistently honest.</p> <p>Dawn raids and high-profile arrests seem an extreme reaction, but if that is what it takes to prevent the sport from self-destructing, it is a price worth paying. To my mind, all-weather racing must shoulder part of the blame. Low-class races that exist purely as betting fodder take the meaning out of the game and as soon as it ceases to mean anything, what is the point?</p> <p>A jockey would not stop a horse in the Derby, or at Royal Ascot or over jumps at the Cheltenham Festival because it means so much to win there. The vast majority of jockeys would not stop a horse anywhere for any price - their daily existence depends upon their ability to make a horse win - but there are a few whom temptation may have led astray and it is not difficult to work out why. When racing exists predominantly as a means of striking a bet, can its purity be guaranteed?</p> <p>The battle facing the Jockey Club and the City of London police is to catch and punish those who are guilty (no easy task) and to persuade the rest of racing that this is no longer a case of playing a clever game.</p> <p>Racing will never be predictable - it would be dull if that were the case - but, to be trusted, it must be trustworthy, both to the public and those in it.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

But it hasn't generally been a good setting for movies, with nothing between Anna Neagle in Nell Gwyn (1934) and the screen version of Rose Tremain's Restoration (1995) to match the power of Howard Barker's 1983 play, Victory, a powerful political study of the period. </p> <p>One would have liked to see Richard Eyre make a movie of Victory that had a similar political bite to his first and best feature film, the anti-Thatcher state-of-the-nation piece, The Ploughman's Lunch. Sadly, he's chosen to direct <strong> Stage Beauty</strong>, adapted by American author Jeffrey Hatcher from his own play, which by the author's own admission attempted to do for the theatre of Charles II's time what Shakespeare in Love did for the Elizabethan stage. </p> <p>Most of the characters are based on real people. Billy Crudup plays bisexual actor Ned Kynaston, famous for playing female roles in the company run by Thomas Betterton (Tom Wilkinson), generally regarded as the greatest actor of his day. While Ned is the toast of London as Desdemona, his dresser Maria (Claire Danes) is breaking laws and conventions through clandestine appearances in the same role. </p> <p>Then Ned affronts influential folk at court, especially Nell Gwyn, who's played by Zo\u00eb Tapper the way Barbara Windsor would perform in Carry On Restoring . So she gives Charles (a camp Rupert Everett) an especially sumptuous blow job to persuade him to ban men from playing women's roles. This sends Ned's career into free fall and in the manner of A Star Is Born or All About Eve, the dresser takes over and becomes a great actress. </p> <p>Up to this point, the mode is comic, if never particularly amusing, dealing in anachronism with the subtlety of The Flintstones . Then the film starts to get serious, not to say solemn, as Ned and Maria get up close and personal, talking about gender, sexual identity and the art of acting. It's Tootsie with a periwig and without the jokes. He coaches her as Desdemona and within 48 hours they're ready to shock London with a natu ralistic performance of Othello that anticipates the RSC and National Theatre of the latter part of the 20th century and makes Donald Wolfit resemble David Garrick. </p> <p>Heavy handed and adolescently bawdy, it's more like something run up by drama students as part of a graduation show than a serious comedy about changing theatrical styles like Pinero's Trelawny of the 'Wells'. </p> <p>For 80-odd years, westerns have been reinterpreting for successive generations the stories of Davy Crockett and the Alamo, Custer and the Little Big Horn, Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County war, Jesse James and the Northfield bank raid, Wild Bill Hickok and Deadwood, Wyatt Earp and Tombstone. All but one have been glorified and vilified in a way that reflects the temper of changing times. The exception is Crockett and the Alamo, where 250 Texans perished in 1836 defying General Santa Ana's 4,000-strong Mexican army. The place is more than a tourist attraction, it's a shrine, and the battle cry 'Remember the Alamo' has echoed down the years at moments of national crisis. </p> <p>John Wayne's epic treatment of the subject, with himself as a massively heroic Crockett, was a strident right-wing intervention in the Cold War back in 1960, relishing the word 'republic' and saying 'Better Tex than Mex' but meaning 'Better Red than Dead'. Though clearly a post-9/11 movie, John Lee Hancock's <strong> The Alamo</strong> is more ambiguous than revisionist and steers a wary line between triumphalism and iconoclasm. </p> <p>In the roles played by Wayne, Richard Widmark, Lawrence Harvey and Richard Boone, the new film has low-key, unheroic actors - Billy Bob Thornton (Crockett), Jason Patric (Jim Bowie), Patrick Wilson (garrison commander William Travis) and Dennis Quaid (General Sam Houston, first President of Texas). </p> <p>They are not men self-evidently keeping a rendezvous with destiny. Crockett, having lost his seat in the Senate, has come to Texas to get a patch of ground. He isn't expecting to fight and only stays because he's a prisoner of his own myth. Bowie is dying of consumption and is at the Alamo to reclaim its artillery for Houston. The politically ambitious Travis unexpectedly finds himself in command and has difficulty asserting his authority. </p> <p>But they rise to the occasion and both the siege of the Alamo and the battle of San Jacinto, in which the Mexicans were routed the following year, are handled in a grave fashion, as if the makers were afraid of appearing to be glorifying war. </p> <p>Few bones are made about the commercial, expansionist aims of the Texan leaders and while bickering goes on at the Alamo, an observer on the fringe, speaking in Spanish, describes the future martyrs as 'lowlifes' and opines: 'Santa Ana only wants to rule Mexico; these people want to rule the whole world.' But Santa Ana is presented, not inaccurately, as a military leader of great arrogance and a preening monster, with contempt for the lives of his men whom he employs like suicide bombers. </p> <p>The film's thrust is that this is a war that should not have been fought, but having engaged with a monstrous enemy, it must be carried on, however reluctantly. This is the way it reflects the times and it's a decent, rather half-hearted liberal affair designed to appeal neither to hawks nor doves. </p> <p>Adapted from a comic book and directed by the talented Mexican horror-movie specialist Guillermo del Toro, <strong> Hellboy</strong> is a tolerable mixture of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Alien and Men in Black. The spawn of the devil surfaces through the jaws of hell, is adopted by the British head of the American government's secret Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (John Hurt), and helps save the world from a reincarnated Rasputin. There's much violence, some humour, relatively little gore. </p> <p><strong> Festival Express </strong> is a brief, bright documentary using old and new footage, tracing a journey by private train from Toronto to Vancouver that a group of rock musicians made in 1970, jamming together and giving concerts along the way. The performers, including Janis Joplin (who died that year) and the Grateful Dead, come out of it well. Their audiences, who demand free entertainment as their right, don't. </p> <p>In Ferzan Ozpetek's likeable <strong> Facing Window</strong>, a working-class couple take in an elderly, middle-class amnesiac (one-time heart-throb Massimo Girotti) they meet walking the streets of Rome and find themselves involved in a twisting story that leads back to a Nazi pogrom in the Second World War. As with the same director's other pictures, bourgeois marriage is brought into question and homosexuality viewed in a warmly sentimental light. </p> <p>Very briefly. <strong> You're My Hero</strong> deals touchingly with teenage life in Seville following the death of Franco in 1975. <strong> In Casablanca Angels Don't Fly</strong>, the feature debut of a Moroccan director trained in Italy, is the predictable but none the less moving story of three Berbers from impoverished mountain villages seeing their dreams turn to dust while trying to earn a living in the big city. </p> <p>Set in a dreary Austrian town, <strong> Free Radicals</strong> is a well-made ensemble piece along the lines of Altman's Short Cuts and Anderson's Magnolia , in which the paths of numerous people cross over the course of a year. We and they wonder whether we live in a world of order or chaos, or perhaps a combination of both. </p> <p><strong> The Perfect Husband</strong> is a Bombay movie in English about the problems various rich upper-class families in Chandigarh experience in marrying off their children. One of the worst Indian films I've ever seen, it ends with the dedication 'To the daughters and daughters-in-law of India'. They deserve better. </p> <p><strong>Top five films</strong></p> <p><strong> The Motorcycle Diaries</strong> (15) The young Che Guevara on the road to iconic fame </p> <p><strong>Fahrenheit 9/11 </strong> (15) See why Michael Moore took a bow when they booed him at the Republican Party Convention </p> <p><strong> Dodgeball </strong> (12A) Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn in the year's most side-splitting comedy </p> <p><strong> My Architect</strong> (PG) Great documentary about maverick architect Louis Kahn by his son </p> <p><strong> Fear and Trembling</strong> (12A) Belgian girl in business in Tokyo</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Terminal</strong> <br>(125 mins, 12A) <br>Directed by Steven Spielberg; starring Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci</p> <p>A few years ago Richard E Grant appeared in Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life, a brilliant comedy short that merged Capra and Kafka. Steven Spielberg's new film, The Terminal, which is intermittently funny and very long, might well have been called Frank Capra's The Trial. Tom Hanks, America's likeable Mr Everyman, becomes the acceptable face of the alien 'other', Viktor Navorski, a sad citizen of the fictional eastern European state of Krakhozia. When a war breaks out back home while he's in transit, Viktor has his return ticket and passport impounded and becomes trapped in the international travel lounge of New York's Kennedy airport because he can't be given a visa to enter the States and is unable to return. </p> <p>It's a familiar subject, touched on with some seriousness in, for example, Casablanca and in Mitchell Leisen's Hold Back the Dawn (co-scripted by Billy Wilder) where Charles Boyer was a would-be immigrant stuck in a Mexican border town before the Second World War. Some years ago the role of Viktor would have gone to Peter Sellers or Peter Ustinov. It is important (and a canny decision by Spielberg) in these troubled times that the part is played by someone as sympathetic as Hanks, a gifted comedian who can manage guile but hasn't a streak of nastiness in him. </p> <p>From the start, Viktor plays a game of bureaucratic cat-and-mouse with the sad by-the-book Customs and Border Protection official, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci, in customarily excellent unsympathetic form), who's hoping after 17 years' dedicated service to become overall boss of airport security. Dixon treats Viktor with icy contempt as a temporary problem to be left in the lounge for a day or so with a few meal vouchers. When he appears to turn into a permanent resident, Dixon tries first to pass him over to other departments, then to facilitate his escape. But after sad blunderings, and always remaining appealingly vul nerable, Viktor starts to control his sorry situation. He sets up house in a disused wing of the airport, starts learning English and makes a few cents collecting unreturned luggage trolleys. When Dixon frustrates this source of income, he drifts into casual work with builders where his skills as an artisan bring him more an hour than Dixon himself earns. Eventually he can afford a Hugo Boss suit (part of the film's relentless product placement) in which to court a beautiful air hostess (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose confidence in human goodness he's helping to restore. </p> <p>A good deal of this is ingenious and funny. But the movie is heading steadily into Capraesque sentimentality as Viktor becomes the close friend of an elderly Indian cleaner, a Hispanic kitchen worker (for whom he acts as Cupid with a customs clerk) and a black baggage attendant. Climactically he becomes the hero of not only the exploited, multi-ethnic employees of the terminal shops, but also of the immigration staff (Dixon excepted of course). It also turns out that Viktor had not come to the States for social or economic advantage but to honour his late father by executing a symbolic act of filial piety that can be seen as highly flattering to American culture. </p> <p>Those who loathe everything about airport terminals (the mirrored surfaces, the neon lighting, the muzak, the hideous acoustics, the perpetual queues, the lifeless throngs, the announcements, the exclusivity of private lounges) will find this movie oppressive in the way the makers probably intended. The brilliant set, the work of production designer Alex McDowell, is like a flashy annexe of hell, and the film's length gives Viktor's plight a sense of eternity, or at least of time suspended. The compassion, however, is, if not exactly false, too thin to bear the crushing weight of the sentimentality.</p>",

  "<b>Why should IHT rob me of my inheritance?</b> <p>Patrick Collinson's sweeping assertion that it's only the \"idle rich\" who are affected by IHT is wrong. </p> <p>My 84-year-old mother lives in a \"posh\" part of London, but it was much poorer when she moved there in 1951.

When I decided to be a self payer I took the steps you recommend, and reserved the money I would have paid to the insurance schemes into a separate private account. </p> <p>I have recently had, at the age of 60, a radical circumcision by a specialist surgeon in an NHS clinic. The cost was \u00a3400: \u00a3100 for the consultation, and \u00a3300 for the operation. If I add on the taxi fare of \u00a360 to take me home across London then the total bill was \u00a3460, rather different to the \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,600 quote by Bupa in your article. </p> <p>It is now quite easy to choose your own treatment from the web.

The result was a first rate operation which justified my not very extensive research. </p> <p>As I am developing cataracts, I have already started to identify hospitals and clinics where treatment can best be undertaken. Once again the cost will be substantially less than the \u00a31,900 to \u00a32,900 quoted in the Bupa tables. </p> <p>The main advantage of being a self payer is not financial; it is in doing one's own research, being involved in one's own treatment, and being able to monitor the results <br><b>John Green<br></b>Epsom, Surrey </p> <p><b> Why I'm flying into a rage </b></p> <p>I now know why the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet will win - they are flexible and accommodate client needs, in contrast to the established airlines, like Austrian Airlines, who seem unaware of the fact that there is competition. </p> <p>I made an internet booking on the Austrian Airlines site on February 18 for travel to Vienna on October 15.

  "It is Thursday night and the young of Tel Aviv are queuing for their supplies for the big night out of the Jewish week. <p>At the city-centre kiosks, some customers ask for cigarettes or some gum, but about one in three furtively inquires: \"Hagigat?\" </p> <p>The shopkeeper looks straight ahead. His hand moves below the counter and he pulls out a small white capsule, which he exchanges discreetly for 50 shekels (\u00a36.50). </p> <p>Hagigat is the latest in a line of legal drugs which add spice to Tel Aviv's already potent night life. </p> <p>It means \"party\" in Hebrew and is derived from khat, a plant chewed in Somalia and Yemen for its amphetamine effect. Other legal drugs include \"liquid energy\", a test tube of viscous plant extracts, and amyl nitrate or poppers. </p> <p>As Tuesday's suicide bomb attack in Beersheba demonstrated, the conflict continues; Palestinian frustration is boiling less than a 20-minute drive from Tel Aviv. Yet the party goes on, driven by a desire to escape the grim realities of Israeli life. </p> <p>In the past four years of the intifada, Tel Aviv's nightlife has gone from strength to strength. Larger and better bars, and clubs that would put London, New York and Paris to shame, open and close regularly to satisfy fickle tastes. </p> <p>The only major upset was the killing of 21 young people in June 2001 as they queued for the Dolphinarium nightclub on the city seafront. </p> <p>\"It was only when there was the bombing at the Dolphinarium that it hit people,\" said Amir Bar Yitzhak, the editor of the Leyla nightlife website. </p> <p>\"That was right at the centre of nightlife. That started a decline in people going out, but they got used to it. Then people decided they were going to go out in spite of everything and party until they fell down. That has levelled out a bit now and things are more normal.\" </p> <p>Legal drugs have become a major part of the hedonism. Hagigat is described on the packaging as \"an aphrodisiac of organic material. 100% natural without chemicals\". </p> <p>\"Drink after food and take with a lot of water. Sell only to those over 18,\" it advises. </p> <p>Ronen Hazut, the owner of a city-centre kiosk, said: \"Hagigat sells fast. People take this pill and say it's amazing. It's our biggest money maker and that's why we sell it.\" </p> <p>Moshe Haimkevitch, his partner who has taken the drug, said: \"You feel high, but you're still alert and know what you're doing. You have power and energy, and most important, it makes you incredibly horny,\" he told the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. </p> <p>Another popular product is Liquid Energy, sold at a similar price. \"This is drunk mainly during parties, and has to be shaken well. It has good effects and gives energy,\" said Mr Haimkevitch. </p> <p>In the past year several new venues have opened, described as \"pick-up\" bars. They feature large serving areas surrounded by scores of bar stools to ensure that everyone is visible to members of the opposite sex. </p> <p>David Tur opened Tel Aviv's largest bar, Lansky, last year. It cost more than a \u00a31m to fit out and features 100 bar stools around the longest bar in the Middle East, if not Europe. </p> <p>\"People come here because they want to see people. The customers here are mostly single or cheaters,\" he said. \"This place is labelled a pick-up bar. I don't know what that means. There is a lot of interaction between people who don't know each other. If that makes it a pick-up bar, then it is.\" </p> <p>Mr Tur, who worked in London for several years, said the nightlife experience in Tel Aviv was totally different. </p> <p>\"The interaction is very different here compared to London. Here you can see everybody, you are sitting next to everybody. It's not like you are going to a bar with your friends, you are sharing the experience with everyone,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Bar Yitzhak added: \"The atmosphere is warm, open and welcoming. Everything is straightforward. There is rarely any violence and you don't see any obvious drunkenness. You can always make friends; there is always someone to talk to.\" </p> <p>When drawn on the subject, most Tel Aviv residents favour compromise to achieve peace with the Palestinians. But on the whole they try to block out the military regime and the oppression of Palestinians. </p> <p>\"I can appreciate it isn't much fun living in a refugee camp, or in the West Bank,\" Mr Bar Yitzhak said. \"But I think it is hard for people elsewhere to imagine what it is like for someone to come to your favourite bar or cafe and blow themselves up. </p> <p>\"We are in the middle of the barrel of a gun, yet everything is still so alive.\" </p> <p><b>A resident of Israel, originally from the UK, describes taking hagigat:</b> </p> <p>I discreetly slip the capsule into my mouth and wash it down with Czech beer. Around the bar, I can see groups of men and women talking animatedly and some are dancing. </p> <p>Typical Brit, I won't dance or initiate conversation. </p> <p>\"Where you are from?\" pipes up one of my female neighbours.\"So you like Israel?\" she continues. </p> <p>Rather than retreat into my shell, I smile broadly and start to chat. I feel a tingly sensation and a sense of confidence. I've had just one small glass of beer: this could only be the hagigat. </p> <p>The music is now flowing through my body. I look around the bar indulgently. This is a great night. </p> <p>Now I feel more than warm, almost sensuous.I need to stroke something, anything. The feeling remains with me for the next couple of hours. </p> <p>Eventually I feel a sense of anxiety and the warmth decreases. I feel impatient and I need another drink or maybe just another hagigat.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Full time: Austria 2 England 2</strong> More fuel to the anti-Sven fire: England really blew that. Thanks for all your emails, I'm off for a soothing shandy. Rob.</p> <p><strong>92 min</strong> That should be it, I'd have thought. The last 20 minutes have been recklessly end to end, but it looks like an honourable - and, from England's point of view, entirely unnecessary - draw.</p> <p><strong>91 min</strong> Joe Cole gets in on the right, but his cross is blocked with Owen waiting to pounce six yards out.</p> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Three added minutes. England have a corner.</p> <p><strong>88 min</strong> Defoe spanks a 20-yarder <em>that</em> far wide - off the outside of the post, in fact - but he might have rolled in Frank Lampard, who would have had a clear one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Routine straight, long balls are causing England trouble now. How can such control having given way to this?</p> <p><strong>85 min</strong> It's all too easy to criticise David James, so I'm going to. That really was a preposterous howler; as a result, England are as vulnerable as Ally McBeal, when they should be cruising.</p> <p><strong>83 min</strong> And now here comes the Messiah. Walter Mitty (aka Joe Cole) is coming on for Bridge as Kollman wastes a decent chance. Clipped ball in and, having lost his man, Kollman tried an acrobatic volley (which he fresh-aired) when he should have chested it down.</p> <p><strong>82 min</strong> Relax - Jamie Carragher's coming on. For Gerrard. \"This game has livened up so you ca spill the beans another time - will you name names?\" says Mark Judd. Absolutely. \"It appeared Mr Glendenning made reference to you in the 'Rumour Mill'.\" Yes, he's always been one for self-publicity.</p> <p><strong>81 min</strong> This game is spread further than a suspect up against a wall in TJ Hooker. A goal could come at either end now. </p> <p><strong>77 min</strong> Beckham is booked for a late challenge. Not like him to spit the dummy when things don't go his way.</p> <p><strong>76 min</strong> Another half-chance for Austria, as a one-two allows Kollman to locate orbit from just outside the box. England are as all over the place as a Hoxton haircut. \"Did Glenn Hoddle really describe Frank Lampard's shove (that gave away the free-kick for first goal) as a \"municipal touch\"?\" wonders Tim Smillie. I think he might have done, you know...</p> <p><strong>74 min</strong> It's been a remarkable turnaround. England were as comfortable as could be, then one cherry pie-fine goal and one Andrex-soft one and all of a sudden they're desperately seeking a winner. Defoe on for Smith, who has had a quiet game and should have scored at 1-0.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Austria 2 England 2</strong> A shocker from David James! Ivanschitz belted one from long range, which got a slight deflection and fizzed along and right under James, who went down slower than a chap on the dancefloor after 12 pints. Welcome back, Calamity</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Austria 1 England 2</strong> Game over? Maybe not. Lampard concedes a soft free-kick on the edge of the area, and the substitute Kollman bends a beautiful left-footer into the corner. As the Lord Hod shrewdly spotted, none of the England wall jumped. Had they done so, one of them would have worn it in the snout. But it'd still be 2-0.</p> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Ivanschitz whips a dangerous cross over, but Ledley King clears immaculately. He's quite a find for England, even if he is fifth-choice centre-half. \"If the game is rubbish perhaps you could tell us about your speed-dating experience,\" says Mark Judd. \"You never know a female reader may take pity on you.\" What makes you think it was me, eh?</p> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Gerrard slashes a volley from range over the top. He's been the man of the match tonight, and it's just a shame that - by his kite-high standards - he was so muted in Portugal. Here's Dennis Warren: \"The funny thing about the Talksport webcast is that they do keep saying that it's unofficial coverage as Gavin Hollis says, but also that they are watching on the telly (albeit in Vienna), and that the crowd sounds we hear are coming from their studio, and not from the real game -canned cheering.\" Don't forget the Alvin Martin factor, either.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Austria 0 England 2</strong> Magnificent goal from Steven Gerrard! Owen laid a short ball to him 25 yards out, and he whipped across it to send an absolute screamer into the far corner. It dipped and curved majestically. Not dissimilar to Beckham's goal in La Coruna two years ago, and another stormer for Gerrard in Austria after two for Liverpool the other week. And game over, too.</p> <p><strong>64 min</strong> \"To answer Lee Matthews' question about SWP - he's more like Lawrence Booth than Barry Glendenning,\" says Matthew Cobb. \"Younger, slimmer and less cynical! And Larry's a City supporter.\" That he is. But it's <em>Lawro</em> in GU Towers. Or The Machine. Or I, Boothy.</p> <p><strong>62 min</strong> England are a lot more ragged now, but these things are relative: Austria are a poor side, and they'd struggle to take advantage of a drunk, lonely minute-by-minute reporter, let alone a slightly nervy England defence.</p> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Ridiculous antics from David James. Long, straight ball from the back, and as Haas marched on to it 35 yards out, James appeared from nowhere and was rounded as easily as a statue in a training drill. Thankfully John Terry got back to clear off the line: Haas's effort from near the touchline was just sneaking in at the near post.</p> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Like Stifler, Ashley Cole takes one for the team. A whack, in this case. But he's OK.</p> <p><strong>54 min</strong> ...which ends with Kuhbauer drilling one from 25 yards which the ever-reliable David James lets through his hands and manages to save only between his legs. Good spell for Austria, this.</p> <p><strong>53 min</strong> Corner to Austria...</p> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Outstanding save from Manninger. Some dreadful defending left Smith eight yards out, with the goal at his mercy. He picked his spot and Manninger, flinging himself to the left like a turncoat politician, made an outstanding reaction save. Shades of the 1997/98 title run-in. But Smith should have scored. \"Isn't it Keith Moon on the right?\" chuckles Andrew Nichols, ruining a beautiful moment by adding one of these :-)</p> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Low shot from Owen, on the corner of the box, dribbles along for Manninger to make a comfortable save.</p> <p><strong>48 min</strong> One of those trademark pre-emptive dives from Beckham earns Pogatetz a yellow card. Actually on reflection that wasn't a nice tackle. \"Did you catch the pre-match 'Barbarella' show as described on Five Live?\" says Mark Judd. \"It didn't manage to shut Alan Green up though.\" Afraid not, but it sounds at least 400 times more entertaining than the main fare.</p> <p><strong>46 min</strong> They're back on.</p> <p><strong>More chatter</strong> \"Alvin Martin for England manager,\" says a straight-faced Gavin Hollis. \"I'm listening to the game on Talksport.com. The commentators (Alvin Martin) keep going on about how this is \"unofficial coverage\" - does this mean they are likely to be arrested at some point for illegal football banter? And does anybody know why the game isn't on the Beeb?\"</p> <p><strong>SWP</strong> \"I live in Madrid and have never actually seen Shaun Wright-Phillips play,\" says Lee Matthews. \"What kind of a player is he? Who would you compare him to?\" Hmm, tricky. He's got the lot: chief qualities are extreme pace and seriously tricky feet, plus he works back as hard as any winger since Giggs in the mid-90s. He can pass, shoot from range, and he's just maturing into a top-class player. As for a comparison, I really don't know. Like GU's Barry Glendenning, he defies comparison. </p> <p><strong>Anti-3-5-2 rant from Brooks Davis</strong> \"So, Rob, the 4-4-2 is part of the English cultural identity.\" So is the punch-up; it doesn't make it right. \"Why doesn't Eriksson just get Alan Thompson of Celtic for the left wing? He plays there consistently and well.\" Alan Thompson?!</p> <p><strong>Half-time chit-chat</strong> \"Is the Bridge and Cole partnership on the left going well?\" asks Richard Tucker. No. The plus is that there has been no attacking threat at all from Austria down that side. (Or the middle, or their left.) But Bridge, when he gets the ball, is always stuck, and veering infield. He looks what he is: a player out of position. Now if we were playing 3-5-2...</p> <p><strong>Half time</strong> Well it was as dull as we feared, but England have done a pretty efficient job, and lead deservedly through a very, very clever goal from Frank Lampard. Who says all English footballers are brainless dunces, eh?</p> <p><strong>42 min</strong> Martin Tyler can't stop talking about Alex Manninger's career. You'd almost think he was an Arsenal fan, eh? \"It's Chris De Burgh on the right, not Baker,\" says Tim Smillie. \"You melon.\"</p> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Trademark Owen run in behind to a long pass from Gerrard (I think, if only 'cause it's always him who plays such passes), and Manninger - at least a yard outside the box - made an orthodox save...and the referee's assistant waved played on. That would and should have been a red card.</p> <p><strong>38 min</strong> Sam Herbert has just pointed out that the mighty Greece are 2-0 down ... to Albania. There's a moral in that, and here it is: IF YOU WEREN'T SO NEGATIVE SVEN WE'D BE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS AS WE'D HAVE BEATEN THE DUTCH WHO WERE RUBBISH AND AS FOR GREECE WELL LOOK.</p> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Little bit of pressure from Austria, but they showed all the punch of a pacifist with two broken hands. \"Why the hell is there no highlights of this game on terrestrial television?!\" thunders Jonny May. \"If there was I wouldn't have to bother with this sort of thing, it's a fine state of affairs etc.\" Unattractive an option as it is on a balmy late-summer Saturday night, you could always go to the pub.</p> <p><strong>35 min</strong> So what's happening here is what we should have seen in the summer: England are 1-0 up, and bossing possession and the game completely. Shame they (or more likely Sven) doesn't have the courage to do it against half-decent teams, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Like Bjork said, it's all gone quiet. \"Has Hod said anything ridiculous yet?\" says Ian Bruff. Annoyingly, no, apart from his perpetual misuse of 'them'. To be fair to Hod, I think he's an outstanding coach, and even now you can see he reads the game superbly. Shame he couldn't man-manage a pot plant, eh?</p> <p> <strong>28 min</strong> That's knocked the stuffing right out of Austria, who are still bleating about the free-kick. \"Is it just me or is that Danny Baker in the picture with Ethan Hawke and Judy Delpy and not Richard Linklater?\" says someone who didn't bother revealing their name. It's just you. And it's Julie.</p> <p><strong>26 min</strong> \"You are a hell of a lot more entertaining and make a lot more sense than Graham Taylor on Five Live anyway,\" says Simon Rose. \"So cheers!\" Sob. I think that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Austria 0 England 1</strong> Superb goal from Frank Lampard. Beckham lined up the blast, Austria charged en masse, and Beckham simply tapped it diagonally to his left for Lampard to score from, ooh, two yards out. Clever stuff.</p> <p><strong>23 min</strong> That was weird: Neville fizzed one low across the face, the defender knocked it square six yards out and then stopped, and Manninger dived on it with Owen about to pounce. Then the defender claimed he heard a whistle. Which, in hindsight, he did - though not from the referee. And it probably wasn't a backpass either. Let's hope they don't pay for it, eh?</p> <p>b&gt;22 min Handled backpass gives England a free-kick six yards out. \"You are not alone,\" says Georg Oppitz, doing his best Embrace impression. \"I am an Austrian who is sitting in Canada and is supporting England. Actually I think most of the Austrian football supporters hope that England wins (preferably by a high margin) - otherwise Krankl doesn't get the sack.\" So what's he done wrong, then, apart from inadvertently evoke memories of Jimmy Krankie? </p> <p> <strong>19 min</strong> England are starting to boss possession now, with Austria settling snugly into a revolutionary 8-0-2 formation. Meanwhile, Italy are 1-0 down at home to Norway. Hahahahahahahahahahaha, and so on.</p> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Like a minute-by-minute reporter striving for a decent analogy and singularly failing, England haven't really got going yet. Then, from nowhere, Lampard clips a cross from deep and Owen, straining his neck muscles, loops a header on to the top of the net from the edgge of the box. Very good effort.</p> <p><strong>15 min</strong> Bizarrely, there are Peter Werth advertising hoardings all round the ground, bizarrely. I used to have these lovely silky Peter Werth trousers, only for fashion to render them redundant. I was as gutted as Drew Barrymore after about eight minutes of Scream.</p> <p><strong>13 min</strong> First move of quality from England. Diagonal, sliderule pass from Gerrard of the very highest order and Owen, under pressure from behind, sliced his shot.</p> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Free-kick to England on the left. Like an angry drunk on Rochester High Street, Beckham hits the first man.</p> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Since you ask, I don't like Bridge on the left of midfield. If it has to be either it should be Cole, a fleet-footed, clincal and clean attacking threat. What it should really be, of course, is 3-5-2, with Cole and either Neville or Wright-Phillips, depending on the ability of the opposing left-winger. But as that's about as likely to happen as Girls Aloud being minute-by-minute devotees, I shall change the subject.</p> <p><strong>6 min</strong> First sign of danger as Kuhbauer clips a ball in behind for Haas, but Gary Neville covers superbly to concede a corner. Austria are a huge side physically, so, at these set-pieces, they'll fancy themselves more than a harem of Hoxtonites.</p> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Slow start, with no real pattern to the game thus far. \"Why don't you get yourself a TiVo and then we wouldn't have to have this conversation,\" says Richard Tucker, cheerily. And what would they be, then?</p> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Alan Smith cuts infield and fizzes a daisy-cutter from 20 yards; comfortable save. \"I can't tell from this distance: Is the game over?\" asks Ray Vickey. \"Is 0-0 the score? Will Wilber ever play the violin again? Is there life before death?\" Ooookay.</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Like fellas on Rochester High Street, they've kicked off. This is it, then: England post-Portugal, post-Scholesy.</p> <p><strong>Random thoughts from Ian Bruff</strong> \"Considering Before Sunset is 80 minutes long you could see if you can download it and watch that instead of the bore-fest that will be this match.\" Good point, well etc. I could be giddily supping expensive champagne on Upper Street while idly passing the time with Hollyoaks lookalikes right here now, so I could. England to bag a Worzel Gummidge-scruffy 2-1 win, I say.</p> <p><strong>Atmosphere etc</strong> It's a cracking atmosphere, so much so that it'd be intimidating if Austria's side wasn't as modest as a virginal bride's dress.</p> <p><strong>Kit news</strong> Austria are now wearing red - apparently at the behest of former-legend-and-now-half-decent-and-quite-gobby-manager Hans Krankl, which means England, like blushing brides, are wearing white.</p> <p><strong>Hod's the co-commentator!</strong> I promised you wit...</p> <p><strong>Before Sunset denouement</strong> \"Yes, they did,\" says Faical El Khayal. \"But they left an open door at the end, which they will surely cross in the third instalment: Before Tomorrow. Basically they will have twelve hours before Julie has to go under the knife for a new hip.....Now, for some wit.\" Oh yikes. In the meantime, thoughts on the England team: it should be 3-5-2, but it isn't, so we get Bridge and Cole doubling up on the left, and Smith up front. I think the latter makes sense - Defoe, Vassell and Owen are all too similar, and though Smith is dissimilar to Rooney, he at least offers a contrast to Owen. Shame Shaun Wright-Phillips isn't playing, though. Like Dirk Diggler, he's going to be a big, bright, shining star.</p> <p><strong>Team news culled clinically from the wires</strong><br> <strong>Austria:</strong> Manninger, Standfest, Pogatetz, Aufhauser, Hiden, Stranzl, Sick, Kuhbauer, Glieder, Ivanschitz, Haas. Subs: Mandl, Dospel, Hieblinger, Katzer, Kiesenebner, Linz, Kollmann. <br> <strong>England:</strong> James, G Neville, A Cole, Terry, King, Gerrard, Lampard, Beckham, Bridge, Smith, Owen. Subs: Robinson, Carragher, Dyer, J Cole, Wright-Phillips, Defoe, Vassell. </p> <p><strong>Preamble + desperate plea</strong> Having fallen asleep like a worked-to-the-bone minute-by-minute reporter this afternoon with about 10 minutes of Before Sunset to go, I'd love to know how it ends. Anyone? In return I'll pledge to deliver more wit in this report than in 10 readings of The Franklin's Tale. Or some such.</p>",
  "<p>Most people planning round-the-world trips have no idea how many possible combinations are available, according to operators. This week STA posted details of over 200 sample routes on its new Round the World Route Planner, and plans to add more. </p> <p>\"The route planner will give people a chance to research itineraries before they come into the shop - often they just come in and say: 'I want to go round the world.' They're just not aware of the options,\" said a spokeswoman for STA. </p> <p>The number of combinations beyond the traditional London-Asia-Australia/New Zealand-US route is expanding rapidly as airlines add new routes and airline networks, such as Star Alliance and One World, expand. One of the most exciting developments is the incorporation of South African Airways into the Star Alliance group, a network of 16 carriers including Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines. Previously travellers who wanted to fly from country to country within Africa or to the Indian Ocean had to buy separate tickets which added considerably to the overall price; from June next year when SAA officially joins Star Alliance they will be able to use destinations on its network as stopovers on Star Alliance's round-the-world ticket, which starts at \u00a31,099 for five stops (up to 26,000 miles). </p> <p>Other developments that will increase round-the-world options include the launch by Air New Zealand of a Fiji-Wellington service on November 20 and Rarotonga (Cook Islands)-Christchurch on December 1, and the expansion of South American airlines. Lan (formerly Lan Chile and a member of the One World alliance), for example, is planning new services from UK to Ecuador and Peru, via Madrid. </p> <p>Operators say travellers are also unaware how inexpensive tickets have become.

  "Steven Spielberg left his public in little doubt about his strong feelings for Venice this week, describing it as a \"place rich with charm where cinema finds a magical setting\". <p>Many of Hollywood's biggest names appear to agree with him. This weekend Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Cruise, Denzel Washington, John Travolta and Meryl Streep are in the city promoting their movies at the world's oldest film festival. </p> <p>No other city can offer such a spectacular arrival for guests as the watery entrance to the Lido, beneath the sort of clear blue sky for which any lighting-cameraperson would surrender a pound of flesh. </p> <p>But politics has returned to the event this year, with complaints that European film festivals are increasingly in thrall to blockbusters from Hollywood at the expense of less commercial and more dangerous international fare. </p> <p>At the opening ceremony anti-globalisation demonstrators planted a car decorated as a pirate ship on the red carpet in protest against what they saw as the surrender to commercial pressures. </p> <p>\"This should be an event open equally to everyone, not an ostentatious show of wealth and Hollywood power,\" said one of the anti-globalisation organisers.\"There are going to be more disturbances. We want our voices heard.\" </p> <p>Police were on hand yesterday in case the drama continued on the streets rather than on the screens. </p> <p>At issue is the large number of American films - 21 in total - some of which have already opened in the US to middling reviews. The Terminal, directed by Spielberg and starring Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and The Man-churian Candidate, directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Washington and Streep, have long since had their stateside premieres. </p> <p>Many festivalgoers wonder why they needed the extra exposure at a time when it is harder and harder for independent films to be distributed properly. </p> <p>Their questions were perhaps answered by the festival's new director, Marco Mueller, in a pre-festival interview with Hollywood Reporter. </p> <p>\"My pitch was very, very clear,\" he said. \"I told them [the Hollywood studios], 'this is going to be a new Venice, a more American-oriented Venice.' ... We invested over $1m in Dante Ferretti's design for the Palazzo de Cinema; we did that to prove we were serious, that we meant business when we said it was going to be a 'very big splash'.\" </p> <p>Festivalgoers were divided over whether the presence of so many blockbusters was positive. \"We need Venice as a European festival - international, yes, but European,\" said Andrea Karkor, the producer of Il Giardino delle Esperidi. \"A commercial film like The Terminal is not perfect for it ... The real films are the artistic films. Americans make very good commercial films but the idea is not to copy them.\" </p> <p>Eugenio Cappuccio, the director of Sleeping On Air, which is showing at Venice, agreed. \"The festival should have an eye not just for the big blockbusters, but for the independent films to bring in new blood and new ideas. We can't go back to a time of an ideological purity but there has to be an equilibrium. If festivals are just a trick to get money from sponsors and government, it is humiliating. But Venice has its own peculiar importance.\" </p> <p>Some felt that the presence of such high star wattage was understandable.\"You need stars to get people's attention,\" said Francois Ivernel of Path\u00e9 films.\"There is a window of American films but behind that are 120 films being shown here.\" </p> <p>A total of 21 films are in competition and they include offerings from China, Iran, South Korea, Russia and Japan. British film has an interest here in the fortunes of Jonathan Glazer, the director of Sexy Beast and his new project, Birth, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake and Mira Nair's Vanity Fair. </p> <p>Enduring Love, Roger Michel's version of the Ian McEwan novel, starring Daniel Craig, Samantha Morton and Rhys Ifans, is also showing although not in competition for the Golden Lion. </p> <p>But despite the protests and controversy, Venice is still uniquely Venice. One of the most eagerly-anticipated films is The Merchant of Venice, directed by Michael Radford. It has a cast that includes Al Pacino as Shylock, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins, and was partly shot in Venice. </p> <p>Outside the festival, as locals snapped shots of the stars arriving by boat and guests queued up for lemon ice-cream, merchants were selling souvenir T-shirts which bore the legend, \"It's just a movie.\"</p> <p><b>Ones to watch from Leigh to Kidman</b></p> <p><b>Vera Drake</b><br> Directed by Mike Leigh and starring Imelda Staunton, the film tells the story of an abortionist in London in the 50s. Staunton's performance is said to be outstanding and is being talked of in glowing terms. </p> <p><b>Birth</b><br> The story of a woman from New York, played by Nicole Kidman, who believes that a 10-year-old boy could be the reincarnation of her husband. Jonathan Glazer, whose Sexy Beast picked up plaudits from the festival circuit in its day, co-wrote the screenplay </p> <p><b>Howl's Moving Castle</b><br> In the wake of the enormous success of Hiyao Miyazaki's animated Japanese film Spirited Away, this follow-up is keenly-anticipated </p> <p><b>Vanity Fair</b><br> Mira Nair's latest film stars Reese Witherspoon, Bob Hoskins, Jonathan Rhys Myers and Jim Broadbent. The screenplay was co-written by Julian Fellowes who won an Oscar for his screenplay for Robert Altman's Gosford Park </p> <p><b>Wherever You Are</b><br> One of two Italian films in competition and is by actor-director Michele Placido. It tells the story of a doctor who falls for a young paramedic and stars Stefano Accorsi and Placido's daughter, Violante </p> <p><b>Palindromes</b><br> American film-maker Todd Solondz's latest film is about a teenage runaway.

  "<p>Azerbaijan, at 116, lie 59 places below Wales in the Fifa rankings but Mark Hughes expects an exacting test as his men begin the road to Germany 2006. The appointment of the Brazilian World Cup winner Carlos Alberto as Azerbaijan coach is one factor, the city's stifling 40C heat another. </p> <p>The suspended Ryan Giggs is missing from a Wales team who face a hostile 37,000 capacity crowd at the Tofik Bakhramov Republican Stadium this evening. Interest is at fever pitch - prime match tickets are selling for \u00a360, twice the average monthly wage. </p> <p>\"We are in for a stern test,\" said Hughes. \"We came out here with a number of our experienced players missing 22 months ago. We did a professional job then and ended up as 2-0 winners. That experience will help and we researched this trip extensively. </p> <p>\"When you fly 3,000 miles to a country that is four hours ahead of British time there will be problems. But the players, backroom staff and myself are locked into GMT. </p> <p>\"The heat in Azerbaijan is also something to counter. We have done all we can and have put into operation a number of things to assist us to cope. I've ensured the players' bodies remain cool - there will always be plenty of ice available.\" </p> <p>Manchester City's Ben Thatcher is still in bed battling a throat infection. The Dragons hope to pair West Ham's Andy Melville with Cardiff City's Robert Page in central defence, Page's club team-mate Danny Gabbidon filling the gap left by Thatcher. Bolton's Gary Speed, 35 next Wednesday, leads Wales for the 41st occasion. </p> <p>Celtic's John Hartson and Newcastle's Craig Bellamy are Wales's cutting edge. It means West Brom's new record \u00a33.6m buy Robert Earnshaw, snapped up from Cardiff seven days ago, has to be content with a spot on the bench. </p> <p>\"We are certainly stronger for the disappointment of not making the European Championships in June,\" said Hughes. \"Out of a severe setback can come positives and I feel we have more options in the squad now than at any time I've been manager. </p> <p>\"All the lads know the importance of getting six points from our opening games. We need to be going to Old Trafford to meet England on October 9 in a buoyant mood.\" </p> <p> <strong> Wales </strong> (4-4-2, probable): <strong> Jones</strong> (Wolves); <strong> Delaney</strong> (Aston Villa), <strong> Melville</strong> (West Ham), <strong> Page</strong> (Cardiff), <strong> Gabbidon</strong> (Cardiff); <strong> Koumas</strong> (West Brom), <strong> Savage</strong> (Birmingham), <strong> Speed</strong> (Bolton), <strong> Pembridge</strong> (Fulham); <strong> Hartson</strong> (Celtic), <strong> Bellamy</strong> (Newcastle). </p> <p><strong> Azerbaijan</strong> (3-1-4-2, probable): Kramarenko; Sadikhov, Amirbekov, Agayev; Guliyev; Shukurov, M Gurbanov, Tagizade, Mammadov; G Gurbanov, Aliyev. </p> <p>Referee : E Trivkovic (Croatia).</p>",
  "<p>It's one of life's financial nightmares. Your debit card has expired, but its replacement hasn't turned up. With visions of the thief quietly booking his annual holiday using your card, you ring and cancel it. Infuriatingly, it turns up a couple of days later. </p> <p>Last week, hundreds of Nationwide customers were left waiting for replacement Visa debit cards after the building society experienced delays in getting new cards out to its Flex (current) account customers. Some of its branch staff were forced to call the inundated cards hotline to find out what was happening to their own cards, only to be told there were delays. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Nationwide said problems were caused by the holiday period but said all customers should have had their replacement cards by the start of the month. However, lots of people who left for work before their post had arrived will not have received them before September 1 when they became active, and may have cancelled their cards. They now face a 7-10 day wait to be given a replacement. </p> <p>Nationwide differs from most of the other banks in that it rarely deviates from using the Royal Mail's standard post and doesn't encourage its customers to collect cards from branches. </p> <p>It says it will use couriers in exceptional circumstances but remains \"comfortable\" using Royal Mail to send out new and replacement cards. </p> <p>Given how much noise the banking community makes about security - and the failure of Royal Mail to meet its delivery targets - it seems incredible that the majority of UK bank customers still receive cards by standard post. </p> <p>The Royal Mail recently ad mitted that 14m pieces of mail never make it to their final destination, and are either lost or stolen, every year. With pin numbers usually sent out a week before the card, there is nothing to stop a thief taking both - particularly if the bank's customer is away, or unaware their card expires at the end of the month. </p> <p>First Direct, part of HSBC, seems on the face of it to be one of the quickest banks to replace cards that never fall on to their customer's doormats, taking \"between two and four days depending on the circumstances\". </p> <p>It still sends out lots of cards using standard first class post but uses couriers if the customer has had a problem in the past or they live in an area in which post regularly goes missing - which a spokeswoman said mostly meant London. It will happily send cards to customers' work address, local HSBC branch or even to a friend's house - with prior agreement. </p> <p>Barclays and Lloyds TSB both adopt a similar policy of using couriers for customers whose accommodation poses a security risk. A spokeswoman for Barclays said it says it will replace \"lost\" cards within five working days, although this usually happens within three days. Lloyds wouldn't say how long it takes but says it will uses a courier \"where the customer's circumstances require it\". </p> <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, which includes NatWest, is no speedier than Nationwide at replacing cards. Its policy is to replace the card within 10 days - which includes five to seven working days. </p> <p>Interestingly, it sends out its black cards - the ones it gives its most affluent customers (and all new cards) - in an \"inactive state\". Once the customer is in receipt of the card, they simply phone a hotline which will instantly activate it. Until that happens, it can not be used to buy goods or get out cash. </p> <p>One thing in the banks' favour is that most cards being sent out are now chip and pin. These require the user to tap in a pin number when making purchases, and replaces the signature. </p> <p>However, take-up of this has been slow by UK retailers. If you are away on holiday or the thief steals the pin number as well as the card, you'll face a long wait, and possibly a long battle, to get your money back. In such circumstances, it's unlikely the bank will take such a laissez-faire approach to the whole issue of replacement cards. </p> <p><strong>How to beat the cheats</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Be aware when your replacement cards are due - look out for new pin numbers sent by some banks prior to the card's arrival.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you live in accommodation in which you don't have sole access to your post, insist all replacement cards are couriered to you at work or somewhere else you consider to be secure.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If that's not possible, insist on it being delivered to your local branch.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you have not got the card in your possession by the time it becomes active, cancel it. The short-term inconvenience will be nothing to that you will experience if a thief has taken it and runs amok. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Check the start date is correct before you cut up your existing card.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you have a card protection policy contact the insurer to tell them the card number has changed.</p>",
  "<p>From the top of the Pyramid of the Sun in the ancient ruined city of Teotihuacan, Emma Ortega blows a haunting ode on her conch shell and points out a half-built Wal-Mart supermarket in the valley below. </p> <p>Her blood boils at the sight. \"It is an attack on our heritage,\" fumes Ms Ortega, a colourful figure in a small but vocal protest movement against the construction of a Bodega Aurrera superstore, a Wal-Mart Mexico subsidiary, half a mile from the monuments. \"It is an attack on our cosmic equilibrium.\" </p> <p>The movement gives full rein to spiritualists, such as Ms Ortega, who believe Teotihuacan's pyramids and temples possess a special energy that Wal-Mart's presence threatens to throw off balance. </p> <p>The protest is brought down to earth by traditional conservationists who fear that the development will encourage urban spillover from the capital 30 miles away and spoil the largely rural valley for ever. Then there are the local shopkeepers and stall owners from the small town of San Juan who cannot compete with the biggest retailer in the world. </p> <p>Most recently the anti-Wal-Mart campaign in Teotihuacan has attracted support from other campaign groups because of the undeniable importance of the ruins. </p> <p>One of Mexico's oldest and most mysterious civilisations, Teotihuacan boasted a population of up to 150,000 about 300AD. It faded away a few centuries later for unknown reasons and leaving few clues about what life was like. Archaeologists furiously debate issues such as whether it was ruled by kings or collectives. </p> <p>\"A big supermarket so close to the monuments sounds worrying,\" says Javier Villalobos, of the Paris-based International Council of Monuments and Sites, an influential conservation group. Mr Villalobos is planning to visit Teotihuacan this weekend to evaluate the threat. </p> <p>But even if the protesters get international heavyweights on their side, theirs is no easy battle. There are many who welcome Wal-Mart, seeing modernisation where the protesters fear desecration. </p> <p>\"These people who are trying to stop it [the supermarket] don't understand the meaning of progress,\" says Victor Hernandez, a bicycle salesman who is fed up with travelling 15 miles to shop in bulk. He is hopeful that Wal-Mart will give his son a job. \"This is progress,\" he says. </p> <p>The protesters are also having a tough time challenging a construction that apparently has all its permits in order. </p> <p>The development on an alfalfa field, just outside the zone where all building is prohibited, was approved by the archaeological authorities on condition that Wal-Mart employed archaeologists to survey the site. </p> <p>The archaeologists have reported that there is little worth saving beyond a semi-rural domestic compound unlikely to produce anything of value when excavated. </p> <p>They have also questioned the authenticity of the protesters' claims to have found pots and ceramic figurines in waste heaps from the site. </p> <p>It is very difficult to find out what is actually being uncovered behind the perimeter fence; the company refuses to let visitors in and armed guards keep a watchful eye for snoopers. </p> <p>In the meantime, less than a month after construction began the grey concrete warehouse shell is already largely in place and the roof supports will be constructed shortly . </p> <p>Still, Ms Ortega insists that Wal-Mart has met its match in Teotihuacan. </p> <p>\"We are going to make them demolish what they have already built, and return things to the way they were,\" she says. </p> <p>She will need all the extra cosmic energy she can get.</p>",
  "The children who survive the Beslan siege will be given group therapy and one-on-one counselling sessions in the coming months to help them in their struggle to come to terms with the ordeal. <p>A team of child counsellors was flown into Beslan at the start of the crisis and has been on standby, ready to help survivors cope with their horrific experience. Psychiatrists trained in stress counselling will meet teachers, relatives and even neighbours of those families affected. </p> <p>Bereavement support and post-traumatic stress are relatively new concepts in Russia, but expertise in this field has developed radically in the years since the Soviet Union collapsed and scientists were able to share information with colleagues in the west. </p> <p>Boris Voskresensky, a psychiatrist and academic with the Russian State Medical University in Moscow, said: \"There wasn't much understanding of the concept of post-traumatic stress a decade ago. It's no longer the case that people are expected to have Stalinist characteristics of strength and stoicism in the face of crisis. There's a much greater readiness among doctors now to help people deal psychologically with this kind of catastrophe.\" </p> <p>The counsellors would focus on helping the families of those affected, he said. \"They need to be alerted to the possible secondary effects of the trauma, which may take months or even years to develop,\" he added. \"Parents and teachers need to be made aware that their children may develop psychosomatic illnesses, that their school work could suffer, that their behaviour may deteriorate.\" </p> <p>Chechen child refugees, exiled from their homes by the long-running war, have been helped by doctors working for NGOs (non-governmental organisations) in the refugee camps of Ingushetia. </p> <p>\"Everything depends on the strength of the child's relations with his family. If they can help the children build a peaceful, quiet and stable life in the next few years, then this event shouldn't blight their lives forever,\" Dr Voskresensky said. \"Whether or not children living in this part of the world can expect to have a peaceful life is another matter.\" </p> <p>Irina Angel, a child psychiatrist who was born in Grozny, but is now practising in Boston, said she believed doctors in the Caucasus were not as advanced as those in the capital. \"In my experience there will be a much greater emphasis on coming to terms with tragedy through family support, that of the community and through religion. There may still be a reluctance to talk about this with psychiatrists,\" she said. </p> <p>Dr Morris Zwi, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at South-west London and St George's mental health trust, said the children caught up in the Russian school had suffered such profound trauma that they may have flashbacks and nightmares for years, if not the rest of their lives. \"They were exposed to overwhelming stress and fear, where events were not only beyond their control, but beyond that of the adults caring for them,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Many will experience extreme anxiety, hyper-vigilance and wariness, nightmares and sleeplessness, and in some cases, any reminder will trigger graphic flashbacks, as it did for Vietnam vets hearing a helicopter overhead and suddenly believing they were back in Vietnam.\"</p>"
