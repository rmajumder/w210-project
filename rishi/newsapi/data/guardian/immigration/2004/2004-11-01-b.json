  "Yasser Arafat has sustained an entire cottage industry of biographers and experts during his long and eventful career, but the book that comes closest to explaining what makes him tick is by the veteran Israeli journalist Danny Rubinstein. <p>The Mystery of Arafat was published 10 years ago, but it is still an indispensable guide to \"Mr Palestine\" and especially to how, as long ago as the 60s, he cultivated his iconic image: keffiyeh headscarf, three-day stubble, olive-green battledress and pistol on hip. </p> <p>Old and sick he may be, but there was more than a hint of the theatrical when Arafat - sans keffiyeh but grinning bravely for the cameras - left the carefully preserved ruins of his Ramallah HQ last week en route for a Paris hospital. </p> <p>It was the same in 1992: his plane was about to make a hazardous crash-landing in the Libyan desert, so he took off his tracksuit and put on his uniform and holster - determined, if killed or injured, to keep up appearances to the end. </p> <p>Reports of Arafat's demise turn out to have been exaggerated, though the excitement is an indicator of the power of the global brand he has become. But it is clear that whoever does succeed him, and whenever they do so, none will wield his unique, symbolic authority, somehow respected even by his many bitter enemies. </p> <p>And while it may be true that without the man Palestinians call Abu Ammar, Ariel Sharon and a re-elected George Bush would no longer be able to argue that there is no \"partner for peace\", the danger of factional fighting and warlordism in the disconnected territories of the West Bank, Gaza and the refugee camps of Lebanon and the wider diaspora will be very real. </p> <p>Arafat's illness underlines his extraordinary staying power. Every journalist who has ever covered the Middle East has written him off at some time. I confess to burying him first in 1983 after he survived Israel's invasion of Lebanon only to face a rebellion fomented by the Syrians. </p> <p>Next time I saw him in action, he was manoeuvring to hold the PLO together with his stirring but windy rhetoric at the 1987 Palestine National Council in Algiers, months before the outbreak of the first intifada. It was that popular uprising, more effective than years of armed struggle, that led him finally to recognise Israel and renounce terrorism, two fundamental moves he has never withdrawn. </p> <p>Arafat was born for the long haul, and things were looking up in his Tunisian exile in December 1992, just prior to the start of the back-channel negotiations that led to his ill-fated Oslo deal with Yitzhak Rabin. </p> <p>It was hard, as ever, to know exactly what he meant when I spoke to him then: the overheated language masked any obvious substance. He was effusive, friendly, but evasive, a parody of himself. (At the end of the interview, he gave me a mother-of-pearl box with red plush lining - the sort made in Bethlehem before tourism collapsed. Back in Europe, boarding a flight to Tel Aviv, the El Al security man asked: \"Has anyone given you anything to take with you?\" Times were changing, but I decided not to say I had a gift from the PLO leader in my suitcase). </p> <p>Arafat's legacy will be the subject of many books. The moment is certainly past when the world was persuaded, as Rubinstein put it, \"that Arafat was the Palestinian problem and accordingly he and only he could solve it\". His flaws and failures weakened the Palestinian Authority and boosted Islamist rivals such as Hamas. </p> <p>But there is no mystery about one central point: in the 60s and 70s, his people were refugees whose national rights were barely recognised. \"Only in Palestine,\" an astute US commentator wrote then, \"is it still possible for liberals to cheer the cowboys gunning down the Indians or pushing them back into the badlands.\" As Israelis now know to their cost, that is no longer remotely true.</p>",
  "I live in Washington, DC now, after nearly 30 years of living in New York City. Washington is built on swampland, literally, an origin that signals its character. It was designed to look like Paris. There are boulevards, monuments, museums, along with a dangerous, desolate, and impoverished inner city, still not rebuilt from the 1968 riots triggered by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Citizens of Washington, DC do not have any voting representatives in Congress. There was and is no state entity as such. Washington is a district, not quite a city, sleepy and southern in its habits, not fully enfranchised. We are not so much citizens as members of a colony, like Guam or Puerto Rico. <p>Yet this is a swamp devoted to politics. The players in this company town live on political barter, while amassing personal fortunes for themselves. I am not a player. I experience instead an adumbrated form of democracy, articulated most eloquently by the invitation every four years to vote for a president and vice-president. </p> <p>I accept the vote as a primitive expression of democracy out of respect for my suffragist foremothers. They fought so hard for women's civil and economic equality and ended up settling for the vote. I measure this up against a rape or an honour killing and I don't think it counts for much. </p> <p>Anyway, I am supposed to vote for one or the other of two men who are differentiated by style, not by policies. They have more in common with each other than either has with me. They also both lie. </p> <p>I'm voting for John Kerry, and I'm not happy. In 1972, during the Vietnam war, I refused to vote for anti-war candidate George McGovern, even though I had spent most of my young adult life in opposition to the war, because he was anti-abortion. I refused to vote for \u00fcber-liberal, pro-civil rights, all-around good guy Hubert Humphrey because he did nothing while demonstrators were being beaten up by police in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic Convention. In 1976, while my feminist colleagues organised for Jimmy Carter, I refused to sign petitions or vote for him because he was anti-abortion. The first thing Carter did when elected was to have his health secretary end all federally funded abortions, which was the only access poor women had. (Yes, my sisters learned something. Now the legality of abortion, not access, is the feminist litmus test - too little, too late). </p> <p>In 1984, I couldn't bear Geraldine Ferraro as the first woman vice-presidential candidate because her husband, John Zaccaro, owned a warehouse filled with pornography. The Washington Post reported that year that Zaccaro refused to comply with requests for full income and tax disclosures. I voted the first time (in 1992) for Bill Clinton because, on a lecture tour in Texas, I heard George HW Bush - known fondly in retrospect as 41 (George W being 43) - accuse Clinton of un-American activities, which he inferred from a trip Clinton had made to Moscow when he was at Oxford as a student. In 2000, I voted for Ralph Nader. I don't recommend myself as a model for citizenship, except to say that I have always abhorred the lesser-of-two-evils philosophy, and Al Gore let himself be dressed by Naomi Wolf. </p> <p>I couldn't be bothered to vote most of the time because it was almost always a choice between the corrupt and the more corrupt. There is the primordial sludge and then the more pristine amoeba. My guy's the amoeba; the other guy's the sludge. This is a recipe for madness, otherwise known as the American president. </p> <p>Of course, who could have imagined September 11, 2001, and Bush, the war president? And if one were to strike out against state sponsors of terrorism, who could imagine mistaking Iraq for Iran, even though in English they appear nearly the same? This is a George W kind of error. </p> <p>Let me tell you about my amoeba, Kerry. He voted for the Iraq war. Asked if he, knowing then what he knows now (no weapons of mass destruction, no nuclear arsenal), would have voted differently, he said no. He is vaguely committed to putting more soldiers on the ground. He showed up for his political convention as a Vietnam war combatant, not as an anti-war protester, which he was, with honour. He is a multi-millionaire married to a multi-billionaire. His running mate, John Edwards, is more pro-war than he is, less ambivalent and less ambiguous. Edwards is also a multi-millionaire. </p> <p>My amoeba talks about the middle-class; he has conveniently forgotten about the poor. (Edwards used to talk about poverty before he was absorbed into Kerry's attempted seduction of the middle class.) </p> <p>My amoeba calls prostitution a \"nuisance\" instead of a crime against women. Some 25 years ago my amoeba was a prosecutor. He prosecuted at least one rape case, which he won. He was responsible for setting up counselling for rape victims. This was precocious and superb. </p> <p>Fast forward: two weeks before the election, my amoeba recognised that American women make 76 cents against every male dollar and decided to draw attention to this fact. Such is the gratitude of women that my amoeba beats the primordial sludge by as much as 10 percentage points among women in the subsequent polls. He is especially popular with single women who, needless to say, have to support themselves. </p> <p>My amoeba promises improvement. He will support pay-equity legislation. (Have I been in a deep sleep? Is this 1970?) In the parlance of his campaign, he has a plan. He keeps the specifics to himself. He will also raise the minimum wage over several years from $5.15 an hour to $7 an hour which, his campaign reckons, will give 9.2 million women another $3,800 a year. How pathetic is that? He has a plan for health insurance and another plan to produce jobs and a plan to protect social security, that tiny safety net that older Americans, especially women, have against utter poverty. In any other year, this wouldn't be enough to differentiate him from the primordial sludge, because mostly it is not true. It's either the Iraq war or health care, not both. </p> <p>Now look at what George W offers me. First, he gives me his middle initial: \"W is for Women\". I don't want his initial inscribed on me. I find the idea repugnant. He does not recognise the pay differential between men and women. On the other hand, he is against sex trafficking and has said so when addressing the UN. He has strong evangelical support for this position. He is for bringing equality to women in the Arab and Islamic world. I may want it and work for it in the US, but he and his most anti-feminist rightwing advisors, including David Frum and Richard Perle, want women's liberation in the Gulf region, and I do not mean the Gulf of Mexico. Anywhere but here seems to be the general plan. </p> <p>And what is the price for these women's rights? It's a small one. Many bombs must fall and many innocents must die. </p> <p>The Bush/Cheney argument for reelection comes down to this: in Iraq we have created a new site for terrorists and they are so busy there that they won't come here. Vote for us and you'll be safe. Vote for Kerry/Edwards and you'll likely die. One has a choice between massacres there or here. Vote Bush/Cheney. Choose there. </p> <p>Despite the American disdain for irony, electoral politics in the US is nothing if not a lesson in irony. Richard Nixon the anti-communist went to China and ended the Vietnam war. Clinton, prince of Democratic post-liberals, joined with Republicans - in fact, led them - to get African-American single mothers kicked off welfare and to create political cover for those politicians abandoning the poor. He then had the honour of being proclaimed, by Toni Morrison no less, the first black president. And, in this land of political hallucination, maybe he was. He also may be the only black president. </p> <p>What Kerry will do is this: he will get European and even Arab allies to pony up in Iraq; he will intensify the war there; he will bring in more troops. This policy will make it impossible for the Democratic candidate who follows him, or he himself if he runs again, to have anything but a pro-war policy. A rightwing Republican, maybe even a woman, plain-spoken and Reaganesque (or Thatcheresque), will triumph by promising an end to the Iraq war either four or eight years from now. He or she will deliver because the war will be over and the US and its many allies will have lost. This will be another generation's Vietnam with the blame having a certain global quality. As at his convention, Kerry the combatant will have trumped Kerry the anti-war protester. </p> <p>So why is it that I'm voting for Kerry? Oh, right, it's because my Massachusetts amoeba is better than Texas primordial sludge. Make no mistake: I have regional emotions. When someone from Massachusetts, the centre of abolitionist activism, and someone from Texas, in our day and age a symbol of the Confederacy, mix it up, our civil war is being refought. Kerry represents those brilliant abolitionists - and he does it badly. Shame on him. </p> <p>The thing is that I'm scared to death that Bush will win. If Bush wins, we get more terror, charmingly diverted to countries not the United States. I call that a plan. I admire its simplicity. Who said that boy is stupid? Oh, I did, a few paragraphs up: the whole Iraq/Iran confusion. Of course, being dyslexic is not the same as being stupid. </p> <p>The Bush/Cheney plan is the equivalent of a moral sewer. I don't want to roll in that dirt. It's someone else's blood and it doesn't wash off (cf the Scottish play). </p> <p>We dream, some of us, of being able to be good in a better world. The morally reprehensible - the Bush/ Cheney strategy - smacks us between the eyes; and then, and only then, do we vote for the lesser of two evils. But don't forget that they are two evils. Sick to my stomach because he will stay in Iraq, I'm voting for John Kerry. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrea Dworkin's most recent book is Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant.</p>",

  "<p>By the time Hans Christian Andersen was a teenager he was pumped up with a belief in his own destiny, already convinced he was going to be a star. What he yearned for, however, wasn't literary fame, but the dazzle of the stage. He imagined himself singing in the limelight, acting and - for a brief, deluded period - dancing. That was why, aged 15, he presented himself at the house of Copenhagen ballerina Anna Margrethe Schall for an impromptu audition.</p> <p>What Andersen thought he could achieve is unclear. Not only did he have no formal dance training but his gawky limbs lacked any kind of instinctive grace or co-ordination. The audition was a disaster. Schall's maid, assuming the skinny youth at her door was a beggar, initially tossed him a coin and tried to send him on his way. Andersen finally argued his way into the ballerina's presence, but his capering steps and improvised tambourine playing was so bizarre that Schall thought he was a lunatic and had him thrown out.</p> <p>The scene, in all its tragi-comic detail, could easily have come straight from Andersen's own fiction. But so could its eventual happy ending, for while Andersen failed abjectly as a dancer, he still entered ballet history as one of the art form's enduring literary inspirations.</p> <p>It's impossible to put an exact figure on all the ballets that have been choreographed from Andersen's tales. George Balanchine distilled a potent fable about love, art and loyalty from The Steadfast Tin Soldier; Bronislava Nijinska and Kenneth Macmillan both found in The Ice Maiden a stark expression of the Romantic dilemma; The Snow Queen, The Little Mermaid and The Red Shoes (which, of course, inspired the world's greatest ballet movie) have been used many times over.</p> <p>The reasons for the stories' popularity, however, are obvious. There is a clear correspondence between the motifs that dominate Andersen's fiction - romantic quests and magical tasks, disguise and revelation, innocence battling against evil - and the classic librettos of ballet. The Ice Maiden and La Sylphide are both about young men barred from ordinary life by the kiss of a supernatural woman, the heroes of The Snow Queen and Swan Lake are both blinded to faith and trust by the charisma of a cruel, exotic siren.</p> <p>But there is also a particular combination of narrative simplicity and emotional depth in Andersen's tales that lend themselves to expression in dance. Since ballet deals with suggestion rather than exposition, physical epiphany rather than analysis, intuition rather than logic, Andersen is its ideal writer.</p> <p>One of the most remarkable stories Andersen left behind, however, was that of his own life. And now Danish-born choreographer Kim Brandstrup has turned this, too, into dance - a work called The Anatomy of a Story Teller. Brandstrup says that for years he had felt too close to Andersen's tales to consider ever touching them. \"In Denmark you grow up with them; there is such reverence for them. When I was three I was given a bound copy of Andersen's stories that looked like a Bible, which in a way it was.\" It was only when he read two biographies of the writer that Branstrup realised he had found his subject in Andersen's life.</p> <p>In outline, the story of Hans Christian Andersen is almost as magical as his own tales. Like many of his fictional heroes the writer was born, in 1805, with little but his own gifts. His father was a shoemaker, his mother a washerwoman, and their combined incomes could barely provide him with a proper education. Yet, while his background should have left him buried in the mass of the invisible poor, Andersen used his precocious gifts for singing and theatricals to inveigle his way into the favours of rich patrons. He became a mascot of Copenhagen's salons and, after finding his voice as a writer, acquired enormous wealth and celebrity for one of his class. When he died in 1875 Andersen had been feted by kings and princes, claimed the friendship of Dickens, and the adulation of stars like the singer Jenny Lind.</p> <p>Most of the early sanitised accounts of Andersen's life have focused on the rags-to-riches triumph of his career, picturing him as a naive, slightly fantastical pied-piper figure. But Brandstrup found in the new, uncensored biographies a much more complicated personality - one fraught with sexual, artistic and social contradictions. From an early age Andersen was attracted to men, yet he covered his tracks by falling in love with women. He aspired to write on the grand scale - adult novels and epic plays - yet he found his genius in reinventing the humble folk tale. He rose to extraordinary celebrity on the strength of his talent, yet he always felt himself to be an outsider.</p> <p>Brandstrup finds this particularly fascinating. While the trajectory of Andersen's fame was awesome - \"I don't think there are any other artists at that time who made such an enormous social climb\" - he never lived comfortably with his success. \"He remained an outsider; his stories were the only things that were his. They were his way of speaking in a society where he was a stranger.\"</p> <p>Even as Andersen drove himself into the spotlight, part of him shrank from it, and it was this contradiction that sparked Brandstrup's portrayal of the writer. \"Andersen once wrote, 'I am like water', and that expressed for me the way he was always receding from a situation or a person. It was part of his paradox - he was a social climber with a desire to succeed and to be loved but he courted rejec tion. He fell in love with the wrong people. He was dying to be a dancer but couldn't dance. He wanted to write these epic plays for the court theatre that hopelessly failed.\"</p> <p>The Ugly Duckling, Andersen's most famous creation, is usually regarded as his most vivid alter ego. The writer was notoriously ill at ease in his own skin: he was tall, thin and effeminate, with a huge nose sticking out from a pale angular face. Like the duckling he was ridiculed during childhood - a genius born in the wrong body and the wrong situation. But while Andersen mirrored his eventual celebrity in the Duckling's transformation into a swan, the story retained an element of wish fulfilment for him. Andersen never felt he had been hatched into his full glory. He was always yearning for more.</p> <p>For Brandstrup, however, it is the Little Mermaid who is Andersen's \"strongest self-portrait\". \"She was like him in that she courted rejection,\" he says. \"She had this huge desire for the prince but she couldn't have him and she sacrificed herself for him. Andersen had that same quality of deep desire, and shrinking away.\"</p> <p>Brandstrup hasn't attempted to tell the whole story of Andersen's life and work but to use a collage of dance and video images from which hints of the complex reality will emerge. He says: \"Whenever I talk about Andersen here, people always hum that song from the Danny Kaye film.\" The chirpy, sentimental Hollywood biopic essentially presented Andersen as an overgrown child. Bandstrup's mission is to introduce Britain to the grown-up artist.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Anatomy of a Story Teller is at the Linbury Studio, London WC1, from Wednesday until Saturday.

  "As the US election campaign today entered its final hours, the president, George Bush, and his Democratic party challenger, John Kerry, were criss-crossing several states in a final push to secure every available vote. <p>With the polls predicting an extremely tight race, Mr Bush launched himself on a six-state, seven-stop tour stretching from early morning into late night, mostly in the Midwest. Mr Kerry was also working his way across the country, making six stops in four states. </p> <p>The candidates' hectic schedules were expected to bring them within three blocks and one hour of each other at noon (1800 GMT) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - a battleground state in which support for each man is roughly even.</p> <p>As the sun rose in Wilmington, Ohio, this morning, governor Bob Taft warmed up Mr Bush's crowd of several thousand supporters in an aeroplane hangar. \"He's been everywhere,\" he said of the president. \"He's putting his heart and his soul on the line for us, for our families, for our future. We have got to do the same.\" </p> <p>Both sides had grass roots campaigners primed for action to get the vote out. They also had teams of lawyers deployed across the country, braced for legal action at the first sign of polling irregularities.</p> <p>\"I expect this election is going to be decided Tuesday night,\" Mr Kerry told the Associated Press, \"but, given experience, I would be irresponsible if I wasn't prepared to be able to protect every person's right to vote.\" </p> <p>In an interview broadcast today on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Mr Kerry predicted \"a record turnout\" and said he believed Americans were \"determined not to see a repeat of 2000\", when Mr Bush won the presidency after a post-election tussle over the Florida count, which was finally resolved by the supreme court. </p> <p>The president said it was vital to see a clear winner emerge on election night, especially considering how closely the process would be watched around the world. </p> <p>\"We'll see how it goes Tuesday night, but I really think it's important not to have a world of lawsuits that stop the will of the people from going forward,\" Mr Bush told the Dateline NBC television programme. </p> <p>Whichever way the contest goes, the end of the long, bruising campaign is likely to be welcomed - at least privately - by both men, who have begun to appear physically tired in recent days. </p> <p>Mr Kerry showed signs of hoarseness during his speech at a rally in Tampa, Florida, last night. Meanwhile, Mr Bush has stocked up on lozenges and cut down on caffeine, which constricts the vocal cords, according to the presidential adviser Karl Rove. Mr Bush was stumping in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa and New Mexico today, before a crowning home-state rally in Dallas and a night at his Crawford ranch. The vice-president, Dick Cheney, flew to Hawaii for a late-night rally before heading back to the mainland early today. </p> <p>Mr Kerry spent last night in Florida, with two stops in Ohio, two in Wisconsin and one in Michigan lined up for today. Aides said the Massachusetts senator would then fly home to Boston to vote and carry forward his election day tradition - lunch at the Union Oyster House.</p> <p>His running mate, the North Carolina senator John Edwards, was campaigning in the Midwest and Florida.</p> <p>The final scramble caps the most expensive political advertising campaign in history, with more than $600m (\u00a3330m) having been spent by the Bush and Kerry camps.</p>",
  "A Palestinian with five kilos of explosives strapped to his body today blew himself up in a crowded outdoor market in Tel Aviv, killing three Israelis and wounding 32. <p>It was the first such attack since the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, left the region for medical treatment last week.</p> <p>The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO faction, claimed responsibility in a phone call to the Associated Press news agency. The group identified the bomber as Eli Amer Alfar, 18, from the Askar refugee camp near the West Bank city of Nablus.</p> <p>In a statement issued from his hospital bed in Paris, Mr Arafat condemned the bombing and called on Palestinian militants to refrain from harming Israeli civilians.</p> <p>The Magen David Adom ambulance service said most of those injured in the market blast had been taken to local hospitals. According to the Israeli daily newspaper Ha'aretz, two were in \"very critical\" condition, while three others were described as having been seriously hurt. </p> <p>Witnesses said the ground shook with the force of the explosion, which happened close to a dairy in the Carmel market, in the centre of Tel Aviv, at around midday local time (1000 GMT). </p> <p>\"There was a woman whose entire body was torn up, \" shopper Michal Weizman said. \"I was about 10 metres from the shop. I saw lots of people lying on the ground, lots of people wounded.\" </p> <p>Paramedics treated dazed shoppers as police searched the market for more devices. Israel's Channel 10 television station reported that police had found the body of a suicide bomber at the scene. </p> <p>The previous suicide bombing in Israel happened in September, when two Israeli policemen were killed in Jerusalem. </p> <p>Today's attack came as both Israelis and Palestinians were contemplating the possible repercussions of Mr Arafat's departure to France for medical treatment, and could have been designed to show that militants, and not the ailing leader's aides, would set the Palestinian agenda. </p> <p>Within hours of the bombing, Mr Arafat appealed to \"all Palestinian factions to avoid harming Israelis\", his aide, Nabil Abu Rdeneh, quoted him as saying. </p> <p>Mr Abu Rdeneh spoke to the Palestinian leader by telephone shortly after the bombings, and Mr Arafat told him that the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, should also \"take similar initiatives by avoiding harm to Palestinians\".</p> <p>Israel's defence and foreign affairs committee dedicated its weekly session to Mr Arafat's condition. A military intelligence official, testifying before the closed-door session, said he believed the Palestinian leader either has cancer or a severe viral infection. </p> <p>Palestinian officials have been meeting daily, but have been at pains to point out that Mr Arafat remains in control. Meanwhile, the leader's aides said he was \"recovering gradually\", but the French doctors treating him were not expected to announce their findings until Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>Stan Collymore has engaged a team of lawyers, including a QC who specialises in racial abuse, and plans to pursue prosecution of a number of Bath rugby players he has accused of assault. </p> <p>Collymore told police he was attacked by up to eight players from the Zurich Premiership club - including a number of high profile internationals - in Dublin city centre in the early hours of Sunday morning. </p> <p>Bath are investigating the alleged incident and the Rugby Football Union is \"monitoring the matter carefully\" and have asked for a copy of their report. </p> <p>Collymore, 33, gave a statement to police and went to hospital after the alleged incident, which he claims was sparked by a row with Bath players in Dublin celebrity haunt Lillie's Bordello. </p> <p>Collymore told the Daily Mirror today that one Bath player called him a \"kaffir\", a derogatory South African term for black people. </p> <p>Collymore's representative Simon Kennedy insisted his client was blameless. </p> <p>\"Stan was the recipient of a brutal and cowardly assault which took place in the early hours of yesterday morning,\" said Kennedy. </p> <p>\"The assault was both physical and racial. The key part, as far as Stan was concerned, was racial.\" </p> <p>Kennedy said the former England striker will visit a UK police station within the next 24 hours to make a full statement, having identified \"80% of the perpetrators\". </p> <p>\"If the Garda require us to go back to Dublin he (Collymore) will comply because on this issue he is blameless,\" said Kennedy. </p> <p>\"He didn't incite anything whatsoever. Stan was having a great night with some very nice people. </p> <p>\"He was 'karaoke-ing' with 007 (James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan) at one point. Everything was very relaxed, the atmosphere was great. English rock bands were there, it was a nice and happy occasion. </p> <p>\"That turned when various members of the rugby team came in and started throwing insults at Stan.\" </p> <p>Bath were in Dublin for a Heineken Cup match against Leinster, which they lost 30-11 earlier in the day. </p> <p>Collymore claims that the incident was sparked by an exchange of words in which he alleged the girlfriend of a Bath player called him a \"w*****\". A Bath player then stepped in and verbally abused him, claimed Collymore.</p> <p>Collymore said he left the club at 3.30am and went to the nearby Burger King in Grafton Street where he said he again saw the rugby players.</p> <p>He told the Daily Mirror that several people \"started shouting their mouths off\" and he asked \"what their problem was?\"</p> <p>\"I told them I would take any one of them on one-on-one outside, but they suddenly all piled in,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I had no chance anyway, but the minute I saw this one guy coming at me I knew I was really in trouble. He was like the Jolly Green Giant.</p> <p>\"They kicked me all over the street. I went to the ground at one point, but I managed to get up again. There were five or six of them, all just bashing me.\"</p> <p>Police were said to have broken up the clash, but no arrests were made. </p> <p>It has been a troubled year for the controversial ex-footballer, who has battled depression after retiring from the game.</p> <p>In March he checked into the Priory clinic with depression following his confession that he visited \"dogging\" sites near his home to have sex with strangers. </p> <p>His wife Estelle, 26, threatened to leave him when he admitted he had driven to several public places to watch people having sex in cars. </p> <p>He was bound over to keep the peace for 12 months in May following a row with his wife. Collymore walked free from Stafford Magistrates' Court after four charges, including making a threat to Estelle, were withdrawn on condition that he accepted the bind-over in the sum of \u00a3500. </p> <p>Recently, he stormed off Five's TV reality show The Farm following a blazing row with fellow celebrity contestant Vanilla Ice.</p>",
  "<p>* Hello, good morning and welcome to the new-look Office Hours. We've been round and tidied the place up, added some space for weblinks and other vital trimmings in this information age, and generally - I do hope you agree - made the whole thing look hip, groovy and altogether more in keeping with the essential fabulousness of you, our gorgeous readership. But we've kept all the usual articles, as I am firmly against upsetting anybody's morning equilibrium with scarily seismic change, so enjoy. </p> <p>* The other good news is that lunchtime drinking is back. No more chewing on a dry sandwich washed down with a Styrofoam cup of dishwater masquerading as coffee while you continue to hammer away at the keyboard with one hand and file documents with the other - it's off down the pub with you, for a pint of best bitter (or a white wine, of course, if you are a lady) and an hour of revivifying conviviality. </p> <p>The bad news is that lunchtime drinking is back. No more quiet moments for relaxation at your desk with a magazine or for catching up on your private email correspondence while you chow down a delicious sandwich made to your own specifications in the comfort of your own kitchen that morning - it's off down the pub with you for a pint (or a soft drink if you want to endure the derisions of your nearest and far from dearest friends) and an afternoon of struggle against somnolence. </p> <p>Employment law firm Peninsula carried out the research, which showed that a third of office workers had a drink at lunchtime at least three times a week, and three-quarters of those questioned said that they had, at one time or another, got drunk at midday at work. Experts reckoned that the figures showed a healthy inclination amongst employees to start putting their collective foot down about working all day without a break, although they naturally cautioned against taking it too far and turning the office into an all-day drinking den. Nothing puts a dent in the work-life balancing act than rampant alcoholism. </p> <p>* Perhaps this is the time to put in a good work for the traditional break-time beverage. Newcastle University's Medicinal Plant Research Centre reckons that drinking tea regularly can help improve your memory and that green and black tea may eventually yield clues for a new treatment of Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, there is not enough tea in the work to make you remember where you put that vital share-option certificate that your client is expecting at this morning's meeting, so don't waste time boiling the kettle when you should be drafting your resignation speech now. </p> <p>* Don't tell me - you don't make enough money at your job. That's probably because dead people have it all. According to the - possibly slightly morbid - folk at Forbes.com who conduct a review every year of deceased celebrities' continued earning power, Elvis still brings in \u00a321.8 million annually for the Presley estate, while Charles Schulz, creator of the Peanuts cartoon strip, rakes in around \u00a319m despite having long since gone to his reward. John Lennon still brings in \u00a311.4m and J R R Tolkien pockets (in a metaphorical sense only) an impressive \u00a312.5m a year. So now you know. </p> <p>* At least the pay gap between men and women is closing, according to figures just released by the Office of National Statistics. Those of us burdened with the X-chromosome were taking home 85.4% of what men were earning last year. This year, we are taking home a robust 85.7%. If this rapid progress continues, it will only take one more working generation for equality to be achieved and our daughters, the lucky, lucky girls, will be earning just as much as our sons. Hurrah! </p> <p>* Quote of the week: \"It is incredible that ice creams, KitKats, chocolate milk and Krispy Kreme doughnuts can become unappealing. But there comes a point where nature takes over and says, 'You are full'.\" So says Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who, it perhaps comes as no surprise to learn, has already returned to her preferred weight of eight ounces after bulking up to play the eponymous heroine of the upcoming chick flick Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. She may be a brilliant actress but she evidently remains a rank amateur in the lard-eating stakes. My friends and I would consider the ingestion of such foodstuffs to be a mere entr\u00e9e, perhaps to a fine repast of fish and chips, to be finished off, of course, with the kind of pudding that sticks to your ribs for a fortnight or until dislodged by a coughing fit brought on by a futile attempt to run for a bus.</p>",
  "<p>It must have seemed like such a great idea to the managers who decided that staff and customers at B&amp;Q's East Kilbride store should no longer have to put up with a boring old \"hello\" greeting. Instead, why not get them to sing the the ice-breaking Muppets party classic \"Manah manah\" song - and answer with the equally hilarious \"Doo doo, be-doo-doo\" refrain? </p> <p>Oddly enough, employees were not impressed. One worker told the Scotsman newspaper: \"There is no way I'll be joining in. Managers claim it will help morale and team-building but if people talk to me like this, I'll be more liable to tell them to piss off.\" Historically, toe-curling \"meet and greet\" rituals have not gone down well with the British. We've all been guilty of making inarticulate \"hi\" noises at the Disney store's enthusiastic greeters while pounding past them as fast as possible. Frank Gold, occupational psychologist and senior lecturer at Goldsmith's College, London, recalls: \"When the first Gap store opened in Covent Garden, they employed greeters, exactly the same as in the US. And when people saw the greeters, they would turn round and walk back out again.\" </p> <p>Muppet mania is just one example of the strange practices that managers dream up in airless, pie-chart-strewn training rooms. Kate Moore vividly recalls her encounter with one during her first job in telesales. \"Our manager decided that every time someone closed a sale, they should leap up, sound a klaxon, and then everyone else should stop what they were doing to applaud and shout 'Whooo!'\" she remembers with a shudder. \"There was even talk of a tape recorder containing 'inspirational' songs but luckily that was knocked on the head. Even the hard-core salespeople found the klaxon annoying. It only lasted a few weeks, and I only lasted a few months.\" </p> <p>Why are managers so fond of novelty working methods? \"Trying to introduce the fun element isn't necessarily bad,\" says Gold. \"It's supposed to improve team-building and morale and reduce stress. But if you're going to try and make work more pleasant, you should look at the serious aspects such as work-life balance, or whether the workers have properly defined - as opposed to conflicting - roles. There are better, more efficient ways to improve customer service and morale. If 'fun' is the only trick you can think of, you're in trouble.\" </p> <p>Ben Willmott, employee relations adviser for the Institute of Personnel and Development, agrees. \"Research shows that employees are far more likely to have positive attitudes - and are more likely to be productive - if they feel management treats them fairly. If you ask staff out of the blue to sing to customers and this is something most of the staff find embarrassing, it is not a good way of promoting motivation. You must take your employees' views into account. Management may have the power to make unpopular decisions but this is not a wise thing to do when your employees are patently opposed.\" </p> <p>There is a more serious side to the silliness, as Syreeta Ali found out during a \"staff day\" at her not-for-profit organisation. \"The motivational speaker suddenly announced a group hug,\" she says. \"You had to turn round and hug the person next to you. The guy next to me was a techie and he looked absolutely terrified - I was wearing my headscarf and although he might not have known much about Islam, he knew enough to realise I wouldn't want to hug him. I don't get riled up about small things. People have asked me to the pub and I've politely refused with no offence on either side. But the hugging showed a real lack of thought on the part of our managers. A lot of people objected to it - and they weren't even Muslim. I never brought it up with anyone and I wished I had, but I didn't want to look like a killjoy.\" </p> <p>Recent legislation means that such an occurence these days could become grounds for a religious discrimination case. But if you want to try and resolve the problem and avoid doing something you find at best embarrassing and at worst offensive, without recourse to an employment tribunal, what should you do? \"Bring it up with the person who is instigating it, rather than grumbling around the water-cooler with your colleagues,\" says Mary Hartley, a personal development coach and author of Managing Anger at Work (Sheldon Press, \u00a36.99). \"Prepare what you're going to say. Identify exactly what you think and how you feel. And think about what the other person might say. They might accuse you of not being a team player, or of having no sense of humour. In which case, you have to remain calm and explain that whether or not you have a sense of humour isn't the issue. The issue is that you don't feel comfortable doing something.\" </p> <p>Don't demand, don't wave pieces of paper and do try to resist issuing ultimatums. Hartley recommends trying to see the situation from the manager's point of view and showing that you appreciate what they were trying to do while holding firmly to the principle that it is not right for you. \"Be calm, be relaxed and suggest another way of doing things.\" Preferably one that won't end up with anyone breaking out in a cold sweat of humiliation for years to come.</p>",
  "After landing in Britain with an expeditionary force, Julius Caesar said, as we all know: \"Veni, vidi, vici.\" He then exclaimed, and this a fact of which far fewer of us are aware: \"By Jupiter! These woad-wrapped Brits eat a lot of cheese.\" <p>This information was gleaned from an 80-year-old advertisement for a great regional delicacy glimpsed at the North-West Food Lovers' Festival at Tatton Park, in the heart of Cheshire, at the weekend.</p> <p>Caesar, according to the ad copy, wondered why the natives were such a hardy lot and eventually decided it was because they ate so many sandwiches filled with excellent British cheese - unlike the defeated tribes of Gaul, who were a pushover in battle because they ate too much runny brie and camembert.</p> <p>\"It was later discovered by the Romans that the finest cheese in Britain was produced in Cheshire,\" the ad continued. \"For this reason, the Romans built a city at Chester.\"</p> <p>The Bourne family, who milk Friesians in Malpas in the far south-west of the county, have abandoned the woad but stuck with the cheese, producing six varieties with enough punch to stop dead in his tracks any modern legionary looking for bother.</p> <p>\"The family has been making Cheshire cheese for 250 years,\" said John Bourne, wearing a nice white pinny apparently borrowed from his wife. \"And I just happen to care a lot about Cheshire cheese. I used to crawl into the cheese dairy before I could even walk. We have now turned the clock back and are producing an unpasteurised organic Cheshire.\"</p> <p>We took some of his smoked cheese home for lunch and scoffed it with other products from the 70 or so stalls laid out in a cosy marquee. We swigged a tasty Bramley and Cox melange from Cheshire Apple Juice of Kelsall, near Tarporley, Cheshire, and did not stint on the Manchester tart jam (a subtle pink mix of cherries, bananas, sugar, vanilla and coconut) produced by Holly Cottage Preserves of Rawtenstall, Lancashire. </p> <p>Some slightly dense rye bread was fine once we abandoned the knife and dug the chainsaw out of the shed. Having tasted a beautifully unstodgy sample at the fair, we also shelled out \u00a37.50 on a Christmas pud produced by Mrs Ray's Pudding Company, an offshoot of a small bakery business in Prescott, Merseyside.</p> <p>Michelle Ray looked pained when asked if the pudding could be microwaved. \"Steam for best results,\" is the unequivocal message on the lid. \"It's full of good, old-fashioned ingredients,\" she said. \"It's my grandmother's recipe and has not been changed at all. The puddings are made in small batches and then steamed for eight hours.\"</p> <p>She will have turned out 20,000 of them by Christmas, including 8,500 little ones for the restaurateur Paul Heathcote. I forgot to ask whether she will make one for her own Christmas table.</p> <p>One of the problems of a food festival is the temptation to scoff too many free samples. Snugburys, from near Nantwich, Cheshire, was very generous with selections from its 42 flavours of ice cream. \"Have a bit of 'apple pie' - it tastes of both the apple and the crust. And here's 'toffee Evita'. That one's 'white mountain', and this is 'damson and sloe gin'. That's real gin in there ...\"</p> <p>You reel away, dazzled at the thought of the yet more exotic products on offer at the festival: ostrich pate from Weatheroak ostrich farm, near Preston, Lancashire; Sri Lankan chutney from Demels (of Ulverston, Cumbria, rather than Trincomalee); smoked haddock from the Port of Lancaster Smokehouse.</p> <p>The palate and the mind were cleansed with a sample of award-winning black pudding from RS Ireland (\"the real Lancashire black-pudding company\") of Rawtenstall (again). The company's flyer notes that its boss, Andrew Holt, was intronised (a verb that has just baffled the spell-checker) as a chevalier du g\u00f4ute-boudin (knight of the black pudding) at a ceremony in 1998. Good for him.</p> <p>Highlight of the day was a demonstration by the Designasausage company of Disley, Cheshire, on how to use its \u00a355 do-it-yourself sausage making kits, which come complete with mincer, relevant nozzles, spices, casing and recipe books. Clem, the three-year-old son of one of the proprietors, maintained a non-stop, if not entirely coherent, commentary as his mum's apparatus turned out a skinny beef number with added carrots and peas.</p> <p>That night we toasted young Clem with a bottle of Windgather ale from Storm Brewing of Macclesfield. Cheers.</p>",
  "Hudson, Ohio is instantly recognisable, even to people who have never heard of it. Clapboard-sided buildings surround a village green, the bandstand sports red, white and blue bunting and the leafy streets are lined with tidy sidewalks. Right away visitors know they are in small town America. <p>\"It's just like Disney World's Main Street USA!\" exclaimed a recent visitor and, indeed, Hudson's 150-year-old shop fronts look very much like the amusement park's evocation of hometown America circa 1900. Hudson appears so gently familiar that it has been used as a set for movies.</p> <p>I know this town intimately. I was born and raised here across from a cornfield. I rode my first bicycle on its sidewalks and enjoyed ice cream cones at the marble soda fountain at Saywell's drugstore. I cast my first vote here and I got my first job in journalism as the editor of the weekly Hudson Times, circulation 3,200.</p> <p>Coming back today, I find my hometown is polarised by the presidential elections. I have not seen neighbours and friends so bitterly divided and dismissive of each other since 1970, when Richard Nixon was president and people argued about the Vietnam war. Animosity was so thick then you could cut it with a knife. Just 10 miles away, at Kent State University, four students were shot dead by government troops and people in Hudson had raging rows over whether or not those killings were justified.</p> <p>George W Bush and the Iraq war have reopened Hudson's political fault lines and rekindled simmering antipathies. The stakes are high here as Ohio is rated as a key swing state. It is a populous midwestern state that boasts 20 electoral college votes, one of the largest in the country. It has big industrial cities like Cleveland and Akron, agricultural areas and plenty of small towns like Hudson. This cross section of urban and rural makes Ohio a bellwether state which picks the winner in almost every election. No Republican has ever won the White House without taking Ohio; Democrats have only done so twice.</p> <p>Hudson's residents know Ohio's strategic importance of Ohio and the political campaigning is at a fever pitch. \"I invited my neighbour over for dinner and once we started talking about politics and the war in Iraq, we had a blazing argument. I became so angry, I couldn't believe it,\" said Linda Crotteau, 61, who supports John Kerry. \"I had to go over to her house the next day and apologise for being so angry. But now she no longer waves when we see each other.\"</p> <p>Mrs Crotteau, a speech pathologist, finds she cannot do campaign work in Hudson because she loses her temper with the many Bush supporters. Instead she is canvassing for Kerry door to door in the nearby city of Akron. \"The main issue here in Hudson is the war on terror and the war in Iraq. For people in Akron, particularly the African-American community, the issue is the economy. People are struggling. One woman told me, 'If Bush wins again, we will probably lose our house.' Bush is making us a country of the rich and the poor. The middle class is being squeezed out.\"</p> <p>Mrs Crotteau's mission to convince undecided voters to vote for Kerry starts at home. Her husband is not sure who he will vote for. \"I don't really talk to him about it, because I know that a hard pitch from me will turn him off. But I think the news about Iraq will do it. When we watch the news, we just look at each other and he knows what I'm thinking.\"</p> <p>One neighbour asked a member of her bridge group not to park in front of her house because she had a Kerry sticker on her car.</p> <p>Hudson has traditionally been a conservative town that is solidly Republican. The Republican headquarters on Main Street are decked out in bright red, white and blue elephants and staffed with cheerful volunteers. But when they are questioned about the issues, their message is serious. \"I don't feel sorry for poor people,\" said one woman. \"They had choices.\" When the Observer's photographer, Gary Calton, says that he is working with me, the Republican sniffs, \"Oh, the Meldrums, they are a very liberal family.\" Liberal is said with a sneer as if it is a dirty word. </p> <p>But there are signs that Hudson's longtime reputation as a Republican centre is changing. \"The joke has always been that you could fit all Hudson's Democrats into the phone booth at Saywell's drugstore,\" says Susan Terkel, a leader of the Kerry campaign in Hudson. \"But now lots of Democrats have come out of the closet. The former mayor is campaigning for Kerry and lots of others. We had a gathering of 400 people which was exciting. But now some Republicans are boycotting the restaurant where we had the meeting. Isn't that terrible?\"</p> <p>Hudson is now having \"the war of the signs\". \"At night people take down signs they don't like. Last week someone went to a house that had a Kerry sign and burned a big W in their lawn,\" said Mrs Terkel. \"It's getting ugly.\" An 84-year-old widow had two Kerry signs taken from her front yard, but when she put up two small American flags next to her third Kerry placard, it was left alone. Alex Arshinkoff has a 32ft sign for Bush on his front yard on one of Hudson's busiest streets. The sign is so big that it violates city codes and Mr Arshinkoff has been fined $75 per day. Mr Arshinkoff, who is chairman of Summit County's Republican party, is taking the matter to court in order to keep the sign up.</p> <p>Everyone in town goes to the Hudson high school football games on Friday nights. The football is a draw but so are the performances by the marching band. With 320 students in snappy blue and white uniforms playing shiny trumpets, trombones and tubas as they march in briskly changing formations, the band's numbers are full of razzmatazz. It's not surprising to learn that the band frequently appears on national television.</p> <p>Flag waving patriotism is also on display at the football match and several people sport Bush buttons. \"OH4W\" is worn by many. \"You can talk about the election campaign here at the football game, as long as you support Bush,\" grumbled one mother. \"But if you support Kerry, everybody jumps on you and questions your patriotism, so I just keep my mouth shut. But I am voting for Kerry.\"</p> <p>From all appearances, Hudson, Ohio looks like a typical American small town, with unified, cohesive population. But I can see that the current presidential election campaign has highlighted divisions that will be evident long after voting day.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Ben Affleck</strong> has launched a blistering attack on his former cohort, Jay and Silent Bob director Kevin Smith. Affleck has starred in five films for Smith, though it currently seems unlikely that there will ever be a sixth. Smith recently complained about Affleck's refusal to show up for the official DVD launch of their last film together, Jersey Girl. But Affleck has now hit back, according to The Scoop website. \"It wasn't enough that I went to Vegas to play in his lame charity poker tournament for the DVD launch of Jersey Girl, but I also had to go out to his fucking store,\" it quotes Affleck as saying. \"He's opening a store where all he's doing is selling more T-shirts of him and his jackass friend [Jason Mewes, who plays Jay], and he's roped an entire generation of thinking it's worth spending $30 on [a T-shirt] and $50 if he signs it. I mean, the whole thing is a complete travesty.\" The upside of this spat, of course, is that it looks as though film fans may yet be spared Jersey Girl 2.</p> <p><strong>Gerard Depardieu</strong> has signed on to co-star in Last Holiday for Paramount Pictures. The film is a remake of the 1950 British comedy which starred Alec Guinness as lowly clerk George Bird, who embarks on a swansong vacation after being given months to live and winds up being mistaken for an eccentric aristocrat. The remake installs Queen Latifah in the Guinness role. Depardieu's previous English-language roles include the 1990 comedy Green Card and a supporting turn in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.</p>",
  "The filmmaker Michael Moore has announced a large-scale effort to combat dirty tricks during tomorrow's US election by stationing hundreds of people with video cameras outside polling stations. <p>\"I'm putting those who intend to suppress the vote on notice: voter intimidation and suppression will not be tolerated,\" Mr Moore said in a statement, wading into a controversy in which Democrats accuse Republicans of planning to reduce turnout, especially among ethnic minorities, by employing thousands of people to stop voters at the polls and challenge the validity of their registrations. </p> <p>Mr Moore, the director of the documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, said 1,200 professional and amateur videographers would descend on polling stations in Florida and Ohio, the two battleground states that have been the focus of the most serious allegations. The last few months have seen an unprecedented drive to register new voters, especially in black neighbourhoods of Florida and throughout Ohio. </p> <p>But the new registrations could be deemed invalid as a result of errors made on the forms, from corner-cutting by workers paid to sign people up, or from deliberate fraud. </p> <p>In Milwaukee, in the swing state of Wisconsin, Republicans produced a list of 37,000 voters whose addresses they said were questionable. They argued that all voters should be required to show identification at the polls tomorrow, otherwise they would instruct thousands of poll workers to challenge people. </p> <p>But Milwaukee's city attorney, who represents no party, said hundreds of addresses on the list had already been confirmed as valid, and local Democrats warned that voters could be disenfranchised simply for failing to include their apartment number as part of their street address. Meanwhile, continuing chaos seemed inevitable in Broward County, Florida - home of the notorious \"pregnant chads\" of the 2000 election - where thousands of voters are likely to end up without a vote after their absentee ballots went missing. </p> <p>Some replacement ballots were sent last week by courier, but 2,500 were only posted at the weekend - and by regular mail. </p> <p>Legally, if the voter lives in the US, the ballots must arrive back at Broward County, whether by hand or by post, by 7pm tomorrow. </p> <p>The US postal service told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel it was \"really asking a lot\" to expect the ballots to reach voters in time. </p> <p>\"There's nothing we can do about those,\" countered Brenda Snipes, Broward's election supervisor. \"Those were last-minute requests that just came in this week.\" </p> <p>More widespread problems could result from a nationwide shortage of at least half a million poll workers, the US election assistance commission said yesterday. It pleaded with businesses to give volunteers the day off work so that they could help operate polling stations and count votes. </p> <p>\"If the criminal justice system didn't have access to jurors, the criminal justice system wouldn't exist. Poll workers are just as important as jurors,\" said DeForest Soaries Jr, the commission's chairman. </p> <p>Around the country, scattered reports of suspicious campaigning activities continued to surface. </p> <p>In North Carolina, Republican party officials distanced themselves from a Washington-based group, the College Republican National Committee, which was reported to have been targetting elderly people with confusing fundraising calls, prompting several to give money without knowing how much, or to whom, they had donated. </p> <p>Across the border in South Carolina, the Democratic party said a letter was circulating which wrongly informed voters that they could be arrested at the polls if they had outstanding parking tickets or child-support payments.</p>",
  "The videotape that was to prove Osama bin Laden was alive, apparently well and in combative mood, first surfaced on a doorstep in the plush neighbourhood under the Margalla hills, on the edge of Pakistan's capital, it was claimed yesterday. <p>A few streets away from the house in Islamabad of the disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, an unknown hand dropped the al-Qaida leader's latest message at the door of the television network al-Jazeera. </p> <p>\"When I opened it, I knew it was a great scoop,\" said Ahmad Muaffaq Zaidan, the Pakistan bureau chief of al-Jazeera. </p> <p>Yesterday, Newsweek magazine was also reporting on the Bin Laden trail, quoting US officials saying that \"just a few weeks ago\" the net had been closing on an al-Qaida operative in Pakistan who might lead them to Bin Laden. \"It looked like we were really close, maybe one or two people away. There was a lot of optimism around here,\" one official said. </p> <p>Mr Zaidan had met Bin Laden twice before September 11 and had also received an audiotape from him in 2002. But such drop-offs are now a touchy subject, reflecting Pakistani sensitivity over reports that Bin Laden is hiding in the country's lawless border areas. </p> <p>The information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, told the Guardian yesterday that the tape drop story was a \"joke\". He said: \"It's garbage to suggest that someone could have just dropped the tape there. These days it's not possible for a guard to just take a package without knowing what it is.\" </p> <p>Confirmation that Bin Laden, despite some speculation, is alive, and still gunning for US targets, has set alarm bells ringing in Islamabad as well as in Washington. Pakistan has gradually displaced Afghanistan as the focus of the war on al-Qaida. Two assassination attempts in December on Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, confirmed that Islamic militants had turned their sights on his US-allied government. Since then President Musharraf has taken the war back to them, offering generous bounties for al-Qaida related militants and ordering police searches in parts of cities such as Karachi and Lahore. </p> <p>His security forces scored coups such as the arrest of the al-Qaida computer expert Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, and the gunning down of Amjad Hussain Farooqi, a key al-Qaida suspect. </p> <p>But the greatest activity has focused on the lawless northern borders where Bin Laden could still be hiding out. Thousands of Pakistani troops have been deployed to the tribal areas where they have carried out bloody assaults on suspected al-Qaida hideouts. More than 270 militants - many of them Uzbek, Chechen or Arab - have been killed. A high price has been paid: more than 170 deaths among the police and army, civilians caught in cross fire, and a dangerous escalation in local tribal tensions. And still, the biggest catch of all remains on the run. </p> <p>\"We are looking desperately [for Bin Laden]. We want him. There are so many people and so many agencies searching,\" said Mr Rashid. </p> <p>British special forces and MI6 have joined the hunt on the Afghan side of the border just as, more recently, they have been trying to locate in Iraq the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a professed al-Qaida disciple. </p> <p>But there is little proof that any of the armies tracking Bin Laden are even looking in the right place for him. Ever since his trail evaporated in the caves of Tora Bora in late 2001 there have been few specific leads. </p> <p>A flurry of Pakistani offensives in restive South Waziristan, on the Afghan border, were mounted against foreign fighters but not specifically for the hunt for Bin Laden. \"He could even be in Iran for all we know,\" said one observer in Islamabad. </p> <p>Friday's tape offers some of the strongest clues for months. The Islamabad drop suggests that he may be in the region, and a senior British anti- terrorist official described the tape itself as a \"vital piece of evidence\". </p> <p>In common with the CIA, British intelligence and security agencies are closely studying the full video for any clues it may give - not so much about Bin Laden's whereabouts but about his intentions. </p> <p>British officials are struck by Bin Laden's reference to the Israeli bombing of tower blocks in Lebanon in 1982. He claimed, almost certainly wrongly since it is believed the plan was only put to him in the mid-1990s, that the Israeli bombing inspired the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York. </p> <p>However, the reference is assumed to be an attempt by Bin Laden to garner support among Palestinians and Shias. British intelligence and anti-terrorist officials have in the past made much of Bin Laden's apparent lack of interest in the Palestinian cause as well as the Palestinians' resistance to his message. </p> <p>And if anything, the latest video has scotched months of conspiratorial rumours that the US forces would pull off the capture of Bin Laden just before this week's presidential election in the US. </p> <p>\"If we knew exactly where he was,\" Major Scott Nelson, a US army spokesman, told reporters recently, \"we would have a very happy day and a happy election.\"</p>",
  "<p>Up to 10 million immigrants might be needed in Britain by 2025 to ensure pensioners can continue to receive \u00a380 a week from the basic state pension, research out today suggests. </p> <p>Researchers at Cass Business School in London have developed mathematical models of the likely course of the pensions crisis, which point to the need to work longer, save more and allow in more immigrants who will pay sufficient tax to keep the system afloat. </p> <p>The most gloomy scenario - that productivity and real wages will not increase between now and 2025, and so generate more money for paying pensions - says 10 million migrants would be needed if we did not work longer, pay higher national insurance contributions and kept living longer. </p> <p>The basis of the problem, it says, is that we are living longer while birth rates have fallen. In 1990, there were four workers to every one pensioner. By 2030 there are expected to be nearly two pensioners for every five workers. </p> <p>\"The UK is facing some tough decisions in terms of state pensions provision. We can increase our work force via migration, we can work longer or we can increase contribution payments - even if we do this it only keeps the current state pension system stable until 2030,\" said Cass's Professor Lee Mayhew. </p> <p>If the government wanted to resist the immigration pressures, the research shows that in another scenario, where the retirement age was raised to 70 from 65 between 2020 and 2030 and more of the over-50s stayed in work, immigration pressures would not appear until 2024. </p> <p>The five scenarios in the research, which factored in options such as raising pensions only in line with inflation, cutting them back or changing the retirement age, all showed the pension system becoming more difficult to manage after 2020. </p> <p>\"The only other option is to combine these factors - work longer, increase migration and increase contribution levels,\" said Professor David Blake, another of the report's authors. </p> <p>These are similar conclusions to those of Adair Turner, who compiled a major report into pensions for the Pension Commission, which was released last month. </p> <p>Mr Turner's report estimated that 12 million people - one in five Britons - were not saving enough for their retirement. Of those, 60% are not paying into any kind of pension fund. Some experts have estimated a pension savings shortfall of \u00a360bn.</p>",
  "A loyal minister assured me that Tony Blair contemplates the creation of giant casinos with a high-minded distaste. But representatives of the US gaming industry - the men who hope to make a fortune from the folly of gamblers - have convinced him that roulette, blackjack and slot machines will be a powerful ally in his campaign to reinvigorate the inner cities. The lobbyists were, the Blairite added by way of mitigation, \"at him for weeks\". The day after I was assured that the prime minister was no worse than weak-minded, the Guardian revealed the outcome of a breakfast meeting with the \"multinational chairmen's group\". Directors of British American Tobacco convinced him that a proposed public inquiry into allegations that BAT condoned smuggling should be replaced by an investigation, which, since its conclusions could not be made public, would be (indeed was) forgotten. <p>It was not the first time that Tony Blair had shown sympathy for tobacco interests. After a meeting with Bernie Ecclestone, formula one was granted temporary relief from rules that prohibited cigarette advertising. But nicotine has not been granted favours that other commodities were denied. Another minister - far removed from the casino apologist - told me that British Aerospace board members were in Downing Street so often, he suspected that they had a key to the garden gate. </p> <p>It seems that the prime minister is susceptible to lobbying. But there are no allegations of secret meetings with pensioner groups, clandestine conversations with representatives of asylum seekers or furtive trysts with homeless organisations. The prime minister only gives audiences to the rich and powerful. No doubt he will argue that he helps everyone who can move the economy forward. But the lobbying of government - from Downing Street downwards - has grown to levels that raise fundamental questions about standards in public life. </p> <p>The prime minister's personal financial integrity is beyond question. The corruption is intellectual. It is based on the belief that what is right for industry must be right for the country. Complemented by the fatuous notion that businessmen always know where their companies' best interests lie, his faith in private enterprise makes him a sucker for every executive with a Harvard Business School diploma and a big bank balance. </p> <p>He ought to know better. Two early advisers were the fallen leaders of BA and GEC. Directors are usually more accomplished at the art of protecting their own incomes than at the science of pursuing their country's economic interests, but wealth impresses Tony Blair. His personal finances are a matter for him alone. However, when prejudices that should be confined to the prime minister's lifestyle influence his attitude to policy, they become legitimate subjects for comment. The attraction of affluence makes Tony Blair Britain's principal proponent of the Protestant fallacy. He believes that wealth and virtue are indivisible. </p> <p>That view is reflected in the relaxation of rules that once required a decent period to elapse between a civil servant passing out of Whitehall and into the employment of a company that his or her department had once \"sponsored\". The willingness to blur the boundaries of propriety is a characteristic of many of the most enthusiastic \"reformers\" who rallied to New Labour 10 years ago. Proponents of \"the project\" who have taken up the dubious business of lobbying and euphemistically entitled public affairs are doing no more than reflecting the ethos the prime minister encouraged. </p> <p>Only idiots want the government or the Labour party to be antagonistic to private industry. Quite rightly, a vast majority of the economy will always be privately owned. Ministers must do their best to create an environment in which it thrives. That does not require them either to assume that it is faultless or to overlook its faults. The abiding sin of public limited companies is the belief - actually enshrined in the laws that govern them - that making the largest possible profit is their overwhelming obligation. In pursuit of that objective, they sometimes cut corners - as, allegedly, BAT did when it attempted to avoid customs duty. </p> <p>A prime minister who condones that behaviour or who does not realise it is happening diminishes himself and his government. The same is true of a prime minister who - even in the noble interests of inner-city regeneration - succumbs to the blandishments of lobbyists from Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Perhaps it is true that Tony Blair is guilty of nothing worse than gullibility and exploitation. But naivety is a strange defence for his supporters to advance. And the consequences of whatever makes him behave like this are even stranger policies for a Labour leader to advance. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A group of 81 Liberian and Congolese refugees, many of them victims of torture and rape, are to arrive in Bolton today under a pioneering Home Office scheme to resettle some of Africa's most vulnerable refugees in Britain. <p>The group have been assessed as \"exceptionally vulnerable\" by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and until now have been living in squalid camps in Sierra Leone and Uganda where they still face a risk of persecution. </p> <p>They are only the second group to arrive under this scheme and follow a group of 69 refugees who were settled in Sheffield earlier this year. </p> <p>The project was launched last year by the home secretary, David Blunkett, as a way of opening up a legal gateway into Britain for those refugees in need of protection, without them risking their lives being smuggled across Europe by people-traffickers. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett had hoped that 500 refugees would arrive in the first year of the scheme and 1,000 in the second year but the hostile political climate towards asylum seekers in Britain has led to a strong reluctance by local authorities, including Liberal Democrat and Labour, to take part. </p> <p>A total of 34 refugees, about half of them young children, are expected to arrive in Bolton today. The rest will arrive by the end of the year. </p> <p>Many of them fled Liberia during the civil war only to face further persecution in the camps where they took refuge in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>The group is made up of 50 Liberians, including 17 families, and a further 31 people who originally fled from the Congo to camps in Uganda. </p> <p>The Home Office has been working with Bolton council, Refugee Action and a local housing association to help them resettle. A Home Office spokesman said the housing being provided was already vacant and not at the expense of local people. The Home Office is also footing the cost of providing schooling, training for employment and English language classes. </p> <p>The refugees have also gone through a brief \"orientation programme\" about life in Britain before they left Africa. </p> <p>Immigration minister Des Browne said they were all exceptionally vulnerable, at risk and in need of permanent resettlement. \"They have suffered horrific abuse not only in their country of origin but also in their country of refuge, and have been living in unsuitable, squalid conditions,\" he said. \"They are survivors of rape and torture and many of them have seen the murder of close members of their family.\" </p> <p>Home Office ministers are hoping to finalise an agreement with Birmingham city council to take a further group of UNHCR refugees. But the lack of interest from other local authorities has disrupted the attempt to resettle genuine refugees in Britain. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Home Office is due to expel from Britain a mentally ill immigration detainee on Tuesday, in a move that appears to be at odds with their stated policy in this area. </p> <p>A senior psychiatrist claims that Bonnett Mbombila, a 33-year-old Congolese man held in Forest Bank prison after he was found to have worked illegally in Manchester, and a registered paranoid schizophrenic, will be unable to access the medication he requires in the country of his birth. </p> <p>The Home Office said it would not normally remove a mental patient to a country where the appropriate medicine is unavailable. A Home Office spokesman said: \"We would seek expert guidance to ensure that the wellbeing of the person being removed is maintained. If vital medical treatment is not available the situation would be reviewed.\"<br><b>Eric Allison</b></p>",
  "Alan Milburn famously left the cabinet to spend more time with his family and now, back in the cabinet organising Labour's general election, his family is spending more time with him. <p>Sitting at the desk of his plush Cabinet Office rooms overlooking Horse Guards Parade is one of his sons on half-term, clicking through computer screens with the opaque sang-froid of the teenager. This is work-life balance in action. </p> <p>Mr Milburn, six weeks into his new job, appears to have got though his rocky re-entry when everything he said was read through the prism of an attack on the ousted Brownites. Indeed he makes a point of stressing that people from the Treasury are sitting on the newly key election committees. \"We are up and running and everyone has bought into it,\" he says. </p> <p>He even refers admiringly to the \"progressive consensus\", the aspiration set out for Labour by Gordon Brown in a major speech a fortnight ago. </p> <p>He acknowledges the media search for division \"will always happen. You're faced with a choice about this all the time. Do you not do an interview or make a speech because you're afraid of the headline? But you cannot get yourself into that position.\" His big message is that Labour now has an election machine and battle plan, different from the two previous elections, and it will strive to inspire, not just scrape home into a third term. </p> <p>\"All the time, events swish around you, but you have to have a plan and stick to it,\" he says. \"Our plan is first set out the record and achievement, emphasise the pride in Britain, and that Britain is working; secondly make a strong 'future offer' that reconnects and reassembles the New Labour coalition. Lastly, set out the dividing lines with our political opponents so that the next election becomes a choice for the country, not a referendum on this government .\" </p> <p>He vows: \"Our contention is not somehow just to coast it. We are going to take on our opponents, we are going to fight every seat we currently hold in order to win them all.\" </p> <p>His buoyancy stems from recent polls showing Labour well ahead of the Conservatives, despite Iraq and plunging trust in the prime minister. The party's private poll gives Labour a six-point lead. </p> <p>He senses the public are still \"with Labour\", but in need of re-persuasion. </p> <p>\"People are basically with us in spirit, but they want to be absolutely convinced that the issues and concerns that affect their lives are those that affect our lives and are the ones we are going to deal with.\" He lists the critical issues as crime, pensions, childcare, choice, equal pay and social mobility. </p> <p>\"The trick between now and the election is to narrow the gap between those who identify with Labour and those who say they intend to vote Labour.\" The trick also requires trumpeting Labour's record without tottering over into hubris, or else Labour will lose what he describes as \"the permission to persuade\". </p> <p>\"The big fundamental problems the country faced have been addressed,\" he claims. \"Mass unemployment has been replaced with full employment, cuts in public services with investment; a boom and bust economy has been replaced by a stable economy. Finally, there has been a decent constitutional settlement for the country. </p> <p>\"The country is probably in a more optimistic mood than many of us give it credit for. We almost have to make Labour the patriotic party.\" </p> <p>At the same time, there has to be renewal. \"After seven years issues go wrong, issues come up, things don't happen, people have disagreements with one another, so you have to reignite the energy.\" </p> <p>He denies Labour is liable to be crushed by a pincer movement of liberals alienated by Iraq, and working class voters disillusioned by crime and asylum. Nevertheless, he accepts the government may be a hostage to events in Iraq. He says: \"We have got a plan. Elections happen in January and that will produce a more stable Iraq. It is an enormously difficult and divisive issue, but I do not think the 'troops out' position is either realistic or right.\" </p> <p>\"Both [Charles] Kennedy and [Michael] Howard have made a big error of judgment on this. They might think it might reap a harvest in the short term, but come an election, people will start to ask whether they can be trusted with running the country. </p> <p>\"The Tories,\" he asserts, \"are in a lot of trouble. They must have hoped for a far bigger post-conference bounce in the polls than they got. The strategic mistake is worrying more about their right flank than their centre flank. It's very difficult for them when New Labour has taken so much of their centre ground, but, as both [Chris] Patten and [Michael] Portillo have argued in recent weeks, politics in the end is won, not on the extremes, but in the centre.\" </p> <p>Their overall strategy, symbolised by the appointment of the Australian Lynton Crosby as campaign director, will be \"to peddle pessimism and undermine confidence. We have got to expose that.\" </p> <p>But he seems equally determined to assault the Liberals, explaining he has brought in the campaigning MPs Fraser Kemp and Tom Watson \"to take them on, rather than just letting them come at you. We have got to be on the front foot, not on the back foot\". </p> <p>As the Liberal Democrats progress, so the bar of scrutiny is also raised, he says. </p> <p>He promises to take seriously those \"who are traditional left leaning, liberally inclined and contemplating voting for Charles Kennedy\". He intends to point out that the \"Orange Book liberals\", such as Mark Oaten, represent \"a new generation formulating policies that are more Tory than the Tories\". </p> <p>But this does not mean he will backtrack on the party's commitment to choice and market mechanisms in public services. </p> <p>\"Choice is one thing that has always been limited to some people - getting on the housing ladder, having fulfilling employment, getting a decent education and being able to progress in your life. </p> <p>\"I am obsessive that the opportunities I had in my own life are available to other people. We don't do this to pander to consumerism, but because it means spreading opportunity and social mobility,\" something he admits that has declined over the last 20 years. </p> <p>\"We favour reform not as some form of anodyne, value-free process; it is reform for a purpose and that is to expand opportunities. </p> <p>\"In London, if you have got enough money, you either buy your child out of the education system, or you move home in order to locate to a decent school. That is what happens. The way through that is raise standards through city academies and specialist schools.

  "<p>The modern full-back tends to be rated by his counter-attacking ability, but yesterday Matt Burke was back in the No.15 shirt, and it was his last-ditch tackle deep in injury-time that ensured Newcastle's second consecutive victory in Europe. </p> <p>It was not any old clattering tackle, for this was the rugby equivalent of that Gordon Banks save in Mexico City. Perpignan's bull-like flanker and captain, Bernard Goutta, had taken an inside pass from a fellow forward and, at pace, had only to plunge over. Indeed, he was over the line when something amazing happened behind him </p> <p>As man-of-the match Jamie Noon explained: \"Burkie hit him so hard that he turned him, he got hold of the ball with his legs sort of curled around it and turned Goutta up on his back. A fantastic hit. That close to the line you expect a forward of that size and that calibre, to score. He [Burke] brings everything to the table.\" </p> <p>So Burke outdid the rescue he had effected just a couple of minutes before. As the French were flying into the very same corner, after a surprise breakout through the middle, it was Burke's quickness of thought and sleight of hand that managed to pinch the ball as it was being transferred, and swivel to clear to touch. </p> <p>Such nerve and bravery did no more than hand Newcastle a deserved win. They had started by far the stronger of the two teams, with Burke delivering a penalty after only two minutes. </p> <p>They comfortably held their own at the scrummage and had the far better lineout - stealing plenty of ball as well as securing their own - and once managed to march a maul 30 metres. All this was scarcely believable against the Catalans, whose bruising pack took them to the 2003 final - and has been at the centre of numerous citing controversies. But perhaps they were just conforming to the French caricature of being lions at home and lambs away, with only one altercation really worth the name. </p> <p>At any rate, the Falcons enjoyed a greater authority than they have known in home Premiership games. That was amply illustrated by their try. As a Perpignan lineout throw was stolen, the ball was driven infield in a series of dynamic mauls and then the backs released. Matthew Tait took advantage of a stretched defence to execute an inside step that left full-back Leon van den Heever sprawling, and open up an undefended line. </p> <p>Ironically, with Burke being such a force for Newcastle, it was another Australian Manny Edmonds, who delivered a riposte for Perpignan. Fast on the break, he raced through the centre, bounced off the only player in his way, Michael Stephenson, and scurried on to the line. It was a let off for the home side when he failed to convert from close to the posts. </p> <p>Newcastle seemed to lose concentration after half-time, and as the game when into the last quarter the Catalans began to play with new belief and purpose. In denying them, Newcastle nailed another defensive triumph to their mast, after prevailing in the siege of Newport last week. </p> <p>Newcastle improbably join Wasps and Northampton as England's only undefeated clubs, and it is a fair bet that Burke will continue to play full-back. \"I've said for some time it's his best position,\" said director of rugby Rob Andrew. \"He waltzed through terrible conditions in Newport as if he was in a training session. He makes everything look so easy. He's just a fantastic player.\" </p> <p> <strong> Newcastle: </strong> Burke; May (Taione, 64), Tait, Noon, Stephenson; Walder, Charlton (Grindal, 74); Peel (capt, Isaacson 40), Thompson, Hurter (Ward, 42), Hamilton, Grimes, McCarthy (Setiti, 64), Charvis, Dowson, </p> <p><strong> Try:</strong> Tait. <strong> Con:</strong> Burke. <strong> Pens:</strong> Burke 3, Walder. </p> <p><strong> Perpignan:</strong> L van den Heever (Giannantonio, 60); Bomati, Marty, Hume (Manas, 40), Luger; Edmonds (Laharrague, 75), Durand; Debaty, Grelon (J-G van den Heever 75), Mas (Chobet, 76), Alvarez-Kairelis, Porcu (O'Driscoll, 71), Le Corvec, Goutta (capt), Tonita (Robertson, 71). </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> N Whitehouse (Wales). </p> <p><strong> Attendance: </strong> 6,705.</p>",
  "<p>So the curse of the Bambino is ended; Harry Frazee, the man who sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees so he could fund a musical that fateful day in 1919, can rattle his bones in peace. For the first time since September 11 1918 the Boston Red Sox are World Series champions after a clean sweep of the St Louis Cardinals. The Red Sox dug-out erupted, the players did gymnastics of delight and a lot of people, wherever they watched, wound their way home very, very happy. </p> <p>\"There have been so many people in their 90s who said: 'I just want to live long enough to see one championship before I die,'\" said the Sox chairman Tom Werner. \"This is for them.\" </p> <p>But were Grandmother and Grandfather Red Sox still ecstatic on Thursday morning as they looked out into the red-and-gold New England autumn or did they hesitate, remembering that their reason for living - or at least for moping and hoping - had disappeared. Eighty-six years of hurt gone, just like that. </p> <p>The Red Sox had been the chokers, the losers, the laughing stock of baseball. They had won five of the first 15 World Series titles but, since 1918, not a bean. They suffered chants of \"1918\" every time they played the Yankees and their canon of near misses became American sporting folklore. </p> <p>Businesses were raking it in with \"Reverse the curse\" memorabilia including an ice cream with hot fudge, caramel-covered bases and chocolate-covered peanut balls. And, according to one report, a hacked-off local radio star Eddie Andelman, a loyal Boston fan all his life, had had his tombstone prepared with the words \"Eddie Andelman - They Never Won It In His Lifetime\" (The Red Sox typically waited until the poor man was away before they pulled the rabbit out of the hat; Andelman was attending his son's wedding). </p> <p>Of course life will go on for the loyal fan - with the bonus of being able to buy a souvenir T-shirt, name a new baby after the entire team, read the back catalogue of the fan Stephen King and cast a presidential vote for the Red Sox cap-wearing John Kerry. But, come the new season, can he or she really bear to swash down soda watching a team fulfilled? Cope with an entirely new emotion and expectation? And experience the sudden delight which fans of other teams will share when the Red Sox get their first bloody nose of the season. As those at Highbury could warn them, no one likes a smart-arse, however cute the legend or cerebral the manager. </p> <p>There is a certain down-on-your-luck comradeship that comes from supporting a team on a losing streak, the longer, the more heartbreaking, the better. It is the same doggedness in adversity that affects those who still insist on buying and selling carrots in pounds and ounces. People like to get knee-deep and wallow in the pointlessness of it all. A win throws everything out of kilter. </p> <p>Of course not everyone loves a loser. The West Indies cricket team were never so well supported as when they were terrorising the world with their rotation of four long-limbed and brain-crushingly fast bowlers. When they started losing, many turned to basketball, football or even baseball (although not the Red Sox presumably.) And the famed British love of the underdog did not do Manchester United any harm after they ended a 26-year wait for the league title by winning the first Premiership in 1993. Similarly in the last two weeks, Leeds Rhinos - rugby league's best-known chokers - have reported that winning the Super League grand final to secure their first championship since 1972 has led to a surge of interest in the club. </p> <p>But what is there left for disaffected Red Sox fans who really cannot rise to the challenge of supporting a winning team? They will not find any succour in going out to Foxborough to watch the New England Patriots, the Super Bowl champions. </p> <p>They could head down the interstate and transfer their affections to the Chicago White Sox, without the American League title for 87 years, or move across town to the Chicago Cubs, who last won the World Series in 1908. </p> <p>Or they could look across the pond to baseball's English cousin and start supporting a suitable county cricket club. Northamptonshire should be a safe bet.</p>",
  "<p>John Buchanan, the world's outstanding cricket coach, confessed yesterday that he has been impressed by the new-look England side and is interested in another crack at the county game, six years after being forced out of Middlesex by a group of senior players. </p> <p>The tall, grave and scholarly looking Buchanan was relaxing by the pool at the Taj Mahal Hotel here yesterday, two days after masterminding Australia's first series win in India for 35 years. </p> <p>He said: \"It's a bit like India. When I do a job I like to complete it. There's definitely unfinished business there. But whether I get another opportunity I don't know. I mean, even when I finish with Australia there's family and a lot of other things to consider.\" </p> <p>Buchanan is planning to be in England for next summer's Ashes campaign. But he took charge of Australia five years ago last month - making a stronger team stronger still and guiding them to 16 consecutive Test victories - and he admitted yesterday that every coach has a shelf life. </p> <p>\"I've always felt that way. The only way you can stay a coach is by shifting everyone out of the team, so you're talking to a new group of players, or by moving club. </p> <p>\"As soon as I feel I no longer have the ability to make some contribution to this team or bring about some change, it will be time to move on. </p> <p>\"I was at Middlesex at the wrong time. A couple of years later it might have been the right time. But I'm a bit of a fatalist and I believe everything happens for a reason.\" </p> <p>When the long-serving Middlesex coach Don Bennett left Lord's in the 1997 season the club set up a working party, under Paul Downton, to seek out a successor. After a rigorous search Downton came up with Buchanan, who had led Queensland to two Sheffield Shield wins - including their first - in three years. </p> <p>Buchanan did not play Test cricket and appeared in only a handful of games for Queensland. When he played in England it was not for a first-class county but for Cambridgeshire and Oldham. </p> <p>But \"The Professor\" turned himself into an outstanding coach, using sophisticated computer analysis and some less conventional ideas, such as group poetry reading sessions. And he wrote notes until his hand ached. </p> <p>His work ethic did not appeal to senior Middlesex pros, however, especially Mike Gatting and Mark Ramprakash, and the county finished next to bottom of the championship. </p> <p>When Buchanan left the club Gatting was appointed director of coaching, with a much wider brief than the Australian had ever been given. It was county cricket at its myopic worst and the move failed. </p> <p>A bitter sounding Buchanan said a little later: \"County cricket is the true servant of mediocrity,\" adding that every county had at least three \"impostors\" on their books. \"In England you've paid players and in Australia we've got unpaid players. But in Australia we've got professionalism and in England there's no professionalism, or very little.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, though, the man who has added brain to Australia's brawn sounded more conciliatory when he said: \"There is still too much cricket in England. You can't sustain high quality performances over that amount of cricket. </p> <p>\"You need thorough preparation for each game, then a debriefing period afterwards. But losing to England in the ICC tournament this year highlighted for me that things have improved a great deal there. </p> <p>\"By the time these countries meet next year it could be an interesting series.\" Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff have been England's outstanding players this year but it is others who have caught the coach's eye. </p> <p>\"Andrew Strauss is a good solid kid who knows his game and won't be intimidated. I knew him a bit at Middlesex and then he came to Australia a couple of times. Rob Key is the same. And behind the stumps Geraint Jones brings the same approach. </p> <p>\"What's happening in England under Michael Vaughan reminds me of what happened in India under Sourav Ganguly a little while ago, when Mohammad Kaif, Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag came into the side. </p> <p>\"These England players don't carry a lot of baggage. They're self-confident with a real passion for their country. When you stack it together with winning games and tournaments that builds upon itself.\" </p> <p>Buchanan's methodical planning to win in India was an example of why he is regarded so highly. \"We've shown patience, which we didn't last time. I wanted fall-back positions, different bowling strategies and field placings. We got to know the conditions and the India batsmen inside out. </p> <p>\"And there was great preparation and back-up, with ice vests and neck coolants and we always had bench guys, two or three players to run on and bring the batsmen drinks, towels, chairs and umbrellas.\" Middlesex's loss, it seems, has been Australia's gain. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> India's captain Sourav Ganguly said last night that he would miss the fourth and final Test, starting on Wednesday, because of an upper-thigh strain.</p>",
  "<p>The Slash U ranch near Tucson, Arizona, 4am on a grim Wednesday. It's dark, there's a 30mph wind and cold, heavy rain. The yard outside the ranch house is filled with barking dogs and horses watch over fences as a TV news crew assemble their gear. Having rejected a windswept field as a possible site for their report, the five-man team from Sky have settled on a barn. This is partly to protect their kit from the rain but also because the tackroom is straight out of Bonanza, loaded with cowboy saddles, reins, crops and horse feed and the rancher is wearing a stetson. </p> <p>The team are exhausted. They've been up since 2.30am, having got to bed at 11pm the night before. Now they're about to go live into London's lunchtime news bulletin. Stumbling through the gloom and biting rain, they've somehow managed to rig a bank of glaring lights that penetrate the pre-dawn shadows. Behind it they've set up a futuristic wi-fi base unit to handle a feed from a digi-cam. Outside, in the satellite van, Dan Williams, Sky's Washington news editor, is watching anxiously on a monitor as US correspondent Andrew Wilson mounts one of the rancher's horses ready to deliver his piece to camera. The disembodied voice from London says they'll be coming to Dan in five minutes, at which point there's a tiny flicker and all the power in the barn snaps off leaving everything in pitch black. </p> <p>Williams would be forgiven if he started to cry. Instead, with an almost chillingly inhuman calm, he sets about fixing the power as the seconds tick away. Engineers and cameramen blunder through the wet, re-rigging and e-plugging as the feed from London counts down remorselessly. Finally, with less than 60 seconds to go, the lights flash back on, Wilson tugs on the horse's reins and they're live to London just as if they'd been cued up for an hour. </p> <p>Here's why the crew are huddled in the Arizona downpour. The US presidential election is the biggest news story in the world. It comes at a time when news is more instantly available and minutely examined than at any other time in human history. Every news channel, every national broadcaster with a reasonable news operation and every big newspaper in the world needs to cover Bush v Kerry, as well as the bloggers like Daily Kos who are now getting accreditation. This leads to some incredible numbers. </p> <p>The BBC has 200 people dedicated to covering the election, including engineering and technical staff, Sky News has about 50, with a similar presence from ITN's ITV, Channel 4 and Channel Five news teams, plus radio news and the national dailies, which brings the total UK media presence to almost 400 people. Spreading out across Europe, these numbers are replicated. There are four Russian television news operations with teams in the US; German, Spanish, Italian and French news channels, state and independent broadcasters as well as their print compatriots. Even Croatian state television has a presence. Then there's North Africa, Asia, Oceania - indeed, latest estimates put the number of foreign journalists covering the story at almost 8,000 people - roughly the equivalent of the UK's military presence in Iraq and probably better equipped. </p> <p>And yet it's not an easy gig. For one thing, the candidates treat the foreign media with contempt. During the 2000 election, a reporter from a German newspaper asked Karen Hughes, Bush's senior adviser, a question. Half way through her answer, something struck her. \"Who do you work for?\" she asked. \"A German newspaper,\" he began. \"Then what am I wasting my time talking to you for?\" she asked, somewhat rhetorically, and turned on her heel. One Kerry aide was equally specific. \"To us,\" he told the Washington Post last week, \"foreign media are about as useful as lice.\" </p> <p>As a result, when it comes to media access, rationing is extremely harsh. There are ten media places on Air Force One and Kerry's campaign plane and these go to the four US television networks - Fox, CBS, NBC, ABC - as well as CNN and the big daily newspapers (whose journalists are charmingly known as \"scribblers\"). These people form the \"gaggle\", the small group of hacks who get daily briefings from the campaign team, outlining the theme for the day at the various speeches the candidate plans to give. On October 27, for instance, the Kerry gaggle travelled with the senator as he visited Iowa, then Minnesota, back to Iowa and on to Ohio. They were pre-briefed that Kerry planned to pick up on the New York Times story about missing explosives in Iraq, managing to feed reports into every bulletin - even those that went out before a speech had been made. </p> <p>Following close behind each campaign jet are the press charters, two planes booked by the White House Press Club, who have to keep close tabs on what the plane in front is doing just in case a tight poll forces everyone to veer off to Florida. Foreign media can apply for a place on one of these charters, but it costs a couple of thousand dollars a day and that's a lot of money to pay to have the candidates ignore you. </p> <p>What's more galling to international superstar anchors is how important tiny local cable stations and newspapers suddenly become. The decision is going to be made in the handful of states that aren't already cast-iron Republican or Democrat loyalists. At the start of the final week, that meant ten states; Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania plus Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico and Wisconsin - although by Wednesday, previously pro-Gore Michigan started to look like a Bush target. The local media in those states suddenly achieve a status commensurate with that of CNN or NBC. Last week, for instance, some overseas broadcasters began talks to gain access to Carl Rove, the mastermind behind the Bush campaign. He blew them off for lunch with the chief reporter of the Ohio Sentinel. </p> <p> Newspapers can respond in different ways to this news drought. They could, for instance, propose a letter-writing campaign to an obscure county in Ohio. That might generate one or two column inches. For 24-hour news channels - whose viewers expect something on the election in every bulletin - this is a nightmare. Sky has decided to try something different. As well as two reporters leapfrogging the campaign trail, they've hired a private jet for Williams' team and sent them out into America to tap the mood of the population. Wilson will file three live reports a day from three different areas in five different states where election issues are felt at the sharp end in a series of packages known as Sky Across America. </p> <p>\"It's partly to sidestep the anti-foreign media bias and partly a bid to explain the campaign to the Brits,\" Williams explains. \"So far, we've been to logging camps and the wilderness in Oregon to look at environmental issues as well as a marine base and a vets' barbecue in South Carolina to cover the military vote. Arizona is right on the border with Mexico and they're turning back 600,000 illegal immigrants a year - with estimates that two out of three get through. Locals have reported Iranians coming over and fear al-Qaeda may smuggle themselves over the border.\" </p> <p>With 8,000 hacks roaming the nation looking for a story, of course, there's always the possibility of a crossover. Moving on from the border ranch, the team hooked up with a gang of Tombstone vigilantes who head out to well-known immigrant routes, armed to the teeth. These people seem unlikely media stars. For one thing, their activities are very close to illegal. For another, they show up in a 4x4 sporting the bumper sticker \"CNN Lies!\" Nonetheless, these citizens have already featured on two other news channels, one of them Russian. \"They had awfully heavy cameras,\" one vigilante recalls. \"We saw a bunch of illegals and chased 'em for four miles and those poor Russians were pretty tired out.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile on the stump, Sky's other US correspondents are covering the swing states, with Ian Woods tracking the candidates and, this week, Keith Graves focusing on Florida. On Monday, Woods was at Love Park in Pennsylvania for Bill Clinton's appearance alongside Kerry - a bizarre spectacle in a long, thin park packed with 80-90,000 ecstatic Democrats who only had a sideways view of their idol as the stage had been rotated 90 degrees to face the media. By Wednesday, as Williams and co pushed through the Arizona scrub with the gun totin' vigilantes, Woods was covering Bush in Youngstown, Ohio. \"We usually have a rough idea as to where the candidates are going about 72 hours in advance,\" he explains on the way to the commuter airport where the Bush team have booked a hangar for the rally. \"Then they give you the address with 24 hours' notice.\" </p> <p>He arrived at the airport at the same time as the Observer, a Dutch and a Belgian journalist. As they pulled up, the last of the Ohio media were trickling into the press entrance, at which point it was shut by the secret service, who told the Europeans to hoof it round the airport to the public entrance, a journey of four miles through gridlocked traffic. After two miles, they abandoned their cars and finished the journey on foot, Woods arriving in situ two minutes before going live. \"To be fair, even the local media thought the event was badly organised,\" he says wryly. </p> <p>The following day, Williams and Wilson are filming in a TV evangelist's studio, asking Dr Richard Roberts about the Christian vote. \"I have been preaching that we need to support a man of God who governs well,\" Roberts intones, whilst cynical London cameramen struggle to avoid blaspheming as they wire up their kit and drop things on their feet. \"And that man is Bush.\" The crew are slightly suspicious of Roberts when the studio manager takes them round the studio, showing off the digital editing suites. \"That set up would cost several million dollars,\" cameraman Martin whispers. \"Where's he getting the money?\" </p> <p>As the Sky jet lands in New York for the final day, filming NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly at Ground Zero, Woods is covering the Kerry/Springsteen rally. This is a big one for the non-English speaking media, because they don't need to translate Springsteen's songs. Woods is swamped by Japanese camera crews, but the Yanks are late, allowing him to nick some transponder times from CBS and do a live set-up for the first time this week. </p> <p>The teams chat on Friday morning to plan the next few days. Monday sees Kerry and Bush both making seven separate visits, and New Jersey and Hawaii - previously Democrat safe states - suddenly look vulnerable. That could mean covering more than 6,000 miles in 24 hours. \"We're going to need another plane,\" says Williams, wistfully.</p>",
  "<p>Politics<br> <strong> How to net voters in the US</strong><br> </p> <p>Howard Dean's former campaign manager Joe Trippi believes that if Democratic Senator John Kerry loses to President George Bush on November 2 the Democratic party will face a fissure of a size to allow the creation of a viable \"third force\" in US politics and upset the dominant two-party system. This new third force, he says, will be aided by the internet. </p> <p>\"If Kerry were to lose there is potential for an uprising in the Democratic party,\" Trippi told the audience at Poptech, a conference that looks at the impact of technology on popular culture, held in Camden, Maine last week. \"If the Republicans lose their party could also fracture but [not] as big.\" Trippi believes that by 2008 a candidate using the net to raise money will be working outside of the two-party structure. </p> <p>\"I believe that the only hope for our democracy is the internet,\" Trippi said. \"The internet is enabling the American people to change a system that isn't working.\" </p> <p>Of course, there have been third parties in the USA before - remember Ross Perot - but, according to Trippi, the internet and its ability to reach people in a more efficient manner will turn a third party into a powerful player. Trippi is credited with reinventing political campaigning in America with the use of the internet to raise money for the Democratic maverick Howard Dean. The former governor of Vermont broke the record as the Democratic candidate who raised the most money - some $50m - from donations of $100 or less. </p> <p>Dean's presidential campaign also pioneered dialogue with supporters via the internet. But he failed to win any primaries and bowed out of the race. Trippi said: \"John McCain tried to reform the Republicans from within and was crushed. Dean did the same and was crushed. Before the net the urge to reform had nowhere else to go.\" But Trippi believes that the internet's time has come: \"Politicians spend their time saying 'look at me', but Dean was the first one to say, 'look at you. You have the power'.\"<br><strong>Kate Bulkley</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Advertising</strong><br> <strong> Sending out a mixed message</strong><br> </p> <p>Even though the government is the UK's second biggest advertiser, it is worried its multi-million pound media spend is not reaching everyone. Which is why, a year ago the central office of communication (COI) launched an inclusivity unit to look at how to engage marginalised audiences such as the old, those who don't speak English and the disabled. </p> <p>So far its research has focused on ethnic minorities and how effectively the messages in its TV ads are getting through to them. Take the government's anti-drugs \"Frank\" campaign, which was created for the Home Office. On the face of it, the message seems simple: if you're a parent and think your child is involved with drugs, talk to him or her. If you're a child and you're into drugs, talk to your parents. But take this message to some minorities and you open a can of worms. </p> <p>Some parents refuse to consider that their kids are using drugs because they're forbidden by the Qur'an. Others worry that if the neighbours hear them talk about drugs, it will seriously damage the chances of them marrying off their daughters. </p> <p>One Asian couple interviewed by the unit thought their heroin-addict son was addicted to chocolate when they saw silver foil covered in brown splats in his bedroom. \"Mainstream ads and media just don't work,\" says Sean Larkins, who heads up the unit. To reach these communities, mini advertising campaigns are developed. </p> <p>As part of its effort to get Asians to broach the subject of drugs with family members, for example, it created an information pack containing conversation starters, such as a themed card game. The unit also created its own campaign to run alongside the star-studded ads for the National Blood Service. Those that did come forward were offended by questions about their sexuality and whether they had ever lived in west Africa. \"It's impossible to collect blood without asking these questions, so we've had to work with marketing agencies that know how to engage these communities. </p> <p>\"Teachers, NHS professionals and Citizens Advice Bureau staff are our media,\" says Larkins. </p> <p>That's not to say the unit hasn't been applying traditional media planning techniques as well. During Ramadan it sponsored a mosque in Tower Hamlets, east London, to carry a message about quitting smoking. It provided all the food for the Iftar - the breaking of the fast - party. \"A bit about giving up smoking was even included in the sermon,\" says Patricia Macauley, the COI's ethnic minority consultant. Now that the unit has survived its first year and got buy-in from the Home Office and the Department of Work and Pensions in particular, what's on the agenda for the second year? \"Age and our ageing society,\" says Larkins.<br><strong>Suzy Bashford</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Television</strong><br> <strong> Straight choice for a gay man</strong><br> </p> <p>James is a regular gay guy. He just wants to be loved. He has a thick neck, perfect teeth and looks like he's spent most of his life grooming himself towards life's ultimate trophy of becoming a domestic airline steward. </p> <p>He is a perfect, 2D, TV gay. Will he find love on Boy Meets Boy, America's first reality gay dating show, and Channel 5's controversial new daytime import from the States? He has 15 contestants to choose from, all of whom look like they have spent most of their thinking lives grooming themselves towards ... oh, you get the idea. Even the straight ones. Here's the USP. Some of James' prospective daters are pretending to be gay in order to win a cash prize. Ambitiously, migrant presenter Dani Behr - herself in the grips of some ghastly reality-esque makeover that has left her resembling Big Brother transsexual Nadia Almada attending a fancy dress do as Pamela Anderson - infers that there is some sort of sociological value to all this over the opening credits: \"In a world where gay is the norm and straight must stay in the closet, will boundaries be crossed? Can stereotypes be shattered? Will romance prevail? Find out when two worlds collide, when we bridge the gap between gay and straight!\" </p> <p>Quite how asking straight men to prostitute themselves for a poor gay chap who knows nothing of this rather cruel ruse is bridging any sort of gap is never fully explained. But the game of guessing who's gay and who isn't proves to be moderately good fun. Boy Meets Boy (starting November 11) is one of a legion of shows commissioned on the back of the success of the US Queer Eye For The Straight Guy. Gay men have become TV's newest and most bankable playthings. Queer Eye itself has come in for some unnecessarily shortsighted criticism. As Boy Meets Boy proves, you can borrow all the campy ephemera of its sometimes stereotypical world, but you can't fake its heart. The central conceit of Boy Meets Boy - conning a gay guy into falling for straight - is mean, but not nearly as mean as the winning prize: a trip to that infamous, buoyant gay mecca, New Zealand \"You can bungee jump there!\" informs Behr, to a suitably puzzled James. Herein lies the problem. Boy Meets Boy doesn't seem to like homosexuals very much. Hardly the best start for the world's first gay dating show.<br> <strong>Paul Flynn</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Magazines</strong><br> <strong> Vice triumphs over sleaze</strong><br> </p> <p>Vice editor Andy Capper is on a roll. \"There are too many bad writers out there. Five or six magazines went down last year and if you looked at the contributors' panel they had 65 people all getting ridiculous word rates. We rewrite everything, and if you don't like it don't work for us.\" </p> <p>Vice magazine is that rarest of beasts - a success story in the cut-throat style sector which has seen the closures of Sleaze and The Face. Vice, which launched in the UK two years ago, made \u00a3100,000 profit last year and is expecting to clear \u00a31 million in 2005. Its 70,000 copies are distributed free every month in selected clothes and music stores across the country. </p> <p>\"The newsstand model for niche magazines with our circulation doesn't work anymore,\" says publisher Andrew Creighton, a former ad manager on i-D magazine. \"Everyone who distributes our magazine is also our readership. We get instant feedback, far better than any NRS survey. </p> <p>\"People say we're not making money on the cover price, but [our rivals] don't either. To sell 30,000 copies they have to print 100,000. We have 100% pick up rate. The idea was to create something you could sell, then give it away free.\" </p> <p>Vice began in Montreal 10 years ago. It is now in the US, Japan and Australia, and Capper and Creighton are overseeing its expansion into continental Europe, beginning with Scandinavia. They are also moving into music (the Streets is signed to Vice in the US) and television, with a documentary called How's Your News? for Channel 4, in which five severely disabled reporters cover the US election. With a clean, unfussy design, Vice combines real life (The Vice Guide to Being A Whore) with features such as Was Jesus a Fag?. There's bands like the Libertines, and lots of lists. \"Some of the things we cover are shocking by their nature,\" says ex-Bizarre editor Capper. </p> <p>\"We are probably at the ceiling now of advertisers who understand Vice [in the UK], which is why we're going into other forms of media,\" admits Creighton. \"We want to be the first true international magazine and cherrypick the best writing.\" They are even opening a pub. In east London's trendy Shoreditch, of course.<br> John Plunkett</p>"
