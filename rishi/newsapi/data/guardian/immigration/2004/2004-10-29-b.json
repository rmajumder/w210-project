  "<p><strong> Our Lady of the Forest, by David Guterson (12hrs 30mins, Isis, \u00a319.95)</strong> </p> <p>Even without the rain - as much a feature of America's Pacific northwest as midges are of Scotland - the characters in Guterson's latest novel are a pretty depressing bunch. Permanently swathed in rubber boots and anoraks, they struggle to make a living in the once lucrative forests of Washington state where, thanks to over-felling, the lumberjacks are now unemployed. Into this rain-sodden landscape comes Anne, an abused teenage runaway from Oregon with claims remarkably similar to Bernadette of Lourdes - except that Anne had her vision of the Virgin Mary while she was out picking magic mushrooms. Despite the hordes of pilgrims who descend on the small backwoods town, this is less a story of religious fervour than a sceptical and often very funny picture of a community rich in oddballs, such as Anne's self-appointed handmaid, less interested in building a church with the donations than heading off to Mexico for a permanent vacation. I missed the love story that underpinned Snow Falling on Cedars, but Guterson's talent for showing you what makes people tick is, as always, breathtaking. </p> <p> <strong> Light on Snow, by Anita Shreve (6hrs 30mins, TimeWarner, \u00a313.99 CD)</strong> </p> <p>Trees feature prominently in Anita Shreve's latest novel too - not the giant redwood forests of the west but the quiet, dark and deep woods of Robert Frost's New England. Walking among snow-covered birches, Dillon and his 12-year-old daughter come across an abandoned newborn baby wrapped only in a bloodstained towel. Two years earlier Dillon's wife and infant daughter were killed in a car crash near their New York home. Traumatised and embittered, he throws in his job as an architect in Manhattan and opts for self-imposed exile in New Hampshire. Cue the abandoned baby, the police, the baby's mother, and suddenly everything changes. Daughter confronts father with his inadequacy, cowardice and inability to face reality. Renunciation may suit him, she says, but what about her own life? Despite the promise of such gripping early novels as The Weight of Water and Fortune's Rocks, Shreve seems to be heading down the same women's-interests-only route as Joanna Trollope with first The Pilot's Wife and now this. I liked it because I occasionally relish descriptions of domestic minutiae, but I doubt that many men apart from obstetricians would.</p>",
  "<p>Two of the greatest 20th-century British poets of place, Ted Hughes and WH Auden, came late in their lives to resemble the landscapes they loved. One thinks of Hughes's great granitic head, more tor than skull, and of the Auden of the 1960s, his face deeply creased and grooved laterally, like the limestone pavements of Yorkshire in which so much of his early poetry is grounded. </p> <p>John Muir also grew into likeness with the mountains he adored. The most famous photograph of Muir - the guardian of Yosemite, the family man, the esteemed essayist and memoirist - shows him in profile, seated on a boulder of his beloved Californian granite. The tones of his shirt and the colour of his beard rhyme perfectly with the pale grey of the rock beneath him. He is half Victorian patriarch, half geological extrusion. </p> <p>Muir (1838-1914) himself never knew quite what he was, and it delighted him not to know. \"I am a poetico-trampo-geologist-bot. and ornith-natural, etc.!!!\" he wrote gleefully to a friend in 1873. Looking back over his long life, one sees why he had to weld together such a compound description of himself -there are so many John Muirs. There is Muir the long-distance tramp, vagabondising 1,000 miles from Indianapolis to the Gulf of Mexico. There is Muir the mountaineer, stalking the high ridges of the Sierra Nevada range in California, and making the first ascents of several of its biggest peaks. There is Muir the geologist, decoding the glacial origins of the Yosemite Valley. There is Muir the explorer, opening up unmapped regions of Alaska in his 50s. There is Muir the botanist, striding through the pollinous bee-meadows of the Sierra, counting the 10,000 flower-heads in a square yard of sub-alpine pasture, and worshipping in the crypt-light of the sequoia groves. There is Muir the activist, successfully lobbying Congress for the creation of a national park in the Yosemite region. And there is, of course, Muir the nature writer, finessing a prose style which, more purely and ringingly than any other, communicates the joy of being out of doors. </p> <p>If you have heard of Muir before, it will probably have been as the third name in a sentence which includes Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Too often, at least in Britain, Muir is tucked away like this, lost in the pockets of the two great American sages of nature. True, Muir's environmental metaphysics were less instantly complex than those of Emerson or Thoreau. But his soul was tingled by landscape in ways which Thoreau's and Emerson's never were, and it is this which makes him more enduringly important than either of his predecessors. </p> <p>Reading Walden, or Emerson's essays, the natural world comes at you deodorised and desensitised, insulated behind the double glazing of logic and rhetoric. Muir's prose, by contrast, is a miracle of immediacy. His books, many of which were not published until very late in his life, have none of the elegiac and crepuscular quality of much memoir. They are illuminated by sunshine and starlight. The cold mineral air of the mountains and the resiny reek of coniferous forests lift bracingly off his pages. No other writer is so ceaselessly astonished by the natural world as Muir, or communicates that astonishment more urgently. Muir lived - as he put it in a typically lovely phrase - \"in an infinite storm of beauty\", and his readers live in it with him. </p> <p>In North America, Muir has achieved the status of prophet. He founded the Sierra Club, which now has more than 600,000 members and is the most formidable environmental pressure group in the States. So many peaks, lakes and glaciers have been named after Muir that the US Geological Survey has been obliged to issue a statement declaring that they would \"not be likely to approve any further such commemorations\". Three plants, a butterfly, a mineral have been christened in his honour, as well as, less appropriately, a touring musical, and the John Muir Parkway, a four-lane freeway in Martinez, California. </p> <p>Muir's reputation in Britain, the place of his birth - in Dunbar, Scotland, third child of a fiercely Presbyterian farmer and lay preacher - is less secure, and his influence less ubiquitous. There is, though, one key British organisation to which he has lent his name and his ethos. The John Muir Trust, which celebrates its 21st anniversary this year, is the foremost wild-land protection group in Britain. It owns and manages seven substantial areas in Scotland, including 3,000 acres of the remote Knoydart peninsula; 11,000 acres of Sandwood Bay, the great white strand near Cape Wrath in Sutherland and - perhaps most marvellously - a large portion of the Ben Nevis massif, which includes the mountain's highest summit. </p> <p>\"Wildness,\" wrote Muir, \"is a necessity; and mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.\" This was the insight he bequeathed to modernity: that a landscape might be valuable not in terms of the economic or agrarian resources it provides, but in terms - harder to measure, harder to prove - of its profound spiritual effect. In the words of one of Muir's disciples, the American novelist and essayist Wallace Stegner, we need \"wild country available to us, even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look in. For it can be a means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as creatures, a part of the geography of hope.\" </p> <p>nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;* * * </p> <p>Like all those who survive posterity's prolific deletions, Muir's life has the outline of a myth. At least the way he told it, he underwent a spiritual conversion at the hands of nature. In the course of a single remarkable summer, Muir was transformed from the son of a preacher to a child of nature. </p> <p>In 1849 the Muir family had moved from Scotland to Wisconsin in search of a new life. Trying to ripen farmland out of the Wisconsin earth was arduous work, and between the ages of 11 and 22, Muir laboured on the farm. The family rose early, worked all day, and went to sleep immediately after evening prayers. When he was 15, Muir was set the task of excavating a well in the sandstone rock on which the farm stood. For several months, every day except Sundays, Muir was lowered alone in a bucket, with a single candle for light, to continue the digging work. At a depth of 80ft, he passed out for lack of oxygen. The next morning his father lowered him to the bottom again. Not until he was 90ft down did he hit water. What would now make for a best-selling Pelzerish memoir would, perversely, make Muir into a loafer. The virtues of diligence, labour and \"time-hoarding\", which had been drubbed into him during his adolescence - what he came to call his \"old bondage days\" - would be radically unlearned during a summer of ecstatic idleness in the Californian mountains. </p> <p>In 1868, aged 29, Muir arrived in San Francisco. He found the city oppressive and, in a now legendary exchange, stopped a passer-by to inquire the nearest way out of town. \"'But where do you want to go?' asked the man to whom I had applied for this important information. 'To any place that is wild,' I said. 'Yosemite' was the answer.\" And so off Muir went to the Sierra Nevada, the range of mountains which spines central California, and out of which the Yosemite Valley was glacially gouged during the Pleistocene era. </p> <p>The following May, Muir took a job in the Sierra as a shepherd. He was to move a sheep flock \"gradually higher through the successive forest belts as the snow melted, stopping for a few weeks at the best places we came to.\" My First Summer in the Sierra (1911) is Muir's account of this time - exploring, sleeping out, botanising, climbing - and is without doubt his finest single work. Reading the book now, one is rushed back to those joyous first months, and to Muir's drastic reimagining of himself. Here is his journal entry for June 6: \"We are now in the mountains and they are in us ... making every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us. Our flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rocks, in the waves of the sun, - a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but immortal ...\" </p> <p>Muir's pronouns tell the whole story. \"I\" has become \"we\": the monad of the Presbyterian soul has dissolved into the plurality of the pantheist's. What we see at work here is \"sympathy\" in its strongest 19th-century form - not feeling sorry for someone or something, or even feeling like them, but actually being them. The distance of simile has been abolished; Muir has become the mountains, and they have become him. My First Summer teems with passages like this, where Muir's self melts into his environment. His experiences of rapture were close to the classical Greek concept of \"metempsychosis\" (the transmigration of the spirit) or, to give it its beautiful German name, Seelenwanderung : \"soul-wandering\". \"I'm breathing the granite again,\" reads a journal entry from July. \"The mtns. are getting back into my blood.\" In 1870, when he was first falling in love with the Californian forests, Muir wrote a letter to a friend. He put his address down as \"Squirrelville, Sequoia Co, Nut time\". \"I'm in the woods woods woods,\" the letter began, \"&amp; they are in me-ee-ee.\" </p> <p>Muir's collected writings, most of which are set in the Californian mountains, comprise the greatest canticle for the wild ever written. In Britain, few words can be more trusted to shrivel the sensitive reader's enthusiasm than \"nature writing\". They tend to evoke the bearded enthusiasms of an over-earnest brigade of curates and minor gentry, a lazy Edwardian attentiveness, a nookishly myopic interest in rock-pools and phyla. Muir's robust and invigorating visions show how narrow-minded this set of connotations is. </p> <p>Lyricism is a function of precision, and Muir was unforgettably precise when writing about landscape. He noted the \"heavy masonry\" of the Sierra range. He wrote of the \"wind-history of trees\": the ways the screws and gyres of trunks and branches archived prevailing weather patterns. He walked across \"a field of snow as trackless as the sky\" (an image which tellingly predates aviation). He exulted in \"the wild gala-day of the north wind\". He described squirrels in their pines, \"fiery, peppery, full of brag and fight and show, with movements so quick and keen they almost sting the onlooker\". He followed a \"fat, pollen-dusted\" bumble bee as it \"rumbled among the flowers\". </p> <p>The intrepidity of Muir's wild experience is also unforgettable. JG Ballard once speculated on the leisure activities of the future. They would include, he proposed, lava-rafting and avalanche-surfing. He should have read Muir who, 100 years earlier, was already inhabiting Ballard's near future. In 1873, Muir surfed his first avalanche: \"I was swished down to the foot of the ca\u00f1on as if by enchantment. The wallowing ascent had taken nearly all day, the descent only about a minute. When the avalanche started I threw myself on my back and spread my arms to try to keep from sinking. Fortunately, though the grade of the ca\u00f1on is very steep, it is not interrupted by precipices large enough to cause outbounding or free-plunging. On no part of the rush was I buried. I was only moderately imbedded on the surface or at times a little below it, and covered with a veil of back-streaming dust particles; and as the whole mass beneath and about me joined in the flight there was no friction, though I was tossed here and there and lurched from side to side. When the avalanche swedged and came to rest I found myself on top of the crumpled pile without bruise or scar. This was a fine experience ... This flight in what might be called a milky way of snow-stars was the most spiritual and exhilarating of all the modes of motion I have ever experienced! Elijah's flight in a chariot of fire could hardly have been more gloriously exciting!\" </p> <p>There is so much to admire here, whether it is the \"veil of back-streaming dust particles\", or \"milky way of snow-stars\". What might, in the hands of another writer, have become a raucously self-vaunting anecdote of a life nearly lost - the prose equivalent of slamming a drained beer glass down on a table - is for Muir an experience midway between scientific experiment and religious epiphany. </p> <p>Muir's books are filled with such moments of ecstatic transport. When an earthquake strikes the Yosemite Valley at night in March 1872, he is woken by the shaking: \"The strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, near the Sentinel Rock, both glad and frightened, shouting, 'A noble earthquake!' ... The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves, and it seemed impossible the high cliffs should escape being shattered.\" </p> <p>On another occasion, in a now notorious incident of brinkmanship, Muir tracked the Yosemite Creek to the edge of an escarpment, where it falls half a mile \"in showy foam to another world\". Keen to hear \"the death song\" of the creek in its plummet, Muir clambered down to a \"narrow shelf about three inches wide on the very brink, just wide enough for a rest for one's heels ledge\". From there, soaked by spray, he \"obtained a perfectly free view down into the heart of the snowy, chanting throng of comet-like streamers into which the body of the fall soon separates\". </p> <p>There is nothing lazy about Muir. Reading him, you feel invulnerable. He gives you seven-league boots. He climbs high mountains in a single paragraph. Rock-fall, blizzard and avalanche cannot harm him. Even his metabolism is superhuman - when he goes off to climb a big peak, he typically \"fastens a hard, durable crust to my belt by way of provision in case I should be compelled to pass a night on the mountain-top\". </p> <p>Those who seek to disparage Muir often dismiss him as an over-writer. And it is true that, where the melancholic WG Sebald can sometimes seem like the Eeyore of non-fiction, there are times when the ceaselessly joyful Muir sounds too much like Molesworth's nature-loving schoolboy peer, Fotherington-Thomas. \"Hello birds, hello trees! Nature alone is beautiful!\" cries Fotherington-Thomas. \"How fine the weather is!\" cries Muir. \"Nothing more celestial can I conceive! How gently the winds blow!\" </p> <p>It is no surprise, indeed, to learn that the exclamation mark was Muir's favourite form of punctuation. Forster once likened the use of exclamation marks to laughing at one's own jokes, but nothing so solipsistic is at work with Muir. For him, the exclamation mark was just a way of notating rapture. There was never any self-admiration involved in his writing. </p> <p>nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;* * * </p> <p> After that magical first summer, Muir stayed in the valley for six years, rarely leaving its precincts. He climbed and explored, walked many thousands of miles, discovered the first living glaciers ever found in the region, mapped the distribution of the giant redwoods, guided famous visitors - including Emerson and Roosevelt - around the region, and built up the formidable archive of natural experience which would issue into his prose. Towards the end of that time, too, he launched his writing career with a series of articles called \"Studies in the Sierra\". It was Muir's prose, mostly published as articles and essays, which would win him such a massive public following, and give him such powerful political leverage. </p> <p>During the last four decades of Muir's life, he merged his intuitive and abstract love of wilderness with a great facility for realpolitik. He learned the need to lobby for the preservation of the landscapes he loved. The two principal results of Muir's political activities - the Sierra Club and Yosemite National Park - are enduring achievements. </p> <p>Less immediately obvious, but perhaps more deeply influential, was the revolution of wilderness sensibility which Muir's prose incited. Muir introduced the concept of interconnectedness; that, in his words, \"as soon as we take one thing by itself, we find it hitched to everything in the universe\". This, he proved, was an aesthetic truth as much as an ecological one. Beauty, like nature, existed as a network and not a hierarchy. Muir also explained and energised a sense of the spiritual worth of wilderness. He asked the question not of what wild places can do for humanity, but what they can do to it. Muir's proclamations about the wilderness have a burry relevance to them - they become ever more insistently attached to our culture. \"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilised people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home,\" he wrote in 1901. </p> <p>Unlike so many eminent Victorians, who survive only as sepia print or guano-streaked statuary, Muir has grown in importance since his death. The American left in particular, in its huge battles with the Bush administrations over environmental use, has needed Muir this past 20 years. In a curious recent twist, Arnold Schwarzenegger, in an attempt to further green his regime, has commissioned Muir's face as the icon for the new California state quarter. Muir is needed in the UK, too. There is a false and dangerous amnesia at work concerning the very existence of wild places in these islands. False, because it is clear that the British Isles in fact still seethe with wildness and wilderness. And dangerous, because it licenses a laissez-faire attitude towards the wilderness which does remain; if we do not think it is there, we will not take care of it. I have said it before, but it cannot be said often enough: the natural world becomes far more easily disposable if it is not imaginatively known, and a failure to include it in a literary regard can slide easily into a failure to include it in a moral regard. </p> <p>And this is why Muir's fiercely immediate attention to the power of wildness to change us as humans - the power of outer landscapes to reshape for the better our inner landscapes - is so valuable and so political. Most people in Britain exist for most of the time in worlds which are humanly arranged, themed, and controlled. It is easy to forget that there are environments which do not respond to the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, and which have their own rhythms and orders of existence. Yet were Britain to bankrupt itself of wilderness - as it is perfectly capable of doing - the change in the country's mood and morale would be devastating. One thinks here of Auden's tersely brilliant observation that \"a culture is no better than its woods\". The preservation of wild places is as essential to Britain's geography of hope as urban regeneration, and John Muir is the finest geographer of hope we could ever wish for. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robert Macfarlane's Mountains of the Mind: A History of a Fascination (Granta) won the Guardian First Book award, 2003.

  "<p>When she was 17 and working six days a week at a lift-repair company, Grace Paley showed WH Auden some of her poems. She was taking a night class at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, where Auden was then teaching, and she was \"crazy\" about his work. They met in a nearby caf\u00e9, where he read through a handful of poems and then asked: \"But do you really use these words, Grace?\" Which words, she asked. \"Well, 'subaltern', for instance.\" Yes, she lied, sometimes. \"And 'trousers', not pants?\" Oh yeah, she said, we say trousers, too. Auden was friendly enough, even encouraging, but Paley went away feeling embarrassed. She had learned her her first lesson as a writer: don't imitate (they both knew she'd been trying to write \"in British\"); find your own voice; above all, be truthful. </p> <p>It was another 20 years before Paley was published; her first collection of short stories, The Little Disturbances of Man , appeared in 1959. In the meantime, she married, had two children, wrote 100 poems and worked on her writing voice, steering it away from Auden's England and rooting it more firmly in the Bronx where she grew up. Her poetry and prose, remarkablyconsistent through five decades of work, are tough and funny, exuberant and experimental, written to be read aloud. Above all, hers is the language of the women, men and children she grew up with - poor immigrants from the old world who were learning to get along in the new. </p> <p>If she has not published as much as she might have, it is only because, she has said, \"Art is too long and life is too short\". There have been three collections of short stories, published at intervals of 10 years or more, three volumes of poetry, and a book of essays, articles and lectures, Just As I Thought (1998). But at the same time, there has been a lot to distract her: husbands (two), children, students, the feminist movement of the 1960s and 70s, the Vietnam and Iraq wars. For the past 50 years she has been as committed to her political life as to her writing, and describes herself as \"somewhat of a combative pacifist and a cooperative anarchist\". </p> <p>The author Ali Smith, who cites Paley as a \"definite\" influence on her own short stories, believes that if she does not get the recognition she deserves outside America it is because \"she is about things that do not suit a high profile: the short form, the political everyday, the small survival (which is, actually, epic), the playful potential, the unsentimental hope. Like all great, great writers, she is uncategorisable. Her stories are specially compacted, primed to resonate, disconcert, and then force you, in a way that's somehow both gentle and extraordinarily tough, to be intelligent. They don't haunt; they preoccupy.\" </p> <p>For AS Byatt, who wrote introductions to two Virago editions of Paley's short stories: \"She is one of a kind. The only writer I ever compare her with is Alice Munro, who puts her stories together in the same way, crafting them from a mass of recollected and rearranged material into a form. But they are quite different. I do not think I have ever laughed so much over the joy of the inconsequential as I do listening to Grace in her writing. She reminds me also of my mother at her best, who told terrible stories deadpan, ironing out the awful and the banal into one string of story.\" </p> <p>Paley, now 81, lives in the village of Thetford in Vermont, a perfect piece of New England where everyone votes Democrat and recycles. The home she shares with her second husband Bob Nichols, a writer and former landscape architect, is a wooden house on a hill surrounded by silver birch forest. The living-room floor is stacked with poetry quarterlies, feminist and pacifist monthlies, and Paley's grandchildren's paintings. Nichols hammers away on a typewriter upstairs, while Paley, small and dressed in an oversized man's check shirt, makes soup in the kitchen. Earlier this year, she underwent radiation treatment for breast cancer and for some months was too weak to work; but she is now back at work, making frequent trips to New York and Washington DC, where she lectures and teaches creative writing. </p> <p>At 17, Paley never thought of herself as a writer. She had been writing poems since she was nine, but never imagined that what interested her might interest anyone else. Besides, she says, it was the 30s and her mind was on the Spanish civil war and the rise of fascism. \"I didn't give the future five minutes.\" To her parents' frustration, she dropped out of school at 15 with no real plan. \"I couldn't see myself doing anything, except hanging out, reading books, talking to people. I loved my two English classes and I wouldn't miss one for anything, but I was bad at math, stupid at economics. I just wanted to be on my own. At the same time I was crazy about children, and I wanted to run with the boys.\" </p> <p>She married at 19, in 1942. Her husband Jess was in the army, and for the first two years of their marriage they lived in army camps. She loved it; he hated it. Then he was posted overseas and for two years they saw very little of each other. After the war he trained as a film cameraman and the couple had two children, Nora and Daniel. (Nora is now a physiotherapist, and Daniel a schoolteacher.) Family life was hard work, and there was little time for writing. </p> <p>Then, when she was in her early 30s, Paley had what she calls \"the first of two small lucks\" as a writer. She caught a bad flu, which meant that the children had to be looked after between school and dinner for several weeks, but was well enough to sit at the kitchen table and write; in those weeks she completed two stories. Then, after the children came back, a third. The second \"small luck\" came some months later. Writing in the introduction to her Collected Stories (1994), Paley recalls: \"One dark day in our dark basement apartment, a father slumped in our fat chair, waiting to retrieve his two kids, my children's friends. Just before leaving with them, he looked at me. He said that his former wife, the mother of his children, had asked him to read my stories. I probably said, Oh you don't have to bother. But he did...\" The father, an editor at Doubleday, came back and said that if she wrote seven more stories like the three he'd read, he'd publish the book. </p> <p>When The Little Disturbances of Man came out in 1959, the New York Times welcomed \"a newcomer possessed of the comic vision\". Philip Roth went further, seeing in the collection an \"understanding of loneliness, lust, selfishness and fatigue that is splendidly comic and unladylike. Grace Paley has deep feelings, a wild imagination, and a style [of] toughness and bumpiness.\" Paley knew the stories were good - she had taken the trouble to write them \"as truthfully and beautifully as I could\" - but she didn't expect them to find an audience among writers and critics so readily. The Beats were big at the time, as was Henry Miller - male writing, which didn't spare a lot of thought for the daily concerns and experiences of poor immigrant women. </p> <p>As a collection, Little Disturbances is characterised by its great humour and energy. All life is here, and all life is speeded up: a couple might meet, marry and divorce in a sentence - and not, you feel, for rhetorical effect but because life moves that fast. Alternatively, a conversation might last 30 years. In \"The Pale Pink Roast\", a woman seduces her philandering ex-husband after meeting him in the park. When he realises that she has re-married, and that her husband is expected home any moment, he accuses her of seeking revenge. Honest to God, she says, I did it for love: \"'Love?' he asked. 'Really?' He smiled. In no time at all his cheerful face appeared at the door of the spring dusk. In the street among peaceable strangers he did a handstand. Then easy and imperious, in full control, he cartwheeled east into the source of night.\" </p> <p>But along with this sense of the abundance of human life, there is a recognition that it is these same things - love, lust, marriage, children - which trap us. In \"Two Short Sad Stories from a Long and Happy Life\", a mother begs her young son to go outside and play and so give her five minutes' peace, but the more she pleads, the tighter he clings. Giving in, she realises that this is what her love for him is - a kind of prison: \"I closed my eyes and leaned on his dark head. But the sun in its course emerged from among the water towers of downtown office buildings and suddenly shone white and bright on me. Then through the short fat fingers of my son, interred forever, like a black-and-white-barred king in Alcatraz, my heart lit up in stripes.\" </p> <p>Paley was born Grace Goodside in the Bronx. Her parents had emigrated to New York from Ukraine in 1905 (the family name, anglicised on arrival by immigration officials, was Gutzeit). In New York, Paley's mother, Manya, worked for a photograph retoucher, and her father, Zenya, a doctor, ran his own practice below their flat. In Russia, her parents had been committed anti-tsarists: her father had been imprisoned and sent into exile in Siberia, as had her mother. Paley's uncle, her father's brother, was killed at 17 for carrying the red banner of the working class at a demonstration (Paley recalls being told by her aunt never to carry a red flag at demonstrations). She grew up surrounded by Russian, Yiddish and American voices. </p> <p>Her mother died when she was 23, having been ill with cancer for more than 10 years. In an essay called \"Other Mothers\", Paley recalls overhearing adults talking about her mother's illness, agreeing that Grace should not be told. \"Thereafter,\" she writes, \"I devote myself to not having received that knowledge. I see that my mother gazes sadly at me, not reproachfully, but with an anxious look, as I wander among the other mothers, leaning on their knees, writing letters, making long phone calls. Then, for several years, we are afraid of each other. I fear her death. She is afraid for my life.\" </p> <p>The Goodsides were agnostic Jews, as were most of their neighbours. Paley remembers pitying a schoolfriend who wasn't Jewish, for being excluded from so much community and language. Later, she came to read Clarice Lispector, the Brazilian novelist, Isaac Babel, Kafka, Mordechai Richler, Carl Friedman, all of them Jewish, and realised that here were greater resonances than she found with American writers: she had been \"writing in Jewish\" all along. (Lispector's family, she discovered, had emigrated to Brazil from a village close to her parents' in Ukraine.) </p> <p>As a teenager in the late 30s she was only distantly aware of American anti-semitism. She recalls her mother sitting at the kitchen table reading a newspaper and saying to her father: \"Zenya, it's coming again.\" Today, she describes herself as a believer in diaspora and not nationhood - \"I was never a Zionist.\" </p> <p>She remembers her parents as tremendously brave, even heroic, though her mother was shy. They were socialists, but at the same time \"wildly anti-Russian. They loved the revolution but not what followed it\". Her mother was often embarrassed by what she saw as her daughter's refusal to conform: both parents were angry when she was suspended from school for signing a pledge against the second world war. \"In this country, they seemed to believe, education, once struggled for, came first - then socialism.\" </p> <p>She was a political child in a political family, but Paley says she became a committed activist around 1954, first within the anti-Vietnam war movement, and then the women's movement. There were marches and petitions and sit-ins, and in the 60s - Paley forgets which year - she spent six days in the Women's House of Detention in Greenwich, charged with civil disobedience at a military parade. (She had sat down in front of a horse.) Her cellmates, most of them prostitutes, were outraged that a five-foot-nothing housewife should be locked up for having political beliefs. But in an essay called \"Six Days: Some Remembering\", Paley writes that she only wished she had been allowed a pen and paper so she could write everything down. </p> <p>In 1969, she went to North Vietnam as part of an American delegation invited to accompany three PoWs home. The trip was a series of shocks: the Vietnamese delegates who said: \"It is not your per sonal fault, we know the great American people would not allow it if they had the power\" and quoted Whitman and Emerson at her; the American PoW who told her over dinner: \"Gosh Grace, to be truthful, I really liked bombing.\" </p> <p>In 1974, she made her first trip to Russia as a delegate to the World Peace Congress. It was an emotional visit - \"surrounded by the conversation of my childhood, three times a day in the dining room my bones nearly melted\" - but the Russian delegates were hostile to Paley's insistence that they issue a blanket condemnation of American foreign policy. They did not have the same access to information, they explained, or freedom of political expression. But in an essay about the trip, \"Conversations in Moscow\", Paley wondered what the First Amendment ever did for America: \"It has been pleasing to stand on the corner of Eighth Street and Sixth Avenue and hand out informational pamphlets, leaflets of protest, to assemble in rage a couple of times a year with tens of thousands of others. The elected or appointed leaders of our country have often applauded our enactment of these freedoms. They were then able (with clear consciences) to undertake and sustain the awful wars we spoke and assembled against for 10 years.\" </p> <p>Throughout the 50s and 60s, Paley was also trying to raise a family and write a second volume of short stories. Her publisher wanted a novel, and for two years she tried and failed to write one. \"It was so pedestrian,\" she says. \"I mean, it was OK, but there were so many things I couldn't figure out.\" She finds the idea of plot difficult. In the story, \"A Conversation with My Father\" (1974), the narrator argues against \"plot, the absolute line between two points which I've always despised. Not for literary reasons, but because it takes all hope away. Everyone, real or invented, deserves the open destiny of life.\" </p> <p>The author AM Homes, a former student of Paley's at Sarah Lawrence college, says, \"Grace is simply not a novelist. Not everyone is, and we're crazy to value the one over the other. Do we get mad at poets for not producing novels? Like Ray Carver, her work is so finely tuned it would be impossible to push into novel form.\" </p> <p>By the late 60s, Paley's marriage was over, although she says now she can't remember why. \"My husband was really a very nice guy.\" When they separated she remembers saying to a friend: \"'Mary, what was I so mad about?' and she said, 'Sit down Grace and let me tell you.' But even now I forget.\" Although it was not a factor in their break-up, he was less enthusiastic about children, and Paley has written about the (then illegal) abortion she had when her two children were small - mainly because she was exhausted, but also because children were \"very low on his list of priorities. He was just beginning his career.\" The abortion was \"a very clean and decent affair\" at a doctor's office in Manhattan, and Jess went with her. The doctor was arrested within the year and went to jail. Two years later she became pregnant again: this time she wanted the child. and Jess didn't. \"It was very hard; I didn't know what to do. I was kind of in despair.\" No doctor would perform an abortion. Then, in her second trimester, she bled for four days and finally found a doctor who was prepared to help her. In the late 60s, Paley helped organise one of the first \"abortion speak-outs\" in New York and has always been frank about her own experience. </p> <p>In 1972, she married Robert Nichols, whom she had met through the Greenwich Peace Center. Two years later she published her second collection of stories, Enormous Changes at the Last Minute . Again, they were dense, funny, passionate - and this time, more explicitly political. Faith, the single mother Paley created in the 50s and who is often - Paley says mistakenly - taken for an alter-ego, was back, along with her two sons, Richard and Tonto. But there was more war, more disturbing news from beyond the domestic sphere. In the story \"Faith in a Tree\", a group of mothers and children sit talking in the park when a Vietnam war protest comes by, carrying placards showing photographs of napalmed babies. In \"Samuel\", one of two stories based on real events, a boy dies on the subway, falling between carriages after someone pulls the emergency chord. In \"The Little Girl\", the most shocking of Paley's stories, a man narrates how a friend rapes and beats a 14-year-old girl in his room; afterwards she either jumps or is thrown down an air shaft and left to die. The story is also true, and was told to Paley by the narrator, a friend she met through the Southern Conference for Human Welfare in the 50s. \"There were a lot of runaways then,\" she says, \"and sometimes he would bring these girls to me and say, 'Put some sense in her head'.\" It is the one story she will never read aloud: \"I was driven to write it, but there are enough hard stories out there.\" </p> <p>Not everyone welcomed the new seriousness in Paley's work: the New York Times critic saw signs of \"carpentry\" in the stories, particularly the shorter ones, and blamed the \"change in American life between the 1950s and 1960s\". The 60s had been a noisy decade, he wrote, a time for action rather than the imagination, which did not suit \"socially committed artists like Mrs Paley\". </p> <p>But this distinction has always been a bogus one for Paley. \"The domestic and the political are the same thing for her,\" says Smith. \"The political is also domestic, part of the everyday work.\" This is not to say that the pull of one is not sometimes greater than the other. In the short story \"Midrash on Happiness\", Faith sets out the following conditions for happiness: \"She meant having (or having had) (or continuing to have) everything. By everything she meant, first, the children, then a dear person to live with, preferably a man, but not necessarily.\" She wants close women friends, long walks and intimate talks, a political life, work, food on the table, to be in love - \"the acuteness of the heart at the sudden sight of a particular person\". When her friend Ruth reminds her that the world is full of \"boom-boom bellicosity\" and no revolution, she says: \"I know all that. I do, but sometimes walking with a friend I forget the world.\" </p> <p>Paley's feminism grew out of her own experiences as a wife and mother. To start with, there was the fearlessness she learned from her grandmother, mother and older sister. But it wasn't until she had children that she really began to live among, and write about, women. \"I was pained by the peculiar life of the women my age - in their 20s and 30s,\" she writes in Just As I Thought , \"a lot of them with kids and a lot of them alone already, objects of considerable contempt but kind of tough, ironic, becoming angry; I'd begun to educate myself without knowing it.\" In an untitled poem from the 80s she sends up this dichotomy between the lives of men and women:</p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The women let the tide go out<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which will return <br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which will return<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the sand, the salt, the fat drowned babies<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The men ran furiously<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;along the banks of the estuary<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;screaming<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Come back you fucking sea<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;right now<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;right now </p> <p>Paley has been criticised by some feminists for putting motherhood, what she calls \"the mommy-and-daddy business\", so squarely at the centre of her work and world view. Reviewing Just As I Thought in the New York Times, the critic Ellen Willis argued that \"this brand of feminism - and humanism - works better as literature than politics; I don't believe that by virtue of our child-bearing capacity we have a special responsibility for children, a special talent for nurturance, a special connection with the earth or a special penchant for non-violence.\" Paley would counter that she writes from her own experience and is not making a universal case. She also reserves the right to change her mind, and says now that the importance society places on fatherhood is one of the great advances of our age. \"Fathers are more mothering these days, which is a wonderful thing,\" she says. \"They can enjoy their children, they are not so burdened by the responsibility.\" Homes says, \"She is the best kind of feminist - she loves men. And that's a wonderful example of how to believe in women, to support them, and to make a wonderful, happy life with a man.\" </p> <p>Paley published her third collection of short stories, Later the Same Day, in 1985. Faith is here again, although older and tougher, fighting battles with her father in his retirement home, and with her teenage sons, who have grown up cynical. The collection is funny, but also full of non-specific anxiety: how do you protect those you love, how do you keep the young from the more horrible truths, from \"falling onto the hard floor of man-made time\", how do you bear the death of friends? </p> <p>The exuberance of Paley's early work is countered by a greater sense of the responsibilities of life, and of the writer. In \"The Story Hearer\", she writes: \"I am stuck here among my own ripples and tides. Don't you wish you could rise powerfully above your time and name? I'm sure we all try, but here we are, always slipping and falling down into them, speaking their narrow language, though the subject, which is how to save the world - and quickly - is immense.\" </p> <p>For the past 20 years much of Paley's time has been taken up with lecturing and teaching. As a teacher she says her aim is to keep her students \"dumb\", to encourage them to write about those things they understand the least. Homes remembers taking Paley a draft of her story \"Looking for Johnny\" from The Safety of Objects . \"I couldn't figure out how it should end - a tale of a kidnapped boy. Grace read it, pushed it back across the table and said, 'Well obviously the kidnapper brings him back - he's not the right kid.' It was brilliant and dead on - she's not afraid to give her ideas, thoughts; she taught me to keep working on a story until I got it right.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year Paley was too ill to work, but now her desk is covered in drafts and notes; there is a poem about her mastectomy and on the wall a note: FOR THE NIGHT COMETH WHEN NO MAN CAN WORK. There is much about getting older that depresses her, she admits: she will never know how people will grow up or how certain world events will play out. She is perhaps less optimistic about life and human nature than she once was, although she has been encouraged by the scale of protest against the war in Iraq. </p> <p>When Paley was made New York State's first official author in 1986, Raymond Carver was on the selection panel. She is a great admirer of his work, but points to an important difference between them. \"I sometimes think he doesn't give his characters a chance. The stories cut off too soon and you feel that if he had given them one more day things might have turned out alright.\" She has tried to give her characters that extra day, that last chance. \"Her stories give out such a sense of formal hope, potential, openness and dialogue,\" says Smith. She has worked to spread the good news and to complain, loudly, about the bad.</p> <p><strong> Grace Paley Born: </strong> December 11 1922, New York. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> 1938-39 Hunter College, New York,'39 New York University. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1942-1970 Jess Paley (one son, Daniel, one daughter, Nora); 1972 Robert Nicholls. </p> <p><strong> Career: 1966-88</strong> Sarah Lawrence College; also Syracuse and Columbia universities, and City college, New York. </p> <p><strong> Some books:</strong> 1959 The Little Disturbances of Man; '74 Enormous Changes at the Last Minute; '85 Later the Same Day; '91 Long Walks and Intimate Talks; '92 New and Selected Poems; '93 Begin Again: Collected Poems; '94 The Collected Stories; '98 Just As I Thought. </p> <p><strong> Some awards: </strong> 1961 Guggenheim fellowship; '70 National Institute of Arts and Letters Award for short story writing; '80 Elected to National Academy of Arts and Letters; '89-91 First New York State author.</p>",
  "Nick Broomfield, the documentary maker whose last film, Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer (2003), had a forceful impact on the US death penalty debate, is to make the first film about Chinese migrant workers in Britain. <p>He has been working on a drama to raise awareness of the migrants and expose the gangmaster system that lay behind the death of the 21 Chinese cockle pickers who were drowned in Morecambe Bay in February when they were trapped by the incoming tide.</p> <p>The working title is Ghosts (in Mandarin Gweilo ) a heavily charged term which many Chinese began to use for westerners in response to opening of their country after the opium wars.</p> <p>It is still used by Chinese people in Britain, who see themselves as culturally distinct, and has come to mean \"foreigners\" in general parlance.</p> <p>Broomfield recognises that the socially isolated Chinese, particularly the new migrant workers, are the gweilos in British society, leading a hidden, ghost-like existence.</p> <p>The players will be workers portraying themselves, speaking Mandarin or other dialects. The main woman is an undocumented worker from Henan province, central China, who was employed as a chef for the cockle pickers.</p> <p>One of the main men is from Fujian and relates his month being smuggled across Asia and Europe to Britain.</p> <p>\"Meeting and talking with the cockle pickers living in Liverpool is an eye-opener to me,\" Broomfield says. \"What struck me most is the dignity of the people living and working in such conditions.

  "<p>Beeban Kidron is a one-woman brass band - all eyebrows and fiery gestures and sudden changes in tempo and delivery. Italics don't even begin to do justice to her emphases, her passion. Everything she says is delivered with more than conviction, with complete credibility. When I say brass band, I don't mean noisy - she isn't - I just mean that she is the kind of person you'd follow into combat, or down a mine.</p> <p>And that's one of a whole load of reasons that you wouldn't expect Kidron to have directed the second Bridget Jones movie, The Edge Of Reason. From the closing credits of the original, the sequel seemed all stitched up. With the cast assembled, the director a buddy of the writer, the writer a global success story, and blockbuster status for all of them, you'd think they'd just roll up their sleeves and start over again. Instead, they drafted in a director with the most flawless feminist pedigree, along with a history of political activism both inside film- making and out. </p> <p>Besides wondering what made them choose Kidron, more to the point is what made her choose them? Well, she has this pitch of persuasiveness that seems as if it comes from spending a working life trying to persuade people to part with 20 quid to make something that sounds unwatchable but is actually brilliant. What do you do with all that spare charisma when there's more money than you could shake a stick at and the film is so eagerly awaited that it probably doesn't even need adverts? This sounds as if I'm accusing Kidron of selling out, which I'm not, but if I were, she has rather a wry and unarguable answer to that one: \"From the moment I went to Hollywood for the first time, I was accused by various people of selling out. So I feel I've done my sell-out films already. I've sold everything! I've sold every piece of soul I ever had!\" </p> <p>Kidron's filmography is surprisingly short, considering how recognisable her name is - you always expect a director (or an actor, or anyone involved in the business, really) to have done two films, to every one you've heard of, that were forgettable, or rubbish, or straight-to-video. Kidron has, mostly, only done ones you remember: Carry Greenham Home, the documentary she made with Amanda Richardson about the women's peace camp at Greenham Common, which she began when she was 20; Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, the television adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's novel that swept the Baftas of 1991; Vroom, the above-average Brit flick that featured breakthrough performances by David Thewlis and Clive Owen; Antonia And Jane, the female buddy movie starring Imelda Staunton and Saskia Reeves; Hookers Hustlers Pimps And Their Johns, a startling documentary with a self-explanatory title; and Murder, the 2002 TV drama starring Julie Walters. Indeed, the only spider in the ice cream is the disappointing Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert clone To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar, in which she got Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes into frocks. </p> <p>And that's pretty much it. Kidron nods vigorously, mercifully unoffended by what is essentially a really rude question. \"Yes, I wish I'd made more films. I wish it was easier to make films I'm interested in. My taste is very, very broad, but the quality, I'm only interested in a certain level of quality. And Bridget is part of that, for me. I think you can sort of look at this slightly odd CV that I have and see where Bridget fits in. It's been the Antonia [And] Jane, To Wong Foo strand, the more comedic of my work. I think it is a great gift to make people laugh, and it shouldn't be underestimated. I mean, I don't mean my great gift [laugh, eyes, fireworks], I mean a great gift in the community.\" </p> <p>Bridget is a very funny film. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who has been billed since Nurse Irene as the comic actress of her generation, does more than flex her comedy muscles. Here, she flexes them, and then picks up a huge big truck. You could say that about the first one, too, but there's more meat to her this time (no, no, I don't mean the weight-gain thing; the scale of weight-gain has remained the same). Hugh Grant, given more of an unambiguous bad guy role, is able to do comic malevolence in a way that few directors allow him, since they never want to waste his peerless romantic hero shtick. The smaller roles are way more carefully tended, and laugh-out-loud jokes are slipped in at the end of scenes, rather than announced with a big fanfare - this film has enough funny gags that it can sprinkle them about like hundreds and thousands. </p> <p>Kidron is naturally keen to give all the credit to Helen Fielding, Zellweger (\"She's actually a thoroughbred actress, is what she is\") and Grant. She goes so far as to have a bit of a moment over Colin Firth: \"I've walked down the street with Madonna, and I've walked down the street with Colin Firth, and it was a little bit more ... with Madonna they were a little rougher, but they were all there for Colin. It was amazing. Women adore him. They swoon. Anyway. Stop. If I say anything stupid, you have to cut it out.\" </p> <p>But aside from how well the others did their jobs, it's clear she did hers so well because she attacked it with absolute fervour. This wasn't a film taken on by someone who needed a new bathroom - put it that way. Kidron isn't a trainspottery Bridget Jones aficionado - she makes no claims to being the first to discover how funny it was, or being able to quote whole chapters of the oeuvre, but equally there's no part of her that feels as if she's ... not dumbing down, exactly, more unfeministing-down (can I get away with that?) in having taken on the project. \"I remember when the first one came out, and this guy on the telly attacked the movie on really pseudo-feminist grounds, you know, that it makes women stupid, it saw them only in relation to their men. I remember turning on him and saying, 'You're wrong. You're wrong. No one thinks of Laurel and Hardy as stupid, or Buster Keaton as denigrated. It is a metaphor for how we feel, it's a realisation of our fear of how we're going to behave.'\" </p> <p>She makes no outlandish claims for the importance of this film, but does insist that, in its way, it is radical. It's radical because its heroine isn't perfect, she isn't graceful, she isn't chaste or even particularly monogamous, and she isn't thin. That last is what everyone fixes on, but the rest is, in the context of what is expected of female leads by mainstream Hollywood and so many other branches of the media aimed at women, just as important. \"Now, I don't say it's broadly radical, and I absolutely can see how you could put it in a cultural context and say it is shoring up a number of things, heterosexual, blah, but you know what? The world is so far gone, and women are under such a lot of pressure ... You have a choice in the mainstream media of saying a little thing to a lot of people, or a great many things to many fewer people. It is very, very rare that you can do both.\" </p> <p>Kidron views it not with derision but with amused bafflement. \"I had breakfast with one of my more intellectual friends - I mean, properly intellectual, a very, very famous man in the world. I was in the middle of shooting, one day off, and he said, 'And how is she doing? I hear she ate 13 doughnuts in one day.' I was absolutely stunned. And I went, 'Antony Gormley O ... B ... E! I cannot believe you are concerning yourself with what Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has for breakfast!' I was flabbergasted.\" </p> <p>You'd think, with a sequel, that people would get bored with such a surface detail, but no - everyone still talks about Zellweger's phenomenal eatathon as though she'd been forced to give away a kidney for the sake of her art. I suppose this reinforces Kidron's point that, at this particular time in the trajectory of images of femininity, a message as simple as \"It's OK not to be skinny\" is radical, and will continue to be, until more people make it, and more often. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it's probably still not the film Kidron thought she'd be making 20-ish years ago when her first film, Carry Greenham Home, came out. She was still at film school when she made it - indeed, had just gone along for the weekend to try and figure out how to use a camera and ended up staying a year. \"Literally, night and day, night and day. I had my 21st birthday at Greenham, by the fire, chanting. It was one of my better birthdays. And I think I had a New Year's Eve going over the perimeter fence. It was one of my better New Year's Eves.\" </p> <p>Kidron is uncharacteristically not-that-modest about this venture, which I think is because it's so long ago that she sees it as part of the time, rather than part of her work: \"It was a huge, huge act of protest and politics and rage at what was going on in the world. But it was still funny, it was still touching, it was still a version of a documentary, and that's always been my interest. How do you speak to the many? And how are you - not in a compromising sense, but in the most positive possible sense - the acceptable face of what they do not understand or will not tolerate?\" </p> <p>Having said that, she doesn't hold much with self-effacement, certainly not the half-meant, simpering kind, and I think it would be impossible to have been politicised in the era that she was, without winding up way too bolshie and full of vim to affect a \"don't mind me\" stance about anything. Besides which, it is a brilliant documentary, vivid and funny and sincere to a degree that is actually a bit depressing, since it reminds you that the most you ever see about important protests now is when Ali G goes down to take the piss out of them and ask why they don't have more baths. It reminds you, also, how polarised people used to be about things like this, how a great many people saw nothing at all worthwhile, or worth listening to, about peace protesters, and normal-looking Greenham locals went round with angry faces and badges saying RAGE (Residents Against Greenham ... I can't remember what the E stood for. Maybe eejits). </p> <p>As distinct, easily, were the battle lines drawn around Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit. It's easy to forget the context of this, along with the reaction it drew. Plus, the tragic early death of its lead actress Charlotte Coleman bathes it in nostalgia, rather, and puts it on a cultural par with the children's television series Marmalade - something of which everyone was immediately fond, and remains so. </p> <p>But this was a time when there were only four channels, and everyone was watching one of them, and the only way to opt out of cultural debate would be not to watch telly at all (whereas now you can just watch Friends all the time). It was also long before the first lesbian kiss on Brookside, before gayness was even a twinkle in the eye of EastEnders, and a good 10 years before Coronation Street caught up. The first scene of same-sex intimacy on British television is what gave it its shock value, and Mary Whitehouse wasn't alone in her crazy talk of depravity. The BBC wasn't too keen on it, either. \"I remember that when the executive producer, I can't remember his name, Michael something ... but not Grade [eyes flash with prospect of amusing identity mistake]. Definitely not Grade. But anyway, he stood up, and he said, 'Well, that's not very BBC, is it?' And he walked out, and that was his contribution.\" </p> <p>It was phenomenally successful in the mainstream, with all the Baftas and such, and also won every gay and lesbian film-making award going, but Kidron's standing as a resolutely radical and campaigning director, on this front, is complicated. To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar, starring all those quintessentially straight big shots, garnered some serious-minded critiques for not going far enough, not using any gay actors, not showing the reality of being a transvestite in small-town America, all those boxes it would have ticked if its aim had been exclusively political. </p> <p>As is probably clear by now, Kidron would rather be somewhat political and somewhat mainstream than very political and not mainstream at all. She talks about films \"doing their job in the world\". When she pantomimishly claimed to have sold every bit of soul she had, it was underpinned by a more serious rejection of the academic/arthouse path through culture, which guards its purity very closely but doesn't reach an awfully large audience. \"All these things are cultural conversations. You want to be part of it, you don't want to leave it to everyone else. 'Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I'm doing something terribly right on.' I'm not that interested in that. I think we have a broader palette.\" </p> <p>In terms of her personal politics, she says she's the kind of person who seems terribly political to the outside world, but who, in the context of her Marxist upbringing, isn't political at all. She isn't the same creature, politically, as the one who made Carry Greenham Home. \"The world has changed so much. And my relationship with it has changed so much. I'm older, and I'm a mother, and I've been through many and various life experiences. I lost my father. I'm even married, which I never thought I would be. There are many, many things that have changed my relationship with the world.\" </p> <p>And, for half a second, that all sounds like a roundabout way of saying that hoary old Churchill thing about being a socialist until you're 30 because you've a heart, and a conservative afterwards because you've a brain. But, of course, that's not what she's saying at all. \"I've been very encouraged by the numbers of young people gathering around the anti-globalisation thing. It's not all thought through, but it's pretty anarchic and it's pretty fantastic and it's pretty loud. And the huge movement against the war, which, of course, should have been heeded, and which, of course, Blair is a criminal to have turned his back on, is also encouraging because, in this time in which we lack community and lack a structure and lack a political education, here is the largest street demonstration in history. So you've always got to look to the facts ... there are very stupid movies, with very stupid women in them, but there are also very intelligent movies, with very intelligent women in them. There is despair about international politics and a despair about domestic politics, but there is a proper, vibrant opposition, and it's not around traditional party lines.\" </p> <p>I love the way women in films keep bobbing back up as she talks, regardless of the subject; it's a million miles away from the crass, keep-plugging-the-product stuff you get sometimes when you try to draw a filmy person away from the film. A project can consume terribly energetic, terribly passionate people to the extent that all conversations dovetail with it, at least for a time. Kidron had Bridget Jones absolutely right - it is not the most groundbreaking film ever made, but it breaks enough ground, and it's all done so expertly and charmingly you wouldn't want it to go further. </p> <p>\"So long as I haven't dropped the crown jewels, so long as people think that their Bridget is safe, so long as people know it's still OK to have a big arse and say the wrong thing and not be able to live up to this or that - all these expectations of what being a woman is - and they will still find romance and love and happiness, and all the things you want in a good life, then I've done my job.

  "When you are down on your luck, it may be the last thing on your mind. <p>But in Austria doctors know the health value of a good chortle, and are offering homeless people lectures on how to laugh.</p> <p>The project began in the southern city of Graz earlier this month, and has been such a success that other disadvantaged groups, including asylum seekers, about to be taken on as students.</p> <p>The courses are conducted by professors such as Leopold Neuhold from the Karl Franzens University in Graz, who has been to four local hostels to deliver a lecture called \"laughter is the best medicine\".</p> <p>\"This is a fantastic project,\" he said.\" One of the main problems for the homeless is getting a foot back in the door of society ... we hope this programme will be the first step towards achieving that goal.\"</p> <p>The project is sponsored by the Austrian equivalent of the Big Issue magazine, called Megaphon.</p> <p>Dr Neohold said his first 30 homeless students had learned the importance of humour in the face of adversity, and added: \"It demonstrates that education should be open to everyone, including the homeless.</p> <p>\"Anyone who completes a course will be given a certificate, and I'm sure it will give them back a degree of respect.\"</p> <p>Graz University has conducted pioneering research into how laughter strengthens the immune system and builds confidence.</p> <p>The Berlin University laughter expert Professor Gunther Sickl said: \"Phrases such as laughing yourself sick should actually be turned around to read laughing yourself well.</p> <p>\"Up to 80 muscles are used to have a really good laugh. And he body gets a very healthy work-out. It is such good exercise that it sometimes even leads to cramps for those having their first good belly-laugh in a while.</p> <p>\"The heart beats faster, blood pressure rises and oxygen levels in the blood increase as breathing accelerates.</p> <p>\"And possibly most important of all, endorphins, the brain drugs, are released - they not only promote a feeling of well-being but are seen by most doctors as the best natural drugs of all. After the laughing has stopped, the blood pressure falls again and stress hormones are reduced, increasing the strength of the immune system.\"</p> <p>The homeless are not the first to benefit from the laughter lectures.</p> <p>Many places in Germany and Austria have special laughter clubs where the forgotten art of laughter is taught using techniques ranging from laughter exercises to joke telling.</p> <p>Laughter holidays are also offered.</p> <p>A hotel owner, Franz Pirktl, 55, said: \"As a health and fitness hotel we used to cater just for people's physical well-being.</p> <p>\"But the amount of money that people in Germany have been spending on laughter clubs and courses has shown there is a market for improving people's sense of fun.

  "Today Kim Wilde counts a 16th century Hertfordshire barn as her work space. \"As soon as I stepped in I knew that I'd found a spot that I wouldn't want to leave. It was a natural barn and it was full of straw with shafts of light coming through. It had never been lived in. <p>\"It was utterly gorgeous and I totally fell in love with it. I didn't know I was going to get into gardening, but I did have this sense that I wanted to work from home and that my music career would change dramatically and that I'd need to find another string to my bow.\" </p> <p>A decade of pop concerts was followed by marriage to actor Hal Fowler. </p> <p>The couple have two children, Harry and Rose. \"I had such an interesting career and I got to travel around the world and everything was really quite fantastic but I was itching to settle down.\" </p> <p>It wasn't until they started to plan a garden that she fell in love with planting. \"It was a blank canvas out here. I basically stood at the kitchen door and took these panoramic photographs of the whole of the place. </p> <p>\"I had a sense of capturing that moment because there was part of me that knew that something was going to happen for me and that it was going to be outside. </p> <p>\"I went to Capel Manor College in north London for a few weeks and had a born again Christian experience. I found horticulture in a big way; there were fantastic tutors there and I never wanted to leave the class.\" </p> <p>She thinks that the seeds were sown when her family moved when she was eight from London to Hertfordshire. \"It was the impact of being a south east London girl and then suddenly being here in Hertfordshire. We could just step outside the door and be in the forest.\" After her course she knew she'd found a path to go down wholeheartedly. TV show Better Gardens did some research at Capel Manor and naturally the tutors were keen to tell them who had just done a course in design and planting. </p> <p>\"I somehow managed to bluff my way through, just on passion alone. I had a great willingness to throw myself in at the deep end but I was skating on very thin ice. The alternative was to run away but I couldn't do that. It was the steepest learning curve I've ever been on.\" </p> <p>Garden Invaders followed. \"At the end of all the TV stuff I took myself back to college for two years to do an evening class.\" She's currently working on a children's gardening book, due to be published next year, and she has also submitted a design to Chelsea for a romantic Cumbrian garden. </p> <p>At home she's creating a sensory garden with her children and every year she plants more saplings for her woodland. Now her home has become her work space, going on stage, she says, feels very different. \"Horticulture is the career and the pop stuff is the hobby,\" she says. But she still gets excited about going on stage. \"It starts as soon as I get up, and then as soon as I get in a car to go to the gig, it goes up another notch.\" </p> <p>The transformation from being a mother and gardener to an eighties rock chick, happens when she puts on her make up. \"And the final thing I always do is to put on this big black ring that is very Alvin Stardust.

  "<p><strong>Credit cards:</strong> Using a credit card can be like eating a family-size bar of chocolate all by yourself - exhilarating while it lasts, depressing when it's finished and the guilt sets in. All those bills to pay, or else the pain of outrageous interest rates and that nagging feeling that maybe you didn't need those new shoes, after all.</p> <p>So it is with mixed feelings that I write about affinity cards - credit cards that make a donation to an organisation of your choice every time you use them. The organisation can be a charity or a special interest group such as a football club (although the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea, both with affinity schemes, are hardly needy). </p> <p>The big affinity card suppliers include <strong>HSBC </strong>, <strong>MBNA</strong> and the <strong>Halifax Bank Of Scotland</strong> conglomerate. An affinity card from the <strong>Co-op</strong> gives the feel-good bonus of its ethical stance. Co-op's affinity partners include Amnesty, Barnados, Help The Aged and WaterAid; its Greenpeace card, based on the plastic PETG, is more environmentally friendly than the standard PVC card. </p> <p>For a list of what's out there, and what each card offers, visit Bradford &amp; Bingley's financial advice website, <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.co.uk\">marketplace.co.uk</a>. Another website, <a href=\"http://www.charitychoice.co.uk\">charitychoice.co.uk</a>, might help you decide who is going to benefit from your largesse. Or you could contact a favourite charity direct: most have some kind of scheme </p> <p>Typically, the rewards for charities are between \u00a310 and \u00a325 when you sign up and around 0.25% on every purchase. That might sound like small beer but it does add up. Take the <strong>RSPB</strong>, which has one of the largest number of subscribers (100,000). Since it launched the UK's first affinity Visa in 1989, the charity has received a \u00a35.5m cut of what its supporters spend in the shops. And one of its portfolio of four cards offers a competitive 8.9% fixed rate APR. </p> <p>It all sounds so perfect: capitalism and conscience working in harmony. But affinity cards, according to experts, are rotten value. Earlier this year, a survey by financial analyst <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com\">moneysupermarket.com</a> found that, on average, a mere 25p in every \u00a3100 spent went to charity, while \"sign up\" donations were as little as \u00a34. \"The bottom line is, the amount of money a card will give to charity tends to be low,\" says Mike Naylor, principal researcher for Which! magazine. \"And you should only consider it if you pay off your bill every month, because they don't tend to offer a very competitive rate of interest.\" </p> <p>Michael Senior, head of personal lending at Bradford &amp; Bingley, suggests an alternative. At the time of writing, the best buy for credit cards at marketplace.com was <strong>Sainsbury's</strong>, offering 0% interest on balance transfers for 12 months. If you want to give to a particular charity, says Senior, why not move to the best-value card: \"If I move my card to Sainsbury's, I might save, say, \u00a3100, then I can give that to a charity that might only get \u00a325 on an affinity card.\" </p> <p>But this relies on us remembering to pay the charity, and besides, there are more efficient ways to donate to good causes. <strong>The Charities Aid Foundation</strong>, an umbrella organisation that exists to increase charities' resources, suggests a <strong>charity account</strong> - a tax-exempt scheme whereby every \u00a3100 you pay gets topped up by at least \u00a328 from the government. You can then write cheques to a charity of your choice, or donate using your card, in the same way you pay for goods on the phone or internet. It's completely different from an affinity scheme. But you still get to carry that bit of plastic.</p>",
  "<p>Payment is to capitalism what sex is to evolution: they're both the vital moments of exchange and, interestingly, moments of extreme pleasure. With sex, there is the moment of orgasm; with payment, there is the moment you get your carrier bag. </p> <p>When paying, you can give the exact money or a big note. Fiddling around with change implies that you've scrimped and saved for your newspaper; giving a big note implies that you've just been paid. Some people insist on giving a big note together with some change, so the shopkeeper will give them \u00a31 coins back. Newsagents hate people like this, and often remove the magazine from the paper to stop them being so smug. </p> <p>Shopkeepers hate change. It's heavy, dirty, and an average newsagent lifts a total of three tonnes of it every day. That's why they don't like getting your change and they don't like giving their change. The only thing they like is tuppences, because they never bother getting these from the bank. </p> <p>Lots of prices end in 99p, but buy two of these items and they're stuffed. Always check your change while your hand's still out: 99 times out of 100, you'll get the right change, but it's worth spending a few minutes checking for 20p pieces from Guernsey, which are that island's largest export. </p> <p>The difference between a debit and a credit card is that a debit card spends money you haven't got now and a credit card spends money you haven't got later. The good thing about paying by card is that you pay to the exact penny and don't need to carry a pocketful of change. The bad news is that you'll never be able to park again. </p> <p>The lighter money is, the more likely you are to spend it. In the old days, a penny was the size of a baby's head and weighed as much as a small piano. It was not, therefore, something you frittered away on sweets. A credit card weighs less than an ice cream wafer, and is correspondingly easy to waft about. </p> <p>Barcodes are the DNA of non-living things. Instead of you and the shopkeeper happily reading the price together, your item is snatched from you and scanned. Then you both look at the little read-out on the till that says, \"Water, \u00a31.80.\" If these displays were linked to the Highways Agency, they would read Tiredness Can Kill, Take A Break. You could then go to a coffee shop and have your muffin scanned.</p>",

And why [hushed tones] both sides don't want to take it any further!</p> <p>It all seemed to make sense - until today, when Manchester United announced they were forwarding an explosive dossier to the FA. \"We have launched our own investigation into Arsenal,\" Ferguson deep-throated. \"There are a lot of statements being made by witnesses.\" Apparently United's dossier will include what their innuendo-oblivious spokesman calls a 'Tape of Tackles', highlighting the Gunners' various indiscretions. \"I am very disappointed at the comments from the Arsenal camp,\" added Fergie, who's still angry about Arsene Wenger's tunnel bust-up denials (not to mention his dry-cleaning bill).</p> <p>If Fergie's investigation was designed to make Wenger sweat like Lisa Riley on her way to the corner shop, it clearly failed. For, not a half-hour later, the Arsenal boss sauntered into a press room and said he welcomed United's dossier! \"That's exactly what they should do,\" he smiled. \"The FA can look into what they want, I don't mind. I am not worried at all, I didn't see any pizza, nothing happened.\" The Arsenal boss then insisted he had no problem with Ruud \"he can only cheat people\" van Nistelrooy.

  "Peter Marx, one of the leaders of the National Democratic party of Germany (NPD), makes no bones about it: his neo-Nazi party's surprise success in the September 19 regional elections in Saxony was no mere fluke. It was planned like a military operation: the party defined its goals, studied the terrain, drew up a plan of action and drummed up the resources. <p>As a result, for the first time in its history, 12 NPD candidates were elected to the Landtag (state parliament) of Saxony in Dresden. They obtained 191,087 votes, or 9.2% of the poll. The NPD had only once done as well as that, in Baden-W\u00bfrttemberg in 1969. After that, it virtually disappeared from the official scene.</p> <p>Convinced as they are that Germany is now in a virtually pre-revolutionary situation, NPD leaders have the wind in their sails. Their party's headquarters are in the offices of its monthly, Deutsche Stimmung (German Opinion), in the town of Riesa, not far from Dresden. On the first floor, an editorial staff of 10 produces a paper that has a circulation of about 10,000, mostly by subscription. On sale on the ground floor are T-shirts with edifying logos, \"history\" books praising units of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS in the second world war, insignia and CDs.</p> <p>All propaganda in favour of the Nazi regime is forbidden in Germany. The NPD is a past master at apparently sticking to the letter of the law while subverting it.</p> <p>J\u00bfrgen G\u00bfnsel, who wears heavy laced boots, a black T-shirt and black jeans, sits on the NPD's national executive and is now a member of Saxony's Landtag. Still only 30, he has had a long career as a far-right activist. It began when he was at high school in Hesse and continued when he repeatedly got into trouble with the law after raising his arm and shouting \"Heil Hitler!\" in public.</p> <p>Peter Marx, 38, a former head of the NPD in the western state of Saarland, is a more discreet man than G\u00bfnsel, preferring to wear a suit and tie. He has just been voted secretary general of the NPD's parliamentary group in Saxony's Landtag, a key post that rewards his talent as an organiser. He joined the NPD in Saarland at the age of 16. A jurist and marketing consultant, he is a man of ideas.</p> <p>His supporters marched at the \"Monday demonstrations\" organised against the Gerhard Schr\u00bfder government's unpopular measures, dubbed the \"Hartz IV reforms\" after their instigator. Their banner bore the slogan \"Marx rather than Hartz\". This was a nod in the direction of communist voters present at the same demonstration, from whom the NPD has borrowed many of its anticapitalist slogans.</p> <p>In Saxony the NPD chose another communist-inspired symbol for its election stickers ? a clenched fist brandished not against fascism but against Schr\u00bfder's reforms. Several days after the election, thousands of stickers were still visible in Saxony. No one had scribbled on them or slashed them ? something that would be unthinkable in the west of the country. \"That's the way it is in our region,\" says Wolkmar W\u00bflke, an activist in the neocommunist PDS who keeps a close eye on the NPD. \"As the NPD hasn't been banned, it's legal, and as it's legal it has the right to express itself. Some of our members even go along with that. It's a hangover from the time of the German Democratic Republic, when all parties except one were banned.\"</p> <p>Four years ago a team of NPD activists from western Germany turned up in Riesa. \"We'd learned a lot from the French National Front, whose activists had helped us out in Saarland more than once,\" Marx says proudly. \"We realised we needed to personalise the debate and put forward capable people with some social standing, candidates who could put together arguments about social justice. We also adopted a number of ideas aired by Oskar Lafontaine [a former president of the Social Democrats now in bad odour with the party], such as his claim that Germany is rudderless, and that Schr\u00bfder is a liar who makes promises he doesn't keep.\"</p> <p>The NPD abandoned its loutish, aggressive style and patiently established itself in small towns and villages. It found new activists in them and, better, won over worthies disillusioned with the mainstream parties. The NPD's first elected candidates soon found their way on to local councils, thus helping to make the party respectable.</p> <p>The NPD had a two-pronged strategy aimed both at a traditional conservative electorate and at young people with no prospects at a local level. Seasoned activists started canvassing outside colleges and got involved in management of the few youth centres that had survived the break-up of the former GDR. In areas where such centres no longer existed, the activists went out to meet young people who spent their weekends drinking beer in filling-station car parks to the sound of hard rock.</p> <p>The NPD decided to turn its back on confrontation and parades of unsavoury-looking bully-boys. It resorted to a new technique: it got activists to exploit the worries of youngsters who had no choice but to seek work in western Germany. The most go-getting of them had already done so. Many of those who stayed behind were ensnared by the NPD, which exploited their resentment by pointing a finger at immigrants.</p> <p>The fact that immigration is lower in Saxony than in western Germany, and that, in a region where jobs are hard to come by immigrant labour can hardly be made out as a threat, did not worry the party strategists.</p> <p>NPD ideologues are skilled at moving the goalposts. They are prepared to use any argument. They put themselves across as critics of globalisation, enemies of the US and Israel, and strong believers in a Europe where an authoritarian Russia, the last bulwark against the Asian hordes, would be allotted its proper place.</p> <p>During the election campaign, NPD activists gave high-school students free copies of a CD on which the far right's \"bard\", Frank Rennicke, sings \"The Country of Our Fathers\", a group called Abattoir celebrates \"the hour of the patriots\" and the less distinguished singers of Noie Werte scream \"Fuck the USA!\"</p> <p>The NPD's virulent form of anti-Americanism, which condemns the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, enables it to draw a parallel with the bombings of Hamburg and Berlin in 1943 and 1945, commemorate the martyrdom of the German people, and connect Germany's present travails with the tragic past. It is a novel approach, but one that pays off: last August no fewer than 7,000 people gathered at the NPD's summer festival at M\u00bfcka, near the Polish border.</p> <p>Most of the people who voted for the NPD in Saxony were jobless and under 30. In many cases they were first-time voters and driven by frustration: according to a recent survey, 54% of NPD supporters feel they own less than they deserve. The figure for Germany as a whole is 37%.</p> <p>\"Political power can be defined by its degree of effectiveness and the legitimacy it gets from an election,\" says Klaus-Peter Sick, a historian at the Marc Bloch Centre in Berlin. \"From 1933 to 1990, the east of the country was deprived of democratic elections. Parliamentary liberal democracy does not have deep roots here. What matters more than in the rest of Germany is the cohesion of the community and what is redistributed by the regime. The preservation of democracy comes after that.</p> <p>\"The botched reunification of Germany prompted thousands of youngsters to leave their region in search of jobs. Those who stayed behind have been left by the wayside. They are embittered and prepared to throw themselves into the arms of the NPD, partly because their rebellion contradicts the knee-jerk antifascism of their parents in the GDR.\"</p> <p>With its take on a wide range of issues that feed the fears and fantasies of its constituency ? America, migratory flows, the erosion of values and of authority, unemployment ? the NPD seems to have found a way to transform the east's problems into electoral gains.</p> <p>It is hard to say whether Saxony's disorientated NPD voters were aware of the subtext involved in their choice ? the design and black-white-and-red colours of NPD posters that inevitably call to mind the Nazi flag with its swastika, the activists' marches redolent of earlier parades, and some unusually striking words buried in the middle of a speech that would not have seemed out of place in the mouth of Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels.</p> <p>In an opinion poll just after the September election, a majority of NPD voters said they chose the party purely to express their disgruntlement. The fact remains that the NPD seizes every opportunity of exploiting the subliminal effect of such parallels. Bottles thrown into the sea do occasionally reach their destination.</p>",
  "If you aren't already addicted, take a look at the electoral college vote tracker featured on the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com\"> LA Times</a> website. Forget Doom or Grand Theft Auto, this is where it's at when it comes to interactive computer fun. <p>This vote tracker offers the mildly obsessed hours of fun and the seriously compulsive politics-watcher a simple way to avoid all other avenues of their life. </p> <p>Barely a week before D-Day, the presidential contest is so deadlocked that only a fool would predict victory or defeat. However, Vote Tracker allows you to process the outcome.</p> <p>Once you get past the irksome registration process you'll find the vote tracker map on the bottom right of the home page. </p> <p>Shut the blinds, disconnect the phone; re-loadable drama and intrigue are but a mouse click away. The map opens up to show the 50 states, colour-coded to match their current allegiance, or left white if still up for grabs. Graze the cursor over any state on the map, and (here's what makes this site different from lesser models out there) the very latest state - wide polling data appears. </p> <p>Then, armed with nothing but this data and your gut feeling, you get to decide how the game will end. The map creators have been generous in allocating toss-up states, leaving 19 states blank for you to play with. </p> <p>So you may very quickly give Washington and Oregon to Kerry, Nevada, Arizona and Missouri to Bush. Head east and you'll have no problem calling New Hampshire (in play until a few days ago) for Kerry, West Virginia for Bush.</p> <p>The electoral college vote tracker calculator automatically updates the vote tally on the right of your screen. Bush now has 212 to Kerry's 175.</p> <p>You may be quite proud of yourself, having whittled down the focus to a dozen states, but this is where the fun really begins; figuring out the last 12 is what separates the men from the boys.</p> <p>At this point it's best to step away from the keyboard, crack your knuckles, blow on your fingertips and perform any other good luck rituals before resuming play. </p> <p>Let's start in the industrial Midwest. Michigan was veering towards Bush a couple of weeks ago, then moved back into the Kerry column and is now a dead heat again. On recent voting history Michigan should go Kerry's way. Pennsylvania has tightened up after leaning to Kerry in the last few days, but Nader is not on the ballot, so we'll give it to Kerry. Neighbouring Ohio should go to Kerry, where he's holding a slim lead.</p> <p>Bush and Kerry keep swapping positions in Wisconsin, a state that hasn't gone for a Republican President since Ronald Reagan. Traditional urban centres have depopulated to form new \"exurban\" townlets with new voting patterns that will have political scientists reassessing their assumptions there.</p> <p>To play this game, however, you can't be afraid of making a few assumptions. Let's assume Wisconsin breaks precedent and goes to Bush. Let's give New Mexico - where Kerry has a two point edge and a friendly governor - to Kerry. Let's assume Iowa - despite voting Democrat in the last 4 elections, but where the candidates are neck and neck - finally breaks Bush's way. </p> <p>Let's give Minnesota - deadlocked until this week, but now leaning to Kerry and a solidly Democratic state for over 30 years - to the Democrat. Lets predict New Jersey - dead even, but historically Democratic - finally sides with Kerry. And let's call Colorado - also dead even - but trending Republican in recent elections - for Bush.</p> <p>Now take a well deserved break and head to Hawaii. Hawaii is hopelessly tied with 12% undecided. 12%! What are they smoking in Hawaii to make 12% of the electorate incapable of making up their mind? Lets take a flyer with Hawaii, where Republicans haven't tasted victory since 1956, and give Hawaii's four votes to Bush.</p> <p>Checking our vote tally, we now stand at Kerry 263, Bush 242. Both candidates are looking for the magic minimum of 270 to go over the top. There are 33 votes still to be had: 27 in Florida and six in Arkansas.</p> <p>Remember to keep breathing. OK, here goes, we're going for broke now. The latest Arkansas polls have Kerry and Bush tied. Surely Bubba - looking a bit pasty after heart surgery - can still nudge his home state over to Kerry. </p> <p>So now it's down to Florida. If Jeb Bush can't make sure his state votes right for his big brother, it's going to be an uncomfortable turkey dinner for him at the Bush family Thanksgiving get-together. Recent polls have given the state to both candidates.</p> <p>If Bush holds Florida the candidates are tied at 269 apiece; a stunning turn of events, the like of which has not happened since 1800, but certainly not out of the question. A helpful pop-up box appears on the screen explaining how the election is now thrown into the hands of a Republican-led Congress. Bottom line, in this scenario, Kerry must take Florida to win. </p> <p>Or you can reload the map and start again, making for hours more harmless fun until November 2, if the outcome weren't so momentous, that is.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist.</p>",

  "<p>Home Office plans to raise visa fees and introduce more bureaucratic procedures for vetting foreign students will have a serious impact on UK universities' \u00a31bn overseas market, vice-chancellors warned today. </p> <p>They fear that attempts by one government department to increase revenue are undermining the multi-million pound business, promoted by the prime minister, Tony Blair, and other departments, at a time when competitors like Australia are chasing this market aggressively.</p> <p>\"This is a lack of joined-up government,\" Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Luton University, told EducationGuardian.co.uk. This summer he protested to the home secretary, David Blunkett, when the introduction of new visa procedures by the British consulate in Beijing lead to 60% of applicants being refused permission to come to study in the UK.</p> <p>The problem was identified as a new paper-based system, which does away with interviews and is cheaper to operate. Steps to improve procedures were taken, but not before thousands of applicants had been turned away, hitting universities in the UK, which typically charge fees of \u00a38,000 a year to overseas students.</p> <p>The new procedures are due to be rolled out to other countries, however, and universities fear there will be similarly drastic effects on their recruitment when they are applied to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh - all of which send large numbers of students. </p> <p>At the same time the Home Office is consulting on plans to double visa fees to \u00a3495 for students wanting to extend their stay. Postal applications will also become more expensive. The Home Office said this was part of a move to save UK taxpayers \u00a3100m.</p> <p>Professor Ebdon said: \"We will point out the damaging effect such a draconian increase will have on UK business. It is part of a policy to make visa offices self-sustaining. This country has got to realise that international student recruitment is a multi-million pound business. The US is the market leader, but its share is falling rapidly because they are tightening up their visa regulations after 9/11. The prime minister recognises this, but his initiative is being derailed by bureaucracy.\"</p> <p>Universities UK, which represents all university heads, is drawing up a response to the Home Office from the sector. \"Amongst other issues, universities will be considering how the UK's immigration fees compete with other countries' international student charges, whether there is any risk to market share on the basis of price comparison alone,\" said a spokeswoman.</p> <p>Fees paid by overseas students to British universities jumped 24% to more than \u00a31bn, paid by 184,685 international (non-EU) students, the Higher Education Statistics Agency reported this year. </p> <p>The British Council forecasts that next year 26,800 students from mainland China will seek to study at UK universities and higher education colleges, with 9,100 from Hong Kong, 4,700 from Taiwan, 4,200 from Singapore and 6,000 from Japan. The biggest contingent is expected to come from Greece - 28,000 - but they will pay home fees of \u00a31,125. </p> <p>Soaring overseas numbers prompted the National Union of Students to appoint an international officer for the first time in September to look after their interests. Benson Osawe, from Benin City in Nigeria, is the first African to sit on the union's national executive.</p>",

  "<p>Once this too was the wild west. The red sky blazes over the mountains, the wide river reflecting its fire amid broken islands of ice. The train hurtles through the wilderness. But the mountains are the Catskills, more famous now for Jewish comedy than hunting, the river is the Hudson, and the train is a suburban service heading into New York City. It's a long time since the east coast was the western wilderness. To see it in that way, you have to go back to the 19th-century paintings of Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, who lingered in this landscape. The Hudson river school were the first artists to discover American space. In Cole's paintings, the Catskills represent untamed wilderness, all deep gorges, knotted forests, and never a glimpse of Mel Brooks. </p> <p>The image of the American wilderness began here, before going west with the wagon trains, after the civil war. Already, by the 1850s, Church was travelling to South America in search of more exotic panoramas. In 1859 he exhibited The Heart of the Andes in a darkened Manhattan gallery, illuminated by gas jets, surrounded by real tropical plants - there was a demand in New York City for these precociously cinematic vistas. By 1863 the German immigrant Albert Bierstadt was in the Rocky Mountains, portraying a Shoshone Indian camp beside a lake. The hide tepees in Bierstadt's painting form a simple and romantic human community nestling in a shady Eden beneath the sublime white peaks and dazzling waterfalls of the Rockies. </p> <p>Yet the greatest artist of the American wilderness, who drew deeply on Church and Bierstadt, was not a painter. The west's visual genius was the Irish-American film director John Ford. </p> <p>You see Ford's archetypal landscape in his great 1956 film The Searchers. Here it is white Americans who have created a little sanctuary in the middle of the wilderness; the farmhouse to which John Wayne returns after years as a Confederate soldier - and, it is hinted, outlaw - is a warm cosy interior. Outside is a bright, hard, empty nowhere; a spectacular wilderness of orange rocks sticking in the air like God's bones picked dry by the sun. And out there are Indians. Wayne is brilliant in The Searchers, his face a shard of stone, but the poetry of the film - of all Ford's cinema - is achieved through his unrivalled use of the American landscape. A new book on the director who defined Hollywood's wild west, from his early silent The Iron Horse (1924) through to his mythic masterpieces of the 1950s, demonstrates how Ford's films are steeped in precise visual quotations from the 19th-century artists who first invented the image of the west. </p> <p>After the defeat of the slave-holding south and the establishment by the civil war of the United States as we know it, Americans in the late 1860s wanted, to quote Mr Burns in The Simpsons, to wallow in their own crapulence - specifically, to conquer the western interior of North America. By 1869 the west and east coasts were joined when the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads were joined at Promontory Point. First on the trains westward were artists. The Hudson river painters had made America a fit subject for the gallery; photographers were employed to document the building of the continental railroad itself. The west was myth from the beginning. By the 1870s, the frontiersman William S Cody - Buffalo Bill - was wowing New York audiences and his Wild West Show would tour the world. Wild Bill Hickok joined him as a guest. Their lives were also chronicled in cheap novels and exaggerated biographies. </p> <p>Above all, the visual image of the west that was to shape Hollywood's most all-American genre was created by Frederic Remington, John Quincy Adams Ward, Charles C Schreyvogel and other illustrators of a picturesque and epic dusty emptiness where \"Red Indian\" braves with feathered headdresses and rifles eternally fight the blue-clad Seventh Cavalry. </p> <p>You can show, point by point, how immersed John Ford was in their art. Remington, greatest of the western illustrators in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, translated his paintings very profitably into bronzes that still fetch enormous prices; by the 1900s they were being bought by the Metropolitan Museum. Ford knew Remington's original paintings, less famous now, intimately. A still from Ford's My Darling Clementine has Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp on horseback in a pose that accurately repeats Remington's picture The Alert (1888). </p> <p>There is, however, one telling difference. It's true that Ford owes a great deal to western illustrators - after all, Remington died in 1909; Ford made The Iron Horse just 15 years later. There is no great chronological gap between 19th-century painting and the first silent westerns. But Ford is a far greater artist than Remington or Schreyvogel. His real genius is for landscape and his true tradition is that of the Hudson river school and, behind that, the European romantics JMW Turner and Caspar David Friedrich. </p> <p>In Remington's painting The Alert, the cowboy has stopped on a dusty, nondescript plain. You never see dusty, nondescript plains in Ford's films. When he repeats this figure in My Darling Clementine we see, looming behind Henry Fonda, the awesome outcrops of a lunar landscape: ancient surreal rock formations sculpted when the only Americans were dinosaurs. </p> <p>It's an unreal, phantasmagoric place, Ford's America: an unashamedly sublime, romantic, sinister spectacle. Above all, it is empty. Only the rocky pinnacles really seem to belong; both the whites and their native American enemies are just specks on the wilderness. </p> <p>Once, the Catskills represented wilderness. For John Ford, the place that mythically epitomised frontier life was Monument Valley, Arizona. This sandstone landscape is now, and was when Ford filmed there, a Navajo reservation. He employed the Navajo as extras, and was proud that he paid them good rates; he also helped them with food supplies in times of crisis and became a blood-brother of the Navajo nation. In his films almost all the \"Indians\" - be they Comanche, Apache, Sioux - are local Navajo. </p> <p>Monument Valley is far too wild ever to have been part of the history of American interior colonisation - it is barren, untamable; that's why it was made into a reservation. But Ford filmed there again and again, insisting that this lunar nowhere was the true America. He built temporary towns here, forts, homesteads. In My Darling Clementine, the town of Tombstone is unreally set against the sandstone fingers; the OK Corral is surrounded by cacti and space. In The Searchers, we are told repeatedly that Monument Valley is Texas. </p> <p>It all makes Ford's films a magnificent series of artworks, anticipating the sculptors of the 1960s and 70s who made earthworks and lightning conductors in the desert. Ford's insistence that Monument Valley is America is one of the greatest imaginative feats of his culture. But this is a harsh, empty, violent, tragic land-scape. Again and again, Ford uses landscape to communicate aching loss, despair and isolation. </p> <p>His westerns are the greatest and most influential ever made, yet they have more in common with later anti-westerns and spaghetti westerns than with the patriotic mainstream of the genre. Every story Ford tells is complex and unsettling. Take the gunfight, which became, in mid-20th-century westerns, a mythic test of manhood and courage. In High Noon, directed by Fred Zinnemann in 1952, sheriff Gary Cooper must stand alone against evil. Contrast Ford's story of the gunfight at the OK Corral in My Darling Clementine. The good guys include tubercular, drunken, depressed, morally ambiguous Doc Holliday. They fight not in the open but hiding behind fences, in a dust cloud, so they can't see who they're shooting. The men who have to be killed are not frightening so much as pathetic. A Shakespearean actor visiting Tombstone recites - at gunpoint - Hamlet's meditation on whether to go on living. </p> <p>But Ford's masterpiece is The Searchers. Here landscape is all. At the end of the film everyone is back inside a homestead. But Wayne barely enters before walking out again into the desert that is an image of his own inner life, consumed by racism and vendetta. He is last seen framed against the glowing landscape on a threshold he can never get back inside. For this revenge-obsessed American, there is no fulfilment. In Texas, they call this despair. </p> <p>John Ford and The American West, by Peter Cowie, is published on November 19 by Abrams at \u00a329.95.</p>",

But you will have a very good time, and you'll understand why feminism had to happen. </p> <p>The Women is the story of nice girl Mary Haines (played by Norma Shearer), sporty and straightforward, who loses her husband to shop-girl vamp Crystal Allen, a red-lipped, black-eyed Joan Crawford. Swimming around the disaster like sharks around a shipwreck are Mary's friends; a group of women with nothing to do except eat lunch and get their nails painted Jungle Red in Sydney's Beauty Parlour. </p> <p>In 1939, the movie was promoted as a bitch-bath; throw the girls in together, turn up the heat and watch them fight it out. And they did - on and off the screen. Thanking her top-billing co-star, Norma Shearer, Crawford said: \"I love to play bitches, and Norma helped me in this part.\" </p> <p>If you believe the message of this movie, women cannot be trusted - with each other, with themselves, and certainly not with men. The only stable relationships within the group are between mother and daughter across two generations, presumably because they are not in competition. And of course, the competition is for those invisible marvels - the men. </p> <p>There are 135 females on set - including every horse, hound, monkey and guinea pig - but the only topic of conversation is Men. Or, as French feminist Monique Wittig put it 30 years later, Woman is a Man-shaped hole. </p> <p>The Women seemed to have natural authenticity because its writers were female. This was not a man's take on the true life of a woman, but women talking frankly about themselves. There are no dumb blondes or doormats; all of these women know the score and can tot it up in their heads without a calculator. If anyone is the object of sympathy, the real victim, it is not Mary Haines, but her poor husband Stephen, tossed about by his primal urges and snatched by a Fifth Avenue tiger. </p> <p>Women, it seems, and not men, are the predators of the urban jungle. Women lure and snare men, castrate them into domesticity, then sue them for alimony when they stray. </p> <p>Down in Reno, getting a divorce, Mary Haines is berated by another Reno refugee, played by Paulette Goddard, for abandoning her man in his time of need. When a man is cheating on you, you don't divorce him, you stand by him. This is the advice Mary has heard already from her mother, who confesses that her own husband, Mary's father, was a paragon in every way, except one - yet mother learned to turn a blind eye. She has one other piece of womanly wisdom to impart: \"Don't confide in your girlfriends. If you do, they'll see to it in the name of friendship that you lose your husband and your home.\" </p> <p>Which is exactly what happens to Mary, thanks to the efforts of Mrs Howard Fowler, the meanest woman in Manhattan, marvellously played by Rosalind Russell as a kind of human landmine. \"Tread carefully round that one,\" counsels Mrs Fowler, referring to Joan Crawford's Crystal Allen, but it is Mrs Fowler herself who detonates every situation that might just be defused. She is bored and dangerous, disguising her malice as friendship, and although she gets her comeuppance, she remains the most uncomfortable character portrayal in the movie: a woman who enjoys causing trouble, even heartbreak, because she has nothing better to do. </p> <p>MGM made much of the fact that no body doubles were used in any of the cat fights between the \"girls\", so much so that when Rosalind Russell lunges at Paulette Goddard for stealing her husband, the bite on Goddard's leg was said to have left a permanent scar. Goddard hobbles away with the unforgettable retort: \"Sure, I make Howard Fowler pay for what he wants - you made him pay for what he didn't want.\" </p> <p>This is a film about money - men have it, women don't, unless they can get a man to give it to them. Who can blame Crystal, the ambitious shop-girl, for wanting the things she sells to her wealthy clients? The choice between a lifetime of \"Yes madam, my pleasure\" and \"Champagne? Right you are!\" is not difficult to make. </p> <p>In a delicious scene at the fashion house, Mary Haines is hesitating over a sexy piece of lingerie when Crystal Allen flounces past her and orders a dozen. The scene that follows in the plush fitting rooms shows sweet-tempered Mary to be no match for her gold-digging rival. Warned that Stephen will not admire the gold lam\u00e9 outfit his mistress is about to charge to his account, Crystal guns Mary out of the door on the line: \"Thanks for the tip, but when anything I wear doesn't please Stephen, I take it off.\" </p> <p>Crystal is the villain of the piece, but she is the only woman in the movie who is not living a self-deluding fantasy. Apart from the black maids and the Noo Jersey beauty therapists with accents thicker than their mud baths, Crystal is the one woman who must work for a living, and who sees the world as it is. She is neither cynical nor sentimental. She lives in a society where money is everything, and where no woman can earn enough, either through talent or hard work. The film doesn't question this status quo - it leaves it unchallenged at every level. The only power women can use is the power of their bodies; who can blame Crystal for starting another affair soon after she has persuaded Stephen to marry her? </p> <p>Judging from the huge response to the film, shop-girls everywhere were on Crystal's side. They'd do the same themselves if they got the chance. Crystal's parting shot, as she walks out of the movie, sums up the sense of sisterhood the women feel for one another in their hour of need: \"There's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society - outside of a kennel.\" </p> <p>\"See them with their hair down and their claws out\" ran the movie strapline, making much of the film's authenticity, but while everything on screen is female - even the pictures on the wall have no men in them - the eye behind the camera was male. George Cukor directed the movie, and although he was known for being a first-rate director of actresses - perhaps because he was gay - his is a camp, full-on drag queen production, from the frocks and the hats to the stereotypes of \"pal\", \"bitch\", \"vamp\". These versions of women are both funny and frightening, because 75 years of a changing economic world have completely altered the way many women look at the film. It doesn't feel true or authentic - it feels like drag. The only women you are likely to meet nowadays who look or act like this are men. </p> <p>It will be fascinating to see what Hollywood does with the remake, due to go into production next year. Like The Stepford Wives remake, it will be impossible to put an all-star Hollywood cast in a situation where the women are entirely dependent on what they can get from men - by fair means or foul. At least, I hope it will be impossible. </p> <p>We can celebrate our progress in all ways but one. The irony of the film is that the actresses playing the women were better paid than most of the men in Hollywood, and capable of opening a huge film without a male lead. In the golden age of the Hollywood studio system, women, not men, were top of the tree, and if the jungle of the sexes underneath them fought by different rules, you wouldn't know it on set. These women had all the power. In Hollywood now, only Julia Roberts is paid as much as her male stars, and no woman is box-office enough to carry a major movie on her own in the way that Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford can. </p> <p>It's a sobering thought - enough to make any woman reach for the bottle (something the players in The Women do with refreshing and un-PC candour). The remedy for despair is simple: \"Get me a bromide and put some gin in it.\" Maybe we still have something to learn from The Women after all. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Women will be re-released on November 5 and will be showing as part of a George Cukor retrospective at the NFT, London SE1.
