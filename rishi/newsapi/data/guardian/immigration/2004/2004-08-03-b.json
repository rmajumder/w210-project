  "Britain and the US last night faced fresh allegations of abuses after a British terror suspect said an SAS soldier had interrogated him for three hours while an American colleague pointed a gun at him and threatened to shoot him. <p>The allegation is contained in a new dossier detailing repeated beatings and humiliation suffered by three Britons who were captured in Afghanistan, then held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay for two years, before being released in March without charge. </p> <p>Rhuhel Ahmed, one of the \"Tipton Three\", claims in the 115-page dossier that shortly after his capture in November 2001 he was interviewed in Afghanistan by a British interrogator who said he was from the SAS. Mr Ahmed alleges he was taken by US guards to be interrogated by the British officer in a tent. \"One of the US soldiers had a gun to his head and he was told if he moved they would shoot him,\" the report says. The SAS officer pressed him to admit he had gone to Afghanistan to fight a holy war. Last night the Ministry of Defence said it would investigate the allegation. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"The British army follows the rules laid out in the Geneva convention and soldiers are told to follow that. It is not permissible to point guns at people's heads during interrogation. We would investigate if any allegation of that nature is made.\" </p> <p>The dossier, based on two months of interviews by the men's lawyers, provides the first full account by the three Britons of their ordeal as terror suspects. </p> <p>Details of the experiences of Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed, all from the same small Midlands town, are revealed today by the Guardian, and will be formally released this afternoon in the US. The three Britons allege they were repeatedly beaten, shackled in painful positions during interrogations and subjected to sleep deprivation. On one occasion, Mr Iqbal recalled: \"I was left in a room and strobe lighting was put on and very loud music. It was a dance version of Eminem played repeatedly.\" </p> <p>Mr Rasul said he was asked: \"If I wanted to get surface-to-air missiles from someone in Tipton, who would I go to?\" </p> <p>In an echo of the abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib jail in Baghdad which shamed Washington, the three Britons, held as illegal enemy combatants by the US, say they were photographed naked and subjected to anal searches unnecessarily, after being shackled for hours. </p> <p>The three claim their interrogators, from a phalanx of US intelligence agencies including the CIA, accused them of being in a video shot in 2000 alongside Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader, and Mohamed Atta, the leader of the September 11 attack. At the time one of the three was working in a Currys electrical store in the Midlands and two others were in trouble with the British police. Despite this, all three say the pain they were in and ill treatment led them confess to being in the video. </p> <p>The dossier also alleges complicity by Britain in their treatment. The three challenge a claim by the Foreign Office junior minister, Chris Mullin, who in the Commons said no Briton had complained of their treatment in Guant\u00e1namo. Mr Iqbal says a British embassy official took down a two-page list of alleged abuses, while the two others say they made their complaints orally. Mr Rasul says he was interrogated by British personnel up to seven times, with MI5 officers questioning the Britons repeatedly. </p> <p>On June 4 last year Tony Blair told the Commons: \"Information is still coming from people detained there ... that information is important.\" </p> <p>In the dossier the Britons say the level of mental illness among detainees is higher than admitted by the US. The Tipton Three say guards told them that a fellow British detainee, Moazzam Begg, still imprisoned in Guant\u00e1namo, had been kept in isolation and \"was in a very bad way\". They say that Jamil el-Banna, of London, was so traumatised that \"mentally, basically, he's finished\". </p> <p>Mr Banna is a Jordanian citizen with refugee status in Britain, but the government refuses to represent him. It also refuses to represent another Londoner, Bisher al-Rawi, originally from Iraq, who lived in Kingston, south-west London. </p> <p>Lawyer Gareth Peirce said the report showed Britain's complicity in the human rights abuses at Guant\u00e1namo: \"The [British government] attitude displayed the hypocrisy of the public face in the UK saying we're doing all we can and the private face there in Guant\u00e1namo involved up to their elbows in the oppression.\" </p> <p>Nine Britons were imprisoned in Guant\u00e1namo without charge or access to a lawyer. The Tipton Three were among five released in March, who were questioned on arrival in Britain before being released. Four Britons remain in Guant\u00e1namo, as well as four British residents.</p>",
  "The Britons Rhuhel Ahmed, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul were detained in northern Afghanistan on November 28 2001 by forces loyal to the warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum. The three, from Tipton in the Midlands, were handed over to US forces before being sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay as suspected terrorists. <p>The \"Tipton three\" were released from Guant\u00e1namo in March this year, and after being flown back to Britain they were released without charge.</p> <p>Today the Guardian publishes extracts from a 115-page report based on lengthy interviews they gave about their treatment by US and UK officials and military.</p> <p>When released, they took payment from the media for interviews in which they alleged ill treatment. Their accounts were dismissed in some quarters, but since the revelations about the abuses at Abu Ghraib jail in Iraq, there has been renewed questioning about how far the US is willing to go in the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>The report, Detention in Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo, has been compiled by the three men's lawyers, and is being released in the US today. It makes new allegations and gives extensive details about the treatment they suffered, which led them to make false confessions about their involvement in terrorism. </p> <p>The Guardian paid no money to the three men or any of their representatives to publish these extracts from the report. </p> <p><b>Arriving at Guant\u00e1namo</b><br>The terror, despair and anxiety of prisoners is laid bare by the released Britons, who describe their fear \"that we might be killed at any minute\" after their detention by US forces. </p> <p>Their two-and-a-half-year ordeal has also left them with serious physical problems including knee and back pain - because of the positions in which they were shackled - and, in the case of Rhuhel Ahmed, permanent eye damage. </p> <p>Their capture by the Northern Alliance was followed by a gruelling journey through Afghanistan in lorry containers, which only 20 of the 200 captives survived. It left all three suffering from \"cold, dehydration, hunger and uncertainty\" as well as dysentery and injuries. </p> <p>US forces allegedly kicked and beat prisoners following the handover. </p> <p>\"One of [the soldiers] said 'you killed my family in the towers, and now it's time to get you back',\" said Mr Iqbal. </p> <p>\"They kept calling us 'motherfuckers', and I think over three or four hours ... I must have been punched, kicked, slapped or struck with a rifle butt at least 30 or 40 times,\" he said. </p> <p>Two weeks later Mr Iqbal and Mr Rasul were flown from Kandahar to Cuba, to be followed a month later by Mr Ahmed. Before their removal, they were hooded and forced to strip, then left naked. </p> <p>\"I could hear dogs barking nearby and soldiers shouting, 'get 'em boy',\" said Mr Rasul. \"I was taken ... for a so-called cavity search ... told to bend over and then felt something shoved up my anus. I don't know what it was but it was very painful.\" </p> <p>The men alleged that the forced cavity searches were used to degrade and humiliate them, that they were systematically deprived of sleep and that they were kept on a restricted diet to weaken them. </p> <p>Despite slightly better physical conditions in Cuba, they remained \"at a high level of fear\" throughout their detention. </p> <p>\"When we first got there the level was sky-high. We were terrified we might be killed at any minute. The guards would say, 'Nobody knows you're here, all they know is that you're missing and we could kill you and no one would know,'\" they allege. </p> <p>\"After time passed, that level of fear came down somewhat but never vanished ... Not only could they do anything to any of us, but we could see them doing it to other detainees. We thought that we would never get out.\" </p> <p>Mr Iqbal, who believes he suffered a breakdown after spending months in isolation and on a block with non-English-speaking detainees, believes that authorities deliberately fostered mental anguish - \"they had thought carefully about the best way to punish me and break me.\" </p> <p><b> Conditions in the camp</b><br>The treatment of prisoners worsened dramatically after the arrival of the US commander Major General Geoffrey Miller, the report alleges. Gen Miller ran Guant\u00e1namo for 18 months until last April, then going on to manage prisons in Iraq. </p> <p>The report paints a disturbing picture of the rat, snake and scorpion-infested cages in which the men lived, exposed to blistering daytime temperatures, freezing nights and torrential rain. </p> <p>It details alleged abuses and deliberately inhumane practices - such as sleep deprivation, shackling in painful positions and sexual humiliation - implying that these were deliberately used to encourage detainees to cooperate. </p> <p>\"We had the impression that at the beginning things were not carefully planned, but a point came at which you could notice things changing. That appeared to be after Gen Miller [arrived] around the end of 2002,\" said Mr Rasul. </p> <p>\"That is when short-shackling [when detainees are chained into a squatting position] started, loud music playing in interrogation, shaving beards and hair, putting people in cells naked, taking away people's 'comfort' items [eg towels] ... moving some people every two hours, depriving them of sleep, the use of a/c [air-conditioned, cold] air. </p> <p>\"Before, when people would be put into blocks for isolation, they would seem to stay for not more than a month. After he came, people would be kept there for months and months and months. </p> <p>\"Although sexual provocation, molestation did not happen to us, we are sure it happened to others ... One detainee came back from an interrogation crying and confided in another what had happened. That detainee told others and then other detainees revealed that it had happened to them.\" </p> <p>This year, the camp's original commander, Brigadier General Rick Baccus, told the Guardian that military interrogators were angered by the conditions he granted to prisoners. After his departure, the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, gave military intelligence control over all aspects of Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>The Washington Post reported that under Gen Miller a system was instituted which allowed hooding or keeping prisoners naked for more than 30 days, threatening by dogs, and extreme temperatures. </p> <p>After Gen Miller took control of Iraqi prisons in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal, he banned some practices, such as hooding, while defending others such as sleep deprivation. </p> <p>But General Janis Karpinski, whom he replaced, claimed that he had earlier told her: \"This place [Abu Ghraib] must be Gitmo-ised ... [prisoners] are like dogs.\" The US military refers to Guant\u00e1namo Bay as Gitmo. Gen Miller has denied the allegation. </p> <p><b> Interrogations</b><br>Detainees cracked and gave false confessions under pressure from interrogators who did everything from showing them photographs of Donald Duck to beating them and holding guns to their heads, the men allege. </p> <p>After months of questioning in coercive conditions, Mr Rasul admitted meeting Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta, one of the September 11 hijackers, in Afghanistan in 2000. In fact, he was working in a Currys store in the West Midlands. </p> <p>\"Eventually I just gave in and said, 'OK, it's me' ... because of the previous five or six weeks of being held in isolation and being taken to interrogation for hours on end, short shackled and being treated in that way,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I was going out of my mind and didn't know what was going on. I was desperate for it to end.\" He was cleared when M15 produced evidence showing the three were all in England at the time. </p> <p>The report describes the extraordinary techniques employed by military interrogators. Mr Iqbal described US soldiers holding a gun to his head and beating him during interrogations in Afghanistan. </p> <p>He added: \"An American ... shouted at me, telling me I was al-Qaida. I said I was not involved in al-Qaida and did not support them. At this he started to punch me violently and then when he knocked me to the floor started to kick me around my back and in my stomach.\" </p> <p>Interrogations at Guant\u00e1namo Bay were less violent but frequently involved physical stress - often in intense heat or cold, with detainees chained into painful squatting positions. On one occasion, Mr Iqbal recalled, \"I was left in a room and strobe lighting was put on and very loud music. It was a dance version of Eminem played repeatedly.\" </p> <p>Mr Rasul described being shown \"photographs of Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Rugrats, Abraham Lincoln, Michael Jackson, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Osama bin Laden and famous people from different countries.\" </p> <p>At other interviews, he was asked: \"If I wanted to get surface-to-air missiles from someone in Tipton, who would I go to?\" </p> <p><b>Role of British officials</b><br>The report suggests British officials made repeated visits to Guant\u00e1namo to question Britons who had been subjected to alleged ill-treatment by the US. </p> <p>Consular officials, who visited at least six times, were supposed to ensure the welfare of the Britons, yet were always accompanied by MI5 officers. </p> <p>Mr Iqbal claims that the embassy official once acted like \"a third interrogator\", asking him not about his welfare, but about other matters. </p> <p>Mr Ahmed says he was interrogated in Kandahar by both a Foreign Office official and an MI5 officer, who told him the other two Britons had gone home because they cooperated. In fact they were on their way to Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>During an interview with Foreign Office staff and with an MI5 officer present, Mr Ahmed says he confessed to every allegation put to him, including going to Afghanistan to fight jihad at the expense of the al-Muhajiroun group. </p> <p>He had eaten next to no food for weeks and was suffering from sleep deprivation and extreme cold. He said the British officials \"did not seem to care or even ask him about the conditions.\" </p> <p>British officials saw all three men within three days of their arrival in Cuba. Mr Rasul says he was interviewed under armed guard by someone who said he was from the British embassy in Washington and someone from MI5. </p> <p>He said: \"The MI5 officer told me in no uncertain terms that if I did not cooperate they could make life very difficult for me.\" </p> <p>He was told if he admitted going to Afghanistan for jihad, he could return to England. Mr Rasul says he was interviewed twice by MI5 in Camp X-ray, and Mr Ahmed once. Mr Iqbal says British intelligence questioned him four times over three months. His first interrogation by MI5 lasted between six and eight hours. </p> <p>One MI5 interrogator told Mr Rasul that he would stay in Guant\u00e1namo for the rest of his life. During one interview, he says, he noticed that he was being filmed. </p> <p>During his fourth interview, Mr Iqbal says he refused to answer questions put to him by US and UK interrogators. Both left the room and then a British embassy official entered. He said Mr Iqbal should tell him about his grievances. Mr Iqbal stayed silent until he was shown letters from his family and told if could only have them if he cooperated. </p> <p>\"I was desperate to get some letters from my family, so I started to speak,\" Mr Iqbal said. </p> <p>He \"remembers clearly\" that the official wrote down his list of grievances for the first time. </p> <p>These included infections he was suffering from untreated wounds caused by iron leg shackles; being led naked to and from the showers; poor food; disrespect shown to their religion; and sleep deprivation. The complaint ran to two pages. Mr Rasul says he complained to a British embassy official called Martin, telling him that he had been kept in isolation for three months. Again, nothing seemed to happen. </p> <p>The report concludes: \"It was very clear to all three that MI5 was content to benefit from the effect of the isolation, sleep deprivation and other forms of acutely painful and degrading treatment, including short shackling.\" </p> <p>The men expressed considerable anger that \"there was never any suggestion on the part of the British interrogators that this treatment was wrong\". </p> <p><b>Prisoners' mental illness</b><br>There have been \"several hundred\" suicide attempts, many more than suggested in official accounts, according to the report. </p> <p>Camp authorities recorded around 32 attempts by prisoners to kill themselves before they stopped counting them and created a new category of \"manipulative self-injurious behaviour\", for which figures are not disclosed. </p> <p>But the report suggests that attempted suicides are just the tip of the iceberg. It describes in vivid detail the deteriorating mental health of prisoners, including Britons, and alleges that guards have assaulted men who have serious health problems. </p> <p>The men said that a high percentage of detainees were on anti-depressants and that at least 100 were observably mentally ill, as distinct from being depressed about their situation. </p> <p>They added: \"For at least 50 of those their behaviour is so disturbed as to show that they are no longer capable of rational thought or behaviour ... </p> <p>\"It is something that only a small child or animal might behave like ... These people were obviously seriously ill and yet we understand [from the military police] that they still get interrogated, and if they say someone is from al-Qaida then that information is used.\" </p> <p>The men claimed to have witnessed the beating of one man who suffered from mental illness - Jumah al-Dousari from Bahrain - for impersonating a female soldier. </p> <p>Eight soldiers repeatedly punched Mr Dousari, smashed his face into the concrete floor until his nose was broken, and kicked him in the stomach. </p> <p>\"When they took him out they hosed the cell down and the water ran red with blood,\" Mr Rasul said in the report. </p> <p>In another incident, a Saudi Arabian prisoner allegedly suffered irreversible brain damage when guards beat him up after he tried to kill himself. </p> <p>The account raises particular concerns about the mental state of British residents and citizens, in particular Jamil el-Banna, a Jordanian refugee who lived in London. </p> <p>\"Mentally, basically he's finished,\" Mr Rasul said. </p> <p>\"They told him he was going to be sent back to Jordan and he was extremely scared ... [it] meant to him the end of his life. He knew that he would be tortured or killed there.\" </p> <p>The report also says that Feroz Abbasi, from Croydon, \"was getting a very hard time\" and that guards reported Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, to be \"in a very bad way\".</p>",
  "<p> 1980 Allan Wells</p> <p>At the height of the Cold War, the 1980 Moscow Olympics achieved notoriety due to the boycott of the event by the United States. The absence of the strong American track-and-field team allowed Allan Wells of Britain and the Cuban Silvio Leonard to enter the 100 metres as favourites for the gold medal. Wells, having never used the starting blocks until a rule change forced him to do so for the Olympics, reached the final where he faced the pre-race favourite Leonard. Both Wells and the Cuban set a final time of 10.25sec but Wells crossed the line slightly earlier to become the oldest Olympic 100m champion at that time. The Guardian's report on the race illustrated how close the finish was, \"Wells started none too well, surged powerfully and dramatically to beat off a dashing challenge as he dipped into the tape. Most of us thought the Cuban in the far lane had done it, but not Wells, who jogged at once into a self-saluting circle of honour around the track.\"</p> <p>1976 Nadia Comaneci</p> <p>Born in 1961 in Onesti, Romania, Nadia Elena Comaneci arrived at the 1976 Montreal Olympics suffering from sciatica, which made strong movements of her legs painful. She was 4'11\" tall, barely 86 pounds. Many gave her no hope. But she proved the doubters wrong when she competed on the uneven bars, scoring a perfect 10 - a world's first. She would score six more 10s before the end of the Olympics becoming an international media darling in the process. She left Montreal with seven perfect 10s and three gold medals. The Guardian's reported how the scoring computer was ill equipped to deal with her unique talent, \"Miss Comaneci's achievement took the results computer unawares. It rejected the 10pts because this was unprecedented. But even a computer can be persuaded to accept the progress of sport.\"</p> <p> 1968 Bob Beamon</p> <p>Some sporting moments simply defy all comprehension- but the feat that may top them all came on Oct. 18, 1968, at the Olympic Games in Mexico City. Bob Beamon, a 22-year-old New Yorker, barely qualified for the Olympic long jump finals after fouling in two of his qualifying runs. The following day in the finals, Beamon took off down the runway in the thin air of Mexico City. After exactly 19 loping strides, he hit the board perfectly, stretched out with his legs and flew through the air, almost landing outside the pit. He immediately knew he had done something special. The Guardian described the wait for the result, \" There were long moments while the leap was measured...the first indication that the crowd got of some momentous event was when Beamon danced around the track, coming to rest on his haunches, dropping his head to the ground and enclosing his arms about his head, completely overcome with emotion. \" His jump was recorded at 29 feet 2\u00bd inches. He shattered the world record by an unbelievable 21 \u00be inches. When stadium announcers gave the distance, Beamon was so excited and emotionally drained that doctors claim he suffered a \"cataplectic seizure.\"</p> <p> 1952 Emile Zatopek</p> <p>Born in Moravia in 1922, Emile Zatopek arrived at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics having already won a gold medal in the 1948 London Olympics. But he was about to surpass all his previous achievements. In the space of two weeks, Zatopek or the \"Engine\" as he was universally known, completed arguably the greatest achievement in Olympic history, winning gold medals in the 5000 metres, 10 000 m and the marathon. The Guardian recorded Zatopek's triumph in the 10,000m. \"Zatopek retained his Olympic 10,000 metres title here yesterday. It was yet another of his remorseless, almost cruel races, in which he looked ready to give up through exhaustion at any moment and yet ground down his opponents one after another.\"</p> <p> 1948 Fanny Blankers-Koen</p> <p>Born in 1918 in Baarn, Holland, Francina Elsje \"Fanny\" Blankers-Koen was considered too old by the press to be a real favourite in the 1948 London Olympics. This may have been a motivating factor for the Dutchwoman as she went on to win four gold medals in an overwhelming fashion - the 100 m, 200 m, 80 m hurdles and the 4 x 100 m. Some believe that Blankers-Koen, world-record holder in the high jump, long jump and pentathlon at the time, could have won more medals had she competed in these events, but she herself indicated she would not have had the strength to compete in all these events.</p>",
  "<p>A strange thing happened the other day. I read Jeff Powell's Daily Mail column on the FA fiasco and I thought, yup, he's got this right, spot on, bit about the Soho Square cesspit and all. He missed out the stuff about asylum seekers and how house prices will fall faster than Sven's underpants, but by and large I agree. It's a scandal, kick the lot out and bring back someone of absolute and proven probity. Like El Tel. </p> <p>Then bzzzz, suddenly it was half past seven in the morning and Terry Wogan was joshing me gently awake from the bedside radio-alarm. It had, of course, all been a bad dream. You have no idea of the relief. Before you could say Faria Wotserface I'd have been campaigning for Michael Howard, bringing back the birch and moving to Tunbridge Wells. </p> <p>Now, before we go any further, cards on the table. My interest in football comes somewhere below that for dressage and tag wrestling. I know it is hard to imagine but there are some among us who believe it a sport which looks in a mirror and likes far too much what it sees. The preening, the self-delusion that it is the only thing that makes the world rotate daily on its axis, the notion that you are fit for little else than the madhouse if you do not own up to following a team. It has become a fashion item, this year's pashmina. In short, it is, for me, a once special game plunged into the depths by self-aggrandisement, greed, avarice and the moral turpitude of a selection of those young men, wealthy beyond their dreams, who would not know how to behave in a bawdy-house (and they seem to have plenty of practice in that regard) never mind civilised company. And a crap England team to boot. Cesspit is not a bad comparison. </p> <p>So, given all that, why is it that I am astounded by the reaction to the shenanigans that have already cost two jobs, may result in a third, and could yet see the England coach on his bike, albeit considerably richer than he already is. Please explain, because for the life of me I cannot understand, why an unmarried middle-aged millionaire with a receding hairline, iffy specs, comedy teeth and a desire to be taller than he is, should be on the verge of getting the heave-ho just because he was able to cop off with whoever he wanted. Or, for that matter, why a second grey-haired middle-aged bachelor should already have cleared his desk and gone for doing precisely the same thing. If the sack came to anyone who shagged the secretary there would be no more office parties and the job centres would be bursting at the seams. </p> <p>No actually, don't bother explaining. The answer, to someone on the periphery, is crystal clear. Sven, in the estimation of the tabloids, for whom there is no middle ground, has not cut the mustard results-wise. So he has to go and his employers feel they must tag along with media, and from that, public opinion. The problem is that he, shrewder with money than defensive formations apparently, has acquired himself such a tasty deal that it will bankrupt the game to get rid of him. Unless that is he can be shown to have breached the terms of his contract. </p> <p>But now what's this? He has been porking and didn't tell anyone. Now correct me if I am wrong but wasn't the thrust of the reaction to him doing the same a while back to a former weather- girl along the lines of \"Good Old Sven\". </p> <p>And is it in his contract anyway that he has to disclose to his employers the extent of his sexual appetite? That was then though and this is now. He is devious for not bragging about it and, added to that, he is a terrible one for listening to offers from other prospective employers even when he is under contract. That never happens in newspapers, just ask the football correspondents for starters. </p> <p>There is an expedient here and I have seen it before, in cricket, when Mike Gatting lost his job not for a stand-up barney with a Pakistani umpire (which even to the player would not have been unfair) but for allegations of impropriety with a Leicestershire barmaid some six months later. Cricket's authorities needed a get-out, just as football and its minions seem to want now so the same trick is being tried on Sven. </p> <p>The FA stuffed up. Mark Palios, who seems a strong enough personality if his dealing with the numskull Rio Ferdinand is anything to go by, nevertheless agreed a ludicrous deal with Eriksson which they must have soon regretted. Now, so their legal eagles tell them, there is a chink of a get-out. Only a chink mind. </p> <p>He may well go, and willingly too, thinking he has taken the team as far as he can. But he will take the contents of the safe with him and jolly good luck to him say I. The FA deserve all they get for being total tossers when all they needed to say was zilch. As it is, the only sensible words on the whole affair have come from Sven himself: \"It is a nonsense.\"</p>",
  "<p>The European Commission yesterday accused global credit card and payment system company Visa International of breaching EU competition rules by refusing to admit American bank Morgan Stanley to its network in Europe. </p> <p>Visa, an unlisted grouping of 21,000 banks and financial services providers, retorted that it was defending competition by denying a direct competitor access to its proprietary information. </p> <p>A statement from the commission said the decision by Visa to bar the American investment bank from its network of connected shops and merchants in the EU because it operated the rival Discover card in the United States was discriminatory. </p> <p>Owners of several other payment card schemes had been admitted as Visa members - notably Citigroup, which owns the global Diners Club network. </p> <p>\"The commission is concerned that this Visa membership rule is not applied in an objective and non-dis criminatory manner vis-a-vis all applicants for Visa membership,\" it said. </p> <p>\"Visa has failed to explain why a global network such as Diners Club, which operates in over 200 countries including Europe, should be less of a threat to Visa than a regional network like Discover, which operates only in the US and does not have any presence in Europe,\" it said. </p> <p>David Masters, a spokesman for Visa International in London, said that since Morgan Stanley operated a rival credit card, \"any decision that allows them access to proprietary Visa information will inevitably reduce competition between payment systems\". </p> <p>Visa has three months to respond to the commission's concerns and can request an oral hearing.</p>",

  "If you spend much time in Dudley in the West Midlands, it is difficult to miss the zoo. It stands on a steep wooded hill, the steepest for miles, a freakish island of green among the roundabouts and redbrick and former factories. Inside the zoo, the outside world soon recedes. The chatter of the enclosures replaces the growl of traffic. The occasional keeper passes, looking deeply tanned and calm. Animals chew and stare. Paths for visitors curl and divide and disappear into the shadows. <p>Not even the keepers, some of who live inside the perimeter fence, claim to know everything that goes on in the zoo, especially after closing time. So when, first thing one morning in April, they found one of the zoo's half dozen wallabies with a broken leg, they were not immediately suspicious. \"It was quite a severe break,\" says the zoo's curator, Matthew Lewis, \"but it could have been thunder that spooked them.\" It had been raining hard in Dudley the day before. \"Or it could have been a fight between the wallabies; a dominance thing.\" </p> <p>There were also signs, though, that outside the wallaby enclosure, litter bins had been moved. Foxes were known to roam the zoo at night, even to leap into the animal pens - the fence around the wallabies had recently been raised and partly electrified to prevent this - but foxes were not strong enough to roll over the heavy bins. So the keepers set up a video camera a discreet distance from the wallabies, and trained it on their enclosure. </p> <p>For a fortnight, nothing unusual was recorded. The injured wallaby was put down. Taking it away from the group for treatment was impractical, says Lewis matter-of-factly. \"The others would probably have rejected it.\" </p> <p>Then, on the morning of May 6, the keepers found the youngest wallaby, a five-month-old baby, lying in the small shed inside the enclosure where the group sheltered at night. It was soaked, muddy and dead. Outside the enclosure, the bins had been moved again. One had been rolled 50 metres uphill and placed upright beside the only section of the enclosure that was not electrified. The keepers took a look at the previous day's video tapes. </p> <p>They saw three small bony boys in baseball caps and hoods. Just before seven o'clock in the evening, an hour and a half after the zoo had closed, the boys walked casually up to the bin beside the wallaby enclosure, exchanged a few words, and climbed up and over. The footage was crude but two details were unmistakable: the boys' complete lack of furtiveness, and a fluency to their movements that showed they had done this before. </p> <p>Last month, two of the boys, both 11 years old, were convicted of cruelty to animals. Another boy, aged 10, who took part in the first attack on the wallabies but not the second, was also found guilty. Another boy, aged nine, who took part in the second attack, was too young to be prosecuted. Unusually for a case involving the conviction of children, the judge at Dudley Youth Court allowed the media to name the two oldest boys, citing \"the most serious form of cruelty\" performed by Ryan Jones and Kieron Anslow and their accomplices. </p> <p>The three boys found guilty were given 12-month behavioural orders and their families fined a total of \u00a31,100. Yet on leaving court, Jones and Anslow continued to play the part of amoral, uncontrollable children to perfection. Anslow, crop-haired with a precociously icy stare, gave the television cameras the finger. Jones, lankier and more excited, grinned, stuffed his mouth with food and showed no other emotions. </p> <p>In the narrow streets of Dudley, the week after the convictions, the zoo staff \"were being stopped every 100 yards,\" says Lewis, \"by people saying, 'They should hang the kids.'\" A petition against the boys was assembled. A local councillor and MP condemned them. The Home Office expressed concern. News of the wallaby killings reached Australia. On the internet, what had happened at Dudley grew from \"kicking\" and \"beating\", to \"abuse\" and \"mutilation\". A senior local police officer commented: \"Last year I dealt with eight murders in Dudley, but none of them attracted the attention this has.\" </p> <p>Yet if you talk to other people in Dudley, the sense of outrage is undercut a little by an admission. Breaking into the zoo is something of a local tradition. \"Listen to the old folk round here and they say everyone was at it,\" says Peter Suddock, the zoo's chief executive. \"It was a dare to get into the zoo over the fences at seven o'clock at night. We've all done things like that.\" In the early evening, the animals are at their most watchable and active and the dimming paths and enclosures at their most atmospheric - and there are other, less high-minded temptations. \"We've had children try to break into kiosks, take ice creams, trash things,\" says Lewis. \"They're crafty little buggers. They climb the trees to get in.\" </p> <p>Two years ago, razor wire was added to Dudley zoo's perimeter fence. But defending the maze of enclosures against all intruders is impossible. The zoo's resources are limited: it is almost 70 years old, and sections of it are showing their age or closed off altogether. In 2000, a dwarf crocodile was stolen. In 2001, two baby wallabies were snatched, again by children (not Anslow and Jones and their accomplices), who smashed through glass to reach them, again shortly after closing time. Those wallabies were found unharmed by police. No arrests followed. \"The children wanted them as pets,\" says Suddock. \"They didn't do anything to them.\" </p> <p>The story of this year's wallaby break-ins does not have the same children's story glow to it. All three of the boys convicted come from Kates Hill, a suburb near the centre of Dudley. Dudley is not a rich town - its heavy industry is gone, the shops in the centre are frugal or boarded-up - and Kates Hill is its most deprived area. Worn-looking semis and newer but neglected-looking council blocks cover a steep slope with lots of open space but few facilities. Boys hang around on bicycles, kick footballs without having a football pitch, sit on walls. Dudley police say Kates Hill has less crime than other parts of town, but in the local papers it has acquired a reputation for disorder regardless, particularly involving children and teenagers. </p> <p>At court, Anslow's mother said that her son had been mixing with a \"bad crowd\". The mother of the 10-year-old said the same. But the owner of one of the few shops on Kates Hill says that before the attacks on the wallabies, he thought of the three boys who would later be convicted as basically harmless. \"The kids seemed all right. I saw them every day when they came in to buy sweets. They respected me as the shop owner.\" </p> <p>Other people on the estate describe the boys, who are friends and go to the same school (which cannot be identified), in less benign terms. But they are keen not to be quoted. Only a few other facts about the boys escape these legal and social pressures to maintain their privacy. Anslow lives with his mother and four younger siblings. At court, his defence said his public manner was deceptive: at home he helped look after the family pets and give his youngest sibling a bottle. </p> <p>Jones also lives with his mother. He has five siblings, two of them with disabilities. The headmistress of his school was reportedly surprised as well as shocked when she heard what he and the others had done to the wallabies. </p> <p>On both occasions, the boys climbed the zoo perimeter a long way from their enclosure. From what the keepers can tell, and from the contradictory accounts the boys gave the police, the boys went straight to the wallabies. Once they got into the enclosure, they acted with increasing calculation. The first time, they drove the wallabies out of their night shelter by opening its tiny doors and banging on the sides of the shed. Then they chased the animals round their rectangular pen, about the size of half a tennis court, with its small bushes and trees and damp gravel. </p> <p>Wallabies can move fast and turn tight corners. But they are small - Dudley's are Parma wallabies, the smallest and most endangered kind, about the weight of a cat - and they are not frightening. \"If you pick them up by the tail, they can't do anything,\" Lewis says. The boys ran after the wallabies until they \"looked sad\" and were breathing heavily, then left the zoo the way they had come. </p> <p>The second time, they pulled up fencing that had been protecting the bushes in the wallaby enclosure, and used it to herd the animals into a corner. Then they picked up the smallest by the tail and threw it into the next enclosure, where there was a small concrete-lined pond. The baby wallaby \"needed a wash\", the boys decided, so they forced it in and out of the greenish water. It was a cold evening, but the boys stayed with the wallabies for 45 minutes. At some point the baby died, probably of shock. The boys put it back in the wallabies' night shelter, climbed out of the enclosure, and were found by the keepers on the other side of the zoo, rattling the fence round the lions. </p> <p>Cruelty to animals, at least of the informal kind, is a dark and tentatively explored subject. \"There's a paucity of evidence as to the psychology,\" says Michael Thrusfield of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh. His papers on animal abuse draw few conclusions, except that households that are violent in other ways are more likely to be involved, and that children are also \"over-represented\" among those who attack animals. \"You've only got to go down to a duck pond to see toddlers chasing ducks.\" </p> <p>Such actions are partly about power. In zoos, where animals are controlled so visibly, it may be that one sort of domination leads to another. Or it may be that cruelty is just one of many impulses triggered by the strange and suggestive environment of a zoo. In 2002, a teenager broke into Newquay zoo in Cornwall one night and tried to feed ice creams to the lions. Two years earlier, a rare type of lobster was stolen from the same zoo and its crate found beside the remains of a beach barbecue. </p> <p>In Dudley, one of the main pieces of evidence against the boys who attacked the wallabies was that they had bragged in front of one of Kates Hill's community policemen about how \"funny\" it was to have \"killed a kangaroo\". But now there is guarded optimism among those overseeing the programme to improve their behaviour: the boys are attending \"restorative\" meetings with the zoo staff, and are to do weekly menial tasks there as compensation. \"The kids want to get back to being kids again,\" says the head of Dudley's youth offending service, Mark Galikowski. It is best to interpret that positively.</p>",
  "<p>Old folklore has dragons soaring around the Swiss Alps and, while there's not been a sighting of one for a while, the locals are still very keen on finding ways to get a dragon's eye view.</p> <p>In Interlaken, a pretty tourist town that sits between lakes Thun and Brienz in the Bernese Oberland region, paragliding is the answer. You can't quite terrorise the town in the same way as if you were riding a dragon, but the view is just as magical. Strapped into my harness, by turns terrified and exhilarated, I was particularly taken with the view of the rivers, which, because of glacial minerals, are a fairytale turquoise. </p> <p>Paragliding is a quiet ride; quiet enough anyway for me to hear my pilot, Roland Wyss, tell me how children as young as three do it, and how he recently flew with someone with no legs. The clear subtext to all this being that I have no excuse for not being brave. </p> <p>In the van going up to the large hill where we were about to take-off from (which is a 20-minute drive from Interlaken), I read the legal disclaimer and try to settle my butterflies. \"We will not be serving drinks and snacks,\" jokes one of the pilots. </p> <p>But my anxieties are mostly settled after being reassured that it did not involve any freefall, confirmed by watching another paraglider take off. Strapped in with your pilot behind you, you then have to run a little down the steep grassy bank while the pilot gets the parachute up and catches the wind. Before you know it, your legs are kicking through thin air and you are soaring into the sky, high on the Alpine breeze and the ridiculous beauty of the view.</p> <p>There are a dozen other paragliders in the sky around us and I'm a little nervous about colliding into one as I try to get a handle on how much control Roland has. Later he takes us apparently straight towards a cliff and I worry before he changes direction and we sail past it. When we're quite close to some trees he says: \"When I'm up here with friends I sometimes try to see if I can grab a pine cone.\" </p> <p>So I figure he must have good control. He offers to let me \"fly\" for a couple of moments but I must faithfully report that I bottled it. </p> <p>Roland explains how he looks down for clues about where the thermals might be. You can tell by a branch moving in the wind, or the arc of an alpine bird. </p> <p>Then he asks if I want us to do some tricks - going into his repertoire before I get a chance to speak. He starts to show me one where he goes down like a corkscrew and you can really feel the g-force. Then there's another one that dips you up and down like a rollercoaster. My stomach is quite full of Swiss cheese, so I ask him to take it steady. \"No problem,\" Roland says, although I know he's probably itching to do more stunt flying. Rather wistfully, he points out a paraglider who is coming down from a nearby mountain.</p> <p>All the main paragliders in the area take part in competitions and he tells me they sometimes do night flights. \"We can put lights on. And it's not like anyone can really stop you, or know about it. There's no noise or other kind of pollution.\"</p> <p>Roland takes some amazing pictures using customised cameras on long metal \"l-shaped\" rods. One tip - if you get motion sickness take a pre-flight tablet. One of our group succumbed, but informed his pilot who thanked him and gave him a bag. \"Mostly people are just sick and it hits us in the face,\" the pilot said. </p> <p>The length of the flight depends on how good the thermals are but might be around 10 to 15 minutes. We land very gently on the green in Interlaken, opposite its poshest hotel, the Victoria-Jungfrau (Queen Victoria used to like her Swiss holidays).</p> <p>Roland says he's done between 3,000 and 3,500 flights. \"There are 30,000 paragliding pilots in Switzerland, so there are probably more than a million flights a year and only about three fatal accidents. So it is very safe - there's not much that can go wrong. You're definitely more likely to get hurt crossing the road,\" he told us.</p> <p>A recent survey found that paragliding, white water rafting, glacier hiking, parachuting and bungee-jumping were among the top 50 things that people wanted to do before they die. So that's five things you can chalk off that top 50 list in a few days in the region. Interlaken itself is alive in the summer with tourists coming for the adventure sports. The town has managed to get itself on the US backpacker trail, and it's also very popular with South Koreans. </p> <p>Our group also went white water rafting, which was fantastic. You may detect a theme emerging here, but I was slightly terrified before we set off, when we were getting instructions on how best to avoid drowning if we went in (and what to do if the raft ends up on top of you and everything has gone dark). </p> <p>But after you've had a few rapids come crashing over the boat, you start to get the measure of it. We did a 15km stretch of the Lutschine river going into a lake, which was around a three or four strength river out of the five grades they use to classify rafting. The rafting was organised by <a href=\"http://www.alpinraft.ch\">Alpin Raft</a>, whose adventure-junkie instructors thanked us for coming so they \"didn't have to get real jobs\". The firm run a backpacking hostel - full of young Americans - and do an array of adventure sports including canyoning, bungee-jumping, ice climbing, as well as kayaking and horse trekking. There are also firms that do zorbing, where you are put in a big plastic ball and rolled down a hill while trying not to feel silly. </p> <p>Interlaken is also a good place to go mountain biking. There is a very beautiful route from the town along Lake Thun as well as opportunities to get up higher and do downhill riding. Our group included Dave Wardell, who is the UK's fourth best mountain biker, on a shoot for <a href=\"http://www.mbuk.com/\">Mountain Biking UK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.4130.com/4130.html\">Dirt Video</a>. Then there was me, who has barely ever been on a bike, but the tour operators Base Camp found routes for all levels. So while Dave was doing mad tricks and accelerating downhill, I had the brakes permanently on. </p> <p>If you want to take a break from the adrenaline sports then you can go on a great sightseeing trip on Europe's highest railway. Jungfrau railways takes you by cogwheel train up to the top of the Jungfrau, one of the highest mountains in the Alps. Much of the six-mile route to the top is through a tunnel; with a stop to look out through an observation window in the Eiger.</p> <p>Then you get to the Jungfraujoch complex at the top of the Jungfrau where there is an ice palace cut out of the glacier, restaurants and an observation area where on a clear day you can see as far as other peaks in France and Germany. </p> <p>While you're at the top you may also encounter these really cool birds, which are black with yellow beaks. After some Google-based research I find out the birds were Alpine choughs noted for being \"gregarious and fearless\" - definitely the right characteristics for a stay in Switzerland. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Mark flew with <a href=\" http://www.swiss.com/\">Swiss International Air Lines</a> from Heathrow to Zurich (which costs \u00a375 for an economy return) and then on to Interlaken by rail. </p> <p>A four-day <a href=\"http://www.raileurope.com/us/rail/passes/swiss_pass.htm\">Swiss pass</a> for unlimited first-class travel on the railways, lake steamers and buses throughout the country costs around \u00a3140. </p> <p>Mark stayed at the <a href=\"http://www.hotel-dunord.ch/Acceuil.html\">Hotel du Nord</a>, a homely four-star hotel in the middle of the town. </p> <p>The paraglide was 150 Swiss francs (around \u00a365) with Alpine Centre based in Interlaken and there are a handful of other firms.</p>",
  "<p>Several years ago, on a damp, dour Sunday, I was tired, disillusioned and uninspired, wandering a glum Aberdeen after a long shift as a junior doctor. The fingers of serendipity, however, gently pointed towards the art gallery door, where an exhibition of the work of Angus McPhee was on display. I had never heard of him. A crofter's son, he had died, aged 81, in 1997, and had been virtually mute for 50 years as an in-patient at a psychiatric hospital in Inverness. </p> <p>There were boots - fragile, woven in grass; a vest - perfectly netted together with commas of sheep wool, caught on fences, taken and spun by Angus between his fingers. And sandals - a cushion of beech leaves embellished with a strap of twisted grass. There were hats - wide- brimmed sunhats and others in the Davy Crockett style; there were leads and harnesses for ponies, socks, waders and jumpers. All at once they seemed simple, complex, pointless, glorious. </p> <p>McPhee's work was discovered by Joyce Laing, an art therapist who has been searching for what she calls \"artists extraordinary\" for the last 35 years.\"It means someone who is in touch with their subconscious,\" she says. \"And although you don't have to have a mental illness to be an artist extraordinary, it is vanishingly rare outside of it.\" </p> <p>Without formal training and cultural conditioning, and outside easy categorisation, the French artist Jean Dubuffet is credited with first seeking \"art brut\", as he called it, as he searched for uninhibited raw expression in art. While Laing classes William Blake and Gaudi as artists extraordinary, she stresses that mental illness does not necessarily give anyone a particular gift in art: \"It is rare, as rare as artists are in the general public.\" In her 35-year search, she has found around 20 extraordinary, or \"outsider\" - a term she dislikes - artists. </p> <p>Laing glows as she recalls her discovery of McPhee. A trained art therapist, she had been given a tiny grant to research these artists. She took a taxi from the railway station to Craig Dunain hospital in Inverness. The driver turned out to be a former nurse, and when Joyce asked him if he had ever seen any memorable art by a patient, he slammed on the brakes. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"There was a man who made things out of grass.\" But he could not remember which part of the hospital he was in. </p> <p>Craig Dunain is a huge, sprawling hospital, and when she found McPhee, Laing could scarcely believe the trove he showed her, hidden under holly bushes in the bottom of the garden. When she asked for permission to take some items and put them on display in a gallery, McPhee - to her surprise - signed his name in copper plate. Despite having been able to speak before he became unwell, he had been mute since being admitted to hospital. </p> <p>Angus was born on Uist in the Outer Hebrides, and signed up to the Lovat Scouts, a Highland regiment, at the onset of the second world war. He was sent to the Faroe Islands for military service but became ill. He initially seemed to recover but relapsed shortly afterwards. He was taken to Craig Dunain, where he remained for half a century. </p> <p>While long stays such as this in psychiatric units would be highly unusual today, then it was commonplace, and there was little choice of effective medication. However, McPhee would not have been idle. He was assigned to the \"farm ward\", and worked on the land. With grasses, leaves and wool at his fingertips, he began to create. </p> <p>Dr David Tait, consultant psychotherapist at Murray Royal Hospital in Perth, has seen at first hand the effect of art therapy on recovery and wellbeing. \"Art therapy reaches the parts that other psychotherapies can't reach. Imagery can bring into consciousness previously unacknowledged or inaccessible feelings and thoughts.\" </p> <p>While most art therapy will not be outsider, or extraordinary art, it may well be a source of it. \"Art takes away the feeling that just because you're a patient you can't do anything,\" says Tait. \"Once you have started to create something, there are great benefits to self-esteem, and limits to what you can achieve break down.\" </p> <p>Within Murray Royal, Tait and his art therapist colleague set up an open studio, and called it The Art Factory as a tribute to Andy Warhol. They organised an exhibition of patients' work at the Royal College of Psychiatrists' annual conference last year. </p> <p>However supportive and encouraging psychiatrists are of art therapy, though, there are conflicts. Says Laing: \"Some artists do complain about being on medication: why try to make me 'normal'? These are big questions for psychiatry.\" </p> <p>Tait agrees that there are difficulties: \"There is no such thing as a side-effect-free drug. Any medication has costs and benefits. While some individuals may feel blunted by their medication, for others it is a liberation from the private, personal hell of ill-health, and in turn creativity can re-emerge.\" </p> <p>While art therapy may be useful for many people with mental illness, Laing does not believe that art therapy has much to offer an outsider artist. \"You see artists at college sketching, then looking at their work, discussing it. Artists extraordinary never look at what they are doing. I'm one of the few people who have had access to work with extraordinary artists. When they finish it, they just get up and walk away, and if you say are you going to finish it?, they say, I am on to something else. They know when to stop.\" </p> <p>While no artist whose work Laing has dealt with has objected to their art being displayed, none, in her experience, has ever come to see their own exhibition. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the public receive the art differently. When McPhee's work is shown, Laing says that people stay longer compared with other contemporary art spaces, ask more questions, and comment more in visitor's books. In Dublin, the Irish Museum of Modern Art holds the Musgrave Kinley Outsider Art Collection on permanent loan, which contains more than 600 works. Internationally, one of Art Newspaper's most visited shows last year was an exhibition of the work of John the Painter - a pseudonym that preserves the anonymity of the Irish artist, who has been ill for many years. </p> <p>Confidentiality is a sensitive area. Both Tait and Laing stress the need to get clear permission to display works of art, which in many cases are signed by the artist, and Tait has run workshops on this topic. In addition, the artist must be fully capable of giving consent. Laing speaks of her reticence in taking works from McPhee, even with his permission, although he had burned most of his work along with the autumn leaves each winter. \"I regret not having rescued more,\" she says. </p> <p>Despite the popularity of the work, Laing has been unable to obtain funding for a permanent exhibition space. While it will be shown as part of the Pittenweem arts festival - in the tiny Fife coastal village next week - it will be viewed only by appointment after that. So why should we care? \"Art is about our humanity, and producing art lets us all, including our patients, share in this\" says Tait. There should be a place to exhibit all genres, and it seems bizarre that there is no permanent outsider art collection in the UK.\" </p> <p>I agree. It is difficult to say what Angus McPhee's work showed me, but I am richer for having seen it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Angus McPhee's work can be seen August 7-15 at the Old Manse, High Street, Pittenweem; <a href=\"http://www.pittenweemartsfestival.co.uk.\">www.pittenweemartsfestival.co.uk.</a> Exhibitions of Outsider Art can be seen in the Mexico Gallery, 6 Fleet Road, London NW3 020-7485 6577.

  "<p>A leading TB consultant has warned an \"inexorable rise\" in tuberculosis will continue unless more specialist nurses are put in place.</p> <p>London is now a TB \"hotspot\" with nearly half of all UK cases occurring in the capital - around 3,000 each year - double the total of 15 years ago. </p> <p>TB cases have jumped by nearly 20% in England and Wales over the last two years, but London in particular is under threat from the bacterial disease, which is more commonly found in developing countries. </p> <p>Immigration, overcrowding and the spread of HIV infection have all contributed to the resurgence of TB in the UK. </p> <p>TB is a contagious airborne bacterial disease of the respiratory system which causes severe lung symptoms, but can often be present without causing any symptoms until the patient becomes run down or the immune system is damaged. </p> <p>The disease can usually be treated by a six-month course of drugs, but in many developing nations it can prove to be fatal due to a lack of medical care, a failure to complete treatment, and a combination of other diseases. </p> <p>An audit of high incidence TB areas in 43 districts across England and Wales carried out last year by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) found that nearly 90% of them had insufficient staff to cope with such a high prevalence rate. </p> <p>Dr Vas Novelli, head consultant on infectious diseases at Great Ormond Street hospital, London, which is running a new monthly TB clinic in response to the steep rise in cases, called on the government to pump more cash into improving TB services. </p> <p>Two of the main problems, he said, are that certain strains of TB are becoming resistant to many drugs, and that the number of specialists falls far short of current recommendations. </p> <p>\"Whilst screening for TB in high-risk groups has always been a priority, TB is not always picked up immediately, and we are now facing multi-drug resistant strains of TB in the capital\".</p> <p>Dr Novelli said: \"The current numbers of TB clinical nurse specialists also fall dramatically short of (BTS) Joint Tuberculosis Committee recommendations that there should be one nurse for every 40 TB patients. </p> <p>\"Unless the numbers of TB nurses are increased we will continue to see an inexorable rise in TB cases in London.\" </p> <p>Areas worst-hit by TB such as Newham and Tower Hamlets should be a top priority for recruiting more specialist nurses in order to better screen and keep track of TB patients and ensure they are taking their medication, he said. </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said it was \"well aware\" that a small number of areas of the country were seeing TB cases rising. </p> <p>\"Primary care trusts are responsible for delivering TB services appropriate for their population and a huge amount of action is already under way across the country\", she said. </p> <p>The spokeswoman added: \"The chief medical officer identified the need for more intense action and that is why we have been preparing a TB action plan for England, which will be published in the autumn.\"</p> <p>Main findings:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The BTS reported a rise in TB cases in England and Wales from 5,798 in 1992 to 6,891 in 2002.

  "The \"devastated\" husband of a young bride shot dead in her home has appealed for information. <p>Lee Taylor said he was in a \"complete state of shock\" at the murder of hairdresser Chanel, 23, who was found shot in the head in Nottinghamshire. </p> <p>The father of the newlywed, Terence Rodgers, who gave her away seven weeks ago, is being hunted by police who have warned the public not to approach him. </p> <p>Mr Rodgers, 55, had been living with the couple in Huthwaite, Sutton in Ashfield, for several weeks but has not been seen since his daughter's body was discovered. </p> <p>Detectives later found Mr Rodgers' red Peugeot 106 abandoned in Hucknall, Nottingham. </p> <p>Mr Taylor, 24, said: \"We were a newly married couple and I am devastated with regard to the death of my wife, Chanel. </p> <p>\"We were very happy and looking forward to a long life together. Tragically this will no longer happen. At this time I am in a complete state of shock and I request that my family and I be left alone to grieve.</p> <p>\"I would ask anyone with any information to contact police.\" </p> <p>The couple married at Mansfield register office on June 12 and went on a honeymoon to Cancun, Mexico, before returning to their terraced home to live with Chanel's father. </p> <p>Police discovered the body of Chanel at the house at around 1pm on Friday after a telephone tip-off. </p> <p>Reports said neighbours heard a row at the house on Thursday night followed by a couple of loud bangs. </p> <p>Inspector Barry Harper, of Nottinghamshire police, said: \"Although we have recovered Mr Rodgers' car, there have been no sightings of him in person and, as time goes on, we are becoming increasingly concerned for his welfare. </p> <p>\"Although he is a local man with knowledge of the area, we are keeping an open mind as to where he may be. </p> <p>\"As Mr Rodgers was living at the address prior to the incident we believe he must have vital information and we need to speak him as an urgent priority. </p> <p>\"Police are making a direct plea to Mr Rodgers to come forward and help us with our inquiries.\" </p> <p>Mr Rodgers is described as white, 5ft 10ins and stocky, with a shaved head. </p> <p>He has tattoos of a flower on his right forearm and a dagger and the name Christine on his left forearm. </p> <p>A Nottinghamshire police spokeswoman said that no murder weapon had been found. </p> <p>Anyone with information should contact the incident room on 0115 9670999 ext 2742/2743, or alternatively ring Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555111.</p>",
  "<p>Sudan is becoming a dark study in disillusion. Only two weeks ago, Britain was openly hinting at military intervention to end the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region. In an echo of the build-up to war in Iraq, Tony Blair spoke gravely of a \"moral responsibility\" that must not be shirked. </p> <p>Not to be outdone, Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, warned of dire consequences should the Islamist-led Sudanese government fail to fulfil its undertakings to the United Nations. He demanded an immediate end to a conflict that has cost an estimated 30,000 lives (there are no wholly reliable figures) and displaced more than 1 million people. </p> <p>The clamour to \"do something\" - and quickly - became a crescendo as the UN, development officials and aid agencies warned of a catastrophe in Darfur and in the refugee camps in neighbouring Chad. </p> <p>Anxious to have its say before going on holiday, the US Congress grabbed some headlines of its own by labelling as genocide the mayhem perpetrated by Janjaweed Arab nomad militias. </p> <p>Serious stuff indeed. So what happened? Did the B52s scramble? Did Nato volunteer to go \"out of area\"? Did Pentagon supremo Donald Rumsfeld rally the \"new\" (as opposed to \"old\") Africa to confront what the US deems a terrorism-sponsoring state of concern? </p> <p>Not exactly. After all that noisy talk, the UN security council met last week and passed a motion. </p> <p>The Sudanese government was given 30 days to call off its proxy killers or face unspecified punitive \"measures\" - but, mark well, not formal sanctions, not military force and certainly not a regime-changing invasion. And that only if the UN deemed the government to have made insufficient progress by September. </p> <p>Khartoum's militia puppet-masters were, in effect, let off the hook. They now say they will comply to the best of their ability - but want 90 days rather than 30 to do so, as previously agreed with the UN boss, Kofi Annan. </p> <p>Even this conditional acceptance is hedged with qualifiers. For Sudanese ministers also claim that they do not control the Janjaweed, who (they say) may be impossible to rein in. </p> <p>And they warn that implementing the UN resolution in full, including assisted resettlement of displaced people and the resumption of a political dialogue in Darfur, will be \"extremely difficult\" in so short a timeframe. After over a century of foreign interference and post-independence neglect, disputes over customary water and land use, and growing ethnic and tribal tensions in Darfur, that contention has a ring of truth. </p> <p>But it also seems clear that Khartoum plans to play for time. The government is likely to exhibit only limited compliance with UN demands while waiting for the international hubbub to die down and for some new political and media sensation to shift attention elsewhere. </p> <p>That, after all, is how it has always been in Sudan since the 19th century joustings of Ismail Pasha, the Mahdi and Herbert (later Lord) Kitchener. In the end, everybody tends to walk away from Sudan, somewhat baffled, lances a trifle bent. It is just too big and too complicated. </p> <p>Sudan's present-day leader, Omar al-Bashir, may not be the smartest bean in the box. But he probably calculates that Mr Blair, for all his moral conviction, has a lot of other fish to fry. The prime minister surely cares. But he is no Charles \"Chinese\" Gordon, the British general killed in the siege of Khartoum in 1885 after refusing a way out. </p> <p>Similar calculations also suggest that George Bush, in a neck-and-neck autumn US election race, will avoid a post-Iraq adventure overseas. It smacks too much of Somalia, his father's parting folly in 1992-93. Nor will his hyper-cautious Democratic challenger, John Kerry, push for intervention. </p> <p>And what if the UN does move towards punitive \"measures\" this autumn? Russia or China, with oil and commercial interests in mind, may veto them. </p> <p>But even if they do not, such restrictions would make little difference to Khartoum's already isolated leadership - although ordinary people could suffer. The US, for example, already has bilateral sanctions in place. </p> <p>So far the only concrete western military move has been the deployment of French troops along the Sudan-Chad border. </p> <p>Such manoeuvring may make President Jacques Chirac, a rival to Mr Blair in Africa as in so much else, feel like a player. But like the British, and indeed like the EU's nascent military organisation, the French do not have the numbers, the gear or the logistical reach to make a real difference. </p> <p>There is something depressingly familiar in international affairs about this sequence of events, this transition from brave words and high principles to shabby compromises and receding expectations. </p> <p>\"These atrocities [in Sudan] will continue,\" fumed a Washington Post editorial at the weekend. \"And yet outsiders are content with measures that won't stop the appalling suffering. How to explain this numbness?\" </p> <p>In truth, the west's behaviour to date is the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt's old maxim about speaking softly and carrying a big stick. </p> <p>On Darfur, it transpires, western leaders are all hat and no cattle (perhaps that should be camels).</p>",
  "<p>Sudan's armed forces yesterday described the UN resolution on Darfur as \"a declaration of war\" and warned that any foreign intervention in the region would be fought \"on land, sea and air\". </p> <p>The armed forces spokes-man, General Muhammad Bashir Suleiman, raised tensions by speaking of a jihad against the \"enemies of Sudan\". </p> <p>\"The security council resolution about the Darfur issue is a declaration of war on Sudan and its people,\" he told the official al-Anbaa newspaper. </p> <p>\"The door of the jihad is still open and if it has been closed in the south it will be opened in Darfur,\" he said, referring to a peace deal which has ended the 21-year civil war in southern Sudan. </p> <p>The UN resolution on Darfur, which was passed on Friday, gave the Sudanese government 30 days to disarm the predominantly Arab Janjaweed militias whose campaign of murder, rape and arson has driven more than a million people from their homes. </p> <p>Tony Blair is looking at options for sending British troops to Sudan, to support the relief effort or to help protect refugee camps from militia attacks. </p> <p>The Sudanese government is critical of the resolution, and has said it prefers to stick to a deal it signed with the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, last month, which allows Sudan 90 days to disarm the Janjaweed. </p> <p>Gen Suleiman claimed yesterday that the 30-day deadline in the UN resolution was \"a preparatory period\" for war against Sudan, which he said was \"being targeted by foreign powers\". </p> <p>He called on the Sudanese media to prepare the country for \"an unconventional warfare\". \"We will not welcome the Americans with flowers or white flags,\" the general said. </p> <p>The general was also critical of the west's use of the word Janjaweed, which he described as part of a psychological war against Sudan. </p> <p>Janjaweed is a word traditionally used in Darfur to refer to criminals, although the victims of militia attacks have adopted it to refer to the government-backed paramilitary groups which drove them from their villages. </p> <p>This double meaning has given rise to confusion. After western leaders called for the Janjaweed to be disarmed, Sudanese officials responded by rounding up bandits and putting their militia units into army or police uniforms. </p> <p>Sudan's government, whose relations with the US and Britain reached their nadir in 1998 when President Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack on Khartoum, is deeply suspicious of western intentions. </p> <p>It claims that the crisis in Darfur has been exaggerated by the western media to embarrass an Arab government. </p> <p>Sudan's foreign minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, recently claimed the pressure put on his country \"closely resembles the increased pressure that was put on Iraq\" in the run-up to war. At the weekend, he hinted that the UN resolution had been passed because of the pending US elections. </p> <p>There are an estimated 1.2 million internal refugees in Darfur and 120,000 who have crossed the border into Chad. Every day, between 30 and 100 new refugees arrive on the Chad border. The displaced families are short of food. </p> <p>Some aid worker sources estimate that the UN's food distributions cover between a third and half of what is needed.</p>",
  "A black woman whose colleagues referred to her desk as \"Robben Island\" while she worked in the most politically sensitive unit of the Home Office's immigration and nationality directorate (IND) has won her claim of racial discrimination. <p>An employment tribunal unanimously ruled that the Home Office discriminated against Devaline McKenzie after hearing that senior officials had failed to investigate her claims of bullying and harassment over two years. </p> <p>Ms McKenzie worked in the immigration service's ministerial cases unit in Croydon, which deals with decisions in which ministers and MPs have declared an interest. Ms McKenzie, 38, from Norwood, south London, told the tribunal she felt \"humiliated and victimised\" by her managers and a staff member who was supposed to be her mentor. </p> <p>She said she faced bullying on a regular basis. She was told that she was too young to be a mother and \"must have been 12\" when she gave birth to her daughter. Her desk at the Croydon headquarters was referred to by other staff as Robben Island, the South African apartheid prison where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated.</p> <p>\"The senior managers happily referred to my desk as Robben Island, claiming they did so as a representation of freedom, when Nelson Mandela was freed from that prison. I found it highly insulting to discover that the area in which I worked was being referred to as Robben Island and it was clear that this was a derogatory reference towards myself.\"</p> <p>Ms McKenzie told the tribunal that a female colleague publicly belittled her and continually made changes to her work, culminating in an \"outburst of insults\" when she was asked to draft a response to a parliamentary question.</p> <p>Her immediate managers tried to persuade her to drop her complaints against their colleague. She said she was made to feel like the instigator rather than the victim. She was given hospital treatment for stress-related pain in her legs and asked for a transfer from the Croydon office because she could not cope with the harassment.</p> <p>But senior Home Office officials refused to consider the request and failed to investigate her allegations. She felt ostracised by her colleagues. </p> <p>\"I was extremely shocked by the attitude being taken at such a high level of management. I had raised issues which had affected my ability to work at Croydon and were affecting my psychological health. Despite this, the Home Office was unwilling to investigate the matter properly.\" </p> <p>Eventually Ms McKenzie learned that she had been replaced while she was off sick due to depression. </p> <p>The London South employment tribunal unanimously ruled that the Home Office had discriminated against Ms McKenzie on racial grounds. </p> <p>Shah Qureshi, her solicitor, said: \"The tribunal was scathing in its judgment. There seemed to be collusion at local level to prevent Devaline pursuing her grievances despite the serious nature of the allegations. There was a closed shop which led to institutional racism within IND at Croydon, yet senior management failed to address this for over two years.\"</p> <p>A decision on the amount of compensation was reserved.</p>",
  "Six years ago, the American sociologist Alan Wolfe published a strikingly important book. Entitled One Nation, After All, and subtitled What Middle-Class Americans Really Think About, it is an essential text for understanding the pulse of modern America. What makes it both important and essential is that Wolfe painted a picture radically at odds with the exaggerated perception, both in the US and abroad, of America as a nation of entrenched and embattled ideological extremes. <p>In fact, Wolfe argued that middle America was not so much a land of culture wars as of cultural pragmatism. \"I have found little support for the notion that middle-class Americans\" - a category within which three quarters of all Americans define themselves - \"are engaged in bitter cultural conflict with each other over the proper way to live,\" he observed. </p> <p>\"Reluctant to pass judgment, [Americans] are tolerant to a fault,\" he concluded. \"Not about everything - they have not come to accept homosexuality as normal and they intensely dislike bilingualism - but about a surprising number of things, including rapid transformations in the family, legal immigration, multicultural education and the separation of church and state. Above all moderate in their outlook on the world, they believe in the importance of leading a virtuous life, but are reluctant to impose values they understand as virtuous for themselves on others; strong believers in morality, they do not want to be considered moralists.\" </p> <p>Wolfe's book came out at the height of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and his findings were vindicated by the response of public opinion to the president's misdemeanours. While Republican fanatics used the affair to try to drive the president from the White House, moderate middle America failed to rise to their bait. Instead they kept Clinton's wrongdoings in proportion and rallied behind him, just as a reading of Wolfe's book suggested they might. </p> <p>But that was then. Today, in election year, the talk is of a deeply divided nation, of a Disraelian Two Americas, to quote the title of a recent book by the pollster Stanley Greenberg. Six years on, in the wake of the split-down-the-middle presidential election of November 2000, in the light of the ideological drivings of the Bush administration and, above all, in the confrontational aftermath of Iraq, how does Wolfe's late-1990s vision of a tolerant consensual America stand up? </p> <p>When I put this question to him last week, Wolfe argued that the past four years have confirmed rather than destroyed the essential thesis of his book. By any standard, he reckons, Americans are less divided in their view of life, the nation and the world, than they were in the past. One nation, after all, again. </p> <p>The essence of Wolfe's case is that the great wedge issues of the late 20th-century culture wars have simply shrunk in significance. The most important of these, as always, is affirmative action on race, where the supreme court has managed to strike a sensible compromise. Nor, he argues, does abortion still have the divisive potential of the past, though if a re-elected Bush attempts to nominate a supreme court dedicated to overturning the landmark pro-abortion Roe vs Wade judgment of 1973, that could change. Having won the political argument over what it calls partial birth abortion, though, Wolfe reckons the right is less angry than it was. </p> <p>There's much about America in 2004 that bears this out. Over the past couple of months, the president has spent $50m on campaign ads designed to promote his opposition to gay marriage. As Wolfe's original research found, gay equality remains one of the issues on which middle America remains to be convinced; yet you would have to search long and hard to find many people who believe that gay marriage is the great dividing issue in America. At the margins, Bush's advertising may help to motivate some social conservatives to vote Republican, but mostly it has sunk without trace. </p> <p>Which brings us to the paradox. If Wolfe is right, even in 2004, and most Americans are indeed part of the shared values of One America, then how does this square with an electorate that, according to most of the current opinion polling, is now so sharply polarised into Two Americas? </p> <p>A possible explanation is that the polarisation of 2000 and 2004 is simply untypical - most US presidential elections are not nearly so close as the last one was and the next one promises to be. In that case, some special factor - the disabling effect of the Clinton scandals on the Democratic cause in 2000, perhaps, or the mistrust towards Bush's Iraq policy and his tax cuts this time around - may have made these two contests more impassioned than they might otherwise have been. </p> <p>A second is that the practices of modern campaigning and media - giving voters a relentlessly inaccurate picture of the choices they face, presenting their own candidate in an unbelievably favourable light and their opponent in an equally unbelievably negative light - conspire to create a polarised contest between core electorates and to drive down participation. As US journalist Jack Germond says in his new memoir, the Republicans do not have a monopoly on such tactics - they just seem better at it. </p> <p>There is, of course, a third possibility: that Wolfe's \"one nation\" theory is just wrong. In the end, though, a complete explanation surely also involves a critical assessment of the tactics of the Democrats, in particular the intellectual defensiveness that EJ Dionne, in another necessary new book, Stand Up Fight Back, dubs \"the politics of accommodation\" and which Garry Wills, in a brilliant essay in the New York Review of Books, describes as Clinton's legacy of \"omnidirectional proneness to pusillanimity and collapse\". </p> <p>Dionne's answer has lessons not just for the Democrats but for the Labour party. His argument is that progressive parties must not be so fearful about affirming the traditions from which they come, while simultaneously recognising that the tradition is \"pragmatic, experimental and open to new approaches\". In the US, writes Dionne, this means being more explicit about government's role to help the worse off, protecting the courts from rightwing judges, reforming the campaign finance laws, promoting \"tolerant traditionalism\" in social policy while, in international affairs, adopting a vigilant optimistic \"Lockean\" strategy based on alliances, democracy and justice. </p> <p>Reading Wolfe, there is little doubt that this meshes with the \"mature patriotism\" and \"tempered internationalism\" which characterise middle-class America's view of the world and that a campaign based on such approaches would make Bush's re-election much more difficult. Will it happen? There were signs in Boston last week that John Kerry has begun to embrace some of this. But the picture is incomplete, there is a long way to go and - as Germond reminds us - the Republicans are very good, and very ruthless, campaigners. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "An important supply chain for the US forces in Iraq was disrupted yesterday when Turkish lorry owners announced that they were suspending deliveries across the border in an attempt to secure the release of two drivers being held hostage. <p>The decision to stop the 200 to 300 daily journeys was announced after the release of a videotape on an Islamist website that showed the murder of a Turkish worker in Iraq. </p> <p>The Turkish supply route is one of three relied upon by the US military and is regarded as more secure for the convoys than the routes through Jordan and Kuwait. </p> <p>Of the 2,000 lorries that cross daily from the north, about a tenth carry vital supplies such as petrol and jet fuel to American forces. </p> <p>But in the past few months several Turkish drivers have been attacked, killed or taken hostage. </p> <p>Men claiming to be from a militant group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi said on Saturday that they had captured two Turkish lorry drivers, and demanded that the men's employers leave Iraq. </p> <p>In a tape shown on the Arab satellite channel al-Jazeera, masked men threatened to behead the two drivers unless their Turkish employers complied with the kidnappers' demands. </p> <p>Militants loyal to al-Zarqawi have also claimed responsibility for a number of bloody attacks and beheadings of foreign hostages, including the US businessman Nicholas Berg, a South Korean, Kim Sun-il, and a Bulgarian truck driver, Georgi Lazov. </p> <p>A statement by the International Transporters' Association in Instanbul said: \"Within the framework of current developments, [we] decided to stop the transport of cargo which belong to the American troops in Iraq as of Monday.\" </p> <p>The association said trucks carrying supplies that were not destined to the US forces would not be affected. </p> <p>In the video broadcast yesterday, Murat Yuce was shot in the head by one of three masked men after a statement was read in Turkish. </p> <p>It said: \"I have a word of advice for any Turk who wants to come to Iraq to work. You don't have to hold a gun to be aiding the occupying United States ... Turkish companies should withdraw from Iraq.\" </p> <p>In Ankara, the Bilintur company, which provides a laundry service for a Jordanian company in Iraq, said Mr Yuce was one of two employees missing in Iraq for three or four days. Another Turkish driver, Birdal Sancar, was killed last week near the border with Syria, the Anatolia news agency reported yesterday.</p>",
  "The American government has shelved for 12 months its security plan to require all British travellers to have a biometric passport or a visa. <p>The deadline of October 26 this year set by Washington provoked protests from the travel trade on both sides of the Atlantic. More than 4 million British tourists visit America every year. </p> <p>British tourists or business visitors with a machine-readable passport - with a magnetic strip of data - can enter the US without a visa. </p> <p>The original demand for more secure biometric passports, with a digitally encoded photograph or electronic fingerprint, followed the September 11 attacks. </p> <p>But the UK passport service says that the US Senate has endorsed a one-year deferral which means Britons with machine-readable passports will be able to travel to the US under the visa waiver programme up to and beyond October 2005.</p>",
  "<p>HSBC demonstrated its status as a global banking giant yesterday by generating profits at a faster pace than any other European company. </p> <p>In reporting pre-tax profits of \u00a35.1bn in the first six months of the year, the bank surpassed a previous record set by the oil company BP and set a high hurdle for other big banks. </p> <p>The figures show that although it is based in a new tower in the Canary Wharf complex in London, HSBC does not rely on Britain for its profits. Only 22% of the total is generated in the UK, where it makes money from personal customers, businesses and major corporations. </p> <p>By the bank's own calculations its 8.5m customers in Britain make it \u00a380 profit a year each, or \u00a31.54 a week. The profit angered unions in Britain, where 7,500 jobs are being cut over the next three years, but the bank does not think it is good enough. </p> <p>\"You might criticise me for it. You might say I should be making a lot more,\" Michael Geoghegan, the chief executive of HSBC's UK bank said. </p> <p>The red and white hexagon logo of the self-styled \"world's local bank\" - which first replaced Midland bank's familiar Griffin in 1997 - is found in 79 countries around the world, in which the bank employs 232,000 people and claims 210m customers. About 55,000 work in Britain, 40,000 in the branch business. </p> <p>Hong Kong, where the bank was founded in the 1860s and from which it took its name of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, generated 25% of profits. </p> <p>The largest part - almost 34% of the total - is generated in North America, where HSBC has expanded rapidly through acquisition in the last five years. It bought the banking operations of Edmond Safra shortly before he died in a mysterious fire at home in Monaco, and more recently the consumer finance business Household International. </p> <p>The expansion into the US has been a key part of the transformation of HSBC, and one of the explanations for the record-breaking profits. It now fights with Citigroup of the US and Bank of America as one of the world's top three banks. </p> <p>But the bank was also coming full circle yesterday as it confirmed that it was nearing an agreement with the Chinese authorities to take a near 20% in the Bank of Communications. China was the reason for its creation. It was the market that Thomas Sutherland, the then Hong Kong superintendent of the Peninsula &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company, wanted to tap in the 1860s when he set up HSBC with \"Scottish banking principles\". </p> <p>The bank's top executives still take pride in these Scottish roots, particularly the association with frugality. HSBC's chairman, Sir John Bond, often uses the Jubilee Line to travel to the Canary Wharf headquarters. </p> <p>But in expanding the bank has also had to accept a divergence from its traditional reputation. William Aldinger, the head of the Household business in the US, was hired on a $37m pay packet. Yesterday HSBC revealed that he took home \u00a32.5m in the last six months in free shares as part of this deal. </p> <p>John Studzinski, recently hired to redevelop HSBC's investment banking business, employs a driver and bag carrier. He has hired 700 people to replace the 700 people he let go as part of his efforts to rejuvenate the operation. </p> <p>While the revolving door in the HSBC investment bank has attracted attention in the City, the job cuts in the retail bank are attracting most publicity. By the end of today the 3,500 people who are losing their jobs this year will know who they are. Some of the jobs are being replaced in low cost centres in places such as India, while others are going just to reduce costs. </p> <p>The finance union Unifi has been fighting the job cuts, which are taking place at the same time as the bank is putting an emphasis on boosting business through its 1,587 branches </p> <p>Rob O'Neill of Unifi said: \"We don't know how HSBC directors can sleep at night. Instead of rewarding staff for their part in making HSBC as profitable as it is, the bank is slashing 7,500 jobs in the UK and exporting more and more work to Asia in an attempt to cut costs.\" </p> <p>The bank argues that it needs to boost its business in Britain which, while generating 22% of the overall profit, accounts for 32% of costs. It has a 15% share of the country's 30m current account customers but just a 4% share of mortgages. Its UK profits are less than the equivalent profits of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, which last week reported \u00a31.5bn and \u00a32.1bn profits respectively. </p> <p>The desire to boost its position in mortgages - it achieved record new business in the first half - is one of reasons it has been touted as a potential buyer of Abbey National, which has agreed to sell itself to Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain. </p> <p>HSBC tried to brush off talk of entering a bid battle for Abbey yesterday. But it is one of the few banks to have pulled off a rare cross-border European deal, buying CCF in France three years ago. </p> <p>Stephen Green, the chief executive of the entire HSBC group, insisted that he did not see the bank as British and said the its customers around the world did not either. A recent survey asked customers in Mexico where HSBC came from. The commonest answer was \"don't know\". </p> <p>This lack of identification with Britain, along with the fact that HSBC executives are known to be frustrated by the UK regulatory environment, helps speculation that HSBC will soon move its headquarters from London, where it was forced to locate in 1992 as a condition of buying Midland. Back in the 1860s Thomas Sutherland went to great lengths to avoid a London head office by getting the Treasury to agree to a special order in Hong Kong. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Green would only say: \"London is a great place to be based. We are a international bank that happens to be based here.\"</p>",
  "The Russian parliament is poised to introduce new legislation that will ban beer advertising on television between 7am and 10pm because of growing concerns about the number of children who have become addicted to alcohol. <p>The new law also prohibits the use in adverts of people, animals or cartoon figures, and messages that suggest beer will help you achieve your goals, improve your health or mental capacity or satisfy your thirst. </p> <p>Beer advertising will also be banned on the front and back covers of newspapers and magazines. </p> <p>The Duma, the country's lower house, is expected to pass the law on Thursday. </p> <p>It is a significant step in a country where beer is treated as only slightly stronger than a soft drink. In Moscow, a clinic to treat child alcoholics was opened last autumn, and senior health officials say the number of children under 14 with an addiction - most often to alcohol - has risen from about 6,300 a decade ago to more than 22,000 today. </p> <p>\"Attractive, obsessive and aggressive beer advertising makes it extremely attractive for consumption,\" security committee head, Vladimir Vasilyev, told the Duma. </p> <p>The move comes as beer grows steadily more popular with Russian drinkers. The average Russian's beer consumption has increased from 37 litres a year in 1999 to 51 litres in 2003, one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. </p> <p>In Russia, even beer containing 9-10% alcohol is considered a light-alcohol drink, and is therefore sold more freely than vodka or whisky. </p> <p>Beer is available almost everywhere, at any time, and is a common accessory for both morning commuters and the after-school crowd. Half-litre bottles, at 20-30 rubles apiece (37-56p), are lined up at fast-food stalls and in street kiosks alongside bottled water and cartons of fruit juice. </p> <p>The casual attitude carries over into television advertising. In one advert, Albert Einstein puzzles over his formula - then drinks a bottle of beer for inspiration. In another, polar bears celebrate after ice fishing with ice-cold beer. </p> <p>Brewers have fought against the advertising ban, arguing that while they are against children drinking, television adverts are not the real problem. </p> <p>Vyacheslav Mamontov, head of the Russian Brewers' Union said: \"We are in favour of banning the sale of beer to children under 18.\" </p> <p>He said the Duma is trying to draw attention away from an unpopular bill replacing social benefits with cash payments, also slated for passage this week. \"Children drinking beer, this is not the problem of brewers. This is a social problem,\" he said. </p> <p>Though the ban on advertising is expected to come into effect shortly, beer will remain widely available. The original legislation, introduced in 2001, would also have classified beer as a strong alcoholic drink to make it more difficult to sell, and restricted beer to an alcohol content of 6%. But that portion of the bill was discarded. </p> <p>Some 2.2 million Russians are registered as having alcohol problems, and, on average, Russians are estimated to drink about 15 litres of pure alcohol a head each year, one of the highest rates in the world. </p> <p>Alcohol is thought to be one of the reasons why life expectancy has fallen to less than 60 since the fall of the Soviet Union, with some estimates saying one in seven Russians are alcoholics.</p>"
