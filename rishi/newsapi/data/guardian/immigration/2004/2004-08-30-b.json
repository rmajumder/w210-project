  "The Berlin studio that Ellen Auerbach, who has died aged 98, formed with Grete Stern in 1932 achieved astonishing success. It combined the hallmarks of her Bauhaus training - a preoccupation with lighting and geometry - with an eye for graphic design, applied to the fields of fashion, portraiture and advertising. Auerbach is perhaps the last of the avant-garde Berlin artists who achieved their most salient work in the interwar years of the last century. Even the studio's name, ringl + pit, implied design for a new era combining names from their childhood, while concealing the artists' gender, a necessity in a male-dominated world. <p>She was born Ellen Rosenberg into a close-knit bourgeois family and went straight from school to the Karlsruhe, and then to the Stuttgart art schools, where she studied sculpture. It was when she was sculpting a head of her favourite uncle that he gave her a 9 x 12 portrait camera, to assist in \"getting the angles right\". </p> <p>The camera took over, and in 1928 she moved to Berlin. It was the height of the Weimar era, already under threat from fascism, and Walter Peterhans was engaged in bringing the Neue Sachlichkeit (new objectivity) of the Bauhaus to bear on the field of photography. </p> <p>Grete Stern had already persuaded him to take her on as a pupil and, although he was in the process of moving to Dessau, he was eventually persuaded to admit Ellen too. The two young women struck up a friendship, based as much on a shared sense of humour and hard work as on their admiration for the experimentalism of photographers such as Albert Renger-Patzsch and El Lissitsky, and for Rodchenko's photo-montages and poster graphics, promoting the Soviet Union. </p> <p>According to an interview Susanne Baumann conducted with Auerbach in 1998, Peterhans had a seminal effect on their technique. \"[He taught us] how to judge the quality of a picture just by examining the negative. The very first thing I did was to take a portrait of Grete. Peterhans looked at the negative, gave an approving grunt, and then said to me: 'Whatever you end up doing in your life, you should never give up photography'. This was almost a hypnotic command!\" </p> <p>When Peterhans moved to Dessau, Stern and Ellen took on his studio, and became ringl + pit. At first taking only their friends - including each other - as models, they began attracting advertising customers, using their quirky and often subliminal associations of the products with surreal flights of fancy. The hair gloss, Petrole Hahn, was held by a mannequin sporting a shiny blond wig - with a human hand protruding from her sleeve to hold the bottle up to view. </p> <p>The photo studio ringl + pit established itself as among the most innovative in Berlin. Its portraits were renowned for their originality, and manufacturers of everything from cigarettes to petroleum products went there. Stern and Ellen designed book jackets, and enjoyed creating publicity spreads that appeared in the most prominent magazines of the day. </p> <p>Later, Auerbach would modestly conclude: \"Some people who write about ringl + pit say that we were forerunners, not only because of our independence, but because of our style. However, when one runs, one doesn't know what one is running in front of. They were extraordinary times in which we began our work, and we were simply carried along with them.\" Sadly, within a year, time was already running out. </p> <p>In 1933, they recognised what Hitler's rise inevitably meant to two young Jewish women. As Auerbach later put it: \"It did not seem wise to remain in a country that was putting people like us into concentration camps\". The \"people like us\" were to include her parents, something for which she never forgave herself. Stern left for London, where she sought to re-establish ringl + pit, and invited Ellen to join her. </p> <p>Ellen fled first to Palestine where she became the official photographer for the Women's International Zionist Organisation (Wizo). She then established a studio called ishon, meaning \"apple of your eye\" - a now-nostalgic reference to the eye of the camera she had adopted as her own, and to children, whom she specialised in photographing. She also met fellow photographer and future husband, Walter Auerbach. </p> <p>In 1935, Ellen joined Grete Stern to resume their partnership in London. However, the British government decided otherwise, and a year later, having been refused both residence and work permits, the two women were forced to move again. By now Stern was with her future husband, the Argentinian photographer Horacio Coppola, and they emigrated to Buenos Aires. </p> <p>Ellen and Walter Auerbach moved on to the United States. Apart from some socially conscious pictures of the East End, and informal portraits of her friend Bertolt Brecht, little remains of her London stay. </p> <p>The Auerbachs settled near Philadelphia where they had relatives. In 1944 the couple moved to New York, where Ellen began to pick up commissions for Time, Life and Photo Technique and she made record covers for Columbia Masterworks - in short, gathering work where she could, as a freelance. She also worked on 16mm films, primarily of children at play. At the end of the war, her marriage failing, she travelled to meet Stern in Argentina, then around much of Europe, a predictably harrowing experience. </p> <p>Auerbach was by now out of kilter with the style of the times. She concentrated on her work with children, and research into those with learning difficulties. From 1946-49 she worked with Dr Sybille Escalona at the Menninger Foundation in Kansas, and in the early 1950s taught photography at the Junior College for Arts and Crafts in Trenton, New Jersey. Later, from the age of 60, she was to devote 20 years to working with disturbed children. </p> <p>In the 1955-56 winter she accompanied photographer Eliot Porter on a journey to Mexico. It was her last professional fling with photography, and it took 30 years for the fruits of this expedition to be realised in Mexican Churches (1987), and Mexican Celebrations (1989). </p> <p>In 1993, a first historical book entitled ringl + pit was published, tellingly in Berlin. An exhibition of the same name toured German cities, and in London the Zelda Cheatle gallery showed a selection of the work. Yet, despite Auerbach's inclusion in such exhibitions as Photography: a Facet of Modernism (1986) in San Francisco or in Naomi Rosenblum's Women Photographers (1996), Ellen has lacked proper recognition in the US. It was only after the Robert Mann Gallery's Ellen Auerbach: from Bauhaus to God's House (1994), that she began to achieve a firm international reputation. </p> <p>I first met Auerbach a decade ago, in the New York apartment of Ingeborg von Zitzewitz. Her walls were hung with Ellen's prints of California and New Mexico. Von Zitzewitz explained that she had mounted an exhibition of Ellen's work for the Goethe Institute in the 1960s, but that the photographer had been pursuing her career in working with children. Ellen was invited round, and we spent an afternoon that went on through half the night, in observance of her dictum: \"It is my wish to make one person laugh every day. Should I make two people laugh on any given day, I get a day off\". </p> <p>Thereafter, each time we met in her modest apartment overlooking the upper east side, she earned her days off. She also shared her personal albums, detailing both her family on their Sunday walks, and her visit to see Stern in Argentina. Regardless of whether the work was \"public\" or \"private\", there was nothing of the snapshot about any of it: a 4 x 5 workprint of a Buenos Aires bar on a corner, a donkey tethered outside and empty streets spread around in the heat of the sun was as perfectly focused and framed as any in her books. </p> <p>Ellen, while to be remembered for her portraits, was at her most vital in the period of ringl + pit. As Margarett Loke wrote in Art News, when the Robert Mann retrospective was mounted: \"One of the most unusual photographers to have had several artistic lives is Ellen Auerbach\". </p> <p>Her marriage ended in 1945. She has no direct descendants. </p> <p><br><b>\u00b7</b> Ellen Auerbach (Ellen Rosenberg) photographer, born May 20 1906; died July 31 2004</p>",
  "<p>There's something delightfully untelevisual about Adam Nicolson, the charming toff who's bumbling his way up the west coast of the British Isles in a wooden ketch for <strong> Atlantic Britain</strong> (Channel 4, Saturday). He's not obvious front-of-camera material - with a touch of Ken Dodd about his look, and a plummy PG Wodehouse voice that will often, for no obvious reason, erupt into a wonderful snorting guffaw, the sort of noise you might expect to come out of a male walrus on reaching orgasm. </p> <p>Adam is useless at sailing, but happily skipper George is on hand to do all that. George makes all the decisions, even when Adam thinks he's doing so. </p> <p>\"Are we going to walk back up there without having a go?\" asks George, about whether they should give up on their attempt to rescue their dinghy, which Adam has capsized and abandoned. What George actually means is: \"Of course we're going to have a go at getting it back.\" </p> <p>\"We're going to have a go,\" announces Adam, as if the idea is his. As it turns out, it's not a very clever decision, and poor George almost drowns during the operation. </p> <p>What Adam does have, by the bucketload, is enthusiasm. A fan of both geology and natural history, he can barely contain his excitement when the incredible layered Pembrokeshire cliffs produce a trilobite fossil from 525 million years ago. And approaching the Island of Grassholm, he comes over all poetic about its huge seabird colony. \"Look at it, you can see it frothing with gannets. The whole thing is like the head on a pint of Guinness.\" </p> <p>While Adam Nicolson is chipping his way 525 million years into the past, <strong> The Future Is Wild</strong> (BBC2, Sunday) takes a speculative look in the opposite direction. First stop: five million years from now; and it's not a friendly place. A two kilometre-thick blanket of ice covers most of the planet, and man's brief existence is long since over. There aren't even any gannets, as they've evolved into gannet whales, big blubbery things with the heads of birds and the bodies of walrus. And how about that, I was right! They do sound a bit like Adam Nicolson laughing, and they're not even mating. </p> <p>This is not pure fantasy; these are \"experiments in the imagination of some of the world's top scientists\", if it's possible to experiment with the imagination. These scientists studied past trends in evolution, and using predictions about climate change, ice ages, continental drift, etc, they came up with some ideas of what beasts could be around. Then it was over to the computer graphics people. Some of the imagery is a bit comedic in its jerkiness and lack of a third dimension, but it's all such good fun it hardly seems to matter. </p> <p>My favourite creature is the Kryptile, a lizardy thing with a hood made of sticky flypaper. It runs around the salt flats that used to be the Mediterranean sea, accelerating into swarms of insects to collect its lunch. </p> <p>By the time we reach 200 million years into the future, the earth is hardly recognisable. All land has fused into one great continent, flish swoop down from the sky to pluck silver swimmers from the sea. In the vast deserts, terrorbites attack garden worms with elaborate chemical weapons. And in the forests, squibble swing between the branches of huge lichen trees. </p> <p>It's all quite familiar, though I can't quite put my finger on it... until I remember: </p> <p> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves </p> <p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; </p> <p>All mimsy were the borogoves </p> <p>And the mome raths outgrabe. </p> <p>The whole thing is totally Carrollian. </p> <p>Back to the past for <strong> The Worst Jobs in History</strong> (Channel 4, Saturday), but only as far as the dark ages. Tony Robinson is not just finding out about really rubbish vocations, he's trying them out as well. So he has a go at being a Welsh gold miner and takes a turn at the oar of a Viking long boat, and abseils down a sea cliff in search of gannets' eggs. OK, so it was guillemots' eggs, really, I was just trying to hang on to a tenuous theme. Worse still was to be a wattler and dauber. Wattling isn't so bad, but daubing involves mixing straw and mud with animal dung using nothing but your bare hands. None of which should really have bothered Tony Robinson. He was Baldrick in Blackadder, of course, and, if I remember correctly, he was quite experienced in dung shovelling, as well as in milking pigs and mucking-out lepers.</p>",

  "The Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bomb that ripped through Kabul yesterday. The Afghan government said two Americans, three Nepalese and two Afghans were killed in what was the largest attack for months in the Afghan capital. <p>A further 10 people, nine of them children, were killed in a separate bombing in southern Afghanistan at the weekend, marking a serious escalation in violence in the run up to October's presidential election. </p> <p>The Kabul bomb exploded in the late afternoon in front an office occupied by Dyncorp, a private firm that protects interim Afghan president Hamid Karzai, and which also works for the US government in Iraq. </p> <p>The explosion, which a Taliban official said had been triggered by a remote-controlled device, shook rush-hour Kabul at about 5.40pm, shattering windows half a mile away. Smoke billowed from the building as emergency services rushed to the scene. Plain-clothes US soldiers car rying submachine guns cordoned off the area with the help of Afghan police. </p> <p>At the blast site several vehicles stood destroyed in front of a gutted building. One badly charred vehicle was overturned close to a metre-deep crater in the centre of the road, which appeared to mark the detonation point. A witness, Abdul Jalil, wearing a bloodstained tunic and with a bandage on his face, stumbled from the scene with the help of Afghan police officers. </p> <p>He had been working in the building next door when the bomb went off, he said. </p> <p>\"I was sitting on a chair waiting for office hours to finish. There was an explosion, and a big fire in front of the American and British house. Then I saw some seriously injured foreigners running from their office.\" </p> <p>The interior minister, Ali Ahmad Jalali, visited the scene of the explosion an hour later. At that time he said he knew that least four people had been killed and two injured. </p> <p>\"Terrorists are behind this action,\" he said, but refused to speculate on which group was responsible, saying only: \"Terrorists are terrorists. That's their identity.\" </p> <p>Mr Jalali said the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) and the Afghan police had started investigations into the explosion. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters that the device had been detonated by remote control. </p> <p>Reporters saw the badly mutilated body of a man lying in the street before Afghan police and foreign security guards pushed them back at gunpoint. Residents said a boy living in a neighbouring house and a cobbler whose stall was blown away by the blast were also killed, and up to eight others wounded. </p> <p>The second attack happened in Naiknam, a village in Paktia province, 80 miles south of Kabul, on Saturday night when a blast ripped through a religious school. The provincial governor, Haji Assadullah Wafa, said the explosion was caused by a mine laid by the Taliban, who are fighting US troops in the area. </p> <p>\"They don't want Afghan children to study and participate in the future reconstruction of their country,\" Mr Wafa told the Guardian. The school had received funding from the International Rescue Committee, an American aid agency, he added. </p> <p>The Taliban have vowed to disrupt Afghanistan's forthcoming presidential election on October 9, which the interim president Mr Karzai is favoured to win. </p> <p>Mr Wafa said the Taliban were still using Pakistan as a rear base, despite promises from the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, that he would stop them. \"Taliban fugitives receive logistical support in Pakistan and then cross the border to plot against the security and stability of Afghanistan,\" he said. </p> <p>As night fell in Kabul the police carried a body wrapped in black plastic on a stretcher from the scene of the blast. US special forces used sniffer dogs and torches to search the surrounding area for possible secondary explosives. </p> <p>\"This was a big one,\" said one gun-wielding plain-clothes soldier standing near by.</p>",
  "<p>We already have a largely untapped nursing workforce in this country, in the form of refugee nurses (Nil by mouth, August 27). This is a workforce desperate to make a professional contribution to healthcare in the country that has given them sanctuary. They have had to move on from often very distressing, life-threatening situations - they are not benefit cheats, they are benefit bringers. </p> <p>In July, the Refugee Nurses' Task Force launched its strategy and acknowledged the good practice of a small number of \"centres of excellence\" (mainly in London) where refugee nurses are being successfully assimilated into the workforce. The health minister, John Hutton, agreed that these examples need to be replicated more widely. </p> <p>Why can't we work smart here instead of raiding our less well to do global neighbours?<br><strong>Roswyn Hakesley-Brown</strong><br>Chairwoman, Refugee Nurses' Task Force </p> <p>John Carvel points out an important problem that cannot be changed very easily without rethinking the basis of international aid. While supporting the nursing needs of hospitals in the UK or in the US, these countries are in fact acting contrary to their international aid commitments. The drain of qualified medical personnel is a major issue in dealing with Aids in Africa, particularly as the new approach in rolling out treatment requires and depends on availability of qualified staff.</p> <p>It is central that the inter national Aids commitments are based on people's right to health, which cannot be trumped by the market orientation initiated in the medical sector in some of the industrialised countries. This requires policies that are based on overall human rights rather than an ethical division between national and international interests.<br><strong>Dr Hakan Seckinelgin</strong><br>Lecturer in international social policy, LSE</p> <p>John Carvel rightly points out the cost to poorer countries of poaching their health personnel. This \"brain drain\" has been operating for centuries, but it is only in recent decades that it has grown to be a major problem. It is time that the matter be seriously addressed. </p> <p>It could be solved by a system of tariffs paid to the poorer country by the richer ones. Professionals in most countries are required to register with a national authority, a nursing council, medical council etc. These bodies can supply the necessary information to enable tariffs to be calculated. They would be based on training costs and the differential in GDPs. </p> <p>This would provide a satisfactory system of compensation by richer to poorer countries without penalising those who wished to travel to pursue their careers. It need not be unduly cumbersome. It could be set up through the World Trade Organisation. The ministry of health can initiate it, if only to salve its conscience.<br><strong>Dr John Gleisner</strong><br>London</p>",
  "Two South Africans acquitted by a Zimbabwean court of charges related to the alleged coup plot in Equatorial Guinea are to be questioned today by the South African authorities. <p>Harry Carlse and Lourens Horn were cleared of trying to buy weapons in Zimbabwe when their British leader, Simon Mann, was convicted. They were freed on Saturday and flew back to South Africa. They will be questioned by the Scorpions investigation unit in Pretoria, which arrested Sir Mark Thatcher last week. </p> <p>Their lawyer said they expected to be charged under the South African law against mercenary activities. \"They will go to the Scorpions offices in Pretoria for questioning about possible contravention of the Foreign Military Assistance Act,\" Alwyn Griebenow said. </p> <p>They are among the 66 suspects cleared by a Zimbabwean magistrate on Friday of weapons offences. The 64 others face penalties for immigration offences and remain in jail. Simon Mann, who admitted trying to buy weapons, could face a 10-year jail sentence. </p> <p>Mr Carlse and Mr Horn alleged that they had been tortured in jail. Mr Horn also claimed that he was stripped naked and beaten during interrogations and threatened with electric shocks if he did not answer questions. </p> <p>Sir Mark remains under house arrest in Cape Town on charges of financing the coup plot. He has not yet posted his bail of 2m rand (\u00a3166,000). </p> <p>Two of Mann's associates, Crause Steyl, a pilot, and James Kershaw, a computer expert, are believed to be giving the South African authorities evidence linking Sir Mark to Mann and the alleged coup. </p> <p>Ron Wheeldon, spokesman for Sir Mark's legal team in Cape Town, told the Guardian yesterday that they had been told to stay away from Mr Steyl and Mr Kershaw. </p> <p>Mr Steyl is believed to have given details of Sir Mark's investment in an aviation company which had contracts with Mann. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea has asked to interview Sir Mark in South Africa, and the deputy president said his government was seeking an international warrant for his arrest and hoped to have him extradited for trial.</p>",
  "<p>The Old Shieling Hotel, in Raheny on Dublin's north side, is one of the shrines of Irish music. The Dubliners, Christy Moore and the Wolftones all used to play in the large back-room bar. Tonight it's packed out again, with a young crowd screaming for the most controversial new singer-songwriter in Ireland, who lives within walking distance. </p> <p>Damien Dempsey arrives on stage carrying his guitar to a deafening chant of \"Dam-O, Dam-O\", as if he was some boy-band hero rather than a thoughtful and angry balladeer. </p> <p>He's a burly, quietly spoken figure with cropped hair, once known for his boxing skills as much as his music, and he starts with a low-key introduction. \"This is a song about my home town,\" he announces, in a broad Dublin accent, and he throws back his shoulders as he launches into a solo treatment of Factories, Trains and Houses. It's a personal, bittersweet song about growing up in the district, with its fights, deaths, joy-riding and drugs; as with much of his work, the stark realism is offset by a gutsy optimism and a sturdy melody. </p> <p>He brings on a flute-player and drummer as he shifts from traditional roots to reggae and then the Irish rap of Celtic Tiger, about greed and the damage caused by the booming Dublin economy. And there's Ghosts of Overdoses, which deals with drugs and the loss of community. These are brave, serious songs, and his followers know every word. Two of his heroes, the Dubliners, are among the crowd. </p> <p>Dempsey, 27, has been fighting to establish himself as a singer for over a decade. He has a batch of famous admirers, from Shane MacGowan and Morrissey to Christy Moore, but not everyone in Dublin approves. \"People love me or hate me,\" he says. \"There's no in-between. There's a big thing about accents here in Dublin. People say, 'You can't sing like that.' I've come across opposition even in working-class areas.\" He fits uneasily into the current Irish music scene. There's a strong traditional movement, \"but they are playing tunes, not new songs and ballads. There are no new bands coming up doing something Irish.\" </p> <p>He has carefully planned our interview. We meet in a bar in Raheny, talk for an hour and then walk to another bar through the estates of Donaghmede, where he still lives with his father, a panel-beater. He points out the spots favoured by joy-riders and junkies, as he describes how he came to sing about his neighbourhood. \"There were always parties at home where everyone would sing, and I begged to stay up to listen. Then I heard Thin Lizzy's Whiskey in the Jar when I was 12, and I just wanted to get a guitar and grow my hair. Then I heard Bob Marley and later rappers like Ice Cube. I was like a sponge.\" </p> <p>He learned to box for his own protection. \"I had seen the film Rocky, and loads of kids wanted to be boxers after that. And I was a bit of a target for the skinheads, going round the area with my long hair and a guitar. There were a few scrapes . . .\" He thumps his hands. \"But once you clobbered one or two of the guys who had a reputation, the word spread and you were left alone.\" A more recent fight, when he was set upon outside a chip shop six years ago, almost ended his career. \"There was a trend of gangs jumping on one fellow and beating him up, and I got caught. I nearly bit my tongue off, and couldn't talk for a month or sing for six months. It made me realise how essential it is for me to sing.\" </p> <p>He is a complex but open man. \"Underneath the rough exterior there's a soft, sensitive sort of soul,\" he announces. \"It gets battered with all the things I see, but the singing helps me vent all that. I look round and see things, and they seem to affect me much more than they affect my friends. I've just written a song about that - Cursed for the Brain.\" </p> <p>Unlike many of his friends, Dempsey stayed on at school until he was 17, \"just to oblige my mother, though I loved history and literature\". But he refused to go to a traditional college and enlisted at the Ballyfermot Rock School, where he was taught about music management and record deals. Then began the long slog to establish his career. </p> <p>The school put out a CD that included his song Cardboard City (\"about the Dublin homeless\") and he was asked to mime at a promotional concert. \"I felt like an idiot, but the boxing experience came in handy. I was ducking the bottles as they came flying in.\" After that he played anywhere he could - \"bars and clubs and support gigs, and usually I didn't get paid. Often I had to pay to play.\" A single, Dublin Town, was a radio hit for a few weeks \"but was recorded as a novelty song and the meaning was lost\". His first album, They Don't Teach This Shit in School, failed to sell. \"There was no money for promotion,\" Dempsey recalls. \"I didn't have a chance.\" </p> <p>For a while he gave up performing and moved to New York, where he worked in an Irish bar. It was a depressing period. \"I thought I was going nowhere. If I had left school at 15 and got a trade I might have had my own home by now, and a car, but here I was sleeping on friends' couches. And the welcome soon gets worn out . . .\" </p> <p>Everything began to change when he returned to Dublin. The producer and drummer John Reynolds, who has worked with the likes of Jah Wobble and Sinead O'Connor, invited him to London to record an album in his home studio. Reynolds said he would \"work on it and add in a few bits\", and Dempsey was astonished by the result. \"He sent me the CD, and I heard this voice coming in - he'd added Sinead doing backing vocals without even telling me. And there was a new guitar riff. It was Brian Eno.\"O'Connor was so impressed she recorded her own version of Dempsey's It's All Good. </p> <p>He'd been discovered. This summer he played at the London Fleadh and Womad, and opened for Bob Dylan in Ireland. Morrissey asked him to appear at the Meltdown festival. He peers into his Guinness and contemplates the change. \"It's a great lift after all these years of being slagged off, but I'm still living with my father, and financially it's been a struggle to keep going. But I'm in this for the long haul.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Damien Dempsey plays the Borderline, London W1 (020-7534 6970), on Wednesday and Friday.

  "<p>When the Leeds festival sold out in record time this year, its promoters, Mean Fiddler, suggested the growing apathy towards superstar DJ-led dance festivals lay at the heart of the resurgence in ticket sales. Its older sister festival in Reading rose to prominence as an exclusively rock festival in the 1970s, but this year, a more eclectic booking policy across the two events has no doubt helped to widen their appeal. </p> <p>DJ-led dance music might be in decline, but the influence of the late-80s Madchester dance scene is noticeable in the music of newcomers such as Kasabian and !!! (pronounced chk-chk-chk, apparently), who drew large crowds. </p> <p>The Streets languished in an early afternoon slot that had been confirmed before their recent number 1, Dry Your Eyes, a song that proved Mike Skinner had the emotional depth to match the overcast skies. Skinner only had time for a 30-minute set after being stuck in traffic - with the ferris wheel slowly revolving in the distance and the ice cream vans doing healthy business, it all made for a quintessentially English bank holiday experience. </p> <p>Brooklyn rapper 50 Cent was blighted by the competition, having neither the vocal dynamics of Jurassic 5 nor DJ Format's turntable skills - both of which received rapturous responses elsewhere. His incessant demands to \"raise your hands\" became wearisome when he managed little to justify such a display of affection, and he was brought down to size during In da Club by a sign in the crowd that read \"Hey Fifty, it's spelled In THE Club\". Lynne Truss would be proud. </p> <p>The Darkness's delusions of grandeur have snow-balled them through the past year from toilet circuit regulars to main stage headliners. Saturday's set culminated in a choreographed fireworks display worthy of the greatest excesses of their heroes, Queen. A paucity of quality material left them stretched to fill a 90-minute set but for sheer audacity, the four men from Lowestoft showed there is still room for 1970s-styled monsters of rock on the Leeds and Reading roster.</p>",
  "The Australian prime minister, John Howard, yesterday called a general election for October 9, beginning his campaign with the issue that sank Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar in Spain and threatens the re-election of George Bush and Tony Blair. <p>\"This election ... will be about trust,\" he told a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra. </p> <p>\"Who do you trust to keep the economy strong and protect family living standards? ... Who do you trust to lead the fight on Australia's behalf against international terrorism?\" </p> <p>His target was the Labor opposition leader, Mark Latham. </p> <p>But it is his own integrity that has been put in question in the past three weeks, in particular by the allegation that he has lied about the Iraq war and the refugee policy which won him and his Liberal-National coalition a third term in 2001. </p> <p>\"We have had too much dishonesty from the Howard government,\" Mr Latham said. </p> <p>\"I can agree with the prime minister in saying that the election is about trust. If people don't trust this government any more, it's with good reason. It is a government that's been dishonest for too long.\" </p> <p>Three years ago Australians watched SAS soldiers storm the Norwegian freighter Tampa to stop it bringing refugees rescued at sea to land on Australian soil. </p> <p>Mr Howard's hard line on refugees was the backdrop to the 2001 election, but the fallout threatens to throw this campaign off balance. </p> <p>In the past fortnight he has been repeatedly attacked about a claim by former civil servants that he lied before the 2001 election about refugees throwing their children into the sea. </p> <p>Asked about it yesterday, he said: \"It's been done to death, that issue, and I have no further comment on it.\" </p> <p>Earlier this month 43 former military and foreign affairs officials attacked his international reputation by calling his post-September 11 foreign policy deceptive and dangerous. </p> <p>These issues do not mean much to Australians. Mr Howard's trustworthiness rating stands at 57%, and has actually risen slightly since 2001, despite the fallout from the Iraq war and an inquiry into the children overboard affair. </p> <p>Mr Latham mentioned Iraq only once at a press conference devoted to domestic issues, and even that was in response to a question. </p> <p>None the less, the announcement of the six-week campaign - rather than the usual five weeks - is seen as a tactic to head off further damaging criticism of Mr Howard's record on Iraq and refugees, because it will ensure that the lower house of representatives does not sit next week. </p> <p>The Labor-controlled senate will sit till on Tuesday, however, and its leader, John Faulkner, revealed yesterday that a potentially damaging inquiry into the latest children overboard claim will report by October 7, two days before polling. </p> <p>Mr Howard's government is trailing Labor in the opinion polls, as it did before the November 2001 general election, when the preferred redistribution of votes from minor parties to the two leading parties - the characteristic of the Australian system - is taken into account. On simple preferences the parties are currently neck-and neck. </p> <p>Mr Howard is 65 to Mr Latham's 43, but he said yesterday: \"They are going to ask themselves which of these two blokes is more likely to keep my mortgage affordable ... that's far more important than the age difference.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kelly Holmes made Olympic history and the front pages of the Sunday papers when she ran to victory in Athens in the 1,500 metres, adding to her gold medal in the 800 metres last Monday. </p> <p>\"It took Kelly Holmes less than four minutes to immortalise herself,\" cheered David Randall in the <strong>Independent on Sunday</strong>. \"In a time of three minutes 57.9 seconds, she performed a feat that only one British man has ever achieved. Holmes, in the best possible sense, is now history.\" </p> <p>The <strong>Sunday Mirror</strong> concurred. \"Ice-cool Kelly\" had indeed earned her place in history \"with one of the greatest performances of any modern British track athlete\". </p> <p>In the <strong>Observer</strong>, Steve Ovett applauded \"Britain's new heroine\". For Ovett, who won a gold and a bronze in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, Holmes's double-gold win was \"a classic case of what the Olympics are really about: unpredictability, not world records\". </p> <p>Holmes \"will be honoured as Britain's golden girl for the rest of her life\", reckoned the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>. \"Her lustre is all the greater because, at 34, she counts almost as a geriatric and carries enough injuries to condemn a horse to the knacker's yard. That she could still destroy the world's fastest runners with searing bursts of speed from the final bend seemed miraculous.\" </p> <p>Holmes showed that \"if you can put past failures behind you then, just maybe, you can come from behind to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat,\" said Christa Ackroyd in the <strong>Sunday Express.</strong> </p> <p>Holmes also caught the imagination of Roy Hattersley. Despite \"years of defeat and disappointment, she never gave up,\" he said in the <strong>Mail on Sunday</strong>. On Saturday \"she became an immortal with double Olympic gold\". But he was exasperated by Paula Radcliffe's failure to complete the 10,000 metres on Friday. \"We need, out of kindness if nothing else, to forget about Radcliffe for a while. The names that should be on our lips are those of Kelly Holmes, Matthew Pinsent and all the other medal-winners, together with the hundreds of British athletes who worked their way to Athens, felt proud to take part and did their level best .... They were the men and women who finished the course. Theirs was the true glory,\" concluded Hattersley.</p>",
  "African Union ceasefire monitors were yesterday investigating claims that the Sudanese military had bombarded a village with helicopter gunships, only days before the UN deadline to end the violence in Darfur expires. <p>Um Hashab lies in ruins and abandoned after Thursday's attack on the Sudan Liberation Army, one of two rebel factions waging war against the government in Khartoum. </p> <p>The charred earth, scorched trees and empty mud and straw huts in the desert settlement provide evidence that the 18-month war continues, despite an April 8 ceasefire. </p> <p>A 24-hour rebel boycott of peace talks in Nigeria ended late on Sunday, with insurgents returning to negotiations after a protest walkout over allegations that government forces and allied Arab militia, the Janjaweed, continued to target civilians in the western region. </p> <p>\"Everybody fled,\" said a villager, Adam Salim Abu Bakir, who is now in a nearby refugee camp. \"Everything that we wear, that we eat and drink - burnt. But nobody died. Now were are living under the scorching sun. We have nothing.\" </p> <p>A Sudanese government delegate in Nigeria, Najib Abdulwahab, questioned the allegations. </p> <p>The UN has given Sudan until Monday to disarm militias and end the violence.</p>",
  "<p>It may seem premature to be talking about the next summer Olympic games in Beijing when the Olympic flame has only just been extinguished in Athens, but the organisation for the 2008 event is moving at lightning speed. </p> <p>The Beijing Organising Committee (BOC) has spent the past few months securing major commercial and sponsorship agreements which are expected to make the 2008 games the most financially successful in Olympic history. </p> <p>It has been little reported but already Volkswagen, the biggest passenger car manufacturer in China, has beaten competition from rivals such as Daimler-Chrysler, Hyundai Motor and BMW to win exclusive rights as the official automobile partner of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, an agreement worth $100m to the BOC. The Chinese passenger car market is expected to grow to 4.6m sales a year by 2008, double the current sales figure. </p> <p>This is the type of economic growth, with marketing opportunities, that has the major companies fighting to become involved in the Beijing Olympics. Bank of China and China Mobile have also signed up as BOC partners, aiming to take advantage of the rapid expansion of the financial services and mobile communications markets in China. These agreements will also include a big tie-up with the Chinese athletes involved in the winter and summer games.</p> <p>Staging a summer Olympic Games is a very expensive business and organisers have to balance the demands and expectations of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) with the needs of their own city and the legacy which the Olympics will leave behind for future generations. </p> <p>What Beijing has done very well is to use its rights from a very early stage to raise significant funds at a local level. Olympic funding is underpinned by two big elements - television rights and sponsorship. In Athens, television broadcast rights fees contributed about half of the $3.5bn raised while income from sponsorship contributed another $1.1bn. </p> <p>It is this latter source of revenue which the BOC have identified as one which they can control and they have taken advantage of their economic muscle to secure some extremely lucrative sponsorship agreements which will operate alongside the IOC's own sponsors, which include Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Kodak, Visa, Samsung, Swatch and Panasonic. They all currently contribute in the region of US $50m to be one of the 11 major sponsors. Such is the appeal to these major sponsors of the huge and potentially lucrative Chinese market that at least eight of the 11 are already committed to the Beijing Games. The BOC are likely to gain about $1.5bn from sponsorship revenue alone - a 30% increase on the figure from Athens. </p> <p>The giant Chinese computer manufacturer Lenova Group recently became the first Chinese company to join the exclusive Olympic sponsorship programme and, in addition to the agreements with the Bank of China, Volkswagen and China Mobile, commercial partnerships have been agreed with Atos Origin (information technology), General Electric (technology/media), and Swatch (timing). More agreements will certainly follow in the coming months. </p> <p>The key sponsors, most of whom have been involved with the Olympics for many years, know the value the games can deliver for them at a global level. Although there is little sponsor branding at the venues or on the competitors' clothing, an involvement with the world's premier sporting event makes a big statement about a company or brand. </p> <p>Olympic sponsors are, or want to be, number one in their marketplace and the ability to use the Olympic rings on advertising and promotional material is perceived as a unique and vital asset, which delivers outstanding benefits. </p> <p>The Beijing factor has certainly \"raised the bar\" in terms of opportunities and expectations for commercial partners. China has the world's largest population at almost 1.3 billion people and it is a market that big global companies cannot afford to ignore. The many sponsors who are already signed up for the 2008 games have had to commit very significant levels of money but there is little doubt that they will be the winners by the time the Olympic flame goes out in Beijing.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Nigel Currie is director of sports and entertainment marketing agency, GEM Group</p>",
  "<p>To the producers, Midsomer Murders, <br> I am sorry to hear you have run out of ways of killing people, but perhaps this may help: I was watching the Olympics last week and I got to thinking, those javalins (sp?) are SO sharp! And the judges do stand terribly close to where they land. My wife has to close her eyes! So there is a Midsomer Games and a washed-up javalin thrower (gambling, steroids) moves the qualifying line closer in the night, so that the judge he despises is within his range. His unique footprints (special javalin shoes) give him away. Or maybe he's wet from the sprinklers. Your choice. <strong> B.E. Mellor</strong>, Lancs </p> <p><strong> Dear ITV,</strong> <br> The hardest part is getting the husband to eat the poison, because he is so suspicious. But once he's dead it's simple. You just put him through the meat grinder, and then sprinkle a little bit on the compost heap every day, so the smell doesn't build up. I think it's the perfect crime! You may have my idea for free, but if you have got any good ways of getting the husband to eat the poison, could you please email me right away.  <strong> Mrs G F Belben</strong>, Fakenham </p> <p><strong> Dear Chief Inspector Barnaby,</strong> <br> There is a way that you can punch right through a man's ribs and pull out his heart and show it to him before he dies. Everyone would naturally blame the shaolin monk who has recently moved into the area, especially because he is seeking asylum. But it would actually be a crooked antiques dealer who learned the trick in the Falklands. Something like this actually happened in my town. <br> Yours,<br><strong> Doug</strong> </p> <p><strong> To Whom It May Concern,</strong> <br> Enclosed please find my screenplay about a bank wired to explode as soon as interest rates reached 6%. I have talked to many computer experts who tell me this is perfectly feasible. You should write in BARNABY wherever it says AGENT DIRK RAMSGATE. I did the first few myself, but then it got boring. Likewise NATWEST MIDSOMER BRANCH for FIRST AMERICAN FEDERAL BANK. Otherwise I think you'll find it's a perfect fit for your series. I know three hours is a bit longer than your usual episode, so I imagine you will want to do it as a Christmas thing.<br> <strong> JT</strong> </p> <p><strong> Dear Midsomer Murderers,</strong> Killing is not entertainment. It is killing! In my series Barnaby becomes a vicar and actually helps people while they're alive, unless he's doing a funeral. There is also a funny tramp with a drink problem. Ring me if you have trouble with the handwriting. <br> <strong> Mrs Rebecca Splude</strong>, Cambridge </p> <p><strong> Dear Makers of Midsomer,</strong> <br> Laurence Llewellyn Bowen. I don't care how. <br> Anonymous.</p>"
