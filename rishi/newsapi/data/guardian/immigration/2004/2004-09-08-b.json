  "<b> Jang</b> <br> Editorial, Pakistan, September 8 <p>\"Many suggestions for improving mutual relations between Pakistan and India have come out of the second round of negotiations ... [which ended on Monday] in New Delhi ... [But] what is most surprising is that India, which had agreed to continue the talks on the Kashmir dispute, is now taking a stand that is not in consonance with the changing world scenario. In fact, on the contrary, it is creating a hurdle in the journey towards mutual understanding ... </p> <p>\"If this intransigence continues ... this would not be at all helpful in establishing durable peace ... The entire process of dialogue would be reduced to what a Persian proverb says: ' Nashistand, guftand, barkhastand ' - they sat, discussed and dispersed.\" </p> <p><b> Dawn</b><br> Editorial, Pakistan, September 8  </p> <p>\"The atmosphere [during the talks] was marked by warmth and friendship ... Considering the protracted nature of the conflict between India and Pakistan, and the fact that the two countries have gone to war thrice and have been on the brink of war a number of times, it is a major development. </p> <p>\"The two sides have reached agreement on a number of issues ... As for Kashmir, to which Pakistan has been holding on as the core issue, it was not expected to be resolved in one swoop ... This is an opportunity for peace which may not come again ... The success of these exchanges ... has led to a widespread belief that the tensions between the two countries are often created by their governments, which have a vested interest in remaining at loggerheads.\" </p> <p><b> Statesman</b><br> Editorial, India, September 8  </p> <p> \"Not a lot appears to have emerged from the latest round of talks ... with both sides sticking to their scripts - Delhi on the necessity of ending cross-border terrorism, and Islamabad on the centrality of resolving Kashmir ... </p> <p>\"The proposal to resolve Kashmir by a certain deadline, which Islamabad put forward, is clearly untenable and was rightly shot down. Right now not even the ghost of a solution that would be agreeable to both sides is visible ... However [both India and Pakistan must] get down to the nitty-gritty of how much give and take is possible on Kashmir. It is going to be a long process, but the first steps must be taken.\" </p> <p><b> Nation</b><br> Editorial, Pakistan September 8  </p> <p> \"It should be noted that Pakistan has been making one unilateral concession ... after the other since January, with precious little to show for it ... The opening of [respective] consulate generals at Karachi and Mumbai will benefit Indians more. So will the easing of visa regimes, because it is India that hopes to build up pressure in Pakistan by encouraging people-to-people contact, which it thinks will dilute the focus of all Pakistanis on the Kashmir issue ... Similarly ... forward movement on the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus and the Munabao-Khokhrapar train serve Indian purposes more than Pakistani ones. </p> <p>\"The foreign ministry must learn to distinguish between skilful diplomacy and abject surrender.\" </p> <p><b> Times of India </b><br> Editorial, September 8  </p> <p>\"Since 1947, relations between India and Pakistan have turned into a bewildering tangle of issues, with the tightest knot centred on Kashmir ... Now, it is time to cut through this Gordian knot with the sword of trade and commerce. </p> <p>\"Instead of fretting ceaselessly about the status of Kashmir, governments on both sides of the border should get to work on the peace pipes [the proposed oil and gas pipelines between the two countries].

  "Russia fired the first salvo of its response to the attack on the school in Beslan yesterday by saying that it reserved the right to make pre-emptive strikes against terrorist training camps outside the Russian Federation's borders. <p>At the same time the security services put a \u00a36m bounty on the heads of the two Chechen leaders it claims are behind the Beslan massacre, Shamil Basayev and Aslan Maskhadov. </p> <p>The two moves came as a senior Russian security officer told the Guardian that they had \"precise information\" that the Beslan attack had been \"ordered and manipulated from Islamist circles in the Middle East\", specifically against the opening day of a school. He declined to give further details. </p> <p>The official said Russia's two most wanted men - militant commander Mr Basayev and former Chechen president Mr Maskhadov - had been to Turkey within the last year. </p> <p>The chief of the Russian general staff, Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky, said: \"As for carrying out preventive strikes against terrorist bases, we will take all measures to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world.\" </p> <p>Moscow has previously threatened to attack \"terrorists\" in the region but has not before had enough international backing to do so. Militants are regularly accused of sheltering and training in the Pankisi Gorge, part of Georgian territory on the border between Chechnya and Russia, and the press regularly reports militant activity and training in neighbouring Azerbaijan. </p> <p>Moscow's decision to offer huge financial rewards for information leading to the death of Mr Basayev and Mr Maskhadov is unprecedented and mirrors US attempts to capture or kill al-Qaida members. </p> <p>The whereabouts of the two men is unknown, but Akhmed Zakayev, a spokesman for Mr Maskhadov currently living under political asylum in London, said yesterday that he feared being targeted by the Russian intelligence services. </p> <p>Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, another Chechen militant, was assassinated, allegedly by Russian agents, in Doha in February in response to an attack on the Moscow metro. Mr Zakayev told Reuters: \"I do not exclude that what they did in Qatar, they could try to do in any European country.\" </p> <p>Analysts said the move was the latest in a series of attempts to tar Mr Maskhadov with the same militant extremist brush as Mr Basayev. Mr Maskhadov, a former Soviet general, was elected president of a briefly independent Chechnya in 1997 and enjoyed a short period as an international statesman. </p> <p>Mr Basayev has shunned politics in favour of mass hostage taking and terrorism. He has been blacklisted by the UN for his alleged links to al-Qaida. The ties between the two men have led Mr Maskhadov to fall out of favour with the US, which once saw him as the key to a negotiated settlement in Chechnya. </p> <p>A senior official at the Russian security service, the FSB, said Mr Maskhadov and Mr Basayev \"cannot stand each other. But cooperation in their fight brings them closer together. You know when wolves are suffering in winter from the frost and hunger, they form a pack. In reality, it is Basayev who has influence while Maskhadov does not.\" </p> <p>He said Mr Maskhadov was being used to lend a presentable face for the west to Islamic terrorists, and his well-known personality was used to draw funds from \"Islamic circles\". </p> <p>He said the pair had \"been in Turkey several times, especially during the winter period, both last and this year\". The Turkish embassy in Moscow was not available for comment. </p> <p>Mr Basayev was last seen in Ingushetia in June, when hundreds of militants invaded the republic and killed 57 policemen. A militant website carried a film of him purportedly inside a police building there. The FSB official said it was likely Mr Basayev was involved in the raid, which was led by Magomed Yevloyev, the alleged leader of the Beslan militants. Russia's military said more than a month ago that they had killed Mr Yevloyev after the Ingushetian raids. </p> <p>Public discontent in Beslan grew yesterday, with 3,500 protesters gathering outside the North Ossetian government headquarters. President Alexander Dzasokhov promised to sack his government within two days because of its incompetent handling of the siege.</p>",
  "<p>Damp spirits on Britain's high street were lifted yesterday by a strong sales performance from electrical goods group Dixons and an upbeat message from Woolworths. </p> <p>But supermarket chain Somerfield suffered a summer slowdown, blaming poor weather for the low demand in ice cream, beer and barbecue equipment. </p> <p>Higher interest rates, cooling house prices and the wettest August for 50 years have generally dragged commercial sentiment down. </p> <p>Dixons, however, reported a strong performance from its Currys and PC World chains which enabled it to increase group sales in Britain by 7% in the 18 weeks to September 4. </p> <p>Even the Dixons high street chain - recently the group's weakest business - showed renewed signs of strength. </p> <p>Chief executive John Clare said the company was \"well placed for a year of progress\" but he was anxious not to give firm predictions that the first quarter upturn could be bettered or even maintained. </p> <p>\"Dixons' sales performance is showing some encouraging signs of recovery from last year's levels and The Link (mobile phone retailer) continues to perform well in a growing market,\" he said. </p> <p>International sales at the group rose 13% overall but were flat on a like-for-like basis. </p> <p>Shares in Dixons, which have already performed strongly this year, rose 2% to 163p. </p> <p>Shares in Woolworths were up 3% at 44p after it announced a narrowing of first half losses and a 5.9% increase in sales to \u00a31.1bn. </p> <p>Chief executive Trevor Bish-Jones said the still-recovering company was showing improving sales and margins. </p> <p>\"There are not many retailers who can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" he said. </p> <p>Woolworths - which often records a deficit in the first half and makes 40% of its sales around Christmas - reported a loss before tax and goodwill amortisation of \u00a332.9m, compared with a loss of \u00a334.9m over the same period last year. </p> <p>The company is pressing ahead with modernising its high street stores, setting aside an extra \u00a340m to convert a further 75 stores next year. This comes on top of the 60 outlets that will have been revamped by the end of this month. </p> <p>The stores refitted so far showed a 9% sales increase in the first six months to July 31 and Woolworths said it was confident that forward momentum could be continued. </p> <p>Mr Bish-Jones said the firm was already well-advanced in its plans for the vital Christmas period and had drawn forward its internal calendar by three weeks. </p> <p>This meant that there would be seasonal goods in the stores next month but no Christmas trees or decorations until November because that kind of early celebration \"irritated\" him. </p> <p>Big sellers for December 25 were likely to be DVDs such as Harry Potter and Shrek 2, he said. </p> <p>Mr Bish-Jones confirmed the 100-year old group was selling off some of its out-of-town Big W sites, but said others were being halved in size. </p> <p>Somerfield announced less-encouraging like-for-like sales growth of 1.1% over the first 16 weeks to August 14, including a 0.8% decline in the last two months. </p> <p>The group, which runs Kwik Save as well as Somerfield stores, said sales of ice cream and beers had since recovered to more normal levels. </p> <p>Broker Numis Securities cut its price target for Somerfield from 135p to 115p while Teather and Greenwood reiterated its \"sell\" advice to investors. </p> <p>Shares of Somerfield finished the day down 0.5p at 139p.</p>",
  "For three and a half hours he didn't duck a question, though he occasionally showed flashes of anger and slapped the table to make his point. He didn't take notes, but gave complex answers point by point. <p>If Vladimir Putin was feeling the pressure after possibly his worst week in office, it didn't show. During a rare and wide-ranging interview at his country house outside Moscow, the president enthralled a group of handpicked journalists and academics, giving candid comments that offered surprising insights. </p> <p>He was tough on Chechnya, but soft on George Bush. He castigated the west over terrorism, but was ambivalent about Nato. </p> <p>Addressing questions surrounding the Beslan massacre, Mr Putin elaborated on comments he had made in a national TV address on Saturday evening in which he accused outside powers of wanting to \"tear juicy bits off Russia\" and supporting terrorists who were doing the same thing. </p> <p>\"I didn't say western countries were initiating terrorism, and I didn't say it was policy. But we've observed incidents. It's a replay of the mentality of the cold war. There are certain people who want us to be focused on internal problems and they pull strings here so that we don't raise our heads internationally,\" he said. </p> <p>At several points during the conversation, Mr Putin outlined his fears of a \"domino effect\" if Islamists succeeded in detaching Chechnya from Russia. Other parts of the Caucasus would then go too. He saw a parallel with the collapse of the Soviet Union which he, like many Russians, clearly regretted. </p> <p>He does not want to follow in the footsteps of Mikhail Gorbachev, who is widely reviled for supposedly letting the Soviet Union fall apart. </p> <p>\"Has anyone given a thought to what would happen if Russia were eliminated? We will not allow that to happen. We understand what it would mean for the people of Russia,\" he said, striking the table again with his hand. </p> <p>He said Russia's open southern and central Asian borders could not easily be defended against infiltrators, and would have to be strengthened gradually. But the president made it clear beyond doubt that he had not changed his policy on Chechnya after Beslan. </p> <p>Despite all the differences over Iraq, Mr Putin gave a strong hint yesterday that he is privately hoping that Mr Bush wins the US presidential election. Asked about a poll which showed that 25% of Russians favoured a Kerry victory and only 7% a Bush one, the president smiled and said: \"Russians don't vote in American elections but the 7% includes a few very influential people.\" </p> <p>He then launched into a long paean of praise for his American counterpart. </p> <p>\"Bush is a man of consistency. He's predictable. Even if we have some differences of opinion, for example on Iraq, he's been very reliable. I feel he's a good man, a decent man.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Positive relations between the United States and Russia should be preserved.\" </p> <p>Mr Putin made no mention of the Democratic challenger. </p> <p>Although Russia would not send troops or join in training the Iraqi army and police, he said: \"We want to do everything to normalise things there. I think Bush has done a lot to normalise the situation. Given all the complexities, he's been able to achieve his aims. We will refrain from anything which might be met negatively by the Iraqi people.\" </p> <p>The Russian leader's remarks came during an extraordinary meeting at his country house at Novo Ogaryevo. The participants were veteran experts on Russia, from Britain, the US, France, and Germany, who had been invited for a two-day conference long before the school siege. </p> <p>Fears that pressure of work or irritation with western criticism of his policies in Chechnya might prompt him to cancel the meeting proved unfounded. Although he began stiffly by saying the events of the last few days would probably preclude discussion, he took searching questions. </p> <p>The president frequently smiled as he parried criticisms of his policies or slipped in a few English words like the \"US is a melting pot\" into his answers. On some issues, he even joked. </p> <p>Challenged about the pressure on the media, which saw the editor of the newspaper Izvestiya sacked yesterday - the latest of many recent moves against the independent press - Mr Putin said: \"What about Mr Murdoch's empire? Are his media free?\" </p> <p>On Chechnya, he was angered by what he saw as western hypocrisy. In spite of the west's stated willingness to cooperate on terrorism, \"when we register cases when western special services establish contact with so-called rebels, they say it's an exceptional case, and it won't be repeated, and then they send us a letter saying they need to maintain contacts with all sorts of people\". </p> <p>He singled out Britain and Spain, apparently having in mind the decision by Britain to grant asylum to Akhmed Zakayev, the European envoy of Chechnya's last freely elected president, Aslan Maskhadov. </p> <p>In spite of repeatedly talking about the threat to Russia's future from terrorism, he was relaxed on the other traditional bugbear, Nato. Like Boris Yeltsin, his predecessor, Mr Putin vigorously opposed eastward expansion of Nato. </p> <p>Now he sees Nato as both prone to irrelevance and internal decay, but also as a broadly positive institution. </p> <p>\"We no longer regard Nato as an enemy, nor do we consider it effective from a military point of view. We see it as a political tool,\" he said. \"It's obvious that processes are under way in Nato to find a new opponent. Otherwise what's its point?\" </p> <p>Spelling out even more directly that, in his view, Nato is mainly an instrument for Washington to retain hegemony in Europe, he went on: \"I don't think Nato is so democratically organised. Some members are not very happy with their status.\" </p> <p>With an element of contradiction, he added: \"That being said, I wouldn't want to see Nato's burial. It exists, and it's important for international security and we want international security.\" </p> <p>The Russian leader made it clear he has no problems with neighbouring Ukraine joining the European Union. </p> <p>He was also strongly critical of Georgia and its new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, for attempts to get the breakaway region of South Ossetia back under its rule after 10 years of de facto independence. </p> <p>The Russian president foresaw a scenario in which Georgian troops moved into the rebel region. </p> <p>\"I suspect they may use force. It won't be productive even if in the initial stage they capture the capital, Tskhinvali. It will be a long and exhausting process,\" he said. </p> <p>Although some analysts have seen a parallel between Russia's military move into Chechnya and Georgia's possible invasion of South Ossetia, Mr Putin clearly saw none. </p> <p>Russia's policy in Chechnya was different. He had organised a referendum in Chechnya in 2003. \"I was the only one in the Russian leadership who favoured the idea. It was a risky decision. But Chechens turned out and voted to stay in Russia,\" he said.</p>",
  "An enormous head of steam has built up behind the view that President Putin is somehow the main culprit in the grisly events in North Ossetia. Soundbites and headlines such as \"Grief turns to anger\", \"Harsh words for government\", and \"Criticism mounting against Putin\" have abounded, while TV and radio correspondents in Beslan have been pressed on air to say that the people there blame Moscow as much as the terrorists. There have been numerous editorials encouraging us to understand - to quote the Sunday Times - the \"underlying causes\" of Chechen terrorism (usually Russian authoritarianism), while the widespread use of the word \"rebels\" to describe people who shoot children shows a surprising indulgence in the face of extreme brutality. <p>On closer inspection, it turns out that this so-called \"mounting criticism\" is in fact being driven by a specific group in the Russian political spectrum - and by its American supporters. The leading Russian critics of Putin's handling of the Beslan crisis are the pro-US politicians Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Ryzhkov - men associated with the extreme neoliberal market reforms which so devastated the Russian economy under the west's beloved Boris Yeltsin - and the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow Centre. Funded by its New York head office, this influential thinktank - which operates in tandem with the military-political Rand Corporation, for instance in producing policy papers on Russia's role in helping the US restructure the \"Greater Middle East\" - has been quoted repeatedly in recent days blaming Putin for the Chechen atrocities. The centre has also been assiduous over recent months in arguing against Moscow's claims that there is a link between the Chechens and al-Qaida. </p> <p>These people peddle essentially the same line as that expressed by Chechen leaders themselves, such as Ahmed Zakaev, the London exile who wrote in these pages yesterday. Other prominent figures who use the Chechen rebellion as a stick with which to beat Putin include Boris Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch who, like Zakaev, was granted political asylum in this country, although the Russian authorities want him on numerous charges. Moscow has often accused Berezovsky of funding Chechen rebels in the past. </p> <p>By the same token, the BBC and other media sources are putting it about that Russian TV played down the Beslan crisis, while only western channels reported live, the implication being that Putin's Russia remains a highly controlled police state. But this view of the Russian media is precisely the opposite of the impression I gained while watching both CNN and Russian TV over the past week: the Russian channels had far better information and images from Beslan than their western competitors. This harshness towards Putin is perhaps explained by the fact that, in the US, the leading group which pleads the Chechen cause is the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya (ACPC). The list of the self-styled \"distinguished Americans\" who are its members is a rollcall of the most prominent neoconservatives who so enthusastically support the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>They include Richard Perle, the notorious Pentagon adviser; Elliott Abrams of Iran-Contra fame; Kenneth Adelman, the former US ambassador to the UN who egged on the invasion of Iraq by predicting it would be \"a cakewalk\"; Midge Decter, biographer of Donald Rumsfeld and a director of the rightwing Heritage Foundation; Frank Gaffney of the militarist Centre for Security Policy; Bruce Jackson, former US military intelligence officer and one-time vice-president of Lockheed Martin, now president of the US Committee on Nato; Michael Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute, a former admirer of Italian fascism and now a leading proponent of regime change in Iran; and R James Woolsey, the former CIA director who is one of the leading cheerleaders behind George Bush's plans to re-model the Muslim world along pro-US lines. </p> <p>The ACPC heavily promotes the idea that the Chechen rebellion shows the undemocratic nature of Putin's Russia, and cultivates support for the Chechen cause by emphasising the seriousness of human rights violations in the tiny Caucasian republic. It compares the Chechen crisis to those other fashionable \"Muslim\" causes, Bosnia and Kosovo - implying that only international intervention in the Caucasus can stabilise the situation there. In August, the ACPC welcomed the award of political asylum in the US, and a US-government funded grant, to Ilyas Akhmadov, foreign minister in the opposition Chechen government, and a man Moscow describes as a terrorist. Coming from both political parties, the ACPC members represent the backbone of the US foreign policy establishment, and their views are indeed those of the US administration. </p> <p>Although the White House issued a condemnation of the Beslan hostage-takers, its official view remains that the Chechen conflict must be solved politically. According to ACPC member Charles Fairbanks of Johns Hopkins University, US pressure will now increase on Moscow to achieve a political, rather than military, solution - in other words to negotiate with terrorists, a policy the US resolutely rejects elsewhere. </p> <p>Allegations are even being made in Russia that the west itself is somehow behind the Chechen rebellion, and that the purpose of such support is to weaken Russia, and to drive her out of the Caucasus. The fact that the Chechens are believed to use as a base the Pankisi gorge in neighbouring Georgia - a country which aspires to join Nato, has an extremely pro-American government, and where the US already has a significant military presence - only encourages such speculation. Putin himself even seemed to lend credence to the idea in his interview with foreign journalists on Monday. </p> <p>Proof of any such western involvement would be difficult to obtain, but is it any wonder Russians are asking themselves such questions when the same people in Washington who demand the deployment of overwhelming military force against the US's so-called terrorist enemies also insist that Russia capitulate to hers? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Laughland is a trustee of the British Helsinki Human Rights Group <a href=\"http://www.oscewatch.org\">www.oscewatch.org</a></p>",
  "Forecasts of John Kerry's political demise may have been exaggerated in recent days, and he could still be clinging to a narrow lead in the US presidential race, according to a poll published yesterday. <p>The poll, by Zogby International, reflected the state of play in 20 swing states, and found that the surge in George Bush's support there after last week's Republican convention, was less pronounced than the double-digits suggested in two weekend polls. </p> <p>Those surveys, in Time and Newsweek, triggered alarm and finger-pointing in the Democratic camp, and a reshuffle in the Kerry team. But other surveys have since suggested the Bush convention \"bounce\" was much smaller and the contest remains a close one. </p> <p>The Zogby poll says the president has made up ground in many of the 20 battleground states, but Mr Kerry retains a slim lead in most of them - enough to give him a majority in the electoral college, if the vote was held now. </p> <p>The college, which chooses the president, is made up of 538 delegates drawn from the 50 states and Washington DC, according to population. Assigning electors according to the way each state is leaning now, the Zogby poll gives Mr Kerry a lead of 273 to 222, down from the past two months, but a significant edge all the same. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt that Bush got a bounce ... but no way is he up 11 points,\" John Zogby, the head of Zogby International, said yesterday. </p> <p>Newsweek showed the Mr Bush with an 11 percentage point lead among registered voters, while Time gave him a nine-point lead. But another survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today showed only a one-point advantage. </p> <p>The confusion may reflect the volatility that follows the impassioned speeches and allegations made at conventions. It may also be explained by different surveying methods, and some of it is simply a result of polls being taken over the Labour Day holiday weekend, when many Americans are away from home. </p> <p>Charlie Cook, an experienced US election analyst, said: \"To be dependent upon getting a representative sample over a holiday weekend is enough to make any pollster wince. Polling conducted this week, after people are back from Labour Day and had a chance to digest the Republican convention, will be a far better test.\" </p> <p>US electoral history suggests that leads established at party conventions can often dissipate in the last two frenetic months of the campaign. Al Gore had a double-digit lead over Mr Bush after the Labour day weekend in 2000, but lost it after lacklustre performances in the three presidential debates. </p> <p>Mr Bush, who had not previously shown much aptitude for public speaking, surprised many doubters by avoiding serious mistakes and scoring a few points in the debates. Mr Kerry must hope to do better than his Democratic predecessor in knocking his opponent off balance. </p> <p>The Zogby results suggest the president's emphasis on his role as a wartime leader at the New York convention helped him reassert control in traditionally conservative southern states where Mr Kerry had been making headway before August, such as North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. But elsewhere the Democratic contender is holding on, and in some states - Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington - has even strengthened his position since the attacks made on his fitness to be America's commander-in-chief. </p> <p>Matthew Dowd and Doug Sosnik, top strategists in the Bush and Kerry camps respectively, both predict that as the race nears the November 2 finishing line, money and manpower will increasingly focus on three large swing states, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have a combined total of 68 electoral college votes. </p> <p>Both candidates have been spending more and more time campaigning there. Mr Bush is due to inspect storm damage in Florida today before heading to Pennsylvania. Mr Kerry will be in Cincinnati, Ohio. </p> <p>Both Mr Dowd and Mr Sosnik forecast that whoever wins two of the three big battlegrounds will probably be the next president. </p> <p>At present, according to Zogby, Mr Bush is ahead in Ohio by 11 points. Mr Kerry has a smaller edge of three points in Pennsylvania. Florida is a dead heat, as it has been for much of the year. By that reckoning, this election could be fought and won once more in the Sunshine State, currently being pummelled by hurricanes, just as it was four years ago.</p>",
  "The US today drafted a resolution to the UN security council, threatening Sudan with sanctions on its oil output if does not rein in Arab militia fighters in the Darfur region. <p>The text, seen by Reuters, demands Sudan submits the names of Janjaweed militiamen it has disarmed and arrested for abuses, and calls for the establishment of an enlarged African Union monitoring force with an extended mandate.</p> <p>It does not set a deadline by which Sudan must comply, but diplomats have told the news agency that one could be added during negotiations with council members.</p> <p>The Janjaweed are accused of killing, raping and driving out villagers in Darfur, allegedly with the tacit support of the national government in Khartoum. More than one million people have been driven from their land over the last 18 months.</p> <p>A UN report published yesterday said the Janjaweed had attacked two villages in the region during the past week, despite the government's commitment to disarm the militias and protect civilians.</p> <p>The report added that security was becoming an increasing problem in Darfur, with incidents of banditry - including the armed robbery of cash and communications equipment from two clearly marked UN vehicles - more widespread.</p> <p>\"Agencies fear the security situation may further deteriorate. Reported clashes between GoS [Sudanese government] and [rebel] forces have been compounded by increasing incidents of armed robbery, including on humanitarian workers, mainly in north and south Darfur states,\" the report said.</p> <p>The security council threatened to consider imposing unspecified \"international measures\" in its July 30 resolution if Sudan failed to disarm and prosecute the Janjaweed. The new draft resolution threatens punitive measures \"including with regard to the petroleum sector\" or against individual members of the government. </p> <p>Sanctions have a slim chance of gaining approval this time around, but the US wants to increase the pressure on Khartoum so that punitive measures are more likely to be adopted in the future.</p> <p>Sudan has said it will accept an increase in the 80 African Union monitors and 300 troops deployed to protect them, but has warned it will not do so if their mandate is expanded. The draft resolution calls for the African Union monitors to investigate all abuses, and visit refugee camps.</p> <p>The fighting in Darfur began in February last year following a ceasefire deal in Sudan's civil war which split oil revenues and land between the Arab northern and black southern Sudanese. </p> <p>Rebels in Darfur, in the west, demanded a fairer deal for the region's black African population, taking up arms against government forces and installations. Khartoum responded by arming the Arab Janjaweed militias, who gained the upper hand over the rebels.</p> <p>The Janjaweed then escalated the fight by driving African villagers from their homes and into camps, and the UN estimates that around 50,000 people have been killed. The World Food Programme has said heavy rains and fighting between rebel and government forces have created access problems for its aid workers.</p> <p>Khartoum has said it does not control the Janjaweed - whom it describes as outlaws - and is not responsible for their actions. </p> <p>Angelo Beda, the deputy speaker of the Sudanese parliament, this week described the Janjaweed as a \"a gang of thugs\", and accused the US of conspiring against Sudan's government.</p> <p>\"Sudan is not afraid of the threat of sanctions by the United States, which is using the crisis in Darfur to weaken and destroy the government of Sudan in a similar fashion in which they devastated Iraq and Somalia,\" he told a press conference in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.</p> <p>The Sudanese government and Darfur rebels have been holding peace talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, but progress has been slow. On Tuesday, analysts said the talks had reached an impasse because of weak diplomatic pressure on the rebels.</p>",
  "The Home Office proposed today to make legal immigrants in the UK pay up to four times more for vital travel documents and visas to offset the cost of dealing with illegal immigrants. <p>The immigration minister, Des Browne, outlined plans to raise \u00a3100m by hiking fees for work permit holders, foreign students and spouses, and travel documents for those without a passport from their own country. The increased charges would save the taxpayer the cost of trying and deporting illegal immigrants and those who have over-stayed their visas, the Home Office said.</p> <p>\"It is only right that those who benefit from the immigration service meet the costs of providing it,\" he said, introducing the consultation document. </p> <p>The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) denounced the proposals, suggesting that they could cause skills shortages in healthcare, catering, food processing and cleaning, among other sectors. </p> <p>\"The people who benefit from immigration should pay for it, but we think that really means the UK economy and UK businesses,\" a JCWI spokeswoman said. </p> <p>She warned that the proposals would penalise poor migrants from developing countries looking to get onto the first rung of the job ladder.</p> <p>\"If Des Browne imposes this kind of charge on low-skilled migrants, he could wind up sitting in a very dirty office,\" she said.</p> <p>From April, a travel document for asylum seekers granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK for humanitarian reasons would rise four-fold from \u00a367 to \u00a3270. The cost a visa on the highly skilled migrant programme could rise from \u00a3150 to \u00a3375, and extending a work permit may rise \u00a3121 to \u00a3300. Extending a student or spouse's visa could rise from \u00a3250 to \u00a3495 for a premium service, while the visa scheme intended to allow workers into the UK to work in hospitality and food processing sectors may see prices rise from \u00a3153 to \u00a3270. </p> <p>The Home Office raised \u00a370m from visa charges over the last financial year.</p> <p>Businesses and other organisations will have until December to comment on the plans. </p> <p>\"It is clearly in our interest to welcome genuine overseas students and workers with the skills we need to contribute to the UK and our economy. However these benefits are reciprocal,\" Mr Browne said. </p> <p>\"The fees we are proposing are proportionate and necessary to ensure that we can deliver a self-financing migration programme which continues to provide an efficient service to its customers, while regulating entry and taking action against those who do not have a right to be here.\"</p> <p>The JCWI said discouraging migrants through increased fees could also cost the UK directly by putting more pressure on aid budgets. The spokeswoman said migrant workers from the developing world remitted more money to their families and home countries than the combined aid budgets of developed nations. </p> <p>\"By penalising low-skilled workers, you are frustrating a very important channel of development,\" she said.</p>",
  "Russia's security service, the FSB, today promised a reward of up to \u00a35.8m for information that could help to \"neutralise\" Chechen rebel leaders. <p>Moscow has accused Shamil Basayev and Aslan Maskhadov of masterminding the school hostage crisis in the North Ossetian town of Beslan last week that left more than 350 people dead.</p> <p>The FSB, a successor of the KGB, today blamed the rebel leaders for causing \"inhuman terrorist acts\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the president of North Ossetia, Alexander Dzasokhov, said that the regional government would step down in the next two days. </p> <p>He said: \"We are doing this because many problems have piled up that need to be solved better.\" </p> <p>Addressing an angry crowd of around 1,000 demonstrators at regional government headquarters, Mr Dzasokhov also pledged to resign himself if he could not fulfil their demands.</p> <p>The protesters were demanding the resignation of regional government and security officials and the formation of independent regional and national commissions to investigate the atrocity.</p> <p>Speaking from a balcony, Mr Dzasokhov repeated his appeal for time. \"I won't flee anywhere, and you also won't leave,\" he said, according to the Interfax news agency.</p> <p>But the crowd was implacable, shouting \"Resign! Resign!\" </p> <p>Some demanded to know why he had not met the hostage-takers demand to enter negotiations with them. \"I was ready to go but, you understand, we were dealing with bandits,\" Mr Dzasokhov shouted hoarsely. </p> <p>In another development, the chief of the Russian general staff, Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky, reasserted Russia's right to mount \"preventive strikes\" against terrorists abroad. \"We will take all measures to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world,\" the senior military official said.</p> <p>Also today Russia criticised the US for having in the past held talks with Chechens pressing for independence and suggested that the issue could harm bilateral relations, Interfax reported.</p> <p>\"We solve our internal problems ourselves, and there's no need to search for an American route to political normalisation in Chechnya,\" the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said. </p> <p>While joining in condemnation of last week's atrocity, the US state department said yesterday that Russia ultimately had to hold political talks with Chechen leaders and reach a settlement. </p> <p>A US state department spokesman said US officials had met with Chechens with a variety of views in the past, but said: \"We do not meet with terrorists.\" The spokesman said that there could be additional meetings in future, although none were currently planned.</p> <p>The Russian foreign ministry announced that it would take new steps to seek the extradition of people it claims are linked to terrorism, including Chechen rebel political representatives Akhmed Zakayev and Ilyas Akhmadov. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev, an envoy for Mr Maskhadov, the separatist leader and former Chechen president, has been granted refugee status in the UK, while Mr Akhmadov is in the US.</p> <p>The ministry said the hostage-taking, and other recent attacks, would \"help many in the west, where Zakayev and Akhmadov have found political asylum, to see the true face of terror and understand the measure of their delusion\". </p> <p>Speaking in the UK, Mr Zakayev, who has called the school siege \"a monstrous act\", said any renewed attempt to have him extradited would be a smoke screen. A judge at Bow Street magistrates court ruled last November that there was a \"substantial risk\" that Mr Zakayev would be tortured if he returned to Russia. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev said today: \"We have a British court decision that is clear ... we think Russia is doing this because they want to take away attention from the murders in Beslan.\" </p> <p>The Itar-Tass news agency reported that two suspected bombers were detained in Chechnya yesterday.</p> <p>The two women, residents of the Chechen town of Shali, were suspected of taking part in terrorist activities, the agency, citing the Chechen regional branch of the FSB, said. </p> <p>Russians last night got a horrific glimpse of conditions inside the school seized by militants last week when a television station broadcast images of the heavily armed and hooded assailants amid the crowd of women, children and men.</p>",
  "<p><strong> March 18 2004 </strong><br> </p> <p> One of the unsettling things about cellular living is that the jail authorities can randomly uproot an inmate at any time and transplant him into a new environment. During my two-year stay at the jail, I have been rolled-up (moved) several times. A new cell equals a new garrison of cockroaches to battle and I have learned to travel armed with AmerFresh Fluoride toothpaste, which blocks cockroach entry points very effectively. </p> <p>On Tuesday our whole pod was moved to a different floor and I used my entire stock of AmerFresh to seal the numerous cockroach-launching points. The new cell was quickly and expertly fortified against the enemy. That night I slept soundly. Little did I know that the jail was about to sabotage my hard work. </p> <p>On Wednesday I was moved back to my original floor and into one of the most cockroach-infested pods in the building. I was completely unarmed and helplessly watched the insects size me up from myriad cracks in the walls. The lights were still on, but I knew that by night time I would be doomed. My new cellmate and I didn't get much sleep, but lay awake watching the legions of cockroaches conquer the room. Whirling around us, they swarmed the floor, the walls, the ceiling, our commissary bags and, finally, our bunks. </p> <p><strong> March 25 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am allowed out of my cell for one hour each day to make a phone call and to take a shower. During my first \"hour out\" in the new pod, I was serenaded by the inmates, who performed a husky version of Yellow Submarine. I was touched by their vocal efforts and their demonstration of high spirits. </p> <p>My new co-habitants are enduring the twin evils of a broken swamp-cooler and a cockroach infestation. They are proving to be the creme de la creme of good sufferers. A neighbouring asthmatic inmate happily described how he inhaled a cockroach that had crept into his nebuliser. He could feel the insect crawling around inside him and promptly vomited his stomach contents. Unfortunately the cockroach was not ejected, as it was lodged in his lung. He was subsequently awarded \"sufferer of the week\" without any real competition. (\"Sufferer of the week\" was an idea of mine that has delighted and distracted my fellow inmates. The title is given to the inmate whom the rest of the pod feel has suffered most.) </p> <p>My cellmate and I have used six tubes of AmerFresh toothpaste and six ounces of Razorless Beard Remover cementing cracks in the walls. The cockroaches still flood our cell every night and I have awoken several times this week to observe my body hair stood up on end and a cockroach crawling on my person. I had previously considered my ape-like fur coating as one of nature's cruel jokes, but now I have discovered that it is a useful defensive shield. </p> <p><strong> April Fool's day </strong><br> </p> <p> My cellmate Mark is stuck at the \"unable-to-eat-the-jail-food\" stage. Approximately three months ago, Mark suffered his first ever arrest, and he has shed 30lbs while in the hoosegow [jail]. His main source of sustenance is the inmate canteen order form, from which he mostly orders Cheez-its, chips (assorted), Granola bars and mixed nuts. Slimmed-down-Mark no longer resembles his booking photo, because he barely touches the jail offerings. </p> <p>Prison inmates who get transferred to the jail joke about how luxurious prison food is vis-a-vis jail meals. (Jail is where unsentenced prisoners are housed and prison is where you go when you are sentenced.) In jail, chow is served twice each day. Breakfast arrives at 8.30am and consists of six slices of stale white bread (the probability of colourful mould growing on a slice is 33%), raw breakfast meat (the probability of it being bologna is 50%, green bologna is 25%), grapefruits or oranges collected during neighbourhood refuse clean-up campaigns (the probability of them being rotten is 50%), one packet of stale and bright orange-coloured, bordering on luminous, cheese crackers, and a beverage, which is a half-pint of fat-free milk. </p> <p>The evening's below-lukewarm culinary delights consist of unsalted boiled potatoes (the probability of receiving a mound of potato peel encrusted with dirt is 25%; of human hair being discovered in the spuds is 25%), mystery meat slop (the probability of a dead rat in the stew is minimal, though I did see a rat's head served in 2002), a vegetable (the probability of leathery eggplant is 25%), a small, undressed salad, more stale bread and a cup of brightly coloured juice, which, if spilled, makes a permanent stain on the table. As I am a yoga-practising vegetarian, I receive peanut butter and veggie burgers as substitutes for the meat. </p> <p><strong> April 15 </strong><br> </p> <p>I received lots of eggs on Easter Sunday: cockroach eggs. I noticed something that looked like a piece of a worm glued to my dictionary. It was full of cockroach larvae. I discovered two more empty egg containers nearby. More nests were discovered in my legal file, and my commissary bag. I poured the contents of one envelope into the toilet, but in the time it took to press the flush button, las cucarachas had scurried out of the toilet bowl and were scrambling around my feet. </p> <p>They were none too happy about their encampment being besieged on a Holy Day, and as darkness came they began to rebel en masse. Numerous baby cockroaches, tinier than ants, started a demonstration. They zigzagged on every wall like minuscule bumper cars. They were soon joined by adult members of their community. One about the size of an almond crawled on to my foot. Several larger ones appeared on the blanket near my right shoulder, and I had to sleep with a sheet wrapped around my head because I feared they had performed a reconnaissance of my upper-body orifices. </p> <p>Mark (my celly) was very disturbed. He stayed awake for most of the night, but when his eyelids finally closed, he dreamed that they were crawling all over him and woke in a terrible sweat, scratching at his body, only to discover that his dream had come true. </p> <p>The law clearly states that \"pre-sentence detainees\" have the right not to live in an insect-infested environment, but the jail continuously flouts the law by showing the external referees their insecticide-spraying records. In fact, the insecticide is sprayed on the inmates and the only effect it has upon the roaches is as a temporary intoxicant. On spray day they act like drunkards stumbling home from the pub, but they quickly sober up. </p> <p>I placed a whole green onion from my dinner tray into a polystyrene cup. I half-filled it with water and, to my delight, it started to grow roots. Now I have a plant of my very own to love and care for! I haven't seen a plant for years! Mark is starting to suspect I've been here too long. </p> <p><strong> April 22 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am a bibliomaniac! I have read 29 books in the last three months, some of which were more than 1,000 pages long. I read for up to 12 hours every day. There are two difficulties associated with being a jailhouse bookworm. The first is bleeding bedsores - I currently have one on my left buttock - and the second is dealing with the mailroom. </p> <p>My first run-in with the mailroom occurred last year when they rejected Security Analysis, a hardback book containing more than 1,000 pages. The mail rejection notification stated that the book was not a book, but actually a \"weapon\". Then last autumn I was denied some Karl Marx. The mail rejection notification stated that I was \"jeopardising the safety of the jail operation\". This past week, I was denied three books that were ordered from <a href=\"http://www.traderspress.com\">www.traderspress.com</a>. The mail rejection notification stated that \"books must be delivered directly from the publisher or online dist [sic]\". As traderspress.com is both a publisher and online distributor, I lodged a complaint, using an inmate grievance form. I was visited by a friendly hearing officer who stated that the mail room officer had made an error and that the jail would accept redelivery. I reordered the books at the cost of an additional redelivery fee and I thought that would be the end of the matter. Unfortunately, the mail room officer had been offended by my complaint and I received a retaliatory, threatening note taped to my Wall St Journal. The note stated: \"You need to contact the Wall St Journal and advise them of your new facility/bunk no. All papers from now on will be thrown away . . . Mail Officer.\" </p> <p>Upon analysing these notices, I have concluded that the mailroom has determined that I am a weapon-seeking revolutionary. The threat to throw away my newspapers seems to be a call to arms. </p> <p><strong> May 13 </strong><br> </p> <p>Frankie, an alleged Mexican mafia contract killer, is the source of most of the hullabaloo in our pod. Last month Frankie was calmly playing cards in a maximum-security pod when an eight-inch shank was suddenly plunged into the back of his neck. Unfazed, he extracted the shank, and was about to return the gesture, when guards pepper-sprayed him, causing temporary blindness. He was consequently promoted to our pod - a super-maximum area, where inmates are confined to tiny two-man cells for 23 hours every day. </p> <p>Frankie looks and acts like Joe Pesci in a mobster movie. He wears his thick, black hair slicked back, and his arms are heavily prison-tattooed. He overcompensates for his Napoleonic height with a cocksure manner, but the inmates have warmed to his lewd wittiness. He has previously served a 17-year sentence, and during that time he became a chess heavyweight. During my one hour out, I usually play a game of chess with him, through his cell window. His piercing hazel eyes and fiendish grin animate his attempts at psychological warfare . . . </p> <p>\"Eat dat fuckin' pawn!\" </p> <p>\"Let me fuckin' teach yer somethin'!\" </p> <p>\"Eat dat fuckin' bishop!\" </p> <p>\"Watch dis! Check! Trick move! What'd fuckin' tell ya!\" </p> <p>\"Don't do it!\" </p> <p>\"Move my bitch (queen) all da way up!\" </p> <p>\"Check-fuckin'-mate! Boo yah!!\" </p> <p>\"Nobody fucks wiv da champ!\" </p> <p>My green onion plant, which had sprouted six inches, suddenly wilted and died. </p> <p><strong> May 20 </strong><br> </p> <p>Hue and cry outside the jailhouse on Saturday morning - a public protest to bring attention to the jail's \"character-building\" conditions. The sheriff's [Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio] swift response was to serve us with tasty mashed potatoes instead of the usual boiled potato peelings. On Sunday night we actually received a scoop of ice cream. Unfortunately, the ice cream was served on top of warm cabbage, causing it to metamorphose into cabbage soup. No matter, we appreciated the gesture, and we are still being served the delicious mashed potatoes. </p> <p>The daily temperatures are now in excess of 38C (100F) and rising. The air is stale and debilitating. On Monday an inmate told a guard that he felt ill and requested medical treatment. The guard told him to drink plenty of water and to lie down. The inmate persisted, stating that he was a diabetic and really needed to see the doctor, but the guard continued to fob him off. On Monday night the inmate slipped into a diabetic coma and was rushed to the hospital. He has not been seen since. </p> <p><strong> May 27 </strong><br> </p> <p>Two more inmates collapsed and were taken to the medical unit. Rumours abound that the diabetic who entered a coma last week may have died, and that the jail is under investigation. We have been told for the past three months that the swamp cooler is \"broken\" and that a \"work order\" has been entered, but, lo and behold, when the county health department inspected the jail on Tuesday and Wednesday, the air was miraculously blowing at gale force and our shower water was running hot enough to redden my skin. When the inspectors left the building someone immediately switched the air back to the \"broken\" setting. </p> <p>I received a large photograph in the mail. It exceeded the 4 x 6 inches allowed by the jail, so I was pleasantly surprised that it was not rejected by the trigger-happy mailroom. It was a picture of a bespectacled President Bush signing some important-looking documents. In the lower margin was a personalised message with my name on it. It read: \"Thank you for your support of the Republican National Committee. Grassroots leaders like you are the key to building a better, stronger, more secure future for our nation and all Americans . . . Best Wishes, George W Bush.\" </p> <p><strong> June 3 </strong><br> </p> <p>In this Hades, intravenous drug use is the hobby of the majority. Dozens of haunted men eagerly play Russian roulette by sharing one \"rig\" (syringe). Deadly diseases, including hepatitis C and TB, are common. The illegal drug use is only half of the story. Three times a day, a crotchety nurse goes from cell to cell dispensing \"meds\". Roughly one-third of the inmates are recipients of these pill cocktails. The most heavily pushed prescriptions are for Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Prozac, Paxil, Haldol, Elavil and Seroquel. </p> <p>The inmates snigger at how easy it is to obtain free drugs. They simply tell the psych doctor that they are \"hearing voices\" or are \"unable to sleep\". The jail's Big Kahuna [Arpaio] regularly appears on TV boasting that it costs the taxpayer a pittance to feed society's refuse, but he never mentions the millions of dollars being spent on expensive \"meds\", which the drug companies are profiting from handsomely. </p> <p>It's been an infernally \"normal week\". Outdoor temperatures are approaching 110F, and we are slowly being brought to the boil. Mark and I now catch one another chasing imaginary cockroaches. </p> <p>The dirty potato peelings are back as the main course among the diarrhoea-inducing expired eatables. Bone-dry citrus fruits are the new additions to breakfast. The stench of filth and sweat pervades the air. The bedsore on my left buttock is blistered and bleeding. My mouth and tongue are ulcerated. This joyless maltreatment is clearly designed to chafe one's happy-go-lucky disposition. The allure of being consigned to the grave can become an unremitting thought, as evidenced by the periodic suicides. </p> <p><strong> June 17 </strong><br> </p> <p> On Friday morning, the guards thwarted an escape attempt by two inmates. Despite the fact that they had botched the job, the jail administration decided to punish everyone. We were placed on \"Security Override\" for four consecutive days, during which we were confined to our cells, unable to shower, make phone calls or dispose of our trash and dinner trays. Soaring temperatures and a purposefully low trickle of swamp-cooled air quickly caused us to stink like wet dogs. </p> <p>Las cucarachas launched the most aggressive offensive that I have ever witnessed. I observed several divisions besiege our cell, consisting mostly of large, brown foot soldiers, a few white colonels, and one pregnant queen, carrying a dreaded baby capsule. </p> <p>The conditions have tipped Eric, a 50-year-old inmate, into a nervous breakdown. Early Monday morning, he started yelling, \"Get me outta here!!!\" repeatedly for 15 minutes. His voice inflection ranged from a demonically possessed adult male - worse than the Exorcist! - to that of a sobbing young child. </p> <p> <strong> June 24 </strong><br> </p> <p> My right shin looks like I have spilled battery acid on it. A skin infection formed last week when we were denied showers and a cluster of approximately 30 bright-red sores has appeared. Some of them are bleeding. </p> <p>Half of the shower area is refusing to drain. Hair matted with semen has clogged it up. To shower I have to step through the odoriferous scum floating in the water. This disturbs a multitude of tiny jet-black flies and they form a cloud around my person. Fortunately they bolt when the shower is turned on, and migrate to the dried fruit peel in the trashcan. When the shower is turned off they return to the shower. They prefer the semen. </p> <p><strong> July 2 </strong><br> </p> <p>Final entry. </p> <p>Periplaneta Americana, more commonly known as the American cockroach, has an average lifespan of 440 days. As of today, I have been a resident of this crowbar motel for almost two cockroach lifespans. I have endured sufficient suffering, and, following in the footsteps of most pre-sentence detainees, I have signed myself over to the prison industrial complex. Shortly, I will be shipped to a Department of Corrections processing facility, where they will decide which state penitentiary is to become my new abode. </p> <p><strong> July 13 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am still at the jail. A sudden spate of tragedies has occurred, compelling me to write this entry. At the weekend two inmates on my floor attempted to commit suicide. One threw himself off the balcony and survived. The other was discovered trying to hang himself. Sadder still, an inmate housed in a medium-security pod was found dead in the shower. Inmates are often \"smashed\" in the shower area because it is out of view of the cameras. The jail has refused to release the cause of his death. </p> <p>The temperature outside is currently 114F. The trickle of air into our cells feels like hot air blowing from a hair-dryer. We are soaked in sweat all day and night. It is difficult to write on this sweat-moistened paper. The majority now have skin infections and rashes, which persistently itch. My skin is so soggy from perspiration that when I scratch it the skin detaches and I end up with clumps of skin under my fingernails. Between the sweat trickling down my body and the cockroaches tickling my limbs, it is impossible to sleep properly. Last night, while sleeping on my side, my ear filled up with sweat, and when I moved my head, the sweat poured out on to my face. I woke up, startled. It felt like someone was touching my cheek. </p> <p>When I was a small child, I imagined that hell consisted of caves in which the damned were trapped, tortured and burned. I imagined serpents and indescribable creepy crawlies tormenting the captives. I never imagined that man's nature could be so hateful as to recreate these conditions on earth. </p> <p>In June, Shaun Attwood pleaded guilty. On July 16, he was moved to a secure processing centre, waiting to be moved to a prison where he will serve the remainder of his nine and a half year sentence. Conditions there are much better. </p> <p><a href=\"http://jonsjailjournal.blogspot.com\">http://jonsjailjournal.blogspot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The popular culture of Liverpool exploded from three legendary live venues, only one of which survives. The Cavern, cradle of the beat boom, is now a car park surrounded by souvenir shops. The fabled upstairs bar at Eric's lingers only in the lyrics and liner notes of the post-punk bands that met and performed there. Only the Everyman Theatre, the famously scruffy home of radical Scouse writing, has clung on to celebrate its 40th birthday this year. </p> <p>The roll call of names that joined the Everyman company in the early 1970s speaks for itself: Jonathan Pryce, Antony Sher, Julie Walters, Pete Postlethwaite and Bill Nighy began their careers there, performing in plays turned out by a stable of house playwrights, including John McGrath, Willy Russell, Alan Bleasdale and Jimmy McGovern. </p> <p>All of Liverpool's artistic community has at one time or another endured the hard wooden pews of the Everyman's boxy, three-sided auditorium, a hangover from the days when the building was a religious meeting house. On any given night in the smoky cellar bistro you might expect to see poet Adrian Henri chatting with film-maker Alex Cox or musician Julian Cope. Bill Drummond of the KLF used to build scenery in the theatre's workshops. Paul McCartney once dropped in unannounced to give a poetry reading. </p> <p>Situated on Hope Street, halfway between the city's two cathedrals, the Everyman has perhaps survived thanks only to the grace of God. But it is unlikely the theatre's founders would have envisaged the venture still being in operation 40 years later. In September 1964, three idealistic young graduates - Peter James, Martin Jenkins and Terry Hands - negotiated a \u00a33,000 grant from Liverpool city council to establish a young people's repertory company in the former Hope Hall meeting house, with an aim to promote a more radical and stripped-down alternative to the traditionally plush Playhouse. </p> <p>For Willy Russell, the new theatre was a revelation. \"The Everyman was tatty and it spoke our language,\" he says. \"It was the first theatre where I actually felt that uneducated scruffs like me were welcomed. At the Playhouse they still stood for the Queen before performances. At the Everyman you could be watching great Shakespeare, or an exciting new musical, sitting on a bag of cement.\" </p> <p>Although James, Jenkins and Hands worked hard to make it a success, the golden age of the Everyman really began with the arrival of Alan Dosser as artistic director in 1970. One of the most underappreciated directors, entrepreneurs and talent scouts in British theatre, Dosser was the man who first convinced Russell and Bleasdale that they could and should write plays. A committed and charismatic socialist, he promoted an outspoken programme of plays that formed an instant link with the lives of the locals. And he had an incredible eye for an actor: Dosser once strolled out of a drama-school showcase after only 20 minutes, but not before leaving a note for Jonathan Pryce, telling him there was a job waiting for him at the Everyman if he was ready to start on Monday. </p> <p>Some of Dosser's Everyman productions went on to become substantial hits. Russell's musical John, Paul, George, Ringo and Bert went on to enjoy a long West End run with Bernard Hill, Trevor Eve, Philip Joseph and Antony Sher as the Fab Four, plus George Costigan as their roadie. The play also launched the career of a young Liverpool folk singer, Barbara Dickson, who was drafted in to provide the music. </p> <p>But many of the plays were more ephemeral: bold as newspaper headlines and swiftly forgotten. \"Whenever a local scandal or intrigue blew up, Alan Dosser would immediately commission a play about it,\" says Bill Nighy, who joined the company in 1973. \"There was once some crooked developer who tried to legitimise a pile of rubble by claiming that he was building a dry ski slope in Kirby. Dosser turned round a wickedly funny play about the ski slope affair in about a fortnight.\" </p> <p>Dosser says his model for the company was Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop. \"I wanted to create a company that was politically committed, anarchic but also fun,\" he says. \"Community theatre sounds like such a cliche these days, but people in Liverpool rarely bother to book. We'd only know if a play was successful if there was a quarter-of-a-mile queue down the road on the second night.\" </p> <p>Great ensembles have a relatively limited shelf life, however, and towards the end of the 1970s the Everyman company began to run out of steam. Russell laments that the pressure to put on issue-based plays eventually began to turn writing for the theatre into a form of social work. Dosser, for his part, recognised that the time had come to call it a day when he turned up for work one morning and found the theatre locked, only to realise it was a Sunday. </p> <p>The 1980s were dark times for the Everyman - and Liverpool in general. The city council was no longer quite as keen to fund an organisation so vocal in its opposition, and repertory companies of 25 actors were no longer regarded as viable. The venue still had its moments: theatrical maverick Ken Campbell took over as artistic director for a year and established his Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool, and former stage carpenter Bill Drummond chose the Everyman to screen the evidence of the K Foundation's notorious burning of \u00a31m. But, unable to support a programme of its own work, it went into liquidation, and was saved in 1993 by a package put together by its bistro. Today the Everyman remains a great cafe with a theatre attached. </p> <p>The confirmation of Liverpool as European Capital of Culture for 2008, meanwhile, has reignited the will to restore the Everyman's identity as the city's pre-eminent mouthpiece and cultural sounding board. In 1998 the Everyman amalgamated with its similarly struggling rival, the Playhouse, and a literary policy was put in place. The product of that has finally begun to emerge and artistic director Gemma Bodinetz has been able to announce a 40th anniversary season that consists entirely of new plays by young Liverpool writers. </p> <p>Whether new playwrights such as Laurence Wilson and Tony Green emerge as worthy successors to Russell and Bleasdale remains to be seen, but both are names to look out for in the forthcoming season. Wilson's Urban Legend features three generations of men in a Bootle high-rise, while Green's The Kindness of Strangers is an ambitious play about asylum-seeking that re-establishes the Everyman tradition of large-cast, epic dramas with music, a political message and, apparently, a goat. </p> <p>\"The Everyman is the kind of place we take for granted in Liverpool until it's too late,\" says singer Pete Wylie, whose band Wah! Heat played their first gig at the theatre in 1979. \"But it was a place that allowed us to be loud, bohemian and pretentious, which was precisely what we needed at the time.

  "In a career that touched seven decades, the actor Frederick Jaeger, who has died aged 76, managed to escape typecasting by dividing his time between the stage, radio, television and film, adapting his talents to every genre. He was also an active and distinguished member of the council of the actors' union Equity for 10 years. <p>Jaeger was born in Berlin, but, following the Nazi takeover in 1933, fled with his family, first to France and then England, to escape Hitler's persecution of the Jews. This cosmopolitan and turbulent childhood prepared him well for a career playing different nationalities and classes, and, by 1948, he had graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and was in constant demand. </p> <p>His 47-year theatre career began in 1949, and included a number of West End appearances. He had great success as Ramble in Lock Up Your Daughters (1959), at the Mermaid Theatre, and reprised the role in a tour of America. He also toured Europe and Latin America, playing in Shakespeare with Ralph Richardson. </p> <p>Jaeger's early film credits are telling. In The Black Tent (1956), The One That Got Away (1957), I Was Monty's Double (1958) and Ice Cold In Alex (1958), he played respectively, a junior Nazi officer, a German prisoner, a junior German officer and a second German officer, despite having become a British citizen in 1950 and painstakingly removed all trace of his natural accent. Although he was to play many more Nazis in television productions in this country (Selling Hitler, 1991) and in the US (The Nightmare Years, 1989), there was more to him than that. </p> <p>He starred in Carla Lane's thoughtful and touching tragi-comedy I Woke Up One Morning (1985), displaying a moving fragility and vulnerability as Derek, one of four recovering alcoholics around whom the two series revolved. </p> <p>An early lead had come in 1966, when Jaeger played a dual role in the espionage thriller The Man In The Mirror, and he was also Professor Bhaer in Little Women (1970), a regular in the popular series Special Branch, playing Commander Fletcher (1974), the industrialist Max Langemann in Take The High Road (1980), Chief Constable Melchett in The Body In The Library (1984) and Dr Mudal in John Schlesinger's production of Cold Comfort Farm (1995). </p> <p>He escaped being typecast as a heavy, partly because of his malleable appearance - burly frame, large watery eyes and permanently lined brow - and partly because he could be very, very funny; he was a hoot as a humourless head of comedy in The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin (1978), and collaborated well with Barry Took on N.U.T.S and One-Upmanship (both 1976). </p> <p>His guest-starring roles were an immediate indication of quality in series as diverse as The Avengers (three appearances in the 1960s), Callan (1969), Doctor Who (three appearances, including playing the creator of the popular robot dog K-9), Remington Steele (Pierce Brosnan's successful US comedy thriller, 1984), Keeping Up Appearances (1990) and The Chief (1990). </p> <p>Jaeger's many film credits included The Looking Glass War (1969), based on a John Le Carr\u00e9 book and starring Anthony Hopkins, Henrik Ibsen in Song Of Norway (1970), The Seven Per Cent Solution (1976), Voyage Of The Damned (1976) and Nijinsky (1980). </p> <p>His first marriage, to Hazel Penwarden, was dissolved in 1972. He married Elizabeth Griffiths in 1973, and after his retirement, in 1996, moved with her to a farmhouse in Mallorca, where he died after a long illness. She survives him. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Manfred Frederick Jaeger, actor, born May 29 1928; died June 18 2004</p>"
