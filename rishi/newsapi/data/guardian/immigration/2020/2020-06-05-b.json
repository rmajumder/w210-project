a strong appeal to protesters not to take part in demonstrations this weekend.</p> \n  <p>PSNI assistant chief constable Alan Todd said his officers are engaging with organisers of <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> gatherings to explain the coronavirus regulations, adding if the warnings are ignored then enforcement will be used.</p> \n  <p>He made the comments ahead of three planned demonstrations across Northern Ireland this weekend over the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US last week.</p> \n  <p>Todd described the protest as \u201cvalid\u201d but warned that public gatherings of more than six people are against coronavirus regulations, as is travelling for a protest.</p> \n  <p>Up to 2,000 people gathered in Belfast city centre on Wednesday to express their support for the Black Lives Matter campaign.</p> \n  <p>The first minister <strong>Arlene Foster</strong> described it as a breach of the law and urged that there should be no repeat of it, while the deputy first minister <strong>Michelle O\u2019Neill </strong>said she was fully supportive of the BLM campaign but urged those involved to find other ways to show solidarity.</p> \n  <p>Todd said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have a very clear message to organisers, the best way to resolve this for everybody\u2019s interests is to call off these events.</p> \n   <p>Large crowd protests are at this time inappropriate.</p> \n   <p>If people choose to ignore these warnings and with all the advice and guidance from the chief medical officer, healthcare professionals, from police, from political representatives across the spectrum, if people choose to ignore all that and break the law then there will have to be consequences.</p> \n   <p>People can take my messaging today as being my engagement with them, my explanation, and my encouraging them to obey the law - if they choose to ignore the first three Es they can expect over the weekend to find enforcement being used.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On any other day as a police service we would be fully facilitating those protests in a peaceful and lawful manner with the organisers, however this is not any other day, we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and gathering in crowds, socially distanced or otherwise, is both a risk to public health and a breach of the health protection regulations.</p> \n   <p>It seems to be somewhat ironic that we would protest the avoidable and unnecessary death of an individual in the United

  "<p>A consensus that international cooperation is required to limit the danger from global heating has existed for decades. The success of the rearguard action against this knowledge, led by fossil fuel interests, is a catastrophe whose full extent is yet to unfold. Central bankers are now demanding that a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/05/world-climate-breakdown-pandemic#maincontent\" title=\"\">whole economy transition</a>\u201d must follow the pandemic if the world is to avoid the extreme disruption that temperature rises of 4C would bring.</p> <p>Arguably, the chaos unleashed by coronavirus has made such a future seem less remote, and action to prevent it more necessary. The risk is that the virus will have the opposite effect: focusing minds on the threat right now rather than the one that can be ignored for a few more years.</p> <p>Nowhere is this danger greater than in Brazil. South America\u2019s most populous country is responsible for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions\" title=\"\">2.25% of global emissions</a> (by comparison, the US, with a population 50% bigger, emits seven times as much). But accelerating deforestation places Brazil, which has 60% of the Amazon rainforest within its borders, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/amazon-matter-of-life-and-death-for-all-of-us-we-must-fight-for-it\" title=\"\">heart of the struggle</a> to prevent runaway global heating. That is because the Amazon is the planet\u2019s biggest terrestrial carbon sink and plays a crucial role in the water cycle, as well as providing a home to more species than anywhere else on land.</p> <p>Twenty-eight years ago, in June 1992, the UN framework convention on climate change was opened for signature in Rio de Janeiro. But since Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, took office 18 months ago his government has sabotaged years of work by environmentalist and indigenous activists aimed at protecting the rainforest, and instead fanned the flames of its destruction by illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers. In the year to July 2019, losses rocketed to 9,800 sq km and research predicts that the rainforest is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/tropical-forests-losing-their-ability-to-absorb-carbon-study-finds\" title=\"\">on course for a tipping point</a> that would see it become a carbon emitter in the mid-2030s. Now there are fears that the coronavirus pandemic may speed this up.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-brazil-record-daily-death-toll-mexico\" title=\"\">Brazil overtook Italy</a> to become the country with the third-highest Covid-19 death toll (behind the US and UK), after a daily record of 1,743 fatalities took the total to more than 34,000. While Mr Bolsonaro continues to attack public health measures, the indigenous population of the Amazon region appears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/brazil-using-coronavirus-to-cover-up-assaults-on-amazon-warn-activists#maincontent\" title=\"\">increasingly under threat</a> from violence as well as disease, with five killings in Maranh\u00e3o state in six months.</p> <p>The tropical rainforest may seem distant. But we cannot afford to wring our hands and look away. Every possible lever must be pulled that could influence Brazil\u2019s government and meat industry. This week, the Guardian reported that UK banks have provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/04/revealed-uk-banks-and-investors-2bn-backing-of-meat-firms-linked-to-amazon-deforestation\" title=\"\">more than $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in backing</a> to companies linked to deforestation. Those institutions must now come under pressure, along with US investors such as BlackRock. So must politicians and regulators.</p> <p>It will take a huge international effort to preserve the Amazon rainforest. Agribusiness is responsible for more than one-fifth of Brazil\u2019s GDP. If the cattle industry is to face curbs, there must also be incentives. International trade and climate negotiators have their work cut out. There is a job to be done by public opinion too.</p>",
  "<p>When the 2019-20 W-League season <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/w-league-grand-final-offered-an-answer-to-footballs-existential-question\">wrapped up in March</a>, it became the last professional football league in the world to complete a full calendar unaffected by the coronavirus shutdown.</p> <p>While the grand final between Melbourne City and Sydney FC was played in front of a skeleton crowd of family and friends, the game itself went ahead as planned. By virtue of its short season length, the league managed to slide in under the world\u2019s lockdowns, like Indiana Jones beneath a rapidly descending stone doorway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/anson-dorrance-we-raise-young-women-to-not-be-competitive-what-the-heck-is-going-on\">Anson Dorrance: 'We raise young women to not be competitive. What the heck is going on?' | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the simile doesn\u2019t end there: Football Federation Australia has proved itself a nimble and adaptable figure internationally, too. Earlier this year, in the space of just two weeks, the organisation negotiated moving the Matildas\u2019 entire Olympic qualifying group from Wuhan to Sydney, including organising stadiums, hotels and training grounds for all four participating national teams. The league responded well to those shifting calendars, moving a handful of games around to ensure all Matildas players would be available for the competition\u2019s scheduled conclusion.</p> <p>While its neat finish has meant the W-League has been largely out of sight as Australian clubs and administrators have worked to see out the A-League season, the flexibility shown by football\u2019s decision-makers in the women\u2019s space could prove invaluable in the months ahead.</p> <p>Around the world, in a wearyingly predictable fashion, many women\u2019s clubs and leagues have been significantly warped or sacrificed altogether as their men\u2019s equivalents have steamed towards a restart. Leagues in France, Spain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/fa-criticised-binning-womens-super-league-alison-mcgovern\">and England</a> have all been cancelled (with Italy likely to follow), while the NWSL in the United States has <a href=\"https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/article/nwsl-announces-2020-challenge-cup-presented-by-pg-and-secret\">morphed into the Challenge Cup</a>: a 25-game World Cup-style knockout tournament that will run for just one month.</p> <p>The question hanging over many of these leagues now is: what happens next? For Europe\u2019s \u201cbig five\u201d \u2013 France, Spain, England, Italy, and Germany \u2013 kick-off for the 2020-21 season is slowly approaching. All five leagues usually begin their seasons in August or September and conclude in May the following year, while the NWSL is traditionally held between April and October. But there is no knowing whether the leagues are still working toward these original dates, just as there\u2019s no knowing whether a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe and the US could cause further (and possibly fatal) disruptions to them.</p> <p>For international players caught up in league and contract insecurity, then, the W-League is becoming a rather enticing proposition. Still far enough in the future that international travel restrictions could be lifted, in a country that is tracking well in terms of new Covid-19 cases (meaning its four-month season could be played out unhindered \u2013 perhaps even with crowds), and with the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics just a few months after its conclusion, the W-League is perfectly placed to capitalise on the global uncertainty currently facing the domestic women\u2019s game.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time Australian women\u2019s football has had to be logistically nimble. Just as the W-League adjusted its calendar in 2014 to account for Australia hosting the 2015 men\u2019s Asian Cup, the competition could shift slightly to reduce the gap between its conclusion and the start of the Olympics, meaning players wouldn\u2019t risk losing match fitness between the two competitions.</p> <p>In addition, extending the W-League to a full home-and-away season while also adding an extra club \u2013 two suggestions that are part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/wide-reaching-plans-for-independent-w-league-revealed\">the league\u2019s long-term vision</a> \u2013 would provide more game-time for Olympic-bound Matildas as well as more opportunities for international players to prepare themselves for the second-biggest women\u2019s football tournament on the planet.</p> <p>A temporary expansion of international visa spots could be another way of enticing foreign players desperate for game-time ahead of Tokyo, while more flexible player loan agreements between Australian and international clubs could ensure that international players contracted to clubs in less stable leagues could continue to play football in a competitive, professional environment while their parent leagues get themselves in order.</p> <p>And as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/21/australia-and-nzs-womens-world-cup-bid-highlights-a-global-shift\">2023 Women\u2019s World Cup decision looms</a>, such domestic moves could be perfectly timed to ride the wave of enthusiasm generated if Australia\u2019s joint bid with New Zealand proves successful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/29/wolfsburg-cologne-frauen-bundesliga-freiburg-leverkusen\">Wolfsburg thrash Cologne as Frauen Bundesliga bucks trend with restart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFFA\u2019s intent remains for the W-League 2020-21 season to return in and around its usual season window,\u201d an FFA spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, the season window is always assessed and reviewed annually to ensure we can optimise the W-League for players, fans and partners.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our competition design planning and finalisation timelines for the 2020-21 season and we are not in a position to confirm any further details at the moment. However, we absolutely remain committed to continuing to professionalise, grow and showcase the women\u2019s game in Australia and the W-League remains a key element in that commitment.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>If the W-League can show the same adaptability as it did earlier this year by pouncing upon the current uncertainty facing the domestic game elsewhere, it could set Australian women\u2019s football on a new and potentially more prosperous course.</p>",

But he has also sought to exploit the unrest to portray himself as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/has-trump-declared-war-on-the-us-to-save-his-own-skin\">law and order</a>\u201d president; used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/trump-secret-service-george-floyd-protesters-white-house\">divisive and racially loaded language</a>; threatened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/trump-military-retired-general-john-allen-protest\">call in combat troops</a>; urged governors to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">dominate</a>\u201d demonstrators; and ordered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/aclu-lawsuit-trump-protesters-church-white-house\">an assault on peaceful protesters</a> near the White House in order to stage a photo op holding a Bible.</p> \n<p>At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters: \u201cHopefully George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country.\u2019 This is a great day for him. It\u2019s a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This a great, great day in terms of equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>From Dover, Delaware, Biden responded: \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s last words, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe\u2019, have echoed all across this nation and quite frankly around the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, I frankly think is despicable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also has a long history of racial and divisive rhetoric aimed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/trump-black-vote-detroit-speech-obama\">African Americans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/27/muslim-ban-ruling-trumps-bigotry\">Muslims</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-mexico-caravan-voter-claims-speech-west-virginia\">Mexicans</a> and more.

  "<p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national detained by Iran since 2016, has been told her furlough from prison will be extended beyond the previous cut-off date of early June, according to her lawyer. But she has not been informed she will be granted a full clemency, which would allow her to return to the UK.</p> <p>Her family said they were investigating the reports. They previously said they expected to hear on Saturday whether she was to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/30/revolutionary-guards-block-clemency-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">given clemency</a>. Her lawyer, Mahmoud Behzadi-Rad, was reported by Iran International TV on Friday as saying only her furlough had been extended.</p> <p>Richard Ratcliffe, her husband, had said previous commitments on clemencies made by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, meant she qualified for full release.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe has served four years of a five-year sentence, and was released on furlough in March as the coronavirus outbreak entered Iran\u2019s prisons. She has been forced to stay at her parents\u2019 home in Tehran, and to wear a tag.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of prisoners were temporarily released, including half of what Iran described as security prisoners, in March.</p> <p>After appearing to have brought the coronavirus under control in late April and early May, the Iranian government discovered the disease was starting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/iran-faces-crisis-amid-record-number-of-daily-coronavirus-infections\">rip through the country</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/iran-faces-crisis-amid-record-number-of-daily-coronavirus-infections\"> again</a>.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s family has had to endure a wait to hear whether she would be allowed to return to the UK to see her daughter, Gabriella, or would instead be forced to return to Evin prison in Tehran. The family senses Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate is a contest between the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the ministry of foreign affairs, which would be content to see her granted clemency.</p> <p>If she is forced to stay indefinitely in Tehran, the family is certain to contrast her fate to the US prisoner Michael White, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/michael-white-us-navy-veteran-freed-iran\">released</a> this week after nearly a year of negotiations.</p> <p>The release occurred even though Iran is locked in a bitter conflict over the US pull-out from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-nuclear-deal\">2015 nuclear deal</a>, and Donald Trump\u2019s subsequent imposition of sweeping economic sanctions, which have crippled the Iranian economy and made the regime\u2019s fight against the coronavirus harder.</p> <p>The US, as part of an apparent prisoner swap, allowed Majid Taheri, an Iranian scientist imprisoned in the US for 16 months, to be released. He had been accused of violating US sanctions on Iran. A second Iranian scientist, Sirous Asgari, who had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/iran-scientist-us-detention-coronavirus-sirous-asgari\">held by US</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/iran-scientist-us-detention-coronavirus-sirous-asgari\"> immigration authorities</a> for months, was also allowed to return to Iran.</p> <p>Trump tweeted: \u201cThank you to Iran. It shows a deal is possible!\u201d He added that it was in Iran\u2019s interests to reach an agreement on a new nuclear deal before the US presidential election. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted: \u201cThis can happen for all prisoners.

  "<h2>Megan Nolan</h2> <p>When I was forced out of my cheerfully ignorant denial about Covid-19 \u2013 the day I had to abandon a long anticipated three month stay in New York and fly back to Ireland \u2013 I still didn\u2019t believe any of it. Even when my brother picked me up from the airport and drove me to my hometown, both of us in gloves and masks and I experienced for the first time that people who loved each other really were no longer touching, the unnatural stiffness of it all \u2013 even then I didn\u2019t buy it. I knew logically it was happening, of course, and harboured no conspiracy theories, but still I could not credit it. \u201cIt can\u2019t be real,\u201d I thought to myself quite calmly, \u201cBecause there is no way I could bear it.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>It seemed impossible that I should be sequestered without a partner or friends for an indefinite period. At the best of times, my great, characteristic, weakness is a compulsive need for company. I find it impossible to stay in more than a night or two a week. I do not enjoy my own company. Why would I? My work involves dissecting and categorising and exploring my thoughts and feelings, so that by the time it\u2019s 6pm I am utterly sick of what I have to say. I want only to hear my friends talk endlessly at me, relieving me of the need to hear myself, feel myself.&nbsp;</p> <p>In New York, I was recently single and filled with the giddy potential of a new city and a new phase of my life. I went out every night and dated with abandon. Towards the end, when I was getting the impression that living this way would soon be impossible, I started making a log of these funny or sweet or sexy or embarrassing encounters. The night before I flew home, knowing it would be the last for an unknowable length of time, I kissed my date on his doorstep over and over, not wanting to leave and have my life as a flighty, promiscuous person officially end.&nbsp;</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the past five years without much by way of stability, mostly on purpose, sometimes not. Work and money have been precarious, London housing situations sporadic and short-lived. I was often doing stints abroad, house sitting, or looking after cats, or taking advantage of a cheap sublet somewhere or other. You pay a price for rejecting stability \u2013 I was often exhausted from having no real base, my belongings are in five different households in three countries \u2013 but you get many good things in return too. Chiefly it was the feeling of authoring my own life, the immense privilege of doing more or less what I wanted to be doing at all times and not having any significant responsibilities beyond keeping myself alive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I drink until I\u2019m drunk and I talk to people. I find myself having long phone conversations with fairly arbitrary people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic means that I am now suffering the absence of all the bonds I refused and enjoying none of the rewards that mitigated the particular kind of loneliness I chose.&nbsp;Back in Ireland, I am drinking too much. Every second or third night I sit at the desk in the front room my mother kindly gave over to me as a makeshift office, and I drink until I\u2019m drunk and I talk to people. In an attempt to imitate the haphazard, incontinent socialising of my normal life, I find myself having hour-long phone conversations with fairly arbitrary people I barely knew before all this, as well as my closest friends and my beloved ex partner. It\u2019s sort of awful but sort of heartening too, the amount we need to connect with each other, so that we\u2019ll do it with semi-strangers in these absurd circumstances even when it\u2019s uncomfortable and agonising in its own way.&nbsp;</p> <p>I drink Cava and grapefruit juice and I drink Rioja that costs 30 quid because what else am I spending money on right now, and when it\u2019s late and I should be asleep I drink vodka and lime juice with tap water and ice. I drink whatever\u2019s around, because I know I\u2019ll want the hangover almost as much as I want to be drunk. The hangover days make&nbsp;the perennial feeling of inert sluggishness feel almost good, make the formless hours justified in their bland repetition.&nbsp;</p> <p>I\u2019ll return to London next week, it being as close a thing to home as I have, in time to turn 30. When I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/writing-shameful-feminine-karl-ove-knausgard-my-struggle-writing\">sold my book last year</a> it was the first time in my life I gained any sort of financial security. I am feeling profoundly grateful that I can now afford to live alone. I\u2019ve bought the first television I\u2019ll have had since I left home at 18, soft furnishings, good crockery. I invest in it all gladly, thinking this flat is where I\u2019ll necessarily be for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m adapting, in other words. But I can\u2019t help but remember the good reasons I rejected domesticity until now, resisted objects, pets, permanence. I\u2019m so lucky to have what I have, but I won\u2019t stop waiting for the day I can give it all away, when I can pack up the TV and the good casserole dish and the reading lamp and go off and be both as totally social and as totally lonely as I wish to be again.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Acts of Desperation</em> <em>will be published by Jonathan Cape in 2021.</em></p> <h2><br>Margaret Drabble</h2> <p>In lockdown, time stands still while simultaneously moving at astonishing speed. My husband, Michael, and I are self-isolating in Somerset. I am impressed by how quickly predictive texting caught on to the new language of coronavirus. It certainly knows how to spell \u201cself-isolating\u201d, a concept that didn\u2019t exist a few months ago.</p> <p>I am utterly gripped by the news and cannot get enough of it. The unrolling of this great tragedy, which has as yet no end or ending in sight, is a spectacle like no other. At my age, I don\u2019t really care much what happens to me, so I feel in a sense fortunate to have been able to witness this extraordinary drama. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to have missed it. The politics and the science, national and international, are compelling. I seize eagerly on each new bit of information about the vaccine and symptoms and bad or good crowd behaviour. It\u2019s amazing to be in the midst of a situation that nobody, but nobody, understands, with outcomes that nobody can predict. </p> <p>We have all had to learn new tricks. Michael displayed great skill with the wood burner in the cold early weeks, and somehow managed to take a photo of a gash on top of my head to send to the surgery. Some local firms have shown much enterprise \u2013 my garage was very imaginative about my need for an MOT. We don\u2019t venture out to the village grocery, which prefers to deliver, though we did travel a few miles to buy some asparagus from the farm. </p> <p>Our cultural life is fine. We have plenty of books and at teatime I read aloud to Michael, whose eyesight is not good. We have read together forthcoming books by our friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/carmen-callil\">Carmen Callil</a>, Nell Dunn, and Mich\u00e8le Roberts, which provide company. I can\u2019t be bothered to watch films or television dramas, they all seem so silly and unreal, and escapism of that sort is not what I want at this moment in history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve had my life, and one compensation of old age is a sense of detachment and an absence of fear. I\u2019m just a spectator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If I were younger, I would of course worry about the financial situation and the gigantic crash yet to come, but I\u2019ve had my life, and one of the few compensations of old age is, for me, a sense of detachment and an absence of fear. I\u2019m just a spectator. I\u2019d like to see how it sorts itself, but the ongoing day-to-day drama is keeping me going right now. I\u2019m not responsible for it. It\u2019s a pandemic panorama, the movie to end all movies.</p> <p>We listen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-3\">Radio 3</a>, which I appreciate now more than ever. I am musically ignorant but I like listening to whatever comes along, and enjoy the friendly and easy discourse of the presenters. Dipping in to WH Auden, looking for his sinister plague poem, \u201cGare du Midi\u201d, I found \u201cThe Composer\u201d, a wonderfully generous poem about classical music, which was one of my daughter\u2019s favourites:</p> <p><em>You alone, alone, imaginary song,<br>Are unable to say an existence is wrong,<br>And pour out your forgiveness like a wine.</em></p> <p>Wordsworth too has been, as ever, a great resource. I recite him silently, endlessly, as we go on our Wordsworthian daily walk past neighbours repairing their dry-stone walls and shepherds shepherding their lambs. I hear a thousand blended notes, I hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.</p> <p>I hear from friends in London, in their 80s and over, who go out to shop in the supermarket, though one has been immured in her flat by government decree and is receiving food parcels, and another was alarmed by being jostled off the pavement. We all choose our own degrees of risk, though we stay within the regulations, unlike Dominic Cummings. One of us is longing for a haircut, but I don\u2019t mind if I never have mine cut again.</p> <p>Of course I miss seeing friends and family, but most have been keeping in touch with me by one means or another. I\u2019ve always spent a lot of time alone, I\u2019m used to it. Many old folk I know are constantly having Zoom book groups and cocktail parties, but I don\u2019t really like the technology. We had a couple of Zoom family events but the truth is that they left me feeling sad and lonely. It was lovely to see their faces and their homes, but the worry about pressing the wrong button and the inevitable visual distortions were upsetting, and made me feel further away than ever. I know that if I were young I would get to grips with it all, but at my age it hardly seems worth the effort.</p> <p>I do listen anxiously for any news about changing guidance for the over-80s, which is sometimes hard to find and sometimes confusing, and I agree with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/older-people-could-face-extended-coronavirus-lockdown-lords-hears\">David Blunkett, </a>the former home secretary,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/older-people-could-face-extended-coronavirus-lockdown-lords-hears\"> </a>that we shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against as a category. We should be allowed to take our own risks, provided we don\u2019t endanger others. But for now, it\u2019s a waiting game, and there\u2019s a lot of play to watch. All in all, I consider myself lucky.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Pattern in the Carpet: A Personal History </em><em>With Jigsaws by Margaret Drabble</em> <em>is reissued in paperback by Canongate.</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Revolutionary Guards pull a family off the road to check for forbidden items in their silver Buick; they find neither alcohol nor music but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/may/09/gabriel-garcia-marquez-presents-magic-realism-one-hundred-years-of-solitude\">Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/may/09/gabriel-garcia-marquez-presents-magic-realism-one-hundred-years-of-solitude\">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a></em>. After passing the copy around, they conclude that \u201cpolitically, it was not a dangerous book\u201d. The censors have been less forgiving of Shokoofeh Azar\u2019s first novel for adults, which was banned in Iran, though many copies have been printed underground. It is now on the shortlist for the 2020 International Booker prize \u2013 a first for fiction translated from Farsi.</p> <p>As signalled by the nod to Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the novel applies magic realism with a Persian twist to Iran after the Islamic revolution of 1979, focusing on one family destroyed by the upheaval. It opens in 1988 as a mother\u2019s grief-driven epiphany at the top of a \u201cgreengage plum tree\u201d coincides with the execution of her son, hanged without trial and dumped in a mass grave in the deserts south of Tehran \u2013 \u201cone of fifteen thousand people \u2026 killed for their political beliefs in the 1980s, alone\u201d. </p> <p>The youth\u2019s 13-year-old sister Bahar had burned to death in a cellar when zealots stormed the family home in Tehran \u2013 a mansion filled with Persian poetry, tar music and an \u201cuncensored\u201d library, from Rumi and Shakespeare to Sadegh Hedayat\u2019s modern classic <em>The Blind Owl</em>. It is ostensibly the dead girl\u2019s ghost who narrates how her bereaved parents, Reza and Hushang, her sister Beeta and brother Sohrab, sought \u201csanctuary and serenity\u201d in the ancient forests of Mazandaran in northern Iran. As four guards and a mullah pursue them, Sohrab is removed in handcuffs, Reza abandons their forest home, and Beeta, grappling with delusions, morphs into a mermaid in the Caspian sea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Azar deploys dreams and Persian folklore, from forest jinns to black snow, to mythologise a civilisation devouring itself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Footnotes proliferate: Azar deploys dreams and an encyclopaedic knowledge of Persian folklore, from forest jinns to black snow, to mythologise a revolution\u2019s decay and a civilisation devouring itself. The \u201cinsatiable\u201d eight-year Iran-Iraq war, stoked \u201cwith the flesh of child mine-sweepers\u201d, is poignantly evoked through \u201corphan mothers\u201d who bury their sons with the small golden bells that are tied around children\u2019s ankles \u201cso they wouldn\u2019t get lost\u201d. In a supernatural revenge fantasy, these ranks of cannon fodder join forces with the disappeared to vanquish the \u201cstonily arrogant\u201d Ayatollah Khomeini in his subterranean palace of mirrors, his corpse emitting the \u201csame stench that all dictators secrete in the end\u201d.</p> <p>Some playful prose, as when Reza and a blue-eyed Italian backpacker find themselves \u201chigh upon the enlightenment of love\u201d, suggests a Farsi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/isabelallende\">Isabel Allende</a>. But the main problem is an ill-conceived, and poorly controlled, teenage narrative (\u201cI was nothing but a delusional dead person\u201d) more reminiscent of magic realism\u2019s New Age spinoff \u2013 a cloying genre that went global in the 1990s with novels such as Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni\u2019s <em>The Mistress of Spices</em>. The plot itself suffers from blind alleys (an irrelevant treasure trunk); a premature climax (Khomeini\u2019s early nemesis); and a limp ending.</p> <p>The author, who sought political asylum in Australia in 2011, has said she wrote the novel primarily for western readers. But, despite a catalogue of appalling events, we learn surprisingly little of the history behind the revolution. The shah\u2019s Literacy Corps is mentioned, but not his secret police. In place of the historical forces at work in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s fiction, we have national myth. Bahar\u2019s immolation is likened to the Arab conquest of Persia, when Islam ousted Zoroastrianism around the seventh century. The family persist in referring to this modern orgy of book burning and killing as \u201cthe Arab invasion\u201d: \u201cThey came and burnt, plundered, and killed. Just like 1,400 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The US-based translator, whose name the UK publishers have withheld \u201cfor reasons of safety and at the translator\u2019s request\u201d, has made a good job of sections. But, too often, it reads like a draft, tripping up the reader. Consider this description of a treehouse: \u201cIt had a window facing the sunrise and a door facing its setting\u201d \u2013 the sun\u2019s setting, that is. Or this: \u201cLife is precisely that which she and others were prodigiously killing \u2013 the moment itself.\u201d</p> <p>In the most convincing section, set decades after the revolution, the bereaved father passes morality police and chador-clad women in Tehran, feeling \u201calien in his own country\u201d. Detained, he writes a record of his life, investing desperate hope in the power of the imagination to transport him from the \u201cstale minds\u201d of his captors. Few would quarrel with such a sentiment. Yet to overlook the book\u2019s flaws risks what South African writers under apartheid, eager for a robust critical response to their art, memorably scorned as \u201csolidarity criticism\u201d. It would also be regrettable if the claims made for this ambitious but uneven novel deterred even a few readers from venturing further into Farsi literature.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree by Shokoofeh Azar, translated by Anonymous, is published by Europa Editions (RRP \u00a313.99).

  "<p>Restaurants are opening, parks are full and people are getting back to work: parts of Europe, Asia and much of the Middle East are enjoying the benefits of flattened coronavirus curves. Meanwhile, parts of the US, India and Latin America are still recording thousands of new cases every day.</p> <p>The first wave of the coronavirus is not over. The future shape of the pandemic will be decided both by human action, in the form of social distancing, testing and other traditional methods of disease control, but also several unanswered questions about the nature of the virus itself.</p> <p>Experts say there are several possibilities.</p> <h2>Peaks and troughs</h2> <p>One is that the virus breaks out and is suppressed in peaks and troughs, until enough of the population is vaccinated or potentially develops immunity.</p> <p>Antibody tests in most places indicate that quarantine measures were very effective in slowing down the virus. Fewer than 10% of populations in France, Spain and Sweden have developed the antibodies that would be evidence of having caught the virus and, in theory, becoming immune, for at least a short time.</p> <p>But that also means the vast majority of populations remain susceptible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave1-zip/giv-3902ZCOyz8dvkb0T\" data-alt=\"Peaks and troughs\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave1-zip/giv-3902ZCOyz8dvkb0T\">Peaks and troughs</a> </figure>  <p>If societies reopen before the virus is sufficiently eradicated, it may be that this first wave does not completely go away, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.</p> <p>\u201cIn the US, we are lifting lockdowns when there are still increasing numbers of cases in a bunch of states \u2026 We may just have peaks and valleys of transmission occurring over and over again as people\u2019s behaviour changes,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The scale of these peaks could be reduced by making changes such as wearing masks, using public transport in a staggered way and avoiding overcrowded social events \u2013 which are increasingly being blamed for being \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d of the first wave of the coronavirus.</p> <p>If outbreaks grow too large, some governments might choose to reimplement quarantines. \u201cIf we\u2019re reopening and we start to see case numbers growing rapidly in a few weeks, we may see rolling lockdowns or shutdowns to try to control the virus in those areas,\u201d Rasmussen says.</p> <h2>Future waves</h2> <p>Most influenza pandemics have historically struck in distinct wave patterns, with a first peak usually <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/cidrap-covid19-viewpoint-part1_0.pdf\">followed by a resurgent second wave</a> six months later. But there is no guarantee Sars-CoV-2 will play out in the same way.</p> <p>Social distancing and robust testing \u2013 or a lack of it \u2013 will be critical in deciding the future of the pandemic. But its shape will also be influenced by factors outside our control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave2-zip/giv-3902fWNMHWJrifc2\" data-alt=\"Future waves\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave2-zip/giv-3902fWNMHWJrifc2\">Future waves</a> </figure>  <p>The first is whether we can become immune to the virus, and if so, how long that protection endures for.</p> <p>Sometimes immunity can last for decades. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, public health authorities were initially confused as to why many older people seemed to be immune. Later, they discovered the virus was structurally similar to one that circulated during the 1918 pandemic. The immune systems of many older people had dealt with a similar virus 92 years ago.</p> <p>Resistance to some earlier discovered coronaviruses has been thought to fade within a year. If immunity to Sars-CoV-2 is not permanent, a report from Harvard epidemiologists says it is likely to <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6493/860\">enter into regular circulation</a>, coming in annual or biennial waves or sporadic outbursts.</p> <p>The frequency of significant outbreaks may also be influenced by the weather. Most influenzas spread more easily in the winter because the virus is thought to prefer dry air over humidity, and because people in cold environments spend more time indoors and close to each other.</p> <p>Existing coronaviruses also follow seasonal patterns. If this coronavirus behaves in the same way \u2013 and there is not yet strong evidence that it does \u2013 we could see regular wintertime surges of Covid-19.</p> <p>But with so many people still apparently not immune to the virus, that summer relief may not arrive this year, says James Hay, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health.</p> <p>\u201cThe factor that most contributes towards transmission is how many people are still susceptible,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd with so many still susceptible, that\u2019s going to swamp out any climate effect.\u201d</p> <p>Significant mutations in the virus might also lead to a wave of new infections down the track. So far, scientists say that isn\u2019t a huge concern. </p> <p>\u201cEven though there are different genomes out there that have changes compared to each other \u2026 there\u2019s no evidence any of those changes are in spots that are critical for the immune system to recognise,\u201d Rasmussen says.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see a significant mutation later. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known about this for six months, so it\u2019s possible different strains could emerge in the future, because it does have a higher mutation rate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut right now there\u2019s no evidence that that\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <h2>Infections are kept under control</h2> <p>For countries that are able to implement highly effective interventions such as testing and contact tracing, this first wave of coronavirus cases may be the last they experience, at least for some time.</p> <p>In New Zealand, which has managed to virtually eradicate the virus and installed robust systems to monitor new outbreaks, there may be no significant new outbreaks or future waves at all, says Nick Wilson, a professor of public health at the University of Otago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave3-zip/giv-39024N7DuaXHi0NR\" data-alt=\"Infections under control\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave3-zip/giv-39024N7DuaXHi0NR\">Infections under control</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cNew Zealand is about to eliminate this virus,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cEven if there are border control failures, I expect that the contact tracing system is now good enough to control an occasional outbreak. So this country should be able to avoid future waves until a vaccine arrives.\u201d</p> <p>Countries with small populations and isolated geography such as New Zealand and Australia may be able to pull this off. South Korea is another country whose virus detection and suppression systems may be advanced enough to smother any future outbreaks. But it will be extremely difficult for most countries, especially those with large populations and porous borders.</p> <h2>The virus peters out</h2> <p>There are a minority of epidemiologists who argue the deadliness of the coronavirus has been overstated. One of the most prominent is Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University, who says the virus could already be on the way out.</p> <p>She argues that the antibody studies conducted so far have been unreliable, and do not take into account the possibility that many people might already be immune to Covid-19 because of exposure to more benign coronaviruses. </p> <p>Others, including neuroscientist Karl Friston, have also spoken of some populations such as Germany\u2019s having some kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/covid-19-expert-karl-friston-germany-may-have-more-immunological-dark-matter\">immunological \u201cdark matter\u201d</a> that has kept fatalities there low compared to Spain, Italy or the UK.</p> <p>This view is an outlier, and most governments have preferred to plan for the worst-case scenario \u2013 that millions of people are vulnerable to the virus. But Gupta argues the fact that virus transmission rates have peaked and fallen even in some places that did not institute harsh lockdowns is evidence for her theory.</p> <p>\u201cIn almost every context we\u2019ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away \u2013 almost like clockwork,\u201d Gupta told <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/05/oxford-doubles-down-sunetra-gupta-interview/\">the media outlet</a> UnHerd last week.</p> <p>\u201cTo me that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the buildup of immunity,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s a more parsimonious explanation than one which requires in every country for lockdown, or various degrees of lockdown, including no lockdown, to have had the same effect.\u201d</p>",

Will we be getting a Friday surprise today as well?</p> \n  <p>Earlier, at the press conference, <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>was asked about free childcare, which the education minister, <strong>Dan Tehan</strong>, has signalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/its-done-its-job-dan-tehan-flags-end-of-free-childcare-under-weight-of-increasing-demand\">must come to an end as the economy reopens and more children return to care</a>.</p> \n  <p>Morrison said that centres \u201care keen to move back to a more normal arrangement\u201d and \u201cwe will be in a position in the not too distant future to make further announcements about that\u201d. So far \u2013 a pretty good candidate for the Friday surprise.</p> \n  <p>Then we spotted a <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00066\">legislative instrument</a>, registered on Friday, in which the education department secretary <strong>nominated 13 July as the date at which new rules on allowable absences from childcare will apply</strong>. The rules were due to apply from 21 September or a date to be fixed by the secretary.</p> \n  <p>Allowable absences are an integral part of the old subsidy model \u2013 they define reasons children can be absent that won\u2019t result in reduced subsidies to parents. They\u2019re less relevant under the temporary free system, as the government stopped caring about the whys and wherefores of children not attending care.</p> \n  <p>We can\u2019t be sure the 13 July date is when the free system will snap back to something resembling the old subsidy model. But it\u2019s a pretty big bread crumb in the trail.

But <strong>George Floyd</strong>\u2019s death has raised questions about whether Arradondo \u2014 or any chief \u2014 can fix the department. The city\u2019s own data going back to 2015 shows that when police officers use force, 60% of the time the person they\u2019re dealing with is black, though only 20% of the population is black.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the chief\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d <strong>City Council member Steve Fletcher</strong> said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this department was ever going to let him get there. I think people understand he was in an impossible situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Fletcher argues that Arradondo was too lenient with discipline in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made getting rid of problem officers difficult later.</p> \n  <p>Arradondo\u2019s predecessor, <strong>Janee Harteau</strong>, was forced out over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">the fatal shooting of <strong>Justine Ruszczyk Damond</strong></a>. She said she received push-back from the union when she was trying to implement reforms and this week she called on police union President Lt. <strong>Bob Kroll</strong> to resign after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">his controversial comments</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges related to Floyd\u2019s death and will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department to determine if it has engaged in discriminatory practices, <strong>Governor Tim Walz</strong> said this week.</p> \n  <p>Fletcher said he wants to examine whether the police department should be disbanded, saying he believes it\u2019s \u201cso broken it can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to rebuild from the ground up,\u201d said Fletcher, vice chair of the city\u2019s public safety committee. <br></p> \n  <p>Bob Bennett, an attorney who said he has sued the department \u201chundreds\u201d of times over police misconduct allegations, said Arradondo probably did the best he could, but the union has more sway than chiefs do over police conduct.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI know he wants to reform the department as much as anyone I\u2019ve ever met or seen,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHopefully this whole mess will bring about some change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9e4e68f0854eb54d99384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T06:35:07.864Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far\u2026</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.

Bail would be lowered to $750,000 if they agreed to certain conditions, including forfeiting any personal firearms</p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death, which happened on Memorial Day, 25 May. Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also compared Trump\u2019s behaviour to Nazi propaganda and called the president\u2019s stunt on Monday, ordering the gassing of peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op outside St John\u2019s church, an \u201c<strong>abuse of executive authority</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268347256748507136\">tweeted</a> back: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost as inevitable as the abuse was the fact that the tweet contained a lie.

He did not ask for his resignation. <strong>The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused</strong>. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then he got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Unlike Mattis, Kelly has spoken out about Trump before, backing impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and expressing quite wide disagreement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/ex-white-house-chief-staff-john-kelly-speaks-out-against-trump\">Asked in February</a> why he went to work for Trump in 2017, Kelly said he had been \u201cfascinated \u2013 not necessarily in a good way \u2013 but fascinated as to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">that election</a> meant to our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Kelly and Mattis have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/john-kelly-donald-trump-cliff-sims-book\">widely reported</a> to have been \u201cadults in the room\u201d in the first years of the Trump White House, willing to stand up to the president and obstruct his more dangerous impulses.

  "<p>As the coronavirus lockdown continues, the Guardian\u2019s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction \u2013 something to send you down memory lane, or to divert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us. We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.</p> <h2>The rules</h2> <p>We\u2019ll be counting this down over six weeks \u2013 for the first two weeks, we\u2019ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.</p> <p>This list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s<strong> </strong>the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.</p> <p>As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p><em>Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor</em></p> <h2><strong>100</strong></h2> <h2>Bill Haley and His Comets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eJOJhwgluE\">Rock Around the Clock</a> (1955)</h2> <p>You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll record. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/15/observer-archive-rock-around-the-clock-16-september-1956\">Rock Around the Clock</a> patently isn\u2019t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. <strong>AP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e3d2d025c017f4ca07dac5371a7783905e20286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3d2d025c017f4ca07dac5371a7783905e20286/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand singer Lorde, AKA Ella Yelich-O\u2019Connor, in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Generational bellwether \u2026 New Zealand singer Lorde, AKA Ella Yelich-O\u2019Connor, in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Will/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>99</strong></h2> <h2>Lorde \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFasFq4GJYM\">Royals</a> (2013)</h2> <p>By disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop\u2019s reigning class, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/10/lorde-just-freak-royals-pure-heroine\">Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one</a>: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations.

Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career.

It was written by Trent with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/petula-clark-tony-hatch-how-we-made-downtown\">Tony Hatch</a>, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach\u2019s knack for orchestral drama.

Everything the Beatles had promised through the first half of the year found its focus in their fourth single, an explosion of exuberance that forced the world, not just their teenage fans, to acknowledge their existence. She Loves You presented an integrated whole, a sound of collective creativity that demolished the supremacy of solo artists, setting a trend that would dominate pop music for a generation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/03/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-3-the-beatles-she-loves-you\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Richard Williams</strong></p> <h2><strong>2</strong></h2> <h2>The Specials \u2013&nbsp;Ghost Town (1981)</h2> <p>It was the Specials\u2019 biggest hit and one of the biggest-selling singles of 1981.

  "<p>In late 2018 two far-right figures meet in a Rome hotel. The first is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2016/dec/19/trump-putin-same-side-new-world-order\">Alexander Dugin</a>, a Russian philosopher. With his long wispy beard, Dugin looks as if he might have fallen from the pages of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\">Crime and Punishment</a></em>. The second is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/steve-bannon-working-class-republicans-labour\">Steve Bannon</a>, former adviser to Donald Trump and an unashamed nationalist.</p> <p>The pair speak for eight hours. On the face of it they have much in common. Both are leading exponents of radical anti-liberal thinking who serve powerful masters. The list of mutual dislikes is long: globalism, international institutions, universal human rights. Neither is exactly a fan of immigration. Their vision is a world of sovereign and culturally specific nation states. It has a religious element, too, with lots of talk about the \u201cJudeo-Christian west\u201d. Bannon has repeatedly mooted an alliance between the US and Russia, seeing both states as natural partners in the struggle against godless cosmopolitanism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s never entirely clear if Teitelbaum shares his subjects\u2019 extreme views or regards them as ethnographic curiosities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to the US scholar Benjamin Teitelbaum the Russian-American duo share another hidden bond. Both follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_School\">traditionalism</a>, a 20th-century philosophical and spiritual school. It was once obscure, Teitelbaum writes, but it now has an outsize influence on far-right politics, and Dugin and Bannon have avidly studied its texts.</p> <p>Traditionalism\u2019s two leading lights are little known. One is Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, a French convert to Islam who wrote that history moves in cycles. The other is Julius Evola, an Italian baron and fascist. The pair\u2019s ideas form what Teitelbaum describes as \u201cDungeons &amp; Dragons for racists\u201d. Their creed is defiantly anti-modern and anti-Enlightenment. It favours the spiritual, the symbolic and the occult. Traditionalists see destruction as a precursor to a golden age. Oh, and according to Evola, Aryans are descended from ghostly, ethereal beings who lived in the Arctic.</p> <p>This all sounds crackpot, until you contemplate Trump\u2019s tearing down of the US administrative state. Environmental Protection Agency, State Department, Education Department: all were handed over to people who had vowed to wreck them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34ad143c681613f01c219582b400c74e497c0b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34ad143c681613f01c219582b400c74e497c0b17/0_30_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018An outreach person to white nationalists abroad.\u2019 Alexander Dugin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An outreach person to white nationalists abroad\u2019 \u2026 Alexander Dugin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sputnik/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>War for Eternity</em> joins the dots between this newly influential philosophy and leading personalities from the global right. In 2018-9 Teitelbaum spent 20 hours talking to Bannon. He spoke to Dugin and met with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/28/turf-war-breaks-between-bolsonaro-sons-and-brazil-vice-president\">Olavo de Carvalho</a>, a one-time journalist and astrologer who advises Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro.</p> <p>Bannon comes across as an erratic interviewee. Asked how he discovered traditionalism, the great guru replies: \u201cI\u2019m just some fuckin\u2019 guy, making it up as I go along.\u201d Trump\u2019s notorious aide is sometimes bored by philosophical questions, and glances at his phone. The author thinks nonetheless that Bannon\u2019s musings amount to a \u201ccoherent system of thought\u201d.</p> <p>The book is good on Bannon but weak on Dugin and Russian politics. Dugin is the leading proponent of Eurasianism, a doctrine that sees Russia as the centre of a rival empire to the Atlanticist west. Boiled down, his ideas are Russian-flavoured fascism. Dugin \u201cinspired\u201d Vladimir Putin, Teitelbaum says. In reality the Kremlin promoted Dugin because his Moscow-centred pseudo theories sit well with Putin\u2019s own project to remake Russia as a great power. This mission has nothing to do with Evola or Gu\u00e9non. It belongs to the KGB (now called the FSB). </p> <p>Over two decades the Kremlin has experimented with various ideologies as a way of rationalising its imperial ambitions. Putin\u2019s current favoured political vector is the far right. The Russian president\u2019s funding of anti-establishment parties across Europe is part of a strategy to sabotage western democracy. Dugin plays a licensed role in this, as outreach person to white nationalists and other allies abroad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/lockdown-groups-far-right-links-coronavirus-protests-american-revolution\">Revealed: major anti-lockdown group's links to America's far right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At times I found <em>War for Eternity</em> infuriating. Teitelbaum refers to Bannon chummily as \u201cSteve\u201d and seems more than a little starstruck. It\u2019s never entirely clear if Teitelbaum shares his subjects\u2019 extreme views or simply regards them as ethnographic curiosities. There is a dinner with \u201cSteve\u201d and other far-right luminaries. We learn that Bannon tells his visitors to ask for Obi-Wan Kenobi at hotel receptions when coming to see him. </p> <p>Teitelbaum says little about the consequences of having Trump, Bolsonaro and others of their ilk in power. Their contempt for science, reason, facts, institutions and professional experts has been on show for a while now. These prejudices \u2013 dressed up as philosophy \u2013 have never seemed less suited to the moment.

Deaths are approaching 390,000, with the current toll at 389,645. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected under-reporting.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil\u2019s death toll overtakes Italy\u2019s to become third-highest globally</strong></h2> <p>Brazil\u2019s total Covid-19 death toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-brazil-record-daily-death-toll-mexico\">passed that of Italy on Thursday</a>, as the Health Ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the US and the UK.</p> <h2><strong>Ebola drug&nbsp;endorsed as a treatment in Australia</strong></h2> <p>The antiviral drug remdesivir has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/remdesivir-ebola-drug-endorsed-as-a-coronavirus-treatment-in-australia\">recommended for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Australia</a>. The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce said Australian doctors treating adults with moderate, severe or critical Covid-19 should consider using the drug to aid recovery times.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/01/remdesivir-five-australian-hospitals-to-receive-experimental-coronavirus-drug\">The antiviral drug</a> is the first medication to be recommended as a considered treatment for patients in hospital after contracting coronavirus. </p> <h2><strong>South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases</strong></h2> <p>South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure.</p> <h2><strong>New York governor urges protesters to get tested</strong></h2> <p>The thousands of people protesting over the death of George Floyd have a \u201ccivic duty\u201d to be tested for the coronavirus and help New York avoid a spike in new cases as it slowly restarts its economy, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. An estimated 20,000 people have demonstrated in New York City alone, Cuomo said, as he expanded the state\u2019s testing criteria to include people who attended recent protests. </p> <h2><strong>Mexico man dies after face mask arrest</strong></h2> <p>Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/mexican-arrested-for-not-wearing-face-mask-later-found-dead\">for not wearing a face mask in public</a>. Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, was detained on 4 May in the town of Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de Los Membrillos near Guadalajara. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ssbeltran/status/1268514693947297794?s=20\">Video of the incident</a>&nbsp;emerged on Wednesday, and shows officers with assault rifles forcing L\u00f3pez into a truck as bystanders plead for his release. Meanwhile Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported a record 4,442 additional cases on Thursday, and 816 more deaths, bringing the total to 105,680 cases and 12,545 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Covid-19 causing 10,000 dementia deaths in UK</strong></h2> <p>There were almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says\">10,000 unexplained extra deaths among people with dementia</a> in April, according to official figures that have prompted alarm about the severe impact of social isolation on people with the condition. The data, from the&nbsp;Office for National Statistics, reveals that, beyond deaths directly linked to Covid-19, there were 83% more deaths from dementia than usual, with charities warning that a reduction in essential medical care and family visits were taking a devastating toll.</p> <h2><strong>Argentina extends lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Argentina extended a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires and other parts of the country until 28 June, as confirmed cases continued to rise, passing 20,000 earlier in the day. The three-week extension of the lockdown will affect the capital, the province of Buenos Aires and other areas that have the highest concentration of confirmed infections, President Alberto Fernandez said.</p> <h2><strong>Patients with high blood pressure twice as likely to die: study</strong></h2> <p>Patients with high blood pressure admitted to hospital with coronavirus are twice as likely to die as those without the condition, researchers said on Friday. For in-patients with the virus who had stopped taking medication for high blood pressure, the risk of dying doubled again, they reported in the European Heart Journal after reviewing cases in Wuhan.</p> <h2><strong>Long waitfor Tokyo Olympics decision</strong></h2> <p>A Tokyo 2020 executive board member said on Friday that organisers will need to monitor the coronavirus situation until spring next year to decide whether to hold the Summer Olympics, Kyodo News reported.

The Games were postponed from this year because of the pandemic.</p>",

Setting out his visions for a \u201chealthcare army\u201d, he would like to see greater harmonisation of training and practice, to allow professionals to move between countries, including in the event of a future pandemic. As a British citizen he remains \u201cvery sad about Brexit\u201d and hopes future immigration law will not stunt the free movement of healthcare professionals.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In any pandemic, intensive care is only part of a picture. The most important thing is what happens outside hospitals to slow down virus transmission, he said. \u201cStatistically a country that moves together and citizens that move together can make a huge difference. That is why the individual responsibility of citizens is crucial and governments need to guide in a manner that is responsible.\u201d</p>",

Consent was granted by the then minister for Aboriginal affairs in Western Australia in 2013, one year before an archeological survey, approved by Rio, found the site was of high archeological significance and showed signs of human occupation dating back 46,000 years, including throughout the last ice age.
