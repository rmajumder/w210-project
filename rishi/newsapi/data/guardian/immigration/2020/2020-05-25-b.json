  "<p>Mexico City issued 8,072 more death certificates than usual between 1 January and 20 May, according to a new study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400.</p> <p>Research <a href=\"https://datos.nexos.com.mx/?p=1388\">published</a> in the Mexican magazine Nexos on Monday used information from the capital\u2019s 52 civil registries to estimate the number of death certificates created in the period up to 20 May.</p> <p>The report\u2019s authors, investigators Mario Romero Zavala and Laurianne Despeghel, found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than the average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number would mushroom by 120%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/22/planes-spray-the-city-at-night-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-in-mexicos-motor-town\">'Planes spray the city at night': Covid-19 conspiracy theories in Mexico's motor town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors said not all those excess deaths were caused by Covid-19, but some of those who died \u201cdidn\u2019t go to hospitals for fear of catching it\u201d and died of other causes.</p> <p>Romero and Despeghel put the percentage of excess deaths officially attributed to Covid-19 in Mexico City at 25% \u2013 lower than the rates of 97% in Germany and 54% in the UK.</p> <p>As of Monday, Mexico City had recorded 1,963 Covid-19 deaths, according to its mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum. That is the highest tally of any Mexican state, but a figure that is coming under increasing scrutiny since the country\u2019s rate of testing remains low.</p> <p>Mexico has now officially recorded 7,394 deaths and 68,620 Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>The investigation into Mexico City\u2019s death certificates added to growing questions about the official Covid-19 death count in both Mexico and its capital. Sheinbaum and federal health officials deny any deliberate miscounting of the official figures.</p> <p>Mexico <a href=\"https://www.as-coa.org/articles/chart-covid-19-testing-recovery-and-mortality-rates-latin-america\">ranks</a> near the bottom in testing among Latin American countries with just 99 tests per 100,000 residents as of 15 May.</p> <p>Romero, the report author, told the Guardian: \u201cGiven the low number of deaths reported in Mexico, one would assume that we are undercounting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConfirmed cases are highly correlated with testing. Given that correlation, if a country takes a strategy where they do very little testing, it\u2019s safe to assume confirmed deaths will also be undercounted,\u201d Romero added.</p> <p>Coronavirus tsar Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell previously predicted Mexico would hit its peak number of Covid-19 cases during the first 10 days of May and estimated <a href=\"https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/lopez-gatell-estima-que-el-coronavirus-dejara-cerca-de-6-mil-muertos-en-mexico\">the death toll</a> would peak at about 6,000.</p> <p>The country recorded 479 deaths on Friday \u2013 its highest daily total yet \u2013 although both L\u00f3pez-Gatell and President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador claim the Covid-19 curve has \u201cflattened\u201d.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has claimed to have \u201ctamed\u201d the coronavirus, is pushing ahead with plans to open the country in stages, despite the rising death toll.</p>",

But his own judgment was questioned by some.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/uk-coronavirus-live-boirs-johnson-dominic-cummings-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ecbe8e88f08a1782fa813e6#block-5ecbe8e88f08a1782fa813e6\">Cummings insisted he did not regret his actions.</a></strong> While he said he understood people\u2019s anger, he refused to apologise and said he did not regret what he had done.</li> \n   <li><strong>After weeks of seeking to avoid scrutiny, Cummings acknowledged he had made repeated journeys away from his residence.</strong> In a highly unusual move, the unelected adviser used No 10 as the backdrop for a personal press conference called, it was said, to give him a chance to explain his reasoning. For weeks, Downing Street had declined opportunities to substantively address questions about Cummings\u2019 adherence to lockdown instructions.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/uk-coronavirus-live-boirs-johnson-dominic-cummings-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5#block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5\">Cummings claimed to have driven 60 miles to test his eyesight.</a></strong> Seeking to explain his decision to drive his wife and young son to a local beauty spot from his parents\u2019 residence, where he had taken the family during the lockdown, Cummings said he was unsure his eyesight was up to the drive to London and wanted to test it out. The prime minister later insisted he believed the excuse was plausible.</li> \n   <li><strong><a

Durham police watchdog formally asked the force to investigate Cummings.</a> </strong>Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner, asked for an investigation to establish the facts around the prime minister\u2019s principal adviser\u2019s time in the Durham area during the lockdown.</li> \n   <li><strong><a

shops are to be allowed to reopen from 1 June, the prime minister announced.</a></strong> Johnson said he was allowing outdoor markets and car showrooms to open because their open nature means they represent a lower risk than indoor places.</li> \n   <li><strong><a

  "<p><em>History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</em></p> <p>Back in the early days of the Covid-19 lockdown there was a tendency to talk, hopefully, about the many opportunities for self-improvement confinement would provide. One suggestion was that people would start reading James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, the most brilliant, and brilliantly difficult, novel of the 20th century.</p> <p>So how did that work out? Anyone get past \u201cfluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury\u2019s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries\u201d before collapsing into the sofa cushions, overcome by the urge to read Tintin in America?</p> <p>The big thing about Ulysses \u2013 other than being more difficult to engage with than, say, Friends \u2013 is that it\u2019s about everything. Joyce presents the entire human condition in a stream of consciousness, the streets of Dublin as a microcosm of the universe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/07/world-cup-questions-zinedine-zidane-head-butt-2006-berlin-france-italy-marco-materazzi\">World Cup questions: what did Zidane's head-butt in Berlin mean? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which is all very well, but after six weeks of brain freeze even glancing at its pages is likely to produce feelings similar to being stabbed through the eye with a knitting needle dipped in industrial glue.</p> <p>No matter, though. It turns out there are less punishing ways to see a world in a grain of sand. You don\u2019t need Ulysses to find a sense of deeper meaning in these sport-free times. Thankfully we also have the online Fifa World Cup archive, Saint\u2011\u00c9tienne 1998, and England versus Argentina.</p> <p>What a game this was. Watching it back without the brainswipe of empire-sad Angledribble flagwave (cod-Joyce translation: \u201cwithout watching it as a fan\u201d) two things are immediately clear.</p> <p>First, this is surely one of the great World Cup last-16 matches. And second, it feels as if it is something much bigger, an occasion that manages to tease an entire potted history of England-football-versus-the-world from a two-and-a-half-hour knockout game.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a very good England team. It's a team packed with creativity; perhaps, as it turns out, recklessly so</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s all there in the details: from hope, to dashed hope, to celebrity obsession, to the tactical culture wars that circled English football through the 20th century. In its own way Saint\u2011\u00c9tienne is a kind of footballing Ulysses. Only a much easier one. With Michael Owen and Ariel Ortega in it. And with some really, really good goals.</p> <p>It is also an uplifting occasion. It is tempting at times to view the entire backstory of England football\u2019s engagements with the outside world as a place shrouded in pre-enlightenment gloom, inhabited by blockheads and blazered fools. But, of course, it wasn\u2019t always like this.</p> <p>Those years from Euro 96 to France 98 were a notably fun, frisky interlude, a time of progressive leadership under Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, staffed by a really fine crop of early Premiership players.</p> <p>Hoddle\u2019s squad for France 98 was drawn from 11 clubs. It contained 12 players with fewer than 20 caps, six aged 23 or under. His four strikers were Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, Teddy Sheringham and Les Ferdinand, which meant Hoddle could afford to omit two of the Premier League\u2019s joint top-scorers that season, Dion Dublin and Chris Sutton (Owen being the third).</p> <p>Also left out was Andy Cole, a hammer of the Champions League the following year. Robbie Fowler and Ian Wright were injured (Wright appears in the Fifa film wrapped in a flag in the stands). Matt Le Tissier and Stan Collymore had been tried and discarded.</p> <p>This is a story of talent \u2013 England had a glut of it \u2013 and the way those small sporting variables, from elements of chance to mistakes magnified by pressure, end up framing the way the tale is told.</p> <p>In the Fifa film Saint-\u00c9tienne looks beautiful as the teams walk out, a mix of lurid green and deep blue. England are in brilliant white. The hills in the background peep in over the lip of the stand. The equally beautiful David Beckham is also present, seen here in his pre-modern puppyish blond fop stage. The camera seems to swoon as it frames him in the centre circle, back-lit by the evening sun, a 23-year-old still at the start of his own extraordinary fast-forward trip through the popular culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4288d502f9a40051208dbdc123c72ab90789a694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4288d502f9a40051208dbdc123c72ab90789a694/0_3_2244_1347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England fans wait for kick-off in Saint-\u00c9tienne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England fans wait for kick-off in Saint-\u00c9tienne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Allsport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We get a pan of the England bench as the game kicks off: teenage Rio Ferdinand, eager-looking Gareth Southgate, Paul Merson japing and laughing. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it is safe to assume that during the hours that follow Merson is always japing and laughing, that this is a continuous state of being.</p> <p>England lost to Romania in the group stage but progressed thanks to a 2-0 defeat of Colombia. Here they start in a 3-5-2 with Darren Anderton and Graeme Le Saux as wing-backs, and a central three of Paul Ince, Paul Scholes and Beckham. Sol Campbell, Tony Adams and Gary Neville is the back three. Shearer and Owen up front. This is a very good England team. It\u2019s also a team packed with creativity; perhaps, as it turns out, recklessly so.</p> <p>But then this was a World Cup stuffed full of brilliant footballers. The reward for victory in Saint-\u00c9tienne would be a quarter-final against the Netherlands (Bergkamp, Davids, Seedorf), who had beaten Yugoslavia (Mijatovic, Stojkovic, Savicevic) the night before in Toulouse.</p> <p>Argentina were without Fernando Redondo, discarded by Daniel Passarella partly under the \u201cno long hair\u201d rule (also banned: homosexuality and earrings). But they came to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard having beaten Japan, Jamaica and Croatia without conceding a goal, with Gabriel Batistuta already on four for the tournament, and with Ortega, Juan Ver\u00f3n, Javier Zanetti and Hern\u00e1n Crespo to follow.</p> <p>Ortega starts the game at the tip of a midfield diamond, with Claudio L\u00f3pez close by as a roving No 10. From the early moments Argentina\u2019s game is all depth and layers and short vertical passes, looking to find space between England\u2019s more rigid lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd8164474bf07cdc1c1fe007b8bfd09ed6ff63f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd8164474bf07cdc1c1fe007b8bfd09ed6ff63f3/0_249_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Seaman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Seaman watches as Gabriel Batistuta\u2019s sixth-minute penalty goes into the net.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a hard, fast opening, Beckham and Scholes pressing manically to fill the holes. Ver\u00f3n and Zanetti are striding about the pitch like a pair of polo\u2011playing dukes. Campbell intercepts at full stretch and you remember what a magnificently assured, pure defender he was even in those early years.</p> <p>England should score two minutes in. Batistuta gives the ball to Owen, who turns and runs into space. The ball breaks. Le Saux drives in a low cross just too deep for Shearer\u2019s lunge. For a few seconds the way Owen moved in that moment just sort of hangs there, like a glitch or a fluke. Did that really happen?</p> <p>Then from nowhere Argentina have a penalty. David Seaman rushes out to intercept a diagonal pass. Diego Simeone nicks the ball away, waits for Seaman\u2019s lunge, then falls over him. Adams does his bespoke double-handed diving gesture, but he\u2019s wrong. This was just clever play. Seaman looks crestfallen.</p> <p>Shearer makes a token effort to walk across Batistuta\u2019s eyeline as he spots the kick, but the shot is low and hard enough to bounce in off Seaman\u2019s hand. Argentina are 1-0 up with five minutes gone.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Beware the horns of a bull, the heels of the horse, and the smile of an Englishman</em>.</p> <p>England react like an England team react, running about with great energy, Ince snapping into challenges, Beckham trying to force the game. Almost immediately they find a way back, made by a poor pass from Ver\u00f3n. The ball bounces awkwardly, Ver\u00f3n and Nelson Vivas run forward into the same space. Scholes spots the mistake and heads the ball cleverly in behind them.</p> <p>And there it is: Owen in open ground, apparently operating to an entirely separate set of physical rules. Roberto Ayala tries to intercept, arms behind him, but he looks terrified of this kid, this white-shirted blur. Owen goes down in the area. Penalty.</p> <p>On the bench Hoddle leaps up and punches the air, splendidly turned out in a bright red polo shirt and baggy blue trousers. Simeone annoys Ince, stamping across the area as Shearer waits to take the kick.</p> <p>Shearer doesn\u2019t flinch. He smashes the ball past Carlos Roa and into the top corner, a nerveless, brilliant penalty kick. It\u2019s 1-1 and for a moment the air looks too heavy to breathe. The England end is bouncing and tumbling, damp with sweat and evening dew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63d06aa94151fb19e5132a1ea87970919eda22b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d06aa94151fb19e5132a1ea87970919eda22b0/33_0_1373_965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Shearer snacks his penalty past Argentina keeper Carlos Roa. to level the scores.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Shearer snacks his penalty past Argentina keeper Carlos Roa. to level the scores.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted Blackbrow/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But nothing feels settled, and for a while Argentina just keep the ball, giving us a moment of familiar England tournament stasis, the white shirts chasing deep in their own half, unable to get anywhere near Ortega as he takes the ball on the half turn.</p> <p>Paradoxically it is this period of possession, the white shirts shrinking back, that creates the outstanding moment of England\u2019s World Cup. With 15 minutes gone Beckham takes the ball under pressure and plays an instant pass to Owen in the centre circle. He takes the ball with a bravura flick of the heel, already on the move. And he\u2019s off now, heading towards his own little vision of the sublime.</p> <p>Owen has at times seemed a remote figure in the years since. He has been accused of lacking a certain sense of wonder in his musings as a pundit. But imagine how it feels to have lived this sporting life. Owen has said he knew, or felt, or was told as a teenager that he was already the best player his age in the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Owen runs with arms wide, grabbing the night into his chest. This is what he was born to do. Freeze that frame for ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It sounds an odd thing to say. But Owen is simply being honest. Aged 18 he saw the whole of the moon. At that moment, with Jos\u00e9 Chamot at his back and the World Cup bending to his will, Owen already knows what\u2019s about to happen next.</p> <p>He runs away from Chamot without breaking into a full sprint, keeping some gas for the next obstacle, which should be Ayala. Except Ayala is 30 metres away, back-pedalling in panic. Ayala! Come back!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa74c5f27d6e86f81d84114768e8c59b42a28ae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa74c5f27d6e86f81d84114768e8c59b42a28ae4/0_102_1650_989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Michael Owen (right) celebrates his goal with teammate David Beckham .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Michael Owen (right) celebrates his goal with teammate David Beckham .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama /Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Owen veers to the right, the second phase of a run that is basically a giant Z from the radius of the centre circle. He doesn\u2019t have to hurdle Ayala, who never even gets close. Scholes has appeared in Owen\u2019s peripheral vision by now. He ignores him, takes three high-speed steps and spanks the ball past Roa\u2019s arm and into the far top corner of the net.</p> <p>It\u2019s a moment of jaw-drop, of dead air. Owen runs past the Argentina end, arms wide, grabbing the night into his chest, cresting the perfect high. This is what he was born to do. Freeze that frame for ever.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>We walk through meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.</em></p> <p>Cut to the England bench and Merson is standing up shouting: \u201cWhata farkin goal!\u201d The England players hug Owen tenderly, reverently, as though aware of their own status as guests in this moment.</p> <p>And once again we have an echo of The Whole Story, another of those Ulysses interludes. This isn\u2019t just Peak Owen. It is arguably the greatest moment English football generated through the 1990s. Perhaps even, in the round, the best moment it has ever had.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/world-cup-questions-why-didnt-the-great-dutch-teams-of-the-1990s-win-it\">World Cup questions: Why didn\u2019t the great Dutch teams of the 1990s win it? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Look at the evidence. Here is a teenage footballer of boundless possibilities, a snapshot in time ready to explode with wealth and promise. Zoom out and Owen in Saint-\u00c9tienne speaks to a domestic league in a state of voracious transformation, a nation entering its own plastic boom times, football poised to assail and overwhelm every other aspect of popular culture. Did it get any better than this?</p> <p>All of which raises the more instant question. England are 2-1 up. They have a weapon Argentina can\u2019t contain. They will end up playing 70 minutes with 10 men. But that should also be a stage for a player who is literally too fast, too direct to contain on the break. Why didn\u2019t they win this game? Why didn\u2019t they at least score another goal?</p> <p>The obvious answer is that Argentina play Owen well from here. They do something un-English. Players begin to adapt mid-game, to read the situation. The blue shirts follow Owen when he comes deep, making him play facing his own goal.</p> <p>When Owen does get the ball in space, around the half-hour, Chamot backs away just a little, keeping his body in line, forcing Owen to his left instead. From there the shot is scuffed wide. This is all information. We know your strength. Now we have a weaker side too.</p> <p>By contrast Ince, Beckham and Scholes never really get to grips with Ortega, who is also playing brilliantly, slipping into awkward spaces, dribbling like a blue-shirted ghost. With 23 minutes gone Ortega runs across the midfield from left to right. Adams comes out to intercept but just goes sailing by like a steamship as Ortega slips the ball between his legs. No hard tactical response is offered to this threat. Adams and Campbell will simply defend heroically for the rest of this game. But they will always be playing to their limits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efeb7f223fd556f2dfe3cf47fd8b89465bbeab99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efeb7f223fd556f2dfe3cf47fd8b89465bbeab99/0_0_1799_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ariel Ortega\" width=\"1000\" height=\"869\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ariel Ortega was a handful for England\u2019s midfield with his brilliant dribbling and awareness of space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Probst/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another historic problem. For all their midfield talent England have nothing like Ver\u00f3n, a player happy to hold the ball, to rev or drop the throttle at any time. Instead England come at Argentina in square-drilled patterns and always at the same speed.</p> <p>An essay could be written here on the misuse of Scholes, with an accompanying response on the over-egging of the alleged misuse of Scholes, a balm for every other falling-short. But you can see it in Saint-\u00c9tienne.</p> <p>Scholes is trying to be three midfielders in one. He bombs forward, almost putting England 3-1 up, but screaming to himself as he watches his shot go wide. Scholes is also required to defend (there\u2019s one full-bodied collision with Simeone: both men just get up and play on). He also has the Ver\u00f3n-style capacity to pass and keep the ball too, which he does, but not enough.</p> <p>At times Scholes looks exhausted in that first half. Talent is being wasted in front of our eyes, overstretched by a confusion of roles.</p> <p>Ortega, meanwhile, is free to float and create, and England are holding on as we enter stoppage time. Argentina are awarded a free\u2011kick. Batistuta shapes to shoot as he has once already. The wall creeps forward, a little comically, but leaving space behind it, into which Zanetti wanders untracked.</p> <p>Ver\u00f3n\u2019s nudged free-kick is perfectly weighted. Zanetti shoots powerfully into the top corner, a wonderful piece of improvised execution. And almost immediately the players are off. The score is 2-2. Argentina have been the better team. England have the tools to win this game, but the flow of their attacks has been disrupted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Would a more ruthless, more experienced manager have replaced Beckham with David Batty at half\u2011time? England desperately need to shut down Ortega. Beckham is having a poor game. Ver\u00f3n is reading his angles, his habit of dropping off, spinning and playing diagonal passes.</p> <p>Ince and Batty is a stronger shield in exactly the place England are being hurt. Later Argentina will play with two No 10s as Marcelo Gallardo comes on. Batty will come on and shut that space down effectively. This is all hindsight. But it is also there in the pattern of the game. Hoddle will have seen it.</p> <p>Instead, we have The Event. Moments after the restart Beckham is off the field and Saint-\u00c9tienne is providing another big fat note, another wormhole into the complete Joycean history of modern-day England football.</p> <p>Simeone fouls Beckham, going through the back of him just over the halfway line. He decides to get full value for the imminent yellow card, pressing down with his hand as he levers himself up. Beckham almost lets it go. Instead he kicks out. Simeone falls backwards.</p> <p>Cue uproar from the blue shirts, and a moment of eerie calm as the Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen walks around for a bit, then dolefully produces his red card. Beckham walks off without complaint.</p> <p>The decision is entirely correct. Beckham has simply been outsmarted by the 28-year-old captain of Argentina, a player who has been in Europe for six years at three different clubs, who is an absolute hard-nosed warrior of this kind of thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87aff63d05a803aa6097866d0d571d3932cbef78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87aff63d05a803aa6097866d0d571d3932cbef78/0_261_4177_2684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham is sent off by Kim Milton Nielsen after kicking out at Diego Simeone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham is sent off by Kim Milton Nielsen after kicking out at Diego Simeone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The subsequent response was, of course, hysterical but also telling. This was never an act of national betrayal, nor a sign of outrageous arrogance. No fatal flaw was exposed. Beckham made a mistake, but he was also young, handsome and an irresistibly snippable tall poppy.</p> <p>The headlines, the effigy-hanging, the idea of some debt to the nation to discharge: this was in itself the problem, the cultural baggage, a shared confusion exposed by a moment of error.</p> <p>It was also another major step on Beckham\u2019s own journey into the cultural mainstream. No English footballer has ever leveraged his celebrity so effectively. But then, the world was still new in 1998, the stage still there to be grabbed, footballers still pop star-ish figures; or indeed still capable of finding this a worthwhile pursuit.</p> <p>With Beckham the paradox remains that he was a very good, consistent footballer, and above all a hardworking and diligent pro, albeit one whose celebrity would continually intrude from the sidelines.</p> <p>Can you feel it? We\u2019re almost out of space. We\u2019re only 50 minutes in here and the scale of the occasion is already expanding. There was still time for England to make what looks in retrospect like a tactical mistake, shifting to 4-4-1, with Owen, the obvious threat, shunted to the left wing.</p> <p>In keeping with barrack room hierarchies, Shearer would remain the spearhead. He was still a wonderful player. He defended brilliantly. But he would spend the next 70 minutes wrestling with Chamot and Ayala, playing in their most comfortable spaces. The real cost of losing Beckham was losing Owen too.</p> <p>The game is still frantic and breathless, but England have settled in for a heroically disciplined struggle to the line. Southgate comes on for the injured Le Saux, Merson for the exhausted Scholes. Owen finally gets the ball in a deep central area with 11 minutes left and is battered to the ground by Ayala.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18b1bf60cda046fc87053e228ef2d0d2b7f6bede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18b1bf60cda046fc87053e228ef2d0d2b7f6bede/116_244_2871_1721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sol Campbell (left) of England rises to head the ball into the back of the Argentina net, but the goal is disallowed for Alan Shearer\u2019s elbow on goalkeeper Carlos Roa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Sol Campbell (left) rises to head the ball into the back of the Argentina net, but the goal is disallowed for Alan Shearer\u2019s elbow on goalkeeper Carlos Roa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Allsport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is time for another weird interlude. Campbell heads Anderton\u2019s corner into the net and runs off celebrating, unaware that Argentina are breaking downfield behind him, the goal having been ruled out \u2013 correctly \u2013 for Shearer\u2019s foul on Roa. An underrated moment: the man making the tackle to block Crespo at the other end is Anderton himself, who has run back the length of the pitch, from corner-taker to last man.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Our national epic has yet to be written.</em></p> <p>It is a gruelling denouement. The Beckham sending-off feels as if it was another world altogether by now. Ince has a wonderful half-hour of extra time, still running and dribbling and tackling.</p> <p>Simeone comes off, injured and furious, but keeps popping back on in full kit during the breaks to scream at his teammates. Everyone is wide-eyed and glistening. Seaman\u2019s hair has become a single majestically sculpted and sodden mass, the kind of hair it takes three hours in the stylist\u2019s chair to attain.</p> <p>At the final whistle you can feel where the shootout is heading. Argentina are the more technically accomplished team, penalties are the most basic test of skills under pressure. Roa is also worrying. His whole look is unconventional. He could be off to the skateboard park, or on his way to a modern art happening. This kind of goalkeeper is to be feared in a shootout.</p> <p>Shearer spanks his kick hard down the middle, after Berti\u2019s opener. Seaman saves from Crespo. Then: disaster. Ince takes exactly the same kick and Roa also saves.</p> <p>Ver\u00f3n\u2019s kick is a work of art but Merson puts his away easily. Gallardo makes it 3-2 but Owen takes a sensational penalty, then wheels away grinning. Where, exactly, has he been? Ayala puts Argentina 4-3 up and Batty has to score. It\u2019s down the centre, straight on to Roa\u2019s uplifted palm. Cue the pile-on of blue shirts, and last lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f09c7f77c62f5be0ca0cdb08c6b2fc55c48aa52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f09c7f77c62f5be0ca0cdb08c6b2fc55c48aa52/0_113_1425_856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Ver\u00f3n, Marcelo Gallardo, Ariel Ortega and Sergio Berti are jubilant as David Batty\u2019s penalty is saved\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Ver\u00f3n, Marcelo Gallardo, Ariel Ortega and Sergio Berti are jubilant as David Batty\u2019s penalty is saved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Garcia/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What to make of all this plenitude, this fecundity of themes and details?

  "<p>My friend Graham Ball, who has died aged 69 after a fall, was one of Fleet Street\u2019s old school. His career stretched from tabloid expos\u00e9s to investigations for the TV series The Cook Report, campaigns for the Independent on Sunday and literary reviews for the Express titles.</p> <p>A man of wide interests, he took a BA in history at Birkbeck College, London, in his 50s and worked towards an MA on wartime propaganda in his retirement. Cricket was a passion. In 1978 he founded the Grub Street Casuals, a team of rackety hacks, and for two decades captained and led the bowling attack.</p> <p>Graham was born in Rochford, Essex, the elder son of Alec Ball, a draughtsman with British Telecom, and his wife, Joyce (nee Cox). After leaving Southend high school, he won a place on the Mirror Group training scheme in Plymouth, a spawning ground for numerous national journalists. There he met his future wife, Tessa Hilton, who later edited the Sunday Mirror.</p> <p>In 1972 he joined the Sunday People. During an expos\u00e9 of the convicted paedophile Roger Gleaves, self-styled \u201cbishop of Medway\u201d, Graham and two other reporters rescued a victim who had fallen back into Gleaves\u2019s clutches, and hid him in a country cottage. The victim was due to be a witness in a private prosecution brought by Gleaves, who convinced a district judge that the reporters were unlawfully withholding his witness. The trio spent a night in Brixton prison before Mirror Group lawyers secured their release.</p> <p>In the 1990s Graham went freelance. In 1997 he was with The Cook Report in Cyprus, researching the fugitive fraudster Asil Nadir, whose company Polly Peck had collapsed in 1991 with debts of \u00a31.3bn. Roger Cook remembers: \u201cNadir was a charmer, but Graham saw through him. He pursued the story relentlessly until we had the ammunition we needed. Once we had to travel between the north and south of the divided island. Graham found a man whose abandoned house straddled the border and for a small fee we left the north through his front door and arrived in the south through the back.\u201d</p> <p>He then joined the Independent on Sunday and masterminded the editor Rosie Boycott\u2019s campaign to decriminalise cannabis. He also travelled with Unicef, reporting on the plight of children in Cambodia and the Philippines. He ended his newspaper career as books editor of the Express titles.</p> <p>Graham is remembered by many as a kind and big-hearted man; a great conversationalist and humorist, still collecting stories wherever he happened to be. He is survived by Tessa, whom he married in 1976, his children, Oscar, Thomas and Rebecca, and four grandchildren.</p>",

  "<p>It is rare nowadays for a playwright to trigger public controversy and furore to the same extent as did the German writer Rolf Hochhuth in the 1960s, with stage dramas about the alleged indifference of the Catholic church, and specifically Pope Pius XII, to the Holocaust, and an implication that Winston Churchill was behind the 1943 air crash that killed the Polish military leader General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski.</p> <p>Hochhuth, who has died aged 89, wrestled the shared guilt of his nation\u2019s commitment to nazism into the public arena and in so doing revealed an ability to dramatise both sides of an argument, while pillorying public figures who perpetrated, or appeared to condone, the death camps and the area bombing of civilian targets.</p> <p>Both these major plays, about the pope and Churchill, were premiered in Berlin and performed in London. Der Stellvertreter (The Representative), at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1963, with the pope played first by Alan Webb, then by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryeric-porter-1619844.html\" title=\"\">Eric Porter</a>, had a design by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/18/ralph-koltai-obituary\" title=\"\">Ralph Koltai</a> in which \u2013 as in the script \u2013 a Nazi gas chamber dissolved into the papal throne room in the Vatican.</p> <p>Soldaten (Soldiers), in the West End in early 1969, had been the source of a furious backstage row at the National Theatre between its chair, Lord (Oliver) Chandos, who had served in Churchill\u2019s war cabinet, and its artistic director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/11/laurence-olivier-25-years-anniversary-death\" title=\"\">Laurence Olivier</a>, who defended his right to present it, even though he was a Churchill loyalist.

Tynan saw Hochhuth\u2019s play as a means of emulating the RSC\u2019s radical strain of work, in their production not only of The Representative but also in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/peter-brook\" title=\"\">Peter Brook</a>\u2019s sensational stagings of Peter Weiss\u2019s Marat/Sade and of US, a multi-authored play denouncing the war in Vietnam, with the onstage burning of \u201clive\u201d butterflies.</p> <p>Against this background, Soldiers was deferred by Tynan and the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/09/michael-white-producer-obituary\" title=\"\">Michael White</a> until the inevitable demise of the lord chamberlain in 1968. But it ran for only three months at the New theatre (now the No\u00ebl Coward) and the producers suffered a heavy defeat in a libel case brought by the pilot of the plane on which Sikorski was travelling who had, unknown to them, survived the crash. Tynan and White recovered their losses by producing their Broadway nude revue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/jul/28/oh-calcutta-kenneth-tynan-review\" title=\"\">Oh, Calcutta! </a>at the Roundhouse in 1970.</p> <p>Hochhuth\u2019s plays \u2013 verbose and traditional in construction \u2013 are written in free verse, with flashes of theatrical fireworks amid swathes of detailed argument.

Piscator agreed to produce Der Stellvertreter if the author would cut it from nine hours to four. He did.</p> <p>The subject of the play had already been broached on stage by the French dramatist and screenwriter Armand Gatti, but Hochhuth drilled right down to the moral and ethical issues, as he did in all his writing. MacDonald, a friend and colleague of both Piscator and Hochhuth, denied that the latter ever falsified history, although he could, he admitted, be accused of selecting his facts to fit a thesis \u2013 \u201cbut so can every single historian since Gibbon\u201d.</p> <p>Among the Hochhuth plays MacDonald translated and directed in Glasgow were Judith, a 1984 world premiere, about the assassination of an American president, in the metaphorical context of a 1943 Nazi censorship of a play about the biblical heroine killing Holofernes; and a glittering conversation piece, Mozart\u2019s Nachtmusik (2002), in which the composer\u2019s death was not attributed to Salieri (as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/06/sir-peter-shaffer-obituary\" title=\"\">Peter Shaffer</a>\u2019s Amadeus) but to a jealous court official whose wife was Mozart\u2019s last pupil and mistress.</p> <p>Also in 2002, Costa-Gavras made a powerful film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/12/1\" title=\"\">Amen</a>, based on one strand of Der Stellvertreter, in which a fictional young Jesuit protests against the pope\u2019s silence by donning a yellow star and boarding a train for Auschwitz. </p> <p>Hochhuth was planning a production of a play about Coco Chanel \u2013 and her conduct and allegiances during the occupation of France \u2013 to be directed in Berlin by Klaus Maria Brandauer. He remained a controversialist, excoriating his government for bailing out what he called Greece\u2019s \u201csham\u201d bankruptcy and petitioning Angela Merkel to grant the whistleblower Edward Snowden asylum \u2013 it was a moral duty, he said, for Germans to do so \u201cin the light of our shameful past\u201d.</p> <p>He is survived by his fourth wife, Johanna Binger, whom he married in 2009; and by two sons, Martin and Fritz, from his marriage to Marianne, which ended in 1972 in divorce.

Tyson Foods was forced to suspend operations at the end of April after 180 coronavirus infections were linked to the plant.</p> <p>There was a similar story in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which became<a href=\"https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/mc-nws-pa-why-hazleton-20200412-mve5o6dpi5eb5pq2os3zmrbavq-story.html\"> one of the worst-hit areas</a> early on in the crisis.

In Wisconsin, the supreme court chief justice, Patience Roggensack, was criticized in early May after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chief-justice-condemned-for-blaming-coronavirus-spread-on-meatpackers-2020-5\">she seemed to downplay</a> a coronavirus outbreak among workers at a meatpacking facility in Brown county, where a large proportion of the workers are minorities and immigrants.</p> <p>\u201c[The surge in coronavirus cases] was due to the meatpacking \u2013 that\u2019s where Brown county got the flare,\u201d Roggensack said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the regular folks in Brown county.\u201d</p> <p>Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the Wisconsin-based <a href=\"https://vdlf.org/\">Voces de la Frontera</a> immigrant-rights group, criticized Roggensack\u2019s remarks as \u201celitist\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d, and told the Guardian that Latinos had been subjected to \u201clegalized discrimination\u201d through their work.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a question they have been discriminated against, because they are disproportionately more vulnerable to exposure and to having them or their families or their community impacted by the Covid-19,\u201d Neumann-Ortiz said.</p> <p>If there is one positive, Neumann-Ortiz said, it\u2019s that the backlash could trigger a greater effort to change workplace conditions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s forcing workplace organizing to happen, in a way that wasn\u2019t there before because the stakes are so high,\u201d Neumann-Ortiz said.

Several others have been shot \u2013 or shot at \u2013 including one who was targeted just hours after Kinani\u2019s death.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian following Kinani\u2019s murder, Ontario\u2019s ministry of transportation said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the violence in the towing industry and was working to \u201cdeter this behaviour\u201d.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-in-the-gtas-tow-truck-turf-wars-the-race-for-profit-leads-to-road/\">recent investigation</a> by the Globe and Mail found at least 30 arson attacks targeting tow-truck businesses, though that figure has now risen since the spike in violence over the last few months.</p> <p>In March, a collision reporting centre in northern Toronto was set on fire.

Last June, police conducted a series of raids under the name Project Kraken, charging more than 70 people \u2013 including seven drivers \u2013 with offenses ranging from firearms possession to conspiracy to commit murder.</p> <p>Police recovered Tasers and body armour, and found that numerous drivers were armed and \u201cprepared to shoot other tow-truck operators over an ongoing battle over territory\u201d, said Toronto\u2019s police deputy chief, James Ramer.</p> <p>But nearly a year after those high-profile raids, critics say the problems have only got worse.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got guys racing down the highway to be the first to arrive for a tow, threaten each other, bang into each other and even shoot each other. Things need to change,\u201d said John Henderson of the Fair Towing Task Force, a lobby group advocating for industry reform.</p> <p>Henderson and others have called for greater regulation and licensing, as well as the establishment of an oversight body, to rein in what they say is an increasingly saturated industry with few clear standards.</p> <p>\u201cTrucks are just popping up every few days with new names and faces, and then they disappear just as fast. Their one motive is to eliminate competition and own the road. It\u2019s crazy these days,\u201d said the driver.</p> <p>In theory, the towing industry is regulated at a municipal level in Ontario, but according to the Canadian Automobile Association, only 17 of Ontario\u2019s 444 municipalities have clear rules, meaning swaths of the province have become a free-for-all for drivers looking to circumvent or exploit exiting loopholes.</p> <p>Companies say they also want clear regulations for truck maintenance and safety \u2013 as well as better training standards for drivers.</p> <p>Henderson says a number of \u201cunscrupulous\u201d drivers are using modified trucks \u2013 not actual tow trucks. \u201cIf an unlicensed, unregulated guy picks up your vehicle, he\u2019s never going to see you again. He\u2019s going to charge you as much as he thinks you\u2019re going to pay.\u201d</p> <p>With the government preoccupied by the coronavirus pandemic, businesses worry that legislation that has been repeatedly proposed will once again be forgotten.</p> <p>But Henderson hopes the recent shooting will put lingering crisis back in the spotlight.</p> <p>\u201cBecause let\u2019s be clear: someone was killed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to fix this.\u201d</p>",

It also runs an income-generating programme for women and girls to make sanitary pads, which they sell at school or in their communities.

Another 3,000 are currently planned.</p> <p>African Masks, as they are dubbed, rely on networks of local tailors and volunteers working to an approved pattern. Each mask has two layers of bright African textiles and a pocket for a disposable filter. In Kenya, the masks are made by fashion house Tenge Vuli; in Nigeria, Senegal and the DRC by local tailors.</p> <p>Serralta had a number of contacts to call on when trying to find local partners for the venture, she says, from women\u2019s groups to human rights defenders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"113fa3842b66db4c617c3fbc3be0baf6d16a1ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/113fa3842b66db4c617c3fbc3be0baf6d16a1ffb/0_38_1278_787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Masks being distributed in Goma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks being distributed in Goma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Goma Actif/AfricanMasks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The venture has contributed to the local economies at a time of major upheaval. \u201cThe tailors have been very grateful for the work because at the moment with the lockdown it\u2019s really challenging,\u201d says Serralta.</p> <p>\u201cIn Kenya, the project has helped employ people for nearly a month when otherwise they\u2019d have had very little or no work. For anyone who\u2019s been in one of Africa\u2019s big cities or even the informal settlements, the social distancing is a big challenge. Making masks was an attempt to protect people and their communities.\u201d</p> <p>Distribution has been left entirely up to the local partners, says Serralta, who chose the recipients on a needs basis. In Kenya, the masks were given to stallholders at a market which had seen two cases; in the DRC, volunteers handed out masks to minibus and taxi drivers.</p> <p>\u201cThis really is a project of international solidarity,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe initiative in terms of fundraising came from me, but the initiative to do something about Covid came from all the people on the ground. They didn\u2019t wait for the government to act, they stepped in and stepped up right from the start.

  "<p>When the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kraftwerk\">Kraftwerk</a> co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/06/florian-schneider-kraftwerk-co-founder-dies-aged-73\">Florian Schneider was announced last week</a>, the loudest tributes came from the electronic music community. Kraftwerk\u2019s pioneering approach, using synthesisers and sequenced drum arrangements to evoke robotic or industrial rhythms, became the blueprint for Detroit musicians such as Juan Atkins, who coined the term \u201ctechno\u201d. Forty years later, an array of electronic genres have been created from that blueprint: Schneider and Kraftwerk created a feedback loop between Germany and Detroit that has existed for more than half a century.</p> <p>When Schneider and Ralf H\u00fctter started Kraftwerk in 1970, their influences included several Detroit-based acts including the Stooges, MC5 and, according to later member Karl Bartos, Berry Gordy\u2019s Motown label. Gordy initially worked for the Ford motor plant, and gave Motown an industrialised music production-line inspired by Detroit\u2019s automotive industry. This was the ice-breaker in the conversation between his city and Germany \u2013 Kraftwerk\u2019s automated drums, vocoder refrains and future-facing outlook also stemmed from the conveyor belts, piston-driven machinery and monotonous rhythm of factory life. This inescapable repetition of sound and movement \u2013 programmed, precise \u2013 was present in Detroit and Dusseldorf, both industrial centres.</p> <p>Released in 1974, Autobahn provided Kraftwerk\u2019s international breakthrough, setting the wheels in motion for their first tour of the US in 1975. It was a moderate success, but if it hadn\u2019t been for radio and club play \u2013 and the record shops that supplied those DJs \u2013 then Kraftwerk would not have had the impact they did. Downtown Records in New York was one of many spots where Afrika Bambaataa would pick up the records he played in his legendary freeform sets at block parties in the Bronx. Known for its eclectic stock, Downtown (and other similarly idiosyncratic outlets) helped deliver Kraftwerk\u2019s avant-garde sounds to America\u2019s black communities. On the radio in NYC, Frankie Crocker was spinning Kraftwerk records on his WBLS show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec04dc239d0970658a8711f0aba56b88f391ba23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec04dc239d0970658a8711f0aba56b88f391ba23/0_332_3629_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An automobile production line\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Kraftwerk\u2019s automated drums, vocoder refrains and future-facing outlook also stemmed from the conveyor belts, piston-driven machinery and monotonous rhythm of factory life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Library of Congress/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Detroit, Charles Johnson, more commonly known as the Electrifying Mojo, commanded the airwaves via WGPR-FM. His unconstrained programming attracted a huge following, introducing his audience to obscure European imports and US acts including Prince. Kraftwerk were among the European artists receiving regular play on his show, where Numbers was a staple. In Motor City, the decline of the car industry led to a city-wide economic crash. Science fiction and technology provided optimism, a means to escape, a channel to a brighter future. The situation was similar in postwar Germany: by turning their gaze to the future, Kraftwerk offered hope and new beginnings. Their sound of the future, driven by American rhythms, resonated with the nonconformist presenter, and his support for the group was undoubtedly a catalyst contributing to the birth of techno.</p> <p>Lauded by Mojo\u2019s listeners and Bambaataa\u2019s crowd, Kraftwerk\u2019s music made its way into the clubs, even featuring on Detroit\u2019s legendary Soul Train-inspired dance show the Scene, later replaced by the New Dance Show. In New York, their songs were also regular features on the dancefloor, which the group witnessed first hand when Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian took Schneider and H\u00fctter out to experience NYC\u2019s underground clubs in 1981. It was inevitable that their experiences in black and Latino clubs would lead to the creation of music that fed straight back into those very communities.</p> <p>Juan Atkins was an avid listener to Mojo\u2019s show. As with Bambaataa\u2019s iconic Planet Rock, produced with Arthur Baker (another Kraftwerk fan), Atkins\u2019 early work draws heavily on Kraftwerk\u2019s tropes and themes. Upon hearing their sequenced drum programming, he immediately adopted the technique to mimic the group\u2019s tight, robotic rhythms. As Model 500, Atkins used warped vocals and intergalactic computerised effects to envision the future from a Motor City perspective. (Kraftwerk\u2019s influence also made its way to Chicago.)</p> <p>New wave, early synth pop, the new romantics, London\u2019s Blitz kids, OMD, David Bowie, Gary Numan, Visage, Depeche Mode, Soft Cell and many other groups from the post-industrial early 80s ushered in the first generation of popular music that was entirely created with electronic instruments. Initially niche, it soon went mainstream and travelled across the continent, resulting in a new wave of homegrown German electronic acts such as Boytronic, Rheingold, DAF and Stratis. In 1988, Virgin released Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit, compiled by Neil Rushton. It introduced Europe to the first wave of Detroit techno artists, Blake Baxter, Derrick May and Eddie Fowlkes among them. This first wave of electronic music, inspired largely by Kraftwerk and their electropop offspring, was the US\u2019s reply to the German group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fc59499c9b1774350bdf66e63690e91a6c7b59b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fc59499c9b1774350bdf66e63690e91a6c7b59b/20_211_4831_2898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berlin\u2019s famous Berghain nightclub\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berlin\u2019s famous Berghain nightclub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iain Masterton/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the 90s approached, radio DJs such as Monika Dietl were educating Berliners on both sides of the Berlin wall; Mark Ernestus, founder of record shop Hard Wax, was intrinsic to bringing the Detroit sound to the German capital. The fall of the wall in 1989 was pivotal: empty warehouses, factories and derelict buildings provided the perfect opportunity for the city\u2019s large community of outliers to enjoy their newfound freedom to the fullest. Clubs such as Planet, UFO, E-Werk and Tresor became hubs for the new sound. A faction of Detroit\u2019s second generation of techno artists had pushed the genre into a more minimal, uncompromising incarnation, which resonated with Berlin\u2019s punks and misfits. The mood evolved to become more militaristic, the BPMs went up, the vocals disappeared, the rhythms remained monotonous and hypnotic. It transformed into a hardcore hybrid of Underground Resistance-style techno, EBM and gabba, which flourished among Berlin\u2019s anarchistic creative communities.</p> <p>Around this time, Ernestus traveled to Detroit with Thomas Fehlmann and Moritz von Oswald, with whom he later formed pioneering dub techno act Basic Channel. Their mission was to meet their Detroit heroes and gather up analogue equipment that had been offloaded at many of the city\u2019s pawn shops. They met Mike Banks and Juan Atkins, turning up unannounced at an apartment they shared. This connection would lead to a 25-year-long collaborative relationship and friendship. Meanwhile, Tresor founder Dimitri Hegemann booked Atkins to play along with Mike Banks and Underground Resistance. Soon after the club\u2019s launch, Tresor\u2019s label wing appeared: their first signing was Underground Resistance as X-101. Tresor also signed two of Drexciya\u2019s albums, Harnessed the Storm and Neptune\u2019s Lair, and music from Atkins, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills and Blake Baxter. Dimitri inspired the conception of Atkins\u2019 Borderland project with Von Oswald.</p> <p>Once again, rhythm and musical language stimulated the flow of communication between the two cities. Underground Resistance\u2019s anger, political commentary and paramilitary aesthetic, expressed through their uncompromising music, spoke to reunified Berlin and its hardcore punks and hippies. Clubs with virtually no rules and powerful sound systems provided an emotional outlet for the once-divided city, prompting the birth of the first generation of Berlin techno pioneers. Once that connection was made, only the UK could compete in terms of its burgeoning dance music culture and allure for international artists, though it didn\u2019t last \u2013 1994\u2019s Criminal Justice Bill strangling the emergent rave scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e4d8ae08282b8ab551b98874d0cb01b6516faac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e4d8ae08282b8ab551b98874d0cb01b6516faac/0_0_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Revellers at Berlin\u2019s Love Parade festival, 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revellers at Berlin\u2019s Love Parade festival, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Schreiber/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As techno\u2019s popularity grew in Germany \u2013 Berlin\u2019s infamous Love Parade started in 1989 and blossomed into a million-strong party by 1997, and alternative techno centres emerged in Cologne and Frankfurt \u2013 it became fringe in the US. The music moved back underground, as corporate-owned radio and TV stations shifted to commercial dance releases. It reached the point where artists from the States were playing more in Europe than they were in their own country, with a far greater number of techno clubs and festivals providing more demand and more opportunity. But the musical conversation and mutual respect between the two territories has never ceased. In the 2000s, a wave of Detroit selectors including Magda, Seth Troxler, Matthew Dear and Derek Plaslaiko migrated to Berlin. Artists such as Carl Craig and Jeff Mills became closely affiliated with their European counterparts, with both men exploring classical music with orchestras on the continent, as well as launching collaborative projects, including Craig\u2019s long-running relationship with Moritz von Oswald and Francesco Tristano.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/06/florian-schneider-the-enigma-whose-codes-broke-open-pop-music\">Florian Schneider: the enigma whose codes broke open pop music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While national demand dipped, Detroit\u2019s influence on the rest of the world remained consistent.

  "<p>The first two doctors to die of Covid-19 on the NHS frontline were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52152375\">born in Sudan</a>. In the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, there is a loan shark. Until last week, junior doctors with job offers in the UK represented a reliable income stream for him. The work visas they needed came with a host of conditions, but meeting those criteria counted for nothing unless they paid, upfront, an immigration health surcharge of \u00a3400 a year for every year of their work permit, duplicated for every member of their family if they had one.</p> <p>Being recent graduates, most applicants had only pennies to their name. So the loan shark thrived, demanding an interest payment in advance, before personally entering his credit card details into the online application form.</p> <p>His business may now be in trouble. On Thursday, the British government gave in to mounting pressure and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">exempted migrant NHS staff</a> from the surcharge. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">wasn\u2019t an easily won concession</a>. Cancelling the surcharge before the anger had reached its own backbenches could have been an early and obvious win. But that\u2019s not how this government, or its Home Office, works.</p> <p>The surcharge is (not was, as it is still paid by non-NHS migrants, many on low incomes and with few public advocates) not only outrageously costly, it is also immoral. Migrants pay taxes and national insurance contributions. Subjecting them to an additional charge to use an NHS they have already contributed to amounts to exploitation.</p> <p>The fact that the government will not offer an exemption for people on low incomes, or deviate from its demand to pay in one lump sum, is a familiar feature of Home Office fee design. The policy is to put immigrants on the spot and extract as much as possible from them. On the other side of these fees there are jobs, training opportunities, university offers, spouses, partners and other loved ones to join. If you\u2019re in the country already, the downside of failing to pay such fees renders them close to extortion. Refusing to stump up means having to take your life apart and leaving the country. What\u2019ll it be: your money or your life?</p> <p>I and many friends and family members have often had to make these kinds of decisions over the years. In the middle of a long, chaotic and insulting immigration experience you put your dignity, mental health and financial stability on the one hand; and the intricate, rich life you have built in this country on the other. The scales just about balance. This is what the government bets on.</p> <p>As a result, it has built an immigration system that is geared not towards what is fair, but what it can get away with. And that is a lot. If one looks back over the last decade, two policies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\">austerity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">the hostile environment</a>, have defined the Conservative political agenda. The party not only managed to drive them through undiluted, it also spun these policies\u2019 failures, to achieve prosperity or a reduction in immigration numbers, as success.</p> <p>It is no surprise then that it took such a fight to convince the government to exempt NHS staff from the surcharge even as they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/foreign-nhs-workers-coronavirus-frontline-nhs-surcharge\">fighting a pandemic</a>. Its commitment to the policy was never about money: numbers suggests that NHS staff contributions only bring in a measly \u00a335m a year (not Boris Johnson\u2019s deliberately inflated number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/20/we-feel-insulted-migrant-health-workers-react-boris-johnson-refusal-to-scrap-nhs-surcharge\">almost a billion</a>).</p> <p>The Tory party\u2019s own MPs and peers condemned it. Politically, the surcharge put the government to the right of Ukip and at odds with the Daily Mail. But a habit forged over a decade is hard to quit overnight. The political software of nimble review and reform does not exist in the Home Office. In fact, it is inimical to the smooth running of the hostile environment, which is a complex policy infrastructure that is built for inflexibility. Combine that with this new government\u2019s rapid centralisation, fondness for unsubtle apparatchiks like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/priti-patel-says-sorry-if-people-feel-there-have-been-failings-over-ppe\">Priti Patel</a>, disdain for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-whitehall-democracy-civil-servants\">civil service</a>, plus a dash of incompetence, and you end up with an administration that responds to nothing but public shaming.</p> <p>Increasingly, the only way to get the Conservatives to ditch unethical policies is to provoke national outrage. The victims of the policies have to suffer, and then drag their pain and anger into the public realm and petition for mercy. Whether it is the suspension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">Windrush deportations</a>, free parking for NHS doctors, extending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/07/foreign-nationals-nhs-indefinite-leave-remain-coronavirus-covid-19\">indefinite leave to remain</a> to the families of all NHS staff, or this latest concession, the government only changed course when it became too embarrassing not to. There is no moral compass, no sense of responsibility over lives in its care, just a cynical cost-benefit analysis of which policies are worth the harassment in the media and at the dispatch box and which are not.</p> <p>But we get them to move. One win at a time. It does mean, though, that we can only focus on one injustice at a time. The NHS surcharge may have saved junior doctors from a loan shark in Khartoum. But with every victory a question hangs: what about the others trapped in the latticework of the government\u2019s meanness and incompetence, suffering in ways that will probably never come to light?</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Opposition politicians across Europe, from cautious centrists to firebrand populists, have had to walk a tricky political tightrope over the past two months, as coronavirus has taken over the political agenda.</p> \n<p>How to stay politically relevant while governments, even when making errors, are benefiting from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/democratic-leaders-win-surge-of-approval-during-covid-19-crisis\">\u2018rally round the flag\u2019 effect</a> and seeing approval ratings rise? And how to hold those governments responsible for their mistakes, without playing political games during a health crisis?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard balance to strike, but there have been moments where we had no choice except to fight back,\u201d admitted the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, in a recent interview at his office.</p> \n<p>In <strong>Hungary</strong>, where the overall number of coronavirus infections has remained low, the government of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has sought to portray the opposition as \u201cpro-virus\u201d, and has put the blame on Kar\u00e1csony for deaths in the capital\u2019s care homes.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was part of the government strategy for the pandemic to create and provoke direct confrontation with the opposition,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The mayor was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/17/gergely-karacsony-mayor-budapest-eu-hungary-liberal-viktor-orban\">elected last October</a> after standing against Orb\u00e1n\u2019s favoured candidate, and is seen as a potential challenger to the prime minister in nationwide elections two years from now. Perhaps with an eye on that vote, Orb\u00e1n has not sought consensus in the coronavirus response. He refused to put a time limit on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">special coronavirus legislation</a> that he pushed through parliament in late March, even though the opposition said it would support it if a sunset clause was introduced.</p> \n<p>In some countries, politicians suspended their traditional bickering at the peak of the crisis, and support for radical political alternatives dried up. In <strong>Britain</strong>, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, initially offered words of support and cooperation but then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">carefully picked certain battles</a> to highlight problematic government responses.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In <strong>Italy</strong>, the popularity of the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, soared during the crisis, with a small decline in support for the far-right Matteo Salvini. In <strong>Germany</strong>, where there is more of a tradition of consensus-based politics, most of the opposition has refrained from criticising the government up to now. In Germany, both the government and chancellor, Angela Merkel, are enjoying high popularity ratings, with 68% of Germans satisfied with Merkel, the highest of her time in office.</p> \n<p>The far-right populist AfD has struggled to be noticed since the coronavirus crisis began and has seen its popularity ratings fall considerably, while the rest of the opposition has been keen not to be seen to be rocking the boat at a difficult time, meaning it has struggled to make its presence felt.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe style of cooperative opposition is more popular in Germany than that of fundamental opposition. Germans are not only believers in the state but they love decisions made at a round table,\u201d said the political scientist Karl-Rudolf Korte in a recent interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.</p> \n<p>However, when the economic consequences of coronavirus really begin to hit, the \u201crally round the flag\u201d effect will slowly dissolve, and opposition parties could have a chance to strike.</p> \n<p>Already, there are signs that Conte\u2019s popularity levels are dropping, and with the end of lockdown in Germany, the opposition parties have declared a return to politics as usual as well. \u201cUnanimity over the question of crisis management is over,\u201d Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business FDP, said recently.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, there was never a period of unanimity in the first place, and political battles have only intensified. In <strong>Poland</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/poland-holds-ghost-election-with-0-turnout\">the government sought to plough ahead with a presidential election on 10 May</a>, in conditions where it would be almost impossible for the opposition to run a proper campaign, at a time when energy was devoted to fighting the virus. At the last minute the vote was cancelled, with a new vote tentatively planned for next month.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pandemic crisis certainly helped the Polish government to tilt the playing field so opposition candidates do not have equal opportunities during the campaign,\u201d said Edit Zgut, a visiting lecturer at the University of Warsaw. \u201cWhenever the election is scheduled, it will be far from fair.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Hungary, as recriminations between the government and the mayor of Budapest over the handling of the pandemic have increased, the discourse has got personal in rather strange ways. In a recent interview, Orb\u00e1n said Kar\u00e1csony was the sort of person who couldn\u2019t put Ikea furniture together without help. \u201cOr to put what I\u2019m talking about into a rural context, when there\u2019s a traditional pig slaughter this is someone who only turns up right at the end for dinner,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n.</p> \n<p>Kar\u00e1csony said the personal attacks prove the government is rattled by the opposition, and part of a strategy to shift the blame.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe social and economic fallout will be very severe, and they want to tackle that by starting this blame game and making the opposition look like they didn\u2019t want consensus,\u201d he said.</p>"
