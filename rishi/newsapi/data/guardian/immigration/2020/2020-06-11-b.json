  "<p>It\u2019s about the time of year in Australia where my Instagram feed is usually dotted with holiday snaps of warmer climates. People straddling scooters in Bali \u2013 that they will almost certainly fall off once their phone is put away \u2013 or sipping an obligatory Aperol spritz against an obnoxious Mediterranean backdrop.</p> <p>I had been planning a winter getaway soon: a trip to the US see my sister and cuddle a new niece or nephew while soaking up as much free-poured bourbon, late-night pizza and New York atmosphere as my annual leave and savings would allow.&nbsp;</p> <p>But because of the pandemic, this winter almost no one is getting off the island. Gyms, bars and workplaces may be slowly reopening but international borders, for the most part, are not. Even within Australia, which has largely suppressed Covid-19, our movement remains restricted by closed state lines and a collective caution about returning to crammed economy class seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/05/call-of-the-wild-eight-extraordinary-nature-encounters-across-australia\">Call of the wild: eight extraordinary nature encounters across Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Living in a world with closed borders is a nightmare for so many, especially those cut off from loved ones. No planes in the sky means hardship and heartache \u2013 people deprived of necessary income and family reunions, having to wrangle Australia\u2019s nightmarish immigration bureaucracy for compassionate visas.</p> <p>So many are deprived of the joy of holding new babies or the solace of being near a parent battling the final days of an illness. In a vast, immigrant nation, these stories are everywhere. For these and so many other reasons, the safe reopening of borders cannot come soon enough.</p> <p>On a smaller, more superficial level, closed borders and a still-raging pandemic mean the era of ubiquitous long-distance travel for pleasure and adventure is also on indefinite pause.</p> <p>Giving up our plans to roam brings a little ache for the before times. Australia feels further away from the rest of the world than ever. Our wings have been clipped.&nbsp;</p> <p>But given the state of the world and the economy, even if you could figure out how, international travel would feel like a bizarre extravagance now. Instagram no longer beckons us overseas; instead it\u2019s an important space for sharing ideas about how to defund the police.</p> <p>As with many other adjustments we\u2019ve had to make lately, I\u2019ve been surprised by how the feelings of loss and frustration around being confined to my state and country are also accompanied by little moments of acceptance and discovery.&nbsp;</p> <p>After three months of lockdown, the idea of even the smallest getaway, the shortest drive, feels truly exciting.</p> <p>Just as I have discovered that I am someone who likes staying in on a Friday to trounce my boyfriend at Trivial Pursuit, so too have I realised I am someone who can get very jazzed about the idea of a weekend in Canberra.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/21/nsw-travel-people-are-getting-iso-fever-theyre-itching-to-get-out-and-were-itching-to-have-them\">NSW travel: 'People are getting iso fever \u2013 they\u2019re itching to get out and we\u2019re itching to have them'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, Canberra! Maybe it\u2019s a whole season in isolation, but going to stare at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/heres-looking-at-blue-poles-by-jackson-pollock-51655\">Blue Poles</a>, taking a brisk walk past a problematic fountain and seeing friends I\u2019ve been separated from since the summer sounds quite thrilling.&nbsp;</p> <p>In so many ways the pandemic has forced us into simpler, more sustainable habits, ways of living that were standard for previous generations: cooking more, staying in, cutting our own hair, and playing all those damn board games. Some of it has been tedious as hell. But a lot of it has been surprisingly, well, nice? Comforting even.</p> <p>My parents and grandparents never flew when they were young or took trips very far afield. A holiday meant a sweaty drive or long train trip to visit a relative on a farm or, if you were really lucky, a cabin at Brunswick Heads. Flying was a rarity in my childhood too.&nbsp;</p> <p>But entering adulthood in the era of budget airlines and discount travel meant it was often cheaper to head overseas than to parts of Australia, and many of us have seen more of some foreign countries than we\u2019ve seen of our own.&nbsp;</p> <p>Local travel may not pack the excitement of venturing further afield but it spares you some of the stresses too: no visas or jet lag, a much smaller carbon footprint, and in most cases,&nbsp;a smaller hit to your bank balance in what are already precarious times.</p> <p>If you have the money to spend on a holiday, there is barely a part of this country that hasn\u2019t been touched by drought, bushfires or other hardships this past year, so there are plenty of places where your dollars can be spent meaningfully.</p> <p>And, as with the puzzles and baking, I\u2019m hoping to discover there\u2019s something restorative and reassuring about re-engaging with things we might have done as children, when the world is so turbulent.&nbsp;</p> <p>My US trip is on indefinite hold. Thankfully my sister and her wife were able to exit the mounting health crisis engulfing their city and are expecting their baby here at home very soon.</p> <p>I\u2019m very lucky all my family is locked down within the same borders. Now I\u2019m thinking about that Canberra weekend, and a week sometime in the winter on the south coast, a road trip I know well from childhood. A change of scenery, a few games of Trivial Pursuit and bourbon poured just how I like it \u2013 hard to feel anything but extremely grateful for all that right now.<br></p>",

As the economy reopens and people return to work, person-to-person contact will increase and an already \u201cshocking number of infections and deaths among workers will rise,\u201d the union said.</p> <p>In its two-page ruling, the appeals court said OSHA is authorized to issue an emergency temporary standard, or ETS, if it determines that employees are exposed to grave danger from a new hazard in the workplace, and that an emergency rule is needed to protect them from that danger.</p> <p>The decision not to issue an ETS \u201cis entitled to considerable deference,\u2019\u2019 the court said.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the regulatory tools that the OSHA has at its disposal to ensure that employers are maintaining hazard-free work environments, OSHA reasonably determined that an ETS is not necessary at this time,\u2019\u2019 the ruling said.</p> <p>The ruling was signed by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao. Henderson and Rao were appointed by Republican presidents and Wilkins by a Democrat.</p> <p>The Labor Department said in a statement Thursday that officials were pleased at the ruling, which backed its contention that existing rules and regulations are protecting Americas workers and that an emergency temporary standard is not needed.</p> <p>\u201cOSHA will continue to enforce the law and offer guidance to employers and employees to keep Americas workplaces safe, said the statement, issued by Loren Sweatt, a top Labor Department official who oversees OSHA, and Kate OScannlain, the department\u2019s top lawyer.</p> <p>OSHA\u2019s performance came under fire at a contentious House hearing last month, in which Democrats accused the agency of being largely invisible during the pandemic.</p> <p>Instead of an emergency standard, OSHA has relied on voluntary guidance that recommends companies erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations, among other steps.</p> <p>But the guidance is not mandatory, and Covid-19 cases have spiked at meatpacking plants, prisons, nursing homes and other workplaces deemed essential during the pandemic.</p> <p>AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said he was disappointed that three federal judges \u201cdid not deem the lives of Americas workers worthy of holding an argument or issuing a full opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe post-it length response to the union\u2019s lawsuit acknowledges the unprecedented\u201d nature of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cbut repeats the false claim by Big Business that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration already has done what is needed to protect workers,\u2019\u2019 Trumka said in a statement.</p> <p>More than two million Americans have been infected with Covid-19, and more than 110,000 have died, according a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

Many people at protests were wearing masks and engaging in some social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the White House task force Pence chairs, has expressed concern about the protests taking place during the pandemic. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/california-coronavirus-cases-spikes-latest\">nine California counties have reported a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalizations</a>. New diagnoses are up partly due to more available testing, but loosening of restrictions and flouting of public health rules are also factors. </p> <p>Here are the other key developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Mexico City will embark on a large-scale testing effort as the centrepiece of its plan to reopen its economy,</strong> its mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said. The plan sees it diverge from the federal government\u2019s strategy, which has shunned widespread testing as a waste of resources. The goal will be performing about 100,000 tests per month by July and trying to detect and isolate new infections as quickly as possible, Sheinbaum said. The Associated Press reported that it would be paired with an intensive information campaign.</li> <li><strong>France saw a below-average increase in deaths.</strong> The death toll has risen by only 23 \u2013 well below the average daily increase of 53 seen over the last two weeks \u2013 to 29,319. That is the fifth-highest nominal total in the world.</li> <li><strong>Hollywood productions will be allowed to resume from Friday, local authorities said.</strong> While work could resume, cinemas must remain closed, California state officials said.</li> <li><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, has reported a record number of deaths for the second day running</strong> \u2013 even as its metropolis allowed shops to reopen. The centre of the Brazilian epidemic has recorded 340 new deaths in the last 24 hours, raising the state\u2019s confirmed death toll to 9,862, a fourth of the country\u2019s total fatalities, the governor\u2019s office said.</li> <li><strong>The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven into alleged errors made by authorities</strong>. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst-hit by the virus, will also question the health minister and the interior minister.</li> <li><strong>A US pharmaceutical company claimed a drug specifically designed to treat Covid-19 could be authorised for use as early as September.</strong> The chief scientist at Eli Lilly and Co told Reuters the feat could be achieved if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing.</li> <li><strong>Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cord</strong><strong>\u00f3</strong><strong>ba, </strong><strong>where he caught Covid-19</strong><strong>. </strong>Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cord\u00f3ba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants.<br></li> <li><strong>France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned</strong>, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown. Bruno Le Maire told a finance committee in parliament: \u201cOur evaluation is that 800,000 jobs will be lost in the coming months, or 2.8% of total employment.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years</strong>, a leading Russian radio station has reported, indicating that the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least two times higher than official tallies for the month.</li> <li><strong>The global economy will contract at least 6% this year</strong>, with the unprecedented loss of income and \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d caused by measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said.</li> <li><strong>Airlines are set to lose $84bn (\u00a365.9bn) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic</strong>, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecast. With most of the world\u2019s airliners currently parked, IATA said revenue would likely halve, falling from $419bn from $838bn last year.</li> <li><strong>China was accused of running disinformation campaigns inside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a></strong>, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the coronavirus.

  "<p>Local authorities have called on the government to suspend the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/home-offices-denial-of-benefits-to-migrant-families-unlawful-court-rules\">controversial \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d</a> immigration status for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, to prevent thousands from falling into destitution and homelessness.</p> <p>High numbers of people who have this status attached to their visas have been approaching councils for emergency assistance during the pandemic. Many are struggling to survive during the exceptional circumstances of lockdown, with no safety net, according to the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the UK have an immigration status that allows them to work here, but which prevents them from accessing most benefits should they become unemployed. Many have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic and are struggling to feed their families and pay rent. Many face losing their homes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/05/eviction-ban-extended-in-uk-by-further-two-months\">once restrictions on evictions are lifted</a>.</p> <p>Since March charities all over the country have been helping to feed families designated with this immigration status, after lockdown pushed them into unemployment. Homelessness charities have warned of the rise in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/london-coronavirus-sacked-hospitality-workers-sleeping-rough\"> homeless migrant workers</a> with the \u201cNRPF\u201d status \u2013 many of whom were working until lockdown in the restaurant and hotel industry, and have struggled to pay rents since losing their jobs. Although landlords are prevented from evicting tenants during lockdown, many who have informal tenancies have lost their homes anyway.</p> <p>Councils have been given special dispensation to house homeless migrants with this immigration status for the duration of the pandemic, but there is no longer-term provision to fund measures to stop people who were sleeping rough from returning to the streets once lockdown ends and hotels housing the homeless return to being used by tourists.</p> <p>The LGA has asked for greater clarity on how they can help people who are destitute and homeless because of their immigration status. A suspension of the NRPF condition would allow people to claim welfare benefits, which could stave off homelessness, it says.</p> <p>David Renard, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, said: \u201cCouncils have been doing everything they can to support all groups facing homelessness. Councils are now planning their next steps in supporting people to move on from emergency accommodation. A temporary removal of the NRPF condition would reduce public health risks and pressures on homelessness services by enabling vulnerable people to access welfare benefits.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d status was introduced in 2012 as one of a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment immigration measures</a>. Those policies have come under increasing scrutiny in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, which saw thousands of legal UK residents denied access to work, housing and healthcare.</p> <p>The LGA\u2019s call follows one from a consortium of more than 40 migrants\u2019 rights organisations to scrap the NRPF status permanently on the grounds that it \u201cbars most migrants from accessing a vast proportion of the social security net we all rely on in times of crisis\u201d. Those on this visa are barred from things such as universal credit, disability allowances, local authority homelessness support, free school meals and access to mainstream refuges for victims of domestic violence.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said more than \u00a33.2bn had been allocated to local authorities to help them deal with the unexpected costs of lockdown and \u00a3750m to charities to reach out and support the most vulnerable. The spokesperson added that many coronavirus measures were not considered public funds, so should be available to migrants with no recourse to public funds.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies with leave under family and human rights routes can apply, free of charge, to have no recourse to public funds conditions lifted and we encourage anyone eligible to submit an application. Government measures such as rent protections also apply to those with these conditions,\u201d they said.</p> <p>The Home Office was unable to say how many people had applied for this exemption, or how many had been granted it. Charities supporting people with this immigration status say getting the status lifted is extremely difficult.</p> <p>Sally Daghlian, chief executive of the migrant rights charity Praxis, which is backing the call and which has helped hundreds of families facing destitution during the pandemic, said: \u201cWe have seen parents going without food to try to ensure their children eat, and people facing homelessness and mounting debt. In the face of this pandemic, people with NRPF have not been supported through the government\u2019s Covid-19 safety net. If the government is committed to ending destitution, child poverty and homelessness, it should permanently suspend NRPF as a matter of urgency.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

When the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies discussed contact tracing in early May, according to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888807/S0402_Thirty-second_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19_.pdf\">the minutes (pdf)</a> \u201cit agreed that at least 80% of contacts of an index case would need to be contacted for a system to be effective.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But these figures don\u2019t tell the story. There are at least four potential drawbacks.</p> \n  <p><em><strong>1 - Positive cases never referred to the service</strong></em></p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891703/NHS_test_and_trace_bulletin__England__-_28_May_to_3_June_2020.pdf\">statistical bulletin (pdf)</a> from the Department of Health and Social Care says 8,117 people who tested positive between 28 May and 3 June were referred to the test and trace service for England. But these were probably only a small proportion of the new cases that week. According to <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/5june2020\">an ONS survey</a>, there were an estimated 39,000 new cases in England every week during May. Towards the end of the month the infection rate was falling, but these figures suggest thousands of cases are being missed by test and trace, largely because people are getting infected but not getting a test.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>2 - People who don\u2019t cooperate</em></strong></p> \n  <p>In his video message (in which he also says the system will get better over time), Hancock says that 85% \u201cof all those who needed to be contacted\u201d were contacted. That\u2019s misleading. Some 85% of the contacts who were actually identified - ie, people named as having been in close contact with someone who tested positive - were reached by the service and told to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>But only 67% of those who tested positive and whose names were passed on to the service provided names of their contacts. For the 33% who did not provide any names, for obvious reasons 0% of their contacts were contacted.</p> \n  <p>If 5,407 people testing positive provided the names of 31,794 contacts, then on average each Covid-positive person had 5.88 contacts who might be at risk. That means if there were 8,117 people testing positive being referred to the service, there were around 47,700 people in total who needed to be reached and told to self-isolate. In the event 31,794 people were contacted - a \u2018success rate\u2019 of 67%.</p> \n  <p>Arguably that\u2019s still quite reasonable for the first week, but it is well short of Sage\u2019s target of 80%.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>3 - People who don\u2019t cooperate on time</em></strong></p> \n  <p>The figure quoted above is based on the 67% of Covid-positive people referred to the service who did provide details of their contacts. But, as the statistical bulletin shows, only 79% of people provided details of their contacts within 24 hours. <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the chair of the Commons health committee, says that if you ignore the other 25% who took longer, you get a different success rate.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt/status/1271060790599200768\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On the face of it these are encouraging no.s.

But, in <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/06/why-i-broke-boris-johnson\">an article for the New Statesman</a>, he says he has lost faith in the prime minister because he now thinks the PM has given up listening to a wide range of voices and is now intolerant of criticism. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It took six years for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s governments to begin to stop listening to alternative voices. The same patterns had emerged within six months of Johnson becoming prime minister, and within six weeks of his general election victory last December. In her early years the Iron Lady relished argument and intellectual debate \u2013 and those internal jousts strengthened her for the public battles with her true opponents. In the starkest of contrasts, the team inside today\u2019s No 10 has often preferred to greet internal dissent with retribution \u2013 much of it pre-briefed to favoured journalists. Throughout the Westminster village every Tory had quickly learned the score: do, say and tweet as you are told \u2013 or else. In February\u2019s reshuffle we learned that earning the disfavour of key prime ministerial adviser Dominic Cummings was fatal, even if you were chancellor of the Exchequer. Everyone was dispensable. Except Dom.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview on the World at One, Montgomerie, who is particularly close to Sajid Javid, the former chancellor who was effectively sacked because he would not let No 10 choose his advisers, said he was especially worried about the influence of Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I worry about is that [Cummings] is a brilliant figure, but half of his ideas are crazy, and half of his ideas are good. He shouldn\u2019t be in a leadership position, he shouldn\u2019t be in a dominant position. And I\u2019m afraid that is what has happened inside Downing Street ... The Vote Leave operation that Dominic Cummings ran during the EU referendum has essentially been transplanted into Downing Street, and there is a lack of diversity in thought and personnel as a result.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6de455cf94a9cdd3a43f6c0b88820254b2b7a3fe\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6de455cf94a9cdd3a43f6c0b88820254b2b7a3fe/165_186_1723_1033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Montgomerie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Montgomerie.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Meddle/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T13:26:52.470Z\">at 2.26pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2277e8f089c0fbf3588f1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T12:47:57.456Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Probation services in England and Wales to be brought back into public ownership</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Probation services in England and Wales will be fully restored to public ownership and control, the justice secretary has announced, marking the final nail in the coffin of Chris Grayling\u2019s disastrous privatisation reforms.</p> \n  <p>Under Grayling\u2019s widely derided shake-up in 2014, the probation sector was separated into a public sector organisation, the National Probation Service (NPS) managing high-risk criminals and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders.</p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) previously announced that all offender management, around 80% of all probation work, would be brought under the state-run National Probation Service (NPS).</p> \n  <p>The remaining services, such as rehabilitation and the provision of unpaid work, will no longer be offered up for private tender, the justice secretary said, marking the complete return of probation services to the public sector.</p> \n  <p>Around 2,000 workers at the private providers, known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs), are to be brought over to HM Prison and Probation Service.</p> \n  <p><strong>Robert Buckland</strong> told the Commons: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The delivery of unpaid work, behavioural change programmes will be brought under control of the NPS alongside offender supervision when current CRC contracts end in June next year.</p> \n   <p>This will give us a critical measure of control, resilience and flexibility with these services which we would not have had were they delivered under 12 contracts with an umber of organisations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T13:49:06.816Z\">at 2.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2108c8f0880e1bd40304d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T12:41:47.375Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Much of the Downing Street lobby briefing was taken up with a discussion of the test and trace figures.

The SNP has actively been exploring the idea - <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland\u2019s first minister recently described it as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/universal-basic-income-ubi-scotland-uk-nicola-sturgeon-coronavirus-a9498076.html\">an idea whose time has come </a>- and the Scottish government had funded a modest pilot to examine the feasibility of the idea.</p> \n  <p>Its <a href=\"https://basicincome.scot/2020/06/10/draft-final-report-cbi-feasibility-study/\">final report</a> is now out. And the Scottish government has concluded that, although the idea is \u201cdesirable\u201d, it would be impossible to introduce one without the support of the UK government because of the way so much welfare and tax policy is still decided in London.</p> \n  <p><strong>Aileen Campbell,</strong> the Scottish government\u2019s communities secretary, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of the UK social security system and strengthened calls to further explore how a universal basic income could provide support to people and reduce poverty. We now have the perfect opportunity to take that forward.</p> \n   <p>The Scottish government agree with the report\u2019s conclusion that while introducing a basic income pilot is desirable, it can only be done with the full cooperation and collaboration of all relevant parties, particularly the UK government. That is why I have written to UK ministers urging them to engage constructively with us on this matter and discuss next steps towards a universal basic income pilot.</p> \n   <p>This is now the time to seriously consider a basic income pilot as part of a UK-wide Covid-19 programme of support to ensure a strong and fair economic and social recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The SNP\u2019s appeal to the UK government for help implementing a universal basic income is almost certainly doomed to failure. <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, the chancellor, has repeatedly said he is not in favour (eg<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46#block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46\"> here</a>).</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:16:41.317Z\">at 12.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee20e848f089c0fbf358766\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:03:30.356Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>After Boris Johnson yesterday said that all pupils would return to school in <strong>England</strong> after the summer holidays, one of the UK\u2019s main teachers\u2019 unions has issued what it calls a \u201cnational education recovery plan\u201d.<br><br>The prime minister said that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, will next week issue details of what he called \u201ca huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months\u201d.

The NEUs 10-point plan addresses significant issues that have to be considered.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we has actually peaked in infection rates before we went into lockdown, and that was therefore coming already down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he went on to allege that Ferguson and his epidemiological modelling was discredited. Duncan Smith said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think this piece of information comes from the man who ran the Imperial College model which has been now roundly trashed by almost every single scientist, particularly in Oxford and Edinburgh.

  "<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has urged China to step back from the brink by abandoning plans to impose new security laws on Hong Kong, as he accused Beijing of treating a member of Foreign Office staff in a way \u201camounting to torture\u201d.</p> <p>Raab attacked the Chinese government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/former-uk-official-simon-cheng-in-hong-kong-tortured-in-15-day-china-ordeal\">brutal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/former-uk-official-simon-cheng-in-hong-kong-tortured-in-15-day-china-ordeal\">treatment of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/former-uk-official-simon-cheng-in-hong-kong-tortured-in-15-day-china-ordeal\">Simon Cheng</a>, a former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong, who was kept in custody for 15 days after travelling to the mainland.</p> <p>Defending the UK\u2019s right to comment on Hong Kong by noting other countries have a right to hold Beijing to account if it does not uphold international treaties, Raab added: \u201cChina has not provided an adequate response on its undertaking to investigate Cheng\u2019s mistreatment.\u201d</p> <p>Urging the Chinese government not to interfere in elections for a new Hong Kong legislature due to be held in September, he said Beijing should stop using its economic power to try to influence business in the territory. Late last week HSBC bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/mike-pompeo-criticises-hsbc-for-corporate-kowtow-to-china-hong-kong\">announced its support of the new security laws</a>, an act described as \u201ccraven\u201d by the former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind.</p> <p>The warnings come in the latest six monthly report on Hong Kong submitted by Raab to the UK parliament. In some of the strongest language ever seen in the oftentimes bland reports, Raab warns the plans to impose new security laws bypassing the Hong Kong legislature are in direct conflict with international law.</p> <p>The Foreign Office is trying to build a diplomatic alliance against the security measures in an attempt to convince China that the reputational and economic price for going ahead with the new security laws is too high.</p> <p>Raab argues the way out of the impasse is for both sides to invest in dialogue and reconciliation, underpinned by a robust, independent inquiry into police repression of the protests.</p> <p>The six monthly report covers the period July to December 2019, encompassing some of the most violent of the wave of mass protests sparked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">a currently shelved extradition bill</a>.</p> <p>Raab directly warns China not to interfere in the Hong Kong legislature elections due to take place in September saying \u201cthey must be free, fair and without violence or intimidation\u201d. There is a concern that China will cancel the ballot fearing the pro-democracy movement will do too well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/25/a-tsunami-of-public-opinion-unexpected-winner-hails-hong-kong-voters\">District elections in November</a> saw a record turn-out and 57% of the vote going to pro-democracy candidates, a result described in the Foreign Office as a landslide.</p> <p>Raab says although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">the planned emergency security legislation </a>has yet to be published, the outline \u201craises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, which would undermine existing commitments to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cSuch legislation would be a clear violation of China\u2019s international obligations, including those made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposals also include provision for the authorities in Hong Kong to report back to Beijing on progress in pursuing national security education of its people, which is a sobering prospect.\u201d</p> <p>He also reiterates the promise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">British National Overseas passport holders will be entitled to a 12 months extendable visa opening a path to citizenship</a>.</p> <p>However, this offer is coming under increasing scrutiny from Hong Kong campaigners who are demanding to see the small print in order to assess its true value.</p> <p>Rifkind, speaking this week to the Henry Jackson Society, said: \u201cChina does have an Achilles heel when it comes to Hong Kong. If China pushes too far with what they are seeking to do, they will not absorb a prosperous significant financially important Hong Kong into the body of China. They will be left with a hollow shell.</p> <p>\u201cIf it ceases to be an enclave of freedom, many young Hongkongers, the brightest people in the world, will not live under Chinese totalitarian control, but leave \u2013 some to Britain and some to other countries. It will be a tragedy and to its permanent shame of having destroyed the freedoms of Hong Kong.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

Just fly!

Virgin, administration. Tiger, disappeared. Qantas, one flight a day.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first hurdle to cross: could I even leave Victoria?</p> <p>A quick check of the laws \u2013 and yes, I could leave. The borders between the states had never been closed.</p> <p>But looking at flights a few weeks before the event, I had a shock.&nbsp;The cheapest one-way direct flight leaving on the Friday was $800. The other flights, costing in their thousands and taking 23 hours and 50 minutes to get from Melbourne to Sydney, actually went via Perth.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-vacation-australian-family-recreate-15-hour-holiday-flight-in-living-room\">Coronavirus vacation: Australian family recreate 15-hour holiday flight in living room</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Could I even get into Perth with the borders closed or would I have to go into quarantine?</p> <p>As an unlicensed person, I couldn\u2019t drive to Sydney, and a quick search on the Greyhound website revealed they had suspended their Melbourne-Sydney bus services.</p> <p>Pre-Covid, moving between the two capitals had been so easy that a sort of magical thinking formed that really Melbourne and Sydney were only an hour apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>The virus \u2013 in the way that it operates on so many levels by unspooling time, taking us back to another age \u2013 meant that the trip would have to be taken an old-fashioned way. By rail.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shudder. The train. Maybe unfairly, the Melbourne to Sydney train has a grim reputation. Slow, overly long (at 11 hours and 17 minutes, making it longer than the Melbourne-Shanghai flight), uncomfortable, dull \u2013 it\u2019s never made the list of the world\u2019s great rail journeys.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRailways and ships are the two forms of travel where the journey is commensurately as exciting as the destination,\u201d wrote the late, great travel writer AA Gill, who obviously hadn\u2019t travelled on the line.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even train nerds are decidedly a bit cold on it. One colleague on secondment from England had been excited to take the journey between the capitals by rail. He couldn\u2019t understand why people kept urging him to fly instead, until he took the journey and realised it was slow and mostly boring.</p> <h2><strong>Preliminaries</strong></h2> <p>Southern Cross is bleak at 6am. The pandemic has emptied it of commuters, and at this hour it\u2019s not only eerie but very cold, and there\u2019s nothing open. The train leaves at 7am but I want to give myself time to check in \u2013 just like I would at an airport.</p> <p>But when I try to find the Sydney train on the departures board, it\u2019s not there! Have I got the day wrong? No. The time? My ticket says 7am.&nbsp;</p> <p>I got to a Vline counter and they laugh. They literally laugh in my face \u2013 not in an unkind way, but at my expectation the Sydney train would conform to a timetable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c787bc2320d89f3ebcd089f25817f0540d08ab2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c787bc2320d89f3ebcd089f25817f0540d08ab2/0_409_1400_1174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The room called \u201cTravellers Aid\u201d, in a socially distanced configuration.

I sit in a room called \u201cTravellers Aid\u201d, in a socially distanced configuration. It\u2019s like a grim, 1980s version of an airport lounge. There are heaters and showers and a television showing the ABC breakfast show \u2013 but nowhere to charge your phone and no wifi.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then finally, a departure announcement. People on the platform, socially distanced, wearing masks, are carrying bags and bags of food.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s alarming.

Additionally, the administration declared on Thursday that it was launching a counter-investigation into the ICC, for alleged corruption.</p> <p>The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, defence secretary, Mark Esper and attorney general, William Barr, gave a presentation on the decision at the state department, but then left without taking any questions.</p> <p>Barr made clear that this was the beginning of a sustained campaign against the ICC, and that Thursday\u2019s measures were just an \u201cimportant first step in holding the ICC accountable for exceeding its mandate and violating the sovereignty of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe US government has reason to doubt the honesty of the ICC. The Department of Justice has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor,\u201d Barr said.</p> <p>He referred to the ICC as \u201clittle more than a political tool employed by unaccountable international elites\u201d.</p> <p>The ICC responded on Thursday night with a statement expressing \u201cprofound regret at the announcement of further threats and coercive actions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese attacks constitute an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the Court\u2019s judicial proceedings,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey are announced with the declared aim of influencing the actions of ICC officials in the context of the court\u2019s independent and objective investigations and impartial judicial proceedings.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>An attack on the ICC also represents an attack against the interests of victims of atrocity crimes, for many of whom the Court represents the last hope for justice.</p> <p>Judges at the ICC gave the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/05/icc-greenlights-afghanistan-investigation\">green light in March</a> to an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, and began an investigation into crimes by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/20/icc-to-investigate-alleged-israeli-and-palestinian-war-crimes\">Israeli and Palestinian forces </a>in December.

The executive order clearly allows for sanctions against ICC personnel who investigate US allies who have not consented to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</p> <p>Bosco, an associate professor at Indiana University, added: \u201cThe actual effect on the court\u2019s Afghanistan investigation will probably not be significant.

  "<p><strong>India</strong> reported almost 10,000 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, with hospitals swamped in the worst-hit cities of Mumbai, New Delhi and Chennai, and predictions that the infection rate will not peak before the end of next month.</p> <p>The country of 1.3bn people now has the fifth highest number of confirmed cases in the world, at 286,579. Over the last 24 hours 357 people have died from the virus, bringing the official toll to 8,102.</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said the situation globally was deteriorating, at a time when Europe appears to be over the worst of the pandemic. More than 100,000 new cases worldwide were reported each day for most of the last two weeks, WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.</p> <p>Nearly 75% of these cases came from just 10 countries, including India, the rest of <strong>South Asia</strong> and <strong>the Americas</strong>, Tedros added. The <strong>US</strong> clocked up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/us-covid-19-cases-2-million\">2m positive </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/us-covid-19-cases-2-million\">tests </a>while <strong>Russia </strong>passed the half a million figure. There was also a small but \u201csteady increase\u201d of infections in Africa, he said.</p> <p>So far <strong>Africa </strong>has mostly avoided the kind of rampant outbreak seen in Europe and the US. Matshidiso Moeti, the UN health agency\u2019s Africa regional director, said there were 207,617 cases across 54 countries and 5,642 deaths. Hotspots include <strong>South Africa,</strong> <strong>Algeria</strong> and <strong>Cameroon</strong>.</p> <p>\u201cEven though these cases in Africa account for less than 3% of the global total, it\u2019s clear that the pandemic is accelerating,\u201d Moeti said. \u201cWe believe that large numbers of severe cases and deaths are not being missed in Africa.\u201d</p> <p>It is India which appears poised for a calamitous jump in infections, especially in the financial capital <strong>Mumbai </strong>and the state of <strong>Maharashtra</strong>. After two months of lockdown the government of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, is now relaxing measures.</p> <p>Restaurants, shopping malls and places of worship in much of India are reopening and travel is gradually restarting. The easing of restrictions is driven by economic factors. Millions of migrant labourers thrown out of work by quarantine measures are unable to feed their families.</p> <p>In New Delhi, the situation is particularly dire. The city government this week predicted the caseload would increase 20 times to more than half a million by the end of July. The healthcare system seems woefully ill-prepared and unequal to the multiplying problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when this is going to peak,\u201d Dr Deven Juneja told AFP during a pause in his rounds at Delhi\u2019s Max private hospital. \u201cAll of us are hoping for the best, but we are mentally and physically prepared for the worst.\u201d</p> <p>Juneja said the surge had started to be felt over the past few days, with an increase in the number of people looking for a bed. \u201cThat has definitely increased the load on us. We want to get our patients well as soon as possible and try to create more beds for our patients,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Vinita Thakur, a nurse in a Covid-19 ward, said wearing protective suits for long hours in the hot Indian summer required \u201cphysical and mental courage\u201d. \u201cAfter putting on the PPE we can\u2019t drink water, can\u2019t eat, can\u2019t even go to the washroom,\u201d Thakur said. \u201cBut we have to do it. We are on the frontline.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in <strong>Germany</strong>, the number of active Covid-19 cases has gone up to 5,460 \u2013 the&nbsp;first rise in total cases in two months. On Thursday, health authorities announced 555 new infections. Some 8,755 people have died of the virus in Germany so far, with a day-on-day rise of 26.</p> <p>The uptick received relatively little attention as several of Germany\u2019s 16&nbsp;<em>L\u00e4nder</em>, or federal states, took further steps towards relaxing physical distancing restrictions. In the eastern state of Thuringia, distancing measures will be scrapped altogether from Saturday, though the wearing of masks in shops and on public transport remains mandatory.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, <strong>Finland</strong> said it would reopen its borders to tourists from neighbouring Baltic and Nordic countries, excluding Sweden, from 15 June. <strong>Denmark</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong> have made a similar move and have kept Sweden out of their new travel arrangements because of its rate of infection.</p> <p>Finnish borders are due to open to tourists from Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 15 June. Tourists from other EU countries may be able to visit after 14 July.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Latin America</strong> has passed 70,000 deaths, as <strong>Mexico</strong> hit a daily record for confirmed infections. <strong>Brazil</strong>, with the largest economy in the region, remains the region\u2019s most affected country.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Cuba</strong> will test all visitors for coronavirus when it reopens to international tourism, which will be limited at first to the beach resorts on the Caribbean\u2019s largest island, the prime minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz, has said.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>New cases are on the rise in the <strong>Balkans</strong>, leading officials in&nbsp;<strong>Bosnia</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>North Macedonia</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Albania</strong>&nbsp;to appeal to citizens to respect public health advice.

  "<p>Shamima Begum, the woman who left Britain as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State, cannot effectively challenge the government\u2019s decision to deprive her of British citizenship while she is in a detention camp in northern Syria, the court of appeal has been told.</p> <p>At the start of a two-day online hearing, her lawyers challenged a ruling by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) this year that she has not been rendered stateless because she is entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship.</p> <p>Begum, now 20, was one of three east London schoolgirls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/fears-london-schoolgirls-isis-syria\">who travelled to Syria to join </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/fears-london-schoolgirls-isis-syria\">Isis in February 2015</a>.

She was nine months pregnant and said she wanted to return to the UK; shortly afterwards she gave birth. That month the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, informed her family that her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/isis-briton-shamima-begum-to-have-uk-citizenship-revoked\">British citizenship was being revoked</a>. In March her baby son, Jarrah, died.</p> <p>After being moved to al-Roj, another camp in northern Syria, Begum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/20/shamima-begum-family-challenge-sajid-javid-over-citizenship-decision\">initiated legal action</a> remotely at the high court against the Home Office and against the decision of Siac, which hears challenges to decisions to remove British citizenship on national security grounds.</p> <p>Opening her case, Tom Hickman QC said the key issue was whether the absence of \u201ca fair or effective means of challenging the decision to deprive her of her British citizenship\u201d made the decision unlawful.</p> <p>He said the case breached \u201cnatural justice\u201d as her appeal \u201ccannot be pursued in a manner that satisfies even minimum requirements of fair procedure\u201d.</p> <p>Hickman said Begum\u2019s case was \u201cthe first case in which Siac has held that an appellant cannot have a fair and effective appeal\u201d.</p> <p>The human rights organisation Liberty has intervened in her case to \u201cuphold the right to a fair trial in the increasing use of \u2018citizenship stripping\u2019 by the Home Office\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement released outside the court, Katie Lines, a lawyer with Liberty, said: \u201cBanishing someone is not the act of a responsible government \u2026 [It] has other powers at its disposal, including criminal law, which it can and should use to deal with those suspected of terrorism.</p> <p>\u201cDue process and the right to a fair trial is not a privilege to be handed out when the government sees fit. Ensuring we are all equal before the law is a principle that protects all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Sir James Eadie QC, representing the Home Office, said in written submissions: \u201cThe fact that the appellant could not fully engage with the statutory appeal procedure was a result of her decision to leave the UK, travel to Syria against Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice and align with [Isis].</p> <p>\u201cThis led to her being held in conditions akin to detention in a foreign state at the hands of a third party, the Syrian Defence Force. It was not the result of any action by the [home secretary].\u201d</p> <p>Eadie added that Begum had been able to speak to her lawyers, and argued that \u201cthe fact that it might not be possible to mirror the level of access to legal advice that would be available if someone were at liberty in the UK does not mean the proceedings are unfair\u201d.</p> <p>The hearing continues. The judges are expected to reserve their decision to a later date.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>IT\u2019S IN THE GAME</strong></h2> \n<p>Last weekend, television coverage of the Bundesliga was enhanced by artificial crowd noise that drowned out the squeaky-trainers-in-school-hall soundtrack for a more satisfactory ambience. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it proved an artistic decision that pleased everyone, one way or another: either an aural comfort blanket during unsettling times and a baby step back towards reality, or an opportunity for an iconoclastic hot whine on the old social media disgrace. Thank you, TV sorcerers! What would supporters worldwide, and indeed your severely uninspired Fiver, do without you?</p> \n<p>They\u2019re taking things up a notch on Thursday evening in Spain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/10/la-liga-restart-preview-silent-seville-derby-kicks-off-spains-new-normal\">as La Liga returns</a> with the&nbsp;<em>Gran Derbi</em>&nbsp;between Sevilla and Real Betis. In normal times, the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n would be filled with over 42,000 excited Andalusians hoping to attain local bragging rights, or at the very least witness a bench-emptying 40-man stramash. But as we\u2019ve known for the best part of 20 years now, these are not normal times. And so top video-game manufacturer EA Sports and some company or other called Vizrt have been drafted in to whip up a delicious computerised lie for the duration of the upcoming 40-day, 110-game festival o\u2019futbol. 1 UP! Ready!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/10/la-liga-restart-preview-silent-seville-derby-kicks-off-spains-new-normal\">La Liga restart preview: silent Seville derby kicks off Spain's new normal | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This Vizrt lot are in charge of virtually repopulating stadia across the land, filling them with images of fans in home-team colours. The Fiver was sorely disappointed to discover that they\u2019re not the digital arm of a certain Newcastle-based periodical, but a collective of Norwegian whizz-kids who produce real-time digital content. Bah. Our dream firm of Biffa Bacon, Paul Whicker the Tall Vicar, Skinheed, Roger Mellie, Rude Kid and Mrs Maybee and her Crazy Baby will remain unrealised for a while yet.</p> \n<p>As for sonics, the folk behind the Fifa games will plunder their files for some bespoke singing and chanting. Now, none of this is the same as 40,000-odd real people in situ giving it plenty, of course it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s better than sterile silence. And at least the computer-game programmers that football has been forced to go cap-in-hand to are technologically advanced enough to deliver a passable simulacrum of real life.

  "<p>Rohingya leaders have urged Bangladesh to lift an internet ban imposed on a million refugees in the city of Cox\u2019s Bazar, warning that rumours and panic over Covid-19 is deterring people from getting tested.</p> <p>Limits on communication are exacerbating already dire conditions for the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, who live in cramped bamboo huts with as many as eight family members to a room, and are dependent on communal taps and toilets.

As of 10 June, 35 refugees have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization, while three have died. In total, 30 are in quarantine, though it is feared that there are more undetected cases.</p> <p>The outbreak has coincided with flu season, adding to confusion over symptoms, but community members say that people are avoiding going to clinics because they are worried about being moved to isolation facilities.</p> <p>Last week, two people fled quarantine because they believed they would be sent to centres far from their families, according to reports.</p> <p>Many of the Rohingya refugees sheltering in Cox\u2019s Bazar fled to Bangladesh in 2017, following a military crackdown in Myanmar on its minority Muslim population, which the UN has since said was carried out with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/27/myanmars-military-accused-of-genocide-by-damning-un-report\">\u201cgenocidal intent\u201d</a>.&nbsp;After three years in the camps, with people unable to access education or build livelihoods, conditions have become increasingly desperate. Since the start of the year, many have attempted to flee Cox\u2019s Bazar by embarking on dangerous boat journeys to Malaysia, 1,000 miles away. They have then been left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/17/malaysia-and-thailand-urged-to-help-stranded-rohingya-refugees\">stranded at sea</a> for months as countries respond to the coronavirus pandemic by tightening their borders.&nbsp;</p> <p>This week, 270 refugees were detained by Malaysia after their damaged trawler was intercepted by the country\u2019s coastguard.</p> <p>Separately, another boat carrying hundreds of refugees from Cox\u2019s Bazar was recently intercepted by Bangladesh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/bangladesh-takes-rohingya-refugees-to-de-facto-detention-island\">escorted to Bhasan Char,</a> a remote silt island, apparently to reduce the risk of bringing the virus into Cox\u2019s Bazar. Some refugees fear they could face the same fate, though the UN\u2019s refugee agency said that 200 beds in severe respiratory infection isolation and treatment centres were available, and that hundreds more were being established.</p> <p>Mohammad Shaiful, 25, who lives with his wife, uncle and one-year-old daughter, said misinformation spread quickly in the camp. \u201cThere\u2019s a rumour that people will be killed in quarantine,\u201d he explained. \u201cLike doctors are injecting them with something that\u2019s causing the deaths. Also, doctors are \u2018giving\u2019 coronavirus to people who don\u2019t even have it and killing them.&nbsp;People tend to believe those rumours rather than putting some sense into it.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Refugees are being urged to maintain good hygiene and physical distancing but at the same time aid work has been cut to reduce the risk of transmission. Though essential services such as food and sanitation are continuing, one community leader said that in his area toilets had become unusable because they were not being maintained.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, we are not practising hand washing and maintaining sanitation because the particular NGOs who are responsible for hand washing and hygiene and sanitation, they are not coming in the camp,\u201d said Mohammad Jaffa, a community leader in camp 7 of Cox\u2019s Bazar.</p> <p>Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, said that the Rohingya were grateful to Bangladesh for hosting them in Cox\u2019s Bazar, but that internet services should be switched on so that people could receive news and reliable information about the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t follow what\u2019s happening in the world and how many people have died. They need to know what is happening with Covid-19 so they can learn from that and see how it is a danger to the whole community,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Bangladeshi government has repeatedly stated that it is doing far more than other countries to support the Rohingya, and says that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/05/bangladesh-imposes-mobile-phone-blackout-in-rohingya-refugee-camps\">internet ban</a> has been imposed for security reasons.</p> <p>Markets and shops were closed, said Abu Tahir, 37, who lives with his wife and three children, but people could not stay isolated inside tiny rooms all day.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen if I test positive for Covid. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about this quarantine thing. If anything\u2019s to happen to me, I\u2019d like to have my children and loved ones around me. And they say there\u2019s no treatment for this disease, then what\u2019s the point of isolating?</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already been through a lot. But we survived because the Almighty has a soft corner for us. He\u2019ll take care of us.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A high-court judge has ordered the Home Office to pay for a hotel for a vulnerable asylum seeker and her two young children, after twice placing them in unsafe accommodation over the past 10 months.</p> <p>The woman and her two children aged eight and nine were placed in Home Office accommodation last August, but made repeated complaints about the conditions. Concerns were raised about the risk to the woman and her children of remaining in that accommodation by the children\u2019s school, social services, lawyers and charities.</p> <p>After almost 10 months they were finally moved last Friday to a dirty, insect-infested hotel in east London where, the woman told the Guardian, physical distancing was impossible and she witnessed prostitution.</p> <p>In an emergency high-court Skype hearing on Wednesday Mr Justice Choudhury ordered the Home Office to pay for a hotel close to the children\u2019s school which is clean and safe until more suitable long-term accommodation in the area can be found.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s barrister, Raza Halim, told the high court: \u201cThis hotel is not fit for habitation, let alone during a pandemic. There is prostitution there in plain sight.\u201d</p> <p>Home Office barrister Zane Malik told the court that the government was unable to find the family alternative accommodation in east London and wanted to move the family to Plymouth. He said that the hotel the family had been placed in complied with Public Health England guidelines.</p> <p>The judge rejected the Home Office\u2019s plan to uproot the children from their school and move the family to Plymouth and said in his judgment the accommodation provided was not suitable and that the evidence provided by the mother about the poor conditions in the hotel the Home Office moved the family to last Friday seemed credible and reliable.</p> <p>Of the children, the judge said: \u201cThis is a delicate stage for them and any serious disruption could have a long-term deleterious effect on their mental and physical health.\u201d</p> <p>It is highly unusual for an individual asylum seeker\u2019s accommodation problems to go all the way to the high court and for a judge to make an order of this kind.</p> <p>Figures provided to the Home Affairs Select Committee by the Home Office\u2019s three accommodation providers reveal that 2,660 asylum seekers are still sharing rooms during the pandemic and that although tens of thousands are in Home Office accommodation only 43 people have accessed Covid-19 tests.</p> <p>The woman and her children are of Uighur origin. Last August the Home Office put her and her children in unsuitable, overcrowded accommodation with another mother and her three children.</p> <p>She complained about a catalogue of incidents including the other mother barring her children from using the one toilet in the accommodation before they went to school in the mornings, assaulting one of the children with a metal rod, breaking the woman\u2019s kitchen utensils and pouring foul smelling liquid over the family. She found two dead rats in the family\u2019s bedroom. It took almost 10 months for the family to be moved to new accommodation.</p> <p>Evidence from the children\u2019s school said that despite the fact that the children had not been in the country for long they had settled in well at school, were \u201cmodel students\u201d and that the speed with which they had learnt English was \u201cremarkable\u201d.</p> <p>The children are continuing to attend school during the pandemic due to their vulnerability.</p> <p>Maria Thomas of Duncan Lewis solicitors, representing the woman and her two children, said: \u201cOur client was subjected to harassment, racist abuse and overcrowding. Despite her pleas for help the home secretary did nothing to resolve this and placed her and her children in a hotel which was unhygienic, unsafe and failed to comply with the government\u2019s guidelines for social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on legal proceedings, but we take the wellbeing of those in asylum accommodation extremely seriously, and if an individual has concerns about their accommodation or the service provided, they can raise the matter with Migrant Help or the Home Office, and we will take appropriate action.&nbsp;We are monitoring providers closely and will take swift action to address concerns where they are raised.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A young man who was given permission to stay in the UK after fleeing Gaza has been on hunger strike for more than 90 days in protest at what he sees as the \u201ctheft\u201d of his true identity on his official records.</p> <p>The man, who has learning disabilities and post-traumatic stress disorder, says he was wrongly assessed as being five years older than he is when he arrived in the UK. He regards his date of birth as a crucial part of his identity and a vital link to his late parents.</p> <p>Appeals have been made to the Home Office by his foster family and the <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\">mental health charity Mind</a>, who say changing his age will have no impact on his immigration status or give him any legal or financial advantage but will potentially save his life.</p> <p>But the Home Office says it cannot change a person\u2019s details without proof and it is worried that if it did so it would set a difficult precedent.</p> <p>The man, identified only as Mr A, arrived in the UK as a teenager seeking asylum, having fled Gaza where he says he was tortured.</p> <p>He had no original birth certificate, and an age assessment carried out by a local authority concluded he was 19. He maintained he was 14 and when he started school he was placed in year 10 with children of that age.</p> <p>Mr A was granted leave to remain in the UK in 2019 and asked for his records to accurately reflect his real birth date, but this has not happened.</p> <p>Mind has written to the Home Office asking it to change his official records. It said the only difference it would make was that he would have to wait longer to qualify for a state pension.</p> <p>His foster mother, Patsy Davis, from Bristol, told the Guardian that Mr A was desperately ill in hospital and doctors had said he may have only days to live. She said she was sure he was 14 when he came to live with her.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a big difference between a 14-year-old and a 19-year-old. He liked cartoons and children\u2019s programmes, he was stroppy at times, he didn\u2019t keep his bedroom tidy and needed support with his organisational skills. Just typical teenage behaviour,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The man, who says he is now 25, is in hospital in Bristol where his medical team have described his hunger strike as a form of suicide attempt.</p> <p>Davis said: \u201cThe age assessment itself was distressing for him, and since then he has been confronted with the date of birth almost weekly. He\u2019s lost a lot of hair because of the stress, and has needed counselling. It feels like the theft of his identity to him.</p> <p>\u201cHe is such a kind soul. He is very protective of us. I just feel that all the hard work to stabilise him has all been undone in the stroke of a pen.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Farmer, the chief executive of Mind, wrote to the Home Office: \u201cHis date of birth is part of his identity as it is with all of us, but that sense of identity is overlaid with the most traumatic of experiences: loss of country, parents and being subject to torture and multiple mental disorders. Any further loss of identity, such as the day you were born, can therefore become catastrophic to the sense of self.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Hore, the director at Bristol Mind, said: \u201cFor the sake of just a few digits, a man\u2019s life could be saved.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we do not routinely comment on individual cases, we handle complex cases as sensitively as possible. If new information or evidence comes to light we remain fully open to reviewing previous decisions on someone\u2019s age.\u201d</p> <p>Where there is doubt about someone\u2019s age and there is no documentary evidence of their age, the Home Office will refer them to a local authority for a social worker-led age assessment, known as a Merton compliant age assessment.<br></p>",
  "<p>My friend <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910807/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\">Willy Wands</a>, who has died aged 67 of pancreatic cancer, was, over four decades, the producer of a number of films, including, in recent years, The Gentlemen (2019), Whisky Galore! (2016) and Half of a Yellow Sun (2013), as well as many television series, including The Loch (2017), Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&nbsp;(2015) and The Field of Blood (2011).</p> <p>Many of the films he worked on were set in Scotland, or had a Scottish theme, and he was a passionate advocate for the film-making and television industry in his home country.</p> <p>Born in Maybole, Ayrshire, he was the son of George Wands, an aircraft production manager, and Jean (nee Allan), an office clerk. They named him Alan, but he was nicknamed Willy by his grandfather. He attended Carrick academy in South Ayrshire and left at 15 to become an apprentice electrician on building sites. In 1975, however, he switched to being a lighting technician in theatre, first at<strong> </strong>the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts in Glasgow and then at Rada.</p> <p>Eventually Willy became production manager at the Ayr-based <a href=\"https://www.borderlinetheatre.co.uk/\">Borderline touring theatre</a>, for whom he also directed some shows, including The Threepenny Opera, which opened at the Edinburgh festival fringe before touring Scotland in 1981. Two years later he was asked to work at the art department buyer on Bill Forsyth\u2019s Comfort and Joy (1984), a film about Glasgow\u2019s ice cream wars. This led to work on Channel 4 films as he progressed through numerous production roles, working variously as location manager, first assistant director, production manager and line producer<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Based mainly in Glasgow or London, his career then began to encompass commercials, television drama, and domestic and international features. </p> <p>His first move into producing was as associate producer of the 1985 Cary Parker film The Girl in the Picture, set in Glasgow, and over the following years he was, among other things, associate producer of Shuttlecock (1993), executive producer of East Is East (1999), producer of Beautiful Creatures (2000) and producer of the TV movie Missing (2006). </p> <p>Willy was welcomed and befriended by crew and cast wherever he went; he could make people laugh even in the direst of circumstances, had great dynamism, and his generosity of spirit and professionalism made him an ambassador both for Scotland and Britain. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Julia (nee Calton), whom he married in 1986, and their daughters, Ola and Georgia. </p>",
  "<p>Hong Kong\u2019s security chief has announced that a dedicated police unit is being set up and would be ready to enforce controversial new national security laws from day one.</p> <p>There is widespread international and commercial concern about the impact of the laws that are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">being imposed on the semi-autonomous region</a> directly by Beijing, bypassing Hong Kong\u2019s legislature.

So they will let us know the whole picture when we, as a city, may not be able to just using our information.\u201d</p> <p>The Global Times reported the new Hong Kong force would work with mainland agencies on joint operations.</p> <p>The laws have fuelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-to-propose-controversial-hong-kong-security-measure\">international</a> and business concern over Beijing\u2019s growing interference with Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedoms.</p> <p>The laws are the latest in a string of significant economically destabilising events in Hong Kong, and there is widespread concern of an exodus of international corporations. A year of protests, the US-China trade war, and large-scale shutdowns due to the pandemic have had a significant impact on businesses.</p> <p>\u201cWe just can\u2019t seem to catch a break and things are ratcheting up,\u201d said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. \u201cHong Kong is a really valuable place for people both business-wise and personally. Nobody wants to run for the exit or throw the baby out with the bath water.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph said there was little detail coming forward about the laws, or about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/hong-kong-officials-lash-out-at-trump-plan-to-strip-city-of-special-status\">the US government\u2019s increasingly provocative plans</a> for its responses to Hong Kong and China.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very fluid situation and lots of unanswered questions and that\u2019s worrying because everyone\u2019s trying to figure out how hard the security laws are going to be, and how difficult the changes that the US may put out there will be,\u201d said Joseph.</p> <p>A survey of its members this month found 82% had held regular headquarter-level discussions on crisis management, on how to help staff cope with social division and distress, and on strategy adjustments. Almost one quarter were considering scaling back operations or moving out of Hong Kong.</p>",

  "<h2>Imagine</h2> <p>Over these past 11 weeks of lockdown, I have become intimately familiar with the cracked white walls of my flat, stained by remnants of Blu Tack and decked with hastily pasted posters and photo frames. Like any committed TV watcher, the centre of my living space is my television \u2013&nbsp;the welcome object of my focus away from plates piling up in the sink. Once I had rinsed through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/09/the-last-dance-michael-jordan-netflix\">The Last Dance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/normal-people-review-sally-rooney-bbc-hulu\">Normal People</a>, Tiger King and the rest, though, I found myself gravitating to an escapism of a different, more aesthetic kind.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b007ght1/imagine\">Alan Yentob\u2019s Imagine series</a> seems like a daunting undertaking at first glance: hour-long, ponderous documentaries on the biggest personalities in the arts, from Jeff Koons to Marlon Brando and Doris Lessing. It even stretches to the concept of the internet. There are three episodes from its 17-year archive currently on BBC iPlayer \u2013&nbsp;on Lenny Henry, Anish Kapoor and Howard Hodgkin \u2013 and they have become unexpected highlights of my current viewing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c23f67ca39909bf1ee002393ba06f1149d0ffff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c23f67ca39909bf1ee002393ba06f1149d0ffff/0_7_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A reminder of the vibrant creativity that exists around us\u2019 ...

Lenny Henry and Imagine\u2019s Alan Yentob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loriam Reed-Drake/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yentob is a reassuringly calm presence, forever hunched and trailing behind his interviewees, asking suitably vague questions about the meaning and allure of works, while glimpses of Kapoor\u2019s luridly bright sculptures, Henry\u2019s booming laugh, and Hodgkin\u2019s swirling colourscapes have provided much-needed reminders of all the vibrant creativity that exists around us. Hopefully, it is something we will be able to enjoy for real again once we emerge back into some semblance of normality.&nbsp;If nothing else, the programmes have at least inspired me to decorate my flat a little better. <em>Ammar Kalia</em></p> <h2>Devs</h2> <p>Whenever I hear tech bros talk on TV shows, the phrase \u201chacking the mainframe\u201d starts running ticker-tape-style through my brain, drowning out all the actual dialogue. Which is why <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087gj19\">Devs (BBC iPlayer/FX)</a> \u2013 the Silicon Valley-set thriller from Alex Garland (The Beach, Ex Machina) \u2013 wasn\u2019t exactly something I was prepared to clear my schedule for. What I was willing to do was vaguely overhear bits of it as my partner watched in the proper manner \u2013 a style of viewing that meant it took an inordinately long time for me to realise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/05/devs-tv-review-alex-garland\">Devs is less about big computers</a> and more about the big questions.</p> <p>What begins as a whodunnit set amid the shadowy goings-on at Amaya, a technology firm led by a Charles Manson lookalike called Forest (Parks and Rec\u2019s Nick Offerman), swiftly morphs into a) a rough guide to quantum physics, and b) a discussion of determinism so involving it will recolour your entire worldview. Devs does for free will what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/15/inception-review\">Inception did for lucid dreaming</a> and The Truman Show did for your life being a morally dubious reality-TV experiment.</p> <p>It may have taken me a while to get on board, but I won\u2019t forget this stylish, heartrending and compelling show in a hurry. <em>Rachel Aroesti</em></p> <h2>Classic soaps</h2> <p>With lockdown shutting down soap filming and the nation\u2019s favourite serials reduced to a few showings a week, I have found a solution: watching old soap episodes <a href=\"https://www.britbox.co.uk/\">on BritBox</a>.

Unlike every other programme that gets frequently reshown, soaps are one-offs, producing some of the biggest moments on British TV, never be shown again.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/04/coronation-street-50-years\">Richard Hillman driving the Platts into the canal</a>&nbsp;isn\u2019t the sort of thing made to only be watched once.&nbsp;<br><br>My only complaint is that the EastEnders archive is worryingly sparse. Where is the Max and Stacey videotape reveal, or Sharongate\u2019?&nbsp;Don\u2019t hold out on me now, BBC.&nbsp;<em>Frances Ryan</em></p> <h2>Strong</h2> <p>Many people have unlocked unknown physical potential by working out during lockdown.

Time, then, to participate in vigorous exercise the best way I know, by watching <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81031355#:~:text=Strong,with%2010%20elite%20personal%20trainers.\">other people do it</a><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81031355#:~:text=Strong,with%2010%20elite%20personal%20trainers.\"> in leotards</a><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81031355#:~:text=Strong,with%2010%20elite%20personal%20trainers.\"> on Netflix</a>. I enjoy Ultimate Beastmaster, in which international gym bunnies represent their countries on a big obstacle course, and I\u2019m pumped to watch The Titan Games, which dropped on Netflix last week, is fronted by Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, and features ordinary American heroes \u2013 ripped nurses, buff teachers, jacked single dads \u2013 facing off in Gladiators-style contests. <br><br>My favourite vicarious isolation workout, however, is Strong, a febrile hybrid of Ninja Warrior and The Biggest Loser. American women who are unhappy with their size are paired with superfit male personal trainers: elimination looms for the duo who come last in the punishing challenges. Before long, the participants are crying, bitching and hysterically competitive \u2013 and that\u2019s just the men! (This is not a joke. There\u2019s a nominations system to encourage backstabbing, and the guys really get into it.)</p> <p>Strong is tawdry, bewildering and, in its explicit association between body confidence and traversing monkey bars under the tutelage of a man called Todd or Ky, guilty of setting unrealistic wellness goals. But it\u2019s addictive, and is now a key part of my regime. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Glow Up</h2> <p>There were signs, I suppose. An (entirely healthy) obsession with Drag Race. An (entirely unhealthy) obsession with Skin Wars and its bizarre world of competitive body painting. But eight weeks ago I would have been more inclined to believe that driving 30 miles with your child in the back of your car was a government-approved eye test than I would that I\u2019d have binged an entire series of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p071fs3c\">Glow Up: Britain\u2019s Next Make-Up Star (iPlayer)</a> in a few days.

So it\u2019s safe to say that a drama about the triumphs, trials and tribulations of a Texas high school football team didn\u2019t immediately appeal.<br><br>But I had heard so many good things about Friday Night Lights (Amazon) that I decided to give it a go. And my oh my, it\u2019s the best choice I\u2019ve made all lockdown. It\u2019s a brilliant combination of emotional rollercoaster and profound social commentary on the racism, deprivation and religious conservatism that are endemic in the US south. I have never cared about TV characters like I\u2019ve cared about the folk of Dillon, Texas \u2013 and that\u2019s only partly because I\u2019ve been hanging out with them more than with my mates. As a motto to live by, you can\u2019t do better than: \u201cWhat would Coach T do?\u201d To have a marriage like his and Tami\u2019s has to be the ultimate relationship goal.</p> <p>I\u2019m so obsessed that I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad thinking how gutted the Panthers team would have been had the season been called off because of coronavirus, and I find the thought of it being over so horrifying that I\u2019m saving the last eight episodes, maybe for ever.

Cut to 2018, and Fisk, nearly 40 years older, hair a little thinner, glasses a little less clunky, is walking through almost identical ruined streets, this time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/12/homs-syria-residents\">Homs, Syria</a>.&nbsp;After a lifetime reporting on conflict, Fisk reflects on the capacity of human beings to&nbsp;cause chaos on such a scale.&nbsp;Is there something deep in our souls that permits it because it&nbsp;feels natural? His painful, deeply serious question about the inevitability of war sets the tone of this documentary about his career, directed by Yung Chang. Fisk is defiant against his critics, yet a kind of Graham Greene-like&nbsp;weariness seems to creep in at times.

  "<p>Treasure hunters have reacted with shock, delight and disbelief to the news that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/forrest-fenn-treasure-rocky-mountains-found\">chest containing gems, gold</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/forrest-fenn-treasure-rocky-mountains-found\"> and antiques worth up to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/forrest-fenn-treasure-rocky-mountains-found\">$2m</a> has reportedly been found in the Rocky Mountains.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had every emotion under the sun,\u201d said Sacha Dent of Kansas, who dedicated years to a quest that resulted in the deaths of up to five people.</p> <p>\u201cFirst it was shock and sadness, then on Monday a mix of happiness, relief and excitement,\u201d said Dent. \u201cI\u2019ve invested six years into this. Now it\u2019s finally over. I am very happy for the person who found it.\u201d</p> <p>An eccentric New Mexico millionaire named Forrest Fenn said he hid the bronze chest in the Rockies in 2010. The only clues to the prize\u2019s whereabouts were located in a cryptic 24-line poem written by Fenn and added to the last pages of his autobiography, The Thrill of the Chase.</p> <p>\u201cBegin it where warm waters halt / And take it in the canyon down, / Not far, but too far to walk. / Put in below the home of Brown,\u201d reads the second stanza of Fenn\u2019s poem that would send treasure hunters to scour five western states.&nbsp;</p> <p>On 7 June, Fenn, a former air force fighter pilot turned art and antiquities dealer, told the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper that a man from the eastern US had recently located his treasure, which has variously been valued anywhere from $1m to $2m. According to Fenn\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.oldsantafetradingco.com/the-thrill-resource-page\"> website,</a> it was found \u201cunder a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago\u201d.</p> <p>Neither the name of the finder nor the location of the treasure has been disclosed. \u201cI do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot,\u201d<strong> </strong>Fenn wrote on his website.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/aug/20/kit-williams-golden-hare-masquerade\">Unearthed again \u2013 golden hare that obsessed a nation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The discovery marks the end of a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any in history.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been a horrible ending to something that has been so extremely important in my life for eight years,\u201d said Cynthia Meachum, who is part of a vibrant \u201cchase\u201d community of Fenn treasure seekers. \u201cIt has affected me a lot more than I thought it ever would.\u201d</p> <p>According to Fenn, the idea that came to inspire so many was conceived in 1988 after he was diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp;The prospect of death made him think to leave part of his fortune, and even his own bones,&nbsp;in a treasure chest somewhere in the mountains. When Fenn recovered, the idea persisted, and he meticulously curated the contents of the chest for years.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fenn described a \u201cnecklace that\u2019s about 2,000 years old, and it has fetishes made out of quartz crystal and cast gold jaguar claws, and it\u2019s absolutely wonderful\u201d, in a 2018 interview with the Guardian. \u201cThere are two ancient Chinese jade carvings of human faces.&nbsp;You just want to cry when you see them.\u201d</p> <p>Fenn hoped the treasure would be an adventure that could get people \u201coff the couch\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2196787/hunt-must-go\">into the outdoors</a>. </p> <p>\u201cHe provided us all with great adventure,\u201d said Dent, who searched twice a week for years in northern New Mexico.</p> <p>Yet in the course of looking for Fenn\u2019s chest, as many as<a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/amp31977388/fenn-treasure-clues-deaths/\"> five</a> people have died, and Fenn has been criticized for endangering lives, enabling an unhealthy obsession, and even lying about the treasure\u2019s existence.</p> <p>\u201cI would implore him that he stop this nonsense,\u201d the New Mexico state police chief, Pete Kassetas, <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/state-police-chief-to-fenn-stop-this-nonsense/article_81424a8c-6282-5590-ad92-5a2a966e4771.html\">said</a><strong> </strong>after a treasure hunter\u2019s body was<strong> </strong>retrieved from the Rio Grande River in 2017, days after he had gone missing. He <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-chief-pleads-author-hid-treasure-call-off/story?id=48191277\">told</a><strong> </strong>ABC: \u201cI want people to have fun, and I want people to be adventurous, but the reality is when you have $2m or so, as it\u2019s rumored to be, at stake, people make poor decisions.\u201d</p> <p>There are the stories of people quitting their jobs and emptying their bank accounts to join the chase.

The government, the Greens, Labor, minor parties ensured that never did go to a vote. Why did you all work together on that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells:</strong></p> \n  <p>I have to say I\u2019m on leave at the moment, so I haven\u2019t been in the chamber. So I\u2019m not fully across what\u2019s happened this afternoon in relation to that. <strong>In relation to this, can I just say all lives matter.</strong> And therefore as far as I\u2019m concerned, I have to say that the activities that we\u2019ve seen, particularly of some of the protesters at a time when we are in these very difficult circumstances, I think has demonstrated a degree of irresponsibility.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas:</strong> That\u2019s the language of senator Hanson\u2019s motion that all lives matter. The reason the movement is called Black Lives Matter is black people around the world and in the US are disproportionately represented in these kinds of cases, with the police and the justice system. That\u2019s why the movement exists because there is a different treatment.</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, can I just say I respect the right of people to express their point of view and to protest. The point being at this point in time, given what we are going through, it wasn\u2019t the appropriate thing to do. I appreciate events in the US. Can I also say in relation to the events in the US, I think we do need to distinguish what\u2019s happening in the US and what\u2019s happening in other parts of the world. I do respect this issue but at this particular point in time I would have liked to have seen a lot more responsibility on the part of Australians and I know this is an issue that a lot of Australians are very upset about. There are people who weren\u2019t able to go to weddings and mourn their families.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>I\u2019m talking about the substantive issue: black lives matter. That\u2019s because black people are not treated the same in the justice system. Do you agree with that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, I think as myself being a lawyer; I think the justice system has served us well in Australia. As I have said, I think in the end what is really important is that all Australians have the opportunity to be their best. And that includes most especially having a job and so therefore the focus of our government has been on ensuring jobs, jobs, jobs. That means jobs for all Australians.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>You say the justice system as the served our nation well. Do you think it has served Indigenous Australians well?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>I think it has served Australia well. There are concerns and there have been concerns in relation to deaths in custody. But I think in the end when you do look at the reasons why young people go off the rails or things happen, it\u2019s because ultimately there has been a breakdown issue in their family circumstances or their economic circumstances. And as somebody who worked with Father <strong>Chris Riley</strong>, there are many things that contribute to young people or people going off the rails. So ultimately, stability and a very important component of that is work. So it is vitally important for us to have a strong economy and part of that strong economy is to ensure that as many people are in jobs as is possible.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:47:13.860Z\">at 7.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1d06b8f08beee219d96ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:35:52.620Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>then says \u201cAll lives matter\u201d when asked about Pauline Hanson\u2019s motion.</p> \n  <p>SIGGGGGHHHHH.</p> \n  <p>If I have to explain to anyone, again, why all lives matter is an offensive and completely tone-deaf response to Black Lives matter, please send an email to doyourresearchandthentakealookinthemirror@gmail.com</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:37:18.315Z\">at 7.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1cfee8f08beee219d96c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:34:10.802Z\">7.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Liberal senator <strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>who crossed the floor to support a crossbench motion for a Senate inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China, tells the ABC she doesn\u2019t believe it is smart for Australia to have so much trade with one country:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The point is it is not a good business model to put a third of your trade eggs in one basket.

Did the prime minister approve exports reports like he approved sports reports?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I will ask the minister to add to my answer but I absolutely reject the assertion and allegation just made by the member in the question that he put forward. Once again, the member is putting forward completely untruthful statements and he has a habit of making untruthful allegations, Mr Speaker.</p> \n  <p>The assertion that the member made regarding myself and the assertion against my character is completely rejected. It is completely rejected and I think it reflects badly on the member for making that assertion.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karen Andrews:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI am very happy to add to the answer to this question and I\u2019m happy to assist the member in his understanding of the program because he clearly does not understand how this particular program works. Now the name of this program is the SME rxport hubs and that\u2019s probably an indication of how it operates because it is a hub which means that it services an entire region. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo the assertion that the member is making clearly just demonstrates a very limited understanding of the program. So the SME export hubs don\u2019t just help those businesses located just next door to them; they actually assist a number of businesses across wide regions. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNow a clear example that I\u2019d like to actually put to the House, and this might also assist the member with his understanding, is that in South Australia we have Food South Australia. They received a grant to establish a hub in round one. They are explicitly offering to assist all businesses across South Australia. Now, let\u2019s be clear, it is based in a location but it provides support right across South Australia. So I would also like to take the opportunity to point out, Mr Speaker, that this is a competitive grant program. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAll applicants provided evidence of how they met the criteria through a two-stage application process. They were independently assessed. Now, Mr Speaker, I will just finish on this point, and that is for both funding rounds I, as the minister, accepted advice of the committee and their recommendations without change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T05:20:45.000Z\">at 6.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1bbb38f0860ca20faa1a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T05:07:10.194Z\">6.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bill Shorten </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Does the government agree that it owes all Australians, including Centrelink recipients, a duty of care to behave lawfully?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you, Mr Speaker.

Cancer-suffering grandfather <strong>Raymond Murphy</strong> had to sell his house and move to his shed to afford medical treatment. He said debt collectors ripped him to shreds over a $2,300 robodebt while he was in hospital. Why won\u2019t the government apologise to Mr Murphy and thousands of other Australians ... with their unlawful robodebt scheme?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I\u2019ll ask the minister for government services to add to the answer. The business of raising and recovering debts on behalf of taxpayers is a difficult job and it deals with Australians in many very sensitive circumstances. </p> \n  <p>Of course I would deeply regret \u2013deeply regret \u2013 any hardship that has been caused to people in the conduct of that activity. The government has many difficult jobs that it has to do dealing with Australians in very sensitive circumstances and that is true particularly at this time. </p> \n  <p>It is our instruction that we would hope that all agents of the government when pursuing the debt recovery option that they would be sensitive to people\u2019s circumstances. </p> \n  <p>And in relation to the particular gentleman that you referred to, that is a very distressing situation that you have raised. <strong>I would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue and to anyone else who has found themselves in those situations.</strong> </p> \n  <p>But the issue is one of ensuring how the government can best do this. Where there are lessons to be learned here they will be learned. That is what the minister for government services is employing now. I will ask the minister for government services to add to the answer.</p> \n  <p><strong>Stuart Robert:</strong></p> \n  <p>I would say to the member, if any member can refer any hardship cases through to me and I will ensure the department looks at it. Mental health and suicide, as we all know, and we all appreciate, are very delicate issues. There are many factors that go into them. Services Australia assess people facing difficult situations every day. We have the largest social services network to support people within federal government departments in times of crisis and vulnerability and we do this everyday. </p> \n  <p>As the prime minister said, the collection of debts is a lawful responsibility of all governments. Right now, just so that colleagues are aware in the House, 939,000 Australians have debts over $5bn that the government lawfully has to collect across a whole range of programs. </p> \n  <p>And governments of all persuasions have done this across the divide. The government has paused all debt collection across all programs as we work our way through the Covid crisis but government will have to restart that debt collection and will do it sensibly and do it engaging all people, do it in a very transparent manner. </p> \n  <p>It is incumbent on us all if we have constituents who are hurting or suffering, bring them through to me.

Prime minister, if you don\u2019t want Black Lives Matters protests to continue, why don\u2019t you do something about institutionalised racism in this country? Will you agree with the Greens proposal to put action on black deaths in custody on the national meeting this Friday and make it a future item for the future national cabinet meetings and come up with a law so we stop locking up Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at such high rates. </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I thank the member for the question on what is an extremely important issue and that is Indigenous deaths, whether it be in police custody or it be in custody more generally. </p> \n  <p>As the minister for Indigenous Australians pointed out yesterday this is already a matter of significant attention of not just the government but state and territory governments as well. </p> \n  <p>It previously did feature with more specific goals more broadly under justice headings in this area that related to the previous Closing the Gap objectives but as also featuring in the new reform set of Closing the Gap goals which is now coming to agreement for the first time involving the direct involvement of Indigenous peak groups in agreeing what those goals should be. </p> \n  <p>It is also the case that in NSW, for example, we are pleased that there has been progress that has been made in police custody. In NSW there has been one death in police custody, I\u2019m advised, since 2000 and in particular since 2000 when the new arrangements were put in place to provide for access for Indigenous persons who would find themselves in police custody to make those calls and get access to that legal advice.</p> \n  <p> Now the government is now funding that program over the next three years and that has proven to be a very effective mechanism to prevent deaths in police custody. </p> \n  <p>Every death in custody, and particular Indigenous deaths in custody, is an absolute national shame and tragedy and what the minister for Indigenous Australians has been working to do is also to address the contributing factors which find Indigenous Australians in custody. </p> \n  <p>You asked about the agenda of the national cabinet. When I announced the formation of the national cabinet going forward, I also announced the establishment of the national federation reform council. There are only two national taskforces that report to that council; importantly one deals with these very issues in Indigenous affairs, the other one deals with violence against women. </p> \n  <p>We all agreed, premiers, myself, chief ministers, that they were the issues that needed constant national priority and attention by the national federation reform council which brings all the key decision-makers together and for progress to be tracked against the successes that we hope to achieve in that area.

He seems to be unaware of the broad range of measures that the government has been putting in place, globally recognised, that are providing the necessary economic supports. We have listened carefully right across the economy. </p> \n  <p>Those working, those running businesses, and particularly to those running businesses, that\u2019s why the treasurer announced the extension of the instant asset write-off, a very important measure. </p> \n  <p>It is why the measures that kick in in July that involves further support and stimulus payments in the economy in July will be occurring. It is why one of the first things we did was to ensure that jobseeker would be at a sufficient level ...</p> \n  <p>What the government will continue to do is make decisions about the level of supports we provide into the economy based on the best possible advice and the best reading of the economic situation as that becomes increasingly clear.

Why won\u2019t the prime minister give a straight answer to this simple question: will more Australian workers be kicked off jobkeeper early or not?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>The only people talking out of both sides of their mouth when it comes to the issues of the Covid response is the Labor party. They oppose the very measures that they support. Each way on every issue has been the response of the Labor party.</p> \n  <p>Feigning, Mr Speaker, so much support for the government\u2019s response but taking every single opportunity to niggle and undermine for their own political purposes. </p> \n  <p>This is disappointing.<br></p> \n  <p>That that is the approach that the Labor party has sought to take during this crisis.</p> \n  <p>I am pleased that there are better examples.<br></p> \n  <p>There are better examples and that has been exhibited by my colleagues who sit around the national cabinet table, the Labor states who sit around that table. I have made it abundantly that jobkeeper is in place for the legislated period we have put in it place, which is until the end of September. That is what we are doing, Mr Speaker. We have been saying that consistently but those opposite have sought to sow confusion and to undermine these positions and the interjection comes about childcare.</p> \n  <p>The interjection comes about childcare. I explained the matter very clearly yesterday. We put in place a better support for workers. Over $700m in direct subsidy support to the childcare sector to support those jobs on top of the rebates, which extend to 95% rebate for childcare fees for persons who are on the jobseeker payment. </p> \n  <p>So Australians know that they are getting the leadership from this government when it comes to the economic policies and lifeline that they need to move through this crisis and as we\u2019ve seen from the OECD that has been recognised.

But, you know, the way that was done and the suggestion that they might do it again, sort of, I think, risks public support for even the issue they raise.

I want to see people going back to church and places of worship. I want to see Australia getting back to normal.

And while slave ships continued to travel around the world, when Australia was established yes, sure, it was a pretty brutal settlement. </p> \n   <p>My forefathers and foremothers were on the first and second fleets. It was a pretty brutal place, <strong>but there was no slavery in Australia</strong>. </p> \n   <p>And so I think what we\u2019re seeing with some of these protests, they start on a fair point when they\u2019re raising issues about, you know, people\u2019s treatment in custody or things like that. </p> \n   <p>Fair, fair issue. </p> \n   <p><strong>But now it\u2019s being taken over by other much more politically driven leftwing agendas, which are seeking to take advantage of these opportunities to push their political causes.</strong> And, you know, we\u2019ve got to ... <strong>I\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve got to be honest about our history. </strong>We\u2019ve got to acknowledge the positive and the negative. </p> \n   <p>But, you know, <strong>I think we\u2019ve also got to respect our history as well.

Do we need to be upfront, PM, now, about the fact that some other industries will not have jobkeeper until September as first indicated?</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> <strong>Well, I don\u2019t know why people are suggesting that.</strong> Childcare was a fairly special case because we had moved to that free childcare arrangement. What has been done is that the normal fee arrangements have come back but when working with the childcare sector, when there was a choice between going with ongoing jobkeeper or a 25% subsistence payment to the sector \u2013 so we\u2019re talking about the same amount of support which means more employees will be helped in our consultations \u2013 that was seen as the better way forward. So I think this is a very special case.

One of our major concerns is plastic pollution. Plastic bags and materials are ingested by endangered sea turtles, which mistake them for jellyfish. Plastic also pollutes the sand, making it unsuitable for turtles to nest on the protected marine park beaches, which are some of the most important nesting sites in Kenya.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the past 10 years in Watamu we have created a circular economy, employing local people to clean beaches and providing work for plastic recyclers. On World Ocean Day we cleaned our marine park beach with the Kenya Wildlife Service and 100 local community members, who will receive an income to help them support their families during these difficult Covid-19 times.

I am concerned about deforestation, a lot of which is caused by agriculture, especially young trees being cut down to make \u201cyam sticks\u201d (yams grow on a vine which is supported by the sticks). This causes the soil to erode and flow into the water, which kills the corals.</p> <p>I grew up near the ocean and studied marine ecology before working in the scuba industry. I stopped diving after I had a car accident, but it would be depressing to go back to it now: there\u2019s less fish, more algae, less coral, less life.

I grew up swimming and diving on Makarska Riviera and as a child I used to regularly see lots of fish, starfish, seahorses, seagrass, corals, crustaceans, sea cucumbers.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is nothing to see now.

We can not effectively engage with global communities and ask for their help in this fight to save our planet when many wake up every day worrying about their basic human rights. I live in a place where the natural resources are exploited by visitors and left degraded and unusable for the native people of these islands. Subsistence fishing is their birthright; the degradation of the marine environment is a violation of this right.</p> <p>On World Oceans Day my organisation took part in an in-water scuba clean of our reefs. The debris collected will be counted and catalogued. I also took part in a \u201cdawn patrol\u201d, which is a fancy way of saying I walked the beach really early in the morning to look for evidence of nesting turtles in an effort to ensure the safety of the nests and maximum return of turtles to the sea. It\u2019s weird to see it so empty here on the island because of the lack of tourism right now.</p> <h2>Canoas, Brazil</h2> <p>Jos\u00e9 Truda Palazzo Jr, 56, marine conservation writer and consultant</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d51126d2f2321af2e04e03be789a472ae9ab8e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51126d2f2321af2e04e03be789a472ae9ab8e0c/0_34_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jose\u0301 Truda Palazzo Jr and his grandson\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose\u0301 Truda Palazzo Jr and his grandson, Jo\u00e3o Pedro, Praia do Forte, Bahia, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Truda Palazzo Jr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am deeply concerned that Brazil is abandoning its responsibility as steward of an immense area of the south Atlantic Ocean. Over the last few decades, and thanks mainly to civil society mobilisation, Brazil has taken an active role in ending whaling, supporting protection for endangered marine species, promoting the concept of a global agreement for biodiversity conservation beyond national jurisdiction and establishing several marine protected areas (MPAs).</p> <p>The current government, unfortunately, has abandoned all these gains. It sees environmental issues as a \u201cglobalist plot\u201d and has halted proper implementation and enforcement of our MPAs. The world needs to wake up to this as well as to the destruction of the Amazon. I celebrated World Oceans Day by continuing to raise hell for policymakers. I want my grandson to be able to enjoy a healthy, living ocean as part of his generation\u2019s well-being and natural heritage.</p> <h2>Palmela, Portugal</h2> <p>Andr\u00e9 Amaro, 50, artist</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58f578ba7a32d772746a470def70fbe8eb422aec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58f578ba7a32d772746a470def70fbe8eb422aec/0_0_1350_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andr\u00e9 Amaro, who ocean plastics and makes clothing, interiors and art pieces\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andr\u00e9 Amaro, who ocean plastics and makes clothing, interiors and art pieces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rita Ansone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My art studio looks over Lisbon to the north and the mighty sandbanks of Tr\u00f3ia to the south.

  "<p>Over the weekend, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/07/uk-coronavirus-live-matt-hancock-health-chiefs-debate-lockdown-easing-covid-19-latest-updates\">no new deaths</a> from coronavirus in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Slowly, the number of hospitalisations and deaths is falling across the UK. Rather than celebrating these early signs that the worst of the pandemic could be behind us, however,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/05/uk-experts-call-for-coronavirus-inquiry-to-prevent-deadly-second-wave\">some scientists are warning</a>&nbsp;of a second wave of infections \u2013 an increase in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks or months, which could occur even after a sustained fall&nbsp;in the number of cases.&nbsp;</p> <p>These warnings often refer back to the 1918 flu pandemic. That outbreak killed tens of millions of people&nbsp;when it returned the following winter <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/spanish-flu-second-wave-resurgence\">in a deadlier form</a>&nbsp;after the first outbreak had been controlled.&nbsp;But there\u2019s a confusing lack of consensus from scientists about whether we\u2019ll see a second wave of coronavirus cases.&nbsp;Although the future is uncertain, we can imagine four scenarios for what might come next.&nbsp;</p> <p>One&nbsp;hypothesis, <a href=\"https://elemental.medium.com/could-the-coronavirus-be-weakening-as-it-spreads-928f2ad33f89\">floated by doctors in Italy</a>, is that coronavirus could grow weaker as it spreads. Through viral mutation, Sars-Cov-2 could lose its potency and become milder or less infectious.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>But coronaviruses have proven a remarkably stable type of virus.&nbsp;There is no evidence to support this kind of mutation occurring in a matter of years, let alone weeks. Rather than viral mutations, improvements in survival rates in Italy are probably related to better clinical management of Covid-19, as doctors learn how to treat patients in hospital more effectively.</p> <p>Another view is that the number of people susceptible to this virus is smaller than estimated, either because<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a large section of the population has already been exposed to it,&nbsp;or because&nbsp;they\u2019ve developed&nbsp;cross-immunity from other&nbsp;similar&nbsp;viruses.&nbsp;This scenario also seems unlikely. Early serology tests estimated that only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/21/17-londoners-5-rest-uk-have-coronavirus-antibodies-12739901/\">17% of Londoners and 5% of the UK population</a>&nbsp;had been exposed to the virus in late May. This means that there is still a large percentage of the population who have not yet had the chance to build immunity, a&nbsp;picture that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>corresponds with serology studies from <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-france-reopens-population-infected-coronaviruswell.html\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-spain/spanish-antibody-study-suggests-5-of-population-affected-by-coronavirus-idUKKBN22P1GX\">Spain </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/just-7-per-cent-of-stockholm-had-covid-19-antibodies-by-end-of-april-study-sweden-coronavirus\">Sweden</a>,&nbsp;which had similar results.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the picture might be more complex.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3\">A recent study</a>&nbsp;reported that individuals who had never been exposed to Sars-Cov-2 still&nbsp;had T-cells reacting to the virus, another key component of the body\u2019s immune response. The authors of the study suggested that having previous exposure to common cold coronaviruses could&nbsp;mean the body is able&nbsp;to detect the proteins in the Sars-Cov-2 virus.&nbsp;While this finding could be promising, there is <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-evidence-people-coronavirus-immunised.html\">still no&nbsp;evidence</a> that either antibodies or T-cell reactivity would result in&nbsp;someone developing immunity to Sars-Cov-2.</p> <p>A third approach, which has been deliberately adopted in Sweden, is to let the virus run its course and spread through the population. This treats Covid-19 much like the influenza virus; until a vaccine becomes available or enough of the population is exposed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-herd-immunity-yes-it-was-part-of-the-plan\">herd immunity</a> develops, the virus will be unstoppable.</p> <p>But the cost of allowing the virus to spread through the population until it develops herd immunity is that many people will become&nbsp;ill&nbsp;or die as a result of catching Covid-19. And with no <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-immunity.html\">confirmation on how long immunity</a> would even last, this approach offers no certainty about whether people could become reinfected after a couple of months or years \u2013 leading to a second wave of infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>My own view is that&nbsp;we can avoid a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/eight-lessons-controlling-coronavirus-east-asian-nations-pandemic-public-health\">second wave</a>&nbsp;if governments aggressively contain the virus through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/09/uks-test-and-trace-system-not-fit-for-purpose-say-scientists\">testing, tracing and isolating carriers</a>, and by encouraging good hygiene, such as hand-washing and environmental disinfection, supported by physical distancing where it\u2019s needed. The goal is to drive down numbers of cases to a low level so that transmission is limited to discrete, containable outbreaks with the ultimate goal of elimination.&nbsp;</p> <p>Think of this<strong>&nbsp;</strong>as a series of constantly emerging small fires that need to be extinguished quickly before they turn into an uncontrollable blaze. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/test-trace-contain-how-south-korea-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve\">South Korea</a> and Germany have effectively run with this approach,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>rolling out mass testing and tracing strategies, isolating carriers of the virus and implementing monitoring systems to map its spread.</p> <p>But the focus on deaths from a second wave may miss the real toll of the virus: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21251899/coronavirus-long-term-effects-symptoms\">long-term damage</a>&nbsp;it can cause to the lungs, heart, kidneys, brain and even blood vessels among those who recover. This is emerging as one of the horrors of Covid-19. It is often forgotten that Covid-19 is a new virus, completely different to the flu, and that it might have longer-term health impacts that will only be identified in months or years.</p> <p>If coronavirus is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-is-our-generations-polio-says-doctor-who-saved-boris-johnson-w2tk8pth0\">our generation\u2019s polio</a>, we might look towards the approach taken by governments in the Pacific.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/new-zealand-abandons-covid-19-restrictions-after-nation-declared-no-cases\">New Zealand has eliminated coronavirus</a>, and Australia is&nbsp;inching closer&nbsp;to this goal. With border checks in place, people living in these countries can return to normal life. Sports matches are taking place in New Zealand, schools have reopened, weddings are being booked and&nbsp;people can safely see relatives.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The successes of New Zealand and Australia might force other countries to rethink their own strategies, and the feasibility of eliminating the virus within their borders. Instead of living with a constant threat of Covid-19, people might start asking their own governments \u2013 why not&nbsp;try to get rid of it altogether?</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

judge appointed to review the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss criminal charges against <strong>Michael Flynn</strong> has concluded that the move represented an abuse of power.</p> \n  <p>Former US district judge <strong>John Gleeson </strong>argued in a new court filing that the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss should be denied because there is \u201cclear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gleeson, who was appointed by US district judge <strong>Emmet Sullivan </strong>to review the unusual request, accused the justice department of engaging in \u201chighly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the President.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Flynn, <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017 about his contact with the former Russian ambassador to the US. </p> \n  <p>Flynn was waiting to be sentenced by Sullivan when the justice department announced it was moving to drog the charges against him. The situation has put Sullivan in a unique and difficult position, and the judge will now have to determine whether to grant the justice dpeartment\u2019s request.</p> \n  <p>If Sullivan moves forward with sentencing, Flynn\u2019s team will almost certainly appeal the decision, so this legal saga is likely to continue.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T17:11:13.951Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee10d7a8f08beee219d908a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T16:52:04.349Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">More than 1,200 former DOJ staffers call for investigation into Barr's role in removing protesters</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 1,200 former employees of the justice department are calling for an investigation into attorney general <strong>William Barr</strong>\u2019s role in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters from near the White House last week.</p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dojalumni/doj-alumni-letter-to-inspector-general-michael-horowitz-8011bb12167b\">a letter</a> to the justice department inspector general <strong>Michael Horowitz, </strong>the former staffers said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the Department\u2019s actions, and those of Attorney General William Barr himself, in response to the nationwide lawful gatherings to protest the systemic racism that has plagued this country throughout its history, recently exemplified by the brutal killings of <strong>George Floyd</strong> and <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong> by sworn law enforcement officers acting under the color of law.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The letter noted that those who have signed on to the request have worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations.
