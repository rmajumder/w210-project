  "<p>At the end of the season, just as I\u2019m packing my kit away for the winter, I see an advert circulating on social media: \u201cSkilled cricket players needed. Casting feature film based on 1983 cricket World Cup. Players to represent West Indies, England, Australia and Zimbabwe teams.\u201d Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t hide away my whites just yet, I think.</p> <p>I send the talent agency a headshot and a brief summary of my playing ability, and a week later I\u2019m asked to Lord\u2019s to audition for the part of Chris Tavar\u00e9. To prepare I\u2019m asked to \u201chave a look at some online footage of how he bowls, bats, catches, celebrates, etc, so you have an idea of his personality traits and style\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SPromotionsUK/status/1052205659259695104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Skilled Cricket Players needed.<br>Casting Feature Film based on 1983 Cricket World Cup.<br>Players to represent West Indies, England, Australia &amp; Zimbabwe teams.<br>Email headshot, experience, contact number, location &amp; height to casting@sportspromotions.co.uk<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/castingcall?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#castingcall</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cricketers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cricketers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DrszWAqWLo\">pic.twitter.com/DrszWAqWLo</a></p>&mdash; Sports Promotions UK (@SPromotionsUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SPromotionsUK/status/1052205659259695104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I was three years old when the 1983 World Cup took place and I remember Tavar\u00e9\u2019s contemporaries Mike Gatting, David Gower and Allan Lamb better than him. But we have a similar height and build. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s \u201cstyle of play was characterised by long periods at the crease and a relatively slow rate of run-scoring\u201d, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Tavar%C3%A9\" title=\"\">Wikipedia says</a>, and I can do that. Mostly I grind it out when I play for <a href=\"http://www.pacificcc.co.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">Pacific CC</a> in the North East London League.</p> <p>Among Tavar\u00e9\u2019s most tedious innings was a score of 35 runs in six and a half hours at Madras. \u201cAs [Ian] Botham brought the crowd to its feet, Tavar\u00e9 did his utmost to make them sit down again,\u201d wrote Marcus Berkmann in Rain Men. \u201cHere was dullness personified, a walking, twitching anaesthetic.\u201d</p> <p>In one of the first YouTube videos to appear <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuMVLrEW7vw\" title=\"\">when I type Chris Tavar\u00e9</a> the Kent captain is interviewed alongside his opposite number, Botham, at Lord\u2019s after Somerset have just won the 1983 NatWest final, which followed the World Cup. He says getting \u201cTav\u201d out for 39 off 80 balls was a big moment as it opened up an end for Somerset to bowl at. Tavar\u00e9 is gracious in defeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6ff99cd30210b08184dc09544064231094eb38d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ff99cd30210b08184dc09544064231094eb38d/0_9_900_1125/800..jpg\" alt=\"A poster for the film 83.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster for the film 83.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian and Observer\u2019s own Vic Marks was the player of the match in that final, taking three for 30 from 10 overs, including <a href=\"http://cherwell.org/2017/11/21/you-never-felt-like-youd-actually-made-it/\" title=\"\">that of his friend Tavar\u00e9</a>. I ask Marks for advice before my audition. \u201cChris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice \u2013 and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,\u201d Marks says. \u201cBut he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cniRV3M8gRA\" title=\"\">Botham</a> and Bob Willis liked him a lot \u2013 as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.\u201d</p> <p>Tavar\u00e9 would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/65080/england-vs-pakistan-17th-match-prudential-world-cup-1983\" title=\"\">in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup</a>. \u201cChris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,\u201d Marks says. \u201cHe was a cautious man in several ways \u2013 he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant \u2018Come on then\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe all know Chris\u2019s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn\u2019t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af74d8be4f6163e3dfbbe3ba9e87811e7e0e547c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af74d8be4f6163e3dfbbe3ba9e87811e7e0e547c/0_0_2413_3627/665..jpg\" alt=\"Toby Chasseaud in the nets. \u2018Mostly I grind it out.\u2019\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Chasseaud in the nets. \u2018Mostly I grind it out.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: portraitcollective.com/Sam Bowle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGns4xWFo8\" title=\"\">YouTube video</a> shows highlights of Fowler and Tavar\u00e9 sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32.</p> <p>When I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord\u2019s in November 2018 I find I\u2019m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I\u2019m the only Tavar\u00e9. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGHScrCxF6Y\" title=\"\">other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981</a>.</p> <p>When I\u2019m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavar\u00e9. Then I\u2019m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don\u2019t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavar\u00e9 because a) he wasn\u2019t left-handed and b) he didn\u2019t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I\u2019m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman \u2013 not necessarily Tavar\u00e9-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I\u2019m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing.</p> <p>Next it\u2019s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven\u2019t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We\u2019re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f3e76cbeb25cfb8a995e31ff9863fbb306d3acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f3e76cbeb25cfb8a995e31ff9863fbb306d3acd/0_0_3520_2497/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Chris Tavar\u00e9 facing Rashid Khan on his way to 58 off 116 balls against Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Tavar\u00e9 facing Rashid Khan on his way to 58 off 116 balls against Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Hutchison/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I\u2019ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it\u2019s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them.</p> <p>\u201cThe Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,\u201d the film\u2019s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. \u201cWe wanted the action to be authentic.\u201d The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it</p> <footer> <cite>Cyrus Patel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They\u2019re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,\u201d Patel says. He tells me Tavar\u00e9\u2019s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League.</p> <p>When I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. \u201cI had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord\u2019s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavar\u00e9 played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3c9a02ea77d25748976c070ea050d428da89535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3c9a02ea77d25748976c070ea050d428da89535/0_133_2048_1229/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev and Deepika Padukone as Romi Bhatia Dev in the movie 83.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev and Deepika Padukone as Romi Bhatia Dev in the movie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I\u2019d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I\u2019d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn\u2019t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.\u201d</p> <p>He spent a week in August filming at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, a couple of days at Osterley CC in London, then at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and, finally, at Lord\u2019s. \u201cThey were long 12-13 hour days spent on set but we had a lot of fun,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe filmed all of the cricket action from the semi-final on a regular cricket pitch that was surrounded by green screens, so that they could CGI the [Old Trafford] stadium and crowd into the shots. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a big budget film and get to work alongside huge Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh [who plays Kapil] and [director] Kabir Khan.\u201d</p> <p>It was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"489e2b12316420144187016883cb46bd08d6adf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489e2b12316420144187016883cb46bd08d6adf1/0_0_4872_3264/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Kapil Dev sparks celebrations after taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Viv Richards in the 1983 final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kapil Dev sparks celebrations after taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Viv Richards in the 1983 final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cApart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Lord\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.\u201d Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel\u2019s words, \u201chas the feel of 1980s London\u201d.</p> <p>Going into the tournament India\u2019s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. \u201cIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,\u201d Patel says.</p> <p>In the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice. But Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were then skittled for 140 in 52 overs. They were later to find Kapil knocking on their dressing-room door and asking for some bottles of fizz as the Indian camp had not anticipated victory.</p> <p>Kapil finished the tournament with 303 runs in eight innings at an average of 60.60 and a strike rate of 108.99. He took 12 wickets at an average of 20.41 and a miserly economy rate of 2.91, and caught Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd in the final \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2fd0f0\" title=\"\">the first spectacularly so</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"669513d4e6a58bc75e2108bac6b1cc94e913fb6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/669513d4e6a58bc75e2108bac6b1cc94e913fb6d/0_0_960_960/500..jpg\" alt=\"Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev lifting the World Cup trophy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev lifting the World Cup trophy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNever did India think they would get to the final, let alone win it,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThe 1983 World Cup final was a match that transformed a nation.

And now Patel is unsure whether footage of Lowe batting will make the final cut of India\u2019s success story. Tavar\u00e9 was there but it was Kapil and his men who stole the show.</p>",
  "<p>Counter-terrorism police in the UK are investigating far-right groups accused of trying to use the coronavirus crisis to stoke anti-Muslim sentiment.</p> <p>The monitoring group <a href=\"https://tellmamauk.org/\">Tell Mama</a> said that in March it recorded dozens of incidents of far-right groups allegedly trying to put blame on British Muslims for the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The group said it had had to debunk numerous claims made on social media that Muslims were breaching the lockdown by continuing to attend mosques to pray. There were also incidents where Muslims were attacked, it said.</p> <p>In one tweet from a prominent white nationalist, claims were made that Muslims were breaching the lockdown by congregating outside a mosque in Wembley. Tell Mama debunked this claim, and after it encouraged others users to report the content, Twitter removed the tweet and placed restrictions on the account.</p> <p>A video shared on Telegram by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\">Tommy Robinson</a>, the founder and former leader of the English Defence League (EDL), was alleged to show a group of Muslim men leaving a \u201csecret mosque\u201d in inner-city Birmingham. The video was watched 10,000 times on the platform. The claims were subsequently dismissed by West Midlands police.</p> <p>West Yorkshire police similarly dismissed images allegedly showing Muslims attending Friday prayers, pointing out they were taken before the lockdown was announced.</p> <p>Shropshire police took action after a tweet from a far-right-leaning account maliciously claimed that a mosque was flouting the lockdown. The content was also reported to Twitter.</p> <p>Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, said: \u201cThese extremists are using coronavirus to get their pervasive message across that somehow the Muslim communities are to blame for the spreading of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt is mainly repeat offenders \u2013 individuals who are already known to hold anti-Muslim views \u2013 who are repeatedly seeing this as a way to cause community turmoil and tension.

Last week we saw Nicky Doll walk the plank, and were again left with the feeling that a contestant had left way too early, with more to offer ( Rock M Sakura \u2013 we love you). RuPaul is certainly making some <em>interesting</em> decisions this year. Maybe she\u2019s just had enough. Maybe she\u2019s trolling us all. We shall see.</p> <p>As episode 6 opens, Heidi pads into the workroom holding her shoes and rolling her eyes. She has the vibe of someone\u2019s aunt who\u2019s just been told by airport staff that they can\u2019t find her luggage, and we\u2019re here for it. Thank god she\u2019s still here.

Dramatic camera zooms! Rattlesnack shade noise! Cut to opening theme song!</p> <h2>Patricia Quinn dot Wikipedia dot com</h2> <p>This week it\u2019s the fan fave (and undisputably best) yearly maxichallenge, The Snatch Game. No minichallenge, for the second week running. We can see why. In years past, many of the minichallenges seemed a bit forced and pointless.</p> <p>Aiden is doing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Quinn\">Patricia Quinn</a>, the actor who played a Magenta in Rocky Horror and basically nothing else. Picking a cult indie actor no-one\u2019s heard of, for a challenge where referential humour is tantamount, is so Aiden and so, so annoying. Fun fact; we\u2019ve just been on Patricia Quinn\u2019s Wikipedia page and she also played the role of \u201csecond girl at dance\u201d in a film called Adolf Hitler: My Part In His Downfall AND she played someone called Susan White in an episode of The Bill. She is Northern Irish but somehow we doubt Aiden will be doing a British accent.</p> <h2>Miss Vaaanjie</h2> <p>RuPaul enters the workroom accompanied by ex-contestant and catchphrase queen Miss Vanjie! She made her own name a catchphrasejust by walking backwards down the catwalk and saying \u201cMiss VAAAANJIE\u201d multiple times. It spawned a stream of merch, earned her several contracts with big brands, and got her cast in multiple music videos.

We also get a quick and interesting insight into the audition process for the show, when we see a brief shot of Jan\u2019s audition clip, in which she impersonates Kris Jenner. We\u2019ve heard from our sources (drag queens on Facebook) that even just making the audition tape is GRUELLING. It requires multiple tasks and skillsets and, allegedly, you\u2019re not allowed to cut or edit it. It has to be done in one take. Blimey.</p> <p>Crystal Methyd is doing cult pop sensation Poppy!

Needless to say, Ru and Vanjie haven\u2019t heard of her because her music\u2019s actually original and legitimate and wasn\u2019t produced by Lucian Piane. OOoooh, cue shady rattlesnake noise! As much as we love Poppy, we can\u2019t see how she\u2019ll work and be funny for Snatch Game. This could be curtains for Crystal. RuPaul\u2019s being uncharacteristically human on this walkaround, dispensing sound advice and even hugs.</p> <p>Gigi\u2019s got the genius idea of doing Sophia The Robot and firmly sticks to her guns when RuPaul basically advises her not to do it. Good for you, Gigi.</p> <h2>Snatch Game</h2> <p>Here we go, it\u2019s Snatch Game! The two celebs taking part, and this week\u2019s judges are Mean Girls alumni Daniel Franzese (Damian \u201ctoo gay to function\u201d Leigh) and Jonathan Bennett (Aaron \u201cyour hair looks sexy pushed back\u201d Samuels). Heidi isn\u2019t really acting or looking anything like Leslie Jones but she\u2019s hilarious just because it\u2019s her. Jaida\u2019s Cardi B is pretty good. Jan and Widow are great as Bernadette and Tina Turner as well. This is a STRONG Snatch Game.</p> <p>Ru says to Gigi as Sophia \u201cI wonder if you can receive a big black cock?\u201d Err ... whatever happened to double entendre? Gigi\u2019s stunning, with some fab physical comedy and full of high tech puns, despite Ru\u2019s weird questioning.

  "<p>Scottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis that could have resulted in this year\u2019s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed.</p> <p>Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania.</p> <p>Farmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season.</p> <p>Recruitment agencies have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\">proposed chartering special flights</a> to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies.</p> <p>James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.\u201d Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs.</p> <p>Porter said Scottish farms produced about 25% of the UK\u2019s soft fruit each year. Angus Growers members produced 12,400 tons of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries last year.</p> <p>Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards.</p> <p>He said fruit picking was a skilled and demanding job, requiring speed, dexterity and knowledge about which fruit to pick. Migrant workers had been doing this work for 10 to 15 years, he said, and were extremely fast.</p> <p>New recruits also needed to learn how to work safely with machinery and equipment, and maintain physical distancing while picking to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus.</p> <p>He said it would take time and training for recruits to develop the skills his normal workforce had, and it was unclear whether the people who had signed up for this season\u2019s harvest would turn up or stay on if they found the job too demanding.</p> <p>Local recruits may also leave if their old jobs return and universities resume teaching once the lockdown is relaxed, he added. \u201cA lot of things have to line up and work this summer. We really are in uncharted territory.\u201d</p> <p>Similar problems confronted asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower andbrussels sprout farmers this summer, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a big chunk of people\u2019s healthy eating in the summer months, particularly in conditions like this [during the lockdown] where people aren\u2019t necessarily having a healthy lifestyle, having lots of exercise and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more important to make sure we secure the healthy ingredients they need.\u201d</p>",

His mom just lost her customer service job because of how the pandemic has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">ravaged the economy</a>, adding even more pressure.</p> <p>And yet he\u2019s soldiering on, working shifts in an intensive care unit, where he said the majority of patients are Covid-positive, intubated and ventilated.</p> <p>As he described what it\u2019s been like to treat people with Covid-19 \u2013 controlling their vital signs, increasing their oxygen, watching for frowns or other pain indicators \u2013 his voice is strained. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s very sad.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of nurses and doctors are getting sick, he said. One of his fellow nurses told him she cried before her shift because they were shouldering too much work.</p> <p>Like other medical personnel, Daniel is worried about having to wear the same PPE for 12 hours and then saving it to potentially reuse in the future. And he is concerned that he\u2019ll bring the virus back home to his family.</p> <p>But unlike other medical personnel, he also has to think about the very real possibility that someday soon, he may not be able to do his job at all.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in a career to help people,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut because of my immigration status, it just puts me in a limbo.\u201d</p> <p>Once US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) gets the go-ahead from the court, it intends to start deporting Dreamers,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/politics/immigration-kushner-trump-dreamers.html\"> the agency\u2019s acting head said </a>earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cI can only imagine what that must feel like, to be putting your life literally on the line for a country, and for the wellbeing of the residents of a country, that isn\u2019t, hasn\u2019t decided whether you\u2019re gonna be allowed to stay there,\u201d said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.</p> <p>Without Daca, Dreamers will lose the protection that has let them \u201cbuild a life in the US\u201d, said Camila Bustos, a law student intern with the Jerome N Frank Legal Services Organization.

The US would cease to be a party to the treaty six months after that, so if a new president were elected in November, the decision could be reversed before taking effect.</p> <p>Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, reconnaissance flights under the treaty have been suspended until 26 April.</p> <p>The US has complained about what it says are Russian infringements of the treaty, which was signed in 1992 and has been in force since 2002: limitations on flights over the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad to less than 500km and the creation of an exclusion corridor along the border of the Russian-occupied regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Russia imposed the limitation over Kaliningrad after a prolonged <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-01/features/open-skies-treaty-quiet-legacy-under-threat\">zig</a><a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-01/features/open-skies-treaty-quiet-legacy-under-threat\">zagging Polish overflight in 2014</a> closed down aviation for a day. Russia allowed an extended flight over Kaliningrad in February.</p> <p>One of the reasons Esper has cited for US withdrawal is to save money by not replacing the <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-04/news/us-questioning-open-skies-treaty\">two Boeing OC-135B</a> planes the US uses for its Open Skies reconnaissance flights.</p> <p>Congress appropriated $41.5m last year for the cost of replacement but the Pentagon spending request published in February contained no budget for the new planes.

But the absence of an NSC discussion does not appear to have stopped the momentum for US withdrawal.</p> <p>The Open Skies Treaty is the latest arms control agreement to be targeted by the Trump administration, which has walked out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia.</p> <p>Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said: \u201cAt a time when the need for international cooperation, couldn\u2019t be any more obvious, with respect to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, it is foreign policy malpractice for the Donald J Trump administration to withdraw from a treaty that has been in effect for nearly 30 years against the wishes of the United States closest allies in Europe.\u201d</p>",

[To] the people watching this: if you have symptoms or <strong>if you think you may have symptoms and you meet these testing criteria, you need to get tested quickly because what we do know about the virus, that people are infectious very early on and that is why we need to make the diagnosis early</strong> and then they can go into isolation and we can immediately get those contact traces made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:40:39.625Z\">at 7.40am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8979558f080bdb9f5346bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:25:55.147Z\">7.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Michael Cusack</strong> said a drop-off in cases was expected, because SA had put in place domestic border restrictions on top of the requirements for international travellers to quarantine. </p> \n  <p>That means that the number of people coming to the state, both domestic and international travellers, has dropped. </p> \n  <p>Cusack:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Obviously once that kind of tap is switched off you would expect there would be a decline in imported disease. </p> \n   <p>What the real anxiety has been and why social distancing is so important is that where the virus is in the community, there is a risk that we start to see some community spread, and that is why it has been so vitally important that we get the public to understand why they should distance themselves.</p> \n   <p>And I would have to say in South Australia the public have been fantastic at actually buying into this and doing the social distancing, and I think it is very early days but that is perhaps starting to bleed through into the numbers.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:36:52.894Z\">at 7.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e89789d8f08c35a1d11a2f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:22:47.126Z\">7.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Like every other public health officer to speak today, <strong>Michael Cusack</strong> is cautiously optimistic about the ability of his team to get ahead of the spread in their jurisdiction.</p> \n  <p>Cusack said they are \u201cobviously\u201d pleased with just two new cases recorded overnight, but added that they often see a \u201cslackening off\u201d of new cases recorded over the weekend, which suggested there could be fewer checks conducted. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into this, but we have seen a gradual decline in recent days. </p> \n   <p>That leads to a question of if we should change our restrictions, and so forth.

  "<p>I\u2019m going to tell you the single worst story I\u2019ve heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I\u2019m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/TC-Energy-sells-assets-to-help-fund-Keystone-XL-14069033.php\">financing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keystone-pipeline-spill-permit/rare-permit-for-keystone-oil-pipeline-in-spotlight-after-spills-idUSKBN1XI0L0\">permits</a>, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It\u2019s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.</p> <p>And then came the coronavirus epidemic \u2013 and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment.</p> <p>In Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/what-is-jason-kenneys-energy-war-room-good-for/\">\u201cwar room\u201d</a> to fight environmentalists, <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">invested</a> $1.1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">loan guarantee</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489960-three-states-push-criminal-penalties-for-fossil-fuel-protests-amid\">made it a felony</a> even to \u201cincite\u201d such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Guidance_on_the_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workforce_Version_2.0_Updated.pdf\">memorandum</a> exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html?fbclid=IwAR3XkPugyurel_uSz86nG7Zt6eexJ_HLZNBufOWTNas8kDmJyby5UpQpe5I\">critical</a>\u201d \u2013 that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to <em>cut</em> supply.</p> <p>On Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/04/01/news/kxl-to-go-forward-amid-pandemic/8663.html\">moving workers</a> from across America into place in states along the pipeline route \u2013 although local reporters in Montana discovered they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html\">actually begun arriving</a> 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine.</p> <p>On Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">$1.25b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">n bond issue</a> for TC Energy.</p> <p>So here\u2019s how it shakes out:</p> <p>1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are \u201cessential\u201d employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet\u2019s climate system.</p> <p>2) The work is being done on the <a href=\"https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/\">edges of many Indian reservations</a> \u2013 endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html\">endured</a> 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-the-midst-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-construction-is-set-to-resume-on-the-keystone-pipeline\">put it</a> on Wednesday, \u201cthis causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally\u201d.</p> <p>3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can\u2019t make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet \u2013 but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions.</p> <p>There are plenty of targets for anger \u2013 timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame:</p> <p><em>\u201cVice-</em><em>president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project \u2013 including all pipelines \u2013 there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health</em><em> and climate justice before any project can proceed. Vice-</em><em>president Biden believes that the approach Secretary Kerry applied in analyzing the costs and benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline and other cross-border pipelines \u2013 including to national security and diplomacy \u2013 is a model to build from in establishing this process.\u201d</em></p> <p>But let\u2019s be clear: the villains here are the oil industry and the big banks. And let\u2019s further be clear: their villainy is not new. The oil industry knew about and lied about climate change for 30 years: they\u2019ve prevented us from flattening the carbon curve, and set up a tragedy far greater even than coronavirus and one which will play out for decades to come. And the banks are their invaluable allies: Chase Bank has <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">lent $268b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">n</a> to the industry since the Paris climate accords \u2013 what\u2019s another billion to build a useless pipeline and perhaps spread a fatal disease?</p> <p>Literally nothing matters to these people except money. Even in a moment when the rest of us are changing our every habit to try and protect each other, they are willing to sacrifice nothing. No \u2013 let\u2019s be clear again. In this moment they are using the cover of the pandemic to make yet more money, to do things they could not get away with at any other time. These aren\u2019t penny-ante price gougers trying to corner the local market in hand sanitizer so they can make a buck \u2013 these are cold-blooded and calculating members of the one percent. It\u2019s so over-the-top evil that it\u2019s like the comic book version of Naomi Klein\u2019s Shock Doctrine, written in blood.</p> <p>I am a Methodist, sometimes a Sunday School teacher. I don\u2019t actually believe in hell \u2013 I think God is capable of forgiving people for the worst things. But I don\u2019t think I am.</p> <p>Though the hour is late, there may still be ways to fight this blitzkrieg. The coalitions that have battled it for a decade are, even forced apart by the microbe, now coming together to try. We will do it with real and unabating rage in our hearts.</p> <p>How could anyone be this low?</p> <ul> <li><p>Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

  "<p>\u201cAm I right in remembering you cultivate a colony of head lice in your cellar, Lee?\u201d Nicola Bridgens, former artist in residence at London Zoo, for whom I once provided the voice of a depressed black widow in an insect house installation, called me, coveting my <em>Pediculi</em> <em>humanus</em> <em>capitis</em>.</p> <p>Ten years ago, my little boy had nits. But if Paley\u2019s divine watchmaker exists, my precocious son argued, then he engineered lice to live in human hair. They were merely following their natures, so we should not exterminate them. Compromising, I decanted some specimens into a fish tank in the cellar, before destroying the rest like a Mexican god.</p> <p>A <em>Spectator</em>-type dad at kids\u2019 football told me I was \u201csentimentally prolonging the lives of lice that should perish. God invented threadworm, too,\u201d he snorted. \u201cI suppose I should allow them to party in my arsehole? Artificial improvements in survival statistics of any species preclude growth towards utopia, my friend, as do wheelchair ramps. See you next week, if you can escape your liberal bubble.\u201d</p> <p>Fellow late capitalists! Soon the market\u2019s cruel spreadsheets will suggest the cost of saving a life outweighs the economic value of a life saved. Gagged medical professionals are already making terrible decisions about who to spare. But my colony of head lice thrives, nurtured on toe-nail clippings and sock skin. Whether my lice have inherent worth or not, for me the coronavirus crisis has given them religious significance.</p> <p>Predictably, my teenage son no longer loves lice, but here I sit in the subterranean semi-dark, a generous single malt in one hand, a magnifying glass in the other, contemplating the lives of lice. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d the family ask upstairs, demanding wearisome interaction. \u201cOh, I expect he\u2019s in the cellar,\u201d my wife will say, resignedly, \u201cwith his fucking lice.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/31/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-review\">Call of Duty</a> </em>rages above, the light of my mother\u2019s memorial candle flickers through the white bodies of these translucent ghosts and my parasitical companions seem transcendentally beautiful, microscopic, ectoplasmic lobsters, carved from hoarfrost and ice.</p> <p>I have been engulfed by many similarly odd epiphanies during these long, locked-down days. Last weekend, when Bob Dylan unexpectedly dropped the contemplative psalmody of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/bob-dylan-murder-most-foul-review-jfk-assassination-john-f-kennedy\">Murder Most Foul</a>, like many old men, I sat at my desk stunned, the terrifying world temporarily transformed. On Tuesday, bright blue blossom undulated slowly on a sunlit tree and I was transfixed. And on Sunday morning, a discombobulating BBC interview with Michael Gove captivated me, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster momentarily the equal of lice.</p> <p>On his west London doorstep, words, many not demonstrably untrue, were falling out of Gove\u2019s unflapped face like molluscs made of sound. But glazed clouds of steam kept scudding over his inscrutable visage. Something hot was coming down the pipe into the front garden drain, out of shot to Gove\u2019s right. Vaporising liquid wafted between Gove\u2019s face and the camera, as if some unseen hand were attempting to wipe away stray flecks of cocaine from his nostrils with a sheet of greaseproof paper. Perhaps someone was emptying a hot bath. Or was Gove\u2019s cohabitant making her morning micturition, like a tethered wayside pony in some 70s Cornish lane, its great, golden gallons heard spattering in doppler effect from the back window of a passing family car?</p> <p>The problem with trying to write supposedly funny columns during the crisis is the speed news moves. Last week, when I filed on Wednesday, our prime minister seemed fair game, but by publication day he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">tested positive</a>, and deserved sympathy.

  "<p>Perhaps the defining image of <em>Homeland</em>, one of the most ambitious US drama series of the past decade, is Claire Danes\u2019s character, Carrie Mathison, a mercurial CIA officer, staring at a video screen and displaying a sixth sense for the vital clue. So it is fitting that Danes appears to this interviewer not in person but via FaceTime.</p> <p>\u201cLet me just get on to my wifi,\u201d she says, as the signal flickers, \u201cI thought I was. OK, that should be better.\u201d</p> <p>Danes and her husband, the British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/hugh-dancy\">Hugh Dancy</a>, who have two sons \u2013 a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old \u2013 are weathering the coronavirus storm at a country house two hours north of New York, by far the worst-hit US city. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of acclimatising to this crazy new reality where we FaceTime all the time with everybody.\u201d</p> <p>And like millions of other parents, the 40-year-old actor is suddenly dealing with the challenge of home-schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s full-on but I\u2019m trying to download math apps and order a bunch of workbooks and stuff from Amazon, hoping that\u2019ll keep them engaged.\u201d</p> <p>When the crisis erupted and brought daily life shuddering to a standstill, Danes had been enjoying her first few days back in \u201ccivilian\u201d life after a blitz of media interviews to mark the end of <em>Homeland </em>after eight seasons, 96 episodes and five Golden Globe awards. She had been looking forward to catching some theatre.</p> <p>In contrast with other art forms, pre-recorded television is immune to the virus (\u201cIt\u2019s a resilient medium, it turns out\u201d), and <em>Homeland\u2019s</em> last bow may get a ratings boost from a captive audience. They will be witnessing the end of a landmark of 21st-century television, a drama set in the world of espionage and counterterrorism that has thrilled, surprised, frustrated, courted controversy, disappointed and returned to form, swung between sublime and ridiculous and, above all, never been less than relevant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1bfd1a38af7d19add5229694f55822f153a2982d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfd1a38af7d19add5229694f55822f153a2982d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in season eight of Homeland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in season eight of Homeland: \u2018I think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u2019 Danes says of their on-screen relationship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is striking now that <em>Homeland</em> is often described as the first true post-9/11 drama when, in fact, it was born a full decade after the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001.

Its function was to mirror what was happening in the world and that\u2019s ever changing, so by definition it had places to move and grow, and it was never going to suffer too badly from stagnation.

He looks uncannily like my best friend\u2019s dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he\u2019s [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.\u201d</p> <p>When Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of <em>Homeland</em> truly sank in. She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge.

I was really struck by their patriotism, that people make profound sacrifices on behalf of our country. I took that very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Adapted for the US Showtime network from Gideon Raff\u2019s Israeli series <em>Prisoners of War</em>, <em>Homeland</em> exploded into life in 2011, when water-cooler television was still a thing and a company called Netflix was working on its first original programme, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards\">House of Cards</a></em>. Presumed dead, US marine sergeant Brody turns out to have been held as a prisoner of war by al-Qaida for eight years. He returns to America and a hero\u2019s welcome. But CIA officer Mathison can see something no else does: that Brody has been turned and is now a double agent poised to attack America. She sounds the alarm but is not believed \u2013 in part, because of her bipolar disorder. And then she and Brody have a fling.</p> <p>The first series dazzled critics, gained fans including Barack Obama and won Emmy awards for best lead actress, lead actor, drama series and writing for drama series. Season two maintained the momentum, including an audacious, much-praised episode in which Mathison interrogates Brody at great length.</p> <p>But in a recent <em>Los Angeles Times</em> interview, Gansa said \u201cit became much more difficult to write the show\u201d after that episode. A subplot in which Brody again becomes a double agent was \u201cstrained\u201d.

The team began attending an annual \u201cspy camp\u201d at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown, Washington DC, absorbing the accumulated insights and knowledge of current and former intelligence agents, diplomatic old hands and, one year, National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">Edward Snowden</a>.</p> <p>Speaking by phone, one of the participants in these brainstorming events, Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, recalls: \u201cA lot of times it was, \u2018OK, what\u2019s happening now?\u2019 We talked about that and then they talked about whichever plot they were thinking about. It was a conversation. We then went to dinner and talked about it again. It\u2019s interesting, because the more we did it, the more they had our kind of questions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America\u2019s response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of conflict and we were too reactionary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Danes has fond memories of the spy camps. \u201cThe days were long and dense,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d meet at nine and the revolving door was in constant motion, depositing one story and then another, and they were often told by people who had very different ideologies and political positions. It was a huge privilege because you really did get to look into a crystal ball from all these amazing sources and get a fairly clear picture of what our reality might be like in a year\u2019s time.\u201d</p> <p>Were there any surprises? \u201cWhen we first started the show, I didn\u2019t realise that Russians were a potentially difficult relationship. I thought we had worked through that! It\u2019s also just a shock that these people actually exist. I was interested in how that would inform a person\u2019s emotional makeup or their intimate relationships. You hear stories of people working [together] in really volatile posts for years on end and then they come home and separate: the adrenaline is gone. What it is to be so isolated, to carry all of those secrets, be shape-shifting, assuming different identities\u2026\u201d</p> <p>This brains trust helped <em>Homeland</em> take a new, more self-questioning direction. The first episode of season four was entitled \u201cThe Drone Queen\u201d, with Mathison in Kabul, Afghanistan, as the CIA\u2019s youngest ever station chief. She gives the go-ahead for a military strike on a wedding in Pakistan, killing dozens of innocent civilians.</p> <p>Season five shifted to Berlin, with Mathison having quit the CIA to work for a German billionaire philanthropist who, at one point, upbraids Berenson: \u201cNothing has made the world more dangerous than the foreign policy of the United States.\u201d The series also kept bumping up against real events. The crew was filming in Berlin just after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. </p> <p>Season six (early 2017) was even more spookily prescient on themes of fake news, Russian election interference and a president-elect at loggerheads with the intelligence community. It premiered five days before the inauguration of Trump, whose bellicose attacks on the FBI, CIA and so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d appalled Danes.</p> <p>\u201cWe worked with the intelligence community over the years, and I\u2019ve been playing somebody within it. It was hard not to feel real empathy and deep appreciation and loyalty. So when suddenly they were dismissed and undermined by a president, it was just so hard to believe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba42572a86c7ab0a70f952c30d06fc476d29134f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba42572a86c7ab0a70f952c30d06fc476d29134f/0_103_3000_1799/1000..jpg\" alt=\"F Murray Abraham and Maury Sterling in Homeland season six, which predicted Russian election interference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">F Murray Abraham and Maury Sterling in Homeland season six, which predicted Russian election interference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/JoJo Whilden/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final season has again given a voice to outside critics of American adventurism abroad, and again mirrored real events, this time with a president winding down the country\u2019s longest war, in Afghanistan. While there, Mathison is confronted by multiple gravestones bearing the same date of death, the consequence of her own past actions. And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody\u2019s shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary.</p> <p><em>Homeland\u2019s</em> politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were editorialising too much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America\u2019s] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in.</p> <p>\u201cSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently.</p> <p>\u201cHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president\u2019s helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4dbg8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2390102\"            data-video-name=\"Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC World Service / Outside Source\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-561fc22ae4b01867c5abe709\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_synd_768k_vp8-2.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\">Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline \u201cHomeland is the most bigoted show on television\u201d, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the <em>Washington Post</em> in 2014: \u201cSince its first episode, <em>Homeland</em> has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.\u201d</p> <p>The following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: \u201cHomeland is racist.\u201d No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: \u201cThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.\u201d</p> <p>On the broader issue, she says: \u201cI get it. I think it\u2019s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We\u2019re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters.</p> <p>\u201cIn most cases I think both characters were right.

  "<p>\u2018The virus does not discriminate,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-52069921/coronavirus-gove-addresses-pm-and-health-secretary-s-positive-tests\">suggested Michael Gove</a> after both Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were struck down by Covid-19. But societies do. And in so doing, they ensure that the devastation wreaked by the virus is not equally shared.</p> <p>We can see this in the way that the low paid both disproportionately have to continue to work and are more likely to be laid off; in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/amazon-strike-worker-fired-organizing-walkout-chris-smallls\">sacking of an Amazon worker</a> for leading a protest against unsafe conditions; in the rich having access to coronavirus tests denied to even most NHS workers.</p> <p>But to see most clearly how societies allow the virus to discriminate, look not at London or Rome or New York but at Delhi and Johannesburg and Lagos. Here, \u201csocial distancing\u201d means something very different than it does to Europeans or Americans. It is less about the physical space between people than the social space between the rich and poor that means only the privileged can maintain any kind of social isolation.</p> <p>In the Johannesburg township of Alexandra, somewhere between 180,000 and 750,000 people live in an estimated <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/upgrading/case-examples/overview-africa/alexandra-township.html\">20,000 shacks</a>. Through it runs South Africa\u2019s most polluted river, the Jukskei, whose water has <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Cholera-found-in-Jukskei-river-20010118\">tested positive for cholera</a> and has run <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2016-11-03-00-sewage-spill-turns-jukskei-black/\">black from sewage</a>. Makoko is often called Lagos\u2019s \u201cfloating slum\u201d because a third of the shacks are built <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/23/makoko-lagos-danger-ingenuity-floating-slum\">on stilts over a fetid lagoon</a>. No one is sure how many people live there, but it could be up to 300,000. Dharavi, in Mumbai, is the word\u2019s largest slum. Like Makoko and Alexandra, it nestles next to fabulously rich areas, but the million people estimated to live there are <a href=\"https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/mar/20/asias-largest-slum-dharavi-is-sitting-on-time-bomb--doctor-2119164.html\">squashed into </a>less than a square mile of land that was once a rubbish tip.</p> <p>In such neighbourhoods, what can social distancing mean? Extended families often live in one- or two-room shacks. The houses may be scrubbed and well kept but many don\u2019t have lavatories, electricity or running water. Communal latrines and water points are often shared by thousands. Diseases from diarrhoea to typhoid stalked such neighbourhoods well before coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b735e7b8f284a83cd37f077d481e87b6937dcee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b735e7b8f284a83cd37f077d481e87b6937dcee9/0_136_4129_2477/1000..jpg\" alt=\"People in their shanties at Dharavi during the coronavirus lockdown in Mumbai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in their shanties at Dharavi during the coronavirus lockdown in Mumbai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rajanish Kakade/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa, Nigeria and India have all imposed lockdowns. <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-04-02-five-in-isolation-after-alexandra-registers-first-case-of-covid-19/\">Alexandra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/third-coronavirus-case-found-in-mumbais-dharavi-820685.html\">Dharavi</a> have both reported their first cases of coronavirus. But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.</p> <p>Last week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. <a href=\"https://thewire.in/labour/nearly-81-of-the-employed-in-india-are-in-the-informal-sector-ilo\">Four out of five</a> Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India\u2019s working population, are <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/india-has-139-million-internal-migrants-we-must-not-forget-them/\">migrants from elsewhere in the country</a>. Yet their needs had barely figured in the thinking of policymakers, who seemed shocked by the actions of the workers.</p> <p>India\u2019s great exodus shows that \u201cmigration\u201d is not, as we imagine in the west, merely external migration, but internal migration, too. Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason \u2013 they are not seen as \u201cone of us\u201d and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/covid-19-outbreak-migrant-workers-sprayed-with-disinfectant-in-ups-bareilly/articleshow/74888857.cms\">were sprayed</a> by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.</p> <p>All this should make us think harder about what we mean by \u201ccommunity\u201d. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88/0_208_3543_2126/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Armed soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South African National Defence Force soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township on 28 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Sola/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal\">exclusively for Americans</a>, when Germany <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3bc25ea-652c-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\">blocks the export</a> of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-portugal/portugal-to-treat-migrants-as-residents-during-coronavirus-crisis-idUKKBN21F0MC\">Portugal</a>, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation.</p> <p>The rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure divisions within. In India, Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or Bh\u0101rat Mata. But it\u2019s a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill.</p> <p>In Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don\u2019t simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all at risk from the virus,\u201d observed Gove. That\u2019s true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others \u2013 and not just from coronavirus. </p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

The 30-year-old told his story from inside the Malakasa detention camp in central Greece.</p> <p>He spent the past four years in Turkey, where he met and married his wife, Hanin. Their precarious life and their wedding were documented in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/18/life-after-syria-the-migrants-tale-a-photo-essay\">a Guardian photo essay</a> last year.</p> <p>But the couple were unable to make ends meet and Hanin, by now pregnant, made the journey by dinghy to Lesbos six months ago, with Ahmed promising to follow. She arrived safely and gave birth to their daughter, who is now two months old. Ahmed has yet to meet his child.</p> <p>His first week on Lesbos was spent camping in a fenced-off area of the port city of Mytilene before he was shipped off, along with 450 other new arrivals, on a Greek navy vessel.</p> <p>Amelia Cooper, a case worker at the Lesbos Legal Centre who spoke to some of those detained at the port, said: \u201cThe suspension of the right to seek asylum was followed by deliberate attempts to isolate new arrivals and prevent their access to lawyers, journalists and members of the European parliament.\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of last month, Greek authorities began work on two sites, one in Malakasa, where 1,340 people have been sent, and another near the border with Bulgaria in Serres, which is housing 600 people. A video of Malakasa shows white tents behind a chainlink fence topped with razor wire. A Greek contractor who posted the video on 28 March, with construction work still going on, acts as narrator: \u201cThe money is flowing.

Under European law everyone is entitled to an individual assessment of their claim for protection but these documents declare that the accused must be deported for illegally entering Greece.</p> <p>For the past four years, the larger flow of people across the eastern Aegean has been reduced by an arrangement between the EU and Ankara that saw Turkey get \u20ac6bn in aid in return for restricting crossings. Under this deal, Greece has returned 2,000 new arrivals. Since early March, Turkey has stated that even this deal is dead.</p> <p> Ahmed said the uncertainty of the situation was unbearable: \u201cI lived through four years of war in Syria. This month is worse than those four years: can you imagine?\u201d</p> <p>Conditions at the Serres site, where tents are packed tightly together behind fences on a dry riverbed, are even worse than at Malakasa.

  "<p>\u201cLittle China girl.\u201d \u201cPaki doctor.\u201d \u201cBlack bitch.\u201d These are just some of the racist slurs directed at NHS nurses and doctors as they work on the frontline. I remember feeling sick when I first read <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-31/can-i-have-a-white-doctor-for-the-operation-racist-abuse-against-nhs-staff-almost-triples-itv-news-finds/\">an ITV report detailing these incidents</a> at the end of last year. And it was at the front of my mind as I whooped in support of our carers on Thursday night.</p> <p>I returned to that report last week after posting what I thought was an uncontroversial tweet, noting the fact that all four doctors who had tragically lost their lives to coronavirus at that point were people of colour, and that it was a reminder of how much the NHS relies on BAME and migrant doctors and nurses. Just <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">over four in </a><a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">10 NHS medical staff are BAME</a>, and almost <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/blogs/immigration-and-the-nhs-the-evidence\">one in three doctors are not from the UK</a>. From the first Caribbean nurses who arrived after the second world war, the NHS has been built on the backs of both migrant and British workers; in the <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/articles/WyjPPScAALyZnoX7\">late 1960s, half of all doctors</a> below consultant level were non-British.</p> <p>So I was surprised when a prominent broadcaster weighed in to lecture me on the irrelevance of my comment, then simply ignored efforts made to highlight to her the racism experienced by some NHS staff in the line of duty. And I was left pretty shaken by the 48-hour deluge of racist diatribe that ensued, a chunk of which came from her fans and followers.</p> <p>It was an effective, if painful, reminder of how racism manifests itself: not just in words such as \u201cPaki\u201d but in the self-appointed white gatekeepers who see it as their business to police celebrations of the contributions made, sometimes in the face of appalling racism, by people of colour. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been called a racist simply for acknowledging the ethnicity of the medical professionals who gave their lives to keep us safe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These anti-immigrant signalling devices are more reflective of a nastiness at the heart of government than society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So it\u2019s worth reiterating why the skin colour of our fallen NHS heroes matters. It\u2019s not just that outright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/22/anti-muslim-hate-crimes-soar-in-uk-after-christchurch-shootings\">racism and rising levels of Islamophobia</a> affect the wellbeing of NHS workers willingly risking their lives to keep us all safe, it is that, as the General Medical Council has acknowledged, BAME medics face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-treating-minority-ethnic-doctors-as-outsiders\">structural racism</a>. And the government\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric continues to legitimise discrimination at the frontline.</p> <p>While I was happy to hear health secretary Matt Hancock paying particular thanks to the migrant NHS workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus, years of racist government policy give his words a hollow ring. The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6207031/gretel-gocan-windrush-exile-return-uk/\">81-year-old Windrush nurse kept out of the UK</a> and separated from her children and grandchildren for nine years after taking a holiday to Jamaica; the \u201cright to rent\u201d policy that requires landlords to perform immigrant status checks that the high court has now ruled racially discriminatory; the punitive NHS levy \u2013 \u00a32,200 a year for a family of four \u2013 that all migrants, including NHS staff, <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/\">have to pay on top of the taxes they contribute</a> which already more than cover on average their use of public services.</p> <p>What\u2019s heartening is that these anti-immigrant signalling devices are more reflective of a nastiness at the heart of government than they are of society in general. There are far fewer people today whose hostility to immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/observer-view-uk-immigration-policy\">driven by racism</a> than there were 10 years ago; rising levels of hate crime are more likely to be a product of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/15/hate-crimes-double-england-wales\">racists feeling newly emboldened</a> and legitimised than a significant swelling of their ranks. I hope Hancock\u2019s welcome shift in tone will be matched by a shift in policy: an offer of citizenship to migrant health and care workers in recognition of their extraordinary contribution.</p> <p>But while racism still exists, it will always remain vital to pay special tribute to the contributions of people of colour. I would encourage my critics to watch this video made last year where <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-31/can-i-have-a-white-doctor-for-the-operation-racist-abuse-against-nhs-staff-almost-triples-itv-news-finds/\">surgeon Radhakrishna Shanbag</a> describes how it feels to be asked, \u201ccan I have a white doctor to do the operation?\u201d and reflect on why those tributes feel so triggering.</p> <p>In the meantime, the bullies and gatekeepers will never silence me from saying this: Amged el-Hawrani, Adil El Tayar, Areema Nasreen, Alfa Saadu, Habib Zaidi, you are all heroes, and your sacrifice will not be forgotten.

This project began for him toward the end of 2016, that disabling year, when his therapist suggested to him that \u201cit might be helpful not to spend quite so much time following the news\u201d. His response to that suggestion was a kind of personal aversion therapy: he would not shut himself off from the portents of end times that buzz-alerted his phone, but follow them to the ends of the Earth.</p> <p>To this end, he tracked down \u201cpreppers\u201d for apocalypse purchasing bunkers in South Dakota; he listened in to those disciples of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/11/elon-musk-colonise-mars-third-world-war\">Elon Musk</a> who believe our best hope is colonising Mars; he self-isolated in Alladale, the re-wilded retreat in the Highlands of Scotland; and he journeyed to New Zealand, the promised land of doom-harbingers everywhere.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like Louis Theroux cast in Heart of Darkness, he swims in the pure survivalist waters of Thiel's private lake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If there is a thread running through these travels, it is that knotted relationship between Silicon Valley plutocrats and our collective unconscious. As O\u2019Connell shows, the billionaires of digital media seem particularly in thrall to a coming apocalypse, and to lavishly self-indulgent strategies to survive it. Perhaps it is because outrageous fortunes give them control-freak dreams of immortality. Perhaps it is because they understand the darker implications of the monsters they have created.</p> <p>O\u2019Connell exposes their schemes with a likable zeal. His journey to the post-apocalypse hideaway of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation\">Pay</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation\">Pal founder Peter Thiel</a> is in itself a wonderful piece of journalism, in which he traces Thiel\u2019s obsessions \u2013 with disaster capitalism, cryogenics, surveillance technology, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> \u2013 to a piece of real estate on New Zealand\u2019s south island. Like Louis Theroux cast in <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, he swims in the pure survivalist waters of Thiel\u2019s private lake. \u201cI was drinking apocalypse water, symbolically reclaiming it for the 99%,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf in that moment I could have drained Lake Wanaka just to fuck up Thiel\u2019s end of the world contingency plan, I might well have done so.\u201d</p> <p>The disaster scenarios the quest is concerned with are mostly the terrors of climate change. Pestilence hardly gets a look-in, although you are occasionally given pause by prophetic allusions to our current circumstance. One surprising voice co-opted into Musk\u2019s belief that we need to colonise Mars as a \u201cbackup planet\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/space-travel-stephen-hawking-plutocrats-branson-bezos-musk\">Stephen Hawking</a>, who argued that \u201cto stay [on Earth] risks annihilation. It could be an asteroid hitting Earth. It could be a new virus\u2026 For humans to survive, I believe we must have the preparations in place within 100 years.\u201d</p> <p>As a premonition of that post-human planet, O\u2019Connell visits the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">Chernobyl </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">exclusion </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">zone</a>. He joins an annual 36,000 tourists on a guided tour of unimaginable catastrophe. What he sees there is less \u201ca barely conceivable tragedy of the very recent past, than a vast diorama of an imagined future, a world in which humans had ceased entirely to exist\u201d. They wander the abandoned town of Pripyat as if it were Pompeii, unearthing children\u2019s drawings in crumbling schoolrooms. Inside a vast unfinished cooling tower next to the Chernobyl plant, he watches a pair of kestrels looping high above and reaches for biblical reference, the \u201cblood-fevered edict of Isaiah\u201d, of the land lying desolate for eternity, \u201ca haunt for jackals, a home for owls\u201d.</p> <p>In some ways, experiencing this abyss, this holy of holies for catastrophists, acts as something of a catharsis for O\u2019Connell. Having looked on these human ruins, he finds himself, counterintuitively, resisting <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias\">Ozymandias-like despair</a>. What brings him back to life is the birth of his second child, a daughter, who arrives with their home in Dublin in the midst of a \u201cstatus red weather warning\u201d. Her presence, that \u201ctiny engine of joy\u201d she represents, is beautifully evoked by O\u2019Connell, in passages that capture exactly that mixture of impossible vulnerability and responsibility, the enforced mindfulness of new parenthood.</p> <p>The prophet that has provided the most comfort to him in his journey has been Dr Seuss, his son\u2019s hero, and in particular those words from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/23/dr-seuss-lorax-inspired-by-orange-kenyan-monkeys\">The Lorax</a></em>, that indelible primer in apocalypse and its unlikely flipside, hope: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d He picks those words up again here, not in any mawkish way, but as a clear-eyed rejoinder to the implications of what he has witnessed in his three-year odyssey. Among other things, O\u2019Connell is good at dramatising the way we turn things over in our minds.</p> <p>Tentatively, sporadically, he finds he is losing his taste for nihilism, that insistent thrum of doom that shadows social media habits. \u201cLately, I have been glad to be alive in this time, if only because there is no other time in which it is possible to be alive,\u201d he says. O\u2019Connell\u2019s journey to this realisation \u2013 though hugely engaging - does not always make comfortable reading with the world grinding to a halt outside, but he leaves the reader with that word, which offers the gift of making any future possible: \u201cunless\u201d. </p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://granta.com/products/notes-from-an-apocalypse/\">Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back</a></em> by Mark O\u2019Connell is published by Granta (\u00a314.99)</p>",

I get this impression that he thinks he has been driven by fate.\u201d</p> <p>This quiet sense of destiny and \u201cinnate hunger\u201d, Trickett said, seemed to affect much that Starmer did, and how he behaved. \u201cOne of the things I have noticed about Keir is that you can be walking through the Commons, or wherever it is, with him in a reasonably comradely way and then, suddenly, he would end up two strides ahead. It is just how he is.\u201d</p> <p>Yesterday the Surrey-raised 57-year-old son of a toolmaker and a nurse, who named their son after the party\u2019s first parliamentary leader, Keir Hardie, emerged not just strides<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/labour-gives-keir-starmer-strong-mandate-to-face-battles-ahead\"> but miles in front of his two rivals</a>, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, from the long contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/the-corbyn-project-is-over-but-keir-starmer-still-needs-the-left\">The Corbyn project is over, but Keir Starmer still needs the left</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The brilliant human rights lawyer who rose to become director of public prosecutions aged 45 in 2008 has only been an MP since 2015. But in a deeply divided party he managed to sweep up 56.2% of the vote, leaving Long-Bailey and Nandy way behind, on 27.6% and 16.2% respectively. Importantly, Starmer won a mandate across the board, winning the biggest share of the vote among MPs, members and affiliates.</p> <p>Many among Starmer\u2019s own supporters and within his campaign team, who tied him ruthlessly and repetitively to messages about unity during more than 40 hustings, had thought early on that it would be a much closer fight.</p> <p>Some believed he would appear too \u201clawyerly\u201d and wooden, while others feared that the left\u2019s candidate Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, would be propelled to victory by the pro-Corbyn organisation Momentum, which had the vital data on many of the 500,000 party members from the last two contests in 2015 and 2016. Another danger, his backers believed, was that Starmer, a London MP and star barrister with a square jaw and smart suits, would be seen in the Labour heartlands as another Blairite in left-wing clothing.</p> <p>But as it turned out, the left who had wanted Long-Bailey to win, including her union backers, fell out among themselves about how to carry Corbynism forward amid the post-general election acrimony, and her campaign never really took off. It was also not entirely clear how much she wanted the job and whether she felt forced against her better instincts to carry the torch for the Corbynistas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People wanted someone who could win,  someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing</p> <footer> <cite>Starmer supporter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe went missing for the first four weeks of the campaign, which made everyone think she was wobbling, and when it started it was pretty much a disaster. By that time Starmer was miles ahead,\u201d said one of her early backers. While Nandy impressed and won admirers, the MP for Wigan started too far behind, and was viewed as less tried and tested than Starmer.</p> <p>With the party shattered by its worst defeat since 1935, when the rebuilding process began, it was not ideological purity, flamboyance, or someone young and new that members across the Labour divide wanted \u2013 but someone reassuring and competent who they could see taking on and outshining Boris Johnson. And Starmer fitted the bill.</p> <p>Prominent names on the left such as Laura Parker, a former senior official in Corbyn\u2019s office and a former national organiser of Momentum, chose Starmer and was followed by many other Momentumites.</p> <p>Parker, who had seen him operate in Labour\u2019s Brexit sub-committee, said Starmer was \u201ctenacious, forensic, diligent, intelligent\u201d. His focus, determination and mastery of detail is something everyone who knows him observes. Importantly for Parker he had also, since the election, put forward a left-wing programme that for her was entirely credible, allowing her to feel it was a natural switch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/from-attlee-to-blair-what-starmer-can-learn-from-four-labour-leaders\">From Attlee to Blair: what Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe can seem cautious but the other side of that is that you feel you can believe the words that come out of his mouth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe has said there will be no rolling back from a radical programme \u2013 and I, like others who supported Corbyn, backed him on the basis of the policy commitments he had in his 10 pledges.\u201d</p> <p>One of Starmer\u2019s supporters who manned phone banks for him said Momentum members came over in droves. \u201cYou could just hear them peeling off on the phone. They wanted someone who could win, people wanted someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing as well as leading an effective opposition. They trusted him to do both. There is only a relatively small hardcore of the membership who think that ideological purity is more important than winning.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s supporters deny that his campaign had been long in the planning. But he has been very careful in his five years in parliament not to make political enemies either at Westminster or in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency party \u2013 and to shore up support against potential challenges from the local left.</p> <p>Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, suggests Starmer deliberately avoided being associated with trouble-making factions in the parliamentary party, even when it was riven by disagreements over Brexit policy, which he was in charge of from 2016 until the election. \u201cI am not aware that he had allegiances really, other than ones for temporary convenience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd/0_0_3955_2644/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact his energy seems to have been spent on avoiding factionalism at every turn. In local Labour politics it was the same. Sally Gimson, an activist in Holborn and St Pancras, says that even when he was handling the Brexit brief in the shadow cabinet, Starmer had \u201cnever been too grand to come to the smallest fundraiser or support a tiny community group\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyer Patrick Stevens, who was international director at the Crown Prosecution Service when Starmer was there, noticed the same approach when working with him before he entered politics: \u201cHe made sure he knew every person in my team from me to the most junior official and they all felt able to call him Keir. It was how he worked. In his first year at the DPP he went to every single one of its offices around the country and made sure he talked to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s upbringing in Oxted no doubt shaped his views from a very early age. His mother was disabled and had to give up work because of a rare auto-immune disorder. He remembers spending many long nights with her at the local hospital.</p> <p>The young Keir was the only one of the four Starmer siblings to pass the 11-plus, which meant he could go on to Reigate grammar school. One of his contemporaries was Andrew Cooper, founder of the Populus polling organisation, who has memories of him as a popular and clubbable boy. \u201cHe was not brilliant in class, but near the top. What I remember of him does not quite fit with his public image now as slightly dull. He was very popular. He was often the one at the centre of the crowd telling the jokes.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s more recent friends support Cooper\u2019s view, insisting he can be the life and soul of a party. \u201cHe has got lots of friends. He is a huge Arsenal fan,\u201d says Patrick Stevens. \u201cHe goes with the same group of his mates to a pub off the Holloway Road before every match. Keir also organises five-a-side games every Sunday and Monday. He sends out the texts and collects the subs.\u201d Asked about his playing abilities Stevens added: \u201cHe is a midfield general ... with a silky left foot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/party-factions-antisemitism-and-a-global-pandemic-keir-starmers-in-tray\">Party factions, antisemitism \u2026 and a global pandemic: Keir Starmer's in-tray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer studied law at Leeds University, where he took a first before graduating from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, as a bachelor of law. He was called to the bar in 1987.</p> <p>As a barrister at Doughty Street chambers, he took on a string of high-profile human rights cases, including the defendants in the \u201cMcLibel\u201d case in 1997, which he worked on \u201cpro bono\u201d for 11 years.</p> <p>Mark Stephens, a lawyer who instructed him on many such cases before Starmer was appointed DPP, said: \u201cHe had a Rolls-Royce mind and a way to apply that mind that was wonderful to watch. There was never anything showy about him. He quietly got on with cases because he believed in what he was doing. If he had gone to the commercial bar, he would I think already be on the court of appeal and knocking at the door of the supreme court, if not already a shoo-in.\u201d</p> <p>After becoming an MP in 2015 Starmer was appointed to the front bench by Corbyn to be in charge of immigration before resigning over Corbyn\u2019s leadership in 2016. Despite this he was reappointed to the front bench as shadow Brexit secretary in 2016. While the eventual Brexit position which the party put to voters in December last year was a messy compromise, it was not for lack of effort on Starmer\u2019s part. He had wanted a clearer commitment to Remain and a second referendum but had been unable to win the day with those around Corbyn.</p> <p>As he embarks on his leadership and begins to appoint his shadow cabinet today, it will not be Brexit that will preoccupy Starmer but rather Labour\u2019s approach to the coronavirus pandemic. The new leader has won a handsome mandate from a party that has placed its trust in his forensic, tenacious approach to politics and the crises it throws up. The current crisis could hardly be bigger.</p> <p>In his statement yesterday, Starmer said: \u201cWhether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That\u2019s why in the national interest the Labour party will play its full part.\u201d The coming weeks will be a test like no other in his hitherto glittering career.</p>",

We\u2019ve demonstrated that it is not necessary.\u201d</p> <p>McManus pointed to recent changes to modern awards that had been put through the Fair Work Commission over the last couple of weeks, and covered millions of workers, as an example of how measures could be reached through cooperation rather than legislation.</p> <p>She noted that not every award or enterprise agreement needed to change because some industries were doing well at the current time because of increased demand.</p> <p>McManus raised concern that in some sectors, employers might \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201ctake advantage\u201d of changes to the Fair Work Act and called on Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers to oppose such provisions.</p> <p>Unions are worried that some employers may take advantage of provisions allowing them to direct workers to run down their existing leave entitlements.</p> <p>Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/jobkeeper-loophole-could-leave-millions-of-employees-without-leave-entitlements-labor-warns\">raised similar concerns last week</a>, saying if employees were forced to exhaust their leave entitlements, the new $1,500 fortnightly payment may be transformed from a \u201cwage subsidy\u201d for employees into a \u201cbalance sheet subsidy\u201d that benefits employers.</p> <p>Porter said he would share drafts of the legislation with the ACTU and work through the details \u201cin a cooperative, open, frank and honest way\u201d.</p> <p>But he argued that failing to provide certainty through changes to the Fair Work Act could lead to additional job losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe will not be waiting or hoping that this change can be effected over the coming weeks or months by changing 121 awards and thousands of individual enterprise agreements,\u201d Porter said.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday: 6m Australian jobs depend on it. Next Wednesday, we are pushing a $130bn lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever seen and people will need to decide whether or not they\u2019re going to help us push the boat out.\u201d</p> <p>The government also confirmed the special measures to be put in place to allow parliament to sit on Wednesday amid the current health crisis.</p> <p>There are expected to be 47 \u201cpair\u201d arrangements in the House of Representatives, which would allow many MPs to be absent. Just 30 government MPs and 21 opposition MPs are likely to attend the lower house. Most of the crossbench MPs are likely to attend. Question time will be at 2pm as usual.</p> <p>Porter, who is also leader of the house, said special purpose aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force would assist in transporting MPs to and from Canberra, because of the lack of commercial flights. He indicated parliamentarians would comply with travel and border rules imposed by their states.</p> <p>The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, called on the government to schedule regular sittings of parliament - in this limited attendance form - to provide ongoing scrutiny and fix inevitable errors in drafting.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time of crisis, when the Australian people need us to get this right, the parliament meeting is more important than ever, and to think that after Wednesday we will not have to come back until August 11 is absurd,\u201d Burke said.</p>",

Those who have seen the conditions in refugee camps in and around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/fears-over-hidden-covid-19-outbreak-in-lebanon-iraq-and-syria\">Syria</a> or Somalia know how limited are the health facilities there, even at the best of times.</p> <p>The World Health Organization has reported that at least half of the world\u2019s population did not have access to essential medical care even before the pandemic struck. As the global equality charity Plan International Australia has ominously warned, many in these communities, particularly children, suffer from serious underlying conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and malnutrition.</p> <p>People living in conflict zones are doubly vulnerable. If you are an inhabitant of Idlib, for example, there is a good chance that any attempt to follow advice, stay at home and stay safe will be disrupted by a Russian or Syrian regime bombing raid. That\u2019s one reason why Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has called for a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972\">global ceasefire</a> in the face of \u201cour common enemy\u201d. There is scant evidence that his plea is being heeded.</p> <p>The UN has also warned that people in countries whose wellbeing has been damaged by unilateral sanctions, such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Cuba, could suffer disproportionately from the spread of coronavirus. This is already the case in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-52118809\">Iran</a>. All such sanctions should be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-un-sanctions/lift-sanctions-on-iran-north-korea-venezuela-in-coronavirus-crisis-un-rights-expert-idUSKBN21I2N7\">lifted immediately</a>, said the UN\u2019s Hilal Elver, to help avoid virus-related food shortages. If the Trump administration heard her call, it has done little about it.</p> <p>Food insecurity is a growing worry in sub-Saharan Africa, notably the Sahel region. If the disease takes hold there, the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/news/number-hungry-people-spikes-central-sahel-covid-19-looms\">World Food Programme</a> says, vital humanitarian supply chains in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger could be further disrupted at a time when millions already face summer food shortages caused by drought and jihadist violence.</p> <p>From war-scarred Afghanistan to the impoverished Central African Republic, where the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/march/just-three-ventilators-to-cope-with-covid-19-in-central-african-republic/\">Norwegian Refugee Council says</a> there are three ventilators for five million people, fear of imminent disaster is compounded by a chronic lack of resources. And any responses to Covid-19 will be further hampered by unresolved political and security issues left to fester for years.</p> <p>Gaza is a case in point. Two million Palestinians are crammed into an area of 365 sq km. According to the International Crisis Group, cases of coronavirus have been identified. Now <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/26/paleastinians-brace-coronavirus-outbreak-gaza-strip-covid/\">Gaza is preparing</a> for the worst. \u201cA major outbreak would swiftly overwhelm Gaza\u2019s healthcare system, which has been devastated by years of war and Israeli blockade. The death toll could be horrific,\u201d the ICG said last week.</p> <p>The potential economic impact on the developing world is also a matter of huge concern. Low- and middle-income countries have already been hurt by falling export demand, lower oil prices and a collapse in tourism. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/23/pr2098-imf-managing-director-statement-following-a-g20-ministerial-call-on-the-coronavirus-emergency\">80 governments have asked</a> for emergency IMF funding, with one estimate suggesting a total bailout of at least \u00a32tn may be necessary.</p> <p>The resilience of vulnerable states suffering anticipated shocks of such unprecedented social and economic severity is greatly limited when compared, for example, with wealthier nations such as Britain that can call on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-announces-330bn-bailout-package-for-businesses-video\">unlimited borrowing</a>. Lasting, possibly permanent pandemic-related damage increases the risk of social disorder and state violence, as seen in South Africa.</p> <p>The incidence of Covid-19 in large swaths of Africa, south Asia and Latin America remains limited for now. But there is every reason to believe a virus that has ravaged and humbled the world\u2019s two biggest economies - the US and China - will eventually spread infection to all corners of the globe.</p> <p>It is not entirely true to say there is nothing we can do but watch. Governments and individuals should support the UN and its agencies; boost foreign aid budgets; donate to international charities; share expertise; offer refuge and succour; and, wherever possible, provide vital medical equipment \u2013 all this and more can and must be done. Covid-19 is a universal nightmare, a truly global crisis. All its victims without exception deserve help, wherever they live. If efforts to control the virus in the developing world fail, the human toll could be indescribable. And the disease could become endemic, repeatedly rebounding and recycling through migration, human contacts and second- or third-wave pandemics. It does not bear thinking about.</p>",
  "<p>Bernie Sanders is not done running for president and he\u2019s tired of saying so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/us-2020-presidential-election-coronavirus-future\">The US presidential election is frozen in time \u2013 can it survive?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor the fourth time,\u201d Sanders said tartly in an interview on The View this week, \u201cwe are assessing the campaign\u201d.</p> <p>It was a response \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1240363250895728642?lang=en\">more diplomatic</a> if no less irritated than previous versions \u2013 to a question he\u2019s been getting for weeks: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGSDZMq6QjA&amp;feature=emb_title\">Why are you still in the race?</a>\u201d</p> <p>Sanders has faced calls to drop out since early last month, when Joe Biden began his all-but unstoppable ascent to the nomination. But with the race for the nomination effectively in a state of suspended animation amid the coronavirus pandemic, the 78-year-old Vermont senator has resisted.</p> <p>Covid-19 has ravaged the US economy and strained the healthcare system, claiming more than<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> 7,000 </a>lives and nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">10m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\"> jobs</a>. The twin economic and public health crises give what Sanders and allies have described as a new imperative to his calls for universal healthcare and a wide expansion of the social safety net.</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways, this pandemic has made the case for a lot of the policies that the senator has spent 35 years fighting for,\u201d said Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign. \u201cReality has endorsed Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>Since stepping off the physical campaign trail, Sanders has turned his focus almost entirely to the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis he said is on the \u201cscale of a major war\u201d. In glitchy media interviews from his home in Vermont, the senator has argued that the US would be better prepared \u2013 and more resilient \u2013 in the face of a future pandemic if his policy agenda were already in place.</p> <p>But his continued presence in the race has alarmed many Democrats, haunted by the fallout from a divisive primary four years ago they believe contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat by Donald Trump. Sanders, they contend, had a year to make the case for his political revolution and should now bow out and help unify the party.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy to say there is some path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination,\u201d Jay Jacobs, chairman of the New York party. \u201cIf he stays in this race, Bernie Sanders is doing it for one reason and one reason alone and unfortunately it\u2019s for Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb3da29e6533e4e60d572c288fecc605af69fb70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb3da29e6533e4e60d572c288fecc605af69fb70/0_86_1603_961/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with a safe elbow bump before the start of the 11th Democratic presidential debate on 15 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with a safe elbow bump before the start of the 11th Democratic presidential debate on 15 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Enough debates\u2019</h2> <p>Sanders has sent conflicting signals.</p> <p>On the one hand, he has acknowledged Biden\u2019s daunting lead. Yet he insists there is a path to the nomination, albeit a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/bernie-sanders/4140672\">narrow\u201d</a> one.</p> <p>After a dismal showing last month, the campaign <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanders-weighs-future-after-losses-to-joe-biden-11584544419\">deactivated</a> its digital ads while pausing spending on TV ads. Days later, the campaign announced it was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/bernie-sanders-will-stay-in-2020-race-until-new-york-primary/\">ramping up</a> digital organizing ahead of the New York primary, the most delegate-rich contest left. New York has since postponed from 28 April to 23 June.</p> <p>Sanders recently said he would welcome a debate in April, an idea Biden dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough debates,\u201d the former vice-president said.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 allies are split. Some have said it\u2019s time to exit while others believe he should continue to compete. On Saturday, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-top-sanders-advisers-urge-him-to-consider-withdrawing/2020/04/04/224d8164-767f-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html\">reported</a> that a group of top aides, including his campaign manager, had encouraged Sanders to withdraw. But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention.</p> <p>\u201cCampaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,\u201d Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/sen-bernie-sanders-talks-about-the-2020-race-and-vice-president-joe-biden/4141900\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he\u2019s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you\u2019re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.\u201d</p> <p>Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they diverge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cOur healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,\u201d said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. \u201cAnd I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>As the crisis deepens, support for a single-payer system has climbed. In a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/\">survey</a> this month by Morning Consult, support for Medicare for All rose to 55%, its highest point since June 2019. From February to March, net support for Sanders\u2019 sweeping healthcare proposal nearly doubled from 11 points to 20 points.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn\u2019t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed.</p> <p>\u201cSingle-payer will not solve that at all,\u201d Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid.</p> <p>Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions. On one occasion he sought to channel a wartime president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hosting a fireside chat.</p> <p>The campaign says it raised more than $4.5m for the charities and more than 14 million people have viewed its livestreams.</p> <p>Sander has also used his perch in the Senate to influence the debate over the response to the crisis. When three Republican senators objected to a provision in the $2tn rescue package that expanded unemployment insurance, Sanders threatened to block the bill unless they dropped their opposition.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, the universe is collapsing!\u201d he said, mocking their concern that the bill might give some struggling Americans extra financial support in a time of crisis. \u201cOh my word, will the universe survive?\u201d</p> <p>The recovery package, the largest ever in American history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">passed</a> unanimously.</p> <p>On Friday, Sanders released a slate of priorities for the next stimulus package that his campaign touted as \u201cthe boldest legislation ever written in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>They include monthly cash payments of $2,000 monthly to all individuals, including undocumented immigrants, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments, hazard pay for essential workers and using Medicare to pay all medical costs incurred during the pandemic.</p> <p>The plan is almost certainly a nonstarter in a Republican-controlled Senate wary of expanding federal relief beyond what was included in the last package.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971/0_73_4416_2650/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Unprecedented moment\u2019</h2> <p>It remains unlikely that Sanders can dramatically reshape the Democratic primary. He is almost hopelessly behind Biden in the delegate count and many of the biggest contests left are in states that appear more favorable to the former VP, like <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/georgia/\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/ohio/\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/pennsylvania/\">Pennsylvania</a>.</p> <p>The next test comes on Tuesday, when Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its primary despite calls from Sanders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/03/wisconsin-election-coronavirus-pandemic\">several legal challenges</a> to postpone it. Sanders will likely need a strong performance in the state to keep alive the already dim prospect of a comeback. A new <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2020/04/01/new-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-strong-support-for-coronavirus-closings-even-as-it-shows-substantial-economic-impact/\">poll</a> from Marquette Law School found Sanders trailing Biden by nearly 30 points in the battleground state.</p> <p>Sanders knows he has a decision to make. He is, as he tells every interviewer, \u201cassessing\u201d his options. Fundamentally, he believes the pandemic has changed the calculus.</p> <p>Is it possible to fall short of his presidential ambitions but succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society?</p> <p>\u201cRight now in this unprecedented moment in American history,\u201d Sanders told <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/whoopi-goldberg-spars-with-bernie-sanders-on-the-view-why-are-you-still-in-the-race?ref=scroll\">The View</a>. \u201cI think we need to have a very serious look at how we need to go forward.\u201d</p>"
