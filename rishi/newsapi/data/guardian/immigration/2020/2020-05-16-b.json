UK-born Freddy was backpacking around Australia and was at a party on Nightcliff beach one night. He was playing Beatles songs (almost certainly Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, remembers Burt) when he spotted his now-husband: \u201cI was playing the ukulele on the other side of the fire, looking at Burt, thinking, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s cute, I bet he\u2019d be a nice boyfriend\u2019.\u201d The feeling was mutual. \u201cI saw him out of the corner of my eye and I certainly enjoyed his British accent and the songs he was playing,\u201d says Burt. They wound up together at the end of the night.</p> <p>Like Freddy, Burt was visiting Darwin and had only been in town for a few months. Neither intended settling down. They\u2019d each recently come out to a few close friends, and were enjoying the freedoms of being in a new city and living on their own terms. Says Fred: \u201cI think I seemed like someone that was very confident and out but it wasn\u2019t true. It was really just because I was in Darwin and nobody knew me that I could finally be myself.\u201d</p> <p>They were inseparable after that first night. But at the end of the year, they had to return home \u2013 Freddy to Poole in the UK and Burt to Melbourne. They agreed to come out to their friends and family, and depended on each other for support along the way. \u201cWe\u2019d call each other and tell each other how it went. It all was very emotional and very important at the time,\u201d says Fred. \u201cIt was us against the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c9e4e4a8c21bbbf0fcf1bdd155dd1e6b534f81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c9e4e4a8c21bbbf0fcf1bdd155dd1e6b534f81/0_66_720_474/500.jpg\" alt=\"Freddy Grant and Burton Reynolds in November 2009\" width=\"500\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The couple not long after they met in Darwin in November 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Freddy Grant and Burton Reynolds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was particularly tough for Burt. His Malaysian family are not religious but hold traditional values and struggled to accept his sexuality. \u201cIt helped that Fred was going through the same things, understood the fear and the same sorts of feelings that I was feeling. It just so happened that Fred had a good experience with his family who were very accepting, whereas I had the opposite, and that lasted for a few years.\u201d</p> <p>After Christmas, they both returned to Darwin, but then had to formalise their relationship quickly, before Fred\u2019s visa ran out. Fred moved in with Burt and they opened up a bank account together. The added pressure they felt thanks to their immigration dramas and Burt\u2019s family drew them even closer. \u201cHaving all these outside people trying to break us up almost, it made us even more resilient and more like, \u2018well, we\u2019ll show you\u2019,\u201d says Fred.</p> <p>After spending some time together in Darwin, they travelled around Asia for a couple of years, before returning to Australia and eventually settling in Melbourne. It was a career move for both, but it helped to improve their relationship with Burt\u2019s family, who could see how committed they were.</p> <p>In 2016 Fred realised that, because he was British, they could <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/gay-wedding-at-british-consulate-exploits-legal-loophole-for-samesex-marriage-20160819-gqwyqd.html\">get married at the UK consulate in Melbourne, before it was legal in Australia</a>. They wanted to do so as a protest against the same-sex marriage debate that was happening at that time. \u201c[It was] to make the point that this is so ridiculous, every other western country has already implemented this, why are we going through this process?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/10/how-we-stay-together-weve-been-quite-heavy-risk-takers-in-some-ways\">How we stay together: 'We\u2019ve been quite heavy risk-takers in some ways'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were married in August 2016 by the British high commissioner. Even though it was a political statement, it was very personal too. \u201cI actually think it was one of the most romantic things we ever did,\u201d says Fred. \u201cStanding up in front of people, announcing our love and having this group of people watching us do it. It was all very rushed and not very scripted, we did the shortest vows that you could. [I said] \u2018I take you to be my husband,\u2019 and I burst into tears. It was really, really emotional.

  "<p>I must have walked by the shop in question hundreds of times in the years I\u2019ve lived here, and it has never looked anything other than utterly unprepossessing, all Cillit Bang and slightly dusty green peppers. But the queue at the greengrocer, marked out by the taped lines we\u2019ve all come to know so well, was more than usually long, and so it was that the other day I finally went in. I saw the fresh coriander straightaway, and grabbed it. But then I spied something else, even more lusted after: fresh naans as big as satellite dishes; Middle Eastern flatbreads as long and as soft as linen table runners. Treasure. I gathered up bags of each, paid, and went home feeling thrilled: another discovery made.</p> <p>Has this happened to you? During the lockdown, my mind maps have completely changed. I walk for an hour each day, usually at about 5pm, always heading east from my front door, which is less leafy than in other directions, but vastly more interesting: mosques nestling up to baptist chapels; plaques dedicated to long forgotten aldermen; terraced houses that seem to come in one of only two states (peeling like psoriasis, or fully Farrow &amp; Ball-ed). Sometimes, I\u2019m not after any shopping, and on those occasions I just take it all in, my eyes working to peel back the layers of the city. Often, though, I am in need of something, even if I don\u2019t know exactly what \u2013 and these perambulations are even more satisfying. I go in for tea bags or rice, and come out bearing halva, or a paper bag of the loquats, golden and mottled, that I loved in my Jaffa childhood. The other day, standing in a corner shop that seemed to specialise mostly in tortilla chips, I found a box of pink wafers. I\u2019d forgotten all about pink wafers! Reader, I bought them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pluck of  restaurants  selling dishes through a hastily fashioned serving hatch lifts the heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>City walking is mournful, of course. It tears at the heart, the sight of beloved pubs, now closed, that you only wish you\u2019d used more. Will they ever reopen? How are their staff doing? In one, a boozer of which I\u2019m particularly fond, even now a huge bowl of lemons still stands hopefully on the bar. And then there are the restaurants, shuttered and silent. Sometimes, I stop and read their menus, a rite that feels increasingly strange and melancholy. One warm afternoon, I turned a corner to be greeted by the sight of a hitherto unknown ice-cream parlour. The moment, seconds later, when I realised that its discovery would make no material difference to my life \u2013 at least for the time being \u2013 was, I can tell you, heavy indeed. (Did they sell pistachio and raspberry ripple? Peering in, I could not tell.)</p> <p>But there are moments of intense gladness, too. When the young Italian guys at the end of our street reopened their pizzeria for takeaway, happiness rose inside me, the sound of their shouting and laughter every bit as much of a tonic as the prospect of a napoletana. The pluck of the restaurants that are selling their dishes through a hastily fashioned serving hatch straight onto the street lifts the heart. \u201cWe are still here and baking,\u201d says the hand-written sign in the window of our local patisserie, and it does us so much good, on a Saturday, to buy croissants there \u2013 and, when available, a tarte tropezienne. (The cream-filled, orange-flower-scented brioche which, having been named by <a href=\"theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/20/brigitte-bardot-viva-maria-louis-malle-frozen-in-time\">Brigitte Bardot</a> when she was in St Tropez filming <em>And God Created Woman</em> - its inventor, a Polish baker called Alexandre Micka, was hired by Roger Vadim to cater for the crew - allows me briefly to slip into my swimming costume and a little Ambre Solaire, albeit only in my mind.)</p> <p>So, I walk and I walk. I am a tramper, a <em>flaneuse</em> with a rucksack and a half-memorised recipe scrolling through my mind. If I\u2019m lucky, when I get home, my neighbour Julia will have left on our doorstep one of her own fine loaves, or perhaps a wedge of victoria sponge cake. I\u2019m always hungry by this point, and I\u2019m usually much happier than when I left, too. I eat the first slice standing up, my purchases on the kitchen counter promising a future that I hope very much will come sooner rather than later.</p>",

It\u2019s a tune Aitchison might have done anyway with producer Dylan Brady (of 100 Gecs), but more DIY. Surprisingly, given that Aitchison\u2019s posturing tunes often mirror her hard-partying lifestyle, Claws is a love song. \u201cI love, I love, I love everything about you,\u201d she sings.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAo8X-rIt8k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WAo8X-rIt8k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAo8X-rIt8k\">Watch a video for Claws.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Having clocked up a number of conventional hits a few years ago, Aitchison now specialises in acrylic, outre, influencer club-pop, abetted by producer AG Cook (in Montana with \u201cbad wifi\u201d, but co-exec producer nonetheless). Her celebrated 2019 album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/15/charli-xcx-charli-review\">Charli</a></em>, took some confident strides back towards the mainstream with blowsy tracks like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKBCLHAq1do\">White Mercedes</a> and guests like Haim and Christine and the Queens. Before lockdown, Aitchison told an interviewer that she\u2019d been working on music that felt \u201cvery polished, very structured\u201d.</p> <p><em>How I\u2019m Feeling Now</em> is light on guests (purposely so) and polish. It returns to the gleeful disruption of her more ear-bleeding work, while piling on sing-song tunes. And if the interactivity of this record is, perhaps, limited to fans passing judgment on artwork, the overriding impression is that <em>How I\u2019m Feeling Now </em>is truly a work of its time \u2013 not just the Covid era, with its own Dogme-like parameters \u2013 but the always-on feedback loop of output and comments that goes with creative culture now.</p> <p>Aitchison\u2019s work is explicitly not for everyone; it aggressively foregrounds its own artifice. A song like Detonate calls on arpeggiating synths, 8-bit video game sounds and the bleeping of a detonator. In this corner of club-pop, which takes cues from trap and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/k-pop\">K-pop</a>, skull-drilling repetition is a feature, not a bug.</p> <p>Aitchison has never specialised in over-intellectualisation, preferring bangers that live in the giddy moment. Pink Diamond (\u201cI just wanna go real hard\u201d) is all icy drama. Anthems, too, boasts OTT rave stabs (and the faintest impression of Basement Jaxx). It\u2019s a paean to partying, with added self-knowledge. In all this lairiness you find occasional admissions that Aitchison is trying to fill some void. Another song, C2.0, is an ode to how she is missing \u201cher clique\u201d; of all these tracks, it sounds the most thrown-together.</p> <p>If these songs are more off the cuff than before, nothing here sounds unprofessional. Some lyrics have not exactly been sweated-over \u2013 \u201cI love you forever, even when we\u2019re not together,\u201d goes Forever \u2013 but they chime with people feeling acutely separated from loved ones.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0D2fZ_P0Hg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T0D2fZ_P0Hg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0D2fZ_P0Hg\">Watch a video for I Finally Understand.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The song is, of course, another heart emoji to Kwong. It\u2019s not the last. \u201cYou love me even when I hate myself, I\u2019m sure,\u201d intones an Auto-Tuned Aitchison on I Finally Understand, whose excellent bouncy beat comes from producer Palmistry; 7 Years is a hydraulic ballad that spans Aitchsion and Kwong\u2019s long on/off affair.</p> <p>In a Zane Lowe interview, Aitchison remarked that her and Kwong\u2019s relationship had been physically and emotionally distant prior to lockdown. Quarantine had brought them closer. \u201cHow do you express that you\u2019re in love with someone 10 different times on an album without just sounding sycophantic?\u201d she joked. If the title flags its own diaristic intentions, <em>How I\u2019m Feeling Now</em> reflects this workaholic party animal\u2019s gratitude for love.</p> <p><em>How I\u2019m Feeling Now is out now via Atlantic/Asylum.</em></p>",
  "<p>Anger is growing over the government\u2019s failure to abolish the surcharge many migrant healthcare workers must pay to access the NHS, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/government-reviewing-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-medics\">Priti Patel suggested it was under review three weeks ago</a>.</p> <p>It has emerged that the Home Office did not specifically review the charges beyond exempting on a one-year extraordinary basis both those whose visas were due to expire before October from that fee and the \u00a3400 surcharge, which will rise to \u00a3625 a year each later this year.</p> <p>The department faces renewed condemnation for not permanently scrapping the charge after the deaths of several migrant NHS workers during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe have repeatedly called for the immigration health surcharge to be waived for nursing staff,\u201d a spokesperson from the Royal College of Nursing said. \u201cThey are already contributing through taxes and national insurance \u2013 to ask them to pay twice is simply wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThis charge must be stopped. Following her announcement that the charge was being reviewed, we wrote to the home secretary urging action.

All government policies are continuously kept under review.\u201d</p> <p>After Patel\u2019s apparent announcement,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/calls-grow-scrap-nhs-surcharge-migrant-healthcare-workers-coronavirus\"> there were mounting calls</a> for the surcharge to be permanently ditched. It was introduced in 2015 as part of hostile environment laws designed to discourage illegal immigration and combat health tourism. The surcharge must be paid alongside taxes and national insurance contributions.</p> <p>Dr Chandra Kanneganti, the national chair of the British International Doctors Association, said: \u201cWe know BAME doctors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19\">are disproportionately getting ill</a>. To have to pay for the same service that they are putting their lives at risk for doesn\u2019t seem fair. This charge needs to be scrapped completely for NHS overseas workers.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said the surcharge raised about \u00a3900m for the NHS between 2015 and 2018-19. During this time the cost has repeatedly risen and healthcare workers have said they struggled to pay the fees. For other doctors and nurses, the charges are probably a deterrent when they consider coming to the UK.</p> <p>At the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing last month, Patel said in response to a detailed question from ITV regarding the surcharge: \u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary said, in light of the exceptional circumstances that coronavirus presents, it is right that policies are kept under review.</p> <p>\u201cThis includes how the immigration health surcharge applies.

  "<p>A decade ago, my father, Terry Lee, found a wooden sign behind our cottage\u2019s boathouse. He guessed it had once hung above the door, naming this Ontario lakeside property: Brynmorwydd. Dad, who grew up in Cardiff and emigrated to Canada in the 1970s, knew right away it was Welsh. But the cottage, which originally belonged to my stepmother\u2019s family, was actually an exercise in Canadianness for my dad, who isn\u2019t exactly handy with canoes or campfires. I don\u2019t suppose he ever anticipated that it would draw him back to Wales, but some weeks later he spotted the name of the cottage\u2019s first owner stamped on one of its beams: John G Bolt.</p> <p>He searched deeds, records, maps and censuses with the help of my uncle, and the story emerged of John Bolt, born in 1886 near Llanrhaeadr, north Wales. The son of a gamekeeper, he moved away to Cheshire at the age of eight, after his parents died. In 1927, Bolt sailed to Canada and worked on the Canadian Pacific Railway: he claimed a plot of land, built a cottage, and named it after the estate where he\u2019d been born: Brynmorwydd.</p> <p>Dad and I arrived in Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch in summer 2013. Fog spread over the valleys, obscuring the sheep. It had been a decade since we\u2019d holidayed together. While dad was renovating the cottage, I\u2019d been living in England. But this trip was designed to bring us together: he wanted to track down the original Brynmorwydd; I was doing a PhD in landscape history. We felt like an ideal team.</p> <p>Each day, we ventured out in search of clues: the estate no longer existed, and while some placenames remained, few buildings did. We had an 1875 OS map, which I compared with Google Maps, searching for the spot where Bolt was born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"649141aca2baf89727a8d62b50cb32ef98dfb48f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/649141aca2baf89727a8d62b50cb32ef98dfb48f/0_114_1719_1311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Lee returns to Wales with a photo of his beloved Brynmorwydd sign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Lee returns to Wales with a photo of his beloved Brynmorwydd sign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Terry Lee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We stopped in the pub and chatted to the barman. \u201cA bit of an odd request,\u201d dad began, his Welsh lilt swimming into the corners of his now-Canadian accent. \u201cWe\u2019ve come from Canada, where we own a cottage by the name of Brynmorwydd \u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll want to talk to the gentleman in the corner,\u201d said the barman, pointing to an elderly man eating Sunday dinner. \u201cHe grew up in the estate\u2019s main house.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed too coincidental. The man told us the land was up a narrow lane. And private. Undeterred, we drove up the winding lane to the crest of a hill. There was hardly anything there. An abandoned building, a gate, a No Trespassing sign and a wide valley view: a green quilt with hedgerow seams. Was this what John Bolt longed for? Dad pulled out a photograph of the wooden sign and posed for a picture.</p> <p>We open our cottage each year when the ice on our bay has melted. Among the teapots and old photographs, a folder entitled \u201cJohn G Bolt\u201d holds the papers we carried as we combed the countryside. On every visit, I open it to check the pages are in order, then look for my father. He may be fumbling to split logs or tidying the boathouse. Once in a while he\u2019ll rest, looking over the water that stretches before our Brynmorwydd.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.jessicajleewrites.com/\">Jessica J Lee</a> is an author and environmental historian.

  "<p>I emerged from the belly of the ferry in Rotterdam, blinking like a newborn. I wobbled off on my bicycle with my teenage son, unused to the weight of my panniers \u2013 unused to cycling at all, actually \u2013 and definitely not fit. My end goal was Istanbul, more than 3,000 miles away, and I wondered if I would ever make it. But I had a cunning plan: I would cycle the flat river valleys of the Rhine and Danube, and by the time I reached the Balkans, I\u2019d have cycled myself into fitness. Or so I hoped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f0a9ee37a5b6ab2bf9d3d68fa0475aaa761e7bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f0a9ee37a5b6ab2bf9d3d68fa0475aaa761e7bb/0_0_829_573/500.jpg\" alt=\"rotterdam to istanbul cycling route\" width=\"500\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">rotterdam to istanbul cycling route</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cycling along the Dutch canals, I was filled with anxiety. What if my bicycle broke down in the middle of nowhere? What about the aggressive dogs that roamed the streets of eastern Europe? And the pickpockets? How would I manage the hills away from the valley plains? What if my sit-up-and-beg bike was too heavy? Asher, our Couchsurfing host in Dordrecht on our first night, echoed my fear. \u201cHelen, this is a bicycle to cross town on, not a continent.\u201d My Dutch bike, which I\u2019d affectionately named Gertrude, was rechristened \u201cThe Tank\u201d.</p> <p>But as we continued along the Rhine and Danube, something shifted inside me. The anxiety that had forced me to leave my job \u2013 and had been the impetus for this journey \u2013 was falling away. I no longer worried about the \u201cmight-bes\u201d and tuned into the moment. Along the Rhine, the riverbanks were bursting with wildflowers and the sky was filled with birdsong. I sensed my bird-loving father \u2013 ailing back home \u2013 with me on the journey. I felt his presence in the gentle two-note call of the cuckoo floating on the air, the bubbling song of the skylark on upland meadows and the comical chimney-top storks\u2019 nests lining Danube villages.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The further south and east we travelled, the more joyful I felt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The further south and east we travelled, the more joyful I felt. There was something wonderful about turning the pedals and waiting for the world to unfold. We spun through meadows of ox-eye, viper\u2019s bugloss and, yellow rattle, and poppy-splashed barley fields. We bumped along cobbled streets of rainbow-painted towns. Back in the countryside, a grass snake slithered across our path and a fawn ran out in front of our bikes. We saw an enormous carp rise from the Danube as we ate our <em>butterbrot</em>.

In Bratislava, a passing cyclist took half an hour out of his day to show us the way. In Hungary, Zita housed us and fed us to bursting point, pouring cherries into our hands as we left. In Serbia, Sashka and her family gave up the top floor of their house for us. In Romania, a smallholder rushed out of his garden to offer us beef tomatoes. In Turkey, we were entertained by a table of mustachioed, tea-drinking farmers. It wasn\u2019t just the rivers and their birdsong that were healing me, it was the kindness of strangers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d4ded1dbd291c997e216a5e4a2a6e969a1dccfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d4ded1dbd291c997e216a5e4a2a6e969a1dccfa/0_0_898_539/500.jpg\" alt=\"The writer\u2019s son at the Black Sea.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The writer\u2019s son at the Black Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Moat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we reached the Sea of Marmora in Turkey, I knew we could make it.

But from the 2008 financial crisis to the vote for Brexit in 2016, from the rise of the alt-right to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is no way of properly grasping our world without thinking about how neoliberalism informs our politics and economy.</p> <p>But what is it? Broadly speaking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world\">neoliberalism</a> can be defined as the raft of policies and overarching political ethos that enabled governments in the late-1970s to turn away from state-directed economic planning, towards an economic model that extended competitive markets into every sphere of human activity and initiated the reign of finance capital (the kind dreamed up in the City of London and Wall Street) by removing constraints on capital mobility.</p> <p>Importantly, neoliberalism is not merely a policy agenda but also a moral framework that teaches individuals to conceive of themselves not as, say, wage earners but rather as risk-taking entrepreneurs who should expect to shoulder the financial risks of their participation in higher education, the credit system and deregulated labour markets.</p> <p>First implemented as an economic programme in the UK and the United States by the Thatcher government and the Reagan administration, its principles continued to underwrite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">third </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">way</a> politics of New Labour and Clintonite Democrats. Although centre-left politicians reject the applicability of the term to their politics, a wealth of scholarship produced by economists, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246256989_From_Thatcherism_to_New_Labour_NeoLiberalism_Workfarism_and_Labour_Market_Regulation1\">sociologists</a> and historians demonstrates how third-way politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/blair-thatcher-legacy-labour-zarah-sultana\">advanced the neoliberal project</a>.</p> <p>So, where does the ideology stand today? Some are <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/coronavirus-spells-the-end-of-the-neoliberal-era-whats-next/\">calling time</a> on the neoliberal age. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://paulmason.substack.com/p/day-one-of-uks-suppression-strategy?fbclid=IwAR2IZCzgpr9-gw23yDNugVaJd6tN2E2xJ_B06S_ossyCrlHCwe4SZFSBRrU\">Paul Mason declared</a> that the exigencies of the crisis would mean that, in short order, the UK\u2019s political class would soon consist entirely of either \u201centhusiastic\u201d or \u201creluctant socialists\u201d \u2013 progressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">state intervention</a> was inevitably back on the agenda. However, claims of this sort should be treated with caution, not least because similar predictions were made following the financial crisis, and after the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president. And those predictions turned out to be seriously awry.</p> <p>For instance, at the height of the financial crisis, the Nobel prize-winning economist <a href=\"http://16beavergroup.org/articles/2008/10/24/infoshop-the-philosophies-of-deregulation-and-neoliberalism-are-dead-in-the-west/\">Joseph Stiglitz announced</a>, \u201cNeoliberalism \u2026 is dead.\u201d Yet it soon became abundantly clear that this was premature. It is true that the crisis seemed to pose a serious threat to the veneration of markets, as governments were forced to bail out the financial sector. But, as scholars such as <a href=\"https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/02/neoliberalism-movement-dare-not-speak-name/\">Philip Mirowski</a> have shown, neoliberals have long understood that their project requires state intervention to create and maintain markets. Rather than thinking of the crisis-fighting of governments in 2008 as a repudiation of market-friendly policy, it\u2019s more useful to think of it as an extreme instance of pro-business government intervention that aimed to maintain the long-term primacy of the market.</p> <p>On the face of it, the vote for Brexit and the election of Trump appeared to more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/american-neoliberalism-cornel-west-2016-election\">plausibly represent a break</a> with neoliberalism. But that diagnosis arose from a failure to understand how neoliberalism can adaptively recombine with elements of other ideologies.</p> <p>While the Brexiteers may loathe the European Union (an institution that neoliberal intellectuals have <a href=\"https://braveneweurope.com/quinn-slobodian-and-dieter-plehwe-the-neoliberals-who-opposed-europe\">long disagreed about</a>) they remain committed to the core of neoliberal ideology. For example, the Australian points-based immigration system \u2013 so beloved by the Brexiteers \u2013 is perfectly congruent with the neoliberals\u2019 view of human beings as bundles of assets (of greater or lesser value). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/19/the-post-brexit-immigration-plans-at-a-glance\">post-Brexit immigrant</a>\u2019s educational background, work experience and connections are redefined as forms of capital that may or may not be worth investing in (by letting them in) in order to secure a future return on that investment for the national economy. Points-based immigration systems, in other words, do not represent a straightforward shift away from neoliberal, free-market orthodoxy towards rightwing protectionism.</p> <p>If neither the crises of 2008 nor 2016 signalled the end of neoliberalism, what about Covid-19? Today, as in 2008, politicians such as Rishi Sunak have been forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e77d3267-21f5-4369-bf08-0cf0f31ae3ff\">implement policies</a> that seem to contradict their adherence to market supremacy, but the intention is again to do so in order to swiftly return to \u201cnormal\u201d and wean the public off their \u201caddiction\u201d to state support. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-to-cut-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-cq2bfxl5p\">frustrated desire</a> to curtail the furlough scheme, and the clear opposition to implementing a universal basic income, indicate a commitment to maintaining the core of neoliberal welfare policy. This means opposing generous, non-means-tested payments, which neoliberals view as detrimental to fostering entrepreneurial activity and disciplining the workforce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/uk-freeze-private-rents-homelessness-coronavirus-labour\">The UK must freeze private rents now \u2013 or thousands will be made homeless | Joe Beswick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More disturbingly, in the context of pandemic and the climate crisis, the persistence of the neoliberal view of individuals as human capital raises the possibility of governments treating populations of \u201clow value\u201d as <a href=\"https://lpeblog.org/2020/04/27/nationalism-and-neoliberal-governance/#more-3508\">disposable</a>. Increased state intervention to protect incomes is welcome, but could be used by governments to implement a kind of economic triage, with populations deemed not worth \u201cbailing out\u201d excluded from state support. As <a href=\"http://www.fordhampress.com/9780823285723/mutant-neoliberalism/\">Michel Feher</a> has shown, there are milder precedents for this in welfare reforms carried out by mainstream political parties in Ireland and Portugal, which reduced benefits for younger cohorts in order to encourage emigration and, in the case of Portugal, to swap young, relatively poor Portuguese for wealthier retirees from abroad. In a context of ballooning national debt, where migrant populations are being treated as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/malaysia-cites-covid-19-for-rounding-up-hundreds-of-migrants\">vectors of disease</a>, it\u2019s not difficult to see how an exclusionary neoliberal politics that supports investment in certain populations and disinvestment in others could gain traction.</p> <p>All of this is not to deny that the Covid-19 crisis poses a real threat to neoliberal orthodoxy. Physical distancing and enforced quarantine have <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/04/27/dont-fight-the-last-war-why-the-left-needs-to-look-beyond-austerity/\">disrupted the labour market</a>, potentially shifting the balance of power between labour and capital in favour of workers. The increase in <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-covid-19-has-workers-striking-where-are-the-unions?fbclid=IwAR03VFO75BoVjgHGweV0x156uf4vkGlz6H1RZ8qJRDciVSzayus8pgiNoBs\">wildcat strikes</a> and the emergence of mutual aid groups are certainly encouraging. And the furlough scheme has temporarily revealed the artificiality of government spending constraints. But given the persistence and adaptability of neoliberal ideology over the past 10 years, any sober assessment of the current situation needs to be attuned to the possibility of its survival (or successful mutation), as well as its possible demise.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Doherty is the host of the Politics Theory Other podcast</p>",

  "<p>For about five weeks, the mayhem of coronavirus rendered the political mayhem of the previous four years irrelevant and dated. The divisive, petty, mendacious battles that had been waged in the name of Brexit suddenly appeared for what they were all along: conflicts conjured out of thin air by newspaper editors and their friends in the Conservative party. The era of digital \u201cfake news\u201d and memes was replaced by the sobriety of daily press conferences. Ministers broke their childish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">veto of the BBC\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">Today</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\"> programme</a>. Boris Johnson ran for cover behind civil servants and academics. All eyes turned towards the cold objectivity of statistics.</p> \n<p>We can date the opening of this window with some precision. Johnson\u2019s general election honeymoon (which included holidays to Mustique and Chevening) came to a halt when he attended his first Cobra meeting on coronavirus on 2 March. We can only imagine the shock and disappointment Johnson must have felt, as it dawned on him that his premiership would not be remembered for Brexit at all. There followed weeks of earnest policy analysis, and when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">lockdown finally arrived</a>, it was accepted as the authoritative decision of experts.</p> \n<p>We can date the closing of this window with equal precision. On 6 April it was announced that the prime minister had been taken into St Thomas\u2019s hospital with Covid-19, and the next day he was moved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">into intensive care</a>. By the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">Johnson had re-emerged</a> on 12 April with a video thanking the NHS staff who had saved his life, the mood had changed. Led by certain newspapers, the sense of measured proportionality that had governed public debate over the course of March was now lost, and an impassioned Covid nationalism was born.</p> \n<p>For the press, with whom Johnson has always been so intimate, the prime minister\u2019s illness was an opportunity to abandon the concern with aggregate mortality rates which had dominated the news for the previous month. The body of the leader now provided a symbol to focus on. \u201cMay Boris and Britain get through this battle,\u201d intoned Charles Moore sombrely in the Telegraph. \u201cYour health is the health of the nation,\u201d Allison Pearson pleaded to Johnson. Britain has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">lost more lives to Covid-19</a> than any nation in Europe, but its hero has survived. With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy\">arrival of a new Johnson baby</a>, followed by the 75 anniversary of VE Day, the Johnson administration spotted a path to reprieval. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6bb54d3cda7aa83ac545191f5b94b2aed6378654\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb54d3cda7aa83ac545191f5b94b2aed6378654/995_907_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Red Arrows over London on the 75th Anniversary of VE Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Red Arrows over London on the 75th Anniversary of VE Day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uk Ministry of Defence/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The fact that Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings are in Downing Street at all is down to their intuitive grasp of symbolism and messaging, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">floored their opponents in June 2016</a> and again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/bombastic-boris-johnson-wins-huge-majority-on-promise-to-get-brexit-done\">in December 2019</a>. During the hiatus of March 2020, as the government scrambled desperately for a position on coronavirus, this skill seemed to desert them. Messages were all over the place, to the point where scientists were liberated to throw around jargon about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-herd-immunity-yes-it-was-part-of-the-plan\">\u201cherd immunity\u201d</a>. But when a line was found, it stuck: \u201cStay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>The status of the NHS here is interesting, and not a little troubling. As soon as horror stories started to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-may-have-been-in-italy-for-weeks-before-it-was-detected\">emanate from Lombardy in February</a>, it was clear that the worst possible nightmare on Britain\u2019s horizon was of the NHS being faced with far more Covid patients than it could treat. The phrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/flatten-the-curve-why-predicting-coronavirus-infections-and-deaths-is-so-tricky\">\u201cflatten the curve\u201d</a> means specifically reducing the peak to within hospital capacity. But over time, the ambition to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d has taken on such momentum, it has come to overshadow the third part of the slogan, \u201csave lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>The video that Johnson released on exiting hospital made the extraordinary gambit of elevating the defence of the NHS above the defence of the public:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset \u2013 our National Health Service. We understood and we decided that if together we could keep our NHS safe, if we could stop our NHS from being overwhelmed, then we could not be beaten, and this country would rise together and overcome this challenge, as we have overcome so many challenges in the past.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This was an ingenious piece of political rhetoric, sidelining the methodical and morbid question of body counts, and replacing it with a national story of collective identity and sacrifice. Where a standard utilitarian logic might presuppose that health policy should be judged in terms of outcomes for human welfare, now Johnson was suggesting that human welfare was a price worth paying to preserve a cherished symbol of health policy. Such rhetorical acrobatics were all the more impressive from a man who had been at death\u2019s door only five days earlier.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The symbol of the NHS has become entangled with other national icons that hark back to the second world war</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The draping of the union jack across the NHS has produced some sickly results. The gratitude that is felt towards health and care professionals has been profoundly moving to experience and witness, and the weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2020/may/07/doctor-calls-for-ppe-from-roof-as-uk-claps-for-carers-video\">\u201cclap for carers\u201d</a> is one of its many valuable expressions. But over the weeks, this spirit of spontaneous solidarity has thickened into something more forceful and censorious, potentially something angrier. Johnson\u2019s supporters in Westminster have turned on journalists for probing the government\u2019s performance too critically, as if any criticism was a sign of disloyalty to the national effort. Challenged in parliament by the Labour MP and A&amp;E doctor Rosena Allin-Khan about the shortage of available PPE, health secretary Matt Hancock suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/05/matt-hancocks-career-continues-to-win-the-battle-with-his-conscience\">she change her \u201ctone\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>As the weeks have passed, the symbol of the NHS has become entangled with a host of other national British icons, many of which hark back to the second world war. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/capt-tom-moore-thanks-people-for-support-on-his-100th-birthday\">100th birthday of Captain Tom Moore</a>, who raised an astonishing \u00a330m for NHS charities by walking around his garden, was celebrated with a flyover by two fighter planes from the era, a video message from the PM and a promotion to the rank of colonel by the Queen. Moore revealed that he\u2019d received a letter of congratulations from 103-year-old Dame Vera Lynn, whose song \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d had topped the charts, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/08/we-will-meet-again-when-a-monarch-brings-comfort-with-a-song\">Queen referenced the famous wartime number</a> in her televised lockdown address to the nation.</p> \n<p>As much as the left might wish otherwise, the NHS has always been available as a potential nationalist icon. As David Edgerton details in <em>The Rise and Fall of the British Nation</em>, the invention of \u201cBritain\u201d as a post-imperial nation state, defined as a national economy with a single people, was initially a project of the Labour party more than the Conservatives. Edgerton points out that the manifesto on which Clement Atlee won the 1945 election, and that set out plans for an NHS, contained the words \u201csocialist\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d three times, but the words \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cnational\u201d nearly 50 times. Years before wartime mythology and nostalgia took off in the 1970s and 80s, it was Labour \u2013 and not the Tories \u2013 who did most to create a sense of \u201cBritain\u201d as a single imagined community.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The litany of care workers who have died could scarcely be more ethnically and nationally diverse \u2013 a testimony to how little nation matters</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A more extreme version of health nationalism has been bubbling away on the far right for some years. The alleged problem of \u201chealth tourism\u201d, of foreigners exploiting the generosity of the NHS, has been repeatedly referenced by Nigel Farage, and is a common trope among English nationalists such as Tommy Robinson. Governments have occasionally indulged this sentiment, with Hancock accusing Labour of giving a \u201cfree rein to health tourism\u201d during the election campaign. Theresa May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d migration policy (the cause of the agonising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/the-week-that-took-windrush-from-low-profile-investigation-to-national-scandal\">broke in 2018</a>) also sought to deploy the NHS as an instrument for deterring immigrants from settling in the UK. A <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026120914177\" title=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026120914177\">new sociological paper</a> by Des Fitzgerald, Amy Hinterberger, John Narayan and Ros Williams examines how Vote Leave seized on the NHS as a symbol of shared British \u201cheredity\u201d, the means through which the nation reproduces itself culturally and biologically. The vision of free healthcare, for the people and by the people, is a seductive part of Britain\u2019s national mythology.</p> \n<p>As the Covid crisis has confirmed in the starkest possible terms, the everyday reality of health and care services in the UK flies in the face of this jingoism. The litany of those who have died in the course of their professional care work could scarcely be more ethnically and nationally diverse \u2013 a testimony to how little nation matters, where expertise and basic humanity are concerned. This could, of course, be a basis on which to reset the story of \u201cBritain\u201d, in ways that take stock of its globally connected, porous nature. But at the moment, that story is losing the battle for column inches with false memories of the second world war.</p> \n<p>With the government lashing itself to the NHS, and then lashing the NHS to Dame Vera Lynn, a new facet of populism looms into view, in which critics and statisticians become tarred as useless naysayers. The possible political benefits to Johnson (who is born to this style of fact-free leadership) are obvious, but the potential consequences for policy are quite terrifying. It emerged during April that the UK\u2019s true death-toll was at least twice as high as the government was insisting, once care homes were taken into account. According to an investigation by Reuters, a decision was made in mid-March to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-elderly-sp/special-report-in-shielding-its-hospitals-from-covid-19-britain-left-many-of-the-weakest-exposed-idUSKBN22H2CR\">transfer 15,000 patients out of hospitals</a>, back into the community, including many who had tested positive for Covid and would return to care homes. So desperate was the effort to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d and free up capacity, it seems that infections were being released into the care sector. Still the government\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d tally of deaths only counts those which have occurred in hospitals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80190013-6673-49ce-b5f1-7bdbd26e9fb8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gNuL1wgTVYU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson has never been as popular as he was during his hospitalisation. Like most national leaders, his approval ratings have risen as a result of this crisis, and the Conservatives have been consistently polling at around 50%. Having the worst death toll in Europe clearly counts for less in the eyes of the public than the rallying around of our resolutely <em>National</em> Health Service. The style of politics that Johnson mastered over the previous four years has returned, and it is delivering for him, just so long as the accumulation of deaths can be slotted into a narrative of sacrifice and community.</p> \n<p>But as with previous nationalisms, the communities doing the narrating are not the same as those doing the grieving. It\u2019s here that the cultural politics of Brexit potentially resurfaces. Study a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/coronavirus-uk-latest-deaths-confirmed-cases-and-which-regions-are-hardest-hit\">map of where Covid-related deaths</a> have been concentrated, and the eye is immediately drawn to major cities: London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow. A lower concentration of mortality sweeps up the middle of the country, from the south-east, through the West Midlands, up to the north-west and on towards Scotland. But the east and west of the country are far less affected. It\u2019s not a perfect fit by any means, but the map loosely resembles a more familiar one: the 2016 referendum result. The virus presents the greatest risks to those inner city urban areas, such as Hackney and Stockport, which voted remain. </p> \n<p>This overlap is scarcely surprising. The remain vote was clustered in centres of international connectivity and intense commercial activity, both rich and poor. The choice to remain was a choice very often connected to the larger international world of global capitalism, travel and urban life. It is these same things that allow a virus to spread. Conversely, the disconnection experienced by rural leave voters also reduces their risk of infection. The interests of rural, car-driving England are not necessarily those of the inner cities, though the stakes are now of course far higher than just culture. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f14ae8e3fc9c3d317a530a5750bb529effd09dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f14ae8e3fc9c3d317a530a5750bb529effd09dd/154_308_3564_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vote Leave bus parked outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vote Leave bus parked outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The continuity between coronavirus Britain and Brexit Britain is greater than we might have imagined, and certainly greater than it appeared during those five weeks before Johnson\u2019s hospitalisation. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that Johnson \u2013 like Donald Trump \u2013 was elected to office on the back of an anti-metropolitan, anti-liberal cultural platform. Johnson\u2019s core vote is predominantly outside of those Covid danger zones of the inner cities and clusters of prosperity. Johnson, like Donald Trump, represents people who believe in the value of hard work, but don\u2019t do very much of the really unpleasant hard work themselves, either for reasons of wealth or age. They believe in \u201cunleashing\u201d the economy, less in a macroeconomic sense, and more in the sense of ditching all the red tape and political correctness that comes from government administrators and universities.</p> \n<p>This is how opposition to the European Union can shift seamlessly into opposition to the current lockdown. Some have pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of rightwingers who gave not a hoot for GDP when it came to Brexit, suddenly expressing their concern for Britain\u2019s economy when it comes to coronavirus. But there is more consistency here than initially appears. Theirs is a worldview that cares little for statistical aggregates, whether that be GDP or Covid-related deaths. It pays scant attention to economists or epidemiologists, claiming to know what\u2019s in the public interest, indeed it sets little store by the very idea of a \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the first place.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/national-emergencies-britain-government-health-covid-19-1940s-and-50s\">When it comes to national emergencies, Britain has a tradition of cold calculation | David Edgerton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Instead, the purpose of the economy, from this conservative perspective, is to inculcate independence, both at an individual and a national level. The national economy should be self-reliant, manufacture its own goods, and employ its own people. It\u2019s this national economy that globalisation, Brussels and lockdown all inhibit, and therefore need overturning. For the inner-city cleaner or hospitality worker, whose life would now be put at risk by a newly \u201cunleashed\u201d economy, the injunction would be to take more care, change jobs or take out life insurance. But it\u2019s not the government\u2019s problem, and it\u2019s certainly not the problem of the typical Tory donor whose investment portfolio is currently under the cosh.</p> \n<p>Johnson may not hold this worldview personally, but it is the one that propelled him to power, thanks to the victories of 2016 and 2019, masterminded by Cummings. Voices in favour of this libertarian economic nationalism have grown steadily louder since the lockdown began, and their vision of Britain is crystallising: fewer Chinese imports, fewer universities, lower immigration, more indigenous manufacturing and put the young and unemployed to work in the fields. No pain, no gain. It\u2019s not an ideology commonly held by people who work in the genuinely wealth-producing centres of British capitalism, nor by the generations who will pay the greatest financial cost for this crisis over the coming decades. And the lockdown retains remarkably widespread public support. But it is an ideology to which Johnson will keep on nodding, and which is being drip-fed to the public by rightwing newspapers, Tory backbenchers and opaquely funded thinktanks. His confusing televised statement on Sunday night, which urged people back to work without any clarity around how this should occur, was clearly crafted partly to please conservative hardliners who are appalled by the current scale of state interventions.</p> \n<p>Even with the most metropolitan and internationalist party in power, the coronavirus would force some reassertion of the nation state, as a legally binded entity with a common historical trajectory. There is no use trying to imagine Britain out of the story that we are living through. The question is whether a version of Britain can be imagined and described that avoids the worst nationalist excesses that are now stirring, as the death toll climbs, the NHS becomes a political shield and the wartime nostalgia tightens its grip.</p>",
  "<p>Every day during the coronavirus lockdown, the government has hammered home the need for the public to take daily exercise. The irony is that the UK\u2019s more than 7,000 gyms and leisure centres are shut, leaving the population to improvise with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over\">Joe Wicks</a> on YouTube and cobbled-together workouts in the park.</p> <p>More than 10m memberships were effectively put on ice when gyms closed in March, and we now know gyms will be among the last businesses to reopen come the summer.

Now expansion plans are on hold and businesses face an altered landscape.</p> <p>David Minton, director of the Leisure Database Company, a market intelligence firm, sees tough times ahead in the short term with about 300 struggling sites vulnerable to permanent closure. He predicts about one in five people will ditch memberships. \u201cAll the sites that have been losing money will not reopen so that will be the first area of shrinkage,\u201d he suggests.</p> <p>There will also be a clearout of \u201csleepers\u201d \u2013 a lucrative group who pay a membership fee for a service they never use. Around 12%, or 1.2 million, of the country\u2019s gym members fall into this group, Minton says, but their monthly payments will have been stopped by clubs during the pandemic, effectively making the decision for them.</p> <p>The other factor to consider is the \u201cJoe Wicks effect\u201d, Minton adds: \u201cHave people actually got into a habit, and will that prevent them from going back into a gym where they may not necessarily feel safe?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a801e0970c8770e6b9ae19f73ba110276cf1c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a801e0970c8770e6b9ae19f73ba110276cf1c37/0_173_5222_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a woman works out with weights on a street corner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DIY workouts are taking place anywhere and everywhere in the UK, except in the gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ukactive, the industry\u2019s trade body, <a href=\"https://www.ukactive.com/covid-19/\">has drawn up guidelines</a> to help gyms get back to work. The advice includes spacing exercise equipment 2 metres apart or marking every other machine as out of order. A gym\u2019s maximum capacity should be based on 3 square metres per person with the same maths applied to swimming pools. Markings could be drawn in a studio to ensure socially distanced zumba classes. But most importantly, it describes the need for a cleaning rota that would put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/08/mrs-hinch-cleans-up-with-book-sales-as-britons-tidy-homes-in-lockdown\">Mrs Hinch</a> to shame.</p> <p>It will not be easy.

High-use areas will be cleaned every couple of hours with PureGym\u2019s premises closing at night for deep cleans. The purchase of expensive <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51914722\">robot cleaners</a> that use light beams to zap surfaces is also being weighed up, he says.</p> <p>Gym goers will also have to become more hygiene-conscious. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get a discipline established in members,\u201d says Cobbold. \u201cYou wipe down [equipment] before, you wipe down afterwards. If they are sensible, members will want to do that.\u201d Wearing face masks is also on the cards. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got an obligation to not transmit the virus to other people, then I think that\u2019s a direction we\u2019ll probably end up going in,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>The financial crisis triggered by the pandemic is also testing the partnerships between local authorities and leisure operators, typically charitable trusts, who run gyms and swimming pools on their behalf. <a href=\"https://communityleisureuk.org/\">Community Leisure UK</a>, which represents such trusts, says some are at risk of going under after falling between the cracks of the state support schemes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Huw Edwards, the chief executive of Ukactive, is concerned some contracts will end up being cancelled, which would mean leisure centre closures: \u201cThe government needs to provide ring-fenced funding to prevent communities losing their public leisure provision.\u201d</p> <p>For some sports, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

  "<p>I withdrew \u00a3200 from an ATM in mid-March \u2013 and I still have \u00a3160 left collecting dust in my wallet. Even one of the last reasons to keep a stock of coins in my car has gone, because the local supermarket has unchained the trolleys that previously needed a \u00a31 coin. Coronavirus is wiping out cash in the UK, and it will probably never return.</p> <p>Should we be bothered? Maybe. On my trip to the supermarket on Monday I also saw a lonely, frail and nervous gentleman, who looked to be in at least his 80s, taking cash out of the ATM. He probably shouldn\u2019t have been out, but clearly this was something he felt he really had to do. Never has there been a bigger gap between those of us who are abandoning cash, and those who still see it as crucial to their life.</p> <p>The Age UK boss, Caroline Abrahams, says it\u2019s deeply worrying that some older people are telling the charity that their cash supplies have run out and they are worried about how they will pay for their shopping.</p> <p>The good news is that the elderly gentleman I saw bent double over that ATM may not need to go back, if someone lets him and others like him know that the Post Office, and some banks, may deliver cash to their door.</p> <p>If you have a Post Office card account and are deemed vulnerable, that can be as much as \u00a32,500. NatWest, Barclays and Tesco Bank will also deliver to your door if you are a vulnerable customer.</p> <p>NatWest will generate a code over the phone for those over 70 to give to a friend or neighbour so they can withdraw an agreed amount from an ATM within the following three hours.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not fetishise cash usage. It\u2019s striking how many older people have switched to online banking and contactless payments since the lockdown began. Halifax says the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63%, and their use of contactless has also soared.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the increase in the UK of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/24/limit-for-contactless-spending-to-rise-to-45-at-beginning-of-april\">contactless limit to \u00a345 </a>at the start of April has made cash all but redundant for most. Either tap-and-go, or tap in four numbers for spending above \u00a345. Why bother to use an ATM, which will soon become a curiosity, a bit like a BT phone box. Around 250 disappear every month from our streets and malls, and not that many people even notice.</p> <p>A cashless society is cheaper (it costs billions every year to distribute notes), more honest (no more tax cheating from cash-in-hand payments) and safer (not much for muggers to steal or for drug dealers to do business in). Above all, for smartphone-wielding millennials, it\u2019s just far more convenient.</p> <p>The drawbacks? Bad news for everyone from buskers to beggars to churches that rely on cash donations. More importantly, some people will lose track of their spending, unable to budget wisely. Society\u2019s most marginalised, those not formally within the banking systems, could almost become non-persons.</p> <p>The banks love the switch to a cashless society, which should be a cause for concern in itself. A handful of giant players, such as Visa and Mastercard, will control the entire payments infrastructure \u2013 until one or both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/01/visa-card-network-crashes-and-sparks-payment-chaos\">fall over</a>, which even if it is only temporary, has the potential to freeze the entire financial system.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the \u201cbig brother\u201d implications of having every penny of our spending logged and traceable.</p> <p>These drawbacks sound worse than the benefits, but they will be largely ignored as the convenience of contactless wins out. And as any millennial will tell you, budgeting is actually much better using the tools of an app rather than relying on the purse strings.</p> <p>Coronavirus is simply hastening the inevitable end of cash and coins. There was an enormous hullabaloo when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/apr/14/abolition-cheques-reconsidered-payments-council\">the banks set a date for withdrawing cheques</a>, and they hurriedly backtracked. Quite rightly, they put in place measures to ensure that those who really needed to use them could still do so.</p> <p>We need similar measures to protect people who will still need access to cash. But make no mistake, we are not on a stepping-stone to a cashless society, we are nearly there already.</p> <p><em>patrick.collinson@theguardian.com</em></p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global number of confirmed cases passes 4.5m</h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University at least 4,542,752 people are known to have been infected and 307,696 people have died worldwide since the pandemic began. The figures are likely to represent a significant underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic.</p> <h2>Democrats push $3tn response bill forwards</h2> <p>The US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill crafted by Democrats to provide more aid for battling the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republican leaders, who control the Senate, and Donald Trump have vowed to block it, despite some Republican support for provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.</p> <h2>Trump unveils \u2018warp-speed\u2019 drive for vaccine by year\u2019s end</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has announced details <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">of a \u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine</a> by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months. During remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/truck-protest-donald-trump-coronavirus\">to compete with honking from protesting truck drivers</a>, the US president also urged schools to reopen in the autumn and insisted: \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back.\u201d</p> <h2>Mexico sees highest daily confirmed infections</h2> <p>As Mexico moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy from Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions, AP reports. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with over 2,000 new cases.</p> <h2>Trump to restore partial funding to WHO - report</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to restore partial funding to the World Health Organization, <a href=\"https://fxn.ws/3bFNpuG\">Fox News reported late on Friday</a>, citing a draft letter. The Trump administration will \u201cagree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions\u201d to the WHO, Fox News reported, quoting from the letter. Trump suspended US contributions to the WHO on 14 April, accusing it of promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <h2>Italy to allow travel to and from abroad from 3 June</h2> <p>Italy\u2019s government has approved a decree allowing travel to and from abroad from 3 June, moving to unwind one of the world\u2019s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns. The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback but the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.</p>",

  "<p>When Jagath Karunaratne was first taken into custody at Fiji\u2019s largest prison, he was held in a small, concrete cell. Normally, he says, prisoners are held here for a night while their more permanent dormitory accommodation is organised. But Karunaratne alleges he was was held there for a month.</p> <p>In the cell block he says he had no bed, no bedding except a scratchy sheet, and was given a bucket to use for a toilet. He claims he was allowed to empty this once a day and every night was forced to sleep next to his own excrement.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not a pleasant experience,\u201d says Karunaratne, the president of the opposition Freedom Alliance Party (formerly Fiji United Freedom Party). \u201cI was kept there with a bucket as the toilet with little bit of water in it and only 10 minutes in the morning to go and have a quick shower, and the whole day locked up. No exercise, no sunshine.\u201d</p> <p>Karunaratne was convicted of spray-painting anti-government graffiti and sentenced to more than two years in April 2018, alongside an opposition MP. He was released in August 2018, after the director of public prosecutions dropped its case.</p> <p>Since gaining his freedom, Karunaratne who is still in politics, wants to highlight the plight of prisoners in Fiji, saying that the conditions in remand centres mean that people often come out far worse criminals than when they went in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"825eabe43877fb2677ab4b13be59583fae4a73cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/825eabe43877fb2677ab4b13be59583fae4a73cc/0_0_3543_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jagath Karunaratne inside his office at the Toganivalu Legal office where he currently works as an associate and consultant in Toorak, Suva.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jagath Karunaratne at the Toganivalu Legal Office, where he currently works as an associate and consultant in Toorak, Suva.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jovesa Naisua/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Karunaratne said he was told by the correction officers that he was kept in the cell for so long for his own safety because he was a political prisoner.
