The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

The company pays only for hours they have actually worked and the government makes up the difference.

And when faced with a pandemic, the government sprung into action earlier than anywhere else in India.</p> \n  <p>Health minister, KK Shailaja, who swiftly earned the nickname \u201cCoronavirus Slayer\u201d, was the first in the country to assemble a taskforce in mid-February to begin aggressively contact tracing, testing and quarantining any possible cases. The state also closed all schools, restaurants and banned gatherings before any other and began setting up public sinks and hand sanitiser dispensers in public places, even at bus stops. The state has one of the highest testing rates in India, though it has also faced a shortage of testing kits.</p> \n  <p>And when prime minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24 with four hours notice, causing havoc for the millions of migrant workers stuck thousands of miles from home. The Kerala authorities set up camps and provided provisions for their three million \u201cguest workers\u201d, preventing the dangerous exodus of people trying to get back home. A total of almost 19,000 relief camps have since been set up in Kerala, providing three meals a day. In comparison, in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state which has one of the highest numbers of migrant workers, just 2,000 camps have been set up.</p> \n  <p>Those in the camps are being given regular health checks and they even made arrangements to charge migrant workers phones, set up a helpline call centre which speaks five Indian languages. They also established a counselling service and when protests broke out in the camps by the migrant workers from northern states that they were only being fed rice, their diet was adapted to suit northern India tastes, including chapati, dal and pickle. In one camp, a Bengali kitchen was established. Across the state, mobile health workers are visiting the elderly and vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, experts are warning against celebrating the state\u2019s success too early, especially as cases nationwide continue to steeply increase, and Kerala reported two new cases on Monday. On Sunday the Ministry of Home affairs also issued a rebuke to the Kerala state government for easing restrictions, with Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla issuing a thinly veiled warning against states that were \u201cdiluting\u201d the lockdown.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d8a9a8f08b7689b031b05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:52:17.138Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>China\u2019s</strong> health authority called for a stronger and more rigorous testing regime to ensure that the new coronavirus does not escape detection, whether in travellers arriving from abroad or from other parts of the country. </p> \n  <p>All localities must improve their testing capabilities, including those at border crossings, and report any epidemic information in a timely manner, the National Health Commission cited its director Ma Xiaowei as saying.

It is the first known case in Borno, the epicentre of jihadist conflict that ravaged the region for over a decade. <br><br>According to a statement by MSF this morning, the aid worker, whose identity has not been revealed, tested positive in a post-mortem test. MSF said its teams \u201chave strengthened infection prevention measures, hygiene facilities, infection control and isolation spaces.\u201d<br><br>Authorities are now working to trace the worker\u2019s contacts and abate a spread of the virus within one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. <br><br>Almost two million people are displaced in northeast Nigeria, with almost 3 million in urgent need of food aid according to the World Food Programme. Several humanitarian organisations operate in the region, providing essential help. The insurgency has decimated the key services millions in the region rely on, including its health system.<br><br>On Sunday night, the UN said a major priority is to decongest refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands live in squalid conditions, unable to return to their homes. Yet it is a huge challenge as many areas across Borno and the north-east remain unsafe, exacerbated by a recent withdrawal of soldiers into so called super-camps. After relentless attacks by jihadists, soldiers have redeployed to better defend their positions but NGOs in the region say it has left many towns more vulnerable to insurgents.<br><br>There are 627 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country of 200 million people. Yet the daily rise in cases is gradually accelerating, with 86 new cases confirmed yesterday. Nigerian authorities have only tested about 7,000 people, and whilst countries around the world are struggling to boost testing capacity, many West African countries have tested more per million people. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d80ef8f08b7689b031aba\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:01:19.677Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US scuppers G20 coronavirus statement on strengthening WHO</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US hostility to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics.</p> \n  <p>The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body\u2019s China-centric approach, reflected \u2013 in his view \u2013 by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-scuppers-g20-coronavirus-statement-on-strengthening-who\">Read more here.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:28:11.285Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d71c78f08b7689b031a0e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:00:48.220Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the latest developments around the world on the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper reported</strong>.

He said Japan\u2019s initial approach \u2013 to identify and contain infection clusters \u2013 had worked well until major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka started reporting significant rises in cases from the second half of March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJapan\u2019s government should have changed strategy earlier,\u201d Iwata said, referring to the shift to wider testing combined with social distancing. \u201cThere was a tremendous delay and that has caused huge problems,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Hospitals initially designated to treat patients with the illness had become unable to deal with the growing number of cases, leaving other hospitals unprepared to fill the treatment gap. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t prepared and your staff aren\u2019t trained, you can\u2019t just admit Covid-19 patients,\u201d Iwata said. \u201cMany hospitals are not ready to fight against Covid-19. That\u2019s why [there have been reports] of ambulances going from one hospital to another\u201d in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and other cities.</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cWe needed to change strategy immediately, but traditionally, Japan isn\u2019t good at doing that. When we have a plan A we are poor at converting it into a plan B.

Local governors can request that people stay home and that nonessential businesses close, but there are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance. In Tokyo, many places have closed their doors, but some bars, restaurants and cafes remain open, with many of the city\u2019s streets far from empty.<br><br>Iwata said the lack of urgency implicit in the measures meant people still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/clash-looms-in-japan-as-tokyo-governor-says-abes-covid-19-measures-not-enough\">hadn\u2019t understood the importance of staying home and social distancing</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe government didn\u2019t send the right message to people \u2013 that you need to distance yourself from others to block the route of transmission.

  "<p>A massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in 2010, experts warn, 10 years after the disastrous explosion of BP\u2019s rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>The blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism.</p> <p>But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission\u2019s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill.</p> <p>Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/deepwater-horizon-mexico-10-years-on\">\u2018We\u2019ve been abandoned\u2019: a decade later, Deepwater Horizon still haunts Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDisasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you\u2019re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that can go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,\u201d Beinecke said. </p> <p>Richard Sears, the commission\u2019s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but \u201cthere are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b7b69307a4b482e1ea84c6ade9ccad7311ac02b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7b69307a4b482e1ea84c6ade9ccad7311ac02b/8_32_2021_1213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engineers from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement inspect an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineers from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement inspect an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEverybody has to stay vigilant,\u201d Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk.</p> <p>Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization.</p> <p>In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling.</p> <p>The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig.</p> <p>Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry\u2019s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Trump has pushed an agenda of \u201cenergy dominance\u201d, which critics say encourages industry to take risks.</p> <p>A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US \u2013 more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE\u2019s director repeatedly calling them \u201cpartners\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,\u201d the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017.</p> <p>Internal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-safety-rules-on-oil-drilling-were-changed-some-staff-objected-those-notes-were-cut-11582731559\">emails</a> suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns.

Low oil prices \u2013 from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking \u2013 haven\u2019t kept them out of the water. Most of the $93m in leases sold by the US in the Gulf last month were in <a href=\"https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/14170058/gulf-of-mexico-lease-sale-yields-93-million-in-winning-bids\">deep water</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOffshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,\u201d said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. \u201cThese are being drilled in deep water and they\u2019re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they\u2019re being drilled in more complex geology.\u201d</p> <p>One study found that for every 100ft deeper a well is drilled, documented incidents <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142151201141X?via%3Dihub\">increase 8.5%</a>.</p> <p>The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about 5,000ft, or close to a mile, down.

The 2008 League One play-off final against Doncaster. Just after the second half restarted, Donny scored what turned out to be the winner. A mate of mine had gone for half-time Tin with his mate, who had then gone to relieve himself and didn\u2019t hear the roar for the goal. Full-time approached and my mate\u2019s mate, under the influence, turned and said: \u2018We will win in extra-time!\u201d And he\u2019s not lived it down yet\u201d \u2013 John Lowe.</p> <p>\u201cI went to a flamin\u2019 game my team didn\u2019t even lose.

The 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic started in April and was followed, in the US and temperate northern hemisphere, by a second wave in the autumn.</p> \n<p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p> \n<p>While second waves and secondary peaks within the period of a pandemic are technically different, the concern is essentially the same: the disease coming back in force.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back elsewhere?</strong></h2> \n<p>This is being watched very carefully.

In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration \u2013 which has triggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">protests in the US</a> and elsewhere \u2013 and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p> \n<p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p> \n<p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p> \n<p>As Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote strikingly for the Washington Post in March: \u201cEpidemics are like fires. When fuel is plentiful, they rage uncontrollably, and when it is scarce, they smoulder slowly.</p> \n<p>\u201cEpidemiologists call this intensity the \u2018force of infection\u2019, and the fuel that drives it is the population\u2019s susceptibility to the pathogen. As repeated waves of the epidemic reduce susceptibility (whether through complete or partial immunity), they also reduce the force of infection, lowering the risk of illness even among those with no immunity.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problem is that we do not know how much fuel is still available for the virus.</p>",

It is a viable and much needed business and without it Australia will struggle to get its economy back on track once the crisis abates. There is still time for the federal government to work on an investment plan to get through this period of crisis and taxpayers will get a double benefit. </p> \n   <p>The government will retain a competitive aviation market and they will get a return on their equity stake.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister has promoted the concept of hibernation, of keeping viable businesses afloat through this crisis.

We believe it is also in the interest of the travelling public that Virgin remains a viable airline to ensure an efficient, reliable service right across Australia.

Thomas Markle, who lives in Mexico, had been expected to walk his daughter down the aisle in the ceremony at Windsor Palace, and was revealed by the Mail on Sunday to have helped stage paparazzi pictures of himself preparing for the wedding.</p> <p>In one text, Harry attempted to rescue the situation before the wedding. \u201cTom, Harry again! Really need to speak to u. U do not need to apologize, we understand the circumstances but \u2018going public\u2019 will only make the situation worse.

Meghan learned about her father\u2019s hospitalisation, just days before her wedding, from the TMZ report.</p> <p>Meghan later messaged her father in hospital to offer her support. \u201cI\u2019ve been reaching out to you all weekend but you\u2019re not taking any of our calls or replying to any texts \u2026 Very concerned about your health and safety and have taken every measure to protect you but not sure what more we can do if you don\u2019t respond \u2026 Do you need help? Can we send the security team down again? I\u2019m very sorry to hear you\u2019re in the hospital but need you to please get in touch with us \u2026 What hospital are you at?\u201d</p> <p>After Markle refused the offer of security guards to protect him from press intrusion, the court documents say Meghan messaged him again. \u201cHarry and I made a decision earlier today and are dispatching the same security guys you turned away this weekend to be a presence on the ground to make sure you\u2019re safe \u2026 they will be there at your disposal as soon as you need them. Please please call as soon as you can .. all of this is incredibly concerning but your health is most important.\u201d</p> <p>In the court filing, Meghan said the last contact she received from her father was a missed call at 4.57am on 19 May 2018, the morning of the wedding, and they had not been in contact since except through letter correspondence.</p> <p>The Duchess of Sussex is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\">suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday</a> for alleged invasion of privacy, breach of copyright and misuse of personal data after it published excerpts from a letter she subsequently sent to her father complaining about his treatment of her.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday argues that as a member of the royal family she did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy and that there was no agreement with her father that the letter should remain private.</p> <p>In her legal response, Meghan said the publisher of the Mail had sought to \u201cattack and intimidate her\u201d. She said she had no idea that five of her close friends had chosen to collectively cooperate with the US magazine People on a lengthy piece regarding her relationship with her father, which included references to the letter. The Mail on Sunday has previously suggested they were operating with the approval of Meghan, arguing that that meant her father had a legitimate right to reply to claims about the letter.</p> <p>Meghan\u2019s lawyers also suggest Thomas Markle claimed to have been hoodwinked into a nine-hour interview with a Mail on Sunday reporter in July 2018. Markle told his daughter in a letter: \u201cHe [the reporter] said a few things I said in confidence, but 85% were lies and bullshit!

In fact, it\u2019s the quiet plainness with which the narrative unfolds that generates the emotional impact of O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s most successful poems. Discursiveness, too, may become a mode of generosity and empathy. Over its four, seven-line stanzas, Safe Houses is widely discursive, while keeping a secretly firm hold on the design. Slowly, satisfyingly, all the threads of narrative are shown to connect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/27/lives-of-houses-review-the-enduring-appeal-of-writers-homes\">Lives of Houses review \u2013 the enduring appeal of writers' homes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It begins with the speaker confessing, neither in tones of self-mockery nor self-pity, an anxiety about losing house keys and being shut out because the door has suddenly been \u201ccaught by the wind\u201d. We might interpret this common anxiety as a perfectly rational one, but there\u2019s a metaphorical undertone to it. Everyone at some point in middle or later age becomes aware, with varying degrees of insouciant denial, of their mortality: we know we\u2019ll lose our earthly safe house, whether or not we pause first at the frightening staging-post of \u201ca home\u201d. This covert sense of impending loss isn\u2019t entirely quieted by the belt-and-braces remedies \u2013 the \u201cspare keys\u201d in \u201cseveral pockets\u201d . As the first stanza emphasises in its last line, there\u2019s a further, related anxiety for the old and single \u2013 being locked <em>inside </em>the house, beyond neighbourly help if it should be needed.</p> <p>The move in stanza two to a bigger, political context is easily accomplished by the shift of definition occasioned when \u201csafe houses\u201d loses its plural and becomes \u201csafe house\u201d. This second stanza quietly illuminates the underground code, moral as well as practical. Guerrillas change address \u201cto give their hosts a rest from listening / for the thump on the door in the early hours\u201d. A relationship between guerrilla tactics and ordinary folk going south on holiday appears somewhat oblique, but it forms a useful bridge to the next stanza\u2019s question: \u201cBut where do we retreat to in the end / when the call to open up will not subside?\u201d</p> <p>Synapses spark across the stanzas. The relentless door-rapping of the worried rescuers, an unstated but hovering scenario at the end of stanza one, and the early-morning \u201cthump\u201d of the state police in stanza two are both, however differently motivated, sounds of terror.</p> <p>And then, more than halfway through the poem\u2019s 28 lines, we meet Kate, \u201cin her nineties\u201d, now, it\u2019s delicately implied, suffering from dementia. When the narrator visits her in her care home, he\u2019s locked by the nurse into the day room with Kate and the other residents \u201cno longer fit / to mind\u201d themselves. Like the earlier knocking at the doors, the sounds evoked here are ominous, unhomely. The residents are talking in loud voices. They\u2019re not communicating with each other, though, but trying to make themselves heard by the \u201coutside world.\u201d</p> <p>Cultural references could misfire, or quench the fire, militating against the poem\u2019s immediacy. But they\u2019re managed here so as to intensify our sense of the tragic. The magpies in Dante\u2019s Purgatorio originate in Book V of Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. They were once the Pierides, <a href=\"https://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph5.htm#479128845\">losers to the Muses in a song contest</a>, punished by being transformed into magpies. They can\u2019t sing any more, only chatter nosily and complain. Masaccio\u2019s fresco, <a href=\"http://www.italianrenaissance.org/masaccios-expulsion-of-adam-and-eve-from-eden/\">The Expulsion from Eden</a> (reproduced in the anthology), vividly conveys the unseemly haste of Adam and Eve\u2019s departure, as well as their utter grief and humiliation. O\u2019Donoghue refreshes a familiar narrative with both these allusions. He conveys the plight of the old whose speech goes unheard, and develops the emotional dimension of the Fall so as to emphasise the ignorance (a kind of innocence?) of Adam and Eve. Though devastated, they are still \u201cnot grasping what they\u2019ve been exiled from\u201d.</p> <p>The Garden of Eden at least held \u201csome corner\u201d, where the serpent\u2019s presence could have been avoided. Death wasn\u2019t part of the original plan: it wasn\u2019t inevitable. But now the couple have entered time, and the serpent is always with them. It\u2019s the moment when the poem whispers a memento mori to us, the readers. Only it\u2019s so tactfully done, we might not notice until a second reading. Then the door slams behind us.

On the one hand there\u2019s the inward-looking fulfilment to be found through work (this is not my opinion, by the way, I\u2019m just summarising the literature). On the other hand there\u2019s the outward-looking, selfless fulfilment of raising a child (what the men were doing, no one knows).</p> <p>It\u2019s a tough balance to strike, everyone acknowledged, almost impossible in fact. So add into the mix the fact of being an android, and having to engage in mortal combat with a legion of mercenaries and you can understand why Charlotte Hale is literally steaming come the end of this episode of WestWorld.</p> <p>Yes, the Delos boss has had it tough this week. Not to say that it was easy before. As well as running a company dedicated to bringing out the worst in humankind, she was also working as a corporate mole for the dastardly plutocrat Serac. Then she died, but that was hardly the end of it. Reanimated as a robot, she became a mole on behalf of Dolores against Serac, only for the Frenchman to rumble her and send his trusty goons a rat-a-tat-ing her way.</p> <p>But, hang on, there\u2019s even more. Despite being a host powered by a copy of Dolores\u2019s own control unit, Hale increasingly felt more sympatico with the human she\u2019s supposed to be pretending to be. Goodness knows how it works; there\u2019s a snatch of convo between Dolores and Hale suggesting some kind of accidentally uploaded emotions, and we\u2019ll have to go with that. But suffice to say, when it comes to the crunch, in the choice between fighting Serac for the sake of Delos\u2019s corporate values, or dashing off home to save her husband and kid, she plumped for the latter. Talk about having it all.</p> <p>Sadly for Hale all that went to waste. No sooner has she returned home and uttered the words: \u201cMummy\u2019s not going to let anything happen to you\u201d, than her squat little future car explodes into a ball of flames taking hubby and progeny with it. It\u2019s an act of murderous arson that has Serac written all over it. Despite the horrible intensity of it all, however, the explosion is not nearly enough to take out Hale herself. She crawls from the wreckage looking like a tanning salon disaster, but alive; her eyes spelling out \u2018\u2018revenge\u201d.</p> <p>As Hale crouches by the roadside, hot enough to fry an egg, Maeve is in Serac\u2019s laboratory waiting to print something out. Because this is Westworld, the print job is not a 32-page guide to performing essential maintenance on the Rohohohoboam, but an actual host, about to emerge from the mystical milk and help Maeve in her fight against Dolores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf2068381a57a6bf61712f4fda2d4cb2be1bacd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2068381a57a6bf61712f4fda2d4cb2be1bacd2/204_28_1583_950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Westworld\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maeve and Hector reunite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maeve, you will recall, is on Team Serac, though the bond is hardly an unbreakable one given that the dastardly trillionaire has promised to deny her access to her daughter for eternity should she not do what she\u2019s told. Maeve spends much of this hour trying to get the gang back together for the big battle ahead. She returns to Warworld with some zingers about the necessity of foreplay and a lust for robot Nazi blood, before rallying poor deluded Hector and limping Lee Sizemore to her cause.</p> <p>Serac serves up one other character for Maeve to interact with and that\u2019s Dolores. In a reworking of all those interrogations Bernard used to make of big D in season one, Maeve quizzes a version of Dolores as to what she would do \u2013 just hypothetically speaking you understand \u2013 if she was determined to wage war on all humanity. The fake Dolores reveals that her first move would be to stop Maeve reassembling the aforementioned gang.</p> <p>Soon enough Hector has his control unit crushed by a rampaging Hale. And Sizemore is just a simulation, so he\u2019s useless. But judging by the smile on Maeve\u2019s mush, whatever\u2019s coming out of that host bath promises some useful help; whether it\u2019s a Teddy or a Clementine or maybe that Rebus dude whose muttonchops will stay with me till the grave.</p> <p>Speaking of the grave, William\u2019s still dodging it. Committed to an asylum the last time we saw him, we now find the erstwhile Man in Black being exposed to all kinds of Clockwork Orange/Marathon Man style brutality. Dressed in an all-white jumpsuit he endures some improvised dentistry (getting the same mind-bending braces fitted as Caleb) before being introduced to Dr Albert (how do they come up with these names?) who signs William up for a spot of aversion therapy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fba7f69914073be9b3d751076b8ccd037b0580b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fba7f69914073be9b3d751076b8ccd037b0580b6/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Westworld\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Mullan returns to torment William.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem with William\u2019s aversion, is that it\u2019s for himself. He absolutely loathes William, does William. Dr Albert\u2019s recommended course of treatment, therefore, is that he should sit in a room with several different versions of himself (and good old Daddy Delos to boot) and collectively thrash out their problems. Of course, William being William, the thrashings are literal and after a debate over nature versus nurture \u2013 did William\u2019s alcoholic Dad make William bad or did Bad William make his dad alcoholic? \u2013 William beats all his variant selves to death with his bare hands. No damage done though. The therapy turns out to have been all in the mind and Bernard, displaying once again his uncanny ability to turn up in the precise place where the plot needs him, detaches William from his nightmare.</p> <p>So with two episodes left in the season, Bernard is in the saddle with the Man in Black, Maeve is down the robot dairy and Hale is best served with a tomato relish. Serac meanwhile is beaming holographic versions of himself into any number of boardrooms as he looks to reassert control over the future of us all and put an end to these pesky hosts. Caleb, well, we all hope he has come down off his Genre by now and as for Dolores it\u2019s all up in the air, quite literally guys. See you next week!</p> <h2>Divergence and anomalies</h2> <p>\u2022 No popular chart music played on a violin this week, what\u2019s up with that?</p> <p>\u2022 Last week I read that driverless plastic tubs were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46045365\">delivering fast food in Milton Keynes</a>. A week later and futuristic gardeners are using them to get rid of dead bodies. I have to say, this trajectory does have an air of plausibility to it.</p> <p>\u2022 When precisely did Hale find the time in her busy schedule to secrete poison gas in the Delos boardroom?</p> <p>\u2022 Good to see one of those riot robots get an outing. All that money spend and it would have been a shame not to see them go smash something up Transformers-style.</p>",

Its protagonist, Edvard Behrends, is a high-ranking diplomat who is undertaking complex and delicate peace negotiations at a luxurious hotel in the Tyrol, confiding his thoughts on his situation to his beloved but absent wife, Anna.

  "<p>Each night, Bipul* is kept awake by the fear of loan sharks hounding his parents for the money he owes. Five months ago, the 25-year-old Sri Lankan borrowed $1,400 (\u00a31,120) to pay recruiters to take him to the United Arab Emirates, where he got a job as cleaner at a five-star hotel. But since the coronavirus outbreak there are no longer any guests, so he no longer has work and the loan is going unpaid.</p> <p>\u201cI really need a job so I can repay it,\u201d he says. \u201cI also need to earn money to help my family.

Until he was placed at a job with Accor, the brokers made him live in a room with more than 20 other men, where he slept on a mattress on the floor and was given insufficient food. After that ordeal, he was desperate for life to improve.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trapped,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel so sad and angry. But what can I do?\u201d</p> <p>The UAE is on lockdown and most hotels are shut, leaving very low paid migrant workers \u2013 mainly employed in the tourism, hospitality and construction sectors \u2013 stranded in the country with no prospect of earning. The Emirati government has allowed some repatriation flights for Asian migrant workers left jobless by the pandemic. However, some countries have refused to allow their citizens home, citing concerns over possible disease transmission, leaving workers struggling to survive without funds.</p> <p>\u201cThese are worrying reports.

One day Marx asked Gould to change a lightbulb in his bedroom. Gould took off his shoes, stood on the bed and replaced the broken bulb. Marx told him: \u201cThat was the best acting I\u2019ve ever seen you do.\u201d</p> <p>Gould, now 81, has been telling the story for decades \u2013 but it is clear even in our pixelated video call that it still delights him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great?\u201d he says, his distinctive nasal, New York baritone now deepened with age. As we speak he is sitting at a computer at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles, relaxed in a blue hoodie, with a seemingly bottomless mug of coffee before him. In isolation on either side of the Atlantic, neither of us has anywhere to be. And after more than half a century in Hollywood, in which he went from leading man to exile and, eventually, fixture \u2013 Gould could fill days, not just hours, with his stories. Even without his eight-year marriage to Barbra Streisand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9fc012f09c74f383ec15065811ebb4baa90a98b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9fc012f09c74f383ec15065811ebb4baa90a98b/0_0_3504_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould as \u2018Trapper\u2019 McIntyre (right) with Donald Sutherland\u2019s Hawkeye in M*A*S*H.

Gould admits his thinking is \u201cnot always linear\u201d. Some memories take time to retrieve: \u201cI flush it out as we\u2019re talking.\u201d But once they emerge, they are precise, both in detail and dialogue, such as his \u201clittle date\u201d with Elvis.</p> <p>Back in the 70s, Gould asked to meet Presley in his Las Vegas dressing room. They were at close quarters, Gould recalls, made all the more so by the conspicuous, gilded .45 automatic in Elvis\u2019s belt and the watchful presence of his manager, Tom \u201cThe Colonel\u201d Parker, as well as the singer\u2019s father, Vernon. It was clear to Gould that they would not let their \u201ccash cow\u201d out of their sight and he said so, urging Presley to \u201cleave \u2018Elvis\u2019 here and come out, be a free spirit\u201d. \u201cElvis says to me, with his gold gun in his belt: \u2018You\u2019re crazy, man.\u2019 I said: \u2018Elvis, I ain\u2019t crazy. I\u2019m scared, just like you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Gould was born Elliott Goldstein in Brooklyn in 1938, the only child of Bernard and Lucille \u2013 non-orthodox, working-class Jews. Their marriage was troubled (they eventually divorced after 27 years), but they were ambitious for their son, putting him through stage school.</p> <p>He was a shy, fearful child, who loved to get lost in radio dramas, Sherlock Holmes stories and Pinocchio, but struggled to express himself. His parents worried that he was slow to develop. One of his earliest memories is being told, when he was two: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to feel, and you don\u2019t know how to think, and we\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c7d08b69452ec5f06df267d48dd748e60f23df0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7d08b69452ec5f06df267d48dd748e60f23df0/0_0_1743_1300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Close to a perfect picture\u2019 ...

When I wept, he did not treat me like a baby and he got through to me.\u201d Later, the teacher gave him a copy of Webster\u2019s dictionary, to which he still routinely refers.</p> <p>In 1957, aged 19, Gould made his Broadway debut in the musical Rumple, at the Alvin theatre. \u201cIt smelled great,\u201d Gould remembers, inhaling the memory. \u201cI could go to the theatre and feel I have some place where I belong.\u201d A few small parts followed. Then, in 1961, he was cast as the leading man in the musical I Can Get It For You Wholesale, \u201cwhich was so unlikely!\u201d he says, with feeling. He sat in on the final audition of the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Barbra Streisand. Gould says he saw elements of himself in her, that same inhibition from childhood: \u201cShe presents herself the way I feel about myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49ce60e60097d1ecaae2e3c19a12254253e42719\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ce60e60097d1ecaae2e3c19a12254253e42719/0_58_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the stellar gang in Ocean\u2019s Eleven.

Gould goes quiet and I wonder if our video connection has cut out. Then he says: \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, are you kidding?\u201d After her audition, Streisand gave him her phone number aloud; Gould memorised it, and called her. Streisand invited him to see her sing but he declined. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re so good, I think you\u2019re going to be in the show \u2013 we\u2019ll see if we get to know one another then.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Streisand was cast as Gould\u2019s character\u2019s secretary, Miss Marmelstein; the part was enlarged to do her justice. Shortly after the play closed in early 1963, after a stellar run of 300 performances, the pair married. A year later Streisand was the toast of the business in Funny Girl, with an album at No 1. Gould has likened their marriage to both a souffle and a \u201cbath of lava\u201d. Streisand has been working on a book for some time, says Gould, and will often call him to draw on his recollections. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t spin. It\u2019s so precious to me, that it has to be absolutely right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9706d80de5d9b361fa13ee816fb41409c5304f4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9706d80de5d9b361fa13ee816fb41409c5304f4b/0_80_2528_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould with Barbra Streisand and Jack Kruschen in the 1962 Broadway play I Can Get it For You Wholesale.

They divorced in 1971, five years after the birth of their son Jason and following a two-year separation. Streisand later called Gould to ask why they had grown apart. He told her: \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow together, and you made yourself more important than us, and all I care about is us. We made it very fast, and no one has what we have.\u201d But, today Gould says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t play the part. I had to be able to find myself, to be able to be myself. I couldn\u2019t let myself live in a mould.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, Gould starred in Paul Mazursky\u2019s wife-swap comedy Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice. His performance secured him his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. A string of hits followed: Robert Altman\u2019s M*A*S*H, in which Gould cast himself as Trapper John McIntyre, and the student protest film Getting Straight. It was around this time that he got his second-best review \u2013 from Muhammad Ali, who told him: \u201cYou do what you do as well as I do what I do.\u201d</p> <p>In 1970, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as \u201cthe star for an uptight age\u201d for his (as he explains it now) \u201cunexpected success\u201d at a time of political upheaval. Later I ask him if the current US administration causes him some distress. \u201c<em>Some</em> distress? Oh my goodness,\u201d he replies, pulling his hands down over his eyes theatrically. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that and it\u2019s not just him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d715129e9c45e1afbd5c97a519d147f76000e9c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d715129e9c45e1afbd5c97a519d147f76000e9c7/0_97_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould, Natalie Wood, Robert Culp and Dyan Cannon in Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice.

He says he intends to study politics more, though he seems to avoid talking about it where possible. Shooting the 2013 television drama Ray Donovan with Jon Voight, a Trump supporter, Gould told him: \u201cNo politics, Jon.\u201d (When they work together \u201cit can be like Laurel and Hardy on acid,\u201d he adds.) He recalls a similarly loaded phone conversation with Jack Nicholson, who said to him: \u201cI love being American, Ell.\u201d Gould agreed, making reference to Canada and Mexico. Nicholson shouted back: \u201cNo, no, no! Just America!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought: \u2018Gee, that\u2019s rather Trumpish, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Diversity is essential to me. It\u2019s essential to all of us.\u201d</p> <p>In 1971, Gould was still cresting the wave and had just returned from Sweden, where he shot The Touch: the first English-language film for legendary director Ingmar Bergman. The director has largely dismissed the picture, but Gould was honoured to be chosen as his first non-Scandinavian leading man and sees working with the demanding director as a transformative moment. He recalls: \u201cBergman said to me, outside a 2,000-year-old church near Stockholm: \u2018You\u2019ve gone beyond your limits and you\u2019ll have to live more to understand what you\u2019ve done.\u2019 \u201cAt that moment, I didn\u2019t know limits.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51bc1761100c2d3587f4642efc2fef9f4a28edbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51bc1761100c2d3587f4642efc2fef9f4a28edbb/0_0_1850_2732/677.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018As much as I love to win, I hate losing more\u2019 ...

The 1974 drama California Split, said by some to be the best film about gambling ever made, was semi-autobiographical. Decades later, spending time in casinos for Ocean\u2019s Eleven, Gould says he realised those days were behind him: \u201cAs much as I love to win, I hate losing more, and there\u2019s nothing I need that I can win.\u201d</p> <p>He has always denied ever having had a drug problem: on national television, in 1988; on the phone to Streisand (his response, in summary: \u201cBullshit\u201d); and to me. \u201cI had a reality problem,\u201d is his oft-repeated quip. \u201cOf course I smoked marijuana. I don\u2019t do that now, because I\u2019m centred and balanced and I don\u2019t want to alter that.\u201d As for \u201cmind-expanding drugs\u201d \u2013 mescaline, psilocybin, acid \u2013 Gould says: \u201cI had some experience with that and did some work behind it.\u201d He remembers telling Bergman (then in his 50s) about it. \u201cHe said it was interesting to him, but that he felt he did not want to do it at that time.\u201d Was that experimentation part of his pushing back against directors? \u201cNo. No. No! But still, I saw too much \u2013 I knew too much.\u201d</p> <p>After making The Touch, Gould says he \u201cshould have stayed out of work for a while\u201d. Instead, in 1971, he took on A Glimpse of Tiger as co-producer and star. The film was never made (though it was later retooled as What\u2019s Up, Doc?, starring Streisand), but its story is infamous. Just five days in, production was shut down, following reports of Gould\u2019s erratic behaviour and power struggles. His co-star Kim Darby was so frightened of him that security was hired. Gould says now that he tried to reassure Darby that he was \u201creally very sweet\u201d and that she could ask for \u201ctime out\u201d at any time \u2013 \u201cbut it couldn\u2019t work that way\u201d. Of his attempt to undermine the director, Anthony Harvey, he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t communicate and I behaved very badly.\u201d</p> <p>Gould says he was \u201cnot sufficiently developed\u201d to harness his newfound vision and naive about the demands of a production. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t compromise. I couldn\u2019t. And I had to find out for myself, taking a chance, not knowing if I would ever get back. It\u2019s pretty fabulous, to take the chance \u2026 and not be enslaved to one\u2019s success,\u201d he says. But the financial toll on Gould was significant and the fallout so disastrous that he was considered unfit to work for two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77cc05fa7a44107d6fd643d4fb6c6aedae98adc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77cc05fa7a44107d6fd643d4fb6c6aedae98adc8/0_96_1819_1091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould as Philip Marlowe in Altman\u2019s The Long Goodbye.

The studio insisted that he take a psychiatric test, as well as the standard physical. Gould says Altman\u2019s faith extended to allowing him to improvise a scene where Marlowe paints his face with inky fingerprints at a police station. \u201cIt exhibited the confidence and trust that Altman had in me, because it would have taken 25 minutes to clean me up.\u201d</p> <p> The same year he married the actor Jenny Bogart.

Looking back, Gould says it would be \u201cdisloyal\u201d to other crew members to regret any film he has worked on. \u201cSometimes things work, sometimes things don\u2019t work, and we learn from it.\u201d Even the 1978 Matilda, playing opposite a man in a cheap and unsettling kangaroo suit? He is tickled by the memory. \u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p> <p> We have been talking for three hours; even Gould is surprised that there is still coffee left in his mug.

  "<p>The heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies have issued a graphic warning of the risk of coronavirus to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors had pledged around a quarter of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/funding-fight-against-covid-19-world%E2%80%99s-poorest-countries\">$2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response in March.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/humanitarian-dispatches/an-urgent-call-to-fund-the-global-emergency-supply-system-to-fight-covid-19-ea063658f7d9\">In an open letter</a> shared before publication with the Guardian, the world\u2019s most senior emergencies, health and development officials, warned that help for the world\u2019s weakest countries was in everyone\u2019s \u201cinterest to stop the virus from spreading unchecked, destroying lives and economies, and continuing to circle around the world\u201d.</p> <p>In particular, the agency heads are calling for $350m to be specifically earmarked for the establishment of a rapidly enhanced and expanded UN global logistics system, including key regional hubs, to serve as air and cargo bridges to move key personnel and equipment as conventional air traffic has shut down, or movement has been restricted.</p> <p>The plan envisages using two air transport centres in Europe \u2013 still accessible by commercial flights \u2013 to then transport aid staff on charter to key crisis areas, including the Middle East and Africa, as well as the provision of seven field hospitals around the world dedicated to treating humanitarian workers who fall sick with the disease while working.</p> <p>The plan mirrors early discussions among some European countries in recent days to set up their own humanitarian air bridge via the EU\u2019s civil protection coordination mechanism.</p> <p>Amid mounting concern that countries in the developing world with the least ability to contain coronavirus could become reservoirs for the disease, driving new waves of the virus around the planet, the letter adds that without a stepped up effort \u201cthe global response could stutter to a halt\u201d.</p> <p>The call followed mounting concern both inside the UN system and among prominent NGOs of the devastating impact of coronavirus on the countries already vulnerable and heavily dependent on international aid because of high poverty, widespread social insecurity or conflict.</p> <p>The letter is signed by the heads of the World Food Programme, World Health Organization, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UN Refugee Agency and International Organisation for Migration, among others, as well as by Mark Lowcock, the UN\u2019s emergency relief coordinator.</p> <p>Describing the latest funding appeal, Lowcock underlined that full funding for the logistics effort was critical to the UN\u2019s Covid-19 mitigation efforts. \u201cIf the world does not step up for this, nothing else happens,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Lowcock described the situation in Yemen in particular \u2013 where the UN is already desperately short of funds \u2013 as an example of a worst-case scenario.</p> <p>\u201cThe most difficult place is Yemen, partly for funding reasons. We feed 13 million people there every month but are in process of closing 31 of 40 main programmes over the next several weeks.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t keep getting supplies in and out there\u2019s going to be a huge tragedy. Central African Republic is also difficult as is Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal for a joined-up global response followed months in which countries have largely forged their own paths as many global political institutions \u2013 including those of the EU \u2013 have struggled to find consensus.</p> <p>Describing coronavirus as the \u201cmost daunting challenge facing humanity since the second world war\u201d, the letters adds: \u201cCoronavirus knows no borders, spares no country or continent, and strikes indiscriminately.</p> <p>\u201cIn this race against an invisible enemy, all countries must fight back but not all begin from the same starting line. In countries where the world\u2019s most vulnerable need humanitarian aid and supplies to beat back the pandemic, cancelled flights and disrupted supply routes hit disproportionately hard.</p> <p>\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interest to stop the virus from spreading unchecked, destroying lives and economies, and continuing to circle around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Lowcock added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about compassion and empathy it\u2019s about hard self interest. Nobody is going to be safe, until everyone is safe. The places [where] humanitarian agencies work are potentially huge reservoirs where it is hard to mange the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The letter followed the appeal launched by the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on 25 March amid the escalating global economic meltdown prompted by the pandemic. However, it revealed that despite the appeal for $2bn only $550m has so far been pledged.</p> <p>It also came just a week after Donald Trump\u2019s suspension of funding to the WHO, the main UN agency leading the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>One of the most pressing concerns has been the devastating impact of the collapse of commercial aviation relied on by humanitarian organisations in places like Africa to move staff and supplies, requiring UN\u2019s World Food Programme to massively expand its transport and logistics services \u2013 including its UN Humanitarian Air Service \u2013 which is available to all aid professionals, which itself requires an extra $350m.</p> <p>Chris Lockyear, international secretary general of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, said that, like many agencies, MSF was involved in a \u201crace against time with the pandemic\u201d even as it had been forced to shut down programmes across the world.</p> <p>\u201cTime is fundamental. We have already seen how devastating this disease is in places with highly developed health expertise and security. If the consequences have been devastating in Europe and the US imagine what we are looking at in places with perhaps only a handful of doctors.\u201d</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-threatens-to-turn-aid-crises-into-humanitarian-catastrophes\">Guardian reported last month</a> officials and experts are concerned not only with the impact of the disease in developing countries but of the knock-on effect in pre-existing emergencies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/01/afghanistan-braces-for-coronavirus-surge-as-migrants-pour-back-from-iran\">in places such as Afghanistan</a>, Syria, Yemen and Zimbabwe, where humanitarian supply lines to hugely vulnerable populations are already extremely fragile.</p>",

Emphasis ours:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our supply-chain group has worked around the clock to secure gowns, gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators. These employees have adapted to a new normal, exploring every lead, no matter how unusual. <strong>Deals, some bizarre and convoluted, and many involving large sums of money, have dissolved at the last minute when we were outbid or outmuscled, sometimes by the federal government.</strong> Then we got lucky, but getting the supplies was not easy.</p> \n   <p>A lead came from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member. After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker\u2019s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds \u2013 more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers \u2013 we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. <strong>I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.</strong></p> \n   <p>Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system\u2019s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. <strong>But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE.</strong> Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9caef48f080ee110447e18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T20:11:37.245Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A number of US governors from both sides of the aisle, including Virginia Democrat Ralph Northam and Maryland Republican Larry Hogan, have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures. </p> \n  <p>As the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe and Edward Helmore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-governors-trump-making-delusional-comments\">report</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Many state leaders have said they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s recommended <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\">three-phrase programme</a> to ease stay-at-home restrictions without a robust and widespread system of testing in place.</p> \n   <p>Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US should conduct more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\">New York Times reported</a>.</p> \n   <p>Democratic Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN on Sunday that claims by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were \u201cjust delusional\u201d.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe have been fighting for testing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have enough swabs, believe it or not.

Some of the money went to <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/coronavirus-relief-ruth-chris-steak-house\">successful large companies</a>, while many small businesses received nothing.</p> \n  <p>Mnuchin concurs with Pelosi that a new funding deal is close, and tells Tapper it could be signed off by the middle of this week.
