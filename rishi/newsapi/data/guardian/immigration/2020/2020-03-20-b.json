Rationing is already taking place unofficially in supermarkets but in a way that takes no account of people\u2019s need, he has told Downing Street along with fellow authors, Prof Erik Millstone of Sussex University, and Prof Terry Marsden of Cardiff University. </p> \n  <p>They warn that food banks and food share schemes that give food to those on low incomes are reporting serious shortages, while key workers who can only shop at the end of their shifts are finding shelves empty and nothing to eat. </p> \n  <p>Lang said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am aware of at least one London borough where the food bank has alerted the council of serious shortages despite an 80% rise in visitors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The food bank was unable to source food and essentials such as tinned meat and vegetables, long-life milk, and toiletries such as toilet paper and soap even though it had funding to buy them. </p> \n  <p>Kris Gibbon-Walsh, head of operations at Fareshare, a charity that supplies food manufacturing and retail surplus to charities that would usually feed 1 million people a week, said it too was struggling to get supplies. He called for the government to step in immediately with funding and mandatory allocation of supplies:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have more demand than ever, and some of it is different demand \u2013 people who can\u2019t go to food banks or might be self-isolating, people who might have eaten at a lunch club for the elderly before. Government needs to instruct industry to keep supplying us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The experts\u2019 letter to the prime minister says \u201cthere is a dangerous tendency to blame consumers\u201d and that the problems only arise because of panic-buying. In the absence of clearer planning, with market mechanisms failing, consumers are only acting rationally in preparing for being confined at home, the authors add. </p> \n  <p>Before coronavirus struck, nearly 8bn meals a year in the UK were being eaten out of home. Suddenly people are having to make nearly all their meals at home.<br></p> \n  <p>Gibbon-Walsh said supermarkets were struggling to adapt their algorithms quickly enough. These limit the amount delivered to stores to the amount of shelf space, number of people available to stack them, and number of drivers, so even though retailers have surplus at distribution centres, they cannot get it to stores to meet current demand.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T15:37:39.089Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e74de148f08a08573fbe6d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T15:18:03.248Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Parking app JustPark has launched a nationwide appeal to increase the number of <strong>free parking spaces near hospitals</strong> by allowing the general public to list spaces for free via their app. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustPark/status/1240994749139562497\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NHS</a> needs your help!

Like anyone else in France stopped by police without documentation to justify their presence outside their homes, rail passengers will face a fine of \u20ac135 (\u00a3123).

</figure>  <p><strong>Sunflowers, 1888, by Vincent Van Gogh</strong><br>Coronavirus has closed most museums and galleries in the UK, but some works of art are so vibrant they blaze even as reproductions. The rugged surface of Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers, as if scarred by the passion with which he loaded each brush stroke, gives this painting a substantial and organic presence that can be felt almost as strongly on the National Gallery\u2019s website as in its real presence. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/28/van-goghs-sunflowers-under-coronavirus-quarantine-in-tokyo\">The Sunflowers were put under quarantine in Tokyo in late February</a>, as part of 60 masterpieces on tour.) It would be fatuous right now to show some escapist summer scene as a pick-me-up. Van Gogh\u2019s joy in these yellow flowers, however, has a hard-won, desperate quality. He painted them soon after fleeing Paris, where drink and despair were killing him, for the south of France. He found a little house he liked in Arles, and painted a series of sunflower decorations all saturated, this one perhaps most of all, with his sheer wonder at a southern light and heat he\u2019d never experienced before.

  "<p>Tiger King, a new Netflix docuseries resulting from a five-year odyssey that fully earns the term wild, started, perhaps surprisingly, in the reptile world. In 2014, Eric Goode, a film-maker and longtime conservationist, was looking into a notorious snake dealer in south Florida when a stranger mentioned, off-hand, \u201ccheck out what I just bought\u201d. There\u2019s a collective \u201coh shit\u201d when he slides open his van to reveal a snow leopard resting in a cage, in 100F heat. \u201cIt just blew my mind: what is a snow leopard doing in the back of this guy\u2019s van?\u201d Goode says early in episode one. \u201cThat set me on this journey to really understand what is going on with people keeping big cats in this country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/19/after-truth-hbo-fake-news-pizzagate-documentary\">After Truth: how ordinary people are 'radicalized' by fake news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If only it stayed that simple. Over the next five years (and seven 45-minute episodes), Goode and co-director Rebecca Chaiklin followed the thread of private big cat ownership in the US \u2013 a disturbing if fascinating topic in and of itself \u2013 down a rabbit hole including, in no particular order: a murder-for-hire plot of a rival big cat owner, a theory that said owner fed her millionaire husband to tigers (there\u2019s no evidence to support this, though the husband\u2019s children from a previous marriage have aired the claim in local media), a guru-led harem based around an exotic animal park in Myrtle Beach, an accidental gun death and a federal sentence for animal abuse. That\u2019s aside from the astounding fact that there are more privately owned tigers in the US (somewhere between 5,000 to 10,000) than in the wild (fewer than 4,000), kept as pets or in side-of-the-highway wildlife menageries.</p> <p>But all that comes later, as Goode and Chaiklin follow the descent of one of the most notorious tiger owners in the US: Joe Maldonado-Passage, professionally known as <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/joe-exotic-a-dark-journey-into-the-world-of-a-man-gone-wild/\">Joe Exotic</a>, who ran a 16-acre private zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, with dozens of tigers, plus lions, bears and alligators. The film-makers first learned of Joe, an attention-loving eccentric with a bleached mullet, piercings and a penchant for leopard-print outfits, through Carole Baskin, operator of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Florida, and Joe\u2019s philosophical opposite. She had \u201ca hitlist of \u2018bad guys\u2019\u201d, recalled Chaiklin via email. \u201cAnd Joe was her No 1 bad guy\u201d as a prominent breeder of tigers for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/11/tigers-in-the-united-states-outnumber-those-in-the-wild-feature/\">cub petting</a>\u201d, a cottage industry in which people pay for photos with baby tigers, which grow to be unmanageable after about 12 weeks and are then frequently discarded, mistreated or euthanized. \u201cCarole was completely obsessed with Joe, which naturally made us quite curious about him,\u201d said Chaiklin. They reached out, and soon were filming in Wynnewood, about an hour north of the Texas border.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acTdxsoa428\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/acTdxsoa428?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Joe loved the publicity (\u201cJoe loved being on camera more than just about anything,\u201d said Chaiklin), his husbands (of which there have been several, sometimes overlapping, throughout the series\u2019s five-year timeline), and his YouTube and TV channels. But he hated Baskin, who he accused of feeding her husband to tigers in the late 1990s and who had successfully petitioned malls across the country from hosting his cub petting shows. \u201cThe feud between Carole and Joe and their obsession with each other was quite comedic at first \u2013 it had a very best in show feeling to it,\u201d said Chaiklin. But there was no end to the escalation \u2013 as documented in the show\u2019s early episodes, Joe frequently and crudely mocked Baskin in his broadcasts, threatening to set venomous snakes on her and even shooting a dummy of her in the head.</p> <p>And then, in September 2018, in the middle of the Tiger King project, he was arrested on charges of hiring two hitmen to kill Baskin. \u201cThis story is a film-maker\u2019s dream in how it evolved narratively,\u201d said Chaiklin. \u201cHowever, when you spend a lot of time filming with people, you get to know them quite well. So on a human level it was quite difficult to process some of the unexpected twists it took.\u201d Some of Joe\u2019s commentary in the series is taped from jail phone calls; in January 2020, he was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/animal-news/wildlife-park-owner-joe-exotic-sentenced-22-years-plot-kill-n1120566\">sentenced to 22 years in federal prison</a> for the Baskin plot and various wildlife violations.</p> <p>Still, Joe Exotic\u2019s fall from self-proclaimed Tiger King to prison is but one of several absurd threads in the series, in part because the world of big cat ownership in the US is isolated, unregulated and propagated by cults of personality. \u201cAll of these characters check out of mainstream life,\u201d said Goode via email. \u201cThey have created their own individual universes \u2013 little \u2018utopias\u2019 \u2013 along with their own set of rules, which ultimately was Joe\u2019s greatest downfall.\u201d For example, Goode and Chaiklin interview Bhagavan \u201cDoc\u201d Antle, a polygamous, guru-styled owner of Myrtle Beach Safari who has <a href=\"http://iowainformer.com/commentary/2017/03/bhagavan-doc-antle-rolling-stone-tigers/?fbclid=IwAR2Z5L_Xyl6rhDRBhZn_BxMzzre7Zp9GFTtJUS6HJnRZVjoaq_Qg4MPKDwQ\">been accused by a former long</a><a href=\"http://iowainformer.com/commentary/2017/03/bhagavan-doc-antle-rolling-stone-tigers/?fbclid=IwAR2Z5L_Xyl6rhDRBhZn_BxMzzre7Zp9GFTtJUS6HJnRZVjoaq_Qg4MPKDwQ\">time employee</a> of running a cult, and by Joe Exotic of euthanizing tiger cubs once they outgrow petting (he has denied these accusations; his compound was raided by federal agents in December 2019); Jeff Lowe, a former Joe Exotic business partner and con artist who took over and dismantled the Wynnewood zoo; and Tim Stark, a former Lowe partner and private zoo owner in southern Indiana who is <a href=\"https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/state-moves-to-restrict-access-to-big-cats-in-charlestown-zoo\">also under investigation</a> for animal cruelty.

In typical American fashion, regulation of the ownership of big cats such as tigers and lions is scant and confusing, varying state by state or even county by county. States such as Oklahoma have almost no regulations. \u201cIn some places there are more regulations on keeping a pet dog than a pet tiger,\u201d said Chaiklin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dissimilar to guns \u2013 you can buy an AR-15 in Oklahoma and you can buy a tiger in Oklahoma easily,\u201d said Goode of an unwillingness of state and federal governments to wade into private wildlife regulations. A federal bill to impose much stricter rules on private ownership of big cats, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1380\">Big Cat Public Safety Act</a>, has not passed Congress.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear, even after just an hour of Tiger King, that there\u2019s an intoxicating allure to big cats \u2013 a force that draws visitors to lucrative private zoos, turns keepers into fanatics and beckons viewers deeper and deeper into what can seem like an alternate reality. In Tiger King, reality is stranger than fiction and the characters larger than life, their morality, and culpability in Joe Exotic\u2019s fall, is up to viewer discretion. \u201cI hope we have told this story in such a way that the audience will arrive to their own conclusions,\u201d said Goode, while \u201cultimately \u2026 recognizing that the real victims in this story are the cats\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tiger King is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Homeless people were left sleeping on the streets in Glasgow on Thursday night when a shelter had to close after a staff member and a service user tested positive for coronavirus, according to a head of a homeless charity in the city.</p> <p>The head of Glasgow City Mission said he was given assurances that people would not be left without shelter, but understood some people with insecure immigration status or complex background issues were not accommodated.</p> <p>Glasgow city council disputed the claim and said no vulnerable people were refused accommodation, but the Guardian understands that individuals who the council did not have a statutory duty to accommodate were not put up.</p> <p>The council added that it had secured temporary accommodation so that homeless people in the city would be able to self-isolate.</p> <p>Charles Maasz, CEO of Glasgow City Mission, tweeted on Thursday night: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GlasgowMission/status/1240780205003878400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tragically disappointing tonight. <br>Against all words, calls, messages, and indications to the contrary that I had been given.

Under the current framework some people we consider vulnerable will present but the council won\u2019t be able to house them. That is why we have to change the current framework in these extraordinary times and we want to work the council and other city partners to find a solution.\u201d</p> <p>He said the charity had been given assurances by Glasgow\u2019s health and social care partnership that all homeless people would be housed, and was bitterly disappointed that this appeared not to be the case.</p> <p>The centre, which is usually open between December and March and can accommodate up to 40 people, had to shut in light of social distancing guidance because guests slept in one room.</p> <p>Thursday was to be its last night open, but after consulting with the Scottish government it closed during the day. In a statement on Thursday, the charity said: \u201cThere are a significant number of highly vulnerable persons in our city whose status provides no recourse to public funds who will also require immediate attention and accommodation. To wilfully continue to house people in shelter-style environments is, for us, to demonstrate contempt not compassion.</p> <p>\u201cTo continue to allow mass sleeping in the face of advice to the contrary is to put vulnerable people at significant intentional risk, while on the face of it keeps many onlookers satisfied that \u2018at least they are not out in the cold\u2019. It is, in our mind, a case of out of sight is out of mind. We cannot do that in good conscience.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Wray, the head of projects at Glasgow City Mission, said people with no recourse to public funds were highly vulnerable. \u201cWe believe that it is a matter of public health that all individuals who are homeless, whether they have access to public funds or not, should be accommodated by the local authority. Last night this did not happen. We will continue to urge our partners in the HSCP to provide accommodation for all who are forced to sleep rough,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Peter Krykant, until recently a street outreach worker who plans to launch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/glasgow-activist-risks-arrest-to-set-up-drug-consumption-room-in-a-van\">a safer injecting van</a>, said: \u201cI hope the government or the city council will step up today to house these people and give them the support that they need and a fighting chance against this virus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this virus hits this community, it will devastate it.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Glasgow\u2019s health and social care partnership said: \u201cGlasgow city health and social care partnership has put in place contingency plans to reduce risk to vulnerable homeless people, many of whom have underlying health conditions.\u201d</p> <p>She added that it was working with key people in police, housing and health as well as third sector partners such as the Simon Community. \u201cWe\u2019ve secured an array of temporary accommodation that will also people to self-isolate if necessary,\u201d she said.</p>",

The problem is low-income countries are probably arriving on the third wave, after China, after Europe. Access to tests is going to be problematic,\u201d said Blanchet.</p> <p>While many richer countries were currently focused on their own populations and economies, the humanitarian community would have to look at changing the way it works, said the experts, by investing in the strengthening of worldwide public health systems rather than focusing on single-issue campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just about providing services in a refugee site or a conflict-affected area, this is really about the fundamental of health systems and about health-seeking and health-protecting behaviour across entire countries,\u201d said Konyndyk. \u201cThat is not something that we in the humanitarian sector are always terribly well set up for.\u201d</p> <p>Konyndyk said the sector would have to work more with governments and local organisations, who have the trust of the communities with which they work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/community-infections-could-happen-any-time-kenya-prepares-for-covid-19-coronavirus\">'Community infections could happen any time': Kenya prepares for Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Virginie Lef\u00e8vre, programme and partnerships coordinator with the Lebanese NGO Amel Association, said she was already seeing examples of local workers leading the way.</p> <p>\u201cThe locally-led response, the community-based initiatives are working despite the fear.

  "<p>A 26-year-old on the Isle of Man has been arrested for allegedly failing to self-isolate against coronavirus.</p> <p>The man was held by police on the island on Thursday, two days after the self-governing British crown dependency announced strict measures to prevent the illness spreading.</p> <p>Since Tuesday night, anyone arriving on the island is subject to 14 days of self-isolation even if they do not have symptoms of the virus. It is thought the man had just arrived on the island on a ferry.</p> <p>The man, who has not been named, will appear in court in Douglas, the island\u2019s capital, on Friday. He faces a fine of up to \u00a310,000 and a possible three-month jail sentence.</p> <p>Earlier on Friday, the Manx government confirmed the island\u2019s first case of coronavirus. A spokesperson for the island\u2019s public health team confirmed that the person had recently returned from a trip to Spain.</p> <p>So far, 52 people have been tested for the virus on the Isle of Man, which has a population of 85,000. The island\u2019s population has an average age of 44.4, compared with <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/\">40.5 in the UK</a>.</p> <p>Implementing its tight quarantine rules on Monday, the Isle of Man\u2019s chief minister, Howard Quayle, said: \u201cWe are taking action to protect our residents and to ensure life can continue as normal as possible during this unpredictable time.</p> <p>\u201cWe are advising against all non-essential travel off the island, and the measures being introduced from tomorrow are aimed at minimising the risk of those arriving in the island infecting our population.\u201d</p> <p>For those already on the island, anyone displaying symptoms including a persistent cough or fever, or anyone living with someone who has symptoms of the virus, must also self-isolate for two weeks.</p> <p>The island\u2019s schools and businesses are still open, and there are no restrictions on public gatherings, but the government has urged people to take extra precautions if they are in an at-risk category.</p> <p>In the UK, there are no active measures at present to enforce self-isolation, and guidance on self-isolation is less trenchant.</p> <p>Anyone displaying symptoms has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/18/what-is-uk-government-advice-on-social-distancing-and-isolation-coronavirus\">advised to stay at home for at least seven days</a> from when they started. Those in households with multiple people must self-isolate for 14 days.</p> <p>The guidance for travellers is that only those who have returned from affected areas should self-isolate; they must do this even if they do not have symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>However, on Thursday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced new legislation which would give powers to law enforcement agencies to curb the spread of the virus. Under the bill, police and immigration officials would be able to place people in \u201cappropriate isolation facilities\u201d.</p> <p>The Manx health service has an agreement with the UK whereby patients are flown over for treatment they cannot get on the island, but this could be made difficult if the NHS becomes overwhelmed.</p> <p>The island\u2019s economy, which relies heavily on tourism, has already been hit by the pandemic, with people working in the hospitality sector losing their jobs because of holiday cancellations.</p> <p>The 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-sport-a-list-of-the-major-cancellations\">Isle of Man TT </a>\u2013 which attracted 46,000 people to the island <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-49774231\">last year</a> \u2013 has been cancelled because of concerns about the spread of coronavirus. </p>",

  "<p>I started ice skating when I was four. Initially, I was just tagging along with my sister, but soon enough the sport became my entire life. In 2004, when I was 10, I won the Moscow Championships and I was a candidate to become a \u201cmaster of sport\u201d \u2013 a Russian title for international champions who have made valuable contributions to sport. I was told that I had what it took to become a professional and even take part in the Olympics. I didn\u2019t go to school, because I had to train for up to six hours a day. All of my friends were ice skaters; it was the only thing I knew.</p> <p>When I was 12, puberty kicked in. I started menstruating and my body changed rapidly. Even though I was just an average teenager, I knew right away that there would be a chance my body would prevent me from being the best skater I could be. With a bigger body, I would no longer be able to do some of the complicated jumps that are necessary for competitions. Besides, in ice skating, a slim, childish body is the beauty standard. A curvy body is not.</p> <p>Training was tough: I had to follow a strict diet. For every kilo I gained, I had to run extra kilometres on top of my usual 15km. My body was being pushed to extremes. I ruined my knees trying to lose weight, but my body never went back to its prepubescent state, despite all the effort.</p> <p>At this point, I was advised to take medication that would block the production of hormones: I would stop menstruating, my breasts would stop growing \u2013 and I would keep my young, slim body. I never questioned it. In Russia, it is widely known that young ice skaters use hormone blockers to keep their bodies from changing. In most cases, taking the hormone blockers works \u2013 although there are always side-effects, such as problems with your nervous system and your heart, that no one really talks about.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that the professional ice skating judges are explicitly sexist for not liking a voluptuous female body: the weight of your breasts really does affect your jumps. But many young girls are pushed to a point at which they have to quit the sport entirely; they literally break their bodies. All the older professional skaters have metal screws and plates in their bodies, because they have been ruined by competing. My sister is 25 years old and has fake knees.</p> <p>In my case, the drugs backfired \u2013 they had the opposite effect to the one intended. I took them for only three months, but my breasts grew rapidly and I gained 36kg (5st 9lb) in six months. I never got back to my normal body. There was no longer any chance of me competing at the highest level, so I quit ice skating altogether.</p> <p>Losing everything I had fought for caused me to sink into a deep depression for most of my teenage years. It also meant that, aged 14, I had to go to school for the first time. It was harsh. I was bullied a lot and people called me fat all the time. It wasn\u2019t even something I was mad about: in Russia, it is normal to scold someone for being overweight.</p> <p>Eventually, I realised I could get out of my depression only by redefining who I was and no longer focusing on my weight. I decided to start educating myself; I learned Spanish and went to law school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/06/experience-ive-been-protesting-for-seven-decades\">Experience: I\u2019ve been protesting for seven decades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Russia, there is no system in place to create a healthy sports environment for children. Some figures within ice skating have started publicly criticising these medications, but there was nothing in place to protect me.</p> <p>I am now a coach myself. I teach only children who skate to improve their health, not those who do so with the intention of becoming professionals. Also, ice skating is an expensive sport: if you want to train with a renowned coach, you have to pay thousands of pounds a month. But the kids who need these classes for their health usually don\u2019t have a lot of money, so my lessons are very cheap.</p> <p>I am thankful that this happened to me, and that I was young enough to turn my focus to something other than sport, so I could become the best version of myself.</p> <p><strong>\u2022</strong>As told to Djanlissa Pringels</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

I can\u2019t tell if we can get paid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have enough to pay my rent this month. After that, I don\u2019t know.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone\u2019s in the same situation. All my students are at home. That\u2019s a big problem. I stay in touch with my private students and give them work to do at home to stay motivated. But it\u2019s hard. Every single muscle feels different when you\u2019re on the ice. It\u2019s hard for me to work out properly, too. I have a solo program coming up and have to be able to do triple jumps. I have enough to pay my rent this month. After that, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just praying we\u2019ll be back to work and back on the ice.</p> <h2>Rebecca Leigh Silverman, 38, Brooklyn<br>Bartender</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"85610c525a943fd8ae53830da5989972483bddea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85610c525a943fd8ae53830da5989972483bddea/0_0_5464_3643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Leigh Silverman poses for a portrait in her neighborhood in Crown Heights.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br>I\u2019ve been working as a bartender at a cocktail bar, Dirty Precious, since 2017. I\u2019m a mixologist, which is like cooking in front of an audience, sometimes using eight or 10 ingredients for a cocktail. I\u2019ve been in this industry since I was 21, and it\u2019s the best bar/restaurant I\u2019ve ever worked in. It\u2019s been my full-time job. I work four nights a week, eight to 10 hours a night. The owner\u2019s really hands-on. She and I have been having an ongoing conversation about it and Sunday, we ultimately decided that closing was the right thing to do. Right after we decided, the governor put out the mandate saying we all had to close anyway.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve been trying to file for unemployment since Monday.

But even though I worked last week, I would say I had an 80% income drop. Which is scary to think that even if we can reopen, I won\u2019t have anything set aside for when things usually slow down in summer. I\u2019ve been trying to file for unemployment since Monday. The website just keeps crashing. Looks like there may be a little bit of outside help.</p> <p>A bartender association opened up to non-member bartenders to be able to apply for some relief, and Jameson\u2019s just donated $500,000 to that fund, which is lovely of them. Also I read that the mayor announced they\u2019re going to put a hold on people getting evicted due to lack of payment in the next couple of months, and I believe the same with utilities, which makes me feel safer knowing that.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never not paid my rent and utility bill \u2013 even when I lived below the poverty line as a professional dancer. But then there\u2019s just this, in New York City, the bar is a community gathering place. It\u2019s where you go when you\u2019re bored. It\u2019s where you go when you want to celebrate. It\u2019s where you go when you\u2019re sad. It\u2019s just where you go.

It helps knowing we\u2019re going to be able to provide the some quality of service for clients online.</p> <p>As far as being compensated, the company\u2019s taking the average of our two pay periods for February, and they say that\u2019s what they\u2019ll be giving us for however long this thing lasts. So that helps. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s going to solve everything. I\u2019m going to have to hustle for more clients. But while I will still be working hard to keep my side business with private clients, what I get from the gym is going to help me stay afloat.

  "<p>There isn\u2019t a single part of the music industry that won\u2019t be affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The most obvious are the high profile festival cancellations like Glastonbury and Coachella, and the big stars who are having to postpone tours. But beneath them there is an entire infrastructure of aspiring musicians, session players, sound engineers, booking agents, record shop owners, DJs, labels, tour managers, event staff and more whose livelihoods are at risk with venues closing their doors, and with Boris Johnson saying venues can stay open but advising people to stay away, fear in the industry quickly turned to anger.

At the shows, there was this weird unity. Everyone was a bit scared, but there was this feeling of: we\u2019re all going to be in a room together and we\u2019re going to enjoy being out. The thing I really struggled with was not being able to interact physically with my fans. My music is very emotional and honest and comes from a deep place, and the people listening to it have maybe had those experiences, too. So I\u2019ve always wanted to hug people and hear their stories.</p> <p>My band are freelance musicians and my techs will not get paid if the shows don\u2019t happen.

I had to take it into my hands, be responsible, and reschedule them so people aren\u2019t put at risk.

It got cancelled, but everyone pulled together, with BBC Radio 2 putting a one-off show together to lift everybody\u2019s spirits \u2013 I got to sing my set live on national radio for 20 minutes.</p> <p>I felt conflicted about touring. I wanted to honour people who had paid for tickets. But there were lots of other countries that are doing things differently and that was playing on my mind. I want to do my bit, but sometimes you just don\u2019t know what the right decision is. There\u2019s people in my band that have got babies; they were playing for a lot of other artists at C2C, too, so they\u2019ve lost so much money. I feel pretty gutted about it all, if I\u2019m honest. I feel like I\u2019m living in a movie \u2013 like the world is just ceasing.</p> <p>But the most important thing is to remain positive and keep people\u2019s spirits high, and music does that for people. You only have to look at the scenes in Italy, where people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/solidarity-balcony-singing-spreads-across-italy-during-lockdown\">singing on their balconies</a>. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a lot of livestreamed concerts, and chatting to fans online, rather than putting the fear of God into people and making people feel stressed and panicked. I\u2019m trying to meditate and stay calm, laugh a lot and spread joy and be peaceful, because, like all things, this will pass.</p> <h2>\u2018The shop can only survive with government help\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Mandy Kemp is the proprietor of <a href=\"https://www.jamrecords.co.uk/\">Jam Records and Coffee</a> in Falmouth, Cornwall</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4aeef7f45a015be878edce6b8153e613aec17676\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aeef7f45a015be878edce6b8153e613aec17676/0_212_2592_1724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jam vinyl and coffee store in Falmouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jam vinyl and coffee store in Falmouth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: provided by Jam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ve been here 17 years.

There was a suggestion that it could have gone partially online, which would have been a disaster: competing with Rough Trade, Resident, record shops with really good online facilities. RSD is basically a month\u2019s worth of sales in one day, so if you\u2019re doing it it has to work.</p> <p>We could probably last a month without me having to put some money in, and I don\u2019t want to put money into a failing business. The shop can only survive with big financial help from the government. The difference between Boris and Macron\u2019s responses was worlds apart. In France, they said no business will go under and we\u2019ll put \u20ac45bn into supporting them. That\u2019s the scale of what has to happen. And it can\u2019t be loans.</p> <p>The shop has always paid me less than minimum wage \u2013 it feels like the triumph is to pay your way. It\u2019s a community of people who come here, from the customer in his 70s who has coffee every day to the tourists who come back every year.

But the artists we had were on tour in Europe, which was closing down very quick. Even if we wanted to go ahead, we wouldn\u2019t have had any artists.</p> <p>We have public funding and we\u2019re paying cancellations fees to all artists. Other promoters have complained to me about this, because they say: oh, you\u2019re setting a precedent.

I\u2019ve also got \u00a310,000-worth of flights to try and get refunds for. That\u2019s a lot of money for my size of festival. With the accommodation, I\u2019ve been offered a 50% reduction on my booking and I think I\u2019ve got to go with that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/19/best-livestreamed-gigs-coronavirus-john-legend-chris-martin-code-orange\">The best livestreamed gigs to watch at home during coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s devastating up to a point, but there\u2019s a lot of people facing a lot of hardship and I feel a bit lucky, actually. My close friends who run venues are all really struggling; a festival is a one-off thing we can cancel and move forward. The plan is to do the next year\u2019s programme with the artists we\u2019ve got now, plus extra. This year was the first time we\u2019d attempted to bring a Jamaican artist to the UK, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3FNaZ8dxuA\">I Jahbar</a>, with hard work around getting him a visa.

  "<p>On a cold winter day in the rural Netherlands, a boy goes ice skating on the local pond. His sister Jas, who had asked to come along, is resentful at being excluded. Fearing that her father might serve up her pet rabbit as a Christmas meal, she prays that God might take Matthies instead. When her brother falls through the ice, her impulsive wish comes true. Grief and trauma begin to tear the fabric of Jas\u2019s deeply religious farming family apart.</p> <p>From that day on, three forces shape Jas\u2019s world: death, sex and religion. Grief rules the house where Matthies\u2019s name must no longer even be mentioned. As the parents prove incapable of taking care of their remaining three children, the siblings\u2019 fear of and curiosity about death leads them into spirals of magical thinking that involve rituals and sacrifices of increasing violence. Raised in a strict Reformed household, Jas perceives the world through scripture, which she quotes frequently. Her father quizzes his children about the Bible and beats Jas\u2019s brother for taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Her mother\u2019s favourite day is Sunday, a day ruled by the \u201cbare essentials\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe love of God\u2019s word and Mom\u2019s vegetable soup\u201d. The rules Jas and her siblings invent for themselves join the many rules their parents and church already impose on them.</p> <p>This is the era of playing Snake on Nokia phones and The Sims on the family computer, a last generation of teenagers without frequent access to the internet. Caught in the no-man\u2019s-land between childhood and adulthood, Jas and her younger sister Hanna experiment with masturbation without recognising what it is, while the sexual games they play with their older brother Obbe become increasingly disturbing, as cruel as the animal sacrifices he asks Jas to make. The children\u2019s ignorance of their own changing desires is unsurprising in a family environment shaped by the twin forces of belonging to an orthodox church and keeping livestock: bodies are there to be useful, to mate and (re)produce. Jas\u2019s ongoing constipation is addressed by sticking soap up her bum \u2013 the same treatment that is handed out to calves. The vet, a frequent visitor, tells Jas she is almost \u201ccomplete\u201d; her father asks her how her breasts are developing, hidden under the red jacket she hasn\u2019t taken off since her brother\u2019s death. This protective layer has now become a part of her identity \u2013 \u201cjas\u201d means \u201cjacket\u201d in Dutch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6f6ffb489e658088e3b114f5cc538598ae1019f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6f6ffb489e658088e3b114f5cc538598ae1019f/19_598_3924_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Realistic bleakness \u2026 Marieke Lucas Rijneveld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Realistic bleakness \u2026 Marieke Lucas Rijneveld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marieke Lucas Rijneveld tells the story from Jas\u2019s perspective, in the first person and the present tense. This presents a riddle to the reader: the knowingness of the author sits in contrast to the narrator, who is 12 years old by the end of the book. The text is peppered with rhetorical questions (\u201cAre Mum and Dad the pests that keep eating away at us?\u201d) and similes. \u201cWe\u2019re as empty as the Queen Beatrix biscuit tin on the breakfast table we once won on the Postcode Lottery: no one can fill us up,\u201d Jas points out in a moment of characteristic self-contemplation. Everything is filtered through her eyes, a child who believes that her mother is hiding Jewish people in the basement and that killing an animal will save her family. Yet this is also a narrator who is curiously observant of other people. About her father, she remarks that he \u201cstacks his worries like the sticks of kindling: they blaze up in our feverish minds\u201d. Much here is told, not shown, the conclusions spelt out for the reader in metaphors and similes.</p> <p>Rijneveld, whose pronouns are they/them, is also a lauded poet whose debut collection <em>Kalfsvlies</em> (Calf\u2019s Caul) covers similar themes. Rijneveld shares some biographical reference points with their characters, having also grown up in a Reformed farming family and lost an older brother as a child. Now longlisted for the Booker International prize, <em>The Discomfort of Evening</em> was a bestseller and prizewinner in the Netherlands, hailed as a brilliant achievement by a major new talent. In the English translation, the choice to break up longer Dutch sentences into shorter fragments, often by inserting semicolons and colons, subtly changes the tone of the novel, tempering the urgency of Jas\u2019s breathless, slightly dreamy monologue. Translator Michele Hutchison deftly switches between registers and gives Jas a strong, unique voice.</p> <p>Ultimately, the novel will find both admirers and detractors for its poetic, mannered language, realistic bleakness and descent into surreal darkness. The book doesn\u2019t quite keep the promise of its compelling first part, where Rijneveld and Hutchison immerse us in Jas\u2019s world with detailed observations: a dried-up raisin found under a cabinet, skin formed on warm milk. As the tragedies pile up and the narration intensifies, the fascinating characters and themes sometimes lose their immediacy amid dense prose.</p> <p><em> \u2022 The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, translated by Michele Hutchison, is published by Faber (RRP \u00a312.99).

Outrage over her death led to India passing tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Far-right raids across Germany \u2013 </strong>Police have rounded up members of the United German Peoples and Tribes group, a newly banned faction of Germany\u2019s armed and dangerous Citizens of the Reich (<em>Reichsb\u00fcrger</em>)<strong> </strong>movement.

  "<p>On 13 January, a bulletin from Health Protection Scotland was sent to all GP practices in the country describing a \u201cnovel Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. I work in a small clinic in central Edinburgh with four doctors, two nurses and six admin staff. It was the first time I\u2019d heard of the virus. \u201cCurrent reports describe no evidence of significant human to human transmission, including no infections of healthcare workers,\u201d it said reassuringly.</p> <p>I cast my mind back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\" title=\"\">Sars</a> coronavirus of almost two decades ago, and briefly wondered how quickly the spread of this coronavirus would be stopped, as Sars was. A seafood market had been closed and sanitised. The bulletin said that although Wuhan was a city of 19 million people, there were only three flights per week from there to the UK, and the likely impact was \u201cvery low\u201d. I shrugged, and carried on with my work.</p> <p>Scientists had already discovered that the new virus was fundamentally different from Sars, though still within the family of coronaviruses. \u201cCorona\u201d refers to the spiky little packets of sugared protein stuck all over the surface of the spherical virus, like fleurs-de-lys sprouting from the band of a crown. Under an electron microscope they look like tiny planets, each one buzzing with angry satellites. They\u2019re a similar size to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/24/endless-hunt-for-the-perfect-influenza-vaccine-flu-jab\" title=\"\">flu viruses</a> \u2013 0.1 microns \u2013 and are widespread among many different mammals. Sars came to humans from the Asian civet; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) came via dromedary camels. It seems likely that the new virus has its origin in bats, but whether there was another mammalian intermediary between bats and humans is still uncertain.</p> <p>That evening I met up with a friend, a consultant physician who had recently come back to work after a period of time doing research. She had been stationed at a general hospital around 30 miles from Edinburgh, and was enjoying being back in the thick of clinical work, though startled at how stretched her medical colleagues were. \u201cIt\u2019s the same every year,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder when health boards will realise how many winter beds we actually need.\u201d</p> <p>A week later, Chinese infections stood at 550, and the death toll was 17. A new bulletin arrived reassuring me that the risk of infection was still low, but attaching a specific form to be completed should I suspect someone of having the virus \u2013 specifically anyone flying in from Wuhan. I was disgruntled but not alarmed when one university asked worried Chinese students to seek GP attention. \u201cBy phone!\u201d I wanted them to add, \u201ctell them to seek attention by phone!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\" title=\"\">announced</a> a global health emergency. The death toll in China reached 170, and the cases that had tested positive there reached almost 8,000. Further cases were reported in India and the Philippines.</p> <p>Coronavirus infects and irritates the lungs. Most cases are mild. In severe cases it leads to breathlessness as the lungs struggle to do their job of oxygenating the blood \u2013 something that can be relieved with oxygen delivered by mask. A proportion of those patients who require oxygen will go on to need ventilation in intensive treatment units. In these early days of the outbreak, I still thought of the virus as something that, like Mers and Sars, would be contained. As GPs we are accustomed to dealing with an annual spike in flu \u2013 the \u201cswine flu\u201d of 2009 turned out to be not much more dangerous than seasonal winter flu \u2013 though in its severity and prevalence, this new virus seemed worse.</p> <p>That same day, another message came in, this time from Lothian health board. It instructed me that masks \u201cand other personal protective equipment\u201d would be sent to the practice shortly, prompting the usual jokes among the staff that we would be sent a paper bag and some of those clingfilm gloves you get at petrol stations. Surgical masks did arrive later that week, along with a roll of tear-off plastic aprons.</p> <p>During the week, I work at my small Edinburgh practice, but at the weekend I sometimes work evening GP shifts at an \u201cout of hours\u201d (OOH) centre in the city, covering a much larger population, with a team of other doctors and nurses. I had an email from the clinical director of the centre advising me to tell any patients from mainland China that they would only need to self-isolate if they had symptoms, adding that those symptoms did <em>not</em> include a sore throat. Until then, I\u2019d been assuming that a dripping nose and a sore throat would be the herald of coronavirus infection, the way they are for most respiratory viruses. My practice started a WhatsApp group to keep one another updated. It proved as good for sharing joke videos as for the latest governmental advice.</p> <p>On 4 February, I flew to the US to give a talk at the New York Academy of Sciences about science, medicine and wonder. United Airlines warned me I would be turned back at the US border if I had been through China. There were a few face masks in use at the airport, but I still thought of this as a problem that the Chinese lockdown and the Wuhan flight ban would address.</p> <p>Radio New Zealand had also been in touch to ask if I would do an interview. The absurd levels to which we are all now interconnected came home to me as I sat down, cross-legged and jet-lagged, in a New York hotel room to talk, via Skype, to a presenter 17 hours into tomorrow. He asked me for predictions on how far this epidemic would spread. I remember saying that I had no crystal ball, but what I\u2019d seen of infection control measures in China seemed impressive \u2013 I hoped very much it would be contained as Sars had been contained, and that isolation measures would be effective. That day it was reported that 425 Chinese patients had died, and infection rates, for those who\u2019d been tested, stood at just over 20,000.</p> <p>Flying out of Newark, I found myself in a departure terminal where every table was festooned with tablet computers on stalks. They flashed like gambling machines, entertainment as well as shopping opportunities. To speak to a companion it was necessary to peer over these screens. All food and all payment was to be ordered by touching the tablets. Maybe they wipe them clean regularly, I thought, as I watched a kid pick his nose then start playing with the screen.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When I got home from New York, in early February, the threat began to feel real. That weekend the number of deaths in China <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51431087\" title=\"\">surpassed</a> those of the Sars epidemic of 2002-2003, at 811. Half-term holidays followed. Along with my wife and kids, I drove north to Orkney to see friends and take up a locum position as a GP on one of the islands for a week. At Kirkwall, on my way to the ferry, a message pinged from one of the NHS Orkney staff. Did I have time to drop by the hospital and be measured up for a \u201cface-fitting mask\u201d? These masks are effective at blocking the droplets of coughs or sneezes that carry viruses. It disturbed me that the request came in such haste \u2013 did they know something I didn\u2019t about the imminence of the outbreak? In Orkney? I had time if I dropped by the hospital right now, I replied, but had only an hour until my ferry was leaving. \u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d came the reply, and it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>By the time I got back to Edinburgh eight days later, things were changing fast. The OOH service asked if I could come by and be assessed for a face-fitting mask. But when I tried to set up an appointment, stocks had run out. New guidance appeared that, for the kind of examinations I perform as a GP, it would be enough to wear a \u201cfluid resistant\u201d mask and follow the usual infection control procedures \u2013 aprons, gloves, eye protection. The face-fitted masks were to be preserved for those performing the kind of procedures \u2013 such as intubations and endoscopies \u2013 during which you might be sprayed with saliva, or worse. Some were finding governmental advice infuriatingly inconsistent, but it was clear that tough decisions were having to be made with limited resources, and time was running out. As GPs we were being urged to avoid suspected cases in case we spread it inadvertently to others, though the virus was undoubtedly circulating among our patients at higher levels than were evident in official figures.</p> <p>On 21 February, Lombardy reported its first cases resulting from spread within Italy, rather than among people who had flown in with the virus. They still had only a handful of confirmed cases. My wife is from Lombardy, not far from Pavia, and her parents went into isolation. Italy reported its first deaths the following day, but several patients of mine were still relaxed enough about the virus to fly there for skiing.</p> <p>In the next four days, Italy\u2019s number of reported cases leapt from single figures to 229, and China\u2019s approached 80,000. But China\u2019s were slowing while Italy\u2019s appeared to be gathering momentum: on 25 February, a new bulletin from the public health specialists of NHS Lothian asked me to tell anyone who had been in Lombardy or Veneto within the last 14 days, and who had symptoms, to self-isolate. \u201cFirst of all, for reassurance,\u201d it stated, \u201cwith regards to Italy, the area of concern is only for northern Italy \u2013 north of Pisa, Florence or Rimini.\u201d I was not reassured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bfbe142eebc4a6e702621fddeaac601c2c730c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bfbe142eebc4a6e702621fddeaac601c2c730c6/0_59_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An electron microscope image from the US National Institutes of Health of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An electron microscope image from the US National Institutes of Health of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niaid Rml/NIH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I spoke that day with a patient who had returned from Milan, but who had no symptoms other than a slight sore throat, common enough for anyone just off a plane. According to the rules I\u2019d been given, he didn\u2019t have to isolate himself. \u201cHave you got a thermometer?\u201d I asked him, and toyed with the idea of dropping round to see if he had a fever, but then more calls and demands came through, and I didn\u2019t. (He subsequently recovered.)</p> <p>At the OOH centre in West Lothian, in the first week of March, it was evident just how thick the weekly traffic is between Italy and the UK. One among several calls: a man who had flown in a day earlier, from south of Pisa, and who had a cough with a fever. According to the guidance I\u2019d been given, he\u2019d been too far south to be considered as a potential case \u2013 I informed him there was no official need for self-isolation. But the advice made me uneasy, and I asked him, if he could, to stay at home and off work for at least a week.</p> <p>Another call was to a family just back from skiing; according to the location of their resort they <em>were</em> at risk, and they were referred to the public health board for testing. This is done by sending away an official form \u2013 we GPs don\u2019t get to hear who turns out positive and who doesn\u2019t.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In early March, the computer system with which GPs read all medical records, make notes on each consultation and refer patients for specialist care, had new coronavirus codes added. The idea is that anyone registered in the system with Covid-19 is tagged with a special code that will keep track of the spread of the disease, as well as our Covid-19 workload as GPs. At this point, \u201cAdvice given about 2019-nCoV\u201d was the only code that I had much opportunity to use.</p> <p>To carry on with \u201ccontainment\u201d of the virus, it felt like we would need hundreds of call-handlers to decide who should stay put and self-isolate, and who should be tested \u2013 and then hundreds more workers to trace every contact. Drive-through testing was happening now in Edinburgh, though there was only one mention of the virus today among the 30 or so patients I saw face to face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now, fear was spreading, with some justification, and the situation was beginning to feel extremely serious. One elderly lady requested a letter for her insurance company, to get her out of her package holiday; I explained that until the government changed its advice, my letter wouldn\u2019t make any difference, and she left, dejected.</p> <p>Watching the news, the measures Italy was taking seemed extraordinary, though necessary. Once, when I worked as an Antarctic expedition doctor, I studied with military medics for a diploma in the medical care of catastrophes. We learned about building makeshift hospitals, about dividing clinics into \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d zones, about planning urgent mass vaccination, about emergency medical supply chains. It felt surreal that those kinds of measures were now being discussed so close to home.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The gravity of the crisis was only just starting to be felt. It seems incredible now that I was so blase, but on Saturday 6 March, I was out with friends, jokes aplenty about nudging elbows instead of shaking hands. I stood in the corner of a pub packed with people watching the rugby. (England were victorious over Wales.) A GP friend in Fife told me that she was convinced the disease was already widespread among her own patients \u2013 she was seeing more viral breathlessness than usual, but none from people who had travelled to the \u201cat risk\u201d areas, and none who fulfilled the criteria for testing. We went together to a sold-out concert at Edinburgh\u2019s Usher Hall \u2013 capacity 2,200 \u2013 crowds singing, people hugging, everyone pretending to forget about Covid-19 for a night.</p> <p>Another friend, a hospital specialist, told me in a crowded pub that night that what we needed urgently was to slow its spread \u2013 allow the government to buy time, get in more ventilators and prepare the hospitals. But he wondered if we were doing too little too late. \u201cWe could run out of ventilators by May,\u201d he said. Evidence from China was showing that if you buy ventilators early and deploy them in new and cleared-out hospitals, you save lives.</p> <p>The following day, Italy went into lockdown, but Britons were still being allowed to fly home. The supermarkets there started offering free delivery to the over-65s. My parents-in-law at least have a garden; a neighbour is passing fresh bread over the fence. They have their chickens, their vegetable patch and a well-stocked garage. There are frightening stories from Lombardy hospitals of insufficient ventilators, and operating rooms used as intensive-care units.</p> <p>I woke up on 10 March to a WhatsApp message from a colleague \u2013 the first few Covid-19 cases from our patch of Edinburgh had been confirmed, all in people returning from Italy. They had a fever, a frontal headache and a dry cough. We were all expecting the news, but it still came like a cold slap. Everything about the way we work would have to change. Planes were still flying in from Italy and France. Websites were telling worried people to phone their GP, while each morning we GPs were picking through emails from local and national health boards for the latest advice. Protective suits were to be saved for hospital staff and paramedics at the bedsides of sick people shedding the virus.</p> <p>We decided to slash the number of appointments offered by 50%, filled the new space with phone appointments, and used a new code in the medical records: \u201cTelephone triage due to Covid-19 restrictions\u201d. All the same, a colleague and I still made five visits that day to frail, elderly, housebound patients \u2013 all of them over 85 (two over 90), and all asking anxiously about the virus, trying with their questions to gauge our own levels of concern. These are among the most lonely, isolated people in our communities. But when any GP might be asymptomatically carrying the virus, trying to assess their problems face-to-face feels like a luxury \u2013 we have to reduce home visiting to a minimum.</p> <p>There were plenty of nervous jokes among my patients that day about the coming \u201ccoronageddon\u201d, but only one who phoned in, drenched in sweat, with a dry cough and a fever of 39C. He hadn\u2019t been abroad for months, and I told him to stay home for at least a week. That evening, my GP colleagues and I had a meeting in the pub that felt like a boozy council of war. We shared stories we\u2019d heard of patients in hospital with the virus, and ideas for how to protect the practice, should we, one-by-one, end up catching it. I remembered planning meetings for the swine flu of 2009, but they were nothing like this, and the threat had felt nowhere near as real.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 11 March, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">declared</a> Covid-19 to be a pandemic. Events were moving at unprecedented speed. The UK budget was delivered and the NHS was told it would have whatever it needed. We\u2019ll see. Deaths in China continued to drop \u2013 just 19 new infections.</p> <p>A helpful message signed by all the government health departments, health boards, royal colleges and the General Medical Council also arrived on 11 March. It said that I\u2019ll be expected, in the coming weeks, to go beyond what I\u2019m accustomed to dealing with, but that I can be reassured that the GMC and health board will support me and my decisions through the crisis. \u201cClinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.\u201d It\u2019s good to feel the GMC is at my back, rather than on my back, for a change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7f25699f9a70e3271d0f06bf3828953ef920ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7f25699f9a70e3271d0f06bf3828953ef920ed8/0_190_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musselburgh primary care centre on the outskirts of Edinburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musselburgh primary care centre on the outskirts of Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among my worried patients were a grandmother with full parental responsibility for all her grandchildren. A mother of a seven-year-old daughter who has a fever and cough asked whether that means she should also be self-isolating. According to official guidance, the answer was still a disquieting \u201cno\u201d \u2013 we were still in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase \u2013 but I asked people to be pragmatic. If they felt at all unwell, stay in and minimise contact with others. The only unconcerned patient was a man with advanced cancer, spread to the liver, who thought we were all overreacting.</p> <p>By this point, we GPs were doing almost everything over the phone, even if it meant prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients, and making guesses about non-urgent diagnoses \u2013 shunting anything that wasn\u2019t an emergency into an imagined future of normality. Over morning coffee, my colleague joked about getting us beekeeper outfits, visiting only the most seriously ill in their homes while hermetically sealed in our own isolation suits. As jokes go, it wasn\u2019t very funny.</p> <p>I spent the afternoon doing a men\u2019s clinic for the city\u2019s rough sleepers and those with no fixed address, some of whom sleep in Bethany Trust dormitories. In my morning surgery, everyone had asked me about the virus; my homeless patients had, it seems, more pressing concerns. About half went to shake my hand, and thought me cowardly for bumping elbows instead.</p> <p>By the time I emerged from the clinic, Boris Johnson had told everyone with cough and cold symptoms to stay home for a week. \u201cAt last!\u201d I thought. Maybe people will take it seriously. We were again informed that more protective equipment was coming, but the droplet-resistant masks still won\u2019t be available. Everyone with a beard who works with Covid-19 patients has been asked to shave it off, as the masks don\u2019t work if there\u2019s hair between them and the skin. Anyone with religious or cultural objections was told to speak with their line manager.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Friday the 13th, and an atmosphere of dread in morning meeting at the news from Italy. There aren\u2019t enough ventilators to go round, or nurses, and people are being buried without funerals. The practice WhatsApp group has been renamed \u201cDream Team CoronaCombat\u201d in an attempt at levity. There was an air of quiet resignation at what\u2019s coming, but an edge of bunker humour, too. One of the clinic thermometers broke, and I went online to buy another \u2013 \u00a330 versions are changing hands for \u00a3125. But virologists are learning about Covid-19 all the time, and for all their horrors, the Chinese and Italian experiences mean that we\u2019re better prepared in the UK than we might have been.</p> <p>One of my patients that day, a man in his late 80s, told me that the virus is mother nature getting back at us. \u201cToo many people!\u201d he said, and chuckled. \u201cAll us oldies need clearing out!\u201d I didn\u2019t share his glee. Some who have had coughs for weeks, but that have worsened, asked me if they\u2019d got it \u2013 but there\u2019s no way of knowing, and I told them all to stay home for a further week. The lab had stopped accepting viral swabs from GPs, so unless someone is admitted to hospital, they aren\u2019t tested. And also on the 13th, the first death in Scotland, in Ediburgh, was announced.</p> <p>Spain followed Italy into lockdown, planes turning back halfway. The UK attitude of allowing schools to stay open came under attack. It was obvious we needed new ways to slow the spread, particularly among the over-65s \u2013 they\u2019re the ones most at risk from this disease. One of my colleagues has purchased us hazmat suits from eBay for home visiting, just in case. The medical students of Edinburgh University have set up a pet-and-babysitting service for NHS staff.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On Tuesday 17 March, the practice was oddly quiet \u2013 there was a hush on the streets, a sense of anxious anticipation, and my days now feel like a prelude to what is to come. People were stunned by the implications of the guidance delivered by the prime minister on Monday night \u2013 to avoid going out, to avoid restaurants and theatres, to self-isolate for 14 days if anyone in the family has symptoms. Unprecedented, necessary, belated advice. Of the 20 people I spoke to on the phone, a couple almost certainly had the virus \u2013 a new headache, fever, cough, malaise and exhaustion. I coded them \u201csuspected coronavirus infection\u201d and gave advice to stay in with their whole families, and call us if they get worsening breathlessness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\">Why we need worst-case thinking to prevent pandemics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As healthcare workers, we\u2019ve been told to follow the same advice as everyone else: stay off for 14 days if anyone in our homes has a cough or fever. Practices adjacent to my own are already losing staff, and we\u2019re clamouring for testing. If I develop a cough but test negative, I can go on working. Even better will be some future test that can show if I\u2019ve <em>had</em> the virus, and developed immunity \u2013 then I\u2019ll be able to work overtime through the coming weeks without fear. Hospital clinics are being cancelled wherever possible, all elective surgery postponed. We\u2019re clearing the decks for an onslaught. Yes, it would have been nice to have been better prepared for this pandemic, but though it\u2019s frightening, it could also be worse, and I don\u2019t feel the same anger as some of my colleagues towards the government for its prevarication over such immense and unprecedented decisions.</p> <p>On Wednesday I heard that schools are closing, and so my wife and I will be contending with the competing necessities of the kids, the virus and the NHS. My wife contacted her GP in Lombardy. The situation is, he said, very grave, and he wished us luck with what is to come. I messaged a medical contact in Beijing, the Chinese translator of my books, who said things are improving, with few new cases. \u201cAs you know, isolation is the only effective method to stop the virus,\u201d he added, and asked that I give thought to the mental health of my patients as much as to their physical needs. He ended on a sanguine note: \u201cPeople will have to change their habits for a while.

Our premiere was last Monday; between then and Friday, it was like a runaway train \u2013 one that ended with us colliding head-on with coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"053d9ebf40ed9021fdbe3e782921f12a8493f050\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/053d9ebf40ed9021fdbe3e782921f12a8493f050/258_87_3974_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philippa Lowthorpe, far left, at the Misbehaviour premiere, 9 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philippa Lowthorpe, far left, at the Misbehaviour premiere, 9 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, we made about half what was expected [\u00a3330,000, entering the UK charts at No 8]. It was just so, so sad. Everyone worked like mad, and we were all set for a lovely big hit. The kind of press we had is like gold dust. And then: agony!</p> <p>Still, I don\u2019t regret anything. We didn\u2019t consider cancelling the release because it was an unfolding situation that changed hour by hour. And I\u2019ve no qualms if the film winds up getting fast-tracked online. These are extraordinary circumstances, and there\u2019s a real role for film in cheering people up now, so I\u2019m happy for any joy we can give.</p> <p>Plus, I\u2019m grateful we managed to do the premiere - lots of the real time characters in the film who hadn\u2019t seen each other in 50 years flew in, and it was the most moving experience. On the weekend, I did one Q&amp;A in Bristol to an audience of about 30. For one tiny moment, I allowed myself to feel really gutted. But then the next day another Q&amp;A was sold out \u2013 although the cinema had capped the number of people so that everyone could sit separately.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve never felt this hopeless and bleak in my life\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Blair Barnette, film art director</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m an art director on films; my partner is a producer and was recently diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease and made redundant. After Christmas, our minimal funds began to dry up. I lined up work to take us through until August and by last Friday I was down to the last \u00a3100 in my account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e72b5401970cb44a524c409dde3ba9220919959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e72b5401970cb44a524c409dde3ba9220919959/0_116_1544_926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blair Barnette and her husband at Sainsbury\u2019s in Whitechapel, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blair Barnette and her husband at Sainsbury\u2019s in Whitechapel, east London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Blair Barnette</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over one hour, everything was cancelled. That\u2019s \u00a328,000 gone in an instant. My head started spinning. I realised the knock-on effect this would have in the industry and felt sick. It will be months before it\u2019s gaining traction again, and once it does, it will be a feeding frenzy for us freelancers.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never felt this hopeless and bleak in my life. My partner can\u2019t risk going outside because of his health. But the local supermarket won\u2019t allow me to enter during the time slot dedicated to elderly and vulnerable people unless he comes too. So I\u2019m bundling him up in a chemical face mask and Tyvek suit that I use for spray painting. I\u2019m trying to keep him safe, but I can\u2019t even seem to do that.</p> <h2>\u2018People still want to come in on Mother\u2019s Day \u2013 I think they should stay home and rewatch The Sopranos\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Kevin Markwick, owner and manager of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.picturehouseuckfield.com/homepage\">Picture House, Uckfield</a>, East Sussex</strong></p> <p>We were a pretty successful independent cinema until about a week ago. Our usual audience number on a Sunday is 1,000 \u2013 last Sunday it was 178. On Monday, 65 people came in, most of them elderly, which I thought was insane. Then on Tuesday, it was down to nine. And Boris Johnson finally advised cinemas close, rather than having the nuts to say they had to. </p> <p>Luckily, we started the year with our best-ever takings, thanks to films like Little Women, 1917, Emma and Parasite. Our speciality is upmarket mainstream; if your mum wants to see it, we\u2019re going to make a fortune. Our biggest film of all time is The King\u2019s Speech.</p> <p>We\u2019re a restaurant too, which is currently closed, but when we rang people who had booked for Mothering Sunday, most of them said they still wanted to come. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Dunkirk spirit or lemming spirit. I think they should stay home and rewatch The Sopranos.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to try to keep the business afloat, but not at the cost of safety. I reckon we\u2019ll be shut for three months at least. My parents started this cinema in 1964, when I was two years old. It\u2019s the place I grew up in and in 1994 I took it over. It feels like a lifetime\u2019s work is in danger of being lost.</p> <h2>\u2018The film sector isn\u2019t an essential service\u2019</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639780/\">Rebecca O\u2019Brien</a>, who produce</strong><strong>s </strong><strong>Ken Loach\u2019s films</strong></p> <p>Coronavirus will change the content of any story we next tell. From an existential point of view there\u2019s a lot to grapple with, and what\u2019s going on outside at the moment is possibly far more interesting than what might be going on inside a writer\u2019s head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ec063c6f174fe296b3b917b273644d6ca2c65a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ec063c6f174fe296b3b917b273644d6ca2c65a9/333_0_2685_2686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca O\u2019Brien with Ken Loach, picking up his Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for I, Daniel Blake in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca O\u2019Brien with Ken Loach in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Right now, I\u2019m mostly concerned that people do follow the guidelines. But my heart goes out to all those on zero-hours contracts, of which there are so many in the industry. It\u2019s a gig economy with people usually working on week-long contracts, at best. I hope the government comes up with some clear support for these people quickly to allay their fears. I\u2019m in the privileged position of being able to work from home easily.</p> <p>The problem is that the film sector isn\u2019t an essential service and I just can\u2019t see how we\u2019re going to be able to get going again until everything is over. What\u2019s interesting is that the BBC has kicked into becoming a backbone, with things like their exercise regimes for older people and home school resources.</p> <p>My plea to the government would be to put some proper support into the independent sector once this is over. We were in trouble before this; only 49 non-studio films were made the UK last year, because of the rise of inward investment productions and high-end TV. Yet this is where people learn their craft before they bugger off to the big boys. If our sector perishes, so will the seed bed of all those skills and the main source of home-grown talent and stories.</p> <h2>\u2018Film-makers were flying in from all over the world \u2026 would we really cancel \u201cQueer Christmas\u201d?\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Tricia Tuttle, BFI </strong><strong>festivals </strong><strong>director</strong></p> <p>The London Book Fair, SXSW, Tribeca film festival \u2026 over the last few weeks, one by one, we watched them cancel, with a dawning sense of inevitability.

Many attendees call the festival \u201cqueer Christmas\u201d. Film-makers were flying in from all over the world. Festivals are one of the principal ways LGBTIQ+ film-makers connect with a queer audience. Our team - events, industry, hospitality and guest coordinators and the programmers who spend half of the year putting together the 200+ screenings and events \u2013 were going to be gutted.Plus, it would be a devastating financial blow for the BFI, a charity. </p> <p>But as the hours passed, continuing became untenable. We made the tough decision over countless war room calls last weekend, just ahead of the new official advice that prompted the closure of BFI Southbank for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Still, we will not go quietly. We\u2019re going to recreate a little virtual Flare on BFI Player, with every original booker getting a free month\u2019s subscription. It\u2019s not a queer Christmas, but hopefully it\u2019s a small concession present.</p> <h2><em>\u2018</em>Coronavirus is killing off the subjects of my film\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Tammy \u2018TS\u2019 Botkin, director of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10764868/\">Legacy of the Fighting Filipinos</a></strong></p> <p>For the past 18 months I\u2019ve been working on a documentary about second world war veterans from the Philippines, racing against the clock to wrap before they all die without appropriate recognition.</p> <p>Now, Covid-19 has taken aim at my subjects: elderly Filipino men and women who served in the US army but were denied benefits and citizenship by the US Congress in 1946. Some of the subjects of the film who are in lockdown have stopped responding.</p> <p>Coronavirus has also shut down the final two scheduled shoots for the film, and donors have withdrawn support as they watch their portfolios take massive hits. I\u2019m unable to pay myself or my producer, Amanda Upson, which threatens to put us both out of our homes.</p> <p>Freelance film-makers cannot access the stop-gap provided by unemployment benefits or the emergency funds provided by unions. We are many, and we are out of luck. Still, perhaps not so out of luck as the veterans in my film. I\u2019m worried for my livelihood; they for their lives.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>This will be a devastating blow for a sector already under stress\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Kevin Macdonald, Oscar-winning director</strong></p> <p>So far, I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. I\u2019m working on an edit for my new film [a drama set in Guant\u00e1namo with Jodie Foster, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tahar Rahim] in a suite five minutes walk from my house. We finished shooting two weeks ago when we flew back from Mauritania. Lots of people were reluctant to travel there because few people have shot a film in the country before; it\u2019s all desert with a tiny Bedouin population. But it all went really smoothly \u2013 no illnesses, no problems. Then we flew home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25f04dd56f5d7f4f6cd2f5af0adf2b53c8212e68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25f04dd56f5d7f4f6cd2f5af0adf2b53c8212e68/0_0_4332_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Kevin MacDonald\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Kevin MacDonald.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Deadline/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our problems will come when it comes to the film getting seen. It\u2019s the kind of movie that relies on exposure at the fall festivals like Toronto or Telluride; we\u2019d also hoped to release a trailer at Cannes. But perhaps none of those will happen this year.</p> <p>Who knows if cinemas will even be open in the autumn? Will coronavirus be the final nail in the coffin for the mass cinematic experience, or will people be desperate for it once this is over? Does the old model still work or will Netflix and the other streamers manage total domination over the next few months?</p> <p>It was striking that Universal announced they were moving to stream new releases, having fought for years to keep that theatrical window open. I suppose they felt they had to in order to survive. My fear is this will be a devastating blow for a sector already under a lot of stress. Still, thank goodness for streaming, otherwise the film industry wouldn\u2019t have any sort of fallback.</p> <p>I once made a film set in a sort of post-apocalyptic scenario [How I Live Now (2013)] and it seems people are now more drawn to watching movies that fictionalise this sort of situation. Perhaps they want to see their worst fears realised on screen \u2013 then they become less frightening.</p> <p>During the second world war, film-makers thought audiences would want escapism. In fact the most popular films of the period were war movies, which realistically reflected the drama happening every day.</p> <h2> \u2018Our income dipped 90% day-on-day\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Kelly Jeffs, CEO of the <a href=\"https://light-house.co.uk/LightHouseMediaCentre.dll/Home\">Light House cinema</a>, Wolverhampton</strong></p> <p>I run the only independent cinema in the black country, which also acts as a community hub.

The past few weeks have been a nightmare, from the stress of a two-hour commute on public transport to dealing with talent demanding I find them hand sanitiser <em>now</em>.</p> <p>I also got a cold, which didn\u2019t shift. I knew people were gossiping about me, and a lot of people ridiculed me for being at work (this was before government guidelines suggested self-isolation). I had to take breathers outside as my hands were shaking from the stress and pressure.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 10pm on Sunday that we were told we weren\u2019t now required and that we had had our last pay cheque. I am now left without a job, with bills and rent to pay.

Rather than having a full-time contract, I\u2019m employed as a \u201cdaily\u201d, which is common for many of us in the costume department. All my work has been cancelled.</p> <p>Since Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference on Monday, I am now considered \u201ca high-risk group\u201d. So do I earn while I still can or follow government guidelines and self-isolate for three months? I have 14 weeks left until my due date.</p> <p>As I am self-employed I have to have worked 26 weeks to qualify for statutory maternity pay; I am currently two weeks short for this. This is my first baby and the usual fears are compounded by having no income and no prospect of the benefits I\u2019d anticipated.</p> <h2>\u2018Every month that passes costs my small business \u00a370,000\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Ben Rothwell, </strong><strong>managing </strong><strong>director, <a href=\"http://www.bapty.co.uk/\">Bapty</a></strong></p> <p>The government must take into consideration the billions contributed to the economy by the UK film industry when addressing the fallout from coronavirus. We have gone from feast to famine overnight. I run a small production business with 10 full-time employees working on features and TV shows all now either on hiatus or cancelled. I have no income stream at all, my business rates are huge, and every month that goes by is going to cost me about \u00a370,000.</p> <p>I have kept all my staff on full wages as statutory sick pay will not allow them to pay the bills. I can only sustain this for so long before the business goes under. Without help our industry will not survive to be able to pick up where we left off.</p> <h2>\u2018I have no work and I\u2019m owed payment on 12 jobs\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Michael Reynolds, treatment writer</strong></p> <p>I live in LA and I\u2019m a treatment writer for films, TV shows and commercials. Since last Friday, I\u2019ve seen an almost immediate shutdown of jobs. Directors at the top of the food chain who work regularly will be OK. But that\u2019s not the case for many.</p> <p>For me, this sudden shutdown brings up issues both around future earnings and money already earned but not yet paid. Not to mention larger issues around worker rights and, frankly, my role, even if small, in feeding a rapacious capitalist system that also keeps me in business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At present, I\u2019m owed payment on 12 jobs. And there is nothing legally I can do to induce companies to pay me.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are never contracts. So no legal protections and little recourse for non-payment. By and large, companies honour their commitments, but every now and again, one won\u2019t, and you have to accept that as part of the cost of doing business.</p> <p>At present, I\u2019m owed payment on 12 jobs. And there is nothing legally I can do to induce companies to pay me. If they have closed their offices and no one is at accounting, they aren\u2019t writing cheques. If they\u2019ve just seen future earnings dry up, I don\u2019t imagine many of them will be keen to send me (and others) money, even though it is for work I\u2019ve already done. It highlights the fragility of a freelance system that has no real regulation and no worker protection.</p> <h2>\u2018I was working on a documentary about the virus when I had to go into quarantine\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jesus Garces Lambert, director</strong></p> <p>I am a Mexican who has lived for the past 24 years in Rome. A couple of weeks ago, I was aware of the problem, but didn\u2019t believe we were about to become the epicentre of the pandemic.</p> <p>A US production house commissioned me to make a documentary about the virus, and I was working on this when I was told someone I had been in contact with was infected.

The worst thing is we still don\u2019t know when the wider crisis will end; I can see now military trucks transporting hundreds of bodies from the hospitals to be incinerated.</p> <p>These are terrible times, but I am trying to respond positively. Speaking to friends in Mexico, I realised the low levels of consciousness about coronavirus over there, and the minimal government efforts. So I made a collective video-diary of expats explaining the impact.</p> <h2>\u2018Watch Netflix while you self-isolate \u2013 but spare a thought for the people who made those shows\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jo Rae, owner of Kraken Films</strong></p> <p>I run a London film fixer company that organises film locations, production, crew and kit hire for overseas clients. Now all productions are on hold or cancelled. But as an industry we cannot work from home. That advice is near useless. Our offices are film studios, outdoor locations, meetings at agencies and clients\u2019 offices. Ninety per cent of my team at any point will be freelance.</p> <p>The public are told to take comfort in watching Netflix while self-isolating, but everyone who created this content has now had their livelihood put on hold. Most won\u2019t get sick pay or universal credit. Many are struggling to try to pay rent, let alone fighting over bog roll.</p> <p>It\u2019s like we are living in a bad zombie pandemic movie.

Her records show why, 70 years later, her son is now one of a fast-growing band of increasingly successful \u2013 and award-winning \u2013 Swedish winemakers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really quite clear,\u201d said Hansson, 68, a former financier who planted his first vines on the south-facing slopes of what is now the H\u00e4ll\u00e5kra vineyard in 2003, and today has about 22,000 on 6.5 hectares.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an extra month of summer now. And winters are not like what they used to be. That\u2019s why we can make wine, and why 50 years ago, we couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>September, Hansson said, used to be the month when temperatures would plummet, but not any more: \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing daytime temperatures of 24 or 25C, even at the end of the month, with perfect, cool nights. Impossible when I was a kid, and not very different from Burgundy.\u201d</p> <p>Even a decade ago, few would have bet on Scandinavia becoming a serious producer of quality wine. But while temperatures of up to 48C <a href=\"https://www.drinks-today.com/wine/news/europes-heatwave-cooks-french-vines\">grilled grapes on the vine</a> in some traditional wine-making areas of southern Europe last summer \u2013 costing some French growers up to 80% of their crop \u2013 global heating is incubating a whole new industry in the Nordic region.</p> <p>Denmark now has about 90 commercial vineyards, compared with two in 2005, while Sweden has 50. A handful of bold pioneers are growing grapes in Finland, and the world\u2019s most northerly functioning vineyard overlooks Norway\u2019s largest fjord.</p> <p>They are, of course, infinitesimally small beer compared with the more established winemakers of southern and central Europe: according to Sveneric Svensson of the Swedish Wine Association, Sweden has barely 125 hectares of land under vine, against an estimated EU total \u2013 mostly in France, Italy and Spain \u2013 of 3.3m.</p> <p>Output is tiny: Sweden produced less than 450,000 litres of wine in 2019; France alone made more than 4.5bn. \u201cWe are still very much in our infancy,\u201d Svensson said. \u201cBut commercial production is now serious.

Created in 1975 in Freiburg in southern Germany, the variety is \u201cparticularly suited to Scandinavian conditions\u201d, Sofrakis said. \u201cIt just really seems to like it here. It\u2019s our insurance policy: even in a bad year, it will make a good wine.\u201d</p> <p>The most common variety for reds is rondo, created in 1964 in the former Czechoslovakia by cross-breeding St Laurent, a classic grape more usually seen in the European Alps \u2013 although several growers, including Hansson, have now also begun successfully producing pinot noir.</p> <p>\u201cUp here, it\u2019s a constant and necessary process of trial and error,\u201d Hansson said. \u201cEach year, we try something new in a small part of the vineyard. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. We now know, for example, that merlot isn\u2019t possible here. Very nice leaves, totally lousy grapes.\u201d</p> <p>One advantage that Scandinavia\u2019s neophyte winemakers have over southern European producers is that their more recently developed grape varieties, grown in a cooler climate make for markedly more disease-resistant vines.</p> <p>\u201cThe wine industry, as a whole, uses a lot of chemicals,\u201d said Sofrakis. \u201cIt\u2019s common practice in France, for example, to spray your vines between 14 and 18 times. Here, I haven\u2019t sprayed once in 18 years.\u201d</p> <p>Hansson, along with several Swedish winemakers, now sells to top restaurants in Sweden as well as exporting to <em>sommeliers</em> and specialist wine merchants in cities such as Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. But it has not always been easy. In the early days, he said, finding a customer was as hard as producing a good wine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Growing is one thing, but producing something decent is very much another</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWine drinkers here were used to a big, classic, southern European flavour profile, which we obviously didn\u2019t match,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But 15 years on, said Mick Daly, an Australian former engineer who now works with Hansson, the fact that the wine \u201cis local, the product of a <em>terroir</em>, of our specific climate and conditions in Sk\u00e5ne \u2026 it used to be a negative; it\u2019s now a positive. We\u2019re no longer just a novelty. People who used to take a glass now take a bottle.\u201d</p> <p>Cracking the Swedish retail market was doubly hard because low production volumes mean prices are necessarily high \u2013 typically \u20ac25-30 (\u00a323-28) a bottle \u2013 and, unlike in Denmark, only the state-run monopoly, Systembolaget, is allowed to sell alcohol in Sweden. Winemakers cannot sell their product on-site or by mail order.</p> <p>But as the quality of Swedish wines has improved, more official stores have begun selling them. \u201cThe quality is really getting there,\u201d said Joel, an assistant manager at Systembolaget\u2019s central Malm\u00f6 outlet, which now offers a dozen different Swedish white, sparkling, red and dessert wines. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a buzz.\u201d</p> <p>At Bloom in the Park, his Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking the lake in the city\u2019s Pildammarna park, Igi Vidal said he was \u201cproud to introduce diners to Swedish wines as objectively fine as these\u201d.

Round, creamy, golden \u2026 Comparable with some of the world\u2019s best.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists say the world\u2019s wine map could be fundamentally changed by global heating, with traditional winemaking regions in southern Europe, as well as Australia, California and Latin America, becoming simply too hot while more northerly areas such as the UK, the Netherlands and Scandinavia boom.</p> <p>That does not mean northern vineyards will find life easy. Rising temperatures may have improved growing conditions, but global heating also means more extreme and unpredictable weather: heavy rain, violent storms and hail. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an advantage,\u201d said Hansson. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, too. We will need to be very good growers.\u201d</p> <p>The challenges in southern Europe, however, look daunting. In Spain and Italy, winemakers are moving to higher altitudes and planting on north-facing slopes to prevent record temperatures ripening grapes too fast, boosting their sugar and alcohol content to unacceptable levels and irreversibly altering their flavour.</p> <p>In France, scientists at the Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin in Bordeaux are exploring how more heat- and drought-resistant grape varieties from countries such as Georgia, Portugal and Tunisia fare in south-west France against traditional Bordeaux varieties such as merlot, which is thought to be unlikely to survive the coming decades.</p> <p>Faced with global heating, producers in the chateaux of the Bordeaux region are hampered by strict rules governing how their wine must be made if it is to qualify for the Bordeaux appellation: irrigation is not allowed and a true Bordeaux wine can be made from just six authorised grape varieties.</p> <p>As irrigation is not seen as a sustainable option, <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/bordeaux-new-wine-grapes-419730/\">producers voted unanimously last July</a> to experiment with allowing up to 10% of seven new grape types \u2013 including two from Portugal \u2013 in the final blend of certain Bordeaux categories in a historic effort to combat the effects of climate change while retaining the wine\u2019s key characteristics.</p> <p>Nordic growers, meanwhile, see mostly upside to the changes ahead. \u201cSerious money\u201d was now being invested in Swedish vineyards, Sofrakis said, the largest of which now have up to 20 hectares under vine. What was once a retirement hobby has become a career option: ambitious young Swedes are studying winemaking in France and California before returning to work in the industry at home.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a critical mass now, a momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the conditions to produce quality wines; there aren\u2019t many places in the world like this.

  "<p>Governments across Africa are rushing to reinforce measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, fearing that fragile health systems will be swiftly overwhelmed if the disease spreads beyond a small number of cases on the continent.</p> \n<p>World Health Organization (WHO) officials have called for a strong response to a \u201ctremendously fast rise in the number of countries with cases being confirmed\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to ratchet up what is being done,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is what is done at this point that will determine the numbers who will become very ill \u2026 I still think it is possible that we will prevent large numbers of people dying but it needs coordination, a huge effort and huge resources.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most infections involve people who have recently been in Europe or other disease hot spots, but the number of cases of internal transmission are rising every day.</p> \n<p>Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, has warned that official numbers may underestimate the extent of the spread of the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cProbably we have undetected cases or unreported cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point, so the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Health officials across Africa know that hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads through overcrowded cities, remote villages and among vulnerable populations such as refugees, the malnourished or those suffering from HIV and other chronic conditions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO is working to establish the exact numbers of ICU beds available across the continent. \u201cWe know [the number] is extremely limited \u2026 It is a huge challenge,\u201d said Moetse. \u201cIt is necessary not to give up on containment .\u201d</p> \n<p>South Africa, which has one of Africa\u2019s best public health systems, has fewer than 1,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 160 are in the private sector, for a population of 56m. In Malawi, there are about 25 ICU beds in public hospitals, serving 17 million people. The main infectious diseases hospital in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare, has none, Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said.</p> \n<p>Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous state, is scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur health system is not as strong as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control. \u201cIt is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak that we are focused so intensively on prevention and early detection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many states have suspended flights and other transport links with badly hit zones in Europe and Asia, or are strictly controlling entry. Restrictions have also been placed on public gatherings, schools and religious services, and mass events have been cancelled across the continent.</p> \n<p>Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda\u2019s minister of health, said the country was on \u201chigh alert\u201d as almost all its neighbours have registered cases of Covid-19. \u201cNo country can say they are 100% prepared,\u201d Aceng told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Uganda\u2019s new coronavirus tsar, Atel Kagirita, said the virus \u201cwill not be a big problem ... if we can effectively stop local transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe \u2026 don\u2019t envisage having many cases [needing critical care] because we are putting all our efforts on prevention. We are doing a lot of community awareness campaigns and public education,\u201d Kagirita said.</p> \n<p>Though Aceng said she was confident Uganda has \u201cenough capacity beds, some ICU units and ventilation to handle a possible outbreak\u201d, some fear this is too optimistic. Uganda \u2013 population 44m \u2013 is relying primarily on the 1,500-bed Mulago National Referral Hospital. Its ICU can currently accommodate 60 patients.</p> \n<p>There are also limited facilities for isolation. In South Sudan, devastated by a five-year civil war, the government has just 24 isolation beds, said Dr. Angok Gordon Kuol, incident manager for the outbreak at the ministry of health.</p> \n<p>In Somalia, health minister Dr Fawziya Abikar said the government has established a quarantine facility at Mogadishu airport and was equipping a hospital to deal with Covid-19 cases. \u201cWe are still waiting for more equipment for the hospital to arrive,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Dr Ali Yusuf, one of a team of health officials preventing and controlling the Coronavirus, told the Guardian that facilities were extremely limited. \u201cWe only have 15 tents, with one bed each for quarantine and isolation of suspected cases. Our hospital can accommodate only 100 beds,\u201d Dr Yusuf said.</p> \n<p>Many African countries have extensive experience in controlling highly infectious and potentially lethal diseases. Preparations for an outbreak of Ebola, which killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, mean that Uganda has already stockpiled protective equipment, drugs and tents, as well as developing a capacity of moving samples around the country to a central laboratory or using mobile testing laboratories.</p> \n<p>Also, the delayed arrival of the virus has allowed governments to work with the WHO to strengthen emergency coordination, improve surveillance, and begin equipping treatment centres.</p> \n<p>But few doubt that if the virus starts to take hold the consequences could be very serious, with health systems rapidly overwhelmed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Pauline Byakika, a specialist in infectious diseases at Uganda\u2019s Makerere University College of Health Sciences, said she was worried that \u201conce its gets here, [coronavirus] was going to spread very fast\u201d.

Before you know it the whole household is going to be sick,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>There are similar fears in South Africa, where president Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a state of national disaster and imposed stringent restrictions. As elsewhere in the continent, the youthfulness of South Africa\u2019s population may help \u2013 <a href=\"https://issafrica.org/research/southern-africa-report/south-africa-first-getting-to-thuma-mina\">only 6% of South Africans are older than 65</a>, which is the higher-risk age group for coronavirus.

Under the scheme, one country would buy the goods and store them, receiving 90% of the cost from EU funds. The EU\u2019s emergency response coordination centre, which also deals with floods, forest fires and earthquakes, would be responsible for distributing supplies based on need.</p> \n  <p>But it remains unclear how quickly stockpiles can be built, as governments around the world ramp up demand for medical equipment.</p> \n  <p>In recent days and weeks, the commission has launched several joint procurement schemes to buy protective medical clothing, eye goggles and masks. The latest, for ventilators, was launched earlier this week. </p> \n  <p>EU member states and the UK can choose to opt into the procurement schemes, a means to use bulk purchasing power to secure a good deal.

The new hospital will have beds for 500 patients and will be ready in the next month, officials have said. </p> \n  <p>While the government has claimed that its success has stemmed from early border closures with China and quick isolation of suspected cases, there are also concerns that Russia may be underestimating the official numbers of those infected with coronavirus in order to avert public panic. </p> \n  <p>Last week, the Russian business daily RBC reported that registered pneumonia cases in Moscow had grown 37% between January 2019 and January 2020, speculating that a wave of new coronavirus infections could have been registered as cases of pneumonia or other pulmonary diseases. </p> \n  <p>The Kremlin has said that it is protecting Vladimir Putin, 67, from contracting the disease by testing members of his entourage.

Hopefully, it will continue in the future.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Russia has closed its borders to most foreigners and has cancelled many flights to Europe and the US.

When the last one started in 2008 it took the Bank of England six months to spot it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/britain-faces-economic-emergency-warns-new-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-covid-19\">This time it is different</a>. Then it was a financial virus, this time it is the real thing. Commentators often say the economy is hitting the wall or is falling off a cliff on the weakest of evidence.

That is not a recession, it is a collapse surpassing anything in modern times, including the Great Depression.</p> \n  <p>When the banks were bailed out in 2008, it was because policymakers feared precisely what is now happening: a complete shutdown of the global economy. The rescue package worked, but only just. The early indications from China are that the impact of Covid-19 is markedly greater than that of the financial crisis, itself the most severe downturn of the postwar era.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\">Peacetime constraints ditched in the war for economic survival | Larry Elliott</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73138a8f085e564ad86e93\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T06:47:50.961Z\">6.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dozens of London underground stations are to be closed indefinitely</strong>.

And now, more than ever, we need each other. We need each other for truth, for support, and to feel less alone during a time that can honestly feel quite scary. There are so many around the world who need support right now, who are working tirelessly to respond to this crisis behind the scenes, on the frontline, or at home. Our willingness, as a people, to step up in the face of what we are all experiencing with COVID-19 is awe-inspiring. This moment is as true a testament there is to the human spirit. We often speak of compassion. All of our lives are in some way affected by this, uniting each of us globally. How we approach each other and our communities with empathy and kindness is indisputably important right now. Over the coming weeks, this will be our guiding principle. We will be sharing information and resources to help all of us navigate the uncertainty: from posting accurate information and facts from trusted experts, to learning about measures we can take to keep ourselves and our families healthy, to working with organisations that can support our mental and emotional well-being. In addition, we will focus on the inspiring stories of how so many of you around the world are connecting in ways big and small to lift all of us up. We are all in this together, and as a global community we can support each other through this process \u2013 and build a digital neighbourhood that feels safe for every one of us. We look forward to sharing more over the days and weeks to come...</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> The Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> (@sussexroyal) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-03-18T15:17:29+00:00&quot;>Mar 18, 2020 at 8:17am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72d7d48f085c6327bc2b31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T02:27:16.468Z\">2.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Between <strong>400 and 500 foreigners are stranded in Panama</strong> after a \u201ctribal\u201d festival and music event ended with many of them being quarantined at the concert site near the Caribbean beach of Playa Chiquita, an organiser said Wednesday. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>At the same time, Panama\u2019s government announced that the <strong>number of coronavirus cases in the country had risen to 109</strong> and that a nighttime curfew would be imposed beginning Wednesday night. <br><br>James Baker of Manchester, England, said those attending the Tribal Gathering included people from Spain, Canada, the United States, Denmark, France, Britain and Hungary as well as Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. <br><br>Baker said authorities in Panama had instituted a requirement that <strong>all those seeking to leave had to prove they had been in Panama for at least 14 days</strong>.

The US has less than 950,000 hospital beds which is the equivalent of 2.8 per 1,000 people - a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">lower rate than China, South Korea and Italy.</a> </p> \n  <p>Almost 20% of the US population - or 49million people - are aged over 65. But as this varies hugely by county, it\u2019s important to know where they are, and where the beds are.</p> \n  <p>New research by <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/equity/hospital-access-seniors/\">Headwaters Economics </a>and <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-crowded-cities-and-lonely-country-see-your-countys-hospital-bed-capacity?utm_source=wcn1&amp;utm_medium=email\">High Country News </a>has found that 1.8 million people 65 years and older - or 4% of all US seniors - live in a county without a hospital. In addition, 86% of counties with no hospital beds have a higher than national average senior population; most of those counties are rural.</p> \n  <p>This snapshot, which uses data from the Department of Homeland Security and Commerce Department, is important as 10 to 20% of those who get infected with Covid-19 could require hospitalization, according to what we\u2019ve seen in Asia and Europe. The vast majority of these are elderly people and/or those with preexisting medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes or respiratory problems.</p> \n  <p>The research identifies stark deficiencies in some regions: over 570,000 people in 11 Western states live in counties without hospitals. The majority are in Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico and Oregon. Whereas in California\u2019s Riverside County, home to the popular retirement community of Palm Springs, there are 10 beds for every 1000 seniors - well above the national average.</p> \n  <p>But, surprisingly perhaps, while many rural communities have no nearby hospital, rural areas in the West actually have more hospital beds on average per person than urban areas.</p> \n  <p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-crowded-cities-and-lonely-country-see-your-countys-hospital-bed-capacity?utm_source=wcn1&amp;utm_medium=email\">here.</a><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73c2678f088d7575596bc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T19:09:53.359Z\">7.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Senator Lindsey Graham is trying to convince Trump to oppose direct payments in response to the coronavirus crisis, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1240709683792318464\">according to a Politico reporter</a>.</p> \n  <p>However, the <strong>Trump administration </strong>has expressed openness to the idea, which would be included in the third coronavirus response bill.</p> \n  <p>Treasury secretary <strong>Steven Mnuchin </strong>said this morning that he expected American families to start receiving payments within three weeks of the stimulus bill being passed by Congress.</p> \n  <p>Mnuchin said the administration was looking at providing $1,000 to American adults and $500 to children, so a family of four would receive $3,000. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73befb8f088d7575596b8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-glenza\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T18:52:39.143Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A researcher who spurred the United States and United Kingdom to action with dire coronavirus modeling has been diagnosed with Covid-19 himself.</p> \n  <p>Professor Neil Ferguson heads modeling at Imperial College London\u2019s MRC centre for global infectious disease analysis.

The number of positive cases increased by 643, or 25%, to 3,269, as local authorities were promised funding for social care and the NHS appealed to retired doctors and nurses to return.</p> <h2>Health secretary could not live on UK sick pay</h2> <p>Matt Hancock admitted he could not survive on statutory sick pay, \u00a394.25 per week, but went on to raise the prospect of further help for some of the most disadvantaged as the economic consequences of the coronavirus took effect. There are fears that some workers may not self-isolate if they experience symptoms because they are worried about losing income.</p> <h2>Trump incorrectly claims drug ready \u2018almost immediately\u2019</h2> <p>The US president sowed fresh confusion about his government\u2019s response to the pandemic by claiming that chloroquine, a therapeutic drug that has not been approved for use against coronavirus, would be available \u201calmost immediately\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-drug-trump-confusion-malaria-treatment-readiness\">only to be swiftly contradicted by officials</a>.

Thirteen elderly people at the same nursing centre died earlier this month.</p> <h2>Netflix to reduce streaming quality to ease internet pressure</h2> <p>Movies, TV episodes and other videos for Netflix users across Europe will temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/19/netflix-to-slow-europe-transmissions-to-avoid-broadband-overload\">have their quality reduced</a> to ease pressure on internet service providers. It is expected that the connection speed will be reduced by 25%.</p> <h2>Brazil to close large majority of border</h2> <p>Latin America\u2019s largest country is to close its borders with most of its South American neighbours \u2013 a decision others had already made and is therefore mainly symbolically significant \u2013 and is treating any patient with symptoms of \u201csevere flu\u201d as a coronavirus case.</p> <h2>UN world food programme director tests positive</h2> <p>David Beasley said he had tested positive for coronavirus after a trip to Canada. The former governor of South Carolina said his symptoms were mild and he was in good spirits. He is working from home and his employees are helping him inform anyone he had contact with during his trip.</p> <h2>Do not forget those fleeing war and persecution, warns UN chief</h2> <p>Filippo Grandi, the United Nations refugee chief, urged states not to block the passage of asylum seekers as countries close their borders to control the pandemic. \u201cThey need \u2013 we all need - solidarity and compassion now more than ever before,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Cannes film festival postponed</h2> <p>This year\u2019s edition of the film showcase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/19/cannes-film-festival-postpones-2020-edition-over-coronavirus-restrictions\">is to be delayed</a> after the French government banned public gatherings of more than 100 people on Friday, then joined the EU-wide lockdown preventing non-EU nationals from entering the Schengen zone.</p> <h2>Plans to encourage Chinese cinemagoers to the movies</h2> <p>Business at Chinese cinemas, when most of its 70,000 screens reopen at the end of March,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/19/chinese-cinemas-detail-plans-to-lure-back-audiences-after-coronavirus\"> is to be kickstarted</a> by Chinese blockbusters American Dreams in China and 2015\u2019s Wolf Totem, along with two patriotic crowdpleasers chosen by the country\u2019s main state-owned distributor.</p>"
