  "<p>China has been accused of using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to take some bold and provocative actions, including expansions in the South China Sea, crackdowns on activists in Hong Kong and further detention of activists in the mainland. Some analysts have suggested Beijing is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security/china-rattles-sabres-as-world-battles-coronavirus-pandemic-idUSKBN2230GC\">sending a message that China\u2019s aggressive foreign policy is still business as usual</a>, or <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/same-as-it-ever-was-chinas-pandemic-opportunism-on-its-periphery/\">testing its adversaries for weaknesses</a>.</p> <h2>Rounding up activists</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong+protest\">frequent protests</a> that have rocked Hong Kong for months were already in a lull when the outbreak started, but amid fears of an epidemic in Hong Kong they have almost completely stopped. The Chinese government and its supportive Hong Kong counterparts are taking advantage of the break to try ensure they don\u2019t start up again.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people have been arrested on charges relating to the protest rallies, some of which drew millions to the street, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">arrests of senior figures in February</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">again on Saturday</a> have drawn sharp rebuke. </p> <p>Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic party, has said there will be more fatalities and protests if authorities try to pass anti-subversion laws \u2013 which would outlaw \u201csedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets\u201d \u2013 before the September legislature election. \u201cThe Communist party won\u2019t show any mercy\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">he told the Guardian</a>. \u201cThey have already stated their stance.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/hong-kong-using-covid-19-crisis-as-golden-opportunity-for-crackdown-says-arrested-leader\">Veteran activist and politician Lee Cheuk Yan,</a> who was arrested in both roundups, said: \u201cThey are using this opportunity of the pandemic so we can\u2019t come out in the marches.\u201d</p> <p>The arrests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/us-and-uk-condemn-arrest-of-hong-kong-democracy-activists\">drew condemnation from around the world</a>, and China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said the arrests of the 15 activists were \u201canother nail in the coffin of \u2018one country two systems\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Authorities maintained the action was about the rule of law, creating a deterrence, and securing the city before the protests started up again.</p> <h2>\u201cNon-release releases\u201d</h2> <p>After four-and-a-half years in prison for \u201csubversion\u201d, human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/china-quarantines-human-rights-lawyer-wang-quanzhang-400km-from-home\">Wang Quanzhang was released from a Chinese prison two weeks ago</a>. But he was immediately sent to compulsory quarantine in his home town of Jinan, not in Beijing where he lives with his wife and son.</p> <p>The US state department and human rights groups have called for Wang, jailed after the 2015 roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates, to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/us-urges-china-to-let-human-rights-lawyer-return-home-after-unjust-detention\">released from \u201cunjust detention\u201d</a> and allowed to return home.</p> <p>Poet and activist Li Bifeng was <a href=\"https://www.nchrd.org/2011/01/prisoner-of-conscience-li-bifeng/\">released on 7 April</a> after serving a 10-year sentence but forced into \u201cquarantine\u201d in a guesthouse in Sichuan province. Authorities refused to disclose his location to his family.</p> <p>The practice of \u201cnon-release releases\u201d of dissidents has been criticised by rights groups.</p> <h2>Further detentions</h2> <p>Police detained film maker and poet Chen Jiaping in early March, according to his wife. Chen had been making a documentary about legal scholar and activist Xu Zhiyong, who went missing in February and is believed to be held by police under a secretive detention system known as residential surveillance at a designated location.</p> <p>Zhao Huaiguo, the pastor of an underground house church in Hunan was detained on 14 March on charges of \u201cinciting subversion\u201d. Consumer rights activist Wang Qing, known for using China\u2019s open government information system to hold officials accountable, was charged alongside three other men for extortion and blackmail last year. In April, he was denied an appeal on his case.</p> <p>Three citizen journalists disappeared in Wuhan after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/li-zehuajournalist-wouldnt-stay-quiet-covid-19-coronavirus\">reporting on the outbreak</a>, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/missing-wuhan-citizen-journalist-reappears-after-two-months\">Li resurfaced in the past week</a> with a video detailing his detention by police and forced quarantine.</p> <p>Numerous activists and lawyers remain in jail, despite international calls for their release. Veteran activist and founder of a human rights website, 64 Tianwang, Huang Qi was detained in November 2016, on suspicion of \u201cillegally leaking state secrets abroad.\u201d Last year he was jailed on a 12-year sentence.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said authorities have refused requests from his lawyers for documents, and disbarred two of them. Sichuan police have also harassed his mother, a woman in her eighties, including placing her under house arrest and sending government agents to live in her home, HRW said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile everyone\u2019s attention is on Covid-19, we should not let the Chinese government off the hook for their ongoing crackdown on human rights activists, lawyers and independent journalists,\u201d said Human Rights Watch China researcher, Yaqiu Wang.</p> <h2>One country, one system</h2> <p>While Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy semi-autonomy until 2047 before it is returned to Chinese rule, the past week has seen some suggest China is trying to bring that deadline forward.</p> <p>Last week Beijing\u2019s top organisations in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) and the liaison office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">weighed into domestic political arguments</a>, criticising pro-democracy legislators over filibustering tactics and creating a backlog of legislation.</p> <p>The office was accused of overreach and intruding into Hong Kong affairs in contravention of Hong Kong\u2019s mini constitution, the Basic Law, which guarantees non-interference.</p> <p>Beijing authorities claimed the protections in the Basic Law article didn\u2019t apply to them, and that the Central government exercised \u201cfull governance\u201d over Hong Kong.</p> <p>It came as the head of China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/china-official-hong-kong-luo-huining-pushes-national-security-law\">called for long-shelved national security legislation to be introduced</a> as soon as possible to safeguard against threats to national security, like the protests.</p> <h2>South China Sea</h2> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has accused China of exploiting the world\u2019s focus on the virus with \u201cprovocative behaviour\u201d, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/australia-joins-u-s-ships-in-south-china-sea-amid-rising-tension-idUSKCN2240FS\">advancing its presence in the South China Sea.</a></p> <p>China claims ownership of much of the South China Sea, but this is disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia.</p> <p>State broadcaster CGTN<strong> </strong>said on Saturday that China had established administrative districts on the Paracel islands and Spratly islands, the site of overlapping ownership claims.</p> <p>Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the People\u2019s Liberation Army naval military studies research institute, told China\u2019s Global Times the new districts would \u201cfulfil the responsibility of safeguarding our national sovereignty\u201d and \u201cbring convenience to residents on the islands and fishermen\u2019s lives\u201d.</p> <p>Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry quickly accused China of having \u201cseriously violated its sovereignty\u201d, demanding it \u201cabolish its wrongful decisions\u201d.</p> <p>Last week a Chinese survey ship was seen tagging a Malaysian state oil company drillship, just north of Malaysia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, in disputed waters claimed by Vietnam and Malaysia.</p> <p>It also drew criticism from the US, but the Chinese foreign ministry accused US officials of smearing Beijing and said the vessel was conducting normal activities.</p> <p>US and Australian warships also arrived in the region this week.</p> <p>Vietnam also lodged a formal protest after a Chinese military ship rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel off the coast of the Paracels, in the second such confrontation in a year.</p> <h2>Buzzing Taiwan</h2> <p>China has also been <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3075526/taipei-says-chinese-military-aircraft-flew-night-exercise\">flying regular fighter patrols near Taiwan</a>, which China claims is part of its territory despite having not governed the island in modern times. In mid-March the People\u2019s Liberation Army sent warplanes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and briefly approached Taiwan. The move, which analysts said was at least partly to intimidate Taiwan, prompted Taiwan to scramble fighter planes to intercept.</p> <p>China is also <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/04/13/china-sends-aircraft-carrier-near-japan-taiwan-us-navy-struggles-coronavirus.html\">sending military flotillas</a> past Taiwan and Japan on a semi-regular basis. Last week a six-vessel strike group led by China\u2019s only aircraft carrier sailed through the Miyako Strait and past Taiwan, under watch by the Taiwanese and Japanese defence forces.</p> <p>In January, a military flotilla, again led by the aircraft carrier, passed through the straits of Taiwan. It didn\u2019t enter Taiwan\u2019s waters, but did cross its air defence identification zone.</p> <h2>Investing in India</h2> <p>Several countries <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-investments/india-toughens-rules-on-investments-from-neighbours-seen-aimed-at-china-idUSKBN2200LQ\">including India and Australia</a> have introduced new laws or regulations covering foreign investments amid concerns about Chinese acquisitions while nations and companies struggle during the pandemic.</p> <p>This month the People\u2019s Bank of China bought shares in HDFC, India\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, eventually obtaining more than 1%.</p> <p>Under the new laws in India, anyone from a country sharing a border with India needs government approval before any kind of investment, local media reported. While this included many nations, it has been seen as geared towards China, since it includes Hong Kong.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version said that China had never governed Taiwan. This has been corrected to say that it has not governed the island in modern times.</p>",

While Labor and unions welcomed the scheme, they criticised the exclusion of 1 million shorter-term casuals and 1.1 million temporary visa holders.</p> <p>Not every business can meet the 30% revenue downturn threshold to participate. Many industries are excluded explicitly, such as the public sector, including all local government employees, or in practice \u2013 such as those with high rates of contract work or short-term engagements including education, construction and the arts.

Here's everything you need to know to register</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Employment barrister Ian Neil says many employers are not applying for the scheme because they are concerned about uncertainty if they make a claim but then fall short of the 30% revenue reduction to be eligible.</p> <p>Neil says the Australian Tax Office has issued guidance that it will \u201csubstantially accept their self-assessment\u201d, provided the employer has an objective basis for predicting the revenue downturn and the assessment was reasonable. But most employers are unaware of this flexibility.</p> <p>The biggest hurdle is the month-long gap in payments that must be bridged. Although jobkeeper is backdated to 30 March, employers must stump up the $1,500 payment all through April until reimbursement in the first week of May in order to be eligible.</p> <p>The one-in all-in rule, that every eligible employee who nominates must be given a payment if the employer chooses to participate, prevents employers playing favourites and requires every worker to be paid.</p> <p>And because workers are entitled to $1,500 even if their regular pay packet is less, in many cases businesses will have a larger wage bill than usual, while suffering from the downturn.</p> <p>For Blossom McKenzie-King\u2019s employer, that month of above-average wage bills was the difference between dropping out and participating in the scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b21a389306cb033ad108d49247a1ecf00610d03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b21a389306cb033ad108d49247a1ecf00610d03/0_403_1184_1373/862.jpg\" alt=\"Blossom McKenzie-King\" width=\"862\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blossom McKenzie-King has worked for four years for a retailer in the CBD in Melbourne that could not afford to pay her until jobkeeper was reimbursed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Borsato/Blossom McKenzie-King</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McKenzie-King, who worked for four years in a retail store in Melbourne\u2019s CBD, tells Guardian Australia she and her co-workers \u201cgot all our hopes up\u201d when jobkeeper was announced. \u201cWe thought \u2018we\u2019ll be fine, and this is really good news for the employer too\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But the business, which had already suffered poor sales as bushfire smoke blanketed Melbourne over summer, did not have enough cash to pay McKenzie-King and others until jobkeeper was reimbursed.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking for my employer \u2013 they\u2019ve said they might not be able to reopen the store \u2026 and if another opportunity comes up I should take it.</p> <p>\u201cThey want to keep me employed, but it\u2019s hard to make promises when you can\u2019t be 100% sure you can keep them, when everything is so uncertain.

problem he faces is that the government\u2019s history in this area is littered with tech fails, data breaches and misuse of personal data.</p> \n<p>Less than two months ago, senior bureaucrats were

  "<p>The government is \u201creviewing\u201d the surcharge that some migrant doctors and nurses working in the NHS must pay to access the health service, the home secretary Priti Patel has said.</p> <p>In the daily press conference at Downing Street on Saturday, after the UK became the fifth country to pass 20,000 total deaths from coronavirus \u2013 behind the US, Italy, Spain and France \u2013 Patel reiterated the government\u2019s stay-at-home message and rejected suggestions that allowing non-essential work to continue sent mixed messages.</p> <p>The government has been criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\">for planning to increase the immigration health surcharge for migrants</a> from outside the European Economic Area, including nurses and doctors, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 a year each from October. The fees were introduced in 2015.</p> <p>The move was described as a perverse deterrent to workers the government needed to attract, and there have been reports of nurses facing fees of thousands of pounds a year in both visa charges and the surcharge so they and their families can access the health service and remain in the UK.</p> <p>Asked if this was the right time to abolish it for NHS workers, Patel said: \u201cYou\u2019ll be aware of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">many changes</a> we have already made around the immigration status, the visa status for NHS workers, extending their visas already if they were coming up for expiry.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of March, the Home Office said that NHS workers \u2013 and their family members \u2013 would automatically have their visas extended free of charge for one year.</p> <p>Speaking at the daily briefing for the first time, Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), also warned that \u201camoral, corrupt and exploitative\u201d criminals were seeking to take advantage of the crisis.</p> <p>More than 2,000 online scams relating to coronavirus have been taken down including fake shops selling bogus testing kits and PPE, she said.</p> <p>Patel sought to warn criminals seeking to exploit the current situation that they would be pursued. She said the NCA had flagged up 1,300 possible child sexual offences to police.</p> <p>In her closing remarks, the home secretary said: \u201cAny criminal seeking to exploit this virus for their own gain, our outstanding police and law enforcement agencies are absolutely on to you.\u201d</p> <p>The press conference came amid apparent concern in government about waning respect for physical distancing measures.</p> <p>NHS England\u2019s medical director, Stephen Powis, exhibited a slide showing a slight increase in the number of journeys taken and warned people to avoid travel and to physically distance \u2013 with the measures now in place until at least 7 May \u2013 during the UK\u2019s fifth weekend under lockdown.</p> <p>The Home Office said: \u201cWe are immensely grateful for the work NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics are doing to tackle coronavirus, and this is why we applied a one-year visa extension to all those whose visas are due to expire before 1 October 2020 \u2013 this is completely free of charge and includes an exemption from the immigration health surcharge.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to look at whether we can provide further assistance during the fight against this virus.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2020. An earlier version said the UK had become the fifth country to pass 20,000 deaths in hospital from coronavirus. This should have referred to all deaths, not just those in hospital. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The global toll from Covid-19 passed 200,000 on Saturday, with over 2.8 million people infected, as the WHO warned against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d because there is no evidence people who recovered from the disease are protected against a second infection.</p> <p>It took more than three months after the coronavirus first emerged for deaths from the disease to pass 100,000, a grim milestone that was reached on 10 April. It took just over two weeks for that toll to double, and worldwide the number of confirmed infections is creeping towards 3 million.</p> <p>Pressure is mounting on authorities to bring socially and economically costly lockdowns to an end, but most governments are acting only after they believe the virus is under control in their territory.</p> <p>India, Greece and Belgium were the latest countries to announce a tentative easing of restrictions, but said these first steps can be reversed if cases start to rise again.</p> <p>The Belgian prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, said it was \u201ctime to look to the future\u201d as she announced that outdoor sports will be permitted and certain shops including garden centres will be allowed to lift the shutters from 4 May.</p> <p>A week later, all shops will reopen and some school classes will recommence, with the wearing of masks will be mandatory on public transport. If the country has avoided a second wave of coronavirus infections, restaurants could open in June.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do (this) because the figures show that we were able to slow down the spread of Covid-19 in Belgium. But the virus hasn\u2019t disappeared yet. It\u2019s still present and dangerous for the population,\u201d Wilm\u00e8s said.</p> <p>In Greece reopening is expected from Monday 4 May, when small shops, hairdressers, barbers and beauticians will be to go back to work again. \u201cThe objective of the confinement measures is not to remain in a glass bowl,\u201d government spokesman Stelios Petsas said earlier this week. \u201cThe objective is to take back our lives.\u201d</p> <p>The centre right administration took a \u201chard and early\u201d approach to enforcing restrictions, amid fears of Greece\u2019s austerity-hit health system being quickly overwhelmed. As a result Greece, to date, has had a sum total of 2,490 confirmed coronavirus cases and 130 fatalities.</p> <p>However, Hong Kong\u2019s top epidemiologist has warned against easing lockdowns in Europe too soon, saying \u201cyou need a sledgehammer\u201d to bring down the rate of infections first.</p> <p>Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, told Der Spiegel that lockdowns will be \u201ca marathon, not a sprint\u201d, and that the world needs to learn to live with the coronavirus, tightening and easing restrictions as outbreaks emerge.</p> <p>\u201cContainment has failed everywhere,\u201d Leung said. \u201cWhat we need is suppression, or better: cycles of suppression and lift, probably many of them,\u201d he said. He added that measures needed to be tuned to the \u201csurge capacity\u201d of national health systems.</p> <p>One region that appears to have been relatively successful so far in containment efforts is Africa, with strict lockdowns across the continent apparently halting the spread of the virus and staving off a feared spike in infections.</p> <p>South Africa will begin lifting lockdown restrictions from 1 May although people will have to wear face masks in public when they go out. Nigerian state governors have also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to approve the compulsory use of face masks in public as confirmed cases rise.</p> <p>South and Central America by contrast are experiencing a significant crisis, with Brazil emerging as a major epidemic hotspot. Cases of Covid-19 are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries, even as President Jair Bolsonaro insists it is a relatively minor disease.</p> <p>Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients, the AP reported.</p> <p>In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day, triple the pre-virus average of burials.</p> <p>After global incredulity at US President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that ingesting or injecting bleach could prevent or cure coronavirus, which he later disowned as \u201csarcasm\u201d, the search for cures or prophylactics continues.</p> <p>The French government is limiting the sale of products containing nicotine after reports from a Paris hospital that it may reduce the risk of catching the coronavirus.</p> <p>Described by the French health authorities as \u201cjust a hypothesis\u201d, clinical trials of nicotine patches are to be carried out, but in order to prevent people self-medicating a new decree declared that pharmacies were instructed to limit the sale of products containing nicotine - patches, chewing gum and lozenges - to one month\u2019s supply.</p> <p>As the international debate about the origins and spread of the virus continues, Reuters has reported that China sought to block a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend Europe time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak scrambles international relations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/brett-crozier-us-navy-seeks-to-reinstate-captain-demoted-over-covid-19\">Brett Crozier: US navy seeks to reinstate captain demoted over Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-leader-group-peddling-bleach-cure-lobbied-trump-coronavirus\">Revealed: leader of group peddling bleach as coronavirus 'cure' wrote to Trump this week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other coronavirus developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/brett-crozier-us-navy-seeks-to-reinstate-captain-demoted-over-covid-19\">The US navy is seeking to reinstate the fired captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt</a>, whose crew hailed him as their hero for risking his job to safeguard their lives from coronavirus, officials have said.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Nearly 60 new cases of coronavirus infections have been confirmed in Nagasaki among crew members of an Italian cruise ship docked there for repairs, Japanese domestic media has reported.

He calmly enters the Spurs half, takes a look around, and sprays a pinpoint pass to McGrath on the right touchline. Thomas is nowhere near him. McGrath makes it all the way to the edge of the Spurs box, level with the six-yard line. He looks for Pickering in the middle, but Mabbutt, desperately tracking back, sticks out his left leg in the hope of blocking and bundling out for a corner. He had to attempt the interception, but it doesn\u2019t work out. The ball slices off his left kneecap and sails along a perplexing parabola, looping over the helpless Clemence and into the top left!

The tussle ends with Allen clambering all over Peake\u2019s back, ending up horizontal in mid-air, posing in the Superman position as his opponent keeps hold of him with a smile. They spin round so everyone can get the joke before Peake plops him softly back down to earth. A couple of friendly pats are exchanged, and we\u2019re on our way again.

Such a well-timed challenge. He rolls a pass up the centre for Hoddle, who spins and draws his man, before flicking the ball past him for Ardiles, who has kept running and is now in a lot of space. He\u2019s got Paul Allen to his right, and a flick inside will send the midfielder clear on goal. Peake sticks out a boot, it\u2019s all he can do. And he manages to deflect the ball away from Allen and back to Ogrizovic. What an interception! And that should be the end of that, but Coventry, attempting to play out from the back in the continental style, nearly concede in farcical circumstances! Ogrizovic, taking reception of a backpass, decides to go on a C64 International Soccer style dribble upfield! He eventually clanks a dreadful pass straight to Hoddle, who attempts to dispatch it into the unguarded net from 40 yards. Fortunately for the keeper, Peake has read the danger and is back covering. He blocks and taps the ball to the right, assuming his keeper will flop on it when he gets back to his box. But Ogrizovic somehow overruns it, and Peake\u2019s lay off isn\u2019t perfect either, and Clive Allen scampers away with the ball! The net\u2019s still unguarded, but Allen is forced wide by Peake and lashes the ball into the side netting. Coventry dodged a bullet there.

The ball drops to Phillips, who has a dig. That\u2019s blocked, but Coventry come back again. Spurs can\u2019t get out! Kilcline rolls a pass to Downs on the left touchline. Downs one-twos with Regis, then sends a cross in from a deep position. Houchen rises above Ardiles - hardly a fair fight - to flick on. The ball falls perfectly to the feet of Bennett, eight yards out.

Cutting-edge entertainment that earned a thumbs-up from this very paper: <strike> \u201cMy hovercraft is full of eels.\u201d </strike> \u201cMonty Python gets better and better!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Also part of that episode: World Forum, with guests Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Che Guevara and Mao Zedong. </strong>Ostensibly a summit meeting of political heavyweights, it quickly transpires that World Forum is in fact a quiz, and most of the questions are about football, stumping the communist intellectuals entirely. Quizmaster Eric Idle asks Guevara: \u201cCoventry City last won the FA Cup in what year?\u201d A look of bewilderment washes across the revolutionary\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised you didn\u2019t get that,\u201d Idle smiles unctuously. \u201cIt was in fact a trick question, Coventry City have never won the FA Cup.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sixteen-and-a-half years on, Coventry finally have the chance to ruin that particular punchline for eternity. </strong>They\u2019ve reached the FA Cup final for the very first time in their 104-year history. In some style, too, winning at Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday, then seeing off Billy Bremner\u2019s resurgent Leeds United in a five-goal thriller at Hillsborough. George Curtis and John Sillett\u2019s team have enlivened this year\u2019s FA Cup from the get-go; only the partial would begrudge them a maiden victory today. They go into this final as underdogs, and as such a fair chunk of the nation will be behind them this afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Mind you, plenty of neutrals will be behind Tottenham Hotspur as well. </strong>David Pleat\u2019s team have been this season\u2019s most entertaining side by some distance, Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle mesmerising, Clive Allen relentless. But much good it\u2019s done them so far. Everton outlasted them in the race for the title, while Arsenal won a Littlewoods Cup semi-final marathon of such rich narrative bedlam that somebody very clever will surely base a book around it some day. In a parallel universe, Spurs are looking to complete an unprecedented domestic treble; back on Planet Reality, they\u2019re searching for that elusive piece of silverware, just one prize to reward their stellar efforts during the season. Most expect them to get the job done today, especially as Tottenham\u2019s record in FA Cup finals is sheer perfection: seven wins out of seven.</p> <p><strong>But this is the FA Cup, and you just never know. </strong>Kick off is at 3pm.

  "<p>Far-right movements are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to push their anti-minority agendas and win new support.</p> <p>A report by Zinc Network, <a href=\"https://zincnetwork.com/\">a communications agency</a> that tracks disinformation and propaganda, suggests there has been a clear pivot among far-right groups in the UK, EU and US to \u201cutilise the pandemic to bring new relevancy, attention and support for their key grievances\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence we\u2019ve uncovered shows that far-right groups in the UK are using Covid-19 to promote a British form of fascism,\u201d said Louis Brooke, executive director of research and strategy at Zinc Network.</p> <p>\u201cTheir tactics are sophisticated, and their activity is becoming more difficult to monitor, partly due to the use of private messaging apps to share disinformation and propaganda. We\u2019re seeing the dissemination of material claiming that immigrants spread coronavirus, and that authoritarian regimes outperform western liberal democracies in tackling the health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Zinc Network said British far-right groups such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/28/britain-first-far-right-members-5000-have-joined-tories\">Britain First</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/11/how-britains-extremist-bloggers-helped-the-alt-right-go-global\">Knights Templar International</a>, as well as the BNP\u2019s former leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/01/nick-griffin-expelled-from-bnp\">Nick Griffin</a>, have used the crisis to promote themselves as supporters of the community during the lockdown. Griffin has posted images of himself on social media distributing food parcels.</p> <p>Zinc Network, which in the past has attracted scrutiny for its work promoting the Home Office\u2019s anti-radicalisation strategy, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent</a>, studied social media posts, photos, videos, journals, official records and media reports to produce the analysis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Their tactics are sophisticated and their activity is becoming more difficult to monitor</p> <footer> <cite>Louise Brooke, Zinc Network</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It said one key narrative being pushed by the far right is that the spread of coronavirus is the consequence of illegal immigration. Allied to this is the claim that nations with tightly-controlled borders are better prepared to deal with the pandemic. Another is the premise that modern liberal states are on the verge of collapse, and that their fall can be accelerated through armed action or by a major crisis.</p> <p>The promotion of survivalist material by far-right groups is also becoming a trend. Zinc says neo-Nazi publisher Arktos has been publishing updated and expanded editions of far-right survivalist texts.</p> <p>A favoured tactic among far-right groups is to put fake documents into circulation, designed to look like real medical or government communications. According to Zinc\u2019s monitoring, far-right Telegram channels have been instrumental in circulating a fake scan of a positive Covid-19 test for the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-donald-trump-delay-election\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>The same channels have also been distributing government pandemic response documents with a view to helping would-be attackers plan their actions.</p> <p>Some far-right organisations are using the crisis to impersonate other groups, Zinc claims. Fake Extinction Rebellion flyers have been found in several cities in the UK proclaiming \u201cCorona is the cure \u2013 humans are the disease\u201d.</p> <p>Most of the leaflets condemn immigration, with some calling for the public to \u201clearn about the JQ\u201d \u2013 the \u201cJewish question\u201d. Others promote conspiracy theories or deny the Russian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/salisbury-poisoning-suspect-is-russian-colonel-reports\">novichok attack in Salisbury</a>.</p> <p>Brooke said: \u201cThese extremist groups are using the coronavirus as an opportunity to further their ideological objectives by spreading fear and division and exacerbating social tensions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>It\u2019s hard, stuck inside for weeks on end, not to notice how much your four walls could do with some paint \u2013 if, like me, you haven\u2019t had them done for a while. To be honest, it\u2019s been troubling me for ages \u2013 lockdown has just made it worse. As long ago as February I\u2019d wandered into a <a href=\"https://www.farrow-ball.com/\" title=\"\">Farrow &amp; Ball</a> shop wanting advice for my daughter\u2019s small bedroom. It was still decorated for a young child, but she\u2019s 16 now and she yearned for something more grown-up \u2013 a calming escape where she could study and relax with friends. And I spied on a Farrow &amp; Ball noticeboard an advertisement for their colour consultancy service.</p> <p>Colour curator Joa Studholme has worked at Farrow &amp; Ball for 24 years, inventing colours that have become legendary among decorators, including the charming Nancy\u2019s Blushes, named after her daughter\u2019s pink cheeks.</p> <p>She started advising on decorating after her children were born, having previously worked in advertising. This unlocked a real passion for colour. \u201cWhen I was a child, I was obsessed with colour,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father bought me a box of <a href=\"https://www.carandache.com/gb/en/\" title=\"\">Caran d\u2019Ache</a> crayons and it was literally my pride and joy. I would spend hours rearranging them in the tin. At 12, I painted my ceiling yellow because I wanted it to be sunny, and I painted the inside of my cupboard in stripes.\u201d</p> <p>What would she recommend for us? Our house is a typical London Victorian terrace. It\u2019s painted in various shades of elegant off-white that my husband says have always bored him. As she enters our porch \u2013 pre-lockdown \u2013 she exclaims: \u201cOh, this is crying out for colour!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0c4bdbc711e0148384fb387d106e3c55633cf56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0c4bdbc711e0148384fb387d106e3c55633cf56/0_274_1200_1226/979.jpg\" alt=\"Let the light in: the walls are painted in Dimpse; the Woodwork is All White; and the floor is Down Pipe.\" width=\"979\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let the light in: the walls are painted in Dimpse; the woodwork is All White; and the floor is Down Pipe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Merrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She sets off for a wander through the house, notebook in hand. At the end, she lines up colour swatches on large pieces of card representing a harmonious journey through the house: muted whites, grey-blues, pinks and greens, yellow and black. For my daughter\u2019s room, she chooses a wonderful dusky pink that she devised and named Peignoir \u2013 feminine but not sugary \u2013 which she promises will turn to grey in the afternoon light. \u201cIt has a big dose of black in it,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>Joa adds an accent of a darker pink (Sulking Room Pink) behind the bookshelves. \u201cI love adding bits of hidden colour, where you\u2019re not expecting it. It\u2019s the equivalent of a bright green lining in a sober black suit.\u201d</p> <p>Painting a house from top to bottom is expensive. So we pick out a few key rooms to focus on. An easy start is the front door and porch. She recommends creating a space quite distinct from the open living room that comes after by painting the front door (inside and out) and inside the porch in a blueish grey called Pigeon. For the small downstairs loo, currently a pale blue that feels cold in winter, she selects a deep muddy pink (Dead Salmon).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"08f30435cf21ce749968778e6d6c094eec1c303a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f30435cf21ce749968778e6d6c094eec1c303a/0_0_4789_7176/667.jpg\" alt=\"Shades of perfection: Dead Salmon in the kitchen.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shades of perfection: Dead Salmon in the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Merrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our next project is the office in the converted loft, where my husband says he\u2019d like yellow. Fine, says Joa. Being at the top of the house, the office is a kind of final destination rather than a part of the journey through the house, and needn\u2019t conform so closely to the overall colour mix. She prescribes a cheerful shade called Hay for the walls and ceiling, with a few accents of dark brown on woodwork. He looks delighted.</p> <p>The most dramatic elements are the staircase spindles (currently white), which she\u2019d like to see painted deepest black (Railings). This, she says, will give a structure rising all the way up the house.</p> <p>\u201cYour house is a treasure chest of opportunity,\u201d says Joa. \u201cI am not in the game of changing things for the sake of it. I want to create something you\u2019ll be comfortable with, to reflect your personality, but with a bit more character. To make you smile!\u201d</p> <p>But the colour should make its presence felt differently in each space. For our bedroom, she suggests a soft mix of blues and greens (Cromarty and Grey Blue), \u201cso you barely notice the colours and your shoulders relax as soon as you step into the room.\u201d</p> <p>The aim in these troubled times, says Joa, is to create a sense of wellbeing, as though your house is giving you a hug. \u201cThere has been a seismic shift in the way we are using colour in the home,\u201d she says. \u201cThe huge popularity of the neutral home is on the wane. When the world is in turmoil, what better way to comfort ourselves than embracing stronger colours that have an air of nostalgia and nourish not only our homes but also our souls?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she has ever made mistakes with colour. \u201cI did once make a big mistake with the children\u2019s bathroom. I wanted to make it look like a 1950s caravan. I used Churlish Green, which has yellow in it. When the children got in the bath, they looked so ill! I had to change it quickly.\u201d She painted it pink instead, \u201cwhich made them look very bonny\u201d. Now our Pigeon-coloured porch is bonny, too.</p> <h2>Colour codes: Joa Studholme\u2019s easy rules for living with brighter hues</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91977f9c4aa642f57227adb98df1a81592da8ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91977f9c4aa642f57227adb98df1a81592da8ff8/0_419_3744_4569/819.jpg\" alt=\"Can of red paint and paintbrush cut out isolated on white backgroundB40HY1 Can of red paint and paintbrush cut out isolated on white background\" width=\"819\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red alert: If you are wary of colour, start by using stronger tones in smaller places.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1.</strong> There are three basic ways of decorating: a) using colour on the wall and a complementary white on the woodwork; b) using the lightest colour on the walls and a darker tone on the woodwork; and c) use one colour on both walls and woodwork.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> If you have an entrance hall or porch, then consider painting it a dark colour. You will create some drama on entrance and everything after it will feel lighter.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Think about the light and how and when you use different rooms. Large, light rooms used during the day usually work best in a light colour, while darker, smaller rooms painted in strong tones create inviting spaces for you to retire to at the end of the day.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> If you are wary of colour, start by using stronger tones in smaller places, like the back of a bookcase or even inside a cupboard.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Strong colours are much easier to live with when they are used below the eyeline. More dramatic colours used on kitchen islands and the underside of baths is a classic way to ground a room and add a little bit of excitement.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> If you have a low ceiling, paint your skirting and your coving the same colour as the walls to maximise the height.</p> <p><em>A Farrow &amp; Ball in-home colour consultation costs from \u00a3195 per hour.

  "<p>The US shale industry was forecast to deliver record high oil production this year. Only a few months ago the Permian basin was expected to increase its oil output to a new high of 4.8 million barrels per day, on the way to spurring the entire US market to a record daily output rate of 9 million bpd in 2020.</p> <p>The Permian, North America\u2019s largest shale basin, has been one of the biggest drivers of a shale oil boom that helped make the United States the biggest oil producer in the world, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p> <p>Instead, the region \u2013 which stretches from western Texas to eastern New Mexico \u2013 has endured its biggest one-month production decline in history. Now observers expect to see a string of oil-well closures, rising debts and bankruptcies as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/oil-prices-slump-as-market-faces-lowest-demand-in-25-years-covid-19\" title=\"\">the coronavirus pandemic slashes demand for crude</a> and threatens to wipe out hundreds of startup frackers. Suddenly, reaching 9 million bpd has become highly unlikely.</p> <p>The impact of the virus has slashed demand for oil across the globe, triggering a race to fill the world\u2019s remaining storage facilities with unwanted crude to avoid shutting down wells entirely In the US, this has forced producers to pay customers to take their barrels, and caused the worst price collapse in market history.</p> <p>\u201cThe current price environment is more or less a complete disaster for the majority of shale companies,\u201d says Artem Abramov, head of global shale research at the consultancy Rystad Energy. \u201cAt $30 a barrel, many companies would be able to adapt gradually.

The 450-mile journey was ostensibly the result of her recent decision to move in with her elderly, widowed father (alone of her siblings, she was able to to do this, being single and self-employed). But in truth it wasn\u2019t the only reason; another, almost equally powerful force was also in play. In the three decades since she\u2019d last lived there, Klein had never been able fully to shake off the spell cast by High Sunderland, the house in question. Wherever she went, whatever she did, it was always at the back of her mind, to the point where she wondered whether her feelings for it were entirely rational. Can a house be loved as a person is? Perhaps not. All she knew was that it was a part of her, just as it was a part of her father.</p> <p>Adults who return home often revert to being teenagers \u2013 we\u2019ve all done it, even in the course only of a long weekend \u2013 and our parents, too, tend to talk to us just as they always did once we\u2019re over the threshold. In the first moments after her arrival at High Sunderland, Shelley drank in its old, familiar smells: paprika, woodsmoke, freshly ground coffee. But the mood didn\u2019t last long. Carrying her possessions from van to house, her father was horrified to see among them a Victorian chair \u2013 a piece of furniture he unhesitatingly deemed to be \u201cghastly\u201d. Nor was he pleased to see her arranging a collection of potted herbs on the kitchen windowsill. Couldn\u2019t she put them elsewhere? For instance, in her bedroom. Irritated, Shelley asked what he had against them. \u201cThey\u2019re messy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey spoil the line of the house.\u201d In his eyes, only chives, a pleasingly \u201cvertical\u201d plant, could ever be even vaguely acceptable as interior decoration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4f499a62c0968ca0c8b96b581a63a0151e9b119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4f499a62c0968ca0c8b96b581a63a0151e9b119/0_0_2478_2643/938.jpg\" alt=\"At home in High Sunderland: Bernat Klein with his wife, Peggy, and daughters, Gillian and Shelley, c1966\" width=\"938\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At home in High Sunderland: Bernat Klein with his wife, Peggy, and daughters, Gillian and Shelley, c1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the Klein family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shelley\u2019s father, who died in 2014, was <a href=\"https://www.nms.ac.uk/explore-our-collections/stories/art-and-design/bernat-klein-collection/\">Bernat Klein</a>, a Serbian-born textile designer whose fabrics were popular in the 60s with such designers as Chanel and Dior. But while his adventures in tweed and mohair were both a commercial and a critical success, his greatest and most lasting achievement is surely the house he commissioned from a young British architect, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/22/peter-womersley-bauhaus-boiler-house-melrose\">Peter Womersley</a>, on which building work began in 1956: <a href=\"https://www.themodernhouse.com/journal/open-house-shelley-klein-on-klein-house-and-life-in-a-mid-century-masterpiece/\">a glass house set in woodland</a> between Peebles and Selkirk that a friend of the family once described as \u201ca Mondrian set within a Klimt\u201d. Built in a modernist vernacular, High Sunderland, which is now listed, comprises in essence two wings within which sit various courtyards; these work as extensions of the interior, being either roofed or pergolas. It is, in some ways, a very straightforward building: a simple pavilion constructed of wood and glass. But it\u2019s also exquisite: an essay in abstraction. Its strength and beauty come first from the contrast between solid and void, and second (at least in Shelley\u2019s day) from the colours Bernat brought into its interior: its floor of creamy Italian travertine; the fabrics, orange-red and mustard-yellow, that covered its purpose-built sofas. Finally, there is its isolated setting. High Sunderland is entirely surrounded by mature trees.</p> <p>Not that nature was always popular with Bernat. In <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-see-through-house-9781784743109.html\">The See-Through House</a></em>, her new memoir, Shelley describes how she once found him outside, bottle of bleach in hand, scrubbing at the bark of a silver birch. What was he doing? she wondered. \u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d he shot back. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get rid of the lichen. We planted these trees to reflect the white columns of the house. Now all this green stuff is spoiling them.\u201d From the day he first took possession of High Sunderland until the day that he left it, shortly before he died, Bernat was every bit as passionate about its design as the architect who\u2019d dreamed it up. It was, to him, perfection \u2013 and perfection was a state that required total vigilance. \u201cWhile I had a yearning to go back there, living with him was quite tough,\u201d his daughter tells me now. \u201cMuch as I loved him, he wasn\u2019t the easiest person.\u201d The house was his work of art, and anyone who dared to change even the tiniest thing might as well have been doodling on <em>Guernica</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eab7ab4a4d2c549ced5c2d22071796811f3569d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eab7ab4a4d2c549ced5c2d22071796811f3569d4/110_111_1695_2118/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bernat Klein\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Disorder made him quite upset\u2019: Bernat Klein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chatto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s strange, though, is that in the six years since his death, her father\u2019s influence on Shelley has grown rather than diminished. When they lived together, her mode was rebellious. High Sunderland was also easy to divide in two; she was able to have her own sitting room, in which it was up to her if she left a trail of possessions on the floor. \u201cBut now I find it comforting to live more like he used to,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m more inclined to clear mess up quickly. I find myself tidying cupboards. Perhaps it\u2019s another way of keeping him alive.\u201d Today in her north London flat \u2013 High Sunderland was sold in 2018 \u2013 she is surrounded by Bernat\u2019s things: his paintings, some of which inspired his fabric designs; the bottles he collected and liked to arrange into Morandi-style groupings; a sculpture that was once in the garden. And this, too, is a surprise. For a long time, the thought of packing up High Sunderland was unimaginable. Its contents seemed to belong to it so absolutely; the idea of taking them elsewhere was akin, in her mind, to performing \u201can organ transplant\u201d.</p> <p>After her father\u2019s death, she knew the house would have to be sold; it was too expensive for her, a freelance writer, to run alone, and, disappointingly, the National Trust of Scotland elected not to take it on. The process of doing so was distressing. \u201cIt was important to find the right buyers, and we were fortunate: those who bid the most were also those most likely to treasure it. But when I spent a day with them, showing them how it worked, occasionally they would say \u2018oh, we\u2019d like to do this, or that\u2019 \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d What about moving day? \u201cIt was agonising,\u201d she says, softly. \u201cIt still is agonising.\u201d Has she been back since? \u201cNo. I won\u2019t go back. I can\u2019t\u2026 It\u2019s too painful.\u201d A tear rolls down her cheek \u2013 one fat enough to be clearly visible on Zoom (we\u2019re communicating online). \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It surprises me how painful it still is. No, to see it would be like rubbing salt into my wounds. I like to think about it the way I remember it.\u201d If she\u2019d been filthy rich would she have stayed on? Would she be there even now? She smiles. \u201cOh, yes. Of course I would.\u201d</p> <p>Bernat Klein\u2019s story makes the creation of High Sunderland seem all the more unlikely \u2013 and yet, it also goes some way to explaining it. Born in a town called Senta, in a region of the Austro-Hungarian empire that became part of Yugoslavia in 1918, his family were Orthodox Jews who ran a textile business. Bernat was particularly close to his mother, Zori, and his childhood was idyllic. But it came to a sudden end when he was 14 and his father, Lipot, sent him to a yeshiva in Galanta, Czechoslovakia, where he was required to study nothing but the Talmud from dawn till dusk, and where he was extremely homesick. Alas, there was no way out. Two years later, his father moved him even further afield, to Jerusalem, where he would be taught at another yeshiva by the city\u2019s chief rabbi \u2013 a man with whose family he would lodge. This time, when he said goodbye to Zori, he knew he would not see her again for at least two years.</p> <p>Bernat arrived in Mea Shearim, an ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem, in 1938, and from the first moment he was uncomfortable. He found it drab and restrictive, and he increasingly loathed his studies, the never-ending analysis of a seemingly never-ending text. He began to slip out of the yeshiva, exploring the rest of the city, taking delight in its bookshops and markets; he also began to question his faith. When a cousin of Zori\u2019s who was living in Palestine suggested that he apply for a place at the Bezalel School of Arts, he was receptive \u2013 and soon afterwards, he daringly walked away from the yeshiva for ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44a5ac4a6bae4af536420b035d399cfe5f91eb04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a5ac4a6bae4af536420b035d399cfe5f91eb04/209_348_3334_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family portrait of Bernat Klein (second right) with his brother Moshe and parents Zori and Lipot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family portrait of Bernat Klein (second right) with his brother Moshe and his parents Zori and Lipot in the late 1920s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chatto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He loved life at Bezalel \u2013 what a pleasure to use his eyes and hands like this \u2013 though if he was serious about a career in textiles, he was told, he would need to continue his studies in Britain. This he duly did, enrolling on a course at Leeds University. But it was by now 1945. Just before his departure, he received a letter, the first from a member of his family in over three years. His brother, Moshe, who was living in a refugee camp outside Senta, wrote to explain how the family had been rounded up by the Germans; only he had managed to escape. Lipot had since made the journey back from Auschwitz, but he was the only one. Bernat travelled to Leeds in the knowledge that Zori was unlikely to be alive.</p> <p>It was in Leeds that he met Peggy, Shelley\u2019s mother, later a knitwear designer; they married in 1951, and spent part of their honeymoon at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/gallery/2017/may/01/jane-bown-photographs-festival-of-britain-1951\">Festival of Britain</a>. After finishing his degree, Bernat worked in two knitwear factories, the second of which was in Galashiels, Scotland, the town in which he then established his company, <a href=\"https://www.maharam.com/stories/rawsthorn_bernat-klein-and-colourcraft\">Colourcraft</a>, which made scarves and other items for Woolworths and Marks &amp; Spencer. It grew so fast, he soon bought his own mill, Netherdale \u2013 and it was on Netherdale\u2019s looms that Colourcraft produced a tweed in shades of yellow and gold, orange and green that Coco Chanel used for a suit in her spring collection of 1963. Suddenly, Bernat was on his way. By July of the same year, Pierre Cardin, Christian Dior, Louis F\u00e9raud, Guy Laroche, Nina Ricci, Yves Saint Laurent and Hardy Amies had all placed orders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Taste was his religion... it also came from his mother. He'd describe how she dressed, matching her clothes to her eye and hair colour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But we\u2019re running ahead. In 1955, Peggy and Bernat were driving near Holmfirth in West Yorkshire when they spotted an extraordinary building through the trees: a house that turned out to be <a href=\"http://midcenturymagazine.com/architecture/modern-house-farnley-hey/\">Farnley Hey</a>, which an architect called Peter Womersley had designed as a wedding present for his brother, John. Bernat immediately wrote to Womersley, asking if he would work on something similar for him in the Scottish Borders, where he\u2019d recently bought a plot of land. For Womersley, an admirer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/21/frank-lloyd-wright-fantasist-or-genius-exhibition-moma-new-york\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> and of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/dec/08/1\">Mies van der Rohe</a>, this would be his first professional commission. It would also be the start of his lifelong friendship with Bernat (he later built a house for himself close to High Sunderland).</p> <p>Did the house represent order, after the chaos of the war? \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d Shelley says. \u201cLosing contact, not knowing where anyone was: that had a huge impact on him, and the house was a reply, of sorts, to it. I can\u2019t describe enough how uncomfortable disorder made him; he would get quite upset if he felt things weren\u2019t right.\u201d But where did his taste come from? Not many people in the Borders of the 1950s longed to own a chair by Poul Kjaerholm (in High Sunderland\u2019s hall there stood just such a piece of furniture, constructed of metal and rope, on which no coat was ever to be placed, and no bottom ever to be lowered). Nor did they take such exception, as Bernat would do a little later, to the romantic whims of Laura Ashley (when the teenage Shelley wore a much-loved dress by the Welsh designer \u2013 long and mauve and covered with yellow rosebuds \u2013 her father told her that she looked like \u201ca Victorian toilet\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bf2aa828d29fcd7f50f51bab23f40b73c30597d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bf2aa828d29fcd7f50f51bab23f40b73c30597d/242_876_5159_3784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelley Klein, photographed earlier this year.

He would describe how she used to dress, matching her clothes to her eye and hair colour \u2013 and her home, which she made so comfortable. That was the initial influence. He came more slowly to modern design.\u201d What about Peggy? Was she as keen a modernist as Bernat, or did she just go along with him? (In her book, Shelley describes Peggy\u2019s renegade cupboards, which contained contraband in the form of \u201cforbidden\u201d items such as pretty china.) \u201cShe\u2019d always lived in Victorian houses before she met him, and I think she would have been just as happy in one had she married someone else. But when she fell in love with him, she was head over heels: anything he said, it was like God had spoken. She embraced their lifestyle fully.\u201d</p> <p>As a teenager, Shelley would have preferred to live somewhere like her school friends: a house with an attic; a house where it was possible to have secrets. Her pals, she says, mostly took High Sunderland in their stride, though its underfloor heating was always popular at a time and in a place where chilblains were a constant hazard. But there is also no doubting that seen from the outside, the Kleins\u2019 world was a glamorous one, their house a kind of stage set for her father\u2019s fashion shows; for the parties her parents liked to throw, gatherings at which modish guests smoked Gitanes and drank cocktails with maraschino cherries in them. \u201cYou\u2019ve hit on something,\u201d she says, when I tell her that I think of High Sunderland rising up among the trees like some fairytale castle, albeit one minus any turrets or castellations. \u201cPeople did fall under its spell, my father\u2019s way of seeing things.\u201d</p> <p>She misses it. No other house \u2013 no other home \u2013 can ever, for her, compete with it. But she visits it often in her mind. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that passes when I\u2019m not there,\u201d she says, with a smile. What does she see on these trips? \u201cWell, I come in and\u2026 from the hall, I can see the blue of the kitchen floor; the tiles are the colour of bluebells. Then I go into the living room, and there it is, the landscape beyond the huge windows; it\u2019s so light and peaceful, and the fireplace makes it so warm. After this, I go into the dining room. Whenever I went home, my parents would always make the same dish for me: chicken paprikash and a cucumber salad that was particular to my father. So I\u2019d get a big waft of that\u2026\u201d Just for a moment, she closes her eyes.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-see-through-house-9781784743109.html\">The See-Through House</a></em> by Shelley Klein is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a316.99).

I mean the strategies adopted by the central European dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s (which is not to equate authoritarian state socialism with the US today). After the failure of many reform efforts, Adam Michnik and other intellectuals concluded that the oppressive regimes were never going to change. The dissidents stopped talking to state leaders and resolved instead to \u201ctalk past them\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292994/postwar-by-tony-judt/\">as the historian Tony Judt put it</a>), trying to reach as many citizens as possible in spite of restrictions on speech. They also started to create what V\u00e1clav Benda called a <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781349111190\">\u201cparallel polis\u201d</a> \u2013 a world in which one tried to act as if one was already free. These civil society initiatives undermined the regimes without ever confronting them head-on.</p> <p>What is the lesson? There is no point talking to Trump, because he will not change; every seemingly sober presidential moment \u2013 cheered by centrist observers \u2013 is followed by 10 puerile performances of ranting and raving. There will never be a Gotcha moment, because Trump\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d is apparently committed to him no matter what; even his diehard fans\u2019 most basic interests \u2013 such as not dying (never mind their economic interests) \u2013 will apparently not detract from their identification with a figure who, if nothing else, looks like a trustworthy general in the culture war.</p> <p>It is possible, to pick up an idea from the media critic Jay Rosen, <a href=\"https://pressthink.org/2020/04/five-improvements-in-the-design-of-coronavirus-coverage/\">to \u201cdecenter\u201d Trump</a>.

The fact that some do not have the resources, because Mitch McConnell would rather <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/22/mitch-mcconnell-bankruptcy-route-201008\">have blue states go bankrupt than save lives</a>, should be exposed as further proof that the Republicans have comprehensively turned into the party of cruelty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democrats may worry that providing alternative leadership is seen as divisive.

When Andr\u00e9s<em> </em>Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador contested the outcome of the 2006 election in Mexico (which he narrowly lost), he declared himself the \u201clegitimate president of Mexico\u201d and had his followers camp out to protest in the middle of Mexico City. And in the weeks after the shock of November 2016, plenty of Americans declared Trump \u201cnot my president\u201d. That is a dangerous move, and mirrors Republicans who already in the 1990s referred to Bill Clinton as \u201cyour president\u201d, denying the legitimacy of their political adversaries. Trump, alas, <em>is</em> our president \u2013 he\u2019s just not acting like it.</p> <p>Democrats may worry that assertively providing alternative leadership is seen as \u201cdivisive\u201d or as \u201cpoliticizing\u201d the crisis. But like it or not, we are already in the campaign; Trump is being as divisive as ever; and, most important, an opposition ready to provide comprehensive alternatives is the heart of representative democracy. This is more obvious in parliamentary systems; think of how the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons is supposed to rise immediately after the prime minister and start rebutting.</p> <p>Some commentators have suggested Joe Biden put together a <a href=\"https://saraacarter.com/msnbc-host-suggests-biden-form-a-shadow-government-to-counter-trumps-covid-response/\">\u201cshadow cabinet\u201d</a>, following the UK example.

fans download an app and \u201cself-isolate\u201d for 14 days if they want to go to the State of Origin. </p> \n  <p><strong>Peter V\u2019landys</strong> made the comments to Triple M radio this morning, saying he was looking at ways to hold the event with a safer or smaller crowd. </p> \n  <p>The ARLC has already announced that a three-game Origin series will be held at the end of the year, but the exact details are yet to be determined. </p> \n  <p>Today V\u2019landys floated a number of possibilities, including holding the games in a way that \u201crewards health workers\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe may not have the crowds of a normal State of Origin, but a limited crowd with social distancing, and there\u2019s a few ideas we have in rewarding the emergency workers,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another one where we put people on an app and if you\u2019re a really hardcore supporter and you can stay at home for 14 days and isolate yourself and we track you on the app, you can go to the game.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a few things we can do in that period of time.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated

The global African diaspora has put pressure on African embassies and institutions to act. Last weekend the Kenyan government announced plans to allow its citizens stranded in China to be evacuated.</p> <p>The official Chinese responses were at first silence or denial. State media such as Global Times and Xinhua failed to report the story in the first few days after the news broke in African news outlets. Later, the Chinese authorities began to recognise the reports of racism as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/chinese-official-claims-racial-targeting-reasonable-concerns\">reasonable concerns</a>\u201d, though migrants continue to feel unsafe.</p> <p>To outsiders, this horrendous racism may appear \u201cunprecedented\u201d. But ethnic minorities in China would find it all too familiar. In Shaoguan, not far from Guangzhou, the racist murder of two Uighur workers in 2009 triggered a series of events, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_riots\">\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Inciden</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_\u00dcr\u00fcmqi_riots\">t</a>, which led to further repression in the north-western region of Xinjiang.</p> <p>The ideology of \u201crace\u201d in China goes back a long way. In the late 19th century, Qing imperial reformers searched for an \u201canswer\u201d that could revive China in face of European and Japanese colonialist expansion. \u201cRace\u201d, \u201cnation\u201d and nationalism have since been embedded into Chinese republicanism in the early 20th century, and then into the establishment of the Chinese Communist party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dannydvincent/status/1251810427123580928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My report on allegations of &#39;arbitrary detention&#39; of Africans in the Chinese city of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Guangzhou?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Guangzhou</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorld?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bbcworld</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCAfrica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BBCAfrica</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/63lODEuBIF\">pic.twitter.com/63lODEuBIF</a></p>&mdash; Danny Vincent (@dannydvincent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannydvincent/status/1251810427123580928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 19, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Nationalism has taken deeper root in the four decades since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/18/globaleconomy-economics\">Deng Xiaoping\u2019s</a> economic reforms. National revival has been a key ideological driver behind modernisation. </p> <p>Today, assimilationism is at the centre of the concept of nation. <em>Minzu</em>, a key term used interchangeably for both ethnic group and nationality, refers to a group of common descent, with a distinct culture and territory.</p> <p>In 2012, Xi Jinping began his rule by saying: \u201cThe China dream gathers Chinese aspirations and wishes for generations and manifests the interests of the whole Chinese nation (<em>zhonghua minzu</em>) \u2026\u201d The \u201cChina dream\u201d became the political-economic programme for \u201cthe realisation of the great revival of the Chinese nation\u201d.</p> <p>This century is the \u201cChinese century\u201d, Xi said. His multibillion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">Belt and Road Initiative</a> was launched in 2013 as a massive global investment programme.

China now holds <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2018/04/16/competing-in-africa-china-the-european-union-and-the-united-states/\">14% of the total debt stock</a> in sub-Saharan Africa and has become the largest owner of public debt in Africa.</p> <p>China\u2019s growing presence brought with it labour migration from African countries from the late 1990s. People from Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana and other west African countries came for work opportunities, mostly in the metropolis of Guangzhou. Many work in the city\u2019s wholesale markets as other types of employment, including factory work, are closed to them. It\u2019s commonly said by them that Africans are often \u201caccepted as traders but discriminated against as people\u201d. There are currently more than 15,000 African migrants with formal immigration status living in Guangzhou.</p> <p>Although China has the lowest immigration in the world (migrants account for just <a href=\"https://qz.com/1163632/china-still-has-the-smallest-share-of-incoming-migrants-in-the-world/\">0.07% of the population</a>), the authorities impose harsh \u201cmigrant management\u201d. African migrants can often be criminalised in a similar way to the internal migrants from the countryside. Apart from immigration checks and crackdowns, the authorities consistently discourage migrants from living in certain neighbourhoods. There is no legal protection against racial discrimination.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted this longstanding anti-African racism. With all the damage this pandemic has done to the economy and people\u2019s livelihoods, scapegoating and hostility towards an imagined outside threat clearly helps to divert domestic frustration away from the ruling elite \u2013 a trend we are all seeing worldwide.

  "<p>Every technological innovation both changes its human users and uncovers something new about our nature. In this ingenious novel, Argentinian author Samanta Schweblin conducts an unnerving thought experiment: if an individual could be virtually inserted into the life of a random stranger, anywhere in the world, what effects would that have on them both? And what hidden truths would be revealed?</p> <p><em>Little Eyes</em> follows her gripping 2017 novella <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/fever-dream-by-samanta-schweblin-review\">Fever Dream</a></em>, a destabilising parable about GM farming and maternal anxiety, and a story collection of domestic surrealism, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/09/mouthful-of-birds-by-samanta-schweblin-review\">Mouthful of Birds</a></em>; all three books have been long- or shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/man-booker-international-prize\">International Booker</a>. In her new novel the gadget that\u2019s sweeping the globe is called a kentuki. It\u2019s not much more, says one character, than \u201ca cell phone with legs\u201d, but the camera and speaker are housed within the felt-covered, remotely propelled body of a toy animal \u2013 rabbit or panda, dragon or crow, the buyer or \u201ckeeper\u201d decides. What the keeper can\u2019t choose is who the \u201cdweller\u201d connecting with the robot and watching online is, while dwellers have no control over where, and with whom, they \u201cwake up\u201d. As with a human life, the stakes are high; there is one connection per kentuki, one mind per body. When the keeper destroys their pet or forgets to charge its batteries, or the dweller disconnects, it\u2019s game over, no replays. If death is what gives life reality, the life of a kentuki is real.</p> <p>Schweblin familiarises the reader by artful degrees, introducing us to dwellers and keepers around the world, all reacting differently to the new gizmos. For Emilia in Peru, globalisation has meant profound loss; her grown-up son has been \u201csnatched away\u201d to Hong Kong for a glittering career. When he gives her a connection, she turns on her computer and wakes up in a flat in Germany, where she enjoys being a pet bunny for a young woman: attention at last, and day-to-day intimacy. In Mexico, purposeless Alina finds herself choosing between a crow and a dragon for \u201cthe miraculous distraction\u201d of unboxing a new product. In Antigua, a stifled little boy called Marvin who is grieving for his mother wakes up at the top of the globe and goes looking for snow: \u201cAt least in this other life, he wouldn\u2019t let himself be locked up.\u201d Italian Enzo falls into easy companionship with the mole that follows him around his greenhouse. And the consequences of capitalism never stop evolving: in Zagreb Grigor starts a business buying and tending connections through multiple tablets, so he can offer tailor-made experiences to those who want more consumer choice than the market officially offers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alina wants to keep her crow as a toy, but gradually it becomes the conduit and eventually target for her rage and shame</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has always been a tinge of horror to Schweblin\u2019s work, and here she gets full effect from violent interludes where the connections go sour. That hoary staple of an inanimate object coming alive can be just as frightening when you\u2019ve paid for it to happen \u2013 even, or perhaps especially, when it\u2019s a cuddly panda rolling closer with unknown intent. But as she works through the implications of her premise in a nimble, fast-moving narrative, what\u2019s most impressive is the way she foregrounds her characters\u2019 inner hopes and fears.</p> <p>The kentuki can hear and translate speech, but only respond with animal-appropriate squeaks or purrs, so the first issue is always communication: whether dweller and keeper will connect in the wider world. For Alina, the relationship is about control. She wants to keep her crow as nothing more than a toy, but gradually it becomes the conduit and eventually target for her rage and shame. Marvin finds he has more power and agency when negotiating the world as a kentuki: \u201cMarvin was no longer a boy with a dragon; he was a dragon with a boy inside him.\u201d When the characters happen by chance to glimpse their kentuki selves, they feel an overwhelming tenderness for the ball of plastic and felt that is the vessel for their consciousness. In a disassociated world, they are seeing themselves at last.</p> <p>Like Mohsin Hamid\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/02/exit-west-mohsin-hamid-review-andrew-motion-migrants\">Exit West</a>, in which magical doors act as portals out of conflict zones, <em>Little Eyes</em> has much to say about connection and empathy in a globalised world. On a personal level, its investigation into solitude and online experience becomes only more poignant in a global lockdown. Marvin has never seen snow; he longs to roll his little dragon into an untouched snowbank, to leave his mark. It would be \u201cjust like touching the other end of the world with your own fingertips\u201d. If a virtual reality is all we can have, we will still reach out to explore its limits.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Little Eyes by Samanta Schweblin, translated by Megan McDowell, is published by Oneworld (RRP \u00a314.99).

  "<p>\ufeffFrom the moment in 1976 that Serbian and German performance artists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\">Marina Abramovi\u0107 </a>and Ulay (Frank Uwe Laysiepen, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/02/a-pioneer-and-provocateur-performance-artist-ulay-dies-aged-76\">died last month</a> aged 76) clapped eyes on each other they were inseparable. Ulay found Abramovi\u0107 witchy and otherworldly; she found him wild and exciting. Even their initial encounter was propitious: they met in Amsterdam on their shared birthday of 30 November.</p> <p>The pair began to perform together, describing themselves as a \u201ctwo-headed body\u201d. For years they lived a nomadic lifestyle, travelling across Europe in a corrugated iron van and performing in villages and towns. Their artistic collaborations matched their personalities: they focused on performances that put them in precarious and physically demanding situations, to see how they and their audience would respond. In one, called Relation in Time, they remained tied together by their hair for 17 hours. They explored conflict, taking their ideas to extremes: running full pelt into each other, naked, and slapping each other\u2019s faces until they could take no more.</p> <p>One of their pieces, Rest Energy, performed in Dublin in 1980, saw them balance each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107\u2019s heart; one slip from Ulay and he could have killed her. Uncomfortable viewing, this was relationship therapy played out as art \u2013 and, perhaps, vice versa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa186172e57b5024f4b37a70b619f6878ce293f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa186172e57b5024f4b37a70b619f6878ce293f4/0_164_5328_3197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marina and Ulay perform Rest Energy in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marina and Ulay perform Rest Energy in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gryf/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1983, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay announced their ultimate collaboration: The Lovers. They proposed to be the first people to walk the Great Wall of China. Setting off alone from opposite ends, they planned to meet in the middle, where they would marry. Exhilarated by the emotional and physical scale of The Lovers, the pair imagined themselves walking alone across great expanses of the Chinese landscape, camping under the stars and concluding the journey with the ultimate commitment. They saw The Lovers as an odyssey and a performance in which they alone would be both players and audience.</p> <p>Eager to prepare, and ever-practical, Ulay laid in a year\u2019s supply of dried tofu and seaweed, together with tents and camping stoves. What the pair were less prepared for, however, was Chinese bureaucracy. The Beijing authorities struggled to comprehend the pair\u2019s motives for the journey. No one camped or walked the Great Wall as an \u201cart project\u201d. And who in their right minds would want to get married on it? Paper trails were endless. Permissions and visas were granted then denied. The pair were told that it would be too dangerous to do the walk alone and they would be required to have an accompanying crew. As phone calls, letters and documents were fired back and forth between China and the artists, years rolled by.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9fa58bedea93bf58eb5a10df6441888e7cfd9d49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fa58bedea93bf58eb5a10df6441888e7cfd9d49/130_0_3732_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of the Great Wall of China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of the Great Wall.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Real444/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1986, they went to China to visit parts of the Great Wall, to familiarise themselves with it and meet some of the villagers they would be staying with. Permission was finally granted for the walk to take place the following year. Then, inexplicably, the authorities postponed it again. A frustrated Ulay confessed: \u201cI have been living with the wall in my thoughts for five years. Already I feel I have walked it 10 times. Already it is worn, it is polished.\u201d </p> <p>Finally, having also agreed to participate in a film of their \u201cstudy\u201d of The Great Wall for Chinese Central Television, they were granted permission.</p> <p>Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their walks on 30 March 1988, from either end of the Great Wall, known to the Chinese as The Sleeping Dragon. Abramovi\u0107, set off westwards from the dragon\u2019s head at the Bohai Sea, an extension of the Yellow Sea between China and the Korean peninsula. Dressed in baggy red clothes, she was given the nickname Pa Ma Ta Je \u2013 big fat sister mother.</p> <p>Much of her trek proved arduous. Abramovi\u0107 was walking through the mountainous regions of eastern China. On such difficult and inaccessible terrain, she had to watch every step. On her fourth day, after slipping on rocks as slippery as polished ice, Abramovi\u0107 and her guide found themselves hanging by their fingertips over an abyss. She found homes and stables built into sections of the winding wall, and other parts that had been dismantled by locals who, under Mao\u2019s encouragement to \u201ckill the dragon\u201d, had removed the clay and stones to build with. Once, Abramovi\u0107 claimed to have walked through a kilometre of human bones. Her accommodation in villages and hostels each night was often a two-hour trek from the wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f4e906721f95a251ad568abfbe9e763e11b22f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f4e906721f95a251ad568abfbe9e763e11b22f1/0_49_1188_713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marina Abramovic on the wall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marina Abramovi\u0107 found much of the walk arduous.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: publicdelivery.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At every village she stayed in, Abramovi\u0107 asked to meet its oldest resident and for them to share a local legend. Inevitably these were dragon stories, often related to the wall itself. While built more than a 1,000 years as a defence against invaders from the north and west, the serpentine spine of the Great Wall had been carefully mapped out by geomancers for its \u201cdragon energy\u201d. Abramovi\u0107 would occasionally find copper pots placed along the wall, as energy spots: acupuncture points to control the forces that rippled up and down the creature\u2019s back.</p> <p>Five thousand kilometres west of Abramovi\u0107, Ulay had started his walk at the dragon\u2019s tail in the Gobi Desert. Moustachioed and lean, with long hair and matching bright-blue drawstring trousers and cape, Ulay would have looked to a westerner every bit the bohemian traveller. Most of his journey would be spent trekking through China\u2019s deserts. Rickshaws and donkeys were familiar sights, as were camels pulling ploughs. Ulay crossed the great Yellow River on a raft covered with sheepskins and, like Abramovi\u0107, saw families living in caves within the wall itself. He managed to sleep under the stars some nights, while his bemused crew watched over him from their jeeps. Most of the time, however, Ulay also had to sleep in nearby villages. While the simplicity of the trek stirred Ulay\u2019s soul, its fragmentation by bureaucracy and restrictions meant it was not the romantic sojourn the pair had dreamed of.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc4407d3b37bd577d7ecc4d6a83b16ec6949f23a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4407d3b37bd577d7ecc4d6a83b16ec6949f23a/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Wall of China is a collective name for fortifications that started being built in the seventh century BC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great Wall of China is a collective name for fortifications that started being built in the seventh century BC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zhaojiankang/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the Chinese who encountered the artists, they were of great curiosity. Having originally believed themselves to be the sole players and audience for their walk, they found everything they did was witnessed as if a performance. In towns and villages, silent crowds followed them wherever they went. In one settlement, villagers gathered to watch Abramovi\u0107 sleep. When she awoke, a different group were present, silently observing her.</p> <p>More by happenstance than planning, Ulay and Abramovi\u0107 met at the centre of a stone bridge in Shenmu in Shaanxi province, among a series of temples built in the Ming dynasty. They had averaged 20km a day, walked 90 days and covered roughly 2,000km each. As they embraced affectionately, Ulay shared with Abramovi\u0107 his desire to continue the walk \u201cforever\u201d. Abramovi\u0107 was unequivocal in her desire to get home. Ulay made a comment about her shoes that seemed to annoy her; to his irritation she began to cry.</p> <p>While musicians, the Chinese press and even a fireworks display had been laid on for the pair, there would be no wedding ceremony. After a press conference in Beijing, they returned separately to Amsterdam and didn\u2019t speak or see one another for 22 years. What had gone wrong?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"605b9277eb9e6afdd1e984682e3116eff92f2b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/605b9277eb9e6afdd1e984682e3116eff92f2b67/63_80_1411_847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ulay and Marina approach each other at the end of their trek.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ulay and Marina approach each other at the end of their trek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: publicdelivery.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the five years that Ulay and Abramovi\u0107 had been waiting for permission for the walk, their lives had changed irrevocably. Their work had became internationally renowned. Abramovi\u0107 was fed up with being the archetypal poor artist, so she welcomed the success, but Ulay had no interest in celebrity. An anarchist who enjoyed solitude, he rebelled against what he saw as a growing commercialisation of their work. In short, they had grown apart. Both had had affairs; communication and trust had broken down.</p> <p>Ulay and Abramovi\u0107 were not, however, the kind of couple to be easily defeated. They decided to go ahead with the walk, not in order to marry but to spilt up. The Lovers transformed from wedding to divorce. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just make a phone call and break up like normal people?\u201d one friend allegedly quipped. Because that simply wasn\u2019t their style.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d94c3ef9fd6b3b4bdac34bd007aa7aae841d12d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d94c3ef9fd6b3b4bdac34bd007aa7aae841d12d3/0_0_602_361/500.jpg\" alt=\"Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay, shortly after meeting on the wall.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marina and Ulay finally meet on the wall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: publicdelivery.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the Chinese, the dragon is an auspicious symbol, representing strength, good fortune and the elemental forces of nature. Walking the dragon\u2019s spine had, for Ulay and Abramovi\u0107, been intended as a great motif for transcending the barriers that divide us \u2013 it was to be a totem of love and reconnection. Instead, the wall came to represent a division in myriad forms, not just physical but also the political barriers they then perceived between east and west, as well as the emotional barriers that had grown between the pair. Since planning to walk the wall, their differences had become more apparent and more difficult to reconcile. Abramovi\u0107 embraced the growing success of their work; Ulay withdrew from it.</p> <p>Unlike in China, the dragon in western mythology is perceived as a symbol of malevolence, a destructive creature to be hunted down and destroyed. Abramovi\u0107 claimed that the idea for The Lovers came to her in a dream, a vision in which the pair would wake a sleeping dragon through their epic walk. They had, it seemed, woken the wrong dragon.</p> <p>Over the next two decades, Abramovi\u0107\u2019s work continued to reach larger and larger audiences; her celebrity grew. Her work inspired Lady Gaga and Jay-Z, she made adverts for Adidas and she came to be known as \u201cthe grandmother of performance art\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e944d5cd38da8aba296ec1913f494f5212dcad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e944d5cd38da8aba296ec1913f494f5212dcad/623_316_2977_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ulay and Marina sit opposite each other in 2010\u2019s The Artist is Present.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ulay and Marina sit opposite each other in 2010\u2019s The Artist is Present.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick McMullan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2010, at a New York Museum of Modern Art retrospective of her work entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/marina-abramovic-artist-present-review\">The Artist Is Present</a>, Abramovi\u0107 sat for eight hours a day \u2013 750 hours in total \u2013 in silence, at a table. Members of the public were invited to come, sit and hold her gaze. They were kept two metres apart at opposite ends of a table. Contact was not permitted. The show was spiritual and cathartic for some, pretentious and self-indulgent to others. Many queued for hours for the opportunity to sit opposite Abramovi\u0107 for a few minutes or, in a few cases \u2013 and to the irritation of those in the queue \u2013 the whole day.</p> <p>One moment, however, was to capture the world\u2019s attention and amass close to 20 million views on YouTube.

He nervously stretches his legs, adjusts his jacket and, as Abramovi\u0107 opens her eyes to see him, the pair smile. It is the first time in 22 years that they have seen each other. Tears fill their eyes.</p> <p>Finally Abramovi\u0107, in a flowing blood-red dress, leans across the two-metre division and \u2013 breaking her own rule of non-contact \u2013 takes Ulay\u2019s hands. Onlookers begin to applaud. It is impossible to watch this moment without also being moved to tears. After their arduous journey and a long time apart, they are finally reunited. A new dragon is awakened. Intimacy is rekindled.</p> <p>While their separation was a choice, ours \u2013 for now \u2013 remains a necessity. In time, physical intimacy will return to us all. And with it, perhaps, the opportunity for us all to awaken a new dragon.</p>",
  "<p>After giving Carson Wentz a playmaker, the Philadelphia Eagles drafted his backup.</p> <p>The Eagles selected Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts in the second round of the NFL draft on Friday night, a stunning move for a team with more pressing needs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/24/nfl-virtual-draft-television-abc-espn\">The NFL's virtual draft was dry, boring and everything we needed right now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Philadelphia hoped it filled a big void in the first round, taking TCU wide receiver Jalen Reagor with the 21st overall pick. But the team passed on other receivers and defensive players to add Hurts at No 53.</p> <p>\u201cQuarterback is the most important position in sports,\u201d Eagles executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman said. \u201cWe have shown how we feel about Carson by our actions, by the amount of picks we put into him, and we showed it by the contract extension. We believe this is the guy to lead us to our next Super Bowl championship. But for better or worse, we are quarterback developers. We want to be a quarterback factory.\u201d</p> <p>Hurts transferred from Alabama to Oklahoma and became a Heisman Trophy finalist last year when he threw for 3,851 yards and 32 touchdowns.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity to go there, be part of the organization, it\u2019s surreal,\u201d Hurts said about playing in Philadelphia. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to grow, learn and be best quarterback I can be. I\u2019m ready to go to work. I\u2019ve always been about the grind.\u201d</p> <p>Hurts will provide insurance for Wentz, who started 16 games last season and led the Eagles to the NFC East title but was knocked out of a wild-card playoff loss to Seattle with a concussion.</p> <p>Wentz, the No 2 overall pick in 2016, helped Philadelphia secure the NFC\u2019s No 1 seed in his sophomore season but tore two knee ligaments and watched Nick Foles lead the Eagles to the franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl title. Wentz injured his back in 2018 and Foles stepped in again and led the team to a playoff win.</p> <p>Roseman said he spoke with Wentz about picking Hurts earlier in the day. Wentz, who finished third in NFL MVP voting in 2017, signed a $137m contract extension last season.</p> <p>\u201cWe think Carson is a phenomenal player and nobody is going to be looking at a rookie quarterback taking over for a Pro Bowl quarterback who was on the cusp of being an MVP,\u201d Roseman said.</p> <p>Hurts, 6ft 1in and 218lbs, led two elite programs to the College Football Playoffs and put up big numbers both passing and rushing. His passing accuracy and consistency were the biggest questions entering the draft.</p> <p>Hurts went was 38-4 as a starter, including 26-2 for the Crimson Tide and was the Southeastern Conference player of the year as a freshman. Then he was benched at halftime of the national championship game against Georgia, with Tua Tagovailoa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/09/alabama-georgia-comeback-national-championship\">leading the comeback victory</a> and ultimately winning the starting job for the 2018 season.</p> <h2>Round two heavy on receivers</h2> <p>While only one quarterback, Hurts, was taken in the second round of the NFL draft Friday, the guys who haul in passes were everywhere.</p> <p>Starting with the top two selections on day two \u2013 Clemson\u2019s Tee Higgins to Cincinnati and Southern California\u2019s Michael Pittman to Indianapolis \u2013 seven wideouts were drafted. Add that to the six who went in the opening session, and it set an NFL record through two rounds.</p> <p>The NFL these days is built on passing offenses. This draft is loaded with outstanding pass catchers. Many teams had both Higgins and Pittman rated as top-32 talent.</p> <p>So the Cincinnati Bengals held firm atop the second round by grabbing Higgins to catch Joe Burrow\u2019s passes. The pair worked out together heading toward the draft.</p> <p>And Higgins idolizes Bengals star receiver AJ Green.</p> <p>\u201cI actually model my game after him,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cMan, it\u2019s crazy. I was just talking about this to my good friend \u2013 I could end up with the Bengals and be his teammate one day. Now that this moment is here, it\u2019s surreal.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to finding what they hope will be their franchise quarterback in LSU\u2019s Burrow with the first overall pick, the Bengals (2-14 last season) added a threat who can make the spectacular reception.</p> <p>Pittman takes his 6ft 4in, 224lb frame to Indianapolis. The Colts had no first-rounder, and they quickly gave new quarterback Philip Rivers a target in Pittman, whose father also played in the NFL.</p> <p>\u201cI think they brought me in to make an impact right now and they have Philip Rivers, who I think is a Hall of Famer,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cI\u2019m happy I get to start with like a Hall of Fame quarterback.\u201d</p> <p>Two positions barely or not addressed at all in the first round got some attention directly after Higgins and Pittman were selected. Georgia\u2019s D\u2019Andre Swift became the second running back chosen, by Detroit. LSU\u2019s Clyde Edwards-Helaire was the only RB who went in the opening round, last to Super Bowl champions Kansas City.</p> <p>Swift is a dynamic playmaker unlike anyone the Lions have had in the backfield in years \u2013 maybe since Hall of Famer Barry Sanders, who retired in 1998.</p> <p>Four more running backs went in the round.</p> <p>Safety was ignored on Thursday, but immediately was addressed by the Giants in round two with Alabama\u2019s Xavier McKinney. New York\u2019s secondary has been a sieve.</p> <p>\u201cHe also has that ability to be a quarterback on the back end, a signal caller for the defense,\u201d coach Joe Judge said. \u201cHe fits the mold of a smart, tough, fundamentally sound guy we are looking to build with.\u201d</p> <p>New England finally surfaced with the 37th overall spot after trading out of the first round. Coach Bill Belichick was nowhere in sight \u2013 his dog appeared to be manning his laptop \u2013 as the Patriots chose Kyle Dugger, a safety from Division II Lenoir-Rhyne. Dugger not only was the first player not in FBS to be selected, but only the second from a non-Power Five conference. Utah State quarterback Jordan Love, who went 26th overall to Green Bay, was the other.</p> <p>After a record 15 of the 32 players in the first round came from the Southeastern Conference, another 10 SEC players came off the board in Round 2. And that\u2019s not including Hurts, who transferred to the Big 12 for his final season.</p> <p>Other teams making their initial selections Friday night saw:</p> <ul> <li><p>TCU defensive tackle Ross Blacklock going to Houston</p></li> <li><p>Chicago adding a 10th tight end to its roster in Cole Kmet of Notre Dame</p></li> <li><p>Another Irish player, wideout Chase Claypool, a Canadian, to Pittsburgh</p></li> <li><p>Florida State\u2019s Cam Akers to the Rams, who had released their standout running back, Todd Gurley last month, with Gurley surfacing in Atlanta</p></li> <li><p>Buffalo adding to an already solid defense with Iowa end AJ Epenesa, one of the Big Ten\u2019s outstanding defenders</p></li> </ul> <h2>Second-round picks</h2> <p>33.

Capacity for performing wellness checks on vulnerable residents will also be expanded. </p> \n  <p>Local agencies will begin distributing criteria on who qualifies for the program, but of highest priority are seniors who live below the poverty line and those with compromised immune systems. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThese programs will provide older, vulnerable Californians with access to nutritious meals in the safety of their homes and the opportunity to connect with someone who can listen to their concerns and make sure their needs are met. We are all in this together and we will continue to support older Californians who are more at risk during this public health emergency\u201d Newsom said in a press release.</p> \n  <p>The program, funded by the state and by <strong>FEMA</strong>, will provide three meals a day, seven days a week, with a daily cash value of up to $66. Newsom said the program could also mean relief for the restaurant industry and its workers. State and local governments will select which restaurants will be included in the program. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis will allow for restaurants to start rehiring people or keep people employed\u201d, he said. </p> \n  <p>Meantime, with warm weather expected in California over the weekend, Newsom reminded Californians that it\u2019s not yet time to greenlight the reopening of wide sections of society. </p> \n  <p>Yesterday California tallied 93 deaths, and the number of confirmed coronavirus cases ticked up 5% in the past 24 hours. Hospitalizations and admissions to ICUs, on the other hand, stayed largely flat. </p> \n  <p>California is a state but many parts, Newsom said, and the state will consider regional realities \u2014 like the number of cases and hospital capacity should outbreaks resurface \u2014 when deciding to ease stay-at-home orders. </p> \n  <p>In recent days, protestors have challenged stay-at-home orders in various states, including California.

So, the vision is already in place. </p> \n  <p>This is why the ban, with its exceptions, was interpreted as a largely political move.

Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest u-turn. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A video of the briefings demonstrates otherwise. </p> \n  <p>When Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of <strong>Bill Bryan</strong>, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and <strong>Deborah Birx</strong>, the coronavirus task force coordinator.</p> \n  <p><strong>Reuters</strong> reporter <strong>Jeff Mason</strong> asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him. </p> \n  <p>He replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But returning to the effect of sunlight, he added: \u201cI\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. But maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.\u201d</p> \n  <p>One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason answered: \u201cSome doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump said: \u201cOf course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason shot back: \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t, sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Weijia Jiang</strong> of <strong>CBS News </strong>pointed out that Trump had been looking at Birx. Changing his story, Trump claimed: \u201cI was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there? </p> \n  <p>Jiang said: \u201cI was there and I watched you ask her.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump, who has clashed with Jiang in the briefing room, added: \u201cYou were there. You were there. You I never forget.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The jumbled, inaccurate assertions are likely to have the opposite of the desired effect, only deepening concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Gottlieb</strong>, Trump\u2019s former <strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> director, told <strong>CNBC</strong>: </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no circumstance in which that\u2019s appropriate, and it can cause death and very adverse outcomes, so people should not be doing that if that was an impression that was left by any of the reporting around comments that have been made in the last 24 hours.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea33b128f08e05690dc4319\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T19:19:03.758Z\">8.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Navy leader recommends reinstating fired captain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Officials with the US Navy recommended the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.</p> \n  <p>Roosevelt was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard.

Now disinfectant or doing this maybe on the hands would work. I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday, Bill [Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology], because when they say that something will last three to four hours or six hours, but if sun is out, or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: When I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.</p> \n  <p> Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: To look into whether or not sun \u2014 and disinfectant on the hands \u2014 but whether or not sun can help us. Because, I mean he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact negatively on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought up, and I thought that was clear.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason [Reuters journalist]: Just to follow up on the comments from yesterday you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify?</p> \n  <p>POTUS: I wish they [\u2026]</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Do you want to clarify to Americans if you don\u2019t want people to think that?</p> \n  <p>POTUS. Yes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do. So, he\u2019s going to check because a hard surface. This is a hard surface I guess maybe depending on whose hand you\u2019re talking about, right? But this is a hard surface and disinfectant, disinfectant has an unbelievable \u2014 it wipes it out. You saw it? Sun and heat, and humidity and you wipe it out. And this is from tests \u2014 they\u2019ve been doing these tests for a number of months. And the result \u2014 so then I said, \u2018Well, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfectant I think would work.\u2019 He thinks it would work. When you use it when you\u2019re doing your hands. I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons they say wash your hands, but whether it\u2019s washing hands or disinfectant on your hands, it\u2019s very good. So, they\u2019re going to start looking at that. And there is a way of, you know, if light \u2014 if sun, sun itself that sun has a tremendous impact on or kills it like in one \u2014 it goes from what was it? Hours to like one minute instead.</p> \n  <p>So, I said you got to go back and look, but I\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. but maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Just to clarify: You\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: No. Of course not\u2026It was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinary hostile people. Namely, the fake news media.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Some doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: Of course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason: No you weren\u2019t sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: What\u2019s that?</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: I was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there.

Officials had insisted until recent days that travel restrictions would remain for the foreseeable future, with the country\u2019s president, Milos Zeman, suggesting last weekend that frontiers should stay closed for the next year.</p> \n  <p>However, Vojt\u011bch heralded a dramatic reversal in a late-night press conference on Thursday but indicated the onus would be on travellers to prove they were uninfected on their return.</p> \n  <p>\u201cUpon return, travellers will either have to present confirmation of a negative test for coronavirus, or be forced to spend 14 days in quarantine,\u201d he said. Commuters would also be able to cross the borders daily if they presented a negative test for coronavirus every 14 days, Vojt\u011bch added, a move that will affect a relatively small number of people who live in the Czech Republic but work in a neighbouring country, or vice versa.</p> \n  <p>In a further development, the deputy health minister, Roman Prymula, announced that mandatory face mask-wearing \u2013 credited by officials with containing the virus\u2019s spread \u2013 would stay until at least the end of June. Restrictions are also being lifted on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 people now permitted to gather. Previous rules limited outdoor gatherings to two.</p> \n  <p>The move follows growing public pressure for an easing of emergency measures. But there was criticism that the announcement sowed confusion, with no immediate announcement on when foreign visitors would be allowed to re-enter, which would help Prague\u2019s beleaguered tourist economy.</p> \n  <p>The announcement came hours after the government had accelerated its timetable for reopening the economy following pressure from Czech trading lobbies. Restaurants and pubs will be allowed to fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned in a five-phase restart plan announced last week. Zoos will be allowed to reopen from Monday, a month earlier than planned.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The relaxations came after Prague\u2019s municipal court on Thursday ruled the government\u2019s restrictions unlawful.</p> \n  <p>Officials have hailed better-than-expected results from the anti-coronavirus clampdown.

Currently there are typically more than 2,000 new infections every day.</p> \n  <p>According to the RKI, Germany has 150,383 confirmed cases, a rise of 2,337 from Thursday, and 5,321 people have died from the virus. </p> \n  <p>But due to a delay in the central collation of figures, the real number of cases is said by reliable health watchers gathering statistics on the L\u00e4nder level, to be more than 3,000 higher, and the number of deaths just under 300 more than the RKI\u2019s figures.</p> \n  <p>The current reproduction rate in Germany is 0.9 - which means every person with the infection is passing it on to one other person. This is up from 0.7 a week ago, but virologists consider one and under to be good.</p> \n  <p>Schaade said keeping the restrictions was necessary because in order to be able to keep the disease under control, health authorities around the country have to be in a position to be able to identify each case and trace their contacts, to place them in immediate isolation. If the number of new infections grows too quickly, the tracking and tracing process becomes too unwieldy a task, and the situation could quickly get out of control, he said.</p> \n  <p>He said unlike in Italy, France and Spain, there was so far no evidence of excess mortality in Germany - that is, a death rate higher than the usual average death rate for this time of year. This was, he said, due to the fact that Germany was able to tackle the illness early on, largely through testing, and dampen its spread, and therefore treated many coronavirus cases effectively, without lessening hospitals\u2019 ability to treat other illnesses.</p> \n  <p>Referring to the pressure being placed on authorities to relax measures, which he advised against strongly, Schaade said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a paradox, that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very measures are now being called into question.</p> \n   <p>That Germany has come through this epidemic comparatively well so far, is thanks to the measures we have taken. The number of cases has stayed at a level with which the health system has been able to cope, and it must stay that way. We cannot afford to become lax. With respect to the first relaxation of measures, this must not be allowed to lead to a landslide of other subsequent easing that could have serious consequences.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said quite simply, that more contact would automatically lead to more infections \u201cand when there are more infections a dynamic will develop again very quickly with rising infection rates which in the worst case, could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable.</p> \n  <p>In short, Schaade said, his \u201cemphatic plea\u201d was for people to stick to the recommendations: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Stay at home, stay away from others, keep the 1.5 metre - or even better 2 metre distance, keep to the coughing and sneezing rules, and on public transport or shops, wear mouth-nose cover to protect others.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He recognised, he said, that \u201cmany people are running out of strength, and many are suffering from existential angst. Believe me, I\u2019d like nothing more than to tell you it\u2019s over...but unfortunately it\u2019s not over.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2da8a8f08e05690dc3da5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:34:50.853Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While social distancing and national lockdowns have been credited with slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, governments and experts have said the only permanent way out is through a <strong tabindex=\"-1\">vaccine</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Vaccine development usually takes years, meaning that teams around the world are considering a range of risks and shortcuts to bring one to market in a much shorter time. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Hannah Devlin</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, has looked at four different approaches being taken by research teams around the world, ranging from classic weakened viruses, to genetically modified forms, to revolutionary approaches using DNA and RNA. </p> \n  <p>But, as she writes, there is a chance none of them will work, or that they may have serious unintended side-effects. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 a perilous and uncertain path</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:40:12.444Z\">at 1.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2d58b8f08fa2bdcb1aaf1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:05:57.027Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italy \"to ease lockdown\", local media reports</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks.

It has asked its citizens to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill - but there has been no enforced lockdown.</p> \n  <p>The country has seen a higher death rate than its neighbours. Yesterday, the Public Health Agency of Sweden said it had recorded 16,755 confirmed cases, and 2,021 deaths with the coronavirus. And there has been anger in the country that older people have borne the brunt of the strategy, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">as reported by my colleague Richard Orange</a>. </p> \n  <p>Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus policy, told the Observer<em>. </em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They have to admit that it\u2019s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Tegnall today said Sweden\u2019s strategy put it in a better place to deal with a second wave of coronavirus as the country\u2019s scientists estimated there was now around 15-20% immunity in the population \u2013 not enough for herd immunity, but enough to slow and control the spread of the disease. </p> \n  <p>Asked if the policy had worked, Tegnall said the aim had been to slow the progression of the disease so its healthcare system did not become overwhelmed. </p> \n  <p>It has worked in some aspects. The health service has been able to cope \u2013 20% of ICU beds have been empty and able to take coronavirus patients at all times. </p> \n  <p>In terms of death toll, Sweden had seen \u201cabout the same results as other countries\u201d, he said. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the fact that there are more deaths in Sweden than in other Scandinavian countries, he said that as many as 50% of deaths had come in care homes for the elderly \u2013 which have banned visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how a lockdown would have stopped that,\u201d he said. Asked if the strategy had resulted in more deaths, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a difficult question and I don\u2019t think we have the answer and I don\u2019t know if we will ever get the answer. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sweden estimates it passed the peak of the disease last week, and hopes it will be better placed to deal with any further outbreaks</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We hope this will make it easier for us in the long run.

As an introvert, I am really looking forward to spending this month focusing inwards, without the burden of social responsibility.</p> \n   <p>Ramadan in 2020 means no communal gatherings in mosques for \u201ctarawih\u201d night prayers, no large \u201ciftar\u201d dinners with family and friends at sunset to break the day\u2019s fast,and, sadly, restrictions on celebrating Eid, the biggest social holiday for Muslims signalling the end of Ramadan.</p> \n   <p>In this time of physical distancing, as Muslims we will be forced to reconnect to our God and the Qur\u2019an on a deeply intimate level. Interestingly enough, this is the authentic practice of Prophet Muhammad. He would isolate himself for days in a cave at the top of a mountain to introspect, reflect, worship and connect with God. During each of the 10 days of Ramadan, he was known to self-isolate in a spiritual seclusion practice known as \u201citik\u0101f\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/ramadan-during-coronavirus-may-seem-disheartening-but-its-the-ideal-time-for-reflection\">Ramadan during coronavirus may seem disheartening but it's the ideal time for reflection | Heba Shaheed</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:55:57.153Z\">at 4.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea25a498f082ab274335cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:22:39.222Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57/0_108_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"About 90 people onboard the cruise ship Costa Atlantica have tested positive for the coronavirus.
