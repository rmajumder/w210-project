That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists?</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">mortality rate</a> is among the 10 highest in the world, at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">240 per million</a> population and steadily rising, and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">nursing homes</a> in Stockholm are now affected.</p> \n   <p>The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-epidemiologist-anders-tegnell-the-target-of-praise-criticism/\">Anders Tegnell</a>, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.</p> \n   <p>But beneath the surface, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden\">Sweden</a> is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of \u201cthe bent twig\u201d, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/01/sweden-coronavirus-strategy-nationalists-britain\">Has Sweden's coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? | Gina Gustavsson</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:32:30.633Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eac0f1a8f0806a479811466\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:05:00.045Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the <strong>UK</strong> because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, <strong>Anna Fazackerly</strong> reports for the Guardian.</p> \n  <p>Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities.

  "<p>With more than \u00a345m in the bank, <strong>1917 </strong>is the year\u2019s highest-grossing film in UK cinemas by a country mile, and as things stand, nothing\u2019s breaking that record for the foreseeable future. If Sam Mendes\u2019s big, punchy first world war epic was still on your to-see list when cinemas succumbed to lockdown in March, its digital release on Monday will come as a welcome quarantine care package.</p> <p>You will have missed an opportunity, though. Justly rewarded at the Oscars for Roger Deakins\u2019s propulsive, sleight-of-hand cinematography and its layered, pummelling sound design, <em>1917</em> remains involving and impressive in any format, but had more immediate sensory grandeur on the big screen. Setting aside the commotion over its smartly executed illusion of being shot in two long takes, Mendes\u2019s film is a man-on-a-mission tale in a simple, even classical vein, thinly characterised in ways that somewhat curtail its emotional impact. The technical showmanship here isn\u2019t mere window-dressing. It\u2019s what makes the film distinguished and immersive in the canon of films about the first world war \u2013 which rarely gets such elaborate cinematic treatment, at least relative to the ongoing parade of pyrotechnically enhanced second world war spectaculars.</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s the knowledge of all that deathly bravado to come, however, that gives an additional sense of piercing tragedy to the greatest first world war films \u2013 many of which are available to stream, if you feel like situating Mendes\u2019s blockbuster in context. Lewis Milestone\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-1930-online\">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></strong> (BFI Player) is, astonishingly, 90 years old this year, and hasn\u2019t dated a whit, neither in its strikingly crisp, clean, unadorned film-making, nor in its tough, unsentimental perspective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64a063d604701d7a5e4fa7ee622381aefcd244a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64a063d604701d7a5e4fa7ee622381aefcd244a0/0_0_2608_1974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All Quiet on the Western Front (1930).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"757\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All Quiet on the Western Front (1930).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It remains pretty much the master template for any anti-war film, its non-partisan depiction of daily life for German soldiers in the trenches as vividly harrowing in its way as Mendes\u2019s missive from the opposite side. That it deservedly won the best picture Oscar in 1930 is all the more remarkable when you consider that the same award went the year before to <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I94VY7W\">Wings</a></strong> (Amazon), a sweeping, silent action romance that seems largely enamoured of its WWI airman derring-do until its slightly ungainly \u201cwar kills\u201d coda. It\u2019s smashing, old-school entertainment, but hasn\u2019t aged nearly as gracefully. See also Howard Hughes\u2019s ludicrously glamorous planes-and-dames spectacle <strong><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/HellsAngels1930JeanHarlow\">Hell\u2019s Angels</a> </strong>(1930), available on the Internet Archive. It\u2019s not much of a history lesson, but it\u2019s a glistening romp.</p> <p>More stately decorum returned in <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07WWJPZTZ\">A Farewell to Arms</a></strong> (Amazon Prime), a handsome, stirring 1932 adaptation of the Hemingway novel that accrues a genuine lump-in-throat gravity to its doomed romance between Gary Cooper\u2019s dashing ambulance officer and Helen Hayes\u2019s Red Cross nurse. Still, Hollywood depictions of the war veered ever more toward grandstanding and patriotism: see Howard Hawks\u2019s flawed but fascinating <strong><a href=\"https://uk.chili.com/movie/sergeant-york-1941/942e7b93-6300-41ec-a90a-46f9afffe29e\">Sergeant York</a></strong> (Chili), a war-hero biopic caught between its subject\u2019s anti-war principles and conservative cheerleading that spoke very much to the moment in 1941. It would take the French to bring some cynicism to proceedings: Jean Renoir\u2019s peerless <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/grand-illusion\">La Grande Illusion</a> </strong>(1937), currently streaming on Mubi, still cuts deep with its humane, complex comedy, astutely threading class solidarity through opposing factions in its prisoner-of-war escape saga.</p> <p>After that, it wasn\u2019t until Stanley Kubrick\u2019s still-breathtaking <strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/paths-of-glory/id280272328?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">Paths of Glory</a></strong> (1957; iTunes) that the Great War got a cast-iron classic film, with a portrayal of trench warfare as unflinching as its thorny examination of the moral consequences.

We cannot depend on a fractured society or a fragmented economy to deliver collective healing and health. Or jobs. Or sustainability. Or social morale.</p> \n<p>We also know that the bushfire crisis, since it is a symptom of the climate emergency, has not gone away. It is, to use the prime minister\u2019s favoured concept, in hibernation.</p> \n<p>The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has recently written:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>... the first priority is to restore our balance: provide more funding for the public sector, especially for those parts of it that are designed to protect against the multitude of risks that a complex society faces, and to fund the advances in science and higher-quality education, on which our future prosperity depends \u2026 Even as we emerge from this crisis, we should be aware that some other crisis surely lurks around the corner. We can\u2019t predict what the next one will look like \u2013 other than it will look different from the last.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Alongside strengthening the social security system and expanding the wage subsidy to include casuals and visa holders the commonwealth government needs to expand the public sector.</p> \n<p>Not only to create jobs but to protect the community. We need, as a massive structural augmentation, a significantly enhanced and expanded public sector. I\u2019m not just talking about an expansion of infrastructure and staffing levels; we need to re-imagine the public sphere, expanding our view of its role in building a common future based on the common good, a view that has been displaced by the false construct of austerity coupled with the ideology of \u201cthe market knows (and does everything) best\u201d.</p> \n<p>I write this at a time when the government has shamefully allowed the austerity impulse to kick in <em>vis a vis</em> the public sector, imposing an economically irrational and socially harmful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/freezing-public-servant-wages-in-response-to-coronavirus-is-just-a-sop\">wage freeze</a> on public sector workers.</p> \n<p>It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive list of infrastructure projects. Because we need a robust, participatory and transparent process by which this is determined (as opposed to the sports rorts model!), rationally mapped out on the basis of current and projected social and economic need.</p> \n<p>This is work that must begin now. The first priority should be the provision of a significant social and economic infrastructure investment to First Nations communities, the shape of which, and this cannot be emphasised too strongly, should be determined by those communities. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/plea-for-tents-or-anything-to-help-with-self-isolation-in-overcrowded-indigenous-communities\">Lorena Allam</a> points out: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/20/we-are-begging-for-housing-the-crisis-in-indigenous-communities\">Crowding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</a> occurs at around three times the rate of the non-Indigenous population, with over 115,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households living in overcrowded homes nationwide.\u201d</p> \n<p>We need a massive injection of public resources into the construction of public housing.

Disastrous for people\u2019s lives.</p> \n<p>Other obvious and urgent areas of expansion include Services Australia (building on the government\u2019s recently announced boost to Centrelink staff, whilst cognisant of the staffing cuts since 2013 and the ridiculous capping of the APS to 2006-07 staffing levels or below) and the public health system (physical infrastructure and staffing levels, including community health and aged and community care). </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/28/jobactive-agencies-to-reap-millions-amid-soaring-coronavirus-unemployment\">Jobactive agencies to reap millions amid soaring coronavirus unemployment</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Also, the progressive replacement of the<a href=\"https://percapita.org.au/our_work/working-it-out-employment-services-in-australia/\"> jobactive network</a> with a fit-for-purpose commonwealth employment service, a good opportunity to scrape such barnacles as the hyper-exploitative PaTH, the dead-end work-for-the-dole, the inherently racist Community Development Program and the punitive ParentsNext.</p> \n<p>The centrepiece of reconstruction should be a social guarantee, with full employment at its heart.

We should have a vision with an actual industry policy that embraces the opportunities of a post-carbon economy, a vision that enables and encourages equitable access to higher education and that values and boosts research and innovation instead of lazily leaving it to a private sector that cannot be expected to fill the strategic role that government has so spectacularly abrogated.</p> \n<p>Although, as the economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/the-covid-19-crisis-is-a-chance-to-do-capitalism-differently?CMP=share_btn_link\">Mariana Mazzucato</a> points out, this abrogation is exactly what has been expected of governments according to the neoliberal framework conjured up by narrow interests: \u201cSince the 1980s, governments have been told to take a back seat and let business steer and create wealth, intervening only for the purpose of fixing problems when they arise.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We have a right to expect more from government. We have a right to expect government to do what markets cannot, namely, achieve collectively what we cannot achieve alone: social and economic protection for all of us.</p> \n<p>A social guarantee encompasses all that makes people feel human and valued as members of a society. It means no one missing out on the essentials of life: a place to live, a place to work (and decent income support for those who cannot), a place to learn, a place to heal. It means, for example, an overhaul of education funding so that public schools and the education workforce are properly invested in, rather than being allowed to languish in fulfilment of the ideological fantasy that giving more to already well-resourced private schools is somehow equitable. As for Tafe, successive governments have allowed this national treasure to be denuded in the false interests of competition.

The pair met seven years ago and, until the shutdown, worked together at a pottery workshop.</p> <p>\u201cIn some of my toughest times, Deb has been the family in Sydney I didn\u2019t have.

We can talk to neighbours at a distance, but for most part it\u2019s just the four of us in a house 24/7. We rarely went out before things changed, but it was always an option if we needed a break.\u201d</p> <p>And the family reunions will still have to wait. The pair are originally from Queensland, and the state border is still closed to people who aren\u2019t residents or essential workers.</p> <p>\u201cMost of our friends and all the grandparents are in Brisbane,\u201d Brady says. It shows how, though the lockdowns are partially relaxed, there is still much that people can\u2019t or aren\u2019t quite ready to do yet.</p> <p>Regardless, any outing feels like a blessing.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go all out \u2013 for us it\u2019s about extending our isolation circle just a little to feel a bit more human,\u201d Brady says. \u201cHarry being able to play with another kid is something I\u2019m really looking forward to.

  "<p>Like a lot of people, I am not sleeping as well as I was a few months ago.</p> <p>I am still able to nod off fairly easily, and unlike many, my sleep is not often broken with fits of staring anxiously at the ceiling. I am, however, waking up much earlier, well before dawn.</p> <p>I live in a very quiet suburb at the best of times \u2013 the nearest train line and major highway half an hour\u2019s walk away. But lately, in the pre-dawn darkness, the world outside my window is as still as death: no car engines warming up in commuters\u2019 driveways, no pounding footfall of joggers on a pre-work run. All is unnervingly silent, as if the world is broken and I am alone with my dark thoughts.</p> <p>But then I hear those first, welcome notes. Some mornings it\u2019s the comforting soft carolling of the Australian magpie, others it\u2019s the repetitive, urgent piping of gangs of noisy miners. Soon they will be joined by the silvery song of the grey butcherbird, the smaller cousin of the magpie whose large beak tricks people into thinking they are baby kookaburras. The local pied currawongs might chip in with their evocative chimes resonating in the stillness. The screech of rainbow lorikeets hurtling towards their morning feast of nectar from the neighbourhood flowering gums punctuate the air.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/26/i-can-see-a-bird-what-is-it-a-beginners-guide-to-backyard-birding\">'I can see a bird. What is it?': a beginners' guide to backyard birding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sepulchre of night is peeled back as the world turns towards the light of the new day. Listening to the contributions of each member of the voluble choir spurs feelings of wonder and gratefulness to be alive on our sublime planet. The dawn chorus reconnects me to life; a sense of hope returns. It is my favourite moment of each of these strange, new days.</p> <p>Birds link sky and earth, they migrate across hemispheres, traverse the vast oceans. From Indigenous creation stories to Aristophanes to the Norwegian myths of Odin and his two ravens that report daily to him about their flights around the globe, birds were considered as messengers, connecting us to other realms. Roman auguries took this literally, interpreting bird behaviour as signs from the gods.</p> <p>In our noisy, industrial society, birdsong has largely been drowned out, all too easy to ignore. However, in the quietude of lockdown and isolation many of us have once again become attuned to their sound breaking the silence. BirdLife Australia has been inundated with people wanting to share or have identified the birds who have been visiting their garden. </p> <p>One Melbourne birdwatcher started an online movement, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/205589647381934/\">#birdthefeckathome</a> which encourages people to record birds they have seen in their backyards. Since launching at the end of March, the site has logged over 2,600 species \u2013 around a quarter of the world\u2019s birds. In the radio talkback segments I\u2019ve been doing, callers are freaking out that the birds \u201cwere going crazy\u201d but almost all the behaviours described were fairly standard for Australian birds who are a gregarious and outlandish lot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b4841594c3779bc4a1e8ec9cdd95bfc5430df850\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4841594c3779bc4a1e8ec9cdd95bfc5430df850/582_0_1993_1933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainbow lorikeets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"970\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainbow lorikeets captured in a small nature reserve in Sydney</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rita VP/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The difference is, confined to our homes all day, surrounded by a quiet most of us have never experienced, we are noticing for the first time the daily soap operas of the feathered characters we share our surrounds with. Even in the high-rise midst of our city centres people are noticing cockatoos, currawongs and pigeons living pretty much as they did before the virus.</p> <p>Birdsong still welcomes the dawn every morning and I find enormous comfort in that. This is why on Sunday I plan to rise early and acknowledge the joy those sounds bring as part of International Bird Chorus Day. It was started by British naturalist Chris Baines in 1984 who roped in some friends to celebrate a significant birthday by joining him to listen for the first bird calls of the day.</p> <p>At this time of year, the migrant songbirds have returned to the English countryside and fill the air with their sweet, lilting warblings. Though some, such as Adam Lindsay Gordon and his \u201csongless, bright birds\u201d or more recently \u2013 and more delightfully \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Tez9DnRlF/\">Sam Neill and his raven impersonations</a> might regard Australian birds as a raucous cacophony, the fact is that songbirds evolved in Australia and our birds, as vocally splendid as they are boldly marked, do not need the impetus of spring to belt out a squawk or two.</p> <p>On Sunday I will be listening for these comforting, yet bittersweet sounds \u2013 palpable reminders of the natural world I am cut off from, while at the same time providing me an essential connection to the world I once knew, the world to which I want to return.</p> <p><em>Sean Dooley is national Public affairs manager at BirdLife Australia</em></p>",

However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland\u2019s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.\u201d <br><br>She added: \u201cWe had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it\u2019s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.\u201d <br><br>When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to state that

<br><br>\u201cDuring the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. <br><br>\u201cWhat we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. <br><br>\u201cEvery woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance.\u201d <br><br>Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant

she is concerned high-risk pregnancies may be missed due to the pandemic, leading to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. <br><br>Addressing the health and social care committee, Gill Walton said: \u201cSome of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. <br><br>\u201cI believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. <br><br>\u201cI do think it\u2019s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.\u201d <br><br>Walton said that follow-ups on women who miss scans and appointments has been enhanced. <br><br>She added: \u201cOne of the positives from the pandemic is the use of

  "<p>A Pakistani journalist living in exile in Sweden and who had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/exiled-pakistani-journalist-goes-missing-in-sweden\">missing since March</a> has been found dead in a river.</p> <p>Sajid Hussain, who was granted political asylum in Sweden in 2019 after fleeing Pakistan, had been missing since 2 March. He was last seen boarding a train to Uppsala, a city 35 miles (56km) north of Stockholm.</p> <p>\u201cHis body was found on 23 April in the Fyris river outside Uppsala,\u201d Jonas Eronen, a police spokesman, said.</p> <p>Hussain had been living with a friend, Abdul Malik, in Stockholm when he went missing. Malik said Hussain had been in a good mood before leaving for Uppsala on 2 March. His wife, Shahnaz Baloch, said she had spoken to Hussain over the phone that morning and he had been in good spirits, discussing his plans to move to a new apartment in Uppsala.</p> <p>\u201cWe just want police to investigate the cause of death and give an answer to his family and friends,\u201d said Malik. \u201cWe want to know what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Hussain fled Pakistan in 2012 after his reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/balochistan-pakistans-secret-dirty-war\">forced disappearances and human rights violations in the</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/balochistan-pakistans-secret-dirty-war\"> Balochistan region</a> had resulted in the police raiding his house and interrogating his family. He also received death threats.</p> <p>Eronen said a crime could not be completely ruled out, but that Hussain\u2019s death could equally have been an accident or suicide.</p> <p>\u201cThe autopsy has dispelled some of the suspicion that he was the victim of a crime,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as a crime cannot be excluded, there remains the risk that his death is linked to his work as a journalist,\u201d said Erik Halkjaer, the head of the Swedish branch of Reporters without Borders (RSF).</p> <p>RSF said Hussain\u2019s controversial profile meant it could not be ruled out that he had been abducted and killed \u201cat the behest of a Pakistani intelligence agency\u201d. The country\u2019s foreign ministry declined to comment.</p> <p>Hussain had continued his journalism as chief editor of the Baluchistan Times, an online magazine he founded, from abroad. He wrote about drug trafficking, forced disappearances and a long-running insurgency.</p> <p>He had arrived in Sweden in 2018, after previously moving from the United Arab Emirates to Oman and Uganda. According to his family and friends, he was in the process of bringing his wife and two children to join him in Sweden, and had been due to start a post-graduate degree at the University of Uppsala.</p> <p>Pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, who are regularly harassed and killed. According to the 2019 RSF press freedom index, Pakistan ranked 142 out of 180 countries.</p>",
  "<p>Cities around the world are already planning for life after Covid-19, with a series of environmental initiatives being rolled out from Bogot\u00e1 to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown.</p> <p>Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to implement huge economic stimulus packages.</p> <p>Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle.</p> <p>The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future \u2013 and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution.</p> <p>The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis.</p> <p>The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the <a href=\"https://www.c40.org/\">C40 group of cities</a>, said: \u201cOur immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>The mayors discussed measures ranging from huge retrofitting programmes to make buildings more energy efficient, to mass tree planting and investment in solar and wind power.</p> <p>The mayor of Montr\u00e9al, Val\u00e9rie Plante, who attended the video meeting, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cWe need more than ever to position our economic recovery in the context of our fight against climate change. It is also clear to me that our economic recovery must go hand in hand with our social recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Milan has introduced one of Europe\u2019s most ambitious cycling and walking schemes, with 22 miles of streets to be transformed over the summer.</p> <p>In Paris, the mayor has allocated \u20ac300m for a network of cycle lanes, many of which will follow existing metro lines, to offer an alternative to public transport.</p> <p>In Bogot\u00e1, the Colombian capital, a 75-mile network of streets usually turned over to bicycles one day a week <a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/bogota-expands-bike-lanes-overnight-to-curb-coronavirus-spread-5127\">will now be traffic-free all week</a>, and a further 47 miles of bike lanes are being opened to reduce crowding on public transport and improve air quality.</p> <p>New York has <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/04/27/breaking-de-blasio-commits-to-100-miles-of-open-streets/\">unveiled plans to open up 100 miles</a> of streets for \u201csocially responsible recreation\u201d during the Covid-19 crisis, with a focus on areas with the most need, while Oakland, in California,<strong> </strong>is closing off 75 miles of its streets to passing cars and setting aside up to 10% of streets for recreation.</p> <p>Mexico City is planning 80 miles of temporary bike lanes, and Barcelona is adding <a href=\"https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20200425/48704357907/barcelona-espacio-coches-aceras-carriles-bici-desconfinamiento-coronavirus.html\">30,000 square metres to its pedestrianised networks</a> and 13 miles to the biking network.</p> <p>In the UK, the Scottish government has announced \u00a310m to create pop-up walking and cycling routes, while mayors in northern England have suggested a national programme to retrofit homes with renewable energy technology. On Thursday Manchester city council announced it would pedestrianise part of Deansgate, in the city centre. In London, boroughs including Lambeth and Hackney have announced measures to widen pavements, close roads to traffic and improve walking and cycling.</p> <p>Dr Rachel Aldred, at the University of Westminster, said the action city leaders take in the next few weeks would be critically important. \u201cThis is a really important moment. There is the potential to lock in the reduction in air pollution we have seen over the past weeks if we get this right, but as people begin to go back to work and can\u2019t or don\u2019t feel safe using public transport, there is the potential to instead lock in a huge increase in car use and pollution.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. \u201cThere is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings \u2026 C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.\u201d</p> <p>Watts said although many of these initial measures had been billed as short term, he expected them to endure. \u201cThis is how cities are going to function for the next two years, and probably that will transition \u2013 if we have a green economic recovery \u2013 into permanence.\u201d</p> <p>Daisy Narayanan, the director of urbanism at Sustrans, agreed that the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis could be \u201ca catalyst for long-lasting change in the way we live and travel, especially in towns and cities. What Covid-19 has also done is to highlight the crossovers between the quality of our places, public health, economy, transport, education, air quality and social justice.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks scientists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/21/preliminary-study-links-air-pollution-to-coronavirus-deaths-in-england\">tentatively linked</a> air pollution to Covid-19 mortality rates and even the spread of the virus. Narayanan added: \u201cAction needs to be taken now which will help people move around without the congestion, pollution and ill-health that comes with car use now and after lockdown is lifted.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Seven things city leaders can do to drive a green, fair recovery from Covid-19</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Remove through motor traffic from residential streets and extend pavements near shops, schools and parks to make walking safe and enjoyable for transport and exercise.</p></li> <li><p>Introduce safe access routes on foot, bike and scooter from homes to parks and green spaces and introduce automatic pedestrian lights at crossings so people do not have to push buttons and risk infection.</p></li> <li><p>Establish safe cycle routes to and from work for key workers, especially hospital staff, by closing roads and carriageways where necessary so people have a safe alternative to private cars and public transport.</p></li> <li><p>Create safe walking and cycling routes to and from schools, and close down streets around schools to motor vehicles at drop-off and pickup times.</p></li> <li><p>Use libraries, schools and sports stadiums to distribute nutritious, sustainably produced food to communities that need it most, and scale up food waste collection and treatment, including distributing household composting kits and guidance.</p></li> <li><p>Retrofit all public buildings, many of which are empty now, drastically improving energy efficiency and creating thousands of green jobs.</p></li> <li><p>Work with other cities to invest the billions tied up in city funds and pensions in climate solutions to drive green job creation and create a more resilient and sustainable economy.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Thousands of workers stream in single file, at dawn and mid-afternoon, to suit up in masks and chain gloves and put their lives on the line so you can put cheap sausage on your biscuit.</p> <p>They are accustomed to living in fear \u2013 of starvation from drought in Guatemala, or death squads in El Salvador or drug cartels in Mexico. Of being hunted and caged, whether documented or not. And now, of meeting their fate over a pork chop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/trump-executive-order-meat-processing-workers-coronavirus\">Trump is marching meatpacking workers off to their deaths | Steven Greenhouse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s genocide against the working class.

Plants won\u2019t even close for a deep cleaning when a deadly pathogen is found. The president said he is protecting companies from liability \u2013 you know, in case somebody keels over because of someone else\u2019s negligence.</p> <p>Across America, packing plants for beef, pork, chicken and turkey have been closing as workers fall ill with Covid-19 or die. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has <a href=\"https://www.supermarketnews.com/issues-trends/ufcw-more-5000-food-industry-employees-not-work-due-coronavirus\">said</a> that at least 72 of its members have died from coronavirus, and thousands more may be infected; because of the lack of tests, no one knows the true number. Despite <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/presidents-intelligence-briefing-book-repeatedly-cited-virus-threat/2020/04/27/ca66949a-8885-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html\">repeated warnings</a> in the presidential briefing books months ago, nobody instructed industry to gear up or how.</p> <p>In Storm Lake, Iowa, center of the densest livestock-producing region in America, none of the roughly 2,500 pork and turkey processing workers at Tyson Foods plants have been tested for the coronavirus. Hence, Buena Vista county reports only four cases so far, while nearby red meat hub Sioux City is the hottest spot in the USA. Workers\u2019 temperatures are checked. If they feel sick they are advised to stay home. They are told to space out and not crowd into the locker rooms. Plastic hangs between workers on the line. Tyson says it is doing all it can by staggering breaks and spacing workers.</p> <p>Iowa\u2019s governor, Kim Reynolds, a Republican, directed testing resources to Tyson\u2019s Waterloo plant. There, workers are represented by the UFCW. The local sheriff said he wanted a boot slammed down on the slaughterhouse. But in Storm Lake, testing is limited to healthcare and nursing home workers and patients. None for the packinghouse crowd, who are overwhelmingly Latino and non-union.</p> <p>Before the order they did their duty and clocked in. Nobody had to threaten them. They need the check. If you report sick with the virus, you might imagine finding yourself on the next bus to Ju\u00e1rez whether you have papers or not. They want to work \u2013 safely.</p> <p>Tyson says that its workers are documented. But Trump and the likes of the Iowa congressman Steve King, the race-baiting Republican, have Latino workers shaking in their boots. The governor warns that if a plant reopens and you don\u2019t show up, unemployment benefits cease. And then the president orders that the plants shall reopen come hell or a virus. The leaders of the big meatpackers are warning of spot meat shortages \u2013 plant capacity has dropped 40% in recent weeks from worker shortages. You just can\u2019t let this Storm Lake plant shut down. But what happens if it explodes? The anxiety cuts to our quick.</p> <p>Remember, too, that Smithfield Foods is owned by a Chinese conglomerate. Prestage Farms, in Eagle Grove, Iowa, has taken to sending whole hog carcasses to China for lack of further processing help amid our cornfields. This is not really an American food shortage.</p> <p>The supply chain is so tight that when two plants go down \u2013 Smithfield in Sioux Falls and Tyson in Waterloo \u2013 fully 10% of national pork production is knocked out. Everyone has to eat, and they have not yet developed a taste for algae or even tofu. The world eats meat. Shoppers can clear out a grocery display in minutes, and a meat supply in a week.</p> <p>Somebody has to process the hogs and birds that keep coming no matter a virus. Mike Pence called our neighbors heroes. The secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, called them patriots. Trump stopped legal residency permitting for immigrants. Nobody is talking about amnesty or even hearing the refugees. In fact, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told Bloomberg Law nobody is talking about providing undocumented workers healthcare.</p> <p>The state and federal governments did not order slower line speeds or provide protective gear for the packinghouse. Tyson asked for imposed guidance and resources, and got a promise of liability protection from worker claims. But there is this sticky thing called the 10th amendment that does not allow the president to waive corporate liabilities in state courts or workers\u2019 compensation processes, says Storm Lake attorney Willis Hamilton, who has been advocating for food processing employees for nearly 50 years. The order was about instilling fear, Hamilton said. He says his clients are afraid of sick leave and afraid of filing for workers\u2019 comp or unemployment.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to threaten people. These \u2018don\u2019t even think about it\u2019 orders fit into a system that marches workers to their deaths,\u201d Case said. \u201cFear is turning to anger, and that\u2019s when people organize.\u201d</p> <p>Or just pray.</p> <ul> <li><p>Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in north-west Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer prize for editorial writing.

That changes as night draws near, bringing with it the bustle of a normal day. There is no social distancin, and very few face masks to shield people from the virus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Lebanon\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Lebanon\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou think we care about that when people can\u2019t feed themselves?\u201d asked Linda Borghol, as she stirred a large vat in a makeshift food kitchen. \u201cNobody has anything in Tripoli.

The increased cost of imports has been quickly passed on. A freeze on many salaries, controls on bank withdrawals and slashed spending on social services, have also ravaged household incomes.</p> <p>The Lebanese government estimates that 75% of the population are now in need of aid, including food aid.

Over millennia, there has been a consistent pattern to behaviour during epidemics: the hoarding, the panicking, the fear, the blaming, the superstition, the selfishness, the surprising heroism, the fixation with the numbers of the reported dead, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/14/welcome-to-the-quarantine-era-where-bored-lonely-and-trapped-indoors-may-be-the-new-normal\">boredom during quarantine</a>.</p> <p>Defoe would have recognised the impulses behind the strange tableaux of life interrupted in central London: piles of ice melting outside abruptly closed bars; a truck unloading gym equipment at an oligarch\u2019s house in Mayfair; jittery shoppers with overloaded trolleys. \u201cMany families,\u201d he writes, \u201cforeseeing the approach of the distemper laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so entirely, that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased.\u201d</p> <p>The sudden, powerful need to know what\u2019s coming is predictable, too. We turn to historical witnesses who can explain what it\u2019s like. Defoe\u2019s motive for writing <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Marseille in 1720. Anticipating its spread, readers wanted to know what it had been like in 1665. Defoe, responding to demand, provided them with an instant book, fashioned out of statistics, reminiscences, gossip, anecdote and blood-curdling dramatic detail. \u201cPassing through Token-House Yard in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried, \u201cO death, death, death!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cedf7c1086eddf6178b5daa9275ea03a55f1b5d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cedf7c1086eddf6178b5daa9275ea03a55f1b5d0/0_0_5315_3740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Plague In LondonGreat Plague in London, 1665.

Novelistic moments such as these would make the book compelling at any time, but right now it has a painful relevance. Defoe is particularly strong on the unpreparedness and prevarication that made the impact of the plague more severe. Or, as he puts it: \u201cI often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them; and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sunk in that disaster which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68b9b628eb922c50500fd111cbc16d7c543e21dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b9b628eb922c50500fd111cbc16d7c543e21dd/0_0_4134_4121/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bracingly vivid ...

There\u2019s something amazingly bracing about his vividness and curiosity \u2013 the bills of mortality, quoted in full; minor characters such as the <a href=\"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0002773.jpg/full/880%2C/0/default.jpg\">religious </a><a href=\"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0002773.jpg/full/880%2C/0/default.jpg\">fanatic Solomon Eagle</a> who walks around naked with a pan of burning charcoal on his head; and the imprudent John Cock, a barber who is so relieved by the apparent retreat of the epidemic that he returns to normal life too soon and pays the penalty. Moral: don\u2019t be a John Cock.</p> <p>So much of the behaviour of our 17th-century forebears is uncomfortably familiar. The citizens of east London watch complacently as the plague tears through the West End, and assume they will be fine. They\u2019re proved terrifyingly wrong. Defoe adds in a chilling parenthesis: \u201cFor indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come.\u201d</p> <p>Even before germ theory, Defoe\u2019s common sense and perceptiveness led him to conclusions of which our chief medical officer would approve. He gives a prescient warning about the danger of asymptomatic carriers: \u201cThe plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves.\u201d</p> <p>If human behaviour remains dismayingly constant, one thing that has changed for the better is science and our understanding of it. Seven hundred years on, there\u2019s something deeply poignant about Boccaccio\u2019s pre-scientific description of the spread of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/18/mass-grave-shows-how-black-death-devastated-the-countryside\">Black Death</a> in his native Florence. \u201cWhat was particularly virulent about this plague was that it would leap from the sick to the healthy whenever they were together, much as fire catches hold of dry or oily material that\u2019s brought close to it. And that was not all. Not only did speaking with the sick and spending time with them infect the healthy or kill them off, but touching the clothes of the sick or handling anything they had touched seemed to pass on the infection.\u201d You feel like the audience in a pantomime, wanting to shout across the centuries and tell him who the villain is and how he operates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ae05447b0a6414cae1bdc03dfb524ec2d8243f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ae05447b0a6414cae1bdc03dfb524ec2d8243f3/0_0_4500_3119/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Plague of Athens was an epidemic that devastated the city-state of Athens in ancient Greece during the second year of the Peloponnesian War (430 BC) when an Athenian victory still seemed within reach. It is believed to have entered Athens through Piraeus, the city\u2019s port and sole source of food and supplies. Thucydides states that people ceased fearing the law since they felt they were already living under a death sentence. Likewise, people started spending money indiscriminately.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There was particularly high mortality among doctors,\u2019 Thucydides tells of the plague in fifth-century Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone responds to plague by immersing themselves in data about epidemics. The escapist response to disaster is another predictable move and <em>The Decameron </em>epitomises it. After his short but terrifying description of the Florentine plague, Boccaccio sends his troupe of young characters into quarantine, where they spend the remainder of the book, swapping funny, ribald stories: the plague doesn\u2019t feature again. It\u2019s a welcome relief to lose yourself in a world of cuckolds and randy nuns. And once more, <em>plus \u00e7a change.</em> The gilded Florentine youths are doing the 14th-century equivalent of binge-watching <em>Sex Education</em> on Netflix.</p> <p>Thomas Mann and Camus are less interested in plague itself than in using it to make existential points. The plague in <em>Death in Venice </em>is an avatar of death in general, the terrible mystery, the pale horse; it is something that strips away vanity and reveals unpalatable truths. In Mann\u2019s novella, it is the catalyst for Von Aschenbach\u2019s humiliating descent into clownish self-destruction. At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. It\u2019s a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course we\u2019ll all be obliged to consider. \u201c\u2018That is,\u2019 he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, \u2018the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2b07afc189084e27db046c360430d27f9f70445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2b07afc189084e27db046c360430d27f9f70445/0_85_2992_1898/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Neil Bartlett\u2019s adaptation of Camus\u2019 The Plague at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Existential epidemic ... a scene from Neil Bartlett\u2019s adaptation of Camus\u2019 The Plague at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Camus is the real odd one out. <em>The Plague </em>is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed \u2013 Gallic, not in a good way \u2013 but in 2020 it\u2019s like reading <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/14/the-crucible-the-perfect-play-for-our-post-truth-times\">The Crucible</a> </em>while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted.</p> <p>And then, of course, the plague ends. That\u2019s the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. \u201cI shall simply tell it as it happened,\u201d he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, \u201cand describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Should it ever strike again </em>is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. \u201cThere was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure,\u201d Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrow\u2019s paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows.</p> <p>When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoe\u2019s citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camus\u2019s Oran is liberated; its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out.</p>",
  "<p>San Francisco has assembled an army of librarians, social workers, attorneys, investigators and medical students to find and warn anyone and everyone who may have been exposed to Covid-19.</p> <p>Large-scale tracing efforts have been proven to work in other countries, including South Korea and Germany, and are considered crucial to get the United States economy back on track. But tracing efforts in<strong> </strong>a nation as large and diverse as the US come with unique challenges, and California, the country\u2019s most populous state, is one of the first to start to take those challenges on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nursing-homes-california-coronavirus-outbreak-us\">'My mom's life was disposable': inside the California nursing homes unable to contain Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To set up an effective contact tracing program, California will have to increase its health department staff five or 10-fold, experts told the Guardian. The state is eventually planning to recruit 10,000 tracers, according to Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s governor \u2013 and test up to 80,000 people each day, relying on paid health workers and volunteers. But some municipalities are ahead of their curve, and are already beginning to recruit and train tracers.</p> <p>Putting in place a system for tracing and tracking the contacts of people who have tested positive is a \u201cis an absolute essential pillar we need to build up and put in place before we even think about reopening the country\u201d, said Susie Welty, a global health expert at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who is helping build the contact tracing program in the city.</p> <p>Despite its techie reputation, San Francisco has so far eschewed smartphone tracking and contact tracing apps in favor of old-fashioned phone calls. Experts from UCSF have recruited more than 100 city workers who cannot do their regular jobs under the current shelter-in-place rules, taught them healthcare privacy laws, and coached them on how to call Covid-19 patients, assess their needs and ask them about any recent interactions with family, friends and neighbors.</p> <p>Without revealing the infected person\u2019s identity, trackers call everyone they may have interacted with and ask them to self-quarantine for 14 days. \u201cWe know this is really stressful and onerous to the people we call,\u201d said Dr Mike Reid, an assistant professor in infectious disease at UCSF who is leading the city\u2019s contact tracing efforts.</p> <p>Tracers help connect sick or exposed people to any healthcare services they may need, offer to have the city deliver them food and medicine while they\u2019re in quarantine, and offer them a hotel room if they are unhoused or unable to isolate from family members at home. Right now, the city has the capacity to offer tests to everyone with symptoms, Reid said \u2013 but ideally, medical centers will also be able to test everyone who may have been exposed to the virus, regardless of whether they look sick.</p> <p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re just getting started here. This is early, early days,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut the idea is we\u2019ll slowly build up our capacity to trace and test so that we\u2019re prepared for when everything opens back up.\u201d</p> <p>With stringent distancing measures in place, the job has been relatively manageable, Reid said. The average San Franciscan has only three or four contacts \u2013 and they\u2019re usually family members. But once bars, restaurants and other workplaces reopen, contact tracing will be essential to quickly catch and contain new outbreaks. Testing will also have to be scaled up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e0ff2fa442fbc70a058386339520a52504094c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e0ff2fa442fbc70a058386339520a52504094c2/0_81_5142_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vendor picks produce for a customer during the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vendor picks produce for a customer during the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To do so effectively, California will have to meaningfully address inequalities that have baked into society long before the pandemic hit, reaching unhoused and undocumented people who are most vulnerable to illness, and least able to access health services.

In the farming community, where more than 50% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the city has also partnered with community health organizations to reach unhoused and other vulnerable populations.</p> <p>San Francisco has similarly <a href=\"https://sfmayor.org/article/san-francisco-launches-innovative-contact-tracing-program-strengthen-coronavirus-response\">publicized</a> that the contact tracing is \u201cvoluntary, confidential, and culturally and linguistically appropriate. Immigration status will have no bearing on these conversations.\u201d</p> <p>Nationally, the US still has a long way to go before contact tracing can become a reliable part of the strategy to reopen. \u201cThe existing public health system is currently capable of providing only a fraction of the contact tracing and voluntary self-isolation capacity required to meet the Covid-19 challenge,\u201d a prominent group of public health officials wrote Monday in letter to House and Senate leaders, noting that lawmakers would need to allocate an additional $46bn to tracing and isolation efforts.</p> <p>Nationally, at least 100,000 contact tracers will be needed to see after Americans who have fallen ill, or have been exposed, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Others estimate that a workforce of 180,000 to 300,000 will be required.</p> <p>Dr Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical officer at Partners in Health in Massachusetts, who is leading the nation\u2019s first statewide contact tracing effort there, said she\u2019s found that calling and educating everyone who may have been exposed to the coronavirus is especially important right now, in the US.</p> <p>Mukherjee, who has worked to fight outbreaks and pandemics around the world, pointed at anti-lockdown protests and misinformation swirling online. \u201cProven scientific fact about an infectious disease was completely shunned and mocked by the president,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we need to make sure people have the information they need to stay safe.\u201d</p>",

Nearly 30% of the 179 active circuit court judges are now Trump appointees.</p> <p>Owing to this extraordinary push, the ideological makeup of the courts has slowly tipped in a conservative direction. Since 2017, three of the courts have \u201cflipped\u201d from a majority of judges appointed by a Democratic president to a Republican-appointment majority.</p> <p>The US court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, which oversees cases in Florida, Alabama and Georgia, has gone from an 8-3 majority of judges appointed by Democrats, with one vacancy, to a 7-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Trump has \u201cflipped\u201d the second and third Circuits, and he has effectively flipped a fourth court, the ninth circuit, some analysts think.</p> <p>\u201cI still like to think there\u2019s a bottom line for even conservative Trump appointees on the court of appeals, that there\u2019s a line there that they won\u2019t cross over, that we\u2019ll remain a country of laws and not men,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. \u201cBut who knows?\u201d</p> <p>Together the ninth, eleventh and fifth circuit courts decide thousands of cases a year with broad repercussions for daily life in America. Here\u2019s a look at how the three courts are changing under Trump.</p> <h2>Eleventh circuit</h2> <p><strong>Florida, Georgia, Alabama</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: Who gets to vote</strong></p> <p>Floridians struck a historic blow in favor of universal suffrage in the 2018 midterm elections, passing a constitutional amendment that restored the right to vote to felons who had completed their sentences. With a 30-point margin of victory, the will of the voters was unambiguous.</p> <p>But the reality of voting in Florida, a key presidential swing state, has been slow to change. Last May, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a law curtailing the right of felons to vote who owe money from legal penalties, significantly rolling back the 2018 referendum result.</p> <p>In reply, would-be voters sued the Republican governor, and now voting rights in Florida are in a very different place from where they seemed to be in November 2018. Instead of being before the electorate, the issue is before the federal courts, which means it is in the hands of judges appointed by Trump.</p> <p>In a ruling expected in the coming months, Trump\u2019s judges could strip the right to vote from the 1.5 million people who had it restored in the 2018 referendum, in defiance of the popular will, potentially swaying the results of the November 2020 election, in a swing state that Trump needs to hold in order to return to the White House.</p> <p>\u201cWe had fears about what these jurists would do when they got on the bench, just from their records,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of People for the American Way (PFAW), which maintains a tracking tool of Trump\u2019s judges called <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-judge-claims-states-cant-be-sued-for-voting-rights-act-violations-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">Confirmed Judges, Confirmed Fears</a>. \u201cThis administration more than any has really been putting movement ideologues on the bench who have an agenda. And once we got far enough into the administration, we realized that the judges about whom we had fears were issuing decisions that were highly problematic.\u201d</p> <p>Rulings by circuit courts, which average about 13 active judges each, are typically issued by randomly selected three-judge panels, meaning that the overall makeup of the court does not directly come into play in every ruling.</p> <p>Over time, however, the composite ideological orientation of a court comes through. And Trump\u2019s judges on the eleventh circuit have shown what critics see as a hostility to a central issue for the state of Florida and the country: voting rights.</p> <p>The legal team representing voters in the Florida felony disenfranchisement case claims in part that the state law was passed with racial and discriminatory intent in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>\u201cThis issue of felony disenfranchisement is a really important issue in the United States,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, a Brennan Center lawyer who is litigating the case.</p> <p>\u201cFlorida\u2019s voters came forward and really made clear that they rejected this, that this wasn\u2019t a policy that voters on any part of the political spectrum believe in. And then we promptly saw the Florida legislature attempt to undo that.\u201d</p> <h2>Ninth circuit</h2> <p><strong>California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: Immigration</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit has gone from an 18-7 majority of active judges appointed by Democrats, with four vacancies, to a much narrower 16-13 majority of judges appointed by Democrats. But the court\u2019s senior judges, who carry about half the caseload of active judges, also issue rulings \u2013 and at the senior level, Republican appointees now outnumber Democratic appointees 10-3.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s already flipped in some ways,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection, of the ninth circuit.</p> <p>Whatever the balance on the bench, activists express concern about decisions coming down from the court, historically one of the most progressive in the country. </p> <p>Trump judges on the ninth circuit have been especially abrasive in immigration cases, denying spousal visas in violation of long precedent and dismissing asylum claims, including in a case where the plaintiff had evidence of murders of multiple family members in his home country.</p> <p>In one dissent, a Trump-appointed judge supported a Trump proclamation banning entry to any would-be immigrant who could not prove either possession of health insurance or an ability to pay for healthcare.</p> <p>The judge ruled that the government would \u201csuffer immediate, irreparable harm\u201d unless the health insurance screen was allowed to stand, <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-36020/19-36020-2019-12-20.pdf?ts=1576882834\">quoting</a> Trump on the \u201cfinancial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose\u201d.</p> <p>Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">analyzes</a> the shifting makeup of federal courts under Trump, said the ninth circuit had undergone \u201ca big change\u201d and noted that the outsized caseload of the circuit, the biggest in the country covering 60 million people, often required visiting judges to fill in.</p> <h2>Fifth circuit</h2> <p><strong>Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: healthcare</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit has gone from a 9-5 majority of active judges appointed by Republicans, with three vacancies, to an 11-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans, with one vacancy.</p> <p>Trump judges on the circuit have boosted key administration projects, especially on immigration, greenlighting $3.6bn in spending on the border wall and taking a chilly view of asylum claims. They have issued rulings inimical to employment equality and fair housing claims, and protected law enforcement from liability for excessive use of force. In a case with ominous resonance under the coronavirus pandemic, the court has defended objections on religious grounds to immunizations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out that four of the courts, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, had Republican-appointed majorities when Trump took office,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cSo he has perhaps strengthened the Republican-appointee majority on those courts by putting younger and perhaps ideologically more committed judges in the place of older Republicans.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">mortality rate</a> is among the 10 highest in the world, at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">240 per million</a> population and steadily rising, and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">nursing homes</a> in Stockholm are now affected.</p> <p>The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-epidemiologist-anders-tegnell-the-target-of-praise-criticism/\">Anders Tegnell</a>, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.</p> <p>But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of \u201cthe bent twig\u201d, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.</p> <p>It began with a self-conceit that seemed more comical than harmful. Why, one columnist <a href=\"https://www.expressen.se/kultur/jonas-gardell/lat-sverige-vara-sverige-i-kampen-mot-corona/\">asked</a>, could we not just \u201clet Sweden be Sweden\u201d? Others <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/kolumnister/a/vQ79VX/svenskarna-ar-minst-lika-coola-som-britterna\">suggested </a>we brand ourselves \u201csmart Sweden\u201d or \u201ckind Sweden\u201d, the country immune to the hysteria of southern Europe.</p> <p>The next step was the ridicule and delegitimisation of opponents. A group of 22 scientists <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/debatt/folkhalsomyndigheten-har-misslyckats-nu-maste-politikerna-gripa-in\">wrote a joint opinion column </a>arguing for a drastic change of strategy. But within a few hours no one was paying attention to the substance of their arguments. Instead the debate came to revolve entirely around the fact that they used Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide\">death numbers that made Sweden look worse</a> than the more cautious estimates of the public health agency. This was certainly clumsy, but did not undermine their main conclusion. Nor does the fact that Sweden does indeed now have close to six times <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-norway-sweden-different-coronavirus-responses-fatality-rates-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">more deaths</a> per capita than neighbouring Norway or Finland.</p> <p>Then came contempt for emotions, mixed with misogyny. Lena Einhorn, one of the 22 critics, was interviewed via videolink from her home. She broached research reports and numbers, but influential columnists focused on <a href=\"https://www.expressen.se/kultur/victor-malm/coronahaveristerna-ar-en-skam-for-sverige/\">making fun of her hair</a> or curtains. Her \u201chysterical\u201d voice when describing the suffering of Covid-19 patients was also widely mocked. The detached response to her by chief epidemiologist Tegnell was hailed as evidence of his credibility. It is true that he speaks clinically about death in terms of statistical curves. But it is equally true that he did not offer much rebuttal of the research reports she quoted.</p> <p>From this trope of Sweden being alone in doing it right, we seem now to have shifted to denying that Sweden is doing anything exceptional at all. An opinion piece by a political scientist <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/debatt/sa-sprids-falska-nyheter-om-den-svenska-coronastrategin/\">suggested</a> that the Guardian had \u201cblacklisted\u201d Sweden, and that its reporting had described Sweden as \u201cfree from restrictions\u201d. \u201cWho would have thought Trump\u2019s fake news would one day turn out to be somewhat real?\u201d he concluded.</p> <p>But these claims are themselves untrue. The Guardian among others rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/dont-judge-swedens-light-touch-on-covid-19-yet-says-minister\">reported</a> the comparatively mild restrictions in Sweden. Nor was it \u201cfake news\u201d when Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Swedish doctors could soon be denying respirators to patients over the age of 80, and even those as young as 60 with underlying health conditions. In fact,<a href=\"https://www.dn.se/sthlm/lakare-vi-tvingas-till-harda-prioriteringar/?fbclid=IwAR3YgZoFabFIYGuaYwYG89JiCWy356YVIkOV1lXgmylXpxs7QN-4VBKzhrs\"> this</a> is now taking place.</p> <p>The public veneration for Tegnell has gone far beyond trust. He has become an icon, <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/kultur/tegnell-hajpen-ett-tecken-pa-svenskars-tillit-till-makten?fbclid=IwAR026SjdEvfAD_m9jPi0n_hMSIzg0xTrD53WWqUC3WUlD2dG0iDxfzbPdMc%20;%20https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/anders-tegnell-har-blivit-en-james-bond-i-svensk-byrakratversion/\">his face appearing on tattoos and baby garments</a>.

This has met with silence, if not approval. It may already have been picked up by the Sweden Democrats, Sweden\u2019s anti-immigration party, who now <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/a/Op997O/aldreomsorgen-ar-inte-en-integrationsatgard\">claim </a>the health of elderly people has been put at risk for the sake of integrating uneducated immigrants.</p> <p>Defenders of the government\u2019s strategy keep repeating that it is too early to evaluate it. But carrying that argument through to its logical conclusion suggests that veneration should also be postponed until the pandemic has passed. Any successful strategy should be transparent and welcome public scrutiny. My fear is that in our vehement defence of the Swedish approach, we have released forces we cannot control.

  "<p>My girlfriend Romy and I are both from Bristol, but in 2016 were living apart. I was in London working as an accountant and she was teaching in Paris. We decided we wanted more time together and an adventure. We packed up our lives and moved to Queenstown, New Zealand. Our time there was amazing: we worked in the day and spent evenings waterskiing, mountain running or barbecuing on the beach.</p> <p>At weekends, we\u2019d explore the South Island, but to do it properly you need a legendary vehicle, something that will just keep going. I found a knackered Toyota Land Cruiser for sale online. When we went to take a look, it turned out to be a neglected prison vehicle with a bird living inside, but it was only \u00a36,000. We spent 18 months repairing it. Then every weekend we\u2019d chuck a mattress in the back and head off on escapades.</p> <p>After a few years, we decided to return to the UK and start building a more dependable life together<strong>.</strong> When it came time to say goodbye to New Zealand, we couldn\u2019t leave the car behind. We researched the 25,000-mile drive from New Zealand to Bristol in depth. It would take 10 months and no one would insure us. But when our families said, \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d we thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Living out of a car together for 10 months felt like a bigger commitment than marriage \u2013 and we hadn\u2019t argued once</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We set off on 16 February 2019 with a mattress, gas cooker, barbecue, two camping chairs, some clothes, a surfboard and a \u00a350 daily budget for fuel and food. After a month on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, we shipped the car to Malaysia and met it in Kuala Lumpur. From there, we drove across 22 countries: Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, by ferry to Italy, Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, France and Britain.</p> <p>As for the highlights \u2013 it\u2019s hard to skip any part. Pakistan\u2019s Passu Cones mountains in late summer provided the best view: I\u2019ve never seen mountains so high. And the two-week drive through northernmost India\u2019s Himalayas, from Manali to Leh, was among the best stretches of road. The locals were friendliest in Pakistan. We were invited to a stranger\u2019s 40th birthday and given the first slice of cake. We\u2019re still in touch over Facebook.</p> <p>Laos, with its limited tourist infrastructure, was the most rewarding adventure with great food. We\u2019d have khao soy (noodle soup) for breakfast with a bucket of fresh juice. In Thailand, we\u2019d wake up with nothing between us and the sea but sand.</p> <p>Crossing the Pakistan-Iran border was the only hairy moment. Tourists are given an armed escort but, as we passed through a military base on the way to the border, the guards were tense and warned that the Taliban were in the area. We passed them several times as our escort yelled at me to keep driving. It was a terrifying half-hour before they dropped us off, but it\u2019s the kind of experience that locals have daily.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/10/experience-i-am-an-instagram-husband\">Experience: I am an Instagram husband</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I serviced the car in most countries, every 3,000 miles. Those were some of my favourite moments. I\u2019d borrow space in a local garage and hang with the mechanics for an hour, chatting using hand gestures.</p> <p>When we arrived in Britain on 11 December, I cried. The light on Dover\u2019s cliffs was beautiful. I hadn\u2019t seen family for two years. Our friends threw a party at the pub, and I proposed to Romy. Living out of a car together for 10 months felt like a bigger commitment than marriage \u2013 and we hadn\u2019t argued once. She said yes.</p> <p>We loved how spontaneous our trip was: we would start each day not knowing where we\u2019d end up; pulling up at the first traffic lights, something or someone would set our whole day in motion.</p> <p>That can\u2019t last for ever. We\u2019re 30 and have been craving roots. We moved to Edinburgh in February. I\u2019m working as an accountant again and Romy\u2019s a social worker, but there\u2019s unlimited potential for exploring here, hopefully with little ones one day.</p> <p>I love seeing the car parked on the driveway, knowing all the cool places it has been. I\u2019m proud of it. Sometimes I\u2019ll give it a kiss. I hope the three of us (me, Romy and the Land Cruiser) can still be together in our 70s, starting journeys together .</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Deborah Linton</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

When I was younger and first started writing songs, I began on [production software] Logic, using tools and working with vocals. So [going back to it] was like muscle memory. I was looking at a load of music in a file I\u2019d created when I was making the album. I found these three songs, and I was like, oh my God, I love these songs \u2013 and it\u2019d be sick if, in isolation, I could finish them and get them out.

The media, but not the public, are being given online access.</p> <p>The supreme court already livestreams its hearings, and some court of appeal hearings are also broadcast live. This year the Ministry of Justice backed expanding camera use in court so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jan/16/judges-sentencing-in-high-profile-court-cases-to-be-televised\">judges sentencing convicted offenders</a> in high-profile criminal cases in England and Wales, including murders, rapes and other serious offences, can be televised.</p> <p>Lammy said: \u201cThere were already huge backlogs in court cases before the Covid-19 crisis began. If urgent decisions are not made now, the justice system will be at breaking point by the autumn.</p> <p>\u201cMany large courtrooms, university lecture halls, schools and leisure centres are currently sitting empty. The Ministry of Justice should co-opt these buildings if necessary to carry out socially distanced trials according to public health advice. Justice delayed must not be allowed to become justice denied.\u201d</p> <p>He said open justice was a fundamental right but current restrictions on non-essential travel meant most members of the public could not attend court.</p> <p>\u201cTo maintain public confidence in the justice system, with a few exceptions, all court cases should be streamed online,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour is calling for the livestreaming of cases to become the norm during and after the Covid-19 crisis because a more transparent system is a fairer system, which gives greater access to justice for us all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cJudges and staff deserve huge credit for keeping dozens of courts open during this pandemic, and have overseen a vast increase in video and audio hearings. The public can be confident that we are doing everything possible to ensure justice is still seen and heard, for instance through remote hearings. While jury trials were suspended to protect the public, we are working closely with the judiciary and others to resume them as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour letter says the opposition wants to work constructively with the government, but \u201cwe have serious concerns regarding not only how the justice system has become incapacitated by the crisis, but also around how our critically weakened infrastructure will cope with the enormous challenge it will face post Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>A first priority must be rebuilding services and restoring some of the legal aid which since 2012 has been stripped from most areas of early legal advice, including housing, family matters, employment, welfare and immigration.</p> <p>To continue the suspension of trials for an \u201cindeterminate time would result in a backlog of cases which could seize [up] the wheels of justice for many years to come. The government must act urgently to allow jury trials to restart in a way that is safe,\u201d the letter says.</p> <p>However, Labour does not support proposals for allowing jurors to participate in trials remotely from home. \u201cUnfortunately, many people across the country do not have [quiet or private rooms] or access to the required technology. Until comprehensive solutions are found to prevent remote juries from becoming socially unbalanced juries, we cannot support them.\u201d</p>",

Now 41, Bernal has alternated between mainstream projects in the US \u2013 such as his five-year stint as an eccentric conductor in the delightful Amazon series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/mar/14/mozart-in-the-jungle-amazon-studios\">Mozart in the Jungle</a>, or his touching voice work as a balladeer trapped in the afterlife in the Disney/ Pixar gem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation\">Coco</a> \u2013 and politically charged work in Latin America.</p> <p>When he calls me today, it is from Mexico City, one of two locations that is home to him (the other is Buenos Aires) and where he happened to be when the lockdown began. \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful right now in Mexico,\u201d he says brightly, \u201cis that straight after the daily 7pm press conference, there are films on TV from the golden age of Mexican cinema, from the 1930s to the 1950s. It\u2019s been wonderful to watch them in this light. I see the hopes of the actors and film-makers from 70 or 80 years ago. I see their fears, their experiments, what they were trying to build and express. I find it all incredibly moving as a document of humanity.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks the current crisis is altering for ever the way we look at art. \u201cThere\u2019s something more straightforward now in how we see things \u2013 it\u2019s stronger, more elemental and pulsating. We\u2019re so emotionally charged. Artistic expression can affect us for the better, making us feel we\u2019re all in this questioning together.\u201d</p> <p>It is, he suggests, an ideal state in which to approach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/ema-review\">Ema</a>, his third film with the Chilean director Pablo Larra\u00edn, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/no-film-review\">No</a>, about the 1988 plebiscite on Pinochet, and the fantasy-biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/07/neruda-review-pablo-larrain-gael-garcia-bernal\">Neruda</a>, in which he played a police inspector who doubts his own existence. Ema is the pair\u2019s most challenging collaboration, populated largely by destructive and dislikable characters; only gradually do their prickly exteriors peel away to reveal the wounded souls within. Bernal has the small but pivotal role of Gast\u00f3n, a choreographer married to the dancer Ema (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6797988/\">Mariana Di Girolamo</a>). He is plainly callous \u2013 he taunts her over their recent failed adoption of a seven-year-old boy \u2013 but Bernal shows that Gast\u00f3n is suffering, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d04556121977f4a6dabf48c32253f0913249ba5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d04556121977f4a6dabf48c32253f0913249ba5d/0_0_3098_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As a young Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As a young Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Prandini/Imagenet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is something about the nature of his job that makes him feel very lonely. That was interesting to explore: he\u2019s the centre of gravity at this dance company, he puts everything together, and that leads to a lot of loneliness. It\u2019s like directing a film, which is a solitary pursuit even though it\u2019s collective.\u201d Bernal himself has directed two features \u2013 the 2007 drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJzIuap2Jo8\">D\u00e9ficit</a> and the as-yet-unreleased <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZShahG9SeI\">Chicuarotes</a>, about young Mexican hoodlums \u2013 as well as founding, with his childhood friend and Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n co-star Diego Luna, two production companies and a documentary film festival, Ambulante.</p> <p>So could Gast\u00f3n be a portrait of himself or Larra\u00edn? \u201cNo, not at all!\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut Pablo and I both understand him in his isolation and his stupefaction.\u201d Perhaps, then, he is comparable to Rodrigo, the conductor from Mozart in the Jungle, who is also a restless, demanding creative type? \u201cYes! Except that Rodrigo represents happiness and adventure, whereas Gast\u00f3n is the opposite. Rodrigo is Maradona. Gast\u00f3n is more like Mike Tyson.\u201d</p> <p>His role in Ema is notable for keeping his usual electrifying charm in check; if Gast\u00f3n is sexual, it is only in the most remote, reptilian way. Such unpalatable parts are rare on Bernal\u2019s CV. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/31/5\">Fernando Meirelles\u2019s Blindness</a>, he played an unscrupulous bartender taking advantage of an epidemic that renders its sufferers sightless; in one scene, he performed a head-waggling, bad-taste version of I Just Called to Say I Love You. And in The King, his English-language debut from 2005, he was a psychopath calmly wreaking revenge on his long-lost father.</p> <p>\u201cGael had balls, to be blunt,\u201d says James Marsh, that picture\u2019s British director. \u201cWe went to quite a few up-and-coming young American actors, some of whom have big careers now, and none of them would go near that script. But Gael liked the idea of playing someone with this cold surface. I love way he moves in the film: he\u2019s always slinking around, more animal than human. The character has pure evil in him, but he played it in this blank way so that you didn\u2019t hate him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s this incredible ease about Gael. I think he works far harder than one would imagine</p> <footer> <cite>Saffron Burrows</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nor, by the end of Larra\u00edn\u2019s picture, do we hate Gast\u00f3n. Whether we understand him is another matter, one that Bernal thinks may not be so important. \u201cThat\u2019s always the dilemma, right? Understanding. What the hell does it mean? There is that saying. I think it was Picasso, no? Someone said they didn\u2019t understand his work. So he asked them: \u2018You like eating eggs in the morning? You like your <em>huevos rotos</em>?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I like them.\u2019 \u2018OK. But do you <em>understand</em> them?\u2019\u201d He chuckles at that.</p> <p>It is better, he says, for the audience to \u201cknow that they don\u2019t know\u201d the character\u2019s motivations. \u201cThat\u2019s the journey you embark on when you\u2019re building a character. Little by little, the pieces come together. OK, how would this character feel in the rain? What would he do outside? And you start to discover them. Playing Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, there came a point where I could improvise a whole day of his life. I had that ownership of what he would do in any situation. That\u2019s the nirvana of acting: being able to go into places where you\u2019re not sure what the hell is going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Saffron Burrows, one of Bernal\u2019s co-stars on Mozart in the Jungle, witnessed his process up close. \u201cThere\u2019s this incredible ease about Gael,\u201d she tells me. \u201cOne thing that was so enjoyable was his improvising, the little riffs he developed, the surprises. Every take was very different. I think he works far harder than one would imagine. Sometimes we\u2019d be doing the same scene for nine hours and I\u2019d see him mulling, working stuff out, honing it.\u201d She and Bernal go way back: they starred together as honeymooners in David Nicholls\u2019s short play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jun/22/theatre1\">Aftersun</a>, staged at the Old Vic in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bf9d6316a22a74b53c1419ff7a4b837720723fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bf9d6316a22a74b53c1419ff7a4b837720723fd/78_70_4271_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernal with Saffron Burrows in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernal with Saffron Burrows in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burrows even recalls frequenting the bar where he worked while he was a drama student in the late 90s. \u201cI used to go bobbing about with friends at this Cuban place in Islington where he was the barman. He\u2019s had that London training and he\u2019s always carried this internationalism about him. He\u2019s very welcoming. When we were making Mozart, he was always at the helm, always being the host.\u201d</p> <p>Although necessarily remote as Gast\u00f3n, he does get to reveal the character\u2019s churning inner turmoil during a frantic speech railing against his wife\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cThere are some opinions he has which I share,\u201d Bernal says. \u201cWhen he mocks the idea of going to Los Angeles and taking selfies, for instance. I would say there is no bigger treason for humankind. It\u2019s throwing your life away. I know it sounds horrible. But going to Los Angeles and taking selfies serves absolutely no transcendent purpose!\u201d</p> <p>Bernal resisted that city\u2019s siren call even before he and his former partner, the Argentine actor Dolores Fonzi, had two children: a son, L\u00e1zaro, now 11, and a daughter, Libertad, who is nine. He stayed put. \u201cNot because I didn\u2019t want to take selfies! There are just so many stories I wanted to tell. I wanted to change things with my own hands, not follow someone else\u2019s route.\u201d</p> <p>Marsh thinks that Bernal\u2019s integrity is vital to his acting. \u201cI have enormous respect for him and how he refused to take the easy path. He could easily have gone to Hollywood and become Antonio Banderas, but he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s stretched himself and matured into a great artist.\u201d Cuar\u00f3n, who went on to direct Bernal and Luna in the football saga Rudo y Cursi, agrees. \u201cGael and Diego are the most respected actors of their generation in Mexico. He\u2019s involved with social issues like immigration, and he\u2019s very outspoken politically. He is both criticised and celebrated, depending on who is in government here. And though he has lived everywhere, he has never left Mexico or stopped being involved in Mexican issues.\u201d</p> <p>Even noble, conscientious actors are only human. Has he ever taken any roles purely for the money? \u201cOh, there have been one or two,\u201d the actor says ruefully. I invite him to name and shame them, but he declines with a giggle: \u201cNoooo!\u201d So let\u2019s just say it is oddly comforting that even a performer as good as he is can still make films as poor as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/letters-to-juliet-review\">Letters to Juliet</a>, where he played Amanda Seyfried\u2019s insufferable boyfriend, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/03/a-little-bit-of-heaven-review\">A Little Bit of Heaven</a>, in which he was an oncologist who falls for Kate Hudson as she dies photogenically and at great length.</p> <p>\u201cI did certain projects I wasn\u2019t too sure of,\u201d he admits. \u201cSometimes there would be a pleasant surprise, sometimes a very bad one where I\u2019d think: \u2018It\u2019s not worth it, man. What am I doing?\u2019 If this pandemic has made me learn one thing, it is that I have to work less. I need to nurture and have something to say.\u201d</p> <p>So he\u2019s not going to do another film he doesn\u2019t believe in? \u201cI think so, yeah. It\u2019s a commonplace thing to say. But now, thanks to this situation, it\u2019s even more acute, right? I\u2019m just going to do what I like. I\u2019m going to be stricter about that from now on.\u201d</p> <p><em>Ema is </em><em>available on free preview on 1 May, and then normally on Mubi from 2 May</em></p>",

There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.</p> <p>While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To reach my grandparents\u2019 house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region\u2019s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area\u2019s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits \u2013 mangoes, lychees and guava \u2013 that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.</p> <p>The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old <a href=\"https://mosaicscience.com/story/cholera-haiti/\" title=\"\">inscription</a> at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the <a href=\"https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/cholera\" title=\"\">clinical picture</a> of patients afflicted by severe cholera: \u201cThe lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.\u201d</p> <p>In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.</p> <p>Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don\u2019t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.</p> <p>For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera\u2019s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm\" title=\"\">originated</a> in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it.</p> <p>Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.</p> <p>In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95/0_0_2048_1344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SCHALK/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called <a href=\"https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/resources/view/34622/\" title=\"\">Isabella Hazard</a>. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the panic created by the \u201cBlue Death\u201d, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory \u2013 that the disease was associated with \u201cbad airs\u201d (or \u201cmiasmas\u201d) \u2013 inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets \u201cto destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys\u201d.</p> <p>So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_outbreaks_and_pandemics\" title=\"\">millions</a> of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary <a href=\"https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/133436/7/133436.pdf\" title=\"\">Mario Adorno</a> accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting \u201ca devilish plot bent on poisoning the people\u201d of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them.</p> <p>But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive \u2013 they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.</p> <p>When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by \u201cmiasmas\u201d. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg\" title=\"\">dot map</a> of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same <a href=\"https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854\" title=\"\">water pump</a> on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08/0_512_2912_3640/800.jpg\" alt=\"A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow\u2019s revelations led to the creation of \u201cImprovement Trusts\u201d and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but <a href=\"https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/india70-a-brief-colonial-history-of-sanitation-in-india-10602/\" title=\"\">only 1%</a> of Indians outside the colonial walls.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://pragati.nationalinterest.in/2014/08/indias-sanitation-story/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn\u2019t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>John Snow\u2019s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.</p> <p>In Florence, a contemporary of Snow\u2019s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.</p> <p>Pacini <a href=\"http://ccras.nic.in/sites/default/files/viewpdf/jimh/BIIHM_1978/32%20to%2038.pdf\" title=\"\">studied</a> the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue.</p> <p>Pacini recognised that these dots \u2013 which he called \u201c<em>vibrios</em>\u201d (commas), because of their shape \u2013 must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.</p> <p>Pacini had discovered the \u201cgerm\u201d, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, <a href=\"https://peoplepill.com/people/hemendra-nath-chatterjee/\" title=\"\">Hemanda Nath Chatterjee</a> developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.</p> <p>Six years later, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhu_Nath_De\" title=\"\">Sambhu Nath De</a> discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed \u2013 like whole spices \u2013 even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63/0_94_2883_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, it\u2019s easy for westerners to get their hands on the <a href=\"https://jcdr.net/articles/PDF/13376/13050_F(SHU)_PF1(KB_SL)_PN(SL).pdf\" title=\"\">most effective vaccine</a>, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It\u2019s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e4ZVQvVDH5c\" title=\"\">protect you</a> for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don\u2019t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-6-000-is-6-of-a-small-farmer-s-annual-income-according-to-nsso-data/story-rddMw0hk6cSbxjo7E1GyKK.html\" title=\"\">average Indian farmer</a> would have to work for three whole days.</p> <p>There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That\u2019s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.</p> <p>There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes \u2013 the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.</p> <p>So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.</p> <p>Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera\u2019s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De\u2019s seminal research, a new pandemic \u2013 the seventh \u2013 sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.</p> <p>This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30737-6/fulltext\" title=\"\">International Sanitary Conference</a>, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315613598/chapters/10.4324/9781315613598-7\" title=\"\">Anne-Emanuelle Birn</a>, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">WHO</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated \u2013 not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/cholera/the-forgotten-pandemic/en/\" title=\"\">3 million cases</a> and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455997/\" title=\"\">cholera</a> claimed more lives than the <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/epidemic_diseases/cholera/cholera_009.jpg?ua=1\" title=\"\">map</a> of the places still struggling with cholera shows <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/maintaining-the-momentum-against-cholera/\" title=\"\">47 countries</a> \u2013 in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer <a href=\"https://www.medicinasocial.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/viewFile/12/211\" title=\"\">have shown</a>, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates \u2013 despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.</p> <p>The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2016/07/116493/micronesia-ebeye-island-missile-test-photos#slide-1\" title=\"\">another nearby island, Ebeye</a>. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to <a href=\"https://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org/blog/isolation-and-disparity-kwajalein-atoll-noah-rose\" title=\"\">nine people</a>, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.</p> <p>At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Reiss/USGS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.</p> <p>What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.</p> <p>It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-could-circulate-forever-says-experts\" title=\"\">fears</a> that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/could-we-be-living-with-covid-19-forever\" title=\"\">four endemic coronaviruses</a>; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world\u2019s poorest regions.</p> <p>The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.</p> <p>There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1805769/coronavirus-chinese-middlemen-deplete-africa-facemasks-supply/\" title=\"\">buying up</a> so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik\" title=\"\">outsourcing</a> of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world\u2019s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/openmovements/widening-data-divide-covid-19-and-global-south/\" title=\"\">digital infrastructure</a> necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called \u201c10/90 gap\u201d, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world\u2019s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right.</p> <p>Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2013/10/08/richard-smith-moving-from-global-heath-3-0-to-global-health-4-0/\" title=\"\">has compared</a> the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls \u201cGlobal Health 4.0\u201d: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/trump-decision-cut-who-funding-international-vandalism-coronavirus\" title=\"\">removal of funding</a>, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.</p> <p>Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone\u2019s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam <a href=\"https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=ijgls\" title=\"\">has written</a> that \u201cenormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability\u201d. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.</p> <p>To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a \u201ccommunitarian globalism\u201d: a bottom-up approach, \u201cbased on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources\u201d. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/aggressive-testing-contact-tracing-cooked-meals-how-the-indian-state-of-kerala-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve/2020/04/10/3352e470-783e-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html\" title=\"\">communist government in Kerala</a> giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the <a href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/30/somalia-sends-20-doctors-to-help-italys-coronavirus-effort\" title=\"\">Somalian doctors</a> offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/cuba-time-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Cuba allowing</a> an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.</p> <p>There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.</p> <p>For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.</p> <p>For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years\u2019 time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>"
