private firms and medical associations ahead of a probable scenario where public hospitals run out of critical care beds. <br></p> \n  <p>Providers will be able to charge a daily fee of up to 16,000 rand ($950) for Covid-19 patients that get treated in critical care beds in private hospitals, <strong>Anban Pillay</strong>, the health ministry\u2019s deputy director-general for national health insurance, told Reuters. <br></p> \n  <p>The fee includes the cost of using the bed, paying a team of specialists to treat the patient and additional services including pathology and radiology. <br><br> Estimates vary widely as to how many critical care beds there are in the country.

pressure to ease restrictions further across the country ahead of the end of its three-week progressive <em>deconfinement </em>programme, after the country\u2019s scientific advisory committee

tourists and France\u2019s borders remain closed except for essential business and personal reasons. Ch\u00e2teau staff said there was a rush on the place on Saturday, but even so they have 4,000 visitors instead of the 20,000 a day on a normal June weekend.</p> \n  <p>France reported 31 new deaths from Covid-19 in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the total to 29,142 since March.

  "<p>George Floyd\u2019s name is now known around the globe; his death has sparked protests from Berlin to Mexico City. The extraordinary cruelty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">his killing</a> has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</p> <p>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</p> <p>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\" title=\"\">David Dungay</a>, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards.

Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\" title=\"\">prefers to remember</a> its abolition of the slave trade to its role in industrialising slavery. It finished paying the bill for reparations to slave owners only five years ago. Many people still see empire as a conduit for the spread of cricket and railways. A broader curriculum, which is surely needed, would reveal it as a system of exploitation and white supremacy, with repercussions felt to this day.</p> <p>BAME people <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">die disproportionately</a> as a result of the use of force or restraint by police, but not one officer has been convicted of manslaughter or murder in decades. Protesters in the UK have highlighted the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, the Metropolitan police\u2019s growing use of stop-and-search, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, the disproportionate exclusion of black boys from schools and the failure to act on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-race-and-criminal-justice-inequality-is-unfair-to-all\" title=\"\">Lammy report</a>, which highlighted glaring disparities in the criminal justice system. But they have also raised the impact of austerity, the Grenfell fire and the fact that BAME people are so much more likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">to die of Covid-19</a>. Racism is structural, and state neglect can be as deadly as state abuse. It does not always take a knee on the neck to kill someone. Poverty, overcrowding, and unequal access to healthcare can be fatal.</p> <p>It is the increased threat from coronavirus which has driven many to the streets. Though protesters have largely been assiduous in their use of face masks and hand gel, there is a real danger that these gatherings will spread infection. Subsequent self-isolation by participants would help to reduce the risks. But when Dominic Cummings got a free pass for his drive to Durham, the leader of the house has forced MPs to return to a crowded chamber, and the government is ignoring warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too quickly, they must not be scapegoated for any rise in infections. Already, black people in London are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\" title=\"\">twice as likely to be fined</a> for breaching coronavirus regulations as white people.</p> <p>To say that black lives matter is not only to demand that they are not stolen, but to insist that they are truly valued. No one expects this to be realised overnight; but nor are they willing to wait. The breadth of the protests is testament to what has gone wrong, but also a promise that change is possible. The protests are black-led but multiracial, showing the growing breadth of support. As in the US, white people are seeking to be allies. Other people of colour are identifying with black experience, while recognising that they too may benefit from racial hierarchies, and may themselves discriminate. Mistakes will be made. But progress can and must be made, too.</p>",

During questions from the <a href=\"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8e8e5214-346d-4be8-adf7-addfc839ff6d\">liaison </a><a href=\"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8e8e5214-346d-4be8-adf7-addfc839ff6d\">committee </a>10 days ago, the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnsons-liaison-committee-appearance-what-did-we-learn\">appeared to be uncertain about the details of this status</a> and promised to review the policy, saying: \u201cPeople who\u2019ve worked hard for this country who live and work here should have support of one kind or another.\u201d</p> <p>Informed about a Children\u2019s Society estimate that there are <a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/news-and-blogs/press-releases/the-children%E2%80%99s-society-responds-to-the-boris-johnsons-questions-about\">more than 100,000 children in this situation</a>, with no safety net, he said: \u201cWe will see what we can do to help.\u201d</p> <p>However, asked again at prime minister\u2019s questions last week about the growing numbers of migrants who are living and working here lawfully, who have been pushed into extreme poverty because of having no recourse to public funds, Johnson appeared to have been briefed on the immigration category.</p> <p>He declared that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d that no recourse to public funds is a policy that applies to people who have temporary immigration status, adding: \u201cBut it is a term of art; it does not mean that they are necessarily excluded from all public funds.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Timms, the Labour MP for East Ham who raised the issue with the prime minister last week, rejected this explanation. \u201cFor very many of those affected that\u2019s exactly what it means,\u201d he said, calling on the government to suspend the condition for the duration of the crisis, at least for families with children.</p> <p>He said: \u201cMany hard-working families in East Ham have leave to remain, but no recourse to public funds. They are suffering severe hardship as a result. I agree with the prime minister\u2019s point at the liaison committee, that people in this position \u201cshould have support of one kind or another\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d69b2b971765130602af4b7e70da87b39f6394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d69b2b971765130602af4b7e70da87b39f6394/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali and Noreen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali and Noreen moved to the UK 15 years ago.

  "<p>\u2018There was one gig we did in Scotland where the girls were screaming so loud that I couldn\u2019t hear us \u2013 and we were not a quiet band,\u201d said Steve Priest in 2017, recalling a typical gig with the Sweet in their 1970s pomp. He might have added that a good few of the screams were directed at him personally.</p> <p>Priest, who has died aged 72, was not just the group\u2019s bassist; he was the member who most enthusiastically explored the presentational possibilities of glam rock, creating a persona that would have served as well in a Christmas panto as it did on Top of the Pops.</p> <p>He made free with makeup, wore floor-length capes and hot pants and effected lash-fluttering camp; Sweet songs were written to include Priest\u2019s vocal interludes, delivered in a maddened falsetto. Chided by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/obituary-david-bowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a> himself for over-egging things, Priest was amused by his failure to get the point: \u201cIt isn\u2019t supposed to be subtle. I\u2019m supposed to look like an old tart.\u201d</p> <p>Priest took to his role as the band peacock with great relish. \u201cEveryone thought I was gay anyway, so I went, \u2018OK, you think I\u2019m gay, I\u2019m going to act gay,\u2019\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekE4DDlBLP0\" title=\"\">said</a> in 2000, but it was often the case that his musicianship was overlooked. A rock bass player at heart, he and the Sweet\u2019s drummer <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mick-tucker-9180524.html\" title=\"\">Mick Tucker</a> were a compact, unshowy rhythm section who foreshadowed punk\u2019s minimalism; his playing, <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/the-sweet-bassist-steve-priest-dies-aged-72\" title=\"\">said the Megadeth bassist Dave Ellefson</a>, was \u201cwithout parallel\u201d.</p> <p>That cut little ice with the Sweet\u2019s many disparagers, who saw only a quartet of men in makeup, with a bassist who took it that little bit further. More audaciously still, they sold 50m records looking that way. Decades after he wore a \u201cgay Nazi\u201d get-up on a 1973 edition of Top of the Pops, Priest was still asked if he had been serious. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how everyone still talks about the Nazi uniform. I mean, a gay Hitler. Hello?\u201d It bears noting that the black and red <a href=\"https://thesweetband.com/store/product/1014/\" title=\"\">jacket</a> of his 1994 memoir, Are You Ready, Steve? \u2013 the title was the first line of the magnificently unhinged single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_jdiU47bFA\" title=\"\">Ballroom Blitz</a> - uses a typeface similar to Third Reich typography.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"821074af8edf7ac2f41a79df79b365caacbcdf0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821074af8edf7ac2f41a79df79b365caacbcdf0a/0_190_2905_1742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sweet in 1971.

From left: Brian Connolly, Steve Priest, Andy Scott and Mick Tucker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rytter/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though he came to rue the image, he viewed the Sweet\u2019s success as the reward for the years of slog that preceded it. Born in Hayes, Middlesex, he grew up encouraged to pursue music by his father, who had played in a Hawaiian band in the 30s.</p> <p>After a spell singing in a choir, he became a fan of the Shadows bass player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/18/jet-harris-obituary\" title=\"\">Jet Harris</a>. Accordingly, he made his own bass guitar and spent the early 60s playing in local bands. In 1968, he was invited to join a group led by the singer <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/obituary-brian-connolly-5581412.html\" title=\"\">Brian Connolly</a> and Tucker. Changing their name from Wainwright\u2019s Gentlemen to Sweetshop, then the Sweet \u2013 by this point, the guitarist Andy Scott had arrived \u2013 they served what Priest described as a hard apprenticeship.</p> <p>Inspired by Deep Purple and the Who, the Sweet were then a nondescript rock band, touring the clubs and releasing a series of singles. Simply making a living at it was fine with Priest, who had become a father during that time.</p> <p>Had it not been for his friend the record producer Phil Wainman introducing the Sweet to the fledgling songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, it is probable that the band would have ended up as no more than a pop footnote. They proved an ideal testing ground for Chinn and Chapman, with the lightweight 1971 single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd8JHqjHJ5U\" title=\"\">Funny Funny</a> becoming the first of the duo\u2019s 11 Top 40 hits for the Sweet. Together with the band\u2019s self-written songs, the Sweet had 16 UK hits. (They included <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNXFtVWB47E\" title=\"\">Block Buster</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM6I-pmV0RA\" title=\"\">Little Willy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yYifj6IsUQ\" title=\"\">Hell Raiser</a>, by anyone\u2019s measure among the best singles of their era.)</p> <p>As \u201cChinnichap\u201d moved on from lukewarm popsmithery to raw, magisterial pop-rock, the Sweet, and especially Priest, took note of glam rock\u2019s increasing hold on the charts. It was the visual aspect that most captivated him and he quickly saw the point of dressing to outrage, especially during their many Top of the Pops appearances. \u201cYou had to outdo everyone else. So you saw what so-and-so was wearing, and then you were going to do Top of the Pops next week and had to come up with something else. Otherwise, you\u2019d just fall into the \u2018I have no idea who that was [category]\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>When Connolly left, after the band\u2019s last big hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRgWvvkSvfk\" title=\"\">Love Is Like Oxygen</a>, in 1978, Priest took over lead vocals until 1982, when the group disbanded. He had moved to New York during that period and married Maureen O\u2019Connor, a publicity executive at the Sweet\u2019s American label, Capitol. Attempts at a solo career, and as a member of a US band called the Allies, were unsuccessful, as was a tilt at reforming the Sweet. He had more success as a property dealer in Los Angeles, where he moved with his family.</p> <p>Like many other former groups with much-loved back catalogues and a fractious ex-membership, three versions of the Sweet began to tour, headed by Connolly, Scott and Priest. The bassist\u2019s group, spurred by observing that Eric Clapton was still on the road (\u201cHe is a lot older than I am and [I was] wondering why I\u2019m not up there\u201d), did not form until 2008. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwAkmxeapu0\" title=\"\">Connolly</a> had died in 1997, but Scott had the rights to the Sweet name in the UK and Australia, and Priest secured them only for North America. In other places, he was compelled to call his edition, comprised mainly of American rock players, Steve Priest\u2019s Sweet.</p> <p>Though he and Scott spent years refusing to speak to each other, when Priest\u2019s death was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avmufbI5ewE\" title=\"\">announced</a>, Scott wrote, \u201cI am in bits right now.\u201d</p> <p>Priest\u2019s first marriage, to Pat, ended in divorce.

  "<p>For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. \u201cCitizens around the world can see change is possible,\u201d says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. \u201cJust put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.\u201d</p> <p>That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/lockdown-effects-mt-everest-visible-from-kathmandu-after-decades-as-pollution-level-goes-down/as75802249.cms\">make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades</a>), Manila (where the <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2020/04/manila-gets-its-skyline-back-as-air-quality-improves-amid-covid-19-lockdown/\">Sierra Madre became visible again</a>) or dozens of other cities across the world.</p> <p>Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year.</p> <p>Having seen the shroud lift, there is a growing clamour not to let it fall again. Cities across the world are exploring ways to permanently reduce pollution. Chafe says there is no quick, one-case-fits-all solution, but there are lessons \u2013 on environmental justice, community activism, urban design, climate ambition, technological innovation and municipal leadership \u2013 that can be learned from the cities and states that were making progress even before the lockdown. Here are three.</p> <h2>Copenhagen</h2> <p>Copenhagen has the world\u2019s most ambitious plan to cut emissions: carbon neutral by 2025. This is pushing the Danish capital to go beyond the existing model of smart, clean urban design and cycle-centred transport that has turned it into one of the cleanest cities in the world.</p> <p>Grassroots activism, pragmatic government and high taxes have been the drivers for change. Old photographs prove the city had as much of a car culture as any European city in the 1970s, when more than 100,000 citizens demonstrated in R\u00e5dhuspladsen (City Hall Square) to demand their streets back. Since then, town planners have steadily reduced parking spaces and widened areas for pedestrians and bicycles.</p> <p>Jeppe Juul, of the Danish Eco Council, says it is a question of priorities. \u201cIt feels good to walk around Copenhagen,\u201d he says, adding that in some areas of the city \u201cpedestrians have more space than bikes, and bikes have more space than cars.\u201d The city now vies with Amsterdam for being the most bicycle-friendly city in the world.&nbsp;This means traffic lights with resting bars that riders can hang on to without touching the ground, take-away coffee containers designed for bikes, and groups that organise parent\u2019s shifts for schools runs on \u201cminibus-like\u201d bicycles that can take up to six children at a time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d/0_224_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Forsberg/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Copenhagen\u2019s 2025 target depends largely on replacing coal-fired heating with biomass, wind and geothermal energy. A new district-heating infrastructure will allow neighbourhoods to scrap home boilers. Urban planners aim to use carbon capture and storage technology to trap emissions from the main municipal waste incinerator.</p> <p>Some still doubt the city will be zero-carbon within five years, but Mikkel Krogsgaard Niss, from the mayor\u2019s office, says sceptics have been proved wrong in the past. \u201cFrom 2014-20, we reduced carbon dioxide by&nbsp;more than 50%, so we are on our way,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>These shifts will create up to 35,000 jobs, with most of the money coming from public coffers. Residents already pay some of the highest rates of tax in the world, but this is seen as <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-01-20/why-danes-happily-pay-high-rates-of-taxes\">an investment in health and quality of life</a>. The city\u2019s wastewater plant was also expensive, but now that it is operational, residents can swim in the harbour \u2013 something unthinkable in urban waterways elsewhere. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">Danes are consistently </a><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">ranked among the world\u2019s healthiest and happiest people</a>.</p> <p>The municipality also wants to completely phase out combustion engines by electrifying the bus fleet and banning petrol and diesel cars within five years. After that plan ran into opposition from the national government, local environmental NGOs lobbied for a revolutionary new traffic management scheme that hugely decreases the convenience of car use. The \u201cdistribution plan\u201d, which was pioneered in the Belgian town of Ghent, divides the urban centre into a handful of zones and prohibits drivers from going directly from one to another. Instead, they have to go via the suburbs. \u201cIt means there is no such thing as a short drive to the bakery or wherever in this system,\u201d says Jens M\u00fcller, the air quality manager of the Transport &amp; Environment NGO. As a result, walking, cycling and public transport become more appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s the most radical thing you can do apart from creating a no-car zone,\u201d says Juul.</p> <p>Copenhagen is in a group of European cities, including Amsterdam, Paris, London and Oslo, that are trying to set the global pace for air quality improvements. M\u00fcller says London is a leader on ultra-low emission zones, Oslo on promoting use of electric cars, while Paris is exploring radical plans for \u201ca city of 15 minutes\u201d that aims to ensure every resident can get the shops and services they want within a short walk or bicycle ride. Cities in Germany are pioneering pop-up infrastructure and tactical urbanism that allow communities to block roads at certain times for certain events. In Brussels, residents now have a say in when to close roads for children\u2019s parties and barbecues. M\u00fcller says this reduces pollution because people spend more time outside their homes.</p> <p>The foundation, he says, is community activism by previous and current generations. Amsterdam may now be aiming for zero-carbon boats and yet more bikes, but \u2013 like Copenhagen \u2013 the origins of its strong air-quality ambition was the parents\u2019 movement in the 1970s, which campaigned against the number of road traffic accidents with banners demanding: \u201cStop murdering our children.\u201d More recently, Madrid has seen a fierce political contest for control of the streets, with 20,000 people rallying last year to oppose plans by the ruling rightwing coalition to reopen the city centre to cars. The \u201cMadrid Central\u201d zone in the Spanish capital had achieved more <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/people-power-and-courts-fight-first-ever-attempt-scrap-low-emissions-zone\">nitrogen dioxide reductions than any city in Europe</a>. So far, people power has kept the cars out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200/0_125_4171_2503/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melpomenem/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>California (Oakland and Los Angeles)</h2> <p>The importance of grassroots activism has recently been enshrined into law in California, where campaigners have persuaded the government that if it wants to improve air quality it needs to empower low-income BAME neighbourhoods, which are worst affected because they often live closest to pollution sources.</p> <p>California has made impressive strides since the 1980s, when Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose were notorious for a toxic haze that blanketed the city for more than 200 days of the year. These days, thanks to tighter regulations, higher petrol standards and less reliance on coal, there are usually fewer pollutants in the air and about 60 more days of blue skies a year. Several cities have also launched \u201cgreen new deals\u201d. Even the car capital of the world, Los Angeles, is trying to nudge commuters on to an upgraded public transport system.</p> <p>But perhaps the most impressive work is being done at the community level by local activists in hotspots of pollution. The leading light in this initiative is Margaret Gordon, who has spent almost 30 years campaigning for environmental health and social justice in her West Oakland neighbourhood, a part of the San Francisco Bay Area that sits between two highways, a busy port, factories and the proposed site of a coal terminal.</p> <p>She first realised how badly her mostly black and Latino community was affected in 1992 when she started working part-time at a local school where she saw shoeboxes full of asthma inhalers, each with the name tag of a different child. \u201cThat was the start,\u201d she recalls in a Zoom chat interrupted by her coughing. \u201cAfter that, I went to a local meeting to express my righteous outrage about the conditions in the neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon began monitoring the numbers of trucks that passed through on their way to the port. She later received training and funding to measure levels of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that can enter the bloodstream and cause respiratory disease. Even inside her home, the readings were unhealthily high.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf139ca45917963ed9c33f9820babec2e7c952f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf139ca45917963ed9c33f9820babec2e7c952f5/0_0_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Gordon \u2026 has managed to get laws changed to improve the environment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Gordon \u2026 has managed to get laws changed to improve the environment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of WOEIP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She founded the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and worked with scientists, who collected data to prove what she had long believed \u2013 that low-income minority communities are far more likely to suffer the ill effects of air pollution (later including higher vulnerability to Covid-19) than other sectors of society.</p> <p>The pressure has reaped results. The California Air Resources Board ordered the port to take action. There is now stricter regulation of trucks, the port has electrified its facilities and the planned coal terminal has been blocked. Air pollution is 74% lower than in 2008, according to the port. Gordon wants more. \u201cThe windowsills have gone from black to grey. But there is still a long way to go. We still have hotspots.\u201d</p> <p>Her biggest achievement, however, may have been to help draft state law AB617, which passed in 2017 and put local communities at the centre of emissions reductions planning. West Oakland is now one of three Californian neighbourhoods that have drafted their own action plan for dealing with pollution sources. Air quality activists hope this will also address the tendency for wealthy white communities to go low carbon by offloading pollution towards poorer black and Latino areas. Of the two north-south highways in Oakland, it is no coincidence that trucks are banned only on the 580, which passes through a more affluent part of the city. Gordon says the goal is environmental equality.</p> <h2>Mexico City</h2> <p>Among air quality wonks and urban planners, perhaps the greatest buzz of excitement is about Mexico City. The Central American megalopolis was named the world\u2019s most polluted capital in 1992, but it has since managed to improve air quality despite the pressures of an extra 5 million inhabitants.</p> <p>Today it has perhaps the most environmentally savvy mayor in the world. <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/can-environmental-engineer-poised-become-mayor-fix-mexico-city\">Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo</a>, the first woman to hold the office, is an energy scientist who won the Nobel peace prize in 2007 for her work on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p> <p>In a previous stint as the director of the city\u2019s environment department, she oversaw the introduction of the Metrobus, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit\">rapid-transit</a> bus with dedicated lanes. Now she is aiming higher. Last year, she announced a six-year environmental plan, including a 30% cut in air pollution, a 40bn-peso (\u00a31.5bn) modernisation of the metro and a campaign to plant 15m trees. Her government has banned the use of single-use plastic bags and plans to gradually phase out other single-use items, such as straws, cups and balloons.</p> <p>The city\u2019s biggest challenge is traffic. Cars must be off the road for part of the week under the city\u2019s widely replicated Hoy No Circula system, which restricts when vehicles can be on the road based on their number plates. But this has had mixed results because wealthier people simply buy more vehicles to get round the restrictions. The number of vehicles almost doubled between 2006 and 2016, and now account for about 70% of emissions and most nitrogen dioxide pollution in the metropolitan area. Previous administrations have lessened the impact by tightening gasoline standards, expanding monitoring and restricting access to the central corridor in the heart of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78a4ed1d9dbce060922ab5a42a9c9d35918ef639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78a4ed1d9dbce060922ab5a42a9c9d35918ef639/0_458_4016_5020/800.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo \u2026 the world\u2019s most environmentally sensitive mayor?\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo \u2026 the world\u2019s most environmentally sensitive mayor?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Israel Gutierrez/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are still dreadful smog spikes, particularly when forest fires in the surrounding hills add to exhaust fumes. Last year, the air was so unhealthy that the government closed schools, temporarily banned tens of thousands of cars from the road and forced professional football games to be rescheduled.&nbsp;But, overall, there have been long-term gains. Since 1988, ozone is down 46% and the amount of larger PM10 particles has fallen by 74%, according to Marco Balan, an adviser to the city\u2019s air quality general director. \u201cThe view out of my window has improved,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we have a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinbaum wants to go further by raising emissions standards for new vehicles, promoting use of hybrid and electric vehicles and investing more in the metro system, cleaner buses, light railways and cable cars so that people no longer have to rely on informal \u2013 and often dirty and overcrowded \u2013 minivans. Campaigners say a more important step would be to end fuel subsidies. Without that, the cycling scheme, known as EcoBici, will always seem like an afterthought and the Via Verde \u2013 a project to plant vertical gardens on the pillars of elevated roads \u2013 will inevitably be dismissed as window dressing.</p> <p>\u201cMexico City is a stunning example of air quality improvements,\u201d says Chafe. \u201cThey are dealing with it in a holistic way. They know they have many sources and realise it has a huge impact on life expectancy and quality of life. The situation is not perfect, but they have made really impressive progress.\u201d</p> <p>Building on that \u2013 here and elsewhere \u2013 will be the key after lockdown, she says. \u201cWe have seen an improvement in air quality in the past few months. It has been happening for the wrong reasons and in a sad situation. I hope we can now find a way to achieve the same results in a socially fair and feasible way.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to clarify that the quote from Jeppe Juul about pedestrians having more space than bikes only applies to some areas of Copenhagen, not the whole city as an earlier version had implied.</p>",

  "<p>It is hard to find a family that lives and breathes football as much as that of Carlos \u00c1lvarez and his wife, Renae Cu\u00e9llar. Both play professionally: \u00c1lvarez with Landon Donovan\u2019s newly formed San Diego Loyal, in the United Soccer League, the tier below MLS, and Cu\u00e9llar for Tijuana in the thriving Mexican top flight and for Mexico.</p> <p>But the football roots run deeper. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s father, who played in the Mexican second division, made sure there was always a football at the feet of Carlos and his five other children. By the age of four \u00c1lvarez was \u201cplaying-playing, like 11 v 11\u201d. He became the first member of his family to graduate from university, then was selected as the second overall pick in the SuperDraft, by Chivas USA, in 2013.</p> <p>His elder brother is a top coach and one of his three younger brothers, the 17-year-old Efra\u00edn, was described last year by his former LA Galaxy teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic as \u201cby far the biggest talent in the MLS\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/anson-dorrance-we-raise-young-women-to-not-be-competitive-what-the-heck-is-going-on\">Anson Dorrance: 'We raise young women to not be competitive. What the heck is going on?' | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They needed sport in their pocket of east Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s really rare when people come out of my neighbourhood,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cMy parents made sure I played sports and focused on school; that\u2019s how they kept me away from gangs, drugs, prostitution, all the things around my neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>While his parents worked from 4am to 1.30pm cutting chicken off the bone that would go to restaurants such as KFC and Popeyes, \u00c1lvarez and his siblings worked at \u201cstaying out of trouble so they wouldn\u2019t be in trouble. Now they have papers, now they\u2019re full American citizens, but back then they were immigrants. We saw their sacrifices.\u201d</p> <p>A determination to graduate from the University of Connecticut meant the now 29-year-old turned down the opportunity to join MLS sooner.</p> <p>Cu\u00e9llar\u2019s story is not dissimilar. Unlike many young girls, she had a female football role model close to home. \u201cI started playing when I was six and the reason was because my dad\u2019s youngest sister played,\u201d the 29-year-old says. \u201cShe went on to play collegiately and I grew up watching her.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad is a speed and strength trainer, so he would train her and her college teammates on the side to help. So me, at six years old, all I wanted to do was train with my aunt and train with her teammates and be just like her.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually it switched, and her father and aunt were coaching her, pushing her to go further than they were able to. \u201cMy parents had me when they were teenagers, so obviously they just wanted better for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4022133f6079e2b254acfc6dd49f5ab8ddded23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4022133f6079e2b254acfc6dd49f5ab8ddded23/0_110_3288_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Renae Cu\u00e9llar in the semi-final between Mexico and the USA during the Women\u2019s Olympic Qualifying in California in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renae Cu\u00e9llar in the semi-final between Mexico and the USA during the Women\u2019s Olympic Qualifying in California in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Vega/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As \u00c1lvarez played his way through the MLS and USL, Cu\u00e9llar hopped from country to country, playing in the NWSL (scoring the first goal in NWSL history for Kansas City), then in Sweden, South Korea, Germany, Israel and Iceland. Just under two years ago, when she joined Kiryat Gat in Israel, she had to leave behind \u00c1lvarez and their young son, who, fittingly, kicks a ball in the background of our Zoom chat.</p> <p>\u201cHe was about a year and four months old and I had to leave him because I had to go to pre-season while their visas got approved. So Carlos was in his season full-time while taking care of a baby by himself.\u201d</p> <p>Having Romeo has meant making sacrifices. First, Cu\u00e9llar would cry over the unknown: whether she would be able to play again. Then she had to transition from always pressurising herself to be the best to accepting that in this new role, a mother, she would not be perfect. And there were the physical demands of training and breastfeeding, and handling a shift of focus.</p> <p>\u201cI was not used to not being focused in practice. I would catch myself in moments where I was dribbling or I had just finished shooting and I was jogging back and I\u2019m wondering if Romeo is OK.\u201d</p> <p>There are huge benefits in having a spouse who understands your industry, Cu\u00e9llar says. \u201cI enjoy being with somebody that can train with me, somebody that tests me and pushes my buttons when it comes to the game. Once you become a mother there are so many people in the world that may not agree with you playing. I get a lot of: \u2018You should be home with your family.\u2019 That kind of stuff. But I don\u2019t have to explain it to him. I want to train twice today? I want to run? He says: \u2018OK, you go run and I\u2019ll be with Romeo.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/05/chelsea-handed-womens-super-league-title-on-points-per-game-basis\">Chelsea handed Women's Super League title on points-per-game basis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, after years of juggling and travel, the couple play near each other. Their clubs are roughly 32km apart, separated by the Mexico-US border.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it was first created,\u201d Cu\u00e9llar says of the Mexican women\u2019s league, \u201cI was a little bitter about it because Mexican-Americans were not allowed to play in it. I have dual citizenship, but I wasn\u2019t born there. I played for the national team, but I couldn\u2019t play there. I always kept track. I saw that they had great crowds. Now being a part of it is very special to me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great league. I think it\u2019s grown immensely and I hope that it continues to grow for the future of Mexican women\u2019s soccer. There\u2019s a lot of good things behind it, but there also needs to be a lot of growth and a lot more support. I come from humble beginnings, a lot of the girls do, and I think this is a great opportunity for them to have a better life, to help their families and to see that they can achieve very, very big things no matter where they\u2019ve come from or what their circumstances are.\u201d</p> <p>When \u00c1lvarez was told by his agent he had the option of joining San Diego Loyal it was an easy decision to make. \u201cI had a lot of opportunities to go to different places, but just to be around my family, be around my wife, just to see her play, to be around my kid, it meant everything to me. Sometimes you make sacrifices to be next to each other.</p> <p>\u201cThen, getting to be part of a project that Landon Donovan started, a player that I looked up to too, that I played against, that, if you talk about American soccer, you\u2019re talking about Landon Donovan, was huge for me.\u201d</p> <p>Do they notice the differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s football? \u201cThere are huge differences but the similarity is that both come with a lot of sacrifice and dedication,\u201d says \u00c1lvarez.</p> <p>\u201cThere obviously are differences,\u201d adds Cu\u00e9llar. \u201cThe structures of professional teams, the salaries, the coaches, the coaching staff.</p> <p>\u201cI take so much pride in being a woman and being a professional athlete and being able to compete at the level I do. Now I\u2019m a mother to a son, obviously I will never look at it and think they\u2019re getting more than they deserve, you know? I see how hard Carlos works. But I want to strive for better every single day because I hope that one day when we have more kids, a daughter, there are less differences between the men\u2019s and the women\u2019s game.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Soon after Candice Brathwaite gave birth to her daughter Esm\u00e9 \u2013 by Caesarean section, rather than the home birth she dreamed of \u2013 she became convinced something wasn\u2019t right.</p> <p>At night she was sweating through her sheets, which midwives put down to hormonal changes. And the raised lump gathering beneath her C-section wound? Just scar tissue, they said. \u201cIf those who had studied medicine with the hopes of making people feel better were treating me as if nothing was wrong, who was I to argue?\u201d Brathwaite writes, but in the meantime, she gave up on breastfeeding Esm\u00e9 and felt little connection with her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then one night she was awoken by a smell so horrific that it was \u201clike the Hulk had taken a shit and forgotten to flush\u201d. She felt something wet and slimy oozing down her legs and screamed for her husband to call an ambulance. By the time they reached the hospital, she had slipped into septic shock. It took almost a month for her to recover. \u201cAs I finally went back to a baby girl who didn\u2019t know me, I could find no words for how I had been treated or how I was feeling and, not unexpectedly, this went on to impact my mental health.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not the sort of tale you usually find emanating from the picture-perfect&nbsp;mummy influencers on Instagram. But as Brathwaite\u2019s new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/candice-brathwaite/i-am-not-your-baby-mother/9781529406269/\">I Am Not Your Baby Mother</a></em>,&nbsp;makes clear, she is not your average mummy influencer.</p> <p>Since Esm\u00e9\u2019s troubled entry into the world, Brathwaite, 32, a former receptionist and marketing assistant from south London, has built up thousands of followers for her bracingly direct, frequently hilarious Instagram posts featuring Esm\u00e9, six, her son Richard Jr, now two, and her Nigerian husband, Bod\u00e9 (AKA Papa B), in their colourful home in Milton Keynes. The pictures can\u2019t help but highlight how white and middle-class the general image of British motherhood is \u2013 all \u201chorizontal-striped T-shirts and shiny bobs\u201d, as she puts it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAgG7m0pKmG/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

According to the Office for National Statistics, black babies have a 121% increased risk of being stillborn and a 50% increased risk of dying within 28 days of birth compared with white babies. Brathwaite has since received apologies from hospital staff for the long list of \u201cinconsistencies\u201d and dismissive behaviour that \u201cfell far below\u201d the NHS standard, but her experience of feeling&nbsp;\u201cinvisible\u201d or, at best, an aggressive nuisance is clearly not isolated.</p> <p>She remains angry. \u201cMy therapist says that when babies are born, they have these tiny synapses where they\u2019re looking for their mum and if they can\u2019t smell you, they break apart and never go back together, so Esm\u00e9\u2019s always going to pine for me. That makes me so furious, because that separation could have been avoided.\u201d However, she says, she now has a purpose: \u201cI\u2019m at the forefront of a discussion that will hopefully save women\u2019s lives.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Part memoir, part manifesto, Brathwaite\u2019s book was written to help \u201cblack British mothers feel validated and encouraged to take up space\u201d. In recent years, social media stars with handles like \u201cVegan Earth Mother\u201d or \u201cSlummy Mummy\u201d have helped create a \u201cbeige\u201d image of motherhood, Brathwaite says, a land of \u201cglossy women\u201d who seem unnaturally happy to be \u201cspending their days breastfeeding or pureeing organic vegetables into ice-cream trays\u201d.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t just mean beige \u201cin terms of skin tone but in personality, in performance, in content being rolled out\u201d. When she started her blog in 2016, \u201cthere was no other version out there. If you weren\u2019t white and middle-class with this certain set of mummy friends, it just felt like you were sitting on the outskirts looking in.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s title is an attempt to dismantle (not reclaim) the term \u201cbaby-mother\u201d \u2013 which dates back to the 1960s and is often cast upon single black mothers. It\u2019s not simply written through the perspective of a black woman but someone from a working-class background with an unconventional upbringing. Brathwaite is the eldest of three children brought up by her maternal grandparents (who came here from Barbados as part of the Windrush generation), though it was her beloved grandfather \u2013 blinded in one eye after a mugging and no longer able to work \u2013 who did the bulk of the childcare and domestic tasks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9CCEmTp3mb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

So many authors came up to speak and I felt butterflies in my tummy even thinking about being on the other end of this machine. I nudged @livvithomas in the ribs and I said \u2018Mate, one day I\u2019m going to talk about my book at a sales conference.\u2019 And she laughed but agreed, \u2018yes you will.\u2019 And today that dream came true. It is so trippy actually living my dream.

Brathwaite remained close to her father until she was 21, when he died suddenly of the common flu. He had gone to hospital, put up a fight to be seen and then, suffering from sepsis, went into cardiac arrest. All of which makes the Covid-19 crisis particularly sobering for her, she says. \u201cHaving the news pour in on my iPad has made me see that black people really need to work on protecting themselves, because we just see these black bodies piling up.\u201d Her hope is that data around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">BAME deaths during the pandemic</a> will ultimately create a domino effect as health inequalities become impossible to ignore.</p> <p>But <em>I Am Not Your Baby Mother </em>resonates beyond race \u2013 and should strike a chord with any mother alienated by stereotypical images of motherhood. When Brathwaite first became a mother, she was more worried about paying the electricity bill than whether her child\u2019s food was organic. \u201cIf my child is not crying through hunger, I\u2019m winning. The time to fuss is itself a privilege.\u201d</p> <p>While the lack of diversity in images of motherhood might look like carelessness or complacency, you don\u2019t have to scratch too deep to detect uglier impulses. We discuss why Michelle Obama was so successful at projecting an image of black, middle-class motherhood but Meghan Markle has been attacked on everything from how she cradled her bump to how long she leaves her son with a nanny. \u201cWhat spun Britain through a loop was seeing Meghan\u2019s mum at that wedding. It was like: \u2018Woah, that is a black, black lady with locs\u2019\u2026 people are outraged that she has brought a dollop of melanin into the royal family!\u201d</p> <p>Brathwaite has also experienced direct hostility from the mumosphere. Last year it emerged that she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/11/instagram-influencer-clemmie-hooper-secret-account-critics\">among those attacked by</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/11/instagram-influencer-clemmie-hooper-secret-account-critics\"> a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/11/instagram-influencer-clemmie-hooper-secret-account-critics\">secret account</a> created by midwife and reigning queen of the mumfluencers, Clemmie Hooper (AKA Mother of Daughters). Hooper accused Brathwaite \u2013 whom she had previously invited on to her podcast \u2013 of being aggressive and weaponising race (Hooper has since apologised).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"333cece828962b477809b11c485676620d8900b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/333cece828962b477809b11c485676620d8900b5/0_0_472_590/400.jpg\" alt=\"Clemmie Hooper with her partner Simon Hooper, also an Instagram influencer.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clemmie Hooper with her partner Simon Hooper, also an Instagram influencer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat really came at me from behind,\u201d Brathwaite recalls. \u201cI had to tell myself: \u2018Wow girl, get it together, not everyone is your friend.\u2019 But what she decided to do has actually been helpful to me showing people the many things black women are dealing with, not just online but in the office and on the street.\u201d Of all the social media apps, she has most confidence in Instagram, which she insists has the best processes to protect users. </p> <p>Brathwaite and her husband, who works in the tool hire industry, now live in a house bought&nbsp;in part&nbsp;thanks to endorsements&nbsp;and sponsorships. But while she is reluctant to see herself as a role model, the responsibility for speaking to mothers on a lower income clearly plays on her mind. \u201cWhen we tell people to relax their spending at, say, Primark or H&amp;M, we have to be conscious that someone\u2019s \u2018fast fashion\u2019 is someone else\u2019s \u2018high-end\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless she is unabashed about her own material aspirations. She studies idols like Serena Williams, Beyonc\u00e9 and Michelle Obama and is fluent in the language of influence and markets. \u201cI\u2019ve always said: \u2018I\u2019m just here to stack my chips, I don\u2019t know what you guys are on,\u2019\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>\u201cAs this pandemic has shown, anyone\u2019s financial situation can change at any time. Just because we [may attempt to] buy our way out of our blackness, it doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s a solid thing... using the extreme example of police brutality, no racist cop is asking to see your bank balance before they shoot you. No one is saying: \u2018What are you worth, where do you eat, where does your kid go to school?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Financial security for black people may well be \u201ca comfort blanket\u201d, she says, but \u201cit\u2019s a blanket I can\u2019t afford to let go of, because I don\u2019t have anything else\u201d.</p> <p>Still, she insists she doesn\u2019t want to be the product for ever. She has established the platform <a href=\"https://www.makemotherhooddiverse.com/\">Make Motherhood Diverse</a> to shine a light on images of motherhood beyond the white, middle-class and able-bodied \u2013 and her hope is that soon black fatherhood will have its turn in the spotlight. She is \u201cvery purposeful\u201d in showing her husband in a domestic setting, sharing \u201csoft moments\u201d with their son. \u201cI want everyone to know \u2013 but specifically the black community \u2013 I am with a guy who really supports my public career. It\u2019s not something that is typical. Being with him makes me giggle because I realise I\u2019ve just ended up with my grandad \u2013 it\u2019s really, really funny.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A week after we speak, America is in crisis after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>. Brathwaite is posting a lot about racial injustice and has gained 20,000 followers over a weekend. When I catch up with her over email, her anger about black people \u201cbeing killed for nothing more than being black\u201d is tinged with a sense of hope: \u201cI do think it\u2019s a turning point. There is something about this murder that has made the entire world sit up and listen.\u201d When I ask if she will be joining the protests planned in the UK, she says she thinks she will: \u201cIt will be the first time I\u2019ve been out since lockdown but if there is any time that venturing out is worth any kind of risk, it is now.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;<em>I Am Not Your Baby Mother</em>&nbsp;by Candice Brathwaite is published by Quercus (\u00a316.99).

  "<p>Perfection means different things to different people. To some, its pursuit invests life with rich meaning, nobility even, while others merely see a misery-inducing, distinctly Sisyphean, obsession.</p> <p>Most regard it as subjective but, just occasionally, the rarest of moments offer an objective definition. Fifty years ago on Sunday Gordon Banks\u2019s split second of sheer brilliance melded flawlessness, completeness and excellence in one single gravity-defying save from Pel\u00e9.</p> <p>It came on a sun-baked day in the western Mexican city of Guadalajara \u2013 the home of tequila and mariachi music \u2013 during the group stage of the 1970 World Cup. A pace-suffused Brazil beat England 1-0 courtesy of Jairzinho\u2019s winner but the result did not provide the game\u2019s abiding memory.</p> <p>Television footage shows a threadbare pitch and a blonde Englishwoman in the crowd wearing an extraordinary nose guard, presumably to offer protection from the unforgiving UV rays.</p> <p>Then the camera switches to Pel\u00e9 arching his back. It captures his neck muscles flexing as he unleashes the most powerful of goal-bound headers only for Banks to make a mockery of the rules governing physics and human physiology.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IXEc6BAHpY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9IXEc6BAHpY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018He [Pel\u00e9] said it was the best save he\u2019d ever seen\u2019</figcaption> </figure>   <p>By twisting with incredible rapidity in mid-air and extending the fingers of his right hand to scoop the ball from behind, before somehow flicking it upwards, around the goal frame and away for a corner, he elevated goalkeeping to an art form. It may not have been the finest save in history but it is arguably the most memorable.</p> <p>As Pel\u00e9\u2019s forehead connected with Jairzinho\u2019s looping cross the Brazilian screamed: \u201c<em>Gol</em>.\u201d Instead, a glorious collision of physical speed, alacrity of thought and acrobatic reach ensured England\u2019s goalkeeper propelled himself across his goalmouth to produce one of the standout sporting moments of the 20th century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/oct/05/gordon-banks-on-his-famous-pele-save-i-didnt-even-realise-id-made-it\">Gordon Banks on his famous Pel\u00e9 save: 'I didn\u2019t even realise I\u2019d made it'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Banks, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/12/gordon-banks-obituary\" title=\"\">died </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/12/gordon-banks-obituary\" title=\"\">last year aged 81</a>, was already revered for his part in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/05/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-no23-1966\" title=\"\">England\u2019s 1966 World Cup</a> triumph and would confound medical opinion by starring for Fort Lauderdale Strikers in the USA despite having lost sight in one eye following a car crash. But Guadalajara eclipsed everything.</p> <p>At the time everyone was so preoccupied with defending the ensuing corner that the goalkeeper received a rather perfunctory head pat from Alan Mullery and a hair ruffle followed by a bottom pat from Bobby Moore. \u201cYou\u2019re getting old, Banksy,\u201d said England\u2019s captain. \u201cYou used to hold on to them.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, Pel\u00e9 \u2013 the undoubted star of a truly fabulous Brazil side \u2013 never underestimated Banks\u2019s almost incomprehensibly razor-sharp reflexes.</p> <p>\u201cI hit that header exactly where I wanted it and I was ready to celebrate,\u201d he recalled following the death of his one-time nemesis and, later, good friend. \u201cBut then Banks appeared in my sight, like a kind of blue phantom.

He was a kind and warm man who gave so much. I\u2019m glad he saved my header; it was the start of a friendship I\u2019ll always treasure.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/oct/05/gordon-banks-on-his-famous-pele-save-i-didnt-even-realise-id-made-it\" title=\"\">Banks offered Observer Sport Monthly a detailed account of events</a> after the ball bounced down hard into the ground two yards in front of the goalline on a seemingly inexorable journey towards the top corner. \u201cThat save was the best I ever made but, to start with, I didn\u2019t even realise I\u2019d made it at all,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI heard Pel\u00e9 shout \u2018goal\u2019 followed by a massive, almost deafening, roar. Even though I\u2019d got a hand to it, I thought he must have scored.</p> <p>\u201cThen I realised the crowd were cheering for me. Bobby Moore ruffled my hair. I couldn\u2019t believe it. But it was still 0-0 and we had a corner to defend. As I got to my feet I tried to look as nonchalant as possible, as if to say: \u2018I make that sort of save all the time.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThat Brazil team is the greatest to ever play the game and not a day goes by when I don\u2019t get asked about it. I was positioned at the near post, a yard off my line, anticipating the cross. Bobby Moore moved to cover for Cooper, which left Tost\u00e3o unmarked and Rivelino at the far post. Jairzinho ignored them both, imagine that, and picked out Pel\u00e9, who was racing into the box. As he rose to head the ball I started moving across my line.

I managed to get my fingertips to the ball and it went straight up into the air and over the bar.\u201d</p> <p>That redefinition of perfection helped ensure Banks became a six-times recipient of Fifa\u2019s goalkeeper of the year award but his club career was spent in the less starry environs of Chesterfield, Leicester and Stoke. His only two domestic trophies were two League Cups, with Leicester in 1964 and with Stoke in 1972.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption> <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, his seemed a charmed life.

  "<p>Centuries after their deaths and months after their big moment was almost thwarted by Covid-19, a saint, a cross-dressing soldier, an early professional playwright and a group of intrepid nuns are the subject of an exhibition that celebrates the often overlooked female writers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Golden_Age\">Spain\u2019s Golden Age</a>.</p> <p>While the names and works of male authors such as&nbsp;Cervantes, Calder\u00f3n de la Barca and Lope de Vega live on, the same cannot always be said of the women who wrote around the same time.</p> <p>The exhibition in Madrid, staged by the <a href=\"https://www.cervantes.es/default.htm\">Instituto Cervantes</a> and Spain\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bne.es/es/Inicio/index.html\">National Library</a>, aims to redress the imbalance \u2013 or as Luis Garc\u00eda Montero, the institute\u2019s director, puts it, \u201cto help us recover our memory and dynamite the canon\u201d.</p> <p>The show, <a href=\"https://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/sabia/default.htm?en\">Both Wise and Valiant</a>, opened on 5 March but had to shut down and move online when the pandemic hit shortly afterwards. It will now reopen on 18 June and run until September.</p> <p>Its curator, Ana M Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez, hopes it will spark interest in some of the forgotten pathfinders of Spanish letters. A few of the featured writers \u2013 including St Teresa of \u00c1vila and Sister Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (a nun born in Mexico to a Spanish father and a Mexican mother of Spanish descent) \u2013 are still widely read, but many are not.</p> <p>\u201cOver the past few decades, specialists have been discovering these texts by women, but the general public don\u2019t really know much about them and aren\u2019t aware of the richness of these women\u2019s writing,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez, who teaches Spanish literature at the University of Iowa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca3cff617c056f5c0826672dfc2582e80aa18156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3cff617c056f5c0826672dfc2582e80aa18156/0_247_1375_1375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catalina de Erauso, the Nun Lieutenant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catalina de Erauso, the Nun Lieutenant, fled to the Americas and passed herself off as a man.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ART Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around 80% of the writers in the exhibition are women who, paradoxically, found freedom in the cells and cloisters of the convents where they lived as nuns.</p> <p>Freed from their roles as wives, mothers and daughters, says the curator, \u201cthey could devote themselves to reading, writing and rather more intellectual pursuits than society would have permitted them on the outside\u201d.</p> <p>But not all were content to stay put. A document from 1722 recounts the extraordinary story of five Capuchin sisters who wanted to leave Madrid to found a convent in Lima, Peru.</p> <p>Having pleading with their male superiors to be allowed to journey to the New World, they were forced to turn back after being attacked by pirates. Undaunted, they set out again. One of the nuns died from breast cancer en route, but the others made it to Buenos Aires and then to Lima.</p> <p>\u201cThey describe how they were welcomed by the people there \u2013 and talk about their own \u2018otherness\u2019,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cIt really does deserve to be made into a TV series or a film.\u201d</p> <p>More amazing still \u2013 and already the subject of films and plays \u2013 is the true story of Catalina de Erauso, also known as the Nun Lieutenant.</p> <p>\u201cShe was someone we\u2019d doubtless call transgender today,\u201d says the curator. \u201cShe was born a biological woman, went into a convent, escaped from it and ended up fleeing to the Americas. Once there, she passes herself off not just as a man but as a Spanish imperial soldier. She fights and lives as a man and has affairs with women.\u201d</p> <p>And then there is Ana Caro, a playwright who was paid for her work in Madrid and Seville. One of the documents in the exhibition records a payment made to her in 1638 \u2013 two years before Aphra Behn, commonly agreed to be the first female professional English playwright, is thought to have been born.</p> <p>Like Calder\u00f3n and Lope de Vega, Caro explored the Golden Age staple of lost honour. But in her self-explanatory play <em>Courage, Betrayal and A Woman Scorned</em>, the protagonist is anything but a passive bystander when it comes to her own honour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c1c4697133dd89652b61aab5e89c87e6aa5a32d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c1c4697133dd89652b61aab5e89c87e6aa5a32d/0_0_3592_2584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A page of text from The Foundation of the Capuchin Monastery of Jesus, Mary and Joseph in Lima, which tells the story of the journey that five nuns made to found a convent in Peru (1722).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Foundation of the Capuchin Monastery of Jesus, Mary and Joseph in Lima, which tells the story of the journey that five nuns from a Madrid convent made to found a new convent in Peru (1722).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Library of Spain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe dresses as a man and crosses Europe to defend her rights and to find her place in society after her reputation\u2019s been taken from her,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p>The texts still resonate, the curator says, as women continue to be victims of violence and are still judged over their bodies and what they do with them. </p> <p>The exhibition also reveals the presence of women at the other end of the literary production chain: while many 16th- and 17th-century female printers inherited the business from their husbands and fathers, some sent out editions under their own names, and refused to sign themselves as widows or daughters.</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez believes recognition of these women and the \u201calmost subversive\u201d fact of their writing is long overdue.

  "<p>One of the more pertinent statements made during this past extraordinary week appeared in one of the last places I would have thought to look \u2013 in the pages of <em>Vogue</em>, not a publication I instinctively turn to at a moment of profound political tension.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRacism is a global issue. Racism is a British issue. It is not one that is merely confined to the United States \u2013 it is everywhere, and it is systemic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/edward-enninful-racism\">wrote</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/edward-enninful\">Edward Enninful</a>, the editor-in-chief of the magazine\u2019s British edition. The ubiquity of racism has been brought to stark and sudden attention by the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> and by the unprecedented wave of protests, demonstrations and rioting that followed.</p> <p>Filmed by many witnesses and now viewed millions of times, the killing of Floyd by a Minnesota policeman, a 21st-century lynching, is so sickening a crime that the revulsion it has induced has become a global phenomenon.</p> <p>The demonstrators and activists who have taken to the streets have, however, been motivated by more than revulsion. They have also been stirred to action by acknowledging a fundamental truth \u2013 that the killing of Floyd has to be understood as a symptom of systemic racism. By building their campaign around that reality they have promoted radical and challenging conversations \u2013 in countries on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 about the nature of racism and the actions that people of all races can take in eliminating it. These are conversations that we have needed for a very long time.</p> <p>Led by young people, many of them inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, and involving people of all ethnicities, the protests have morphed into a worldwide anti-racist movement. No longer is this moment solely about police violence nor is it limited to America. Both online and on the streets it is calling out racism, wherever it exists and in whatever forms it is found. In both the US and in Europe, people are asking, tentatively, if this might be a defining moment of change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9daf1e6546231cf57669c8a5976a9c05849b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9daf1e6546231cf57669c8a5976a9c05849b35/0_120_5399_3241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The British actor John Boyega speaks at a Black Lives Matter protest in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The British actor John Boyega speaks to the crowd during a Black Lives Matter protest in Hyde Park on 3 June 2020 in London, England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet in the immediate aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death there was little reason to imagine anything would be any different this time around. For African Americans, one of the most appalling aspects of Floyd\u2019s murder was that they had seen it all before. The same story with the same outcome, all that changed was the name of the victim \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/breonna-taylors-death-black-women-killed-police-encounters/story?id=71057133\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sandra-bland\">Sandra Bland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice\">Tamir Rice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/walter-scott-shooting\">Walter Scott</a>.</p> <p>For many black Britons, Floyd\u2019s death stirred memories of another list of names, those of the members of their community killed or rendered disabled in similar circumstances at the hands of the British police or immigration officers. On Tuesday, the <a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/blog/2020/6/1/a-statement-from-bca-our-lives-matter-its-time-for-change\">Black Cultural Archives</a> in Brixton, south London \u2013 the closest thing we have in this country to a museum to the black British experience \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bcaheritage\">tweeted</a> the names and the photographs of some of them \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\">Mark Duggan</a>, Sheku Bayoh, Sean Rigg, Sarah Reed, Cherry Groce, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51587151\">Leon Briggs</a>, Christopher Alder, Brian Douglas.</p> <p>Yet almost instantly a predictable chorus of voices, emanating from predictable corners of British public life, rose up to dismiss the whole thing as an irrelevance. Using a familiar playbook, they accused those black Britons who see reflections of their own situation in the experiences of African Americans of making false comparisons.</p> <p>The US situation is unique in both its depth and ferocity, they say, so that no parallels can be drawn with the situation in Britain. The smoke-and-mirrors aspect of this argument is that it attempts to focus attention solely on police violence, rather than the racism that inspired it. Those who make it usually point to the ubiquity of firearms in US law enforcement, as proof that the US reality is beyond meaningful comparison. But firearms had nothing to do with the killing of George Floyd. Neither were they a factor in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32400497\">Freddie Gray</a> or the sidewalk killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>, who, like Floyd, pleaded for his life, saying 11 times to the officers who pinned him down: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, the same words Floyd used in his final moments. Nor were guns involved in many of the cases when black people have <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\">died in custody or during arrest</a> in Britain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Excusing or downplaying British racism with comparisons to the US is a bad habit with a long history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When black Britons draw parallels between their experiences and those of African Americans, they are not suggesting that those experiences are identical. Few people would deny that in many respects life is better for non-white people in the UK than in the US. The problem is that it is not as \u201cbetter\u201d as some like to believe. Black men are stopped and searched at nine times the rate of white men. Black people make up 3% of the population of England and Wales but account for 12% of the prison population and not since 1971 have British police officers been prosecuted for the killing of a black man, and even then they were charged with the lesser crime of manslaughter and that charge was later dropped.</p> <p>To say that the racism that infects parts of our police force and criminal justice system is less virulent than that which poisons the lives of 40 million African Americans is not much of a boast. Is that really the extent of our ambition \u2013 to be a somewhat less racist nation than one led by a man who describes white nationalists and members of the Ku Klux Klan as \u201cvery fine people\u201d? Surely we who dwell in what the actor Laurence Fox recently assured us is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/18/question-time-clash-lecturer-tells-of-hate-mail\">the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe</a>\u201d have higher hopes?</p> <p>Excusing or downplaying British racism with comparisons to the US is a bad habit with a long history. It began in 1807, with the abolition of the slave trade and picked up steam three decades later with the end of British slavery, twin events that marked the beginning of 200 years of moral posturing and historical amnesia. The Victorian readers who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/22/review-harriet-beecher-stowe-uncle-toms-cabin\">rightly wept</a> over <em>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin</em>, for example, conveniently forgot which nation had carried his ancestors into slavery and didn\u2019t dwell on the fact that most of the cotton produced by American slaves like him was shipped to Liverpool.</p> <p>For two centuries, we have deployed American racism as a distraction. It\u2019s as if we find it easier to recognise American forms of racism than we do our own&nbsp;home-grown varieties. Convenient, as pointing fingers is always more comforting than looking in the mirror.</p> <p>\u2022 David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster</p>",

  "<p>The reaction of many of those in leadership positions in the Church of England to the killing of George Floyd has been to ask BAME people about their experience, not only in the United States but also in Britain.</p> <p>Social media posts with the hashtag #blacklivesmatter have been copious, as have been the searches for people \u201cwho can speak about race and the UK church\u201d with sensitive rejoinders about \u201cwhite people putting pressure on black people to tell us how to solve racism for us\u201d.</p> <p>All of this comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/02/john-sentamu-i-would-join-george-floyd-protests\">Dr John Sentamu</a> prepares to step down from his post as archbishop of York. His retirement comes at a time when the Church of England has been talking about making great strides in the appointments of senior BAME leaders. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/17/stephen-cottrell-appointed-archbishop-of-york\">from tomorrow</a>, for the first time in over a quarter of a century, there will be no black or minority ethnic diocesan bishop serving in the Church of England. When diocesan bishops next meet and discuss their response to the events in America, the disproportionate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">impact of Covid-19</a> on BAME communities and on poor people in urban communities, there will be no one of colour with an equal voice among them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The questions about race and racism in the church extend far beyond its leadership. Yet when the Conservative party, hitherto unknown for racially progressive leadership, appoints a BAME man and a BAME woman to two of the four highest offices of state and appoints others to the cabinet, the one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic.</p> <p>A glance at the most senior level of leadership in the Church of England reveals an alarmingly retrograde trend. Michael Nazir-Ali, who served as the bishop of Rochester, was the church\u2019s first BAME diocesan bishop when he was appointed in 1994. Following Sentamu\u2019s appointment as bishop of Birmingham in 2002, the church enjoyed the zenith of its ethnic diversity in leadership with two senior bishops until Nazir-Ali\u2019s retirement in 2009. For the last decade, Sentamu has alone represented that diversity.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/beaten-in-uganda-abused-in-the-uk-john-sentamus-long-struggle-against-injustice\">Beaten in Uganda, abused in the UK: John Sentamu\u2019s long struggle against injustice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But leadership in the church is about more than bishops.

There are no BAME members of HTB\u2019s senior clergy or senior leadership team. None of their churches across London and the UK is led by BAME clergy. According to New Wine\u2019s website, there are no BAME clergy or lay leaders in its 30-strong team of national directors, regional directors and heads of ministry.</p> <p>But this failure is not confined to the church\u2019s evangelical wing. In leading Catholic organisations the picture is the same. The newest organisation, <a href=\"http://46.32.240.47/sodalityofmary.co.uk/about-us/\">the Sodality of Mary Mother of Priests</a>, promotes itself on social media with a picture of a group with an image of 25 priests gathered around an altar \u2013 all of whom are white. More established national Catholic networks paint a similar picture. The leadership of the <a href=\"https://www.sswsh.com/\">Society of Saint Wilfrid and Hilda</a> is exclusively white, as is the leadership of Forward in Faith in its executive committee. If the old dictum that \u201cyou need to see it to be it\u201d is applied to the church\u2019s leadership, that offers little hope to young BAME church members for their inclusion or participation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Try looking for BAME appointments in other senior roles within the church. Diocesan secretaries? None. Chairs of diocesan boards of finance? None. Principals of theological colleges? None.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last week, Robin Ward, the principal of one of the church\u2019s training institutions, <a href=\"https://premierchristian.news/en/news/article/archbishop-of-york-in-twitter-spat-over-social-distancing-at-black-lives-matter-protests\">took to Twitter</a> to call out the archbishop of York for supporting the Black Lives Matter rally in Hyde Park. Pitching his desire to see churches open their doors again against the tragedy of the death of George Floyd highlighted the lack of understanding or empathy at work in parts of the higher echelons of the church.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the picture is not entirely bleak. In recent years, there has been much rejoicing at the appointment of women and men as assistant or suffragan bishops in the Church of England. <a href=\"https://canterburydiocese.org/our-life/news-events/news/rose-hudson-wilkin-named-bishop-of-dover.php\">Rose Hudson-Wilkin as bishop of Dover</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chelmsford.anglican.org/area/bradwell\">John Perumbalath as the bishop of Bradwell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/14-july/news/uk/refugee-from-iran-to-be-first-bishop-of-loughborough\">Guli Francis-Dehqani</a> as bishop of Loughborough and <a href=\"https://staugustinescollege.ac.uk/staff/karowei-dorgu/\">Karowei Dorgu</a> as bishop of Woolwich joined bishop <a href=\"https://www.anglicancommunion.org/structures/member-churches/member-church/diocese/position.aspx?church=england&amp;dio=diocese-in-europe&amp;pos=suffragan-bishop-of-the-diocese-in-europe&amp;posID=4286\">David Hamid</a> from the diocese of Europe.</p> <p>Yet if we were add up all of the Church of England\u2019s serving BAME bishops, out of more than 100 we would still be counting on one hand.&nbsp;</p> <p>For some, the appointment of Sentamu as archbishop of York was going to mean that the issue of race and racism in the Church of England could now be dismissed. That kind of aspiration is simplistic. After all, after eight years of the Obama presidency in the United States, when one hoped that historical progress was being made, we are confronted with the opposite.</p> <p>In a church that rightly proclaims that the gifts of the holy spirit are for all people, from every race and nation, why does the Church of England present such a contradictory picture?</p> <p>\u2022 Arun Arora is vicar of St Nics Durham</p> <p>\u2022 This article was co-written by Eileen Harrop, Remi Ole and Shemil Matthew</p>",

I wonder how the gap in their education is going to present itself and what has happened to them over the past 10 weeks. But my biggest anxiety is: is this going to work? Are we going to be able to keep everybody safe? Will all the children manage to stay in one \u201cbubble\u201d throughout the week?</p> <p>At the same time, I\u2019m feeling very, very excited. I always form such a strong connection to the children I teach and the thought that keeps going through my mind is: I\u2019m going to see some of them again. And the moment that I do, I feel overwhelmed with emotion. It was such a beautiful sunny day, and when each child came round the corner and we saw each other\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Those were moments of complete and utter joy.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>I feel much less anxious today. The steps my leadership team has put in place have been very successful. The children may be only five or six years old, but they have learned to line up two metres apart, put hand gel on when they arrive and sit at individual desks spread out around the room. Normally, I teach the children through play, we don\u2019t have formal desks at all. But they are now taking pride in their desks and saying \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep it tidy\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout the week, the children seem fully aware of the virus and what\u2019s been happening. Today, when we speak about the continent of Asia, straightaway one of the children says: \u201cThat\u2019s where the coronavirus comes from.\u201d My teaching assistant and I look at each other. Asia has such a rich culture and history. For a child to immediately think of that\u2026 This is how the real world is imprinting itself on our young children.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>The children are learning about Saint George, so I get them to describe and draw their own dragons.</p> <p>Normally, I teach a mixed class of 30 Year 1 and Year 2 pupils, but only nine of them have come into school this week. We are all in one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/19/distanced-drop-offs-and-protective-bubbles-englands-new-school-rules\">\u201cbubble\u201d</a> together. My teaching assistant supervises them when I have my lunch or a break, and vice versa, so no other adult ever enters our bubble.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to keep your distance from a small child \u2013 sometimes they just want to come up to you and hold your hand. My biggest concern is to keep the children\u2019s anxieties to a minimum. That comes first, for me, so I am prepared to let them get a bit close.</p> <p>After a socially distanced ice-cream on the school playing field with other staff members, I hear on the news the death toll is rising again. My mother calls me to say she wouldn\u2019t have sent her child back to school this week \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have a choice. I find myself hoping, beyond anything, that going back was the right decision.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>We play socially distanced golf this morning. It\u2019s not a sport I\u2019ve taught before, it\u2019s not on our normal curriculum but it was fantastic. When the children\u2019s balls land in the \u201cpond\u201d I have created from a big water tray, they have to whack them out of the water \u2013 and they can\u2019t stop laughing.</p> <p>I can tell one little boy is missing his best friend though. Usually, they\u2019re inseparable \u2013 but his friend isn\u2019t coming in, so he seems a bit lost. I try my best to help. I miss the other children in the class, too.</p> <p>From the news that evening, I learn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">face masks will soon be compulsory on public transport</a>. Yet the government is happy for teachers to be confined in classrooms with up to 15 children all day long. That was interesting.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Today the children re-enact the Roman invasion of the hometown of Boudica, the warrior queen. Normally, we dedicate a whole term to a single topic or theme, but this week I\u2019ve been trying to spark their curiosity about learning again. There are no end of year assessments, like there usually are, so I can use this time to really explore and fill the different gaps in their knowledge.</p> <p>It takes a lot of energy to teach young children and when I leave, I am tired. I want to collapse on the sofa. But I have been back in the classroom, where I should be, seeing children smile again and having an impact on their learning. And that has felt incredible.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Passport details<br></strong>Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga. Born 1571 of Japanese imperial descent; baptised into the Catholic church as&nbsp;Francisco Felipe Faxicura in Spain, 1615.</p> <p><strong>Claim to fame<br></strong>In 1613, seven years before the Mayflower headed to the New World, Hasekura set sail from the small Japanese port of Tsukinoura, crossed the Pacific, travelled overland through Mexico, then sailed all the way to Europe.&nbsp;He was accompanied by about 20 fellow countrymen \u2013 in all likelihood, the first Japanese to cross the Atlantic.&nbsp;They visited Seville, were received by the King of Spain, popped briefly to France, and travelled to Rome for an audience with the pope in 1615.&nbsp;The purpose of Hasekura\u2019s embassy seems to have been to establish cultural and trading links with Europe.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Supporting documentation<br></strong>When he left Japan, Hasekura began a journal about his experiences. Unfortunately, this was lost or destroyed on his return.&nbsp;There are, however,&nbsp;records of his visit in European archives. It was the discovery of these in the 19th century that reignited Japanese interest in their forgotten emissary.&nbsp;Some of the historical evidence is collected in an appendix to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\">Shusaku Endo</a>\u2019s excellent 1982 novel about Hasekura\u2019s journey, The Samurai<em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Distinguishing marks<br></strong>Hasekura was painted during his visit to Rome by the artist Claude Deruet.&nbsp;It shows him wearing a beautiful silk outfit embroidered with animals and grasses, but the eye is drawn to a pair of swords at his waist, symbols of his status as a samurai.</p> <p><strong>Last sighted<br></strong>Hasekura\u2019s trip was astonishingly badly timed.&nbsp;When he returned to Japan in 1620, having been baptised into the Catholic church, the country had begun to persecute Christians and was about to retreat into <em><a href=\"https://www.kcpinternational.com/2014/10/the-sakoku-years-of-japan/\">sakoku</a></em>,&nbsp;the centuries-long policy of isolation that weirdly foreshadowed Brexit.&nbsp;With Japanese Euroscepticism triumphant, Hasekura was persona non grata.&nbsp;He vanishes from history.&nbsp;One hint of his fate is the fact that in 1640 his son was forced to disembowel himself because of alleged sympathies towards the illegal Christian religion.</p> <p><strong>Intrepidness rating<br></strong>It\u2019s not so much that Hasekura was intrepid \u2013 though he clearly was \u2013 but that his journey helps correct the Eurocentric bias of many assumptions about explorers.&nbsp;Whatever his aims, the mind boggles at the thought of armed samurai wandering around the Europe of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/elgreco\">El Greco</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/miguelcervantes\">Cervantes</a>: <strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Sonia Shah\u2019s last two books <em>Pandemic</em>, published in 2016, and <em>The Fever</em>, published in 2010, introduced her as a storyteller in a novel genre: travel books that went in search of the spread of disease - cholera in the former, malaria in the latter. That literature of track and trace, part detective story, part reportage, took Shah to remote corners of the world and to distant grid references of history. Her books were also prescient case studies of the way that human progress has been shaped by its love-hate relationship with microbes \u2013 how disease has caused empires to rise and fall and economies to stutter and implode.&nbsp;</p> <p>This book \u2013 a wandering narrative about why people wander \u2013 is likely to prove equally prophetic in the coming months and years, since it asks two questions that are already shaping our geopolitics: what causes human beings to migrate? And is such mass movement beneficial to more settled communities and nations?&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cnext great migration\u201d has been predicted by many \u2013 and feared by some \u2013&nbsp;ever since the end of the cold war.&nbsp;The national security expert <a href=\"https://www.robertdkaplan.com/\">Robert D</a><a href=\"https://www.robertdkaplan.com/\"> Kaplan</a> described it in a 1994 <em>Atlantic</em> magazine article as \u201cthe coming anarchy\u201d \u2013 the binary superpowers had held borders mostly in check, now people would start to move. \u201cThere would likely be 50 million on the move by 2020, experts at the United Nations University projected. Two hundred million by 2050, the environmental security analyst Norman Myers announced. One billion! the NGO Christian Aid projected.\u201d One result of those alarmist predictions had been the populist politics that has emerged with a single purpose in mind: how to make those people stay still. \u201cEnd freedom of movement!\u201d; \u201cbuild the wall!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"http://soniashah.com/\">Shah</a> begins her history with a series of observations that become parables from the natural world. The first concerns the habits and behaviour of the checkerspot butterfly. The checkerspot, most abundant on the west coast of America, is not a powerful creature. It flies very low to the ground and only lives for 10 days. Because of its sensitivity to changes in habitat and environment, it also proved one of the first bellwethers of climate change. A celebrated paper in <em>Nature</em> in 1996 showed that in response to warming temperatures the edges of the population of checkerspots were moving northwards at a rate of 20km per decade. Shah joined the butterfly hunters marking that progress and along the way found evidence that myriad other species are also checking out of familiar territories: Atlantic cod, for example, are moving at a rate of 200km a decade toward the cooler poles.</p> <p>Shah confesses to a certain kinship with those migrations. Her parents \u2013 alone among their siblings \u2013 moved from India 50 years ago to fulfil a need for doctors in New York City, in the first wave of legal migration from the subcontinent. That migration instilled in Shah \u201can acute feeling of being somehow out of place\u201d; despite having been born American, \u201cI didn\u2019t consider myself as being \u2018from\u2019 that place, even though I\u2019d borne both of my children there\u201d. For a few years, she and her husband left to live in Australia and became doubly \u201calien\u201d. These feelings prompted questions in Shah: where did that concept of home originate? And was that a learned or an innate understanding?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nigel Farage\u2019s efforts to police the English Channel are about as likely to succeed as those of King Canute</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her compulsive investigation into these questions becomes a political history of the human urge to move from one place to another. It begins with the \u201cmitochondrial Eve\u201d identified as the African ancestor of all human societies \u2013 the prime mover of a species hardwired to migrate \u2013 and ends in the determined and futile efforts of contemporary politicians to deny that instinct in individual refugees with nowhere to go except somewhere else.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shah identifies the emergence of biological taxonomy, the naming of things, as the historical moment when we decided that nature, which had never stopped moving and evolving, was actually fixed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/wikipedia-influence-list-carl-linnaeus\">Carl Linnaeus</a>, \u201cthe sex-crazed Swedish taxonomist\u201d, becomes the founding father of a political principle of nativism that can be summed up simply: \u201cWe belong here. They belong there.\u201d She shows how this enlightenment control freakery gave rise not only to eugenics and \u201crace science\u201d but also to the underpinnings of fascism. Heinrich Himmler, in addition to masterminding the genocide of millions, issued rules for landscape design: \u201cThe head of the Reich central office for \u2018Vegetation Mapping\u2019 called the delicate flowering herb <em>Impatiens parviflora</em> a \u2018Mongolian invader\u2019 and recommended its extermination.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8724911c84b266d7e970e0fd988e941556b3feef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8724911c84b266d7e970e0fd988e941556b3feef/0_0_4016_6016/668.jpg\" alt=\"Sonia Shah: \u2018asks the questions that are already shaping our geopolitics\u2019\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonia Shah: \u2018asks the questions that are already shaping our geopolitics\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having established this history, Shah unpicks its pernicious effects on contemporary false narratives about immigration and the re-emergence of supremacist racial rhetoric in the political mainstream. It is only two decades since Bill Clinton stood on the White House steps and announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jun/26/genetics13\">the sequencing of the human genome</a>, which offered incontrovertible proof that we not only have infinitely more in common than that which divides us \u2013 \u201cThe sequencers had found [that] a paltry 0.1% of the 3bn nucleotides strung together on our strands of DNA differed from any one person to the next\u201d \u2013 but that encoded in our DNA was the age-old urge to mix and move about.</p> <p>Towards the end of this fascinating study, Shah travels to some of the frontlines of the denial of that instinct. She meets the gravediggers of the Greek island of Lesbos, who bury the migrants who wash up on their shores, many of them children, in unmarked graves. She has no easy answers, except to argue that our biology and our history tell us a very different story to our politicians. Nigel Farage\u2019s efforts to police the English Channel are about as likely to succeed as those of King Canute. \u201cLife is on the move, today as in the past,\u201d Shah insists. \u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve suppressed the fact of the migration instinct, demonising it as a harbinger of terror. We\u2019ve constructed a story about ourselves, our history, our bodies, and the natural world around us in which migration is the anomaly. It\u2019s an illusion. And once it falls, the entire world shifts.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Next Great Migration: The Story of Movement on a Changing Planet</em> by Sonia Shah is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a314.99).

These are just three examples of ordinary people who have responded in extraordinary ways. Their actions speak of selflessness, defiance and bravery in the face of the invisible threat that hovers around us in the very air that we breathe. But they also provide us with glimpses of the immense human cost of the pandemic, the great well of loss, fear, sadness and grief beneath the mounting statistics.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Britain, as I write, 37,000 people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/coronavirus-uk-map-the-latest-deaths-and-confirmed-cases-near-you\">lost their lives</a> to the Covid-19 virus, while 267,000 have experienced and survived the terrible uncertainty of infection. As a fragile normality slowly returns, many mental health experts are asking the inevitable questions: what will be the long-term emotional and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">psychological cost</a> of such a sudden and seismic disruption of our way of life?</p> <p>\u201cHow the outside impacts on the inside is something that people like me think about all the time,\u201d says psychotherapist and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/susie-orbach\">Susie Orbach</a>. \u201cBut now we are seeing it on a grand scale. The pandemic has been a prolonged assault from outside on our community. The state of uncertainty and unsafety it has created is new and utterly unfamiliar. Unless you are a refugee who has risked their life to get here, or a survivor of childhood abuse that could not be escaped, there is simply nothing to compare it to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eceac7aaf1ea9f3150268c9a61a1682a7ad772fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eceac7aaf1ea9f3150268c9a61a1682a7ad772fe/0_0_1142_1252/912.jpg\" alt=\"Rose \u2018Billy\u2019 Mitchell\" width=\"912\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose \u2018Billy\u2019 Mitchell, who died in a nursing home in London.

Leaving aside the probability of another spike, the aftershock of the pandemic is likely to last a long time and leave yet more casualties in its wake.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jo Stubley, a consultant psychiatrist and clinical psychoanalyst at the Tavistock and Portman clinic in London, is a specialist in trauma who has worked with survivors of the London terrorist attacks and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell Tower</a> disaster. Those kinds of emergencies, she explains, are classed as \u201csingle events that occur within a limited time-frame and affect a defined population\u201d. A global pandemic does not fit that model.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For those with a history of trauma, it has been a particularly difficult time</p> <footer> <cite>Susie Orbach</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe word most often used is \u2018unprecedented\u2019,\u201d she says, \u201cand it looks increasingly likely that the long-term consequences will also be unprecedented in scale. Given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health\">mental health services</a> have been starved of resources for years, one can only imagine the impact that a deep recession will have on an already beleaguered sector. So there is a lot of concern among health care professionals like myself about what will happen next.\u201d</p> <p>It is in the coming months and even years, then, that the psychological effects of the pandemic will become most apparent. \u201cTrauma occurs when you are overwhelmed by an event that you cannot process,\u201d says Julia Samuel, grief counsellor and bestselling author, whose latest book is titled <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/grief-works-stories-life-death-and-surviving-review-julia-samuel\">Grief Works: Stories of Life, Death and Surviving</a></em>. \u201cWhile the crisis is happening, you are in it and everything is uncertain and unpredictable. You don\u2019t have the emotional freedom to allow yourself to process the trauma, so it is held in the body. The most common reaction is to shut down and just exist somehow. It is only when the external world becomes more safe and predictable again that people may feel able to reach out for support.\u201d</p> <p>Those most at risk of suffering post-traumatic stress are the frontline medical staff who, in the first chaotic weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, may have felt overwhelmed&nbsp;by the dramatically increased levels of patient suffering and deaths, as well as at risk from infection from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/medical-staff-face-weeks-without-protective-gowns\">inadequate PPE</a> and anxious about bringing the virus home with them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Studies have also shown that, in ordinary times,&nbsp;patients who have spent time in intensive care are at a 20% increased risk of developing PTSD. \u201cAlready with some of the support initiatives that have been put in place, we are seeing survivors of Covid-19 showing post-traumatic symptoms,\u201d says Stubley. She explains that there is an accepted timeline for the&nbsp;treatment of post-traumatic stress. \u201cTime zero is the moment the trauma itself ends. In the first months or so afterwards, around 90% of those who experienced trauma will have PTS symptoms including feeling edgy or constantly on guard, sleeplessness, irritability and acute anxiousness. The Nice [National Institute for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a>&nbsp;and Care Excellence] guidelines state that we should not treat people in that first month as these symptoms can often pass.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1/0_174_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital in east Lancashire. \u2018Nurses and doctors will suddenly be thinking: \u2018My God!

The third stage, PTSD, which will affect around 10% of those who have experienced a traumatic event, is a kind of prolonged shutdown. \u201cPeople&nbsp;dissociate from their feelings, go numb,\u201d says Stubley. \u201cIt can last for years and years.\u201d</p> <p>Her main concern, though, is for those already in the mental health system, for whom lockdown has already had a major impact. It is an anxiety shared by many therapists, who have been unable to see their patients face to face throughout the lockdown period, instead hosting online sessions.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac1373921e9634bcb31f010605820acb262eda9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1373921e9634bcb31f010605820acb262eda9f/0_0_3142_4028/780.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Jacob Stead of a coronavirus wrecking ball\" width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Jacob Stead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor those with a history of trauma,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cit has been a particularly difficult time, not just because of the loneliness and isolation, but because it may also have re-stimulated past traumas. There is so much about the pandemic that is disturbing and distressing on so many levels.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal College of Surgeons recently carried out research into the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on healthcare workers, gathering personal testimonies from nurses and doctors on the frontline. Many reported experiencing increased levels of anxiety, stress, depression as well as panic attacks and bouts of guilt about the amount of people who have died. \u201cI can\u2019t see how I can keep doing this...\u201d said one. \u201cI really wish I wasn\u2019t a doctor,\u201d said another.&nbsp;</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Guardian</em>, lead researcher and NHS doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-mental-health-storm-nhs-workers\">Ankur Khajuria</a> noted that even before the pandemic around 50% of doctors and 40% of nurses were suffering from stress-related psychiatric illness. \u201cA perfect storm is gathering,\u201d he warned.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lucy Warner is chief executive of NHS Practitioner Health, a confidential service that treats doctors with mental health issues. They expect to treat around 3,500 doctors a year. When I spoke to her a few weeks ago, she said they had already treated about a third of that annual number in the preceding few weeks \u2013 \u201cmostly through online spaces where people can connect, talk to each other, share their feelings and reflect.\u201d</p> <p>In the early stage of the pandemic, she says, \u201cthere was a lot of anticipatory anxiety. It was new and people didn\u2019t really know what was happening or how long it would go on, but they knew it was frightening.\u201d As the weeks have passed in long shifts and rising numbers of the sick and the dead, that gave way to \u201ca lot of emotional fatigue, a kind of mental and physical exhaustion. It was becoming a toil, it was becoming difficult for doctors to go on while not knowing how the pandemic would play out.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the last months, that state of mental and physical fatigue has for many become the default mode. \u201cIn a way, it no longer feels like a break with the norm,\u201d says Warner, \u201cit just feels normal.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a long game.

We are seeing the beginnings of a surge in mental health issues among frontline staff, but over the next year or more we are going to see a lot of people who thought they were OK suddenly realising that they are not. There will be some nurses and doctors suddenly thinking: \u2018My God! What did I go through?\u2019 That\u2019s when we may have to deal with a surge in PTSD symptoms, and those people will need individual support but also support on an organisational level.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>While the government and some media were quick to apply the language of wartime to the pandemic \u2013 heroic British frontline warriors battling an invisible enemy \u2013&nbsp;Jo Stubley told me of her and her colleagues\u2019 discomfort at that kind of distracting rhetoric. \u201cThe NHS is not the military,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cand nurses are not soldiers.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Like several others I spoke to, Warner was also uncomfortable with what she called \u201cthe hero narrative\u201d that has taken hold of the public imagination during the long weeks of lockdown. \u201cIt is unhelpful in some ways because you don\u2019t want doctors and nurses to feel they are superheroes, who have to pat themselves on the back when they are on the line and not sleeping or even having time for a pee. What can tend to get overlooked is that they are human beings who are entitled to a rest as much as we all are. They are ordinary people doing their very best, but we need them to be well to do their jobs well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608/0_0_6366_4244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response to the emergency of the last few months, several psychotherapists have set up online drop-in support groups for NHS staff, who may be feeling overwhelmed or emotionally exhausted. I spoke to one who, with a colleague, has created \u201ca support group for clinical staff\u201d in London. She asked for anonymity.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing to stress is that it is drop-in support, not psychotherapy \u2013 the midst of a crisis is not the time to start psychotherapy for clinical staff. What they need is a safe space to come together, share their thoughts and anxieties and listen to others experiencing similar challenges. To this end, everyone uses first names only and they do not have to say where they work. They can also choose to be seen on a screen or not.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the take-up rate has been low and almost all those who have used the service are doctors rather than nurses. \u201cI think there are various reasons for that,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, they are in it, and when they get home, they are utterly exhausted. Also, they are perhaps not aware of what help has been made available to NHS staff, even though there is actually a lot of help out there.\u201d</p> <p>The other more positive reason is that they may already be receiving support from their fellow workers, from the strength of being part of a team that is responding well in extremely difficult circumstances. \u201cThe way the nursing profession works is that you tend to get on with it,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cYou are to a degree encouraged to feel that way, so even when the normal rules don\u2019t apply there is the sense that this is what you have been trained for. It\u2019s amazing in many ways, but it means that everybody seems to be coping on the surface, while underneath they may well be struggling.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244/0_206_4687_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first chaotic weeks of the Covid pandemic, many nurses and doctors felt not just overwhelmed, but threatened and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/worrying-event-deaths-of-nhs-doctors-from-covid-19-stark-reminder-of-pandemic\">unsafe</a>. There were serious issues over the lack of adequate PPE,&nbsp;leading to increased anxiety about contracting the virus and passing it on to family members. Both the workplace and the home thus became places that were unsafe and uncertain.&nbsp;</p> <p>The nurse from Sierra Leone quoted at the beginning of this article recalled her feelings of being alone, at risk and anxious. \u201cInitially it was chaos \u2013 we didn\u2019t have equipment, we didn\u2019t have senior support, we were short-staffed.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For two long weeks, she and her colleagues worked in an environment she compared to a war zone, tending to patients who were \u201cvery unwell, very unstable, very sick... We didn\u2019t even have masks. We were tired, dehydrated, thirsty,\u201d she continued, still sounding traumatised. She recalled returning home each night to her daughters, thinking: \u201cWhat is happening? How far will this go?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>That anonymous nurse belongs to the BAME community who make up 20% of the NHS workforce. On 25 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">Guardian</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\"> reported</a> that 200 healthcare workers had died from Covid-19. More than six out of 10 victims were from BAME backgrounds. One of their number was urologist Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">18-year-old son voiced</a> what many inside the NHS were feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see NHS workers getting the recognition they deserve,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they should not have to give their lives, they should not have to go as martyrs. They did not sign up to battle on the frontline and give up their lives.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming second pandemic of mental health issues, it may well be those we heralded as heroes who will be among the most vulnerable, alongside key workers on low incomes who also toiled through this long emergency at considerable and often unnecessary risk to their health, their lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf we were prepared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/clap-for-our-carers-the-very-unbritish-ritual-that-united-the-nation\">clap for our health workers</a>, we should also be insisting that they are looked after in the wake of this emergency,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cI want to be optimistic about that, but the market economy has been a disaster for the health service and, within it, mental health has always been the poor sibling. I have spent years saying to my managers, we need more resources, too many people are waiting. If there was no room in the system before this began, what will happen when it ends and we are in the middle of another recession?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Julia Samuel concurs: \u201cThe fear is that the system will be overwhelmed, not least because there is not the parity of resources in mental health that there is in physical health.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way.

In time to come, hard questions must surely be asked about the British death rate and the practical ways many thousands of those deaths might have been prevented. For now, it is the hardest aspect of the pandemic to grasp, much less make sense of. Only months ago, it would have seemed like the stuff of dark imaginings: gothic fiction or apocalyptic sci-fi. How swiftly it has become real; all too real.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Sunday 24 May, <em>The New York Times</em> filled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">its entire front page</a> with death notices from across America, a bold statement that nevertheless only hinted at the immensity of the human toll: 1,000 victims symbolising around 100,000. Outside of wartime or other historical pandemics like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">Spanish flu in 1918</a>, there is no precedent for the number of lives lost within a relatively short period.&nbsp;</p> <p>The global virus has, in the most insidious and cruelly indiscriminate way, turned our world upside down, denting our faith in the infallibility of science and medicine, global capitalism and in progress itself. It has made us fretful for our lives and the lives of those around us, while simultaneously robbing us even of our traditional way of death. Relatives have not been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/05/dying-surrounded-by-family-a-fundamental-right-says-uk-judge\">visit their loved ones in their final days</a> or to be present when they breathed their last.

Without a feathered kiss upon her forehead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Without the muted murmur of familiar family voices gathered around her bed...</p> </blockquote> <p>In composing that sad, defiant elegy, Duffy found a way to express her tumult of emotions in the face of the virus\u2019s assault on our collective sensibilities. In this, though, she was undoubtedly the exception. Countless others have not found a way to articulate their sorrow, their isolation and their disorientation. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cto not be able to say goodbye and then to be forced to grieve alone.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For Orbach, the pandemic has also brutally exposed our culture\u2019s collective denial of the final inevitable. \u201cThe rituals are there to help us get through it,\u201d she elaborates, \u201cbut also because death is such a problematic idea in our culture, an almost impossible idea. We don\u2019t live with death, as it were. Instead, we live to a great degree in denial of it, particularly our own death. And suddenly, we are witnessing death on a grand scale. It has in effect cut through our belief systems, our expectations of what life is.\u201d</p> <p>As someone who specialises in grief, what does Julia Samuel think will be the lasting collective impact of so many deaths, but also of our prolonged proximity to the threat of death?</p> <p>\u201cThe impact will by no means be the same for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cFor an older person to lose a long-term partner so suddenly and unexpectedly is a different experience to a family who have lost someone young who was expected to survive. Both traumas will leave a deep and lasting imprint on their family members.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Samuel points out that guilt is often a component of grief, and may be exacerbated by the ways in which people have died during the pandemic. \u201cTo be the only family member permitted to be present in an ICU is heartbreaking of itself, but then to have to be in full PPE, while your loved one is on a ventilator surrounded by medical staff who also look like astronauts. It is as good as it can be, but it is not the death that anyone would wish for.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Julia Samuel&nbsp;if there is any way to accurately predict what the long-term fallout of the pandemic will be\u2026</p> <p>\u201cAs humans, we are born to adapt,\u201d she says. \u201cBut while we are still in it and so much is still uncertain, I don\u2019t think we have a clue what the long-term consequences will be.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7/186_396_5122_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burial plot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fresh burial plot in Oxfordshire.

The badge of busyness, for instance, has to a degree lost its lustre. Being busy was somehow being important, but maybe people have realised that busyness is essentially an anaesthetic to feeling.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Susie Orbach the same question. She, too, attests to the power of not being frantic.&nbsp;\u201cThe lockdown certainly changed our relationship to time. In the beginning, there was a kind of panic about time running though our hands \u2013 it was two o\u2019clock and suddenly it\u2019s five o\u2019clock. How did that happen? I think not being frantic was a challenge for some people, but for others, the not-doing and simply being became almost mindful. To just be is actually quite liberating.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Will these small epiphanies be enough for the reorientation of our social and political values that some have suggested will be the necessary outcome of this global emergency?&nbsp;Writer and activist Arundhati Roy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">has described the pandemic</a> as \u201ca portal, a gateway between one world and the next\u201d. We can, she suggested, \u201cchoose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.\u201d</p> <p>Orbach&nbsp;cautiously agrees. \u201cPart of me thinks that this is somehow a moment of possibility. Many of us who believe we need to work together to democratise our institutions saw that actually happen when the doctors and nurses took control on the ground, while management did not have a clue.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She pauses for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \u201cIn terms of our political culture, we entered the pandemic with a government born of fright. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/the-observer-view-on-the-danger-posed-by-brexit-during-our-greatest-vulnerability\">Brexit</a> was essentially an act of fright, and the climate of fear that was created left so many people feeling marginalised in this swashbuckling, Darwinian, self, self, self culture. And yet, against all that, when the pandemic happened and real fear spread among us, people wanted to make a contribution, they wanted to be decent.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The experts agree that the psychological fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt for some time to come and that, as ever, the most vulnerable, no matter their recent sacrifices, will be most at risk. In the new normal, will we find ways to be fairer, kinder, more decent when this is all over, if it can ever be said to be truly over?&nbsp;Or will today\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d become tomorrow\u2019s overlooked victims like the traumatised veterans of so many wars we willed ourselves so quickly to forget?&nbsp;</p> <p>Will we hold our political leaders to account when the coming economic crisis inevitably takes precedence over the psychological one and already limited resources are channeled away from a beleaguered NHS that nevertheless saved us from an even deeper, darker abyss?&nbsp;Or will we simply get on with it as before, finding ways to forget that, for a long, uncertain time, when time itself seemed out of joint, we lived amid the mounting dead in a world turned upside down. Ultimately, how we respond to this looming second pandemic may be the measure of how much the first one really taught us about ourselves and the kind of world we want to live in.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;<em>In the UK and Ireland,&nbsp;Samaritans&nbsp;can be contacted on 116 123 or email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">divestments from police</a>. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund).

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone.

A televised memorial service will also be held in the city.</p> \n  <p>Here is a quick recap of the latest developments in the last day or so:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>On Friday, marches and gatherings took place in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, New York and Denver, among other places, while protesters massed again, in the rain, in front of the White House. The night-time protests were largely peaceful but tension remains high even as authorities in several places take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-police-reform\">steps to reform police procedures</a>.</li> \n   <li>A federal judge in Denver ordered city police to stop using tear gas, plastic bullets and other \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d devices such as flash grenades, with his ruling citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/police-violence-protests-us-george-floyd\">examples of protesters and journalists being injured by police</a>.</li> \n   <li>In Minneapolis, Democratic city leaders voted to end the use of knee restraints and choke-holds, where pressure is applied to the neck, while California governor Gavin Newsom said he would end state police training of carotid restraints similar to the technique used on Floyd. </li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter activists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">called for cities to defund police departments</a>. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who in April proposed increasing law enforcement funding, this week reversed course and said he would seek some $150m in cuts to the LA Police Department. </li> \n   <li>National Football League (NFL) commissioner Roger Goodell said the league <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">had made mistakes in not listening to players</a>. The NFL has been locked in a debate with players over kneeling protests during the playing of the national anthem. </li> \n   <li>Two police officers in Buffalo, New York, were suspended without pay on Thursday and placed under investigation after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground. But the decision was met with pushback from the officers\u2019 colleagues, with all 57 members of the police tactical unit quitting in protest at their treatment. </li> \n   <li>Finally, the protests have now spread right across the globe with people in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2020/jun/06/i-cant-breathe-australias-black-lives-matter-protests-in-pictures\">Australia</a>, Japan and South Korea all taking to the streets in solidarity with those in the US and to call out issues of systemic racism in their own countries. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T10:48:59.353Z\">at 11.48am BST</time></p> \n</div>",
