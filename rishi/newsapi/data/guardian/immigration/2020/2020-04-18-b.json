But it\u2019s gradually evolved and you realise: \u2018This can work now.\u2019</p> \n   <p>When we turned up here for the first time we said: \u2018Wow, this is a big empty space, it\u2019s got water, it\u2019s got electricity, it\u2019s got a roof, and nobody\u2019s shooting at you.</p> \n   <p>So actually this is achievable \u2013 that\u2019s not necessarily the case in other theatres we\u2019ve been working in.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The 52-year-old said it was \u201cincredibly impressive\u201d that a high-quality intensive care unit had been set up in what was, in effect, a warehouse.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Somebody said you\u2019re on the train and laying the tracks ahead of you as you are going along \u2013 and that\u2019s absolutely right, you just have to make sure the train doesn\u2019t go too quickly and run away with you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Part of the success, he says, has been through dedication to the welfare of staff, many of whom are working \u201cpretty exhausting\u201d 12-hour shifts. Nightingale workers had borrowed a technique deployed on military operations where staff are paired with a buddy at the start of their shift, encouraging them to look out for one another throughout. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you have eyes with each other when you first go on a shift, you introduce yourselves, and speak to each other after the shift. If they get upset, have a difficult time with a patient or a death, they sit down and have a cup of tea. It worked very well in the past in the military and it\u2019s working very well here,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"780c85dc-9ed5-46a3-83d5-1027c68f2804\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H6pDcV2Lnno?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T13:02:24.066Z\">at 2.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aa8498f08b7689b030bc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:14:15.598Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning from the UK, folks. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy\">Simon Murphy</a> </strong>here, taking over the global live blog now to take you through today\u2019s coronavirus coverage as the world continues to battle the pandemic. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:56:37.700Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a98918f08bade1f2957e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T06:14:07.698Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Teachers, nurses and other workers who are regularly exposed to the public must now take a coronavirus test if they want to leave Wuhan, China has ruled.<br><br>The order comes after the central city, where the coronavirus emerged late last year, lifted a 70-day lockdown that all but ended the epidemic there. <br><br>People in Wuhan working in nursing, education, security and other sectors with high exposure to the public must take a nucleic acid test before leaving, the National Health Commission said. <br><br>Since the city relaxed its lockdown restrictions people who arrived in there before Chinese New Year, when the virus was peaking in China, are allowed to go back to their homes. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd/52_149_2913_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The junction of the Han River and the Yangtze River on April 17, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

After nearly 44 years incarcerated, he would be free from a life sentence handed to him as a juvenile.</p> <p>His sister Yolanda Peterson had prepared a room for him to stay in her Harper Woods home and planned for his parole agent to come see the place. She was brainstorming how, given the coronavirus pandemic, she might help her brother celebrate his 61st birthday at the end of May. </p> <p>Plans for the future fell apart Monday, when Peterson got word that her brother had died unexpectedly in prison. </p> <p>Garrison\u2019s bunkmate found him gasping for air that evening in their two-man cell at Macomb Correctional Facility, according to Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Chris Gautz. Staff performed CPR. Garrison was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Gautz said. </p> <p>A postmortem test confirmed that he was positive for Covid-19. He hadn\u2019t complained to his family or prison staff of coronavirus symptoms.</p> <p>Peterson said it hurts for her brother to die now after \u201csurviving 44 years in prison,\u201d when his freedom was weeks away. \u201cMy brother shouldn\u2019t have died in there like that,\u201d she said Friday evening.</p> <p>Peterson believes that prison staff should have done more to prevent her brother from contracting the virus. She said men in prison have told her that her brother\u2019s cellmate was ill several days before Garrison died.</p> <p>The Department of Corrections disputed that account. Gautz said health care staff went cell-to-cell to assess prisoners in the days before Garrison died, and Garrison\u2019s bunkmate denied having symptoms of Covid-19, aside from a cough. The man later tested negative for the coronavirus when assessed again after Garrison\u2019s death, Gautz said. </p> <p>Garrison is one of 17 state prisoners who\u2019ve died of Covid-19 as of Friday. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b53548f08b7689b030fcd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T19:28:59.754Z\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former treasury secretary to George W Bush dies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe/0_108_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury secretary who broke with <strong>George W.

  "<p>Term one at Australian schools did not so much end as unravel. Its final weeks were described by the New South Wales Teachers Federation as \u201cone of the most difficult school terms for the profession in living memory\u201d.</p> \n<p>Last weekend, the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, acknowledged arrangements will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">differ across states and territories</a> in term two. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://ministers.dese.gov.au/tehan/minister-education-dan-tehan-and-chief-medical-officer-professor-brendan-murphy-press\">nationally consistent approach</a> is that, when it comes to parents who have to work, when it comes to vulnerable children, schools have to be open, and have to make sure that they provide a safe learning environment for those children.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the bulk of students return, Tehan and the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, are suggesting a staggered approach. \u201cWe could consider a return of year 12 and kindergarten, followed by year seven and year six, and progressively pad that out,\u201d Gavrielatos <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/year-12-kindy-should-get-priority-when-school-goes-back-teachers-federation-20200409-p54inb.html\">said last week</a>.</p> \n<p>Until then, for many of Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4221.0\">four million students,</a> school is at home \u2013 but it\u2019s not home-schooling per se. \u201cHome-schooling is when you make, or buy, your own curriculum,\u201d says Rebecca English, a professor at Queensland University of Technology\u2019s faculty of education. \u201c[These families] are simply facilitating their children\u2019s learning at home.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">Are schools open or closed for term 2 amid coronavirus in Australia?

The Victorian government is <a href=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/victorian-students-to-learn-from-home-as-vce-timelines-revised/\">loaning</a> around 6,000 devices to students in need, and providing SIM cards or dongles to others. NSW has a <a href=\"https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/learning-from-home/leading-from-home/digital-equity-solutions#Assess0\">similar scheme</a>, prioritising year 12 students. Meanwhile, telecommunications companies, including Telstra, Optus and budget providers, are offering free bonus <a href=\"https://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/Guides/every-telco-COVID-19-coronavirus-assistance-package\">data</a> and waiving late payment fees.</p> \n<p>The main stress for families not under financial strain is that parents or carers were rapidly thrust into working from home too, often full-time. Matt Levinson lives in the Sydney suburb of Rozelle with his wife, Polly, a part-time physiotherapist at a hospital, and their children, Archer, nine, and Nina, 11. The couple took their children out of Rozelle public school three weeks ago when attendance in NSW <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-schools-disruption-as-covid19-causes-online-learning/12096560\">fell</a> to around 20%.</p> \n<p>Before Covid-19 struck, Levinson\u2019s job with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees was office-based but now he\u2019s at home. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job and I\u2019m so grateful for that,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s been stressful. \u201cThose moments when you\u2019re trying to get through work and be available to workmates as well as support your kids or, like, solve a technical problem with signing in to Zoom or [Google] classroom or whatever,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Space is tight in the family\u2019s cottage. \u201cWe got a second-hand desk for my daughter but my son and I are both at the kitchen table working. The learning environment is very much patched together.\u201d Meanwhile Levinson\u2019s work is \u201cabsolutely peaking\u201d, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a worldwide crisis around preparing for the coronavirus response in refugee settlements.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf36de8058b425f6d9aaa7b5fad471bf89a7a2d5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf36de8058b425f6d9aaa7b5fad471bf89a7a2d5/0_77_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Levinson at home with his children Archer and Nina during coronavirus lockdowns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Levinson at home with his children Archer and Nina during coronavirus lockdowns.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Levinson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Five Dock public school principal, Amanda Dawkins, understands parents\u2019 struggle. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people out there thinking \u2018if I\u2019m not productive, I\u2019m going to lose the job\u2019.\u201d Dawkins says the wellbeing of Five Dock\u2019s school community, teachers and students is paramount and that her Monday virtual assemblies are to \u201ctry to keep kids connected at a time of great disconnect\u201d.</p> \n<p>The impact of isolation is everywhere, she says. \u201cTeachers have rung up and can\u2019t get parents off the phone because it\u2019s another adult to talk to.

For the little kids, it\u2019s 15 minutes. If they\u2019re getting wriggly or poking their sibling or there\u2019s a lot of sighing going on, it\u2019s time for a break.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told families, if kids come back with the skills and knowledge they had when they left us, I\u2019m happy.

Everyone\u2019s finding their feet and we need to be gentle with each other and with ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Samantha Thomas is the mother of a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who attend a public high school in Melbourne. Thomas had arranged time off work to transition her children but was pleasantly surprised at the school\u2019s implementation of remote learning. \u201cIt\u2019s clear a really significant amount of work was done to create structured lessons that engage the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so smooth that I\u2019ve still been able to get quite a bit of work done myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Key to her 12-year-old\u2019s success is how he\u2019s connected with a friend. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working as a pair \u2013 he\u2019s taken it onto himself to do that. It\u2019s been interesting to hear them help and motivate each other with work or things they don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a really great skill for kids to learn as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both children workshopped a way to stay active by playing basketball in their lunch break. Again, says Thomas, it was their idea \u2013 not hers. \u201cAs a parent I probably underestimated their ability to problem solve and overcome challenges, including adapting to this new environment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With children Nina and Archer, Levinson and his wife are encouraging longer-term projects steered by the children. \u201cTheir set work doesn\u2019t fill whole days and they can\u2019t go and play with their friends.

We\u2019ll keep some of the school structure over the holiday because all the other structure has kind of disappeared.\u201d</p> \n<p>Encouraging kids to pursue their own interests is a great idea for older kids too, English says. \u201cIt\u2019s agency and self-determination over their learning that they probably don\u2019t get at school. This time could potentially be a real boon. Everything is so siloed in school but I think we should be thinking more about integrating curriculum areas. We know from the research it\u2019s more interesting for students and teachers.</p> \n<p>Baking and gardening are examples, she says. \u201cWith baking a cake there\u2019s fractions and mass, mathematical concepts. Recipes are procedural texts and then you have elements of science, like, \u2018how does exposing this particular concoction to heat change it?\u2019.

You talk about intergenerationality and tell stories, which relates back to English.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dawkins says it will be interesting when all the students come back. \u201cThe kids at school have become quite close. It\u2019s really nice, they\u2019re playing together and working together.\u201d In general, she hopes the return will herald a time that is \u201csofter and less focused on the academic\u201d, she says. \u201cParents are getting to know their children, in some cases, and that\u2019s that\u2019s a really positive thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Levinson agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough but also a rare joy to have this time with my kids. I feel like I\u2019m seeing a totally different side of them, really understanding the way they work. When we go back to normality, assuming we do, this will be a time I will treasure.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Almost exactly two years ago, <a href=\"https://kurtelling.com/\">Kurt Elling </a>brought out <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/08/kurt-elling-the-questions-review-branford-marsalis\">The Questions</a></em>, an album that demanded much of the listener \u2013 the opposite, you might say, of easy listening. The questions it asked were sociopolitical; he later summed them up as: \u201cHow did we get in this mess and what are we going to do about it?\u201d This time the problems in question are immigration, human rights and climate change. As before, the approach is oblique. Elling adds his own lyrics to compositions by Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius and his own close collaborator, the Panamanian pianist <a href=\"http://www.daniloperez.com/\">Danilo P\u00e9rez</a>.</p> <p>He also adapts from contemporary poets, including Toni Morrison. We are left to make our own connections. It\u2019s a dangerous procedure, since the only thing preventing people from simply giving up is the grip of the music, the fascination of the lyrics and Elling\u2019s own voice. Fortunately, there\u2019s some absolutely blazing stuff from P\u00e9rez and drummer <a href=\"http://www.johnathanblake.com/\">Johnathan Blake</a>, who seems to be everywhere these days. Elling himself has been hailed as the male jazz vocalist of the age, with a voice in a million. All this was more than enough to keep me listening.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epNXnqT-g28\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epNXnqT-g28?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=36&amp;v=epNXnqT-g28&amp;feature=emb_title\">Watch Elling and Danilo P\u00e9rez performing music from the new album.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Suddenly, changes that would in pre-corona times have generated years of debate, dissent, hesitation, opposition and delay turn out to be possible overnight.</p> <p>Exhibit A in this context is the way in which hundreds of thousands of white-collar workers are suddenly able \u2013 indeed, required \u2013 to work from home.</p> <p>Exhibit B \u2013 more worrying \u2013 is the way governments are either <a href=\"https://pandemicbigbrother.online/en/\">already deploying</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/growth-in-surveillance-may-be-hard-to-scale-back-after-coronavirus-pandemic-experts-say\">actively considering</a>, surveillance technology of such intrusiveness that it would have caused outrage and furious protests even a month ago.</p> <p>Exhibit C is <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology\">the decision</a> of the two huge tech companies that control mobile phone technology \u2013 Apple with its iOS operating system and Google with Android \u2013 to create application programming interfaces (APIs) that will enable governments to build and deploy proximity-tracking apps on every smartphone in the world. This is remarkable in two ways. One, it involves cooperation between the two members of a global duopoly that would normally trigger antitrust suits \u2013 yet there hasn\u2019t been even a whimper from competition authorities. And two, the companies insist that if governments do not comply with the conditions that they \u2013 Apple and Google \u2013 are laying down, then they will withdraw the APIs. The specific condition is that apps using the APIs are not mandatory for citizens. They have to be opt-in. So here we have two powerful global corporations laying down the law to territorial sovereigns. Unthinkable a month ago. But now\u2026</p> <p>Signs of dramatic changes are everywhere \u2013 even in GP surgeries. The <em>New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/telemedicine-uk-coronavirus.html\">interesting report</a> on how the work of GPs in London is being transformed by the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re basically witnessing 10 years of change in one week,\u201d one GP told the paper. \u201cIt used to be that 95% of patient contact was face-to-face: you go to see your doctor, as it has been for decades, centuries. But that has changed completely.\u201d Before the virus, video appointments made up only 1% of annual appointments with British GPs and other practice staff. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/gps-told-to-switch-to-remote-consultations-to-combat-covid-19\">NHS has urged</a> thousands of clinics across the country to start switching to remote consultations and has fast-tracked approval of digital providers to ramp up their offerings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is still a serious digital divide and on the wrong side of it are many elderly people \u2013 who are the most at risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of these providers is accuRx, which was already being used by many GPs as a trusted tool for sending text messages to patients. As the crisis deepened, accuRx built a video-calling system <em>over a weekend</em> after the virus arrived in the UK and has \u2013 according to the <em>NYT</em> report \u2013 quickly become \u201cthe go-to provider for online appointments, offering a stripped-down interface and the comfort of having long been in primary care clinics\u201d. Having watched one of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aryAqMqdHg0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">instructional videos</a>, I can see why it\u2019s taken off. Zoom could learn a few tricks from them.</p> <p>While the pandemic continues to turn the world upside down, new realisations are beginning to dawn on us. As the tech analyst Ben Evans <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/4/13/covid-and-forced-experiments\">puts it</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re all online now, and, just as importantly, we\u2019re all willing to use this for any part of our lives, if you can work out the right experience and business model. Today, anyone will do anything online.\u201d</p> <p>Well, up to a point. While it\u2019s true that not being online suddenly puts one at a real disadvantage, community volunteers up and down the country are realising that there is still a serious digital divide: and on the wrong side of it are many elderly people \u2013 who are the most at risk from the virus.</p> <p>The most important implication of the breakneck changes currently under way, though, is that there\u2019s no going back to normality. That train has left the station. The coronavirus isn\u2019t going away. And even when there is a vaccine, the risk will endure, because climate change and the erosion of wildlife habitats will <a href=\"https://jembendell.com/2020/03/23/the-climate-for-corona-our-warming-world-is-more-vulnerable-to-pandemic/\">ensure a ready supply</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis\">zoonotic viruses</a>. Companies will have learned to build supply chains with resilience built in. White collar workers will have discovered that they don\u2019t have do as much commuting as before. Air travel will go back to being a luxury. And so on.</p> <p>A useful metaphor for the new normal will be what happens when driving a car on black ice. The worst thing to do is to slam on the brakes, because then you completely lose control. Instead you pump them \u2013 brake a little, then back off and repeat the process until back on gritty tarmac. Our immediate futures will be like that: a combination of what some people are beginning to call \u201cthe hammer and the dance\u201d \u2013 the hammer of successive lockdowns followed by digital dances in which we use surveillance and testing to find and control outbreaks. We are heading into a cautious, rather than a brave, new world \u2013 with Orwellian overtones. I wonder what Aldous Huxley would have made of that.</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading</h2> <p><strong>Covid and forced experiments<br></strong>A long and <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/4/13/covid-and-forced-experiments\">thoughtful essay</a> by Benedict Evans.

  "<p>When the explosion ripped through the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, Leo Linder was standing in his living quarters in his underwear. He suddenly found himself facing a fellow rig worker in what had been a separate room because the force of the explosion had blown the walls away.</p> <p>Linder wasn\u2019t to know it at the time but the blast was to trigger the worst environment disaster in US history, with the BP operation spewing more than 4.9m barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, fouling hundreds of miles of shoreline from Texas to Florida, decimating wildlife and crippling local fishing and tourism industries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/13/deepwater-horizon-disaster-oil-worse-impact-study-finds\">Deepwater Horizon disaster had much worse impact than believed, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spill also had a human cost, with 11 workers dying in the disaster. One of them, Gordon Jones, had relieved Linder around an hour before the explosion. \u201cHe said, \u2018What the hell are you doing, go home,\u2019\u201d Linder said. \u201cIn many ways he saved my life. The guilt from surviving, as well as the damage done, still gnaws at me. It kills me.\u201d</p> <p>The 10th anniversary of the disaster, which began on 20 April 2010, marks a period of devastation and partial recovery, with billions of dollars extracted from BP to aid a clean-up that is still under way.

It was even more depressing than Hurricane Katrina and that flooded my house.\u201d</p> <p>Kimble has had to raise her house twice on stilts due to the threat of flooding in an area prone to storms and coastal erosion accelerated by the climate crisis. The process has also been worsened by the oil and gas industry\u2019s practice of forging canals through wetlands, which has introduced corrosive salt water. The nearby town of Pointe \u00e0 la Hache was turned into a \u201cghost town\u201d as fishing opportunities vanished, Kimble said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit like the coronavirus, just dead,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s recovered, to tell you the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The fishing industry is a major constituent of life in southern Louisiana and shutting down the ability to catch fish, oysters and shrimp was a major blow to communities. Many of the fishermen and women used their boats to help the clean-up effort by deploying booms and spreading oil dispersant.</p> <p>Even after the Gulf was declared safe to fish in again, crews initially reported pulling in smaller catches of oddly deformed fish with oozing sores. Dolphins started dying in record numbers, tuna and amberjack developed deformities to their heart and other organs. Scientists have also found lingering problems within the web of marine life.</p> <p>Recent <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62574-y\">research</a> by the University of Florida found the richness of species in the Gulf has declined by more than a third due to direct and indirect impacts of the spill. A separate <a href=\"https://www.usf.edu/news/2020/10-year-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-research-concludes.aspx\">study</a> of 2,500 individual fish from 91 species by the University of South Florida found oil exposure in all of them.</p> <p>Many of the species are popular types of seafood. The extent of the exposure has startled researchers.</p> <p>\u201cWe were quite surprised that among the most contaminated species was the fast-swimming yellowfin tuna as they are not found at the bottom of the ocean where most oil pollution in the Gulf occurs,\u201d said lead author Erin Pulster, a researcher at the university\u2019s college of marine science.</p> <p>The seafood industry lost nearly $1bn, while house prices in the region declined by as much as 8% for at least five years, according to a report by the conservation group Oceana.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"520c2e546e7acb198567455c6c0171268e6ba58d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/520c2e546e7acb198567455c6c0171268e6ba58d/0_124_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this photo taken on 14 June 2010, crosses with descriptions of fish, wildlife and summer pastimes are displayed in a front yard of a home in Grand Isle, Louisiana, of things potentially lost to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In this photo taken on 14 June 2010, crosses with descriptions of fish, wildlife and summer pastimes potentially lost to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are displayed in a front yard in Grand Isle, Louisiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was an entire Gulf of Mexico-wide event,\u201d said Tracey Sutton, a marine scientist at Nova Southeastern University. told Oceana. \u201cNobody was ready for this scale of pollution. As far as we know, the actual impact of the spill is not over yet.\u201d</p> <p>Deepwater Horizon exploded 40 miles off the coast and shot out oil that proved devilishly difficult to clean from the nooks and crannies of Louisiana\u2019s marshland. An initial attempt to cap the spill was unsuccessful, necessitating the drilling of a secondary relief well to stem the flow. It took four months to completely stop the gushing oil.</p> <p>In all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/bps-deepwater-horizon-bill-tops-65bn\">BP </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/bps-deepwater-horizon-bill-tops-65bn\">paid out </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/bps-deepwater-horizon-bill-tops-65bn\">about $65</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/bps-deepwater-horizon-bill-tops-65bn\">n</a> in compensation, legal fees and clean-up costs, which includes billions for affected states. A judge <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-29069184\">ruled</a> the petrochemical giant was \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d in the lead-up to the disaster. Subcontractors Transocean and Halliburton were \u201cnegligent\u201d, the judge said.</p> <p>The payment of the compensation money adds to the complex relationship states like Louisiana, which bore the brunt of the spill, have with the oil industry. The industry caused an environmental and societal catastrophe along the coast and is contributing towards the climate crisis that threatens more and more of the state with inundation each year.</p> <p>But the compensation paid has helped fund various coastal conservation projects and oil and gas remain major, and largely popular, employers in the region. Linder was only on Deepwater Horizon because the pay was four times the $28,000 a year he was earning as an English teacher.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone realized right off the bat we\u2019d have this unprecedented natural disaster,\u201d said Chip Kline, an assistant to Governor John Bel Edwards and chairman of the <a href=\"http://coastal.la.gov/\">Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA)</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the spill there were some intense moments with BP but in Louisiana we have an economy largely driven by oil and gas; it employs a lot of Louisiana residents. We try to strike a balance.\u201d</p> <p>A decade on, with an incomplete recovery, coastal Gulf communities face a Trump administration that is attempting to reverse many of the safety-based regulations imposed after the oil spill. Residents are hoping this won\u2019t lead to a repeat.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me sick to the stomach thinking about all the oil out there in the beautiful Gulf of Mexico,\u201d said Kimble. \u201cI hope and pray to God it never happens again.\u201d</p>",

Harris said her Facebook following grew from \u201c700-800 people\u201d to more than 15,000 members following the Michigan rally, inspiring her to organize \u201cOperation Gridlock Annapolis\u201d for Saturday.</p> \n<p>Harris said her group had support from some elected officials in Maryland, but declined to name them.</p> \n<p>While ReOpen Maryland might not have funding from rightwing advocacy groups, it appears to be linked to at least four other \u201creopen\u201d organizations.</p> \n<p>\u201cGovernment mandating sick people to stay home is called quarantine,\u201d ReOpen Maryland said. \u201cHowever, the government mandating healthy citizens to stay home, forcing businesses and churches to close is called tyranny.\u201d</p> \n<p>That text is identical to text on Facebook pages calling for rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

But the figures are not universally bleak. In some states, including California, the infection and death rates appear comparatively low for Latinos. Though Latinos make up 39% of California\u2019s population, they account for <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx\">30% </a>of Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>Still, public health experts warn that the official statistics may be underestimating the virus\u2019s toll on Latino communities wary of seeking medical care due to a lack of health insurance, and in many cases fear that going to a hospital will expose them to immigration authorities.</p> <p>\u201cI would put lots of grains of salt on these figures,\u201d said David Hayes-Bautista, who directs the Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture at the UCLA School of Medicine. \u201cThink about who had access to the testing, and who\u2019s getting into the hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>The disparities boil down to differences not only in race but also in income and access, Hayes-Bautista said. \u201cThe problems aren\u2019t genetic,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey are structural.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c4a437a230580cec812086ce6770f2740cca6bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a437a230580cec812086ce6770f2740cca6bac/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmworkers clean a carrot field in Arvin, California, during the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farmworkers clean a carrot field in Arvin, California, during the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Economic disparities, health vulnurabilities</h2> <p>With the exception of diabetes, Latinos on average have lower rates of heart disease, cancers, hypertension and other underlying conditions that make people especially vulnerable to Covid-19, Hayes-Bautista noted. But Latinos make up a large proportion of what is now considered the \u201cessential\u201d workforce of grocery store staff, restaurant workers, caretakers, cleaners and delivery workers, and are putting themselves at the frontlines of the pandemic.</p> <p>Christian Zamarron, whose family is from Mexico, works part-time in an Amazon warehouse in Chicago where he makes $15 an hour. Amazon promised workers an extra $2 an hour for working during the pandemic. But like his part-time colleagues, Zamarron doesn\u2019t get health insurance. Instead, Amazon provides $9 extra a week in \u201chealth pay\u201d that can go toward health care costs.</p> <p>\u201cMy bills haven\u2019t stopped, so I have to keep going,\u201d Zamarron said. \u201cI need the money, but I\u2019m there to speak up for my co-workers. A lot of the stuff that we\u2019re moving isn\u2019t even essential goods. This is reckless endangerment of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>For many Latinos, the economic fallout from the pandemic is just as worrying as the health risks, leaving many with little choice but to risk their lives at frontline jobs. But unemployment has also disproportionately affected Latinos. Compared to the overall US population, Latinos disproportionately say that they or someone in their household has taken a pay cut, lost a job or both since the pandemic hit, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/03/u-s-latinos-among-hardest-hit-by-pay-cuts-job-losses-due-to-coronavirus/\">a recent report</a> from the Pew Research Center.</p> <p>For Rafaela Berry and her mom, Brazilian immigrants now living in Atlanta, coronavirus is already slashing income. Berry works as a nanny and in the past has helped her mom clean houses. In recent weeks, more and more of their clients have cancelled cleanings, she said, either because they\u2019ve been laid off, or out of concern that a visitor could bring the virus into the house. They used to clean four or five houses a day. Now there\u2019s one house to clean every four days.</p> <p>To get by, Berry\u2019s mom began selling $5 masks she sewed herself. For Berry, it\u2019s impossible to separate the health risks from the economic toll the virus could take.</p> <p>\u201cThe sickness is scary, but not so much for the health risks,\u201d she said. \u201cIf one of us gets sick and goes to the hospital, we\u2019ll have medical bills. But we also won\u2019t be able to make money to pay them off.\u201d</p> <p>With economic disparities layered upon health disparities, the Latino workers who most need access to health insurance and government benefits are least able to access it. Latinos have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group in the US. And only 38% of Latinos working low-wage jobs have access to health coverage, according to a <a href=\"https://www.mijentesupportcommittee.com/post/report-release-covid-19-and-the-impact-on-latinos-in-the-u-s\">report</a> from Mijente and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, published Thursday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"719eeff9dad8ea86e99733e404937b98d4df11e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/719eeff9dad8ea86e99733e404937b98d4df11e8/0_207_5393_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juana, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador and her husband Saul, from Honduras, both lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juana, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador and her husband Saul, from Honduras, both lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Governments discriminate\u2019</h2> <p>Moreover, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/i-have-a-broken-heart-trump-policy-has-immigrants-backing-away-from-healthcare-amid-crisis\">Trump administration policies</a> discouraging Latino immigrants from making use of public health insurance and government benefits such as food stamps \u2013 as well as the continuation of immigration enforcement \u2013 even as Covid-19 spread through the country, has ratcheted up the fear that asking for assistance could land them on the radar of immigration officials or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/14/will-they-take-my-kids-away-the-immigrants-refusing-food-aid-amid-trump-crackdown\">separate them from their children</a>.</p> <p>At Massachusetts General in Boston, medical staff are trying to \u201chammer the message in our Latino communities that it\u2019s safe to get tested, it\u2019s safe to get care\u201d, said Dr Joseph Betancourt, the vice-president and chief equity and inclusion officer at the hospital. \u201cBut of course there\u2019s still mistrust.

But we\u2019re trying to lift their spirits, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Latinos make up almost three-quarters of the estimated 10.5m undocumented people living in the US. Although they commonly have taxes deducted from paychecks, undocumented people typically cannot benefit from unemployment assistance. Nor will they see the stimulus checks of up $1,200 that many Americans will receive.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t discriminate. But governments do,\u201d said Leticia Casildo, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras living in New Orleans, who has spent recent weeks delivering food to immigrant families as part of her organizing role with the nonprofit Familias Unidas en Acci\u00f3n.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately people don\u2019t see us as worth saving,\u201d Casildo said in Spanish. \u201cThe good thing about the undocumented community is that we\u2019re used to creating our own reality and finding ways to take care of each other.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates urging lawmakers to step in have made some headway.

Earlier today, the premier, <strong>Mark McGowan, </strong>said the man had been to Bali in March and described the travel as \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s new statement this evening says the case is \u201cnot cause for alarm\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Rio Tinto conducted the test but public health officials are working to verify the results because the test used might not be reliable. </p> \n  <p>From the statement:</p> \n  <p>\u201cWestern Australians can be reassured that a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a mining worker, following a blood test performed by mining company Rio Tinto, is not cause for alarm and should not be interpreted as potential community transmission.</p> \n  <p>Western Australia\u2019s Chief Health Officer, Dr Andrew Robertson, said the case was one of only three being reported in WA overnight, with the other two linked to the cruise ship Artania.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the Department of Health was investigating the case and undertaking appropriate contact tracing but that there was no evidence of community transmission resulting from this case.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the case had become mildly symptomatic shortly after returning from a trip to Indonesia which would indicate he most likely contracted the virus overseas. He was in isolation for the period in which he would have been infectious.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the pin-prick test performed by Rio Tinto was <em>not</em> an acute diagnostic test or even a reliable means of screening for current Covid-19 infection.</p> \n  <p>He said the reason point-of-care testing had been banned as an acute diagnostic test under emergency provisions of the Public Health Act was because it measured the presence of antibodies to Covid-19 \u2013 not the virus itself. This could lead to results being misinterpreted, with both false negatives and false positives being common, as demonstrated by recent such testing.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said public health officials were currently working to verify the results of the individual at an accredited laboratory because the validity of the point-of-care test was unknown.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:35:08.493Z\">at 9.35am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ab13f8f08bade1f29582b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:50:46.189Z\">8.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here\u2019s the Queensland premier:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeAt20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MeAt20</a> - in Queensland of course! <a href=\"https://t.co/QQDBc0Mrkd\">pic.twitter.com/QQDBc0Mrkd</a></p>\u2014 Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:01:57.125Z\">at 9.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aaae98f080ee11044736d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:25:52.213Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Over the past few days, the #MeAt20 challenge has taken off on Twitter.

One of the deaths that happened yesterday was a 42-year-old man who was a crew member on the Artania cruise ship, which is leaving Fremantle today on its way to the Philippines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo that is by far our youngest person that has died in Australia from this disease, and a terrible tragedy for that man and his family,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cBut it is a reminder for us that this is not just an old person\u2019s disease. We are all in this together for a reason. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause it can affect any of us, and while it is true to say that the majority of cases, over 80%, are mild, some of them can be very severe. <strong>We still have 55 people across Australia in intensive care right now, some of those have been ventilated, some of them extremely sick. </strong>These are really strong reminders for us why we are taking this disease seriously and why, indeed, the whole world is taking this pandemic seriously. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are continuing to concentrate on the way out of where we are now. Australia has done extremely well compared with the rest of the world up to this point. But it is not a time for us to decrease the measures that we have in place. We have, for example, been one of the major testing countries for Covid-19 and a recent paper published by the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine \u2013 I am an alumnus of that institution \u2013 shows that we are at the highest level in terms of case ascertainment and making sure that the cases that are out there are being found. </p> \n  <p>\u201c<strong>We reached a milestone: we now have over 400,000 tests that have been done here in Australia, and so again, by sheer numbers, we are doing a lot of testing. </strong>But one of the challenges that was put back to the Australian health committee from the national cabinet on Thursday was for us to <strong>continue to look and consider what our testing strategy should be into the future. So that is part of our surveillance plan that we are developing, and we had a discussion about that today at our Australian health committee meeting with the other chief health offices. I chaired that meeting today and we discussed what that surveillance plan should look like and particularly what should we be doing in terms of expanding testing</strong> now that we have that capability to do so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe other thing we discussed today at the committee meeting was about our rapid response capability. How should we, and how could we, respond to things like what is occurring in north-western Tasmania at the moment?\u201d</p> \n  <p>He is referring here to the healthcare worker in Tasmania with the virus who worked across with three aged-care facilities in the north-west, and as a result in the past 24 hours, almost 500 tests have been done on all the residents and the staff of those facilities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:43:05.422Z\">at 6.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a8a378f08b7689b030b83\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:11:00.104Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key announcements and updates from today:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The <strong>federal government has said its Covid-19 tracing app will not be compulsory. </strong>The government services minister, Stuart Robert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/18/australia-coronavirus-updates-live-investigations-into-aged-care-homes-amid-outbreaks-latest-news?page=with:block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4#block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4\">revealed details about how the app will work</a>, saying there will be no geolocation, surveillance, or tracking of people with the app, and that the federal government would not have access to any of the app\u2019s data.

The privacy commissioner is involved, and all that will be made public. <strong>The source code will be made public,</strong> so all Australians can have absolute assurance, from the privacy right the way to the security, right the way to the individual elements, the bits and bytes of the code, that the app is simply a health app for individuals voluntarily used to help us trace those who may have been close to someone who has been infected by the virus. </p> \n   <p>So we want to be as transparent as we possibly can.

He says it\u2019s critical to get out of bed at a normal time in the morning.</p> <p> Although all the usual life cues are gone \u2013 like lectures, or meeting friends \u2013 we need to keep the things that synchronise our body clocks, Morgan says, such as meal times, recreation, and winding down in the evening.</p> <p>Keeping a routine not only helps with sleep but will keep you motivated, says survival psychologist Dr Sarita Robinson, from the University of Central Lancashire. \u201cPeople in extreme environments can survive and come out mentally intact because they have appropriate coping mechanisms. A structured plan can be really helpful in keeping you motivated, so you don\u2019t just fall away into feeling listless and depressed.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and include time to study</strong></h2> <p>Build studying into your routine. Mike Leaf, a final year geoscience student at Keele University, advises giving yourself deadlines. Setting yourself a goal of finishing a chapter of a project by the weekend, for example, will \u201ckeep you focused without guidance from supervisors.\u201d</p> <p>Lee says she checks in with friends to keep on task. She calls them her accountability buddies. \u201cWe motivate each other to finish our aims for the day.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Set goals, but no pressure</strong></h2> <p>Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to achieve. This is an unprecedented time, and \u201cit\u2019s absolutely OK to not be OK at the moment,\u201d Robinson says. It\u2019s good to have goals, she adds \u2013 \u201cbut my goals aren\u2019t things like I\u2019m going to write a high-impact journal. My goals are finishing that jigsaw, or spending an hour learning how to dance the Charleston. Low-level goals keep you motivated.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out</strong></h2> <p>See what support is on offer at your university or students\u2019 union. Robinson says: \u201cIt\u2019s about reassuring students that we\u2019re here for them. There is a lot of support, especially for international students unable to travel home, or students estranged from families.\u201d</p> <p>Call your friends and family, and arrange virtual pub quizzes or games. \u201cIf you\u2019re a person who enjoys social contact, then it\u2019s about trying to find a new way to connect,\u201d she adds.</p> <h2><strong>Stay active</strong></h2> <p>Morgan says the key is to get outside to exercise. \u201cGet out and do a sensible amount of exercise when the sun is bright. Tell your physiology that it\u2019s daylight. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you can exercise yourself to sleep \u2013 you can\u2019t, but what you can do is relieve some of the stresses that would otherwise accumulate through a confined environment.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/20/what-should-uk-students-do-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">What should UK students do during the coronavirus outbreak?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Exercise doesn\u2019t have to be a workout. \u201cIt can mean moderate walking. It can simply mean being outdoors, raising your heart rate at about 50%,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Lee adds: \u201cWhenever I feel anxious, I make sure to get out of the house and take my one hour of exercise. I can take a breather. It\u2019s about listening to your body.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Get in touch with nature \u2013 inside or out</strong></h2> <p>The mental health benefits from interacting with green space are huge. If you can, go for a walk in a park or garden. But if that\u2019s not possible, bring the garden inside instead. \u201cTry virtual tours,\u201d suggests Robinson. \u201dJust looking at green scenery has been shown to be beneficial. Growing things is also very therapeutic.\u201d</p> <p>Extensive research suggests gardening helps reduce anxiety and stress-related symptoms. You can still grow plants if you\u2019re living in one room in block halls. Herbs such as coriander or rosemary are good for windowsills, and you can even get a (free) houseplant after eating an avocado. Fill a glass with water, and <a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/gardening/a26064095/how-to-grow-avocado-tree/\">put toothpicks in the avocado stone to suspend </a><a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/gardening/a26064095/how-to-grow-avocado-tree/\"> it on the rim, so the bottom half rests in water</a>. Make sure it has sunlight, and when the stone sprouts, pot some compost and watch it grow.</p> <h2><strong>Change perspective ...</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf you start thinking that you\u2019re stuck in your room, that can be quite demoralising. Rephrase it to \u2018I\u2019m safe in my room, I\u2019ve got opportunities to do things that I can concentrate on,\u2019\u201d Robinson says.</p> <h2><strong>... and try new things</strong></h2> <p>Many exercise classes, social activities, concerts, and theatre shows are taking place online, so there will always be something to keep you busy. See if your favourite artist or comedian is livestreaming a gig. Or use this time to discover new experiences, whether it\u2019s cooking, gaming, or going to the theatre (virtually). There are resources to help you find these new and mostly free experiences. For example, <a href=\"https://www.cheapskatelondon.com/\">Cheapskate newsletter</a>, which normally lists affordable things to do in London, is now collating the week\u2019s best free indoor activities, from digital art tours to \u201ce-life drawing\u201d workshops.</p>",
  "<p>My inbox is flooding with emails from PR companies trying to make things they would have to promote anyway sound coronavirus-relevant: Bacteria Busting Bedding; Lockdown Weddings; WFH Wallpaper Offers.

This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. </p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country.

It said that all deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 needed to be recorded, whether they occurred in hospitals, homes or care homes.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, health ministry figures put the total number of cases in Spain at 188,068 \u2013 up 5,252 from the previous day. That suggests an overnight increase in new cases of 2.9%, which is well in line with recent daily increases \u2013 and markedly down from the 38% daily rise seen when the state of emergency was declared in Spain just over a month ago.</p> \n  <p>The same set of figures show an overnight death toll of 348 \u2013 well down on recent days. But speaking at his daily press conference, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies put the overnight death toll at 585.</p> \n  <p>The new recording and reporting criteria also seem to have skewed the number of cured people. On Thursday, the health ministry said that 74,797 people across Spain had recovered.
