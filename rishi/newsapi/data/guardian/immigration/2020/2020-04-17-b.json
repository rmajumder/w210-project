The death toll in hospitals rose to 11,478 from 11,060, while fatalities in nursing homes rose to 7,203 from 6,860 on Thursday.</p> <h2>US using pandemic to unlawfully expel asylum seekers, says UN</h2> <p>An unprecedented US policy that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-asylum-seekers-coronavirus-law-un\">uses the pandemic as grounds</a> to summarily expel people who have migrated to or sought asylum in the country violates international law, the United Nations warns.</p> <h2>More than 14,000 have died in UK hospitals</h2> <p>The British government announced that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e99aa648f08b7689b030455#block-5e99aa648f08b7689b030455\">further 847 people have died</a> in UK hospitals, taking the total to 14,576 since the outbreak began. That represents slightly decelerated growth. But the figures do not take into account those who have died in other settings.</p> <h2>Nearly 100,000 EU citizens remain stranded</h2> <p>The European commission says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e99c3e68f080ee110446dd9#block-5e99c3e68f080ee110446dd9\">98,900 EU citizens are still stuck abroad</a>, though efforts to bring them home continue. That compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak.</p> <p>The figures reveal the UK government has made sparing use of the EU programme to repatriate citizens, under which the bloc funds 75% of the cost of emergency flights.</p> <h2>Health workers to run out of protective gear</h2> <p>Health bosses in England are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">preparing to ask doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns</a> when treating patients, as hospitals are set to run out of supplies within hours.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone.\u201d The cry of the Ancient Mariner, immortalised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, feels particularly apposite today as the world self-isolates. Now the 18th-century poem is set to be reimagined, in a daily online reading by stars from Marianne Faithfull to Iggy Pop, Jeremy Irons and Tilda Swinton for a world audience in lockdown.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ancientmarinerbigread.com/\">Ancient Mariner Big Read</a>, which launches on Saturday and was commissioned by The Arts Institute at Plymouth University, will see the 150-verse poem divided into 40 readings, with readers from Faithfull to Irons each recording three or four verses to be broadcast daily for free. (Faithfull recorded it before being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/04/marianne-faithfull-hospitalised-with-coronavirus\">hospitalised with the coronavirus</a>.) The project will combine the readings with works from major artists including Marina Abramovi\u0107, and refocus on the poem\u2019s \u201curgent ecological message\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe had no idea that we would be pulling this together as all of this happened,\u201d said co-curator Philip Hoare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/24/scienceandnature\">author of Leviathan or, The Whale</a>, winner of the 2009 Samuel Johnson prize. But Hoare said that the Ancient Mariner Big Read would offer \u201ca brand-new digital work of art to be experienced at home \u2013 in a wild voyage into the unknown and watery world\u201d.</p> <p>Coleridge\u2019s poem opens as the Ancient Mariner collars a reluctant Wedding Guest and begins telling him about a disastrous sea voyage. After the Mariner kills an albatross, his ship becomes becalmed. As Coleridge writes, in some of the most famous lines in poetry, the vessel lies \u201cas idle as a painted ship / Upon a painted ocean\u201d, with \u201cWater, water, every where, / Nor any drop to drink.\u201d</p> <p>The Mariner is forced to wear the albatross around his neck, and is the only survivor when the ship is visited by a boat bearing Death, prompting his famous cry: \u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone, / Alone on a wide wide sea!\u201d \u2013 a section which is taken on, dramatically, by Faithfull for the Big Read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"02877d3eea3ecf20f3883902d718c2720a13e81a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02877d3eea3ecf20f3883902d718c2720a13e81a/8_0_1781_2225/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Shallow End by Glenn Brown, one of 40 artists\u2019 images that will be shown each of the 40 readings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shallow End by Glenn Brown, one of 40 artists\u2019 images that will be shown each of the 40 readings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first modern work of literature to address the idea of isolation, in the most intense and visceral and scary, but yet strangely uplifting way,\u201d said Hoare. \u201cThe Mariner\u2019s cri de c\u0153ur of \u2018alone, alone\u2019 is part of us now.\u201d</p> <p>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is \u201ca founding fable of our modern age\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are the wedding guests, and the albatross around the Mariner\u2019s neck is an emblem of human despair and our abuse of the natural world. Yet in its beautiful terror there lies a wondrous solution: that we might wake up and find ourselves saved.\u201d</p> <p>Hoare is curating the project with artist Angela Cockayne and Sarah Chapman, director of the Arts Institute. The three previously worked together on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/15/moby-dick-captures-stars-big-read\">Moby-Dick Big Read</a>, which saw figures including David Cameron and Stephen Fry join forces to read the entire novel aloud. It has gathered more 10m hits since first being broadcast in 2013.</p> <p>Other contributors to the Coleridge read will include Hilary Mantel and Lemn Sissay, each chosen because they have a backstory that reacts with the poem, said Hoare.</p> <p>Iggy Pop, for example, delivered a \u201croaring, graphic, growling\u201d reading: \u201cHe is the modern Ancient Mariner. He even looks like he\u2019s been on a raft in the Pacific for six months. And he brings his own story \u2013 let\u2019s face it, he had his own drug issues, as Coleridge did.\u201d More major names will be revealed as the project progresses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8caec9385117579f4e409601ed3d65a560f56710\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8caec9385117579f4e409601ed3d65a560f56710/87_62_1850_1850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medusa West by Yinka Shonibare, another of the artworks in the project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medusa West by Yinka Shonibare, another of the artworks in the project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yinka Shonibare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The readings will be accompanied with work by artists including Yinka Shonibare, and paired with relevant scientific research in fields including marine science and climate breakdown. Once the poem is complete, it will be accompanied by a soundscape from electronic musician Jay Auborn, featuring field recordings of albatrosses and creaking ice from the Antarctic.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough written 200 years ago, the Mariner is more pertinent than ever, forewarning us at our own peril about the abuse of nature, and how we are all interconnected,\u201d said Cockayne, a lecturer at Bath Spa University.</p> <p>She pointed to the \u201cprophetic but eternally hopeful\u201d ending to the poem, later used in the well-known hymn, in which the Mariner advises the Wedding Guest: \u201cHe prayeth well, who loveth well / Both man and bird and beast. // He prayeth best, who loveth best / All things both great and small.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis contemporary voyage draws together a talented interdisciplinary crew, working in film, photography, drawing, painting, and sculpture,\u201d said Cockayne. \u201cThe outcome is breathtaking, a circular journey of loss, grief and retribution but also one of hope for our troubled times.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is possible that the first foreign words I learned were Kalashnikov (better known as the AK-47) and Antonov. They signify what it means to be born in the midst of a war.</p> <p>The Kalashnikov is infamous across the world. The Antonov was Khartoum\u2019s deadliest weapon during the war with the country that is now known as South Sudan. The Sudan airforce turned the Russian-made plane into an \u201cangel\u201d of death, spitting fire from the skies. The plane would carry out indiscriminate aerial bombings that cut down trees, demolished buildings, and disfigured and killed people. From the children to the chickens, we became familiar with the cries of the Antonov.</p> <p>The chickens, my mother said, sounded the first alarm that danger was approaching. They became restless, clucking noisily, flapping their wings and running aimlessly. I knew then, mum stressed, it was time. \u201cI\u2019ll begin herding the children into the foxholes.\u201d Foxholes were deep holes in the ground to provide protection from the aerial bombings. The one we had in our compound was covered with wood and iron sheets for extra protection. But it was never a complete protection. If the bomb landed close to the foxhole, it would bury everyone in it alive. If it landed on top of it, that was it: \u201cThere was nothing left to bury.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/i-thought-i-was-coping-in-isolation-but-this-week-something-in-me-snapped\">I thought I was coping in isolation but this week something in me snapped | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was no warning, beside the chickens, of when the Antonov came. You lived with the frightening certainty that it would come but didn\u2019t know when or the destruction it would leave behind. That sense of uncertainty and unease is the essence of the experience of war and displacement. Most refugees of war-torn South Sudan woke up one day and found their lives changed forever. And over time, they watched the abnormal becoming normal: families torn apart and eventually becoming strangers; parents losing children too young to die, or watching them slowly and pitifully wither away in refugee camps; and gradually, after fleeing from one country to another, forgetting the feeling of home.</p> <p>Until recently, many people living here in Australia could not imagine how life can change so quickly. How life can go from normal to fighting over toilet paper.</p> <p>Now that we are faced with a world that has changed drastically in a short period of time \u2013 just like wars abruptly uproot lives \u2013 I wonder if people are comparing their somewhat more challenging, less comfortable circumstances with those whose lives are very much harder and more frightening. Perhaps, when faced with a level of pain, we are better able to value our privilege. It is also helpful to learn from others and from history. To know that, in comparison, ours is not the greatest suffering. That history repeats itself and far worse has happened. However, as individuals, we experience events immediately and personally. For people who have lost, and those who will lose, a loved one to the coronavirus, no amount of contextualising will make it easier to bear. It will be devastatingly personal. Mark Twain wrote that: \u201cNothing that grieves us can be called little: by the eternal laws of proportion a child\u2019s loss of a doll and a king\u2019s loss of a crown are events of the same size.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping in mind both the personal and the contextual during this pandemic can be beneficial, as experts sound the alarm about the emotional footprint this virus will leave behind. That speaks to the challenge still ahead and the work many, if not all, of us will have to undertake to find meaning and value while the normal things we relied on, like having a job and easy connection to family and friends, are no longer guaranteed. To balance the global and the personal requires acceptance of the fact that no matter our past suffering or current privilege, no one is exempt from the act of living life as it presents itself. We experience it, each of us, essentially on our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/i-was-born-anxious-so-why-am-i-not-panicking-about-coronavirus\">I was born anxious, but I'm coping with coronavirus \u2013 here's why | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No matter how relatively privileged we undoubtedly are to be living in Australia, there is only so many times you can tell yourself \u201cI am so lucky\u201d before it is no longer a useful coping tool. It takes you far, just not all the way. So what I am suggesting is a pause. A pause to acknowledge that things have changed and that it hurts, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. A pause long enough to allow you to gauge your ability to be resilient. That is, to allow time to look, without judgment, whether our well of resilience is running dry because, in my experience, resilience is a finite internal resource. Checking into oneself without judgment allows us to take a true account of how we\u2019re coping and if/how we need to replenish that well. To know when we need to call a friend, when we need to go for a walk, when we need to clear our mind, perhaps even when we need to cry.</p> <p>By paying attention to the world and the wider society, we can practise empathy, which is also a source of replenishment. We can practise kindness. We can look to the world, thankful for our relative good fortune, without discounting our personal journey through this global upheaval.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nyadol Nyuon is a lawyer at Arnold Bloch Leibler</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

Last week, former Australia captain Allan Border suggested the tournament should only proceed once fans are allowed into stadiums.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that to happen, absolutely not, you want the fans there,\u201d Carey said. \u201cThey play a very big part in our sport and without the fans we wouldn\u2019t have a job.

If it doesn\u2019t go ahead, it\u2019s going to be disappointing for myself and a lot of other people who would love to watch the T20 World Cup. The women\u2019s event was so successful; seeing 90,000 people at the MCG is an amazing spectacle.

Vallance did not question the importance of finding a vaccine. But he did at least twice stress that finding one might take time. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First of all, we\u2019ve got to get a vaccine. That isn\u2019t two days away, it\u2019s not two months away. Making a vaccine is a difficult, complicated process. It doesn\u2019t only have to work, it has to be safe, and of course for a disease like this it has to be very safe if you are going to use it right across the population. So there is a lot to do before we\u2019re in that position.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just to put some realism on vaccine development, each single project does not have a high probability of success.</p> \n   <p>So although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it\u2019s never the case that you know you\u2019ve got a vaccine that\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s the first thing that we need to be sure of. </p> \n   <p>The second thing is then the safety and it\u2019s incredibly important that these vaccines are tested properly, that\u2019s why it takes some time to get to the clinical trials and understand the potential unwanted effects of a vaccine.</p> \n   <p>And then only when that has been done can this be used widely across the population and so those are the stages we need to go through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that government advisers would decide on Tuesday next week whether to recommend a change of policy on face masks.</strong> At the moment the government does not advise members of the public to wear them. Vallance said this was in line with World Health Organisation recommendations. But Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said that people on public transport should be advised to wear them (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad#block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad\"> 7.53am)</a> and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he thinks a change in policy is inevitable.

I would like to talk to the government on that, because I don\u2019t want to set up rival strategies or rival theories going forward. But it would be sensible. This is why we need to start talking about the exit strategy or the exit plan \u2013 so that we can have exactly that kind of discussion, challenge, agreement, if we can reach agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He criticised the government for refusing to discuss what its exit plan from the lockdown might be. </strong>He has been calling for the government to publish a plan. Ministers claim this would distract public attention from the need to follow the lockdown rules now. But Starmer dismissed that argument. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In other countries across Europe governments are openly talking about the exit plan. I don\u2019t think the British are uniquely unable to understand the difference between lockdown and what comes next \u2026<br></p> \n   <p>Just parking this question, and saying we are not even going to look at it for another few weeks, I think is just fundamentally wrong.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he wanted Labour to be in a position where it could support the government\u2019s exit plan. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I really want, when I\u2019ve seen the plan, is to come in behind it, because we want the trust of the public.

This is, however, still more than twice as bad as the worst of the financial crisis.</p> \n   <p>More encouraging is timelier data based on the frequency of web searches for unemployment-related terms which has closely matched the path of UC claims in recent weeks. Web searches have now fallen back to close to levels seen on average during 2019. This suggests new UC claimants will fall again next week.

When<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\"> it was originally announced</a> it was open for a period of three months, until the end of May.</p> \n  <p>Now it will be extended for a month. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-to-end-of-june\">a press notice</a> the Treasury said this decision was being announced in the light of the decision yesterday to extend the lockdown for at least three weeks. It will now be open until the end of June, \u201cproviding businesses with the certainty they need\u201d, the Treasury says.</p> \n  <p>In a statement Sunak said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide job retention scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity.</p> \n   <p>It is vital for people\u2019s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March.</p> \n  <p>Even thought a one-month extension may not sound like something hugely significant, this amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury \u00a310bn or more. That is because the scheme itself amounts to a colossal public spending commitment. The Resolution Foundation has estimated that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\"> it will cost the government between \u00a330bn and \u00a340bn every three months.</a></p> \n  <p>This is one reason why the Treasury is so keen for the lockdown not to last too long.

It establishes clearly that the PM\u2019s colleagues were not being fully truthful about how ill he really was in the days before his admission to intensive care. Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">and self-isolating</a> with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. [Matt] Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d.</p> \n   <p>In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d</a>. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert.</p> \n   <p>The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes.</p> \n   <p>At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday.</p> \n   <p>It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.)</p> \n   <p>On Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">got significantly worse</a>. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street.</p> \n   <p>At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/global-leaders-send-messages-of-support-to-boris-johnson\">sent him good wishes</a>.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9982698f0895d83068fd07#block-5e9982698f0895d83068fd07\">11.19am.)</a></p> \n  <p>Hunt also said he thought the government should also involve councils in contact-tracing, the process that involves contacting people who have been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.

The health secretary today said that he hadn\u2019t decided whether it was going to be done centrally or with local government and I think one of the lessons we could reasonable draw from the slowness of ramping things up centrally is that this is something we should trust local government to help us with when we move out of the lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt said in South Korea 1,000 people were involved in contract tracing. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This could be tested out in places like Yorkshire or Cornwall because those are parts of the country which have got relatively few Covid cases - and so we could start seeing whether it was possible to lift the lockdown by replacing it with this testing and contact tracing.

  "<p> An Uber driver has died from Covid-19 after trying to hide his illness for fear that he would be evicted if his landlord found out, a friend has revealed.</p> \n<p>Rajesh Jayaseelan, a married father of two who came to London from India about a decade ago, died alone in Northwick Park hospital in Harrow on 11 April, according to Sunil Kumar, a friend of his.</p> \n<p>The 44-year-old driver had \u201cstarved\u201d for several days in his rented lodgings, telling his wife by phone that he did not want to leave his room because other residents might realise he had Covid-19 and he would be thrown out.</p> \n<p>Kumar, 38, an NHS IT worker, said the fear was founded in an experience in March when a previous landlord allegedly ordered him to leave because he thought Jayaseelan, as a minicab driver, would spread the disease to him and his family. Jayaseelan had to sleep in his car for several nights.</p> \n<p>By the time he drove himself to hospital earlier this month, his condition was becoming critical and he was placed on a ventilator. He died shortly after his wife and mother in Bangalore saw him unconscious in a final video call arranged by Kumar.</p> \n<p>Jayaseelan is the third Uber driver confirmed to have died from Covid-19 in the capital, but there have been reports of several more. Zeeshan Ahmed, a father of two young children in his late 20s, died in St George\u2019s Hospital in Tooting on Thursday.

Abdurzak Hadi, another driver who fell seriously ill, said the lack of clear guidelines and protection for minicab drivers left them highly vulnerable.</p> \n<p>Some have improvised plastic barriers between the front and back seats, but many have not, concerned that doing so might breach their licence, Hadi said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe think that there have been at least six deaths of minicab drivers and there have been countless numbers ill, some critically,\u201d said Yaseen Aslam, general secretary of the United Private Hire Drivers\u2019 Association. \u201cIt is very distressing. The migrant workers in particular are vulnerable because they feel forced to work because they are not entitled to government benefits.\u201d</p> \n<p>Uber confirmed the deaths of Akhtar and Jayaseelan, saying it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d. The Guardian has asked for comment about Ahmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur hearts go out to their loved ones and to everyone suffering during this unprecedented time,\u201d said Jamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe.</p> \n<p>Uber last month said it would compensate drivers with up to \u00a3100 per week for up to 14 days if they were diagnosed with Covid-19, placed in quarantine or asked to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>Kumar said Jayaseelan came from poverty and had hoped to move his family to London but could not yet afford to. He would travel to Bangalore to see his mother, wife and children, aged four and six, for two months each year.

  "<p>The news that flights are being chartered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/romanian-fruit-pickers-flown-uk-crisis-farming-sector-coronavirus\">to bring seasonal workers over for the UK\u2019s farming industry</a> comes as no surprise to those of us with experience in the sector, and as things stand, it won\u2019t be the last year that this happens.</p> <p>With extra pressure being placed on the agriculture sector by the dual effects of Brexit and Covid-19, there have been calls to use the large numbers of people who have either been furloughed, or lost their jobs, to fill the gaps left by the decrease in seasonal workers. Even as a temporary solution to make sure this year\u2019s harvest doesn\u2019t go unpicked, this is unlikely to work, because contrary to what many might think, this is not an \u201cunskilled\u201d job. And looking beyond this very strange year, this is going to be a problem that only becomes more severe from 2021, when post-Brexit immigration rules come into force.</p> <p>There have been a lot of people inquiring about doing this work in recent months, with large job sites reporting increased interest in fruit-picking jobs, farm labouring, and so on, and no doubt some of the 70,000 seasonal workers we need will come from this. The majority of this interest goes no further thanthe inquiry stage, though, and there are many reasons for this.</p> <p>To point out the obvious, it\u2019s an incredibly physical job. Having worked as a fruit-picker for years, I can tell you that it\u2019s certainly not (as some television ads imply) wandering calmly through a field or orchard, casually selecting an apple or a cauliflower. You have to work quickly, carrying heavy bags of apples, or bent over picking strawberries, and, other than lunchtime, without the luxury of the familiar coffee break or chat in the kitchen with a colleague.</p> <p>Every person has a quota, and in many places you\u2019re only paid by how much work you get done. There\u2019s a minimum wage, true, but if you don\u2019t hit the targets repeatedly you\u2019re likely to lose your job, and to meet those targets you have to work at full speed, all day. Even as a 19-year-old, by the time it got to Thursday afternoon the thought of having to do it all again the next day was difficult. The idea that these jobs could be filled by people who\u2019ve spent most of their lives working in offices is not realistic, and many would be asked to leave fairly quickly.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a lot to think about while you\u2019re harvesting fruit, it\u2019s not as simple as walking along and collecting everything in your path. When picking apples, you need to consider the size, the colour, whether they\u2019re damaged, how firm they are (different for each variety) \u2013 and making sure that you don\u2019t accidentally pick the pollinator tree with a different variety on it, thereby ruining the entire box of fruit. Pick poor-quality fruit, and it won\u2019t count towards your pay.</p> <p>The issue isn\u2019t just money, though. These jobs simply wouldn\u2019t work for many people. They\u2019re located in specific regions, generally far from major towns and transport links. For those who don\u2019t drive or live in those areas, that means finding accommodation. Some farms provide this for seasonal workers, but it would need serious adaptation for social-distancing rules, and not everyone would be happy with the conditions. It\u2019s also not free, so people already paying rent or a mortgage on their home would be paying twice.</p> <p>Work starts early in the morning, which equally won\u2019t suit many. This is not about British workers being lazy, as some commentators are fond of implying. If you have to take your children to school for 8:30am, then a job that starts at 7am isn\u2019t practical. The seasonal nature of the work would also be a problem for many people. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/brexit-food-farms-agriculture-supermarkets-small-producers\">How to prevent a Brexit food crisis? Dig deep for fair pay on farms | Felicity Lawrence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For these reasons, and many others, we are always going to need seasonal workers in this country, many of them from abroad. They should be welcomed, and valued, as specialised key workers without whom we would be paying far more for our fresh produce.

While turning out its bacon naan roll from your dwindling store cupboard may be a step too far, its kejriwal is within grasp. A tip from Dishoom: \u201cThe most convenient way of finishing the eggs here is to use a frying pan that can go into the oven. If you don\u2019t have one, fry the eggs until cooked in the pan, then top with the cheese, spring onions, chilli and pepper.\u201d The cheese won\u2019t melt as much, but at this point, who is splitting hairs? Add a good dollop of ketchup and your own tailor-made soundtrack, \u00e0 la Dishoom.</p> <p>Serves<strong> 1</strong></p> <p><strong>80g mature cheddar, </strong>grated<br><strong>1 or 2 thick slices </strong><strong>white bloomer, sourdough or brioche</strong> (depending on size and level of hunger)<br><strong>2 spring onions,</strong> chopped<br><strong>1 green chilli, </strong>very finely chopped<br><strong>1 tsp vegetable oi</strong>l (optional)<br><strong>1 or 2 large eggs</strong> (one for each slice of toast)<br><strong>Coarsely ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>To serve<em><br></em><strong>Tomato ketchup</strong></p> <p>Let the grated cheese come up to room temperature; it needs to be quite soft and workable. Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/gas mark 9 and put in a baking tray to warm up.</p> <p>Toast the bread until very lightly browned on both sides, then set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the topping.</p> <p>Set aside a small handful of grated cheese (roughly 10g), a teaspoon of chopped spring onion and a pinch of green chilli, to be used when you fry the egg(s).</p> <p>Crack the egg(s) into a cup or small bowl, being careful to keep the yolk(s) intact.</p> <p>Put the remaining cheese, spring onions and chilli in a bowl, add plenty of black pepper and mix well. Using the back of a spoon (or your fingers), work the cheese mixture into a paste by pressing it firmly into the sides of the bowl.</p> <p>Spread the cheese mix evenly over the toast and press it in, using the back of the spoon, to create a firm, even layer that goes all the way to the edges of the toast. Place on the tray in the oven and cook for six to eight minutes, until deep golden and bubbling.</p> <p>While the chilli cheese toast is cooking, warm a frying pan over a high heat and, if using, add the oil. Gently tip the egg(s) into the hot pan and add some black pepper. Top with the reserved grated cheese, spring onion and green chilli. Place the frying pan in the oven and cook for two minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the egg white(s) are cooked but the yolk(s) are still runny.</p> <p>Carefully slide the egg(s) on to the cheese on toast and serve right away, with plenty of ketchup.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recipe from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dishoom-9781408890677.html\">Dishoom</a> by Shamil Thakrar, Kavi Thakrar &amp; Naved Nasir (Bloomsbury, \u00a326)</em></p> <h2><strong>The Quality Chop House\u2019s confit potatoes</strong></h2> <p>Few things have the ability to cosset and hug quite like these carby cuboids from the <a href=\"https://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House</a>.

Happily, Gill has released her first cookbook, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pastry-chef-s-guide-9781911641513.html\">The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide</a>, which includes a recipe for crumbly chocolate biscuits, which Gill recommends sandwiching together with a filling of mascarpone mixed with white chocolate and a touch of sea salt. However, they are equally good as they are.</p> <p>This dough is a bit sticky to work with, but worth it for the intense chocolate flavour and gorgeously crumbly texture.</p> <p>Makes<strong> 35</strong></p> <p><strong>225g unsalted butter, </strong>softened<strong><br>150g caster (superfine) sugar<br>240g plain flour<br>80g cocoa powder<br>\u00bc tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>\u00bc large pinch fine salt<br>2 \u00bd tbsp golden syrup</strong></p> <p>Put the butter and sugar in a stand mixer or large bowl. Cream together using the paddle attachment or a handheld electric whisk until well combined with no lumps.</p> <p>Mix the dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate and salt) in a separate bowl. Add these to the butter mixture and mix until a loose dough starts to form.</p> <p>Add the golden syrup and mix until the dough comes together. Remove the dough and pat into a flat shape. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least two hours.</p> <p>Remove the plastic and knead the dough through briefly. Roll it out between two sheets of baking paper to a thickness of about 4mm. Transfer to a baking sheet on the paper and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Stamp out rounds using a cutter of your choice (the dough makes 35 biscuits using a 7cm fluted cutter). Use a palette knife to slide the biscuits back on to two new baking sheets covered with baking paper, slightly spaced out (they won\u2019t grow much) and chill again for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas mark 4. Bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes, until dry to the touch. Leave to cool completely on the baking sheet and eat them as they are or sandwich together with a filling; I like mascarpone mixed with white chocolate and a touch of sea salt. The baked biscuits will keep in an airtight container for up to two weeks. Once any filling has been added, they are best eaten on the same day.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recipe from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pastry-chef-s-guide-9781911641513.html\">The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide </a>by Ravneet Gill (Pavilion, \u00a318.99)</em></p> <h2><strong>Ducksoup\u2019s mozzarella, borlotti and wild garlic green sauce</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e365eeb9074bb8796c61523624b5c758f5b6d94b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e365eeb9074bb8796c61523624b5c758f5b6d94b/0_685_2940_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ducksoup\u2019s mozzarella, borlotti and wild garlic green sauce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ducksoup\u2019s mozzarella, borlotti and wild garlic green sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Are you craving for a night perched on a stool at <a href=\"https://www.ducksoupsoho.co.uk/\">Ducksoup</a>, in central London, with a glass of natural wine in hand and pared-back plates inspired by Italian, Middle Eastern and Nordic flavours in front of you?

Cut the cauliflower into quarters, then cut each quarter in half, so you have eight wedges of cauliflower.</p> <p>Heat the rapeseed oil in a large frying pan and fry four pieces of cauliflower on each side until golden brown. Remove from pan and repeat with the remaining four pieces. Put the cauliflower in a large bowl, pour in the olive oil and garam masala, toss to ensure a good coating on all sides, then tip the cauliflower on to a large roasting tray and bake for eight to 10 minutes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, combine the yoghurt and pomegranate molasses in a small bowl, season with salt and set aside.</p> <p>Spread a tablespoon of harissa over the base of each serving plate, then place a couple of wedges of cauliflower on top of that.

When Asma Khan, who appeared in the Netflix documentary series <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2019/3/1/18240116/chefs-table-asma-khan-season-6-episode-3\">Chef\u2019s Table</a>, was growing up in India in the 70s and 80s, these chicken drumsticks were served at gatherings. While gatherings are off the cards, if you\u2019re cooking for your family (or particularly hungry), you need to adopt the \u201cGoldilocks Rule\u201d, says Khan: \u201cYou want the drumsticks to be neither too fat, not too thin. Ideally, they should all be medium so they cook through evenly without drying out.\u201d</p> <p>Serves<strong> 2</strong></p> <p><strong>4 medium skinless drumsticks </strong>(approximately 500g)<strong><br>Lemon wedges</strong>,<strong> </strong>to serve</p> <p>For the marinade <em><strong><br></strong></em><strong>2 tbsp light soy sauce <br>1 tbsp lemon juice <br>\u00bd tbsp ground coriander <br>\u00bc tsp chilli powder (</strong>replace with paprika for a milder heat) <strong><br>A large pinch of sugar<br>1 tbsp fresh ginger paste<br>1 tbsp garlic paste</strong></p> <p>In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the marinade. Place the chicken drumsticks in a non-reactive container with a lid and pour over the marinade, making sure every surface of the chicken is covered. Cover the container and refrigerate for at least six hours, and preferably overnight.</p> <p>Take the chicken out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature. These kababs can be cooked either in an oven or on a barbecue.</p> <p>If cooking in an oven, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas mark 6. Place the drumsticks on an oven tray in a single layer to allow them to cook evenly and pour over any remaining marinade. Bake for 20\u201325 minutes, then use a sharp knife or skewer to pierce the thickest part of the drumstick to check whether the juices run clear; if not, return to the oven. When cooked, the drumsticks should be speckled with brown patches, but the meat should not be dry.</p> <p>If cooking on a barbecue, wait until any flames have subsided and a low heat is evenly spread across the coals (if the heat is too high, the outsides of the drumsticks will cook quickly but the insides will still be raw). The cooking time will vary depending on the heat of the coals. Before serving, using a sharp knife or skewer, pierce the thickest part of the drumstick to check whether the juices run clear.</p> <p>Serve the kababs while warm, with lemon wedges to squeeze over.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recipe from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/asma-s-indian-kitchen-9781911595687.html\">Asma\u2019s Indian Kitchen</a>: Home-cooked food brought to you by Darjeeling Express by Asma Khan (Pavilion, \u00a320)</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.morito.co.uk/\">Morito</a>\u2019s beetroot borani</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04110dcffd1c6cb85dcafad3293f8563039763a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04110dcffd1c6cb85dcafad3293f8563039763a7/489_0_2001_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morito\u2019s beetroot borani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morito\u2019s beetroot borani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conveyor belt of cooking and washing-up is unrelenting, so you would be forgiven for solely living on traybakes.

  "<p>Safety investigators have launched an inquiry into the death of a visually impaired man struck by a train after falling from a station platform.</p> <p>According to the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, the platform was not equipped with a tactile surface, a safety feature designed to warn people with poor vision when they are approaching the edge.</p> <p>The incident occurred at a Southeastern commuter station, Eden Park, near Bromley, on the border of south-east London and Kent.</p> <p>The RAIB said the unnamed man was struck almost immediately after falling from the platform just after 7pm on the evening of 26 February. Although paramedics were called, he died at the scene.</p> <p>The train that struck him was travelling to London Charing Cross from Kent. Witnesses told reporters at the time that he may have been confused by the sound of a train arriving at an adjacent platform, and mistakenly walked into the path of the train on his platform before it had stopped.</p> <p> They said the train on the opposite platform had arrived moments before, and had sounded signals that its doors were opening, possibly leading the man to believe his train was ready to board.</p> <p>The inquiry will attempt to identify the sequence of events leading up to the accident, and will look into whether tactile surfaces could have helped prevent it. The safety features are widespread on platforms but not mandatory.</p> <p>A spokesman for Southeastern and Network Rail said: \u201cWe are fully co-operating with the RAIB investigation regarding the death of a man at Eden Park station on February 26, and we appreciate the efforts of all the emergency services and our staff who attended this tragic incident.

Only once these issues have been addressed should we consider performing elective surgery that cannot be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAn additional measure that will ensure the safety of healthcare workers and patients would see a defined perioperative quarantine period of 14 days prior to surgery. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public have made a concerted effort to socially isolate and reduce transmission of Covid-19 in our community and in our healthcare system.

  "<p>I wasn\u2019t much of a reader as a kid. Books and words required far too much attention; I was much happier laid out dribbling mindlessly on the sofa watching cartoons, gameshows and endlessly flicking channels.</p> <p>As much as my concerned family and frustrated teachers tried to press me into reading, nothing seemed to stick. Thankfully, though, my friends and I became obsessed with one particular series of books: The Edge Chronicles by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell. First published in 1998, the illustrated fantasy saga of sky pirates and floating citadels is still being published, currently totalling 18 volumes. I was drawn in by Riddell\u2019s incredibly detailed drawings of bulbous, grotesque goblins and lithe, shifty men, all inhabiting this radical sky-bound universe, then hooked on Stewart\u2019s fast-moving prose and action-packed narratives.</p> <p>Going back to the books for the first time in almost 20 years, I was sceptical. The intervening decades have seen me keep up my love of TV \u2013 namely in my role at the Guardian \u2013 but also move forward in my taste for books, which became an equally enduring passion. After university courses stacked with postmodernism, postcolonialism, structuralism and all the other \u201cisms\u201d, I had been sucked into the allure of the weighty, \u201cdifficult\u201d tome; books you read not just for pleasure but to say that you\u2019ve read. Surely a children\u2019s book now would be too easy and too boring?</p> <p>Picking up the first book, the 439-page Curse of the Gloamglozer, the drawings were just as vivid as I remembered, beginning with the Hieronymus Bosch-levels of detail in the levitating city of Sanctaphrax. And then I got stuck. There are so many characters with obscure names to remember: Quint, Wind Jackal, Ice Fox, Linius Pallitax, Ramrock, Queep, in the opening pages alone. How did I keep track of all these as a 10-year-old? I had skimmed over the introduction which explains why these sky pirates exist (I was too distracted by the drawings) so now I had no idea why one ship was fighting another and why there were goblin slaves onboard.

TV fills in all gaps, but books give the mind ample space to roam. I was hooked, too, on the young apprentice Quint\u2019s quest to find out what had been plaguing his master Linius, and his developing relationship with the young Maris. I read all 439 pages in a day, desperate to know the ending.</p> <p>We are understandably all looking for means of escape in these panic-fuelled times. Reading this volume of The Edge Chronicles, I remembered what reading purely for pleasure felt like. What it was to lose yourself in a text, not for its stylistic intricacies or knowing commentary on the world, but for its imaginative capacity to be pure entertainment. It was the feeling of reading purely for yourself. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll be looking out for in my next read \u2013 perhaps the next 17 volumes of the Chronicles?</p>",

  "<p>In Ernest Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises, Mike Campbell is asked how he went bankrupt. \u201cTwo ways,\u201d he replies. \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201d</p> <p>Mike is Scottish, which is something else we have in common.</p> <p>The other thing? His way with words. Of course. And then there\u2019s his way with money.</p> <p>I am not bankrupt \u2013 not yet \u2013 but on top of everything else that the coronavirus pandemic has brought me, there is the almost complete ruin of my finances which are now, to use a technical term, completely screwed. In the words of the brilliant country singer Brandy Clark: <em>If we had a penny we sure couldn\u2019t spare it / Sitting on the porch drinking generic Coke / We\u2019re broke.</em></p> <p>I am in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/millions-having-to-choose-between-paying-landlord-or-eating-research-suggests-coronavirus\">rent arrears</a> for the first time in my life. I owe thousands of pounds to family and friends. My <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/covid-19-pay-freezes-on-uk-loans-and-credit-cards-start-today\">credit card</a> is maxed out as I\u2019ve missed too many minimum payments. Direct debits bounce from my bank account like an orgy on a trampoline. Every time I go to the supermarket, which is not as often as it should be, I prepare my \u201cbemused and slightly irate\u201d face in the event of my card being declined. When the card isn\u2019t declined, I conceal my teary relief behind a mask of nonchalance. After All This is over, I\u2019ll have a credit score worse than Venezuela\u2019s.</p> <p>As much as I am grateful for the revival of the lost art of the telephone call, the renewed connection with old friends, the opportunity to make amends and put past enmities behind me, and the discovery of my heretofore unexplored talent to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/28/20-best-egg-recipes-part-1-simon-hopkinson-elizabeth-david-omelette-tortilla\">cook eggs</a> eight ways, I nevertheless find myself sceptical of the cost-benefit analysis. After marvelling that I\u2019ve found eggs to cook with, I mean.</p> <p>My finances BC (before Covid-19) were already something of a fragile ecosystem. I left a career in journalism \u2013 or perhaps it left me, it\u2019s hard to say \u2013 to become a scriptwriter. It was going OK: after three years as a storyliner on Coronation Street and Emmerdale, I got my first script commission in 2017. Since then, I\u2019ve been beavering away on various projects, and scraping a living. But that was the deal. I knew that from the get-go. I accepted that, at least for a while, I\u2019d have a lemonade lifestyle on a lemonade wage.</p> <p>I was almost, nearly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/08/just-about-managing-austerity-brexit-public-spending-cuts\">just about managing</a> \u2013 not least because there was hope. Hope that a show I\u2019ve written \u2013 about the teenage children of the super-rich, ironically enough \u2013 might get a green light. Hope that other ideas might get put into development somewhere. Hope that I might get into a writers\u2019 room on someone else\u2019s show. Hope that a play I\u2019ve written might catch the eye of a theatre. Now though, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-support-loophole-uk-film-tv-staff-without-pay-mps\">TV production</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-prompts-more-cultural-institutions-to-shut-doors\">theatre</a> are in short supply. Hope is in short supply. They say that it\u2019s the hope that kills you in the end. I\u2019d say that despair is also pretty lethal. Just when you\u2019re making ends meet, someone moves the ends.</p> <p>These are not unfamiliar circumstances for me. I grew up in the 1980s in a single-parent household with very little money. One of my most vivid childhood memories is of my mum having to choose what to buy with what was left of her family allowance (as it was then). A pint of milk or a loaf of bread? My feelings now are similar to my feelings then when I knew that my friends were much better off than we were. Embarrassment, envy, anger and sadness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/covid-19-jobs-wipeout-young-low-earners-hardest-hit\">Having no money</a> is humiliating, frustrating, infantilising. It erodes your self-worth in a very particular way. It is stealthy and vicious. I feel pathetic and I feel ashamed.

Like Theofelus, she didn\u2019t rise through party political ranks but rather was appointed for the skills she could bring to the portfolio. This is especially unusual in southern Africa, where the credentials of the older liberation war heroes, born of struggle, often weigh more heavily than educational qualifications.</p> <p>The same was true for Vera Daves da Sousa, 35, who became Angola\u2019s finance minister last year. She is now tasked with reviving an oil-based economy suffering its worst recession since civil war ended in 2002.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7232bd7947375c5b4009efaaa08225faa040391\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7232bd7947375c5b4009efaaa08225faa040391/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angola\u2019s finance minister, Vera Daves de Sousa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angola\u2019s finance minister, Vera Daves de Sousa, has inherited a tough economic situation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Angola Ministry of Finance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the past decade regional powerhouse South Africa has welcomed a larger number of younger cabinet members, too. For example, last year Ronald Lamola, 35 and a lawyer by training, was appointed justice minister. He rose to prominence a decade ago as part of the youth league of the governing African National Congress (ANC), where he was a close ally of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/10/julius-malema-south-africa-anc\">Julius Malema</a>, one of the most prominent young African politicians in recent times. They went their separate ways after Malema was expelled and formed his own party.</p> <p>In the past month, Lamola has been part of a team consisting of mostly older ministers regulating South Africa\u2019s tight coronavirus lockdown. In an unprecedented move by the president, another young colleague, communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, was this week ordered to take leave for breaking these rules after she was pictured on social media having lunch at a friend\u2019s house. Ndabeni-Abrahams, also from the ANC Youth League, was 33 when she became deputy minister in 2011.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d4667970b5c39c681bca2b8a9a17672392e411f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4667970b5c39c681bca2b8a9a17672392e411f/0_0_4230_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, South Africa\u2019s communications minister\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, right, South Africa\u2019s communications minister, has been accused of violating the country\u2019s lockdown order.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodger Bosch/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is in South Africa\u2019s national legislature where the ages are truly dipping. The ANC\u2019s Itumeleng Ntsube made history by becoming the youngest member of parliament in the country\u2019s history after last year\u2019s general elections. Ntsube, aged 20 at the time, was joined by at least four former student activists who made names for themselves a couple of years earlier in the #FeesMustFall protest movement.</p> <p>Across the border in Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe clung to power until the age of 93, former Olympian swimmer Kirsty Coventry, then 35, was appointed minister of youth, sport, arts and recreation in 2018 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. In the same year, Jessie Majome, from the opposition MDC Alliance, became the youngest parliamentarian aged 25.</p> <p>Mugabe was also known for appointing young ministers, such as the firebrand youth leader Saviour Kasukuwere, who became deputy minister of youth development and employment creation in 2005 at the age of 35.</p> <p>But having young leaders in government isn\u2019t always good news. Instead of advancing youth interests, the appointment of young people as ministers in Zimbabwe \u201chas been done over the years expediently and selectively\u201d, says Harare-based Ibbo Mandaza, director of the Sapes Trust thinktank.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly done half-heartedly, because the older generation doesn\u2019t want to give up power,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also done as a way of co-opting and buying off the opposition.\u201d</p> <p>Mandaza says Coventry was appointed to woo white Zimbabweans. \u201cThere has not been a pattern of a systematic attempt for generational change in the region.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad1a87f40cfab1be5c37bda85f12eba59f4307a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1a87f40cfab1be5c37bda85f12eba59f4307a1/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zimbabwe\u2019s sports minister, Kirsty Coventry follows January\u2019s Test match between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka at Harare Sports Club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zimbabwe\u2019s sports minister, Kirsty Coventry, left, follows January\u2019s Test match between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka at Harare Sports Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some heads of state have made young appointments to compete favourably with the opposition.

  "<p>In theory, all of us are vulnerable to coronavirus, but in practice how well we fare has to do with what you could call pre-existing conditions that are not only medical but economic, social, political and racial \u2013 and the pandemic, which is also an economic catastrophe, has made these differences glaringly clear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/with-working-americans-survival-at-stake-the-us-is-bailing-out-the-richest\">With working Americans' survival at stake, the US is bailing out the richest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Age was the first factor most of us in the west heard about in the unequal impact of this virus.

This was misread as young people having nothing to worry about. Then, March was full of stories of desperately ill and dying young people as cautionary tales warning that no one was guaranteed an exemption from this.</p> <p>Perhaps the widespread attempts in recent years to try to think intersectionally \u2013 to understand how multiple factors affect each person\u2019s identity and experience \u2013 has equipped us to understand how unequally affected we are by a disease and the measures taken to limit it. For example, the shutdowns that are meant to prevent its spread have wildly varying economic impacts. Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/us-unemployment-filings-coronavirus\">suddenly</a> lost jobs. Some whose work was deemed necessary had to continue in the face of the danger of contagion \u2013 medical workers, firefighters, transport workers and food workers, from those on farms to supermarket stockers and cashiers. Some white-collar workers could work safely from home or were already based at home. Some of us are financially devastated; some are unchanged.</p> <p>In many countries and most US states people were told to stay at home. What sheltering in place means for the impoverished, overcrowded majority in some parts of the world is hard to fathom. What does a family of eight do in two rooms with a dirt floor, little food on hand and no running water? Those who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-thrive-british-jails-prisoners-face-death-sentence\">in prison</a> and other forms of detention find that lack of freedom means lack of freedom to take the necessary measures.</p> <p>Some of us did not have homes \u2013 and some cities made an unprecedented effort to find safe housing for homeless residents, some did not. San Francisco continued to try to place homeless people in shared spaces where the disease had opportunities to spread, leading to 70 residents of one impromptu shelter <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-10/70-test-positive-for-coronavirus-at-san-francisco-homeless-shelter\">testing positive for the virus</a>.

This newly intensified parenting meant very different things for two parents with one child and a single parent of three, for parents who were supposed to continue working full-time inside or outside the home and those who were suddenly out of work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some who live alone have been reporting devastating loneliness; people who live with others have reported everything from exasperation to fear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Universities that suddenly evicted their students and told them to \u201cgo home\u201d seemed to proceed on the premise that every student had a loving pair of parents in a commodious home eager to receive them. Of course, some don\u2019t have parents, others come from abusive households, or impoverished ones with no room for a sudden arrival, or no stable home, or ones in which parents are already overwhelmed or ill.</p> <p>Some who live alone have been reporting devastating loneliness; people who live with others have reported everything from exasperation to fear, including fear of roommates, partners and adolescent offspring who refused to follow the recommended protocols for avoiding contagion. Warnings are emerging about a likely wave of mental health problems from these new situations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">Domestic violence</a> has risen dramatically in many places.</p> <p>Gender assumed many roles in this pandemic. Cisgender men were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">more likely to die</a> from the virus, which seemed to be about inherent vulnerabilities of those with XY chromosomes. Anecdotally, less effective self-care, from handwashing to avoiding contact to less responsiveness to early symptoms, was said to be a factor. Women, on the other hand, had other burdens. If they live with male spouses, children, or both, they are already likely to be saddled with what sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild calls <a href=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/instructors/biblio/resources/111143\">\u201cthe second shift\u201d</a> \u2013 the housework, food preparation and childcare, all of which intensify when life takes place almost entirely at home.</p> <p>We were encouraged to start making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/face-masks-coronavirus-covid-19-public\">masks</a> at home \u2013 sewing has no inherent gender, but I have yet to see a man making masks and I\u2019ve seen many women producing everything from a few funky masks to hundreds to distribute to strangers. Masks in the US are widely understood as self-protection, while the Asian practice of people wearing masks while potentially contagious is intended to protect others. I also saw on social media someone complain that white men were refusing to wear masks with floral patterns because they were interested in protecting, first, their masculinity, and saw others note that for black men floral and festive patterns were desirable ways of defusing the racist perception of them as threatening. Other black men are afraid to wear masks at all, for fear it will heighten the racist perception of them as menacing or criminal.</p> <p>It has also become clear that health disparities due to racism increased the chances of becoming severely ill or dying. From New Orleans to Chicago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19\">black people</a> were at disproportionate risk of death. Higher levels of diabetes and hypertension can be linked to the stress of racism; asthma and respiratory problems are tied to the polluted air of many urban and industrial areas; and lack of long-term access to good medical care and food sources (due to poverty and discrimination) play their part.</p> <p>In the US, another kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/20/chinese-students-racism-coronavirus\">racism</a> blamed the virus on Chinese-Americans, Chinese immigrants or \u2013 with the usual sloppiness of racists \u2013 those who looked Asian, in some sort of ugly fantasy of collective guilt. One\u2019s ethnicity has nothing to do with whether or not one has been to China recently, and there is no biological difference in vulnerability or contagiousness. Undocumented residents were unable to access some resources and understandably reluctant to seek out others.</p> <p>Nearly everyone on Earth is, or will be, affected by this pandemic but each of us is affected differently. Some of us are financially devastated, some are gravely or fatally ill or have already died; some face racism outside the home or violence within it. The pandemic is a spotlight that illuminates underlying problems \u2013 economic inequality, racism, patriarchy. Taking care of each other begins with understanding the differences. And when the virus has slowed or stopped, all these problems will still need to be addressed. They are the chronic illnesses that weaken us as a society, morally, imaginatively, and otherwise.</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist</p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Chinese economy shrinks 6.8%</h2> \n<p>Friday is here and I\u2019m Warren Murray, ready to lead you through what\u2019s on offer in terms of news.</p> \n<p>Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-economy-shrinks-record-wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-rises-50-percent\">revised the city\u2019s death toll upwards by 50%</a> from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported toll. Meanwhile in the last few hours the business world has begun absorbing the news that the Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020. The first such contraction on record for China comes after months of paralysis from the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s biggest companies handed out almost half a trillion pounds in dividends and share buybacks in the years before the coronavirus crisis, according to a report calling for tough conditions on any taxpayer-funded bailouts. Burgeoning dividend payouts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/400bn-paid-in-dividends-by-uk-companies-before-coronavirus-crisis\">left companies weak going into the Covid-19 crash</a>, as well as fuelling inequality, says the Common Wealth thinktank. It says the government needs to take an equity stake in firms receiving financial support, while job security guarantees should be made, and ministers could also impose bans on dividends and share buybacks, insist on maximum pay caps for top executives, and get assurances that companies will pay their taxes fairly.</p> \n<p>After attempting to lord it over state governors, Donald Trump has unveiled guidelines for reopening the economy that ultimately defer to them on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">when and how restrictions should be eased within their borders</a>. The first phase allows for work but only essential travel; the second would allow for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel; the third allows for schools and organised youth activities to open up as well as large venues under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d and bars on the basis of reduced occupancy. David Smith writes that the guidelines are supposedly science-based but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trumps-science-based-reopening-strategy-is-still-full-of-unanswered-questions\">fail to set out critical elements</a> like a national testing strategy \u2013 something that has proven vital in other countries.</p> \n<p>Dominic Raab has warned the British public that lockdown measures could last into June and any relaxation now would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms\">\u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d</a>.

  "<p>Singapore, praised for its gold standard approach to tracing coronavirus cases, is facing a surge in transmission linked to its cramped migrant workers\u2019 dormitories, where thousands more infections are expected to emerge.</p> <p>The health ministry reported 728 new cases on Thursday, the biggest rise in a single day, as medical teams raced to test and isolate workers living in vast dormitory blocks.</p> <p>While Singapore <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1.full.pdf\">has been lauded</a> for its rapid and comprehensive approach to contract tracing, officials have been accused of overlooking the dormitories, where thousands of workers live in close quarters and between 12 and 20 men might share a single room.</p> <p>In March the campaign group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) <a href=\"http://twc2.org.sg/2020/03/23/straits-times-forum-employers-practices-leave-foreign-workers-vulnerable-to-infection/\">urged officials to make plans</a> to protect workers, warning: \u201cThe risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable.\u201d Authorities are resorting to moving men to multi-storey car parks, military camps and floating hotels in an attempt to reduce crowding.</p> <p>Mohan Dutta, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand, who has interviewed 45 migrant workers in Singapore since the outbreak began, said many feared an outbreak was inevitable due to the conditions.</p> <p>\u201cParticipants told me that even up until Monday they don\u2019t have access to soap and adequate cleaning supplies,\u201d he said. While migrants were being served food so that they did not use shared kitchens, the quality of meals was poor and lacking in nutrition. In some cases 100 men were sharing five toilets and five showers.</p> <p>Nine dormitories, the biggest of which holds 24,000 men, have been declared isolation units by officials, while all other buildings accommodating the city-state\u2019s 300,000 workers have been placed under effective lockdown. The restrictions, an attempt to reduce further transmission, have left the dormitories even more crowded than usual as only essential workers are permitted to leave.</p> <p>One construction worker, from Bangladesh, told the Guardian there were long queues to use shared bathrooms which often did not have enough water for the showers or toilets to function.</p> <p>No one in his dormitory had yet tested positive, he said, but some people had temperatures of 38C. \u201cIn my room and other rooms also there are many [with] symptoms, some feel [they have] no energy, someone has body aches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are frightened.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"568ef6e55e75da449eb29d39a733ca2a8a51ca5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/568ef6e55e75da449eb29d39a733ca2a8a51ca5d/0_63_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foreign workers are seen outside their dormitory rooms at Cochrane Lodge II in Singapore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foreign workers are seen outside their dormitory rooms at Cochrane Lodge II in Singapore</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government said it had increased cleaning services in the dormitories, which are usually privately operated, and was providing meals to workers and moving people to alternative accommodation.</p> <p>Professor Dale Fisher, a senior consultant in infectious diseases at Singapore\u2019s National University Hospital, said medical teams had moved from hospitals to test people on site quickly. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stop it there the hospitals will get overwhelmed.\u201d</p> <p>It was likely that thousands more cases would be discovered, Fisher said. \u201c[The men] are all 30 to 40 years old, which is good, but still when you\u2019re dealing with these massive numbers you\u2019re going to get a good number of sick 30 to 40-year-olds.</p> <p>\u201cThe risk [relating to migrant worker dormitories] is completely different and the preparation and the anticipation wasn\u2019t there.</p> <p>\u201cThe message to other places is, if you have an overcrowded setting it is just so vulnerable,\u201d Fisher said, pointing to slum areas in countries such as India. \u201cWhen people say India\u2019s shutdown has been extended \u2013 I can\u2019t think of anything other than shutting down. It\u2019s like the only defence you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>The second wave of cases in Singapore has brought the total number of infections to 4,427 including 10 deaths. Fisher said he was not aware of any fatalities among migrant worker clusters but these typically were not recorded until a later date.</p> <p>Singapore\u2019s migrant workers, who are largely from India and Bangladesh, are an essential part of the work force. Many toil for long hours on the country\u2019s construction sites, building its skyscrapers and shopping malls, so that they can send money to relatives back home.</p> <p>It is not uncommon for workers, who have temporary contracts and are dependent upon their employers for work permits, to be paid less than promised. Workers might be promised as much as S$1,200 per month, but typically receive anything between S$500-750, according to Dutta. The workers pay large sums in agency fees to work in Singapore and are often reluctant to complain for fear of being deported.</p> <p>Workers\u2019 dormitories are on the outskirts of the city-state, which, Dutta said, \u201cmakes them in many ways invisible to the landscape of Singapore\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>It was only about an hour into Sophia\u2019s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia\u2019s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.</p> <p>On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/22/us-food-industry-factory-workers-coronavirus-podcast\">'If one of us gets sick, we all get sick': the food workers on the coronavirus front line \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling<em>, \u201cVamonos, vamonos!\u201d</em> Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia\u2019s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: \u201cGod save me, God save me.\u201d When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement.</p> <p>Springdale was ill-prepared for the scale of <a href=\"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jun/27/chlorine-leak-tyson-plant-hospitalizes-several/?latest\" title=\"\">the disaster</a>. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them.</p> <p>It was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson\u2019s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals.</p> <p>The Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme \u2013 one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant \u2013 has many local priests and preachers on its payroll.</p> <p>However, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-03/u-s-chicken-industry-accused-of-conspiring-to-keep-immigrant-wages-down\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit.</p> <p>Chicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-12\" title=\"\">according to a 2017 report</a> by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency\u2019s severe violator enforcement program, which targets \u201crecalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation\u201d after a worker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region7/12172013\" title=\"\">hand was severed</a> by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker\u2019s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region6/08162016\" title=\"\">a dozen violations</a>, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alabama-carlos-lynn-decapitated-chicken-processing-plant-a9381426.html\" title=\"\">Tyson chicken plant in Alabama</a> was decapitated in an accident.</p> <p>After the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/tyson-chemical-spill-worker-injury-plant-inspection-privatization-slaughter-line-speed-usda/\" title=\"\">were hospitalised</a> after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. \u201cA contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor\u2019s use,\u201d the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Sophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape.</p> <p>While Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. \u201cI\u2019m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Sophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed.</p> <p>On 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d and must \u201cshow up and do their job\u201d. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33/0_0_3600_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Walker IV/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. \u201cI am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,\u201d she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to be, where I can feel safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn\u2019t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn\u2019t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers\u2019 rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to \u201censure that the employees had effective hazard communications training\u201d, and \u201cnot all employees understood the labelling system in the facility\u201d, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html\" title=\"\">request</a>). Although the failure was categorised as \u201cserious\u201d, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 \u2013 or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised. </p> <p>The workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. \u201cThese stories changed me for life,\u201d Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions.</p> <p>In February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson\u2019s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of <a href=\"https://www.uusc.org/press/new-arkansas-poultry-industry-report/\" title=\"\">a damning report</a> based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state \u2013 a third of whom worked for Tyson \u2013 who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line.</p> <p>The report offered a rare window into workers\u2019 experiences in one of the state\u2019s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. \u201cWe were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,\u201d Licolli recalled. \u201cTalking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>That hostile culture became even harsher after Trump\u2019s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state\u2019s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having <a href=\"https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=645\" title=\"\">sent buses</a> to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"long read email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The day after the report came out, the workers\u2019 campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson\u2019s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson\u2019s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. \u201cThey were really mad that we were taking these actions,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like they were lecturing us.\u201d</p> <p>Executives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson\u2019s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. \u201cI felt like it was the beginning of something different,\u201d she said</p> <p>A few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/poultry-workers-wear-diapers-work-bathroom-breaks\" title=\"\">which claimed</a> that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation \u2013 wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind.</p> <p>The bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson\u2019s website expressed concern about \u201cthese anonymous claims\u201d in the Oxfam report, saying that \u201cwhile we currently have no evidence they\u2019re true\u201d, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed.</p> <p>For Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. \u201cIt felt like a relief for them to have our back,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe were stronger in that moment than ever before.\u201d The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson\u2019s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: \u201cWe\u2019ve told them that while we believe we\u2019re a caring, responsible company, we\u2019re always willing to consider ways we can do better.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson\u2019s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. \u201cThere was nothing explicit,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo \u2018we are going to do this by this time\u2019 \u2026 it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.\u201d Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks.</p> <p>While Oxfam <a href=\"https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/a-big-win-for-poultry-workers/\" title=\"\">hailed the agreement</a> as a \u201cbig win\u201d on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers\u2019 delegates had been left out of the discussion. \u201cIt was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: \u2018Good for you, good for me, let\u2019s say you are a good company,\u2019\u201d Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam\u2019s request to issue a statement. \u201cI do think the company wants to change, but we\u2019re also very cautious,\u201d she <a href=\"https://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2017/04/the-new-agreement-for-poultry-workers-is-not-the-end-its-just-the-beginning/\" title=\"\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>When we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: \u201cSince the beginning of Oxfam\u2019s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers \u2026 In non-union plants [including Berry Street], Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But Licolli\u2019s caution turned out to be prescient. The workers were soon fighting a dangerous new threat to their health.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the slowdown of 2017, Tyson and the rest of the poultry industry wasted no time trying to turbo-charge chicken production. That meant resuming an old battle over production line speeds. In the last half century, poultry processors have increased line speeds from less than 100 birds per minute to 140 \u2013 the legal maximum established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Even at that rate, according to the US Government Accountability Office, workers <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688294.pdf\" title=\"\">risked injury and pain</a>, but chicken factories were <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7734f5cf-05d9-4f89-a7eb-6d85037ad2a7/17-05-Petition-National-Chicken-Council-09012017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" title=\"\">lobbying aggressively</a> to get slaughter and evisceration lines moving faster.</p> <p>In late December 2017, Licolli travelled to Washington DC with injured workers, including Sophia, to challenge the line-speed proposals, and met with officials at the USDA. For Sophia, it was a revelation. \u201cI had a voice for the first time,\u201d she recalls. Working with Licolli she had found friendship and the courage to tell her story. The following month, in a surprise move, the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA accepted their arguments and those of other workers\u2019 right groups, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/01/31/581956147/usda-denies-poultry-industrys-request-to-speed-up-the-slaughter-line\" title=\"\">turned down</a> the request to speed up chicken processing lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Villafuerte/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the next battle followed quickly. The meat and poultry industry had begun using a new weapon against bacteria in greater volumes. Peracetic acid \u2013 an antimicrobial developed for sterilising medical equipment \u2013 was found, if sprayed on carcasses, to reliably kill bacteria without leaving residue, which meant the whole process could be sped up. But, while safe for consumers, research has shown that it may carry health risks for workers. Long exposure has been shown to cause eye, skin and nose <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article-abstract/69/4/294/5420724\" title=\"\">irritations</a> to medical workers, as well as <a href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/49/2/49_2_155/_article/-char/ja/\" title=\"\">asthma</a>.</p> <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/viewpoints/antibiotic-use\" title=\"\">Tyson</a> announced plans to stop feeding human antibiotics to chickens, and began relying more heavily on antimicrobials. Jenny Leigh Houlroyd, a certified industrial hygienist and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, has been studying the use of peracetic acid in the poultry industry for years, and worries that a disaster may be slowly unfolding inside the lungs of workers. In 2018 she led a team of researchers in a pilot study of peracetic acid at four chicken plants in Georgia. During her time in the plants, workers told her about eye irritation, sore throats, headaches and sinus infections. The use of peracetic acid has been approved by the USDA and there is still no legal limit on exposure levels. With 250,000 poultry workers in the US exposed to peracetic acid, Houlroyd adds: \u201cThe industry needs to be listening to their workers. In the absence of definitive data, that is where you have to go. You have to listen to workers.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On a warm Tuesday evening in October 2019, not far from the Berry Street plant, Sophia was among two dozen or so women rearranging folding chairs into a semi-circle inside a one-room church on a Springfield strip mall. Like Sophia, the women were Latina immigrants, all of whom have worked low-wage jobs in the city\u2019s chicken plants.</p> <p>\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cOxfam sold us out.\u201d Her voice, once strong and clear, was thin and soft, barely above a whisper, and punctuated by fits of coughing.</p> <p>The women had begun meeting quietly together for some time. The Oxfam agreement had created a major rift within what, at the time, was a growing movement among poultry workers. With little change in their daily working conditions, these women felt betrayed. They decided they wouldn\u2019t rely on outsiders to negotiate for them any more.</p> <p>The previous year, Licolli, along with Sophia and other workers, had made two visits down to Immokalee, Florida, known as the nation\u2019s tomato capital, where a worker-led movement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/business/in-florida-tomato-fields-a-penny-buys-progress.html?hpw&amp;rref=us#slideshow/100000002843921/100000002843938\" title=\"\">had transformed</a> the conditions and wages for field workers, mostly poor immigrants from Latin America. The trip had been transformative for Sophia, who told me it gave her hope, for the first time, that they could bring about change within a company as powerful as Tyson.</p> <p>The Florida campaign had put workers\u2019 voices at the centre of the conversation with the brands who sourced their tomatoes in Immokalee. Licolli wondered if she could bring that model to the poultry industry. Instead of protesting, they would bring their fight to the household brands that buy Tyson chicken, such as McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, Licolli said, \u201cby alerting consumers to the injustice behind their favourite foods\u201d. But in January 2019, when Licolli brought those ideas to the board of the Northwest Arkansas Workers\u2019 Justice Center, they were rejected. \u201cI was called a radical. And it\u2019s not that I am an extremist,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut even the minimum effort of organising, it has to be radical. There is no sugar-coating our message for people to feel comfortable working with us.\u201d</p> <p>The clash over appropriate action proved irreparable, and in March, Licolli was dismissed as director of the centre. Subsequently, dozens of women, including Sophia, left. A few months later, the centre shut down. It had taken months for the women\u2019s campaign to get going again, but here they were, with their folding chairs and a new banner with a crowing rooster on it. \u201cBecause we are fighters,\u201d Licolli explained, as she went to work hanging it on the wall. On the banner was the name of their new labour organisation, Venceremos \u2013 meaning \u201cwe will win\u201d. The women spent the evening planning the public launch of the new organisation, and shared their concerns about how they would overcome the fear other workers had about organising.</p> <p>A few days later, Licolli drove up to a Springdale shopping centre for the official launch of Venceremos, where poultry workers were already waiting, having finished their day shifts at the nearby plants. She pinned up her rooster banner. The showing was better than she had hoped. Before she started, she asked all plant workers to raise their hands, and asked no one to post photos on social media from the event, fearing that Tyson might target them for retaliation. A reporter from Univision Arkansas came by, and a three-worker delegation arrived from Immokalee, including Gerardo Reyes Chavez. He believes the new workers\u2019 movement has potential. \u201cDespite all the circumstances they\u2019ve had to confront,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are really strong people, and they are trying to leave the world a better place than how the world has treated them.\u201d</p> <p>In January, workers noted increased shipments of peracetic acid to the Berry Street plant. Many workers were experiencing coughing, nose irritation and breathing problems. In mid-February, a group of 16 Venceremos workers walked into the office of a supervisor to tell them about the symptoms they were experiencing. The supervisor dismissed the idea that the chemicals were causing the symptoms, saying they sounded like the flu. However, he agreed to improve ventilation in the plant. Tyson said all employees working with chemicals were required to have training, maintain personal protective equipment, and were \u201cinstructed to report any irritations immediately to their manager\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In mid-March, with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across Arkansas, Sophia, like hundreds of other workers at the Berry Street plant, was given \u201cessential employee verification\u201d papers and told to keep them with her at all times. Sophia was deemed one of the nation\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce\" title=\"\">essential critical infrastructure</a>\u201d workers. She would be exempt from curfews, shelter-in-place orders and other mobility restrictions, so she might \u201cprovide services essential to the production of food\u201d.</p> <p>Five days a week, Sophia kept going to work on the evisceration line. Some days she woke up and felt the phantom balloon in her chest. She went to work anyway, fearful of losing a day\u2019s pay. When we spoke in March, she said there was no way to practise social distancing at the plant.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all standing close together all the time. I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s not only about the line. When we finish our shift, or we come in to start, we all come in together through the same doors. If one of us gets sick, all of us get sick.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia read news reports of the virus with growing alarm. Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home.</p> <p>Workers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tyson-foods-demand-poultry-plants-to-provide-paid-sick-days-for-their-hourly-workers?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=73fcf380-f097-012f-fc86-4040aa777426\" title=\"\">an online petition</a> demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures.</p> <p>On 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn\u2019t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy\u2019s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don\u2019t have [health insurance] coverage.\u201d The company also said: \u201cIf a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they\u2019re out.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers\u2019 temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines.</p> <p>Workers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. \u201cIt only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">How much is an hour worth?

  "<p>\u201cMake America great again\u201d was an election winning slogan with a bold and simple message. \u201cOpening up America again\u201d proved to be less clear cut and left questions in the air.</p> <p>On Thursday Donald Trump unveiled federal staggered guidelines for getting America back to business after the shutdown forced by the coronavirus pandemic. He had previously billed it as the most important decision of his presidency, but what he called \u201ca science-based reopening\u201d was messier and more ill-defined.</p> <p>First, the good news. The 18-page document explicitly used the word \u201cguidelines\u201d \u2013 a far cry from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">\u201ctotal authority\u201d</a> he claimed earlier this week. It delegates authority to state governors and city mayors to weigh the risk-to-reward ratio of opening businesses, churches and schools, which is the way it should be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/michigan-protest-coronavirus-rightwing-support\">Protests against US stay-at-home orders gain support from rightwing figures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also recognises the need to move gradually with baby steps, and the fact that America is vast \u2013 roughly the same size as Europe \u2013 with different needs in different places. \u201cWe are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time, and some states, they will be able to open up sooner than others,\u201d the president said.</p> <p>Even Trump, who has turned his briefings into mini-campaign rallies, seemed relatively disciplined and focused at the White House on Thursday. He was broadly in step with his experts, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci. For all his wild words in recent weeks, including calling for the country to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\">reopen at Easter</a>, Trump has at least heeded the professionals when it came to extending physical distancing guidelines and now seeking to wind them down.</p> <p>The document proposes that, before reopening, states should see a decrease in confirmed Covid-19 cases over a 14-day period, have a \u201crobust testing system in place for at-risk healthcare workers\u201d, and hospitals should be able to \u201ctreat all patients without crisis care\u201d.</p> <p>But there are plenty of ambiguities. The guidelines do not give a firm target date. Trump said some states could reopen \u201ctomorrow\u201d but declined to name them. The guidelines emphasise the need for testing but do not make clear how many tests will be enough, nor set out a national testing strategy. Yet testing and contact tracing have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">key to the relative success of countries</a> such as Germany and South Korea.</p> <p>House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the guidelines lack of clarity on a national testing strategy, saying in statement: \u201cTesting is the key to opening our country to resume our lives. The White House\u2019s vague and inconsistent document does nothing to make up for the president\u2019s failure to listen to the scientists and produce and distribute national rapid testing.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of that secure knowledge, the public may not respond to Trump\u2019s summons. More than four in five people say Americans should \u201ccontinue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy\u201d, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday.</p> <p>And even on one of his more restrained days, Trump made some worrying statements. He kept referring to the virus in the past tense, even as thousands of people continue to die every day. \u201cNow that we are past the peak in new cases, we are starting life again,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/santa-monica-nurses-suspended-n95-masks-coronavirus\">Ten nurses suspended for refusing to work without N95 masks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf the virus returns in the fall as some scientists think it may, possibly, these guidelines will ensure the country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, tweeted: \u201cThat briefing had everything but the \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 banner. Now let\u2019s start ignoring the president and concentrate on where the power is: the states and cities.\u201d</p> <p>In the week that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">halted funding to the World Health Organization</a>, Trump made reference to \u201ca cruel virus from a distant land\u201d and said border control and travel restrictions are more important than ever. He reflected: \u201cIn 1917, they went through something that was similar\u201d, \u2013 he was off by a year, as the Spanish flu was in 1918.</p> <p>And he told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a new normal. Normal is going to be if a restaurant had 158 seats filled before, they are going to have 158 seats filled again.\u201d Experts have warned such a prospect is still a very long way off.</p> <p>The political benefit of asking individual states to call the shots is that, if things go wrong, Trump will claim he is shielded from blame. He said: \u201cWe have some states that got too much credit for what they\u2019ve done, frankly. I could name you a couple of those.\u201d</p> <p>Trump described himself as a healer and claimed that partisan politics should be put aside. \u201cI don\u2019t care about campaigning,\u201d he said. But it will not be long, perhaps, before he is back on the trail.</p>",

I conclude that the applicant was not afforded procedural fairness in the conduct of the August 2019 assessment and that a declaration should be made to this effect.\u201d</p> <p>The decision means that the injunction keeping the family in Australia will remain in effect until final orders are made. Moshinsky asked the government and the family\u2019s lawyers to either provide an agreed set of orders in seven days, or in 14 days to provide submissions from each side on proposed orders.</p> <p>The judgment was handed down to the family over a teleconference call. The coronavirus pandemic has forces the federal court to move to remote judgments.
