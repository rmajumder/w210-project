Closed airports, bonded labour, or other forms of unbreakable employment contracts, and little access to funds, have made it close to impossible for those who want to leave to do so.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>Lebanon</strong>, where an economic meltdown had already shattered household incomes before the coronavirus lockdown, both Amnesty International and the International Labour Organisation fear that many domestic workers are no longer being paid. There are concerns that with families confined to homes, workers have been forced into more intensive and dangerous work, facing obsessive demands to clean inside the house, and dangerous xenophobia on rare trips outside. </p> \n  <p>Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As one of the most marginalised groups in Lebanon, the government needs to clearly warn that it will prosecute employers who exploit or abuse migrant domestic workers. It should also ensure they are granted access to health care during the pandemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Lebanon, the 250,000 strong migrant workforce consists primarily of domestic workers who usually live in the homes of their employers.</p> \n  <p>In the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), where foreign workers make up 90% of the population of the <strong>UAE</strong>, 60% in <strong>Kuwait</strong>, 50% in <strong>Bahrain</strong>, and 33% in <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, large numbers of migrant workers are instead housed in labor camps. Many have been stood down since the corona outbreak, and can neither depart for their home countries or leave their compounds. Social distancing is very difficult and access to advanced health care is often limited.</p> \n  <p>While official coronavirus numbers in the Gulf states are relatively low, compared with the region\u2019s most seriously affected state, Iran, there are concerns that migrant camps are dangerous incubators for the virus, and are not adequately checked by authorities who give precedence to citizens and expatriate residents.</p> \n  <p>When the region\u2019s airports eventually open, potentially by the end of Ramadan in late May, some GCC countries are expecting many laid off skilled and unskilled workers \u2013 who can still afford to leave \u2013 to attempt to do so. In the meantime, several million others face what NGOs believe to be a heightened risk and increasing uncertainty</p> \n  <p>The coronavirus crisis has crippled employment across the Gulf and could spell ruin for construction, retail and other sectors. The upshot could threaten the very future of migrant labour in all countries \u2013 and in turn threaten the viability of some of the world\u2019s richest economies.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:31:17.639Z\">at 12.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e96ea678f082a2cd32a7171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:07:42.335Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>EU</strong>\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has slammed the US decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF/status/1250356625803599875\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WHO</a>.

WHAT A GOAL!!! Holland 2-1 Argentina (Bergkamp, 90 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Diego Maradona against England in 1986 multiplied by Marco Van Basten against USSR in 1988 divided by Michael Owen against Argentina this week = this goal, one of the greatest that will ever be scored in any football match at any time in any place. It all started with an Argentina attack, Lopez\u2019s cross from the left drifting over the unmarked Batistuta in the middle. With no other Argentina players about, Frank De Boer was able to stroll out of defence, bringing the ball up towards the halfway line. Assessing his options, he looked to release the ball, before spotting Bergkamp making a run in the corner of his eye. With that wand of a left foot, he hit a magnificent 70-yard diagonal pass to Bergkamp, who had advanced into the right side of Argentina\u2018s area. He let the ball drop over his shoulder and what followed were three touches of genius, each with his right foot. The first saw him pluck the ball out of the sky with astonishing elan. With Ayala marking him tightly, he poked the ball inside to wrongfoot the defender, who goes screeching off into the distance like Road Runner, and then, with his third, with greatness beckoning, he toepoked the ball as it bounced up into the top left corner of Roa\u2019s goal from the right corner of the six-yard box. The stadium erupts, Argentina collapse and Bergkamp races away to be mobbed by jubilant, disbelieving team-mates.. He did it so many times for Arsenal last season, but this is the winner <em>in the last minute of a World Cup quarter-final against Argentina</em>. Barring a minor miracle, Holland are through. It\u2019s Rob Rensenbrink in reverse!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a96a430a83c4bf550d25fbcc4453811715be6a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a96a430a83c4bf550d25fbcc4453811715be6a7/0_0_1864_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland\u2019s Dennis Bergkamp controls the ball before firing in the winning goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Bergkamp controls the ball ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"467dfab6aec6610b752ccf896222886a4e659388\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/467dfab6aec6610b752ccf896222886a4e659388/0_359_5904_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Bergkamp fire the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa for the Netherland\u2019s last minute winner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Bergkamp fire the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa for the Netherland\u2019s last minute winner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VI-Images via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d503badbcde6390417e0a292e7d643a301f3f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d503badbcde6390417e0a292e7d643a301f3f6/0_0_2000_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland\u2019s Dennis Bergkamp, left, is congratulated by teammates Wim Jonk, right, and Marc Overmars after scoring the winning goal against Argentina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bergkamp, left, is congratulated by teammates Wim Jonk, right, and Marc Overmars after scoring his stupendous goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Mazal\u00e1n/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:33:31.948Z\">at 9.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e976de18f08ea7431f43924\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:26:56.857Z\">9.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">OH MY WORD!

For such a brainy player, it\u2019s as if someone just flicked off the switch in his head. In the great pantheon of moronic red cards, this one\u2019s right up there. It was just so pointless. With Argentina pressing, Ortega had the ball on the right of Holland\u2019s area. Faced by Stam, he cut inside, before swiftly jinking outside. Stam hung out his left leg, which was the cue for Ortega to take a preposterous tumble. The referee blew - momentarily it seemed for a penalty - but he then flashed a yellow card in Ortega\u2019s direction. Van der Sar then ran over to remonstrate with the Argentinian for diving. Ortega was still on the floor but having been provoked, he bounced up, intentionally crashing the top of his head against Van der Sar\u2019s chin in the process. Right in front of the referee, who immediately shows him red. Ortega has lost Argentina their numerical advantage.

Numan might blame Davids for the referee\u2019s decision though, because just before he made his tackle, the midfielder had clattered into Veron on the halfway line. Advantage was played, but once Simeone got to the loose ball, Numan chopped him down, his victim flying through the air and writhing in agony. He\u2019s probably not hurt but it was a cynical foul, despite Holland\u2019s protestations. Sensini is enthusiastically applauding the decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98815aa7432fbc56f9bb4a6b605387f4d028cdf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98815aa7432fbc56f9bb4a6b605387f4d028cdf5/0_0_1784_1441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netherlands are down to 10 men as Arthur Numan is given his marching orders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"808\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netherlands are down to 10 men as Arthur Numan is given his marching orders, much to the amusement of Roberto Sensini (second left).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Franklin/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:19:02.861Z\">at 9.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e976a798f0895d83068ece4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:12:45.464Z\">9.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>74 min: </strong>Numan crosses towards the penalty area but Bergkamp had to backtrack to reach it and he was off balance as he nodded tamely wide left.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e976a228f08ea7431f43919\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:11:28.505Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>72 min:</strong> There goes Numan again.

Argentina take advantages of the gaps in Holland\u2019s defence again on the counter. The danger looks to have been averted by Holland, until Veron nips the ball away from Overmars just outside his own area. The ball diverts to Batistuta but just as he\u2019s about to pull the trigger, play is brought back for a foul on Overmars.

A long, raking pass from Stam located him deep on the right. He made a complete fool of Simeone, leaving him befuddled and red-faced on the turf with a sumptuous turn, before digging out a delightful cross, which Kluivert headed goalwards, Roa acrobatically leaping backwards to turn his effort over the bar. Like Batistuta before him, Kluivert can\u2019t believe it.

And what do you know, no sooner do they show some ambition, they hit the post for the second time in the match! Veron leads the counter, running some distance with the ball unchallenged, before finding Batistuta, who\u2019s peeled off to the right. With Holland\u2019s defence completely exposed, a superb first touch with his right foot takes him into the area and past Frank De Boer. His second isn\u2019t too shabby either, an absolute piledriver with his left foot that screams on to the inside of the left post. That was all the more remarkable because Batistuta has been completely invisible, but he only needs one moment to change the game (although he needs another one now). Holland respond with their first substitution, Overmars on for Ronald De Boer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2878c0672e741455750a4d9caa9429e344bb727c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2878c0672e741455750a4d9caa9429e344bb727c/0_112_3674_2205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Argentina\u2019s Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina surges forward,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Argentina\u2019s Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina surges forward,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:47:56.334Z\">at 9.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9768078f08ea7431f4390e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:02:06.525Z\">9.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>63 min: </strong>The ball has been in Argentina\u2019s half for roughly ten minutes now.

Holland 1-1 Argentina (Lopez, 17 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The reprieve was only temporary. Just seconds after that Veron chance, Argentina draw level with the slickest of goals. Remarkably it came straight from Holland\u2019s clearance and this has been the game in microcosm, with the Dutch simply incapable of holding on to possession for more than a few seconds. Van der Sar hoofed the ball to Bergkamp on the halfway line but he was swiftly engulfed by three Argentina defenders. Veron was left unattended in space between the midfield and the back four, and had ample time to slide a simple through ball straight down the middle for Lopez, beating an awful offside trap with ease. What followed was one of the coolest goals you could hope to see, Lopez opening up his body to put the ball on to his left, before producing roughly 73 dummies and feints in a bid to dupe Van der Sar. Just as one was about to scream at him to shoot, Van der Sar, simply unable to wait any longer, took the bait and collapsed on his backside, and Lopez, looking like a man supping a cocktail on the beach, rolled the ball through his legs and into the net. That was so infuriatingly calm - he could have done anything he wanted once Van der Sar had fallen - and it could only have been more insulting if he\u2019d walked the ball to the line, stooped down to his knees and nodded it in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"856b5ea148f168957c1a3b57be217f837d3a2a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/856b5ea148f168957c1a3b57be217f837d3a2a6e/0_0_1988_1462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Lopez, left,slots the ball past Netherland\u2019s goalie Edwin Van Der Sar to get Argentina back on level terms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudio Lopez, left,slots the ball past Netherland\u2019s goalie Edwin Van Der Sar to get Argentina back on level terms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08b8135c56f5462538ebbb868fce1637829d0269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b8135c56f5462538ebbb868fce1637829d0269/0_0_2416_1448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Lopez celebrates his goal with Gabriel Batistuta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lopez celebrates his goal with Gabriel Batistuta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T19:20:30.245Z\">at 8.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9759a08f08cf571cdb1b5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T19:02:14.502Z\">8.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>17 min:</strong> Whoops!

Suddenly realising that Ortega has a free run at his defence, Numan cynically brings him down, conceding a free-kick and injuring himself in the process. As he lies prone on the turf, a yellow card is flashed in his direction. How heartless. He\u2019s hurt himself, in case you didn\u2019t see! From the resulting free-kick, Argentina nearly find the equaliser. It was taken short and the sublime Veron loped ominously into Dutch territory. Upon reaching the area, he played a lovely wall pass with Batistuta, Holland carved open like a biology student dissecting a frog, but was just unable to reach the return on the stretch and Van der Sar plunges on the ball.

They\u2019ve been well below par in midfield, but Ronald De Boer has taken the game by the scruff of the neck here, dodging Almeyda\u2019s challenge and gliding supremely through a centre as soft as mushy peas. Twenty-five yards from goal, it looked for a moment as if he would shoot, but instead he disguised his intentions and chipped a delightful pass towards Bergkamp, who had edged to the left. Showing typically wonderful awareness, Bergkamp sliced open Argentina\u2019s dizzy defence, coaxing the ball into the path of Kluivert with a gorgeously cushioned header, allowing the striker to stroll through the middle and coolly clip the ball over the onrushing Roa from 15 yards out. That was a sublime team goal. And yet so crushingly simple.

Assuming you haven\u2019t been living under a rock for the last week or so, you\u2019ll have heard about the slightly controversial match that took place in St Etienne four days ago. So, no prizes for guessing who England fans will be supporting here. Plus they\u2019re suckers for hard-luck stories. Backing the Dutch will feel normal. </p> <p> <strong>Which way will it go, though?</strong> All hype aside, Argentina are fortunate to be in this quarter-final at England\u2019s expense. After all Glenn Hoddle\u2019s side were magnificent on Tuesday night. Only, nothing went their way, Paul Scholes missing a glorious chance to make it 3-1 and lights out in the first half, David Beckham having a wee meltdown, Diego Simeone being Diego Simeone, Alan Shearer foolishly elbowing Carlos Roa as Sol Campbell \u2018scored\u2019, a curiously-placed divot denying Michael Owen when he went on another of those engrossing runs of his, a blatant handball in the area by Jose Chamot going unpunished during extra-time, David Seaman somehow letting in Roberto Ayala\u2019s atrocious penalty in the shoot-out and Kevin Keegan predicting that David Batty would score his. Oh Kevin! You make your own luck and all that, but still. If that match proved anything, it is that Argentina, for all their exquisite talent, are very much there for the taking.</p> <p><strong>Then again, Argentina might say the same about Holland. </strong>And with good reason too. The Dutch drew two of their group games, only managing a win against South Korea, and were then downright shabby against Yugoslavia in their second-round match. With the match poised at 1-1 in the second half, they were let off the hook when Predrag Mijatovic plonked a penalty against the bar, before Edgar Davids won it for Holland with a hit-and-hope effort from the edge of the area in the last minute. Again, there\u2019s terrific flair in that side, but it\u2019s yet to really catch fire. But what do I know? Both sides are still unbeaten. It\u2019s bound to be tight.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T17:49:49.661Z\">at 6.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9650638f08213494be6c88\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T10:37:46.987Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>The mere mention of R</strong><strong>ob </strong><strong>R</strong><strong>ensenbrink</strong><strong> should be enough to send a shiver down the spine of any Holland fan old enough to remember the 1978 World Cup.</strong> Rensenbrink, of course, is the byword for footballing misfortune, the man who stared glory in the face and blinked. He was the man who could have altered history, who could have defined a generation. Instead he was the man who missed \u2013 in the last minute of the World Cup final. </p> <p> With the match against the hosts Argentina delicately poised at 1-1, Holland had a free-kick just inside their half. From the centre circle, it was sent long into the Argentina area by Ruud Krol. The defending was poor, Argentina\u2019s right-back allowing the pass to bounce through to Rensenbrink, whose run had gone unnoticed by his supposed marker. The attacker reached the ball before the goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol, stuck out his left leg and poked a shot goalwards from the left side of the six-yard box. <br>  As he made contact with the ball, Fillol clattered into him, which would hardly have made a difference to Rensenbrink if his effort had rolled into the empty goal. How could it have? With the last kick of the match, he would have won the World Cup for Holland, for the first time, four years after they had lost in the final to West Germany. But the ball took one final bounce on its journey and that was all it required to alter the shot\u2019s trajectory, kick fatefully away from goal, on to the near post and back out into the area. It was hacked clear, and moments later the full-time whistle blew. </p> <p>Needless to say, Argentina scored twice in extra-time to secure a 3-1 victory. They, not Holland, had their name on the trophy for the first time. Eight years later, they won it for the second time. Twenty years later, Holland have not gone closer. Today they have a chance for revenge, an opportunity to reach the last four at Argentina\u2019s expense.

At his press conference Hancock wrongly said that he had not set a target of 25,000 tests a day. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9739718f08ea7431f436e0#block-5e9739718f08ea7431f436e0\"> 5.45pm.)</a> But he did recommit himself to the 100,000 tests a day target by the end of the month - despite widespread doubts as to whether this is achievable. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And as we build capacity further over this month and then beyond to that 100,000 a day target by the end of this month we\u2019ll expand further those who are eligible for tests - all as part of the plan to get a hold of this virus and make sure that we support the key public services that we need as this moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He published <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879639/covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan.pdf\">a coronavirus action plan for adult social care (pdf)</a>. </strong>The plans involve increased testing and improved access to protective equipment for people in care homes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said that the daily death toll from coronavirus in the UK was reaching its peak.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On the issue of the peak, our view is that it is probably reaching the peak overall. That is what the flattening shows. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Whitty also said the number of deaths might go up tomorrow. That was because, after every weekend, there was a dip in reported deaths at the weekend, and for two days afterwards, followed by a rise. And he said deaths would continue at a high rate for a while. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the moment we are not yet at the point where we can say confidently and safely this is now past the peak and we can start thinking very much about the next phases. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty also said that the experts did not know yet what the reproduction number for coronavirus was (the rate at which it is transmitted). It was between 0.5 and 1, he said. (One is the point where one new person gets infected for every person with the virus etc. The reproduction number has to be below 1 for the epidemic to be on the decline.) He said the better the understanding of this number, the more easy it would be for the experts to anticipate what would happen next.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said that he wanted to change hospital rules so that \u201cwherever possible\u201d people will be given the \u201cchance to say goodbye\u201d to loved ones dying with coronavirus.</strong> He said that \u201cwanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts\u201d, and that he wept at reports of 13-year-old Ismail dying without a parent at his bedside. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m pleased to say that working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we are introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection while wherever possible giving people\u2019s closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he was promoting a badge for carers, so that they would be able to receive the same public respect as NHS staff.</strong> Displaying the badge, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identify themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo.

Forsyth writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The thinking is that a delay would not solve the fundamental policy problems and that a deal is either possible or not. Another factor, I understand, is that the government worries about the cost of any extension. There is concern that extending could drag the UK into the arguments about who pays for the various EU schemes designed to protect the European economy and preserve the eurozone. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Government sources are saying this afternoon that, when <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser, spoke to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier today about the next round of the Brexit talks, he stressed that the UK does not intend to ask for an extension.</p> \n  <p>However, Forsyth also floats the possibility that the EU could request an extension, not the UK. \u201cIf the EU did ask for more time, it would put the government in a difficult position,\u201d Forsyth writes. \u201cRejecting the request would sit ill with the idea that the UK wants to be a good neighbour to the EU.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under the withdrawal agreement the transition can be extended for one year or two years if both sides agree before 1 July. However the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act says UK ministers are not allowed to agree to an extension. For the government to allow an extension, it would have to pass legislation amending the act.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344/473_20_2298_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Frost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Frost.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e971f448f0895d83068e8f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T15:13:42.826Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Turning away from coronavirus for a moment, <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary, has used <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/04/unite-behind-keir-starmer-to-cleanse-labours-shame/\">an article for LabourList</a> to urge Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, to publish a redacted version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/labour-leader-sir-kier-starmer-orders-urgent-review-leaked-antisemitism-report\">the internal party report leaked at the weekend</a> that showed how hostile some party officials were to Jeremy Corbyn.

Writing in a letter to the foreign secretary, <strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, who is deputising for the prime minister while he recovers from the virus, Starmer said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The question for Thursday therefore is no longer about whether the lockdown should be extended, but about what the government\u2019s position is on how and when it can be eased in due course and on what criteria that decision will be taken.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Responding to the Labour leader\u2019s demand, a government source said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Talk of an exit strategy before we have reached the peak risks confusing the critical message that people need to stay at home in order to protect our NHS and save lives.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The question of how to bring the UK out of lockdown safely has been given more urgency (if that were possible) by a warning by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/rishi-sunak-deeply-troubled-by-obr-warning-of-35-fall-in-uk-gdp\">the Office for Budget Responsibility</a> (OBR) yesterday that the UK economy could shrink by 35% in the coming months.

  "<p>Conservative politicians vying for the leadership of Angela Merkel\u2019s party argued over a timetable to exit the nationwide lockdown as the German chancellor announced plans to partially reopen schools and shops in the coming weeks.</p> \n<p>Hailing latest figures indicating a slowing down of the infection rate as a \u201cfragile intermediate success\u201d, Merkel said on Wednesday evening that teaching at schools across the country would start again from 4 May, initially for students in their final years of primary or secondary school.</p> \n<p>Hairdressing salons will also be allowed to reopen on 4 May if they take special steps to guarantee customers\u2019 hygiene. Shops of up to 800 square metres in size, as well as bookshops, bike stores and car dealerships, will open again from this coming Monday.</p> \n<p>Social distancing measures will remain in place until 3 May and large cultural events, such as concerts and beer festivals, will remain banned until the end of August.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Merkel \u201curgently recommended\u201d people to wear protective masks on public transport and while shopping, but stopped short of making them mandatory. \u201cWe have achieved something that wasn\u2019t guaranteed,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cOur health system has kept running\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, under Germany\u2019s federalised system the closure and reopening of schools and nurseries falls under the jurisdiction of the states or <em>L\u00e4nder</em>, meaning any concerted exit strategy envisioned by Merkel requires a consensus among the 16 state premiers, which has been hard to achieve.</p> \n<p>Merkel stepped out in front of the cameras to make her announcement an hour and a half late following a video conference that reportedly involved clashes between the most powerful state premiers. Disagreements over the timetable for an exit route out of the lockdown have cut across German party line in unexpected ways.</p> \n<p>Until the crisis rewired the dynamics of German politics, Armin Laschet, the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, was seen as the frontrunner in a trio of male politicians vying to take over the leadership of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, and the closest option there was to a continuity candidate.</p> \n<p>But in the heated discussion over the timetable for relaxing the current restrictions on social movement, Laschet has at times found himself at odds with the chancellor whose decisions he loyally defended at the peak of the 2015 refugee crisis.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday this week German media reported that North-Rhine Westphalia was intending to start reopening schools as soon as next week, after the end of the Easter holidays \u2013 a unilateral move that put him at odds with the head of government. \u201cArmin Laschet, the barger\u201d, ran a headline in the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.</p> \n<p>Merkel appeared to hint at her opposition to Laschet\u2019s stance on Wednesday when she warned against \u201crushing ahead\u201d to end the lockdown.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/virologists-to-turn-germany-worst-hit-district-into-coronavirus-laboratory\">Worst-hit German district to become coronavirus \u2018laboratory\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Laschet has also been accused of trying to rush researchers into providing the scientific data to support his call for a speedy path out of the lockdown.

The leader of the Christian Social Union, sister party to the CDU, is not officially in the running to fill the soon to be vacant seat at the top of Germany\u2019s biggest political party, but his leadership has given him a reach that is historically unusual for politicians from Germany\u2019s southernmost state, whose strong cultural identity and Catholic roots can make its public figures less relatable further north.</p> \n<p>As others dithered over lockdown measures, S\u00f6der took decisive steps to close down schools, bars and restaurants that the rest of the country eventually followed.

  "<p>\u201cPsychologically, it\u2019s been terrible,\u201d says Dr Dawn Liu, of the coronavirus wedding ban. \u201cThere\u2019s been this absolute sense of insecurity, this threat that in the middle of a pandemic I might be told to leave my fiance and take a flight, which is really risky.

Both are academics at the University of Essex: they met on OkCupid in June 2018, before getting engaged the following year. Liu is originally from Singapore, and is on a tier 2 working visa, which grants her the right to live and work in the UK. Under normal circumstances, Liu would have had plenty of time after her April wedding to apply for a spouse visa before her tier 2 visa expired on 14 July, enabling her to continue working and living in the UK.</p> \n<p>But after the government banned weddings on 23 March, to prevent the coronavirus pandemic spreading, Liu and Holford have found themselves in immigration limbo.

However, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa/partner-spouse\">engaged people</a> are not allowed to work on spouse visas \u2013 meaning that Liu would have to quit her job if she wanted to remain in the UK with Holford. And although the government has automatically extended all visas that were set to expire during the lockdown to 31 May, this won\u2019t help Liu, as her visa expires after then. \u201cIt\u2019s a circular legal nightmare for us,\u201d says Holford. </p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cUnder the immigration rules, anyone on a work visa who was granted leave for more than six months can apply to switch to a spouse visa. This applies to married and unmarried couples and was the case before the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d They did not comment on whether visas would be extended beyond the 31 May cut-off date, to help people such as Liu.</p> \n<p>Unlike funerals, which are still ongoing during the coronavirus lockdown, albeit with only immediate family in attendance, all wedding ceremonies and registrations have been put on hold.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we register the wedding in a room with just the registrar, the couple, and two witnesses, all spread out in a room according to social distancing guidelines?\u201d says Holford.</p> \n<p>The coronavirus wedding lockdown is also proving unexpectedly costly for the couples reliant on marriage to certify their immigration status. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rack up,\u201d says Mariah Abshire, who is 23 and lives in Arnos Grove.</p> \n<p>Abshire, a US citizen, was meant to marry her fiance, Nikolay Bogdev, 24, on 23 March \u2013 the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. The day before her wedding, Abshire got a phone call from her registry office. \u201cIt was insane!\u201d she says. \u201cWe got the call literally the day before saying they were locking it down.\u201d She has asked her council when she may be able to reschedule her wedding, but they weren\u2019t able to give her any concrete answers.</p> \n<p>Abshire\u2019s fiance visa is set to expire on 9 July. She will most likely have to apply to extend it, at the cost of \u00a31,033. \u201cIt would be great if they did waive those extension charges, given that this is unprecedented,\u201d says Abshire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a personal issue that came up needing us to get an extension. It\u2019s a national emergency that is causing everything to go on pause. It would be helpful if the government could bear that in mind, seeing as how people aren\u2019t allowed to work here legally and need to fork out a lot of money to stay here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Holford and Liu would like further clarity from the government on whether they will automatically extend visas beyond the 31 May date, particularly now that it looks likely the coronavirus lockdown will go on for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has been vague in their promises,\u201d says immigration specialist Robin Molyneux of Global Immigration Solutions. \u201cThey should look at having a provision for anyone whose visa was expiring by a later date being automatically extended, without fees being payable for people having to renew them.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Liu and Holford are waiting anxiously. \u201cWhen we tell people that we had to postpone our wedding, they say: \u2018Oh it must be hard to have to postpone!\u2019 But they are missing the point. Marriage isn\u2019t just a piece of paper. So much depends on it. Weddings are important for legal reasons.\u201d</p>",

The resulting nationwide resource\u2014the first of its kind\u2014 will allow journalists at the Guardian and KHN to identify patterns in how the pandemic impacts healthcare workers, shedding light on the workings and failings of the US healthcare system. Dozens of healthcare workers have already died in the pandemic and thousands have been infected, and the numbers are expected to climb significantly.</p> <p>The series launched with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/09/first-doctor-die-coronavirus-us-frank-gabrin-er\"> a profile of Frank Gabrin</a>, America\u2019s first ER doctor to die on the frontline of the coronavirus battle, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/nurses-surgeons-janitors-first-us-health-workers-to-die-covid-19\">profiles of</a> a jail nurse in New Jersey, a surgeon in New York City, a Veteran Affairs nurse in Detroit, and nurses at hospitals in California and Nevada.</p> <p>Information about healthcare workers will be crowdsourced from family, friends and colleagues of healthcare workers, as well as reported through traditional means. The series will feature profiles, photos and other information about those who have lost their lives since the outbreak began.</p> <p><br>The Guardian and KHN are inviting news organizations across the country to partner in the effort. The project will link to local news stories on healthcare worker deaths, and most content from the series will be freely available to other news organizations to republish. The project will reflect the rich diversity of the U.S. healthcare workforce.

  "<p>There was a dramatic melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet in the summer of 2019, researchers have confirmed, in a study that reveals the loss was largely down to a persistent zone of high pressure over the region.</p> <p>The ice sheet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/heatwaves-amplify-near-record-levels-of-ice-melt-in-northern-hemisphere\">melted at a near record rate in 2019</a>, and much faster than the average of previous decades. Figures have suggested that in July alone surface ice declined by 197 gigatonnes \u2013 equivalent to about 80 million Olympic swimming pools.</p> <p>Now experts have examined the level of melting in more detail, revealing what drove it. Crucially, the team note, the high pressure conditions lasted for 63 of the 92 summer days in 2019, compared with an average of just 28 days between 1981 and 2010. A similar situation was seen in 2012, a record bad year for melting of the ice sheet.</p> <p>The team say the climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not taken into account such unusual conditions. If such high pressure zones become a regular annual feature, future melting could be twice as high as currently predicted, a result that could have serious consequences for sea level rise.</p> <p>\u201cThis melt event is a good alarm signal that we urgently need to change our way of living to hold [back] global warming because it is likely that the IPCC projections could be too optimistic for [the] Arctic,\u201d said Dr Xavier Fettweis, co-author of the research from the University of Liege, adding that the atmospheric conditions were unlikely to be down to natural climatic variability and could be driven by global heating.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.the-cryosphere.net/14/1209/2020/\">Writing in the journal </a><a href=\"https://www.the-cryosphere.net/14/1209/2020/\">the Cryosphere</a>, Fettweis and his co-author Marco Tedesco from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University report how they used satellite data, climate models and global weather patterns to explore the melting of the surface of the ice sheet last year.</p> <p>Among their findings the team report that almost 96% of the ice sheet underwent melting at some time in 2019, compared with an average of just over 64% between 1981 and 2010.</p> <p>Using models, the pair also found that about 560Gt of meltwater runoff was generated in the summer of 2019. The surface mass balance, the amount of ice the sheet gained from rain and snowfall minus the amount lost through meltwater run off and evaporation, was just 54Gt a year\u2013 about 320Gt a year lower than the average across the earlier decades, and the greatest such drop on record.</p> <p>Further analysis showed the level and distribution of melting to be closely tied to a number of factors, including levels of snowfall and reflection of sunlight \u2013 known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/03/on-reflection-albedo-effect-word-of-the-week\">albedo</a> \u2013 as well as cloudiness and absorption of sunlight. All of these, they note, were influenced by the persistent high pressure zone over the ice sheet last summer.</p> <p>Dr Poul Christoffersen, a glaciologist at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research, noting only 2012 had a higher meltwater runoff in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, this shows that extreme melt events are becoming a lot more frequent,\u201d he said, adding that the new study showed that persistent atmospheric high pressure was an important factor, resulting in clear skies and a lack of snowfall in the south and warm, moist air being brought to northern parts of the ice sheet. \u201cIn that sense, the extreme melt years can be seen as natural events exacerbated by climate change,\u201d said Christoffersen.</p> <p>Prof Andy Shepherd from the University of Leeds said a fall in surface mass balance was concerning. \u201cIf that drops below zero, then the ice sheet is no longer viable because in every year it is losing more ice than it gains,\u201d he said, adding that that was not even counting the loss of icebergs. \u201cEven if the glaciers stopped flowing, which is not going to happen, it would mean that the ice sheet still can\u2019t survive,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Asylum seekers are being made to share cramped rooms and even beds with strangers in breach of strict measures to contain coronavirus, charities have warned.</p> \n<p>Overcrowding in government accommodation has led to new people being brought into shared rooms in hostels since the UK-wide lockdown began last month, according to <a href=\"https://www.refugee-action.org.uk/\">Refugee Action</a>, <a href=\"https://asylummatters.org/\">Asylum Matters</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/\">Scottish Refugee Council</a>.</p> \n<p>The charities said that although the Home Office had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/home-office-to-hold-on-evicting-asylum-seekers-from-state-accommodation\">stopped evictions from its asylum accommodation</a> for three months because of Covid-19, there was insufficient capacity to safely house the growth in the asylum seeker population.</p> \n<p>They added that the crisis would increase because up to 50,000 more people need to be accommodated due to the decision to allow people whose asylum claim or appeal has been rejected, as well as those granted refugee status, to stay put.</p> \n<p>Their concern comes after it emerged that the high court ordered the home secretary, Priti Patel, to rehouse a man who developed Covid-19 symptoms after another symptomatic asylum seeker was put in his room.

  "<p>Most easy recipes are not easy. Achieving simplicity is never actually that simple, but in the kitchen it is usually also contingent on a well-trained hand and a very well-stocked pantry. This makes the genuinely easy three-ingredient recipe a holy grail of sorts.</p> <p>Here, then, the mother lode: 50 three-ingredient beauties. Some are meals in themselves. Some are a good base to build upon. Others still are a sweet something for afters. They run the gamut from \u201cblink and it\u2019s ready\u201d to a long, slow cook, but none will break the bank. Crucially, all use only three things other than oil, butter, salt, pepper and water.

Beat 5-10 room-temperature eggs (depending on pan size) with whichever grated cheese you have (parmesan, pecorino, feta \u2026), then stir the hot veg into the eggs, and reheat the pan over a medium-high flame.</p> <p>Run a dash of oil round the edge of the pan and add the mixture, lower the heat and cook for eight minutes or so, until half set. Turn out on to a plate (this takes confidence and grace), reheat the pan to medium-high, slide the frittata back in and tuck in the edges with a spoon. Reduce the heat to low and cook for a further eight minutes, until just firm, or you have a hunch it might have just a little seductive ooze in the centre.

Add the oil, two onions, peeled and finely chopped, and \u00bd teaspoon of salt. Cook for five minutes or so, until soft. Add the cooked split peas and 350ml of cold water. Bring to a simmer for a few minutes, then remove from the heat. Ladle half the soup into a bowl and set aside. Use a stick blender to puree the rest of the soup in the pan. Stir the chunky soup back into the puree for a soup that is nicely textured. Thin the soup with more water (or stock) as needed before serving, seasoned with some flaky salt and a good squeeze of lemon.</p> <h2><strong>Lentil bologn</strong><strong>ese</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jessica Stanley, @dailydoseofjess<br></strong>Use one tin of whole tomatoes per person for this. Start by draining the juice fromthe tomatoes and reserve for a future recipe. Rinse the whole tomatoes, taking care to keep their shape. Pat dry, cover in olive oil, sprinkle with salt. Cook for two hours at 140C/120C fan/275F/gas mark 1, or for an hour and a half at 160C/. Crush the tomatoes with a fork or potato masher. Add a tin per person of (drained and rinsed) lentils, heat through and serve with spaghetti.</p> <h2><strong>Fermented rye soup with garlic (\u017burek)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Zuza Zak, cookbook author, @zuzazakcooks<br></strong>Put four tablespoons of rye flour in a large jar with two crushed cloves of garlic, and cover with 400ml of warm (pre-boiled) water. Cover with a tea towel and allow to stand in your kitchen for five days, stirring daily. After that, keep it in your fridge. To make the soup, add to a litre of vegetable stock and heat through. Top with crispy bits of garlic or garlic croutons to serve. Optional extra toppings include a lick of cream and can be served with a hard-boiled egg, fried bacon bits or whatever you have available.</p> <h2><strong>Smoked mackerel with beetroot and horseradish</strong></h2> <p><strong>Anna Thomson, @kandojournalandkitchen<br></strong>Peel and slice the beetroot into chunky slices. Drizzle with olive oil and season, bake in the oven until soft and slightly caramelised. Fry mackerel fillets on both sides until the skin is crisp (ensure your kitchen is well ventilated!) Serve on the roasted beetroot with a generous dollop of horseradish or tartare sauce (mayonnaise or plain yoghurt spiked with lemon and garlic works, too).</p> <h2><strong>Chicken stock egg pudding (chawanmushi)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ollie Templeton, Carousel, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carousel_ldn/?hl=en\">@carousel_ldn</a><br></strong>Whisk four eggs with 500ml of chicken stock and 1-2 tablespoons of soy sauce, then sieve and pour into four bowls. Cover with tin foil and steam in a steamer (or a large lidded pot with boiling water going halfway up the sides of the bowls) for 30 minutes, until set \u2013 there should be a nice wobble in the middle. Allow to cool before serving.</p> <h2>Halloumi and apricot jam sandwich</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a26c67630bfad90f970655edc15e4ceb5d6a09c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a26c67630bfad90f970655edc15e4ceb5d6a09c0/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georgina Hayden\u2019s halloumi and apricot jam sandwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgina Hayden\u2019s halloumi and apricot jam sandwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Georgina Hayden, cookbook author, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/georgiepuddingnpie/\">@georgiepuddingnpie</a><br></strong>Heat a griddle pan \u2013 or your oven grill \u2013 and grill three slices of halloumi (about 1\u00bdcm thick) for a couple of minutes on both sides, until golden and soft, but not rubbery. Meanwhile, lightly toast two slices of bread (good quality white is best), butter and top with a good layer of apricot jam. When the halloumi is ready, put it on the jam, close the sandwich and gently press together. Serve immediately, while the cheese is warm.</p> <h2><strong>Lemon posset</strong></h2> <p><strong>Alex Head, Social Pantry, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/social_pantry/?hl=en\">@social_pantry</a><br></strong>Slowly heat 400ml of cream and whisk in 100g caster sugar. Bring to a gentle simmer for three minutes then remove from the heat and whisk in the juice and grated zest of one large lemon. Divide between four ramekins and refrigerate until set and chilled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31a6f784e1ebbc69fed9dc3f24e0e7d9d3e739ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31a6f784e1ebbc69fed9dc3f24e0e7d9d3e739ac/0_264_4326_2597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close-Up Of Lemons Against White Backgroundlemon isolated on white background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Nut butter cookies</strong></h2> <p><strong>Simon Wood, MasterChef champion, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/simonjwooduk/?hl=en\">@simonjwooduk</a><br></strong>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4. In a large bowl or food processor, mix 240g of peanut butter, 100g of sugar and one egg into a dough. Take one tablespoonful at a time and roll it into a ball. Place each on a nonstick baking tray, flatten slightly with a fork and bake for 8-10 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies are golden. Remove from baking sheet and cool for 20 minutes before eating.</p> <h2><strong>Foolproof meringues</strong></h2> <p><strong>Natasha Collins, cookbook author, @neviepiecakes<br></strong>Heat the oven to 120C/100C fan/250 F/gas mark 1/2. Line two large baking trays with baking paper. Whisk together six egg whites and \u00be teaspoon of cream of tartar until stiff peaks form \u2013 this should only take a minute or so. Keep beating and gradually add 310g sugar, one tbsp at a time. Beat until the sugar has dissolved \u2013 if you rub a little of the mixture between your thumb and fingers it should feel smooth. Take a heaped tablespoon of the mixture and, with another spoon, drop on to the baking tray. Repeat with the rest of the mixture, then place the baking trays in the oven and bake for 2\u00bd hours. If you see the meringues starting to turn golden brown take them out. Leave to cool on the trays.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/six-best-quick-desserts-recipes-eton-mess-frozen-yoghurt-affogato-mousse\">Crunchie \u2018affogato\u2019</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"919c1ea8e0b1446a3965a2148902a62b9b125d53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/919c1ea8e0b1446a3965a2148902a62b9b125d53/359_275_2796_1678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Affogato\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>John Quilter, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/foodbusker/?hl=en\">@foodbusker</a><br></strong>Crush a Crunchie bar unopened in its wrapping with a rolling pin.

Peel, core and chop 5-6 pears into bite-size chunks. Pat dry and, in a mixing bowl, combine with 75g dark chocolate, roughly chopped. Unroll the pastry and, with the long edge facing you, pile the filling along the lower half of it. Moisten the edges with a little water and fold over the top. Press down on the edges with a fork to seal well. Make several cuts across the top.</p> <p>(Normally I\u2019d give the whole thing a final glaze with an milk/egg wash and sprinkle with a little demerara sugar for a crunchy finish, but it\u2019ll work just as well without). Bake for 30-35 minutes, until puffed up \u2013 cover with a piece of foil if it browns too quickly on the edges.</p> <h2>Berry \u2018ice-cream\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Claire Thom</strong><strong>son, cookbook author, <a href=\"http://5oclockapron.com/about\">fiveoclockapron</a><br></strong>Put 400g of frozen berries (or any frozen soft fruit, such as kiwi, mango, banana), two tablespoons of runny honey (or more to taste) and 200g of full-fat Greek yoghurt (or creme fraiche) in a blender and puree until smooth. Serve immediately.</p> <h2><strong>Almond nougat</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ciccio Sultano, Duomo, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cicciosultano1/?hl=en\">@cicciosultano1</a><br></strong>In a saucepan, melt 300g of granulated sugar and 100g of honey. In another pan, toast 100g of almonds. Once the almonds are golden, add to the sugar and caramelise for about 5-10 minutes. Remove from the heat and spread across an oiled chopping board, levelling the surface. With a long, sharp knife, cut into cubes, then leave to cool. Preserve in a glass jar.</p> <h2><strong>Roasted rhubarb with vanilla</strong></h2> <p><strong>Luisa Weiss, cookbook author, @wednesdaychef<br></strong>Heat the oven to 180C/160c fan/350F/gas mark 4. Cut 500g of rhubarb into 2-3-inch chunks and place in a baking dish. Slit one vanilla pod lengthways and scrape the seeds on to the rhubarb (or use one teaspoon of vanilla essence). Add 50g of sugar and toss gently to coat (push the bean under the rhubarb if using). Bake for 15-20 minutes, then set aside to cool (dry the bean, if used, and grind with more sugar for future use as vanilla sugar). Serve with cream or yoghurt, if you have any.</p> <h2><strong>Apple \u2018crumble\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jessica Stanley, @dailydoseofjess<br></strong>Grate an apple and sprinkle with granola. Serve with yoghurt</p> <h2>Quick crumble topping</h2> <p><strong>Henrietta Inman, cookbook author, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/henriettainman/?hl=en\">@henriettainman</a><br></strong>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4 and line a tray with parchment paper. Mix 300g of any flour (wholemeal, white, spelt, rye, gluten-free, ground nuts, desiccated coconut, oats, buckwheat \u2026) with 150g-200g of unsalted butter and 80-100g of whatever sweetness you have (any sugar, honey, maple syrup \u2026) in a free-standing mixer or with your fingertips, until it resembles breadcrumbs. Spread over the tray and bake for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Remove from the oven, chop up a little and return to the oven and bake for a further 10 minutes or until golden. Serve as is, or with fresh fruit and yoghurt, compote and cream, creme fraiche, honey and orange zest, ice cream and chocolate sauce \u2026 (You can also add anything from lemon or orange zest, vanilla, a pinch of salt, a handful of nuts or seeds, a few tsp cocoa powder, or whatever you think might work to the crumble mix).</p> <h2>Berries with chocolate mousse</h2> <p><strong>Cori Pim-Keirle, @coriandercooks<br></strong>Arrange 150g of pitted cherries, raspberries or strawberries in the bottom of of serving dishes. Melt 100g of dark chocolate in a bain marie, then set aside to cool. Pour 170ml of aquafaba (the liquid drained from a can of chickpeas) into the bowl of a stand mixer and whip on full speed until firm peaks form (This will take quite a lot longer than it would with egg whites.) Stir a large dollop of this into the cooled, melted chocolate to lighten it before very carefully folding in the rest. Be as gentle as possible to minimise any loss of air. Divide the mousse evenly over the fruit and chill for several hours to set.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2020 because an earlier version gave incorrect instructions for the feta-filled potato pops recipe.</p>",

But it\u2019s to save the economy and we applaud the government for doing it.</p> \n  <p> But you and I lived through the largesse of the Rudd government with what happened with the financial crisis then. Are you at all concerned, as I am, the way it\u2019s been dealt with, that there may be some opportunity for the dudders to take hold? Because you know and I know every time, whether it\u2019s NDIS, whether it\u2019s preschools, whether it\u2019s childcare centres, as soon as the government says we\u2019re going to fund something, some low bludger formulates a plan to steal money from us? And I\u2019m fearful that even if a small amount of money is stolen \u2013 we\u2019re talking about billions of dollars being stolen \u2013 are you fearful we got a job in front of us to keep the lid on it?</p> \n  <p> <strong>Peter Dutton: Ray, it\u2019s a good point actually because we\u2019ve established a taskforce with the Australian Federal Police and investigators within Centrelink and within Services Australia because there will be an element of fraud</strong>, and those people need to hear a very clear message that now, more than ever, you are more likely to be caught and now more than ever, you have incredible scrutiny on these payments and if people do the wrong thing, then they can expect a search warrant to be executed by the Federal Police or they can expect their assets to be frozen.</p> \n  <p> There are other cases we\u2019re looking at, I was only looking at this morning in terms of people committing fraud against Australian taxpayers, against the commonwealth, and the police will restrain assets. They\u2019ll move very quickly to charge those people that have deliberately done the wrong thing. There will be those people that claim with good intent and they\u2019ve done the wrong thing, the money will have to be repaid and they\u2019ll go through all of that process, but the people you\u2019re talking about, the criminals, who would exploit the system, the technology that we\u2019ve got now to apply algorithms, look at transfers, to look at the way in which money is being diverted to different shelf companies, etc, those people are going to be under a lot of scrutiny. So, I think they should think twice about what they\u2019re doing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T03:00:36.095Z\">at 4.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9675618f082c29014b1122\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T02:51:53.995Z\">3.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">AFP fraud 'taskforce' questions</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Last week, <strong>Peter Dutton </strong>had his regular love in with Sydney radio host <strong>Ray Hadley</strong>, where he mentioned a fraud \u201ctaskforce\u201d had been established in the AFP to deal with people who might be trying to rip off either the jobkeeper or jobseeker program.</p> \n  <p>He was pretty definitive about it:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em><strong>We have established a taskforce with the Australian Federal Police and investigators within Centrelink and within Services Australia</strong>, because there will be an element of fraud and those people need to hear a very clear message, that now, more than ever, you are more likely to be caught, and now more than ever, you have incredible scrutiny on these payments, and you can expect a search warrant to be executed by the Australian Federal Police and you can expect your assets to be frozen and there are other cases we are looking at ...</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> So <strong>Paul Karp</strong> and I asked the AFP what was happening with the taskforce.

The entry, search and seizure which occurred on 4 June 2019 were therefore unlawful.

Nor was it necessary to consider the validity of the order that had been made under s 3LA of the Crimes Act requiring Ms Smethurst to give assistance to enable a constable to access, copy or convert data on a computer or data storage device. <strong>The Court unanimously ordered that the warrant be quashed.

  "<p>I\u2019ll tell you in one word why I have never watched Rocky: Ronald Reagan. Sure, the film came out in 1976, before he reached the White House, likewise Rocky II.

Reagan was still president in 1985, the year I finished university \u2013 rolling up forever <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw251471/Gone-with-the-Wind-Ronald-Reagan-Margaret-Thatcher\">my poster of him and Margaret Thatcher in a Gone with the Wind embrace</a> with an atom bomb \u2013 and another Stallone double-punch of Rocky IV and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVUCdy36TKE\">Rambo: First Blood Part II</a> hit the screens in a blaze of commie-bashing glory.

Rambo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe, more accurately, it was Rambo that stopped me watching Rocky. But I blame President Reagan for Rambo. He began office invoking a vigorous America <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpPt7xGx4Xo\">armed with the weapon of freedom</a>. The movie industry interpreted his vision by arming itself with jingoism. Let\u2019s call it Hollywood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZLLKwFpFG4\">Red Dawn</a>.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t some out-of-touch pinko lefty. No. I had surfed Thatcher\u2019s economic revolution: my student house had a rented video recorder. We watched Escape to Victory, the patriotic tale of a simple goalkeeper (Stallone) who defeats the Nazis with cunning, Bobby Moore and Pel\u00e9. We searched the video shop for his other sporting picture, which he wrote and starred in, about an underdog boxer from Philadelphia who unexpectedly gets a shot at the world title. But it was out that day, so we rented First Blood instead, in which a troubled Vietnam vet and his hunting knife defiantly resist bent, rule-breaking lawmen in a forest. It was impressively watchable.</p> <p>That summer, however, a cinema trailer came out for its sequel, Rambo \u2013 with the vet back in the Vietnamese jungle, blasting the People\u2019s Army to hell with a helicopter gunship. There had, I couldn\u2019t help but notice, been a tonal shift.</p> <p>By the time the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_rUNg_eNwE\">Rocky IV trailer</a> appeared soon after, with its stars-and-stripes shorts and Drago the cartoon doped-up Soviet villain, I felt the die was cast. Stallone\u2019s canon was no longer for me \u2013 as if I had fallen on the wrong side of a cultural divide (not unlike Brexiters and Remoaners in 2019) \u2013 and Rocky\u2019s back story got slung out along with it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2zFQmHWVCI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2zFQmHWVCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ding, ding.

It barrelled along with verve, Stallone punched his weight (also, big up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tony-bellew\">Tony Bellew</a>), but I got the distinct feeling I was watching an old story being rehashed \u2013 what cinema psychologists call \u201cStar Wars trilogy syndrome\u201d. I began to feel it was time to settle my score with the original. Lockdown made it happen. I have a Philadelphian friend in the next street. By state law, he is required to own a complete six-film box set of the Rocky saga. I offered to be neighbourly and save him from having to watch it all again. We arranged a safe-distance handover on his doorstep \u2013 and I threw my arms in the air.</p> <p>Of course I did. It\u2019s the most famous scene from the movie, the journeyman boxer\u2019s mazy training run \u2013 set to a stirring theme \u2013 that ends on the steps of the art museum imagining being crowned champion. Tourists, spoofers and comics copy it every week (Rob Brydon did it in The Trip to Greece just the other day). I\u2019d seen it replayed a thousand times. But I wasn\u2019t expecting the film that was wrapped around it.</p> <p>Rocky\u2019s America is bleak \u2013 kitchen-sink drama bleak. He lives in a grimy brown apartment, with just a tankful of turtles, a hi-fi and a colander for company. Outdoors, it\u2019s all trains, postindustrial wastelands and biting cold. The only warmth to be found is at the pet shop, where there are cute puppies and a shy assistant he nurses a passion for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c262b12d4ad42ace1626cd0cc13fd2e727dbf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c262b12d4ad42ace1626cd0cc13fd2e727dbf9/0_0_2576_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warmth \u2026 Rocky takes his girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), to the ice rink.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warmth \u2026 Rocky takes his girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), to the ice rink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aquarius/Allstar/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also comes across as real: working-class lives with small horizons, harsh words and dead-end jobs at the meatpacking factory. It has heart: the boxing promoter who sets up Rocky\u2019s title fight, when a contender drops out, does so with good grace not cynicism; the loan shark Rocky works for gives him cash to spend on training without demanding a return. The fight, when it comes, fills Rocky with self-doubt \u2013 and the outcome is not a sugary victory but a personal triumph. He goes the distance, proves something to himself, and wins the girl. Good on you, Italian Stallion.</p> <p>I\u2019m not surprised it won a sentimental Academy Award. Even though it\u2019s hard and grubby, it\u2019s a more heartening vision of America than the ones on show in its best picture Oscar rivals, Network and All the President\u2019s Men (or, indeed, Carrie and Taxi Driver, which tussled for prizes that year, too). I\u2019m not surprised, either, that Americans ended up demanding a more colourful future.</p> <p>Since I had the box set \u2026 I watched Rocky IV as well. It is truly terrible. In a world no longer just brown and grey, Rocky\u2019s house is a Greek-columned mansion with a Lamborghini on the drive, a robot butler and an immigrant housekeeper to manage the colanders. He wears Hugo Boss sweatshirts. The story unfolds in one synthpop-video montage after another. And, of course, he beats the commie who\u2019s nine feet taller than him and could knock a rhino out cold, because Rocky is an American filled with the power of freedom.</p> <p>One last thing: in the fascinating <a href=\"https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sreference/films-viewed-by-president-and-mrs-reagan\">official list of films</a> Ronald and Nancy Reagan watched during his office on their weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/movie-night-with-the-reagans\">movie nights</a>, Rambo does not appear. They watched Rocky III, though, and Rocky IV (followed the night after by Hannah and Her Sisters). In a divided world, even hyper-nationalists need some light relief.</p>",
  "<p>The apocalypse needs to end. Anyone who writes about apocalypse today is bound to acknowledge that humans have worried and theorised about it for as long as they have worried and theorised about anything; at some point, the writer is guaranteed to employ the word \u201ceschatological\u201d as a nod to the fact that apocalypse is an essential principle of major and minor religions. Yet for a foundational concept it\u2019s quite hard to pin down. Just as \u201creality\u201d is elusive in a once-fragmented world that has (very creatively) reassembled itself online, the apocalypse can apply to whatever you want it to: the Greek root means to uncover or reveal, hence the Book of Revelation, hence the hard truths we learn about humanity\u2019s consequential inaction in every apocalypse story. Marxist revolution can be an apocalypse; relationship experts speak about the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d of divorce. Apocalypse is a shifting abstraction, a deceptively neat encapsulation of cascading associations and ideas. The End is endlessly debatable, everywhere and nowhere, relative, adaptable, accommodating to many levels of interpretation. As the funny refrain in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s apocalyptic film <em>Parasite</em> goes, it\u2019s \u201cso metaphorical\u201d.</p> <p>This is not how many people see it. Along with evangelical Christians, doomsday preppers, and bored Silicon Valley billionaires scheming to colonise Mars or flee to New Zealand, the popular imagination has a pretty intuitive grasp of the apocalypse: it refers to the end of the world, or at least human civilisation. The destruction of everything, or enough of everything that it is impossible to rebuild anything good. According to a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/03/18/apocalypse-climate-change-pandemic-coronavirus\">YouGov poll</a> conducted in February of this year, 29% of Americans believe an \u201capocalyptic disaster\u201d will occur at some point during their lifetime; given Greta Thunberg\u2019s popularity, it\u2019s fair to say that many more believe one will take place within their children\u2019s lifetimes. (A majority of those polled by YouGov believed they could survive a week or less after apocalyptic disaster, a self-awareness I find heartening.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba40d0e1042b773bc5de43b1711b261c55649523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba40d0e1042b773bc5de43b1711b261c55649523/0_87_2732_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s \u2018so metaphorical!\u2019: <em>Parasite</em>, directed by Bong Joon-ho, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curzon Artificial Eye/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even lovers of hermeneutics will hedge their bets. After all, a non-metaphorical apocalypse could result from a few types of disaster, arriving suddenly or accumulating gradually over time: climate catastrophe; a nuclear war; an unlikely asteroid; a pandemic \u2013 likely not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the current one</a> \u2013 that can\u2019t be contained. While most stories that imagine the apocalypse are not realistic (zombies are another metaphor, the rapid-onset ice age depicted in <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em> a misguided extrapolation, and the Bible not in fact meant to be taken literally) the anxiety that surrounds them comes from a deep sense of pragmatism. Prevailing opinion these days is that the apocalypse is not only going to take place, it\u2019s more likely to take place than ever, especially if you plot the rate of its increasing likelihood on a logarithmic scale very few people know how to read. Plots of all kinds tend to make people very excited. If the worst <em>could </em>happen, it only makes sense that you should act as if it <em>will</em>. Especially if you have children.</p> <p>Here lies the conflict at the centre of Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s new book, <em>Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back</em>. The indefinite article, \u201can\u201d apocalypse, provides a clue to his inclinations. He has a PhD in English literature and notes that \u201cthroughout my 20s and into my 30s, the writers who seemed to me to possess the truest vision of the world \u2026 were those who rejected most thoroughly the idea that life might be on aggregate a good thing\u201d. Yet we encounter him hovering uneasily in the space between theory and reality, existing in the break of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming\">WB Yeats\u2019s line</a>, \u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity\u201d. The merely intellectual approach, untested by actually pressing circumstances, has lately been failing him. On-the-nose signs of impending doom are all around, bombarding him with images of contemporary discord, and they\u2019re really freaking him out.</p> <p>Given its publication date in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, critics are calling this book timely, appropriate and prescient. Though the possibility of a pandemic only comes up occasionally in the book, as one option in a series of hypothetical catastrophes, current events generally support O\u2019Connell\u2019s attitude, which is that any collapse will be the result of a complicated system of effects from which a single cause cannot be determined. (If he had to say, though, he would likely reply: \u201cBecause capitalism\u201d.) \u201cIt was the end of the world, and I was sitting on the couch watching cartoons with my son,\u201d O\u2019Connell writes. As his son giggles at the show, about a little girl and \u201cthe comic scrapes she gets embroiled in with her long-suffering bear companion\u201d, dad holds his phone \u2013 \u201cmy eschatology handset, my streaming service of last things\u201d \u2013 above his child\u2019s head, scrolling through Twitter. He stumbles on a video advertised as \u201csoul-crushing\u201d and \u201cheart-wrenching\u201d; naturally, he clicks. Set to a \u201cslow and mournful glissando\u201d played by a cello, the video warns of the effects of climate change and features an \u201cemaciated polar bear dragging itself across a rocky terrain\u201d in search of a morsel of sustenance. It gives O\u2019Connell \u201cmoral vertigo, resulting from the fact that the very technology that allowed me to witness the final pathetic tribulations of this emaciated beast was in fact a cause of the animal\u2019s suffering in the first place\u201d. The \u201cabsurd juxtaposition\u201d of cartoon and real bear makes him feel \u201ca surge of shame and sadness at the world my son would be forced to live in, a shame and sadness that I in turn was passing on to him\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f35d7eb9a0b469291644f9d437c7b146e5aa0622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f35d7eb9a0b469291644f9d437c7b146e5aa0622/1188_218_4139_2485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polar bear on the outskirts of the Russian industrial city of Norilsk, June 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polar bear on the outskirts of the Russian industrial city of Norilsk, June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Irina Yarinskaya/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the end of 2016, \u201cthe winter of an ignoble year\u201d, when \u201cthe more or less hourly vibration in my pocket was a kind of post-traumatic thrum, a bracing for whatever fresh hell I was about to peer into.\u201d Were he childless, or less aware of the reality that humanity demonstrates a horrible resilience in the face of struggle, and suffering is often never redeemed, he\u2019d probably prefer to die in the apocalypse than to pursue whatever violent, desperate life might come after, not that he would have much choice in the matter. \u201cWhatever form the apocalypse came in,\u201d he tells a friend who admits to keeping a well-stocked \u201cgo-bag\u201d under her bed, \u201cI would almost certainly be in the first wave of deaths. We both laughed, but I think she knew that I was not entirely joking.\u201d Unsettled, he muses that, \u201cas an individual, as a parent, I wanted the world to live on after me \u2026 But perhaps the reasons for my interest in the end of the world were more complicated than I was prepared to acknowledge. Perhaps my terrors and my desires were more intimately related than I knew.\u201d</p> <p>The last four years have seen a spate of articles wondering, in the age of climate crisis and denial: \u201cIs it OK to have a child?\u201d Most writers decide it is, coalescing around the joy of family as a collective good and the (unproven) belief that parenthood may spur people to action on behalf of their children. In 2016 O\u2019Connell\u2019s son is already three, so gaming out the ethics of reproduction is not a thought experiment he bothers long with. This is the closest thing he has to pressing circumstances \u2013 for now \u2013 so instead he sets out on a series of \u201cperverse pilgrimages\u201d to \u201clandscapes both real and imaginary where the end of the world could be glimpsed\u201d. The internet is followed by a sojourn to the South Dakota prairie, where a former army munitions facility is being transformed into a \u201csurvival shelter community\u201d of customisable bunkers for obnoxious upper-middle-class preppers, whose notoriously overboard internet rabbit holes O\u2019Connell has also explored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b90ba5171849b80683452af7a6cab235698077d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b90ba5171849b80683452af7a6cab235698077d3/0_497_6637_3983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doomsday community: Vivos xPoint survival shelters in South Dakota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doomsday community: Vivos xPoint survival shelters in South Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then he goes to New Zealand, which truly rich libertarian venture capitalists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/15/why-silicon-valley-billionaires-are-prepping-for-the-apocalypse-in-new-zealand\">Peter Thiel</a> have designated the optimal place to wait out \u201csystemic collapse\u201d \u2013 and where professed socialists such as O\u2019Connell might see the Second Coming in their progressive young prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who has explicity prioritised her citizens\u2019 wellbeing over economic growth. At a conference on Mars colonialisation in Los Angeles he attends a talk called \u201cLiberty in Space\u201d and reflects on how the \u201cfundamentally male narrative of exit, of escape as a means toward the nobility of self-determination\u201d dovetails with American capitalism; if Mars is the backup when Earth is uninhabitable, someone is going to have to be in charge of it.</p> <p>On a camping retreat in a remote, rewilded area of the Scottish Highlands \u2013 arranged by a group that believes climate catastrophe is \u201cinevitable\u201d, so people should \u201chope beyond hope\u201d for a better world to come by learning to reintegrate with nature \u2013 he reflects on Dr Seuss\u2019s classic climate-change parable, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/20/the-lorax-dr-seuss-old-vic-review\">The Lorax</a></em>, which he has read to his son. Finally, he and a friend visit the Chernobyl exclusion zone, where they take a depressing guided tour through what he sees as both \u201cthe ruins of a collapsed utopian project, a vast crumbling monument to an abandoned past\u201d and \u201can immersive simulation of the future, an image of what will come in our wake\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of area to cover between not yet and too late. O\u2019Connell zigzags across it many times, but he sticks to well-trodden paths, from relatable observations about his own ultimately hypocrisies to theoretical interpretations: the apocalypse as patriarchy, as white-supremacy, as colonialism, as genocide, as luxury consumerism, as a projection of the individual\u2019s anxiety about his own death, as \u201cnostalgia for the future\u201d. (Thankfully, there are no charts attempting to represent messianic time.) After apologising for travelling to all the locations in the book by plane, acknowledging his carbon footprint is \u201cas broad and deep and indelible as my guilt\u201d, he declares: \u201cMy days are a procession of last things, seals opened. I myself am the apocalypse of which I speak. That is the prophecy of this book.\u201d</p> <p>By the end, he fulfils this prophecy by ending up where he started, looking at the news on his phone, but he feels better. \u201cI wonder now whether it is because of or despite the strange series of pilgrimages I have been on that I have come at last to this place of accommodation \u2026 it became apparent to me that a state of perpetual anxiety was no way to live. It constituted a kind of retreat, and that that retreat was a kind of dying.\u201d Through what he thinks could be \u201cexposure therapy\u201d, he\u2019s learned to accept that \u201cwe have no idea what might come to pass\u201d, but in the meantime being alive is at least \u201cinteresting\u201d, in the precocious words of his young son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa770d93f3b454bf0e2789c50506e9147c1dd637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa770d93f3b454bf0e2789c50506e9147c1dd637/0_94_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pripyat, in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

Persistently high levels of radiation make the area uninhabitable for thousands of years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a blurb, the novelist Jenny Offill describes O\u2019Connell as \u201ca genius guide through all the circles of imagined or anticipated doom\u201d, and reading his descriptions of his tour of Chernobyl, I thought the word \u201cguide\u201d was very apt. At one point, the group goes into an abandoned school and finds a room in which \u201ca dozen or so toddler-size chairs were arranged in a circle, and on each was perched a rotting doll or distempered teddy bear\u201d. O\u2019Connell has the \u201cunsettling\u201d realisation that \u201cthis scene had been carefully arranged by a visitor, probably quite recently, precisely in order for it to be photographed\u201d. A guide\u2019s job is to show you what you expect, just more so: a representation of reality that emphasises what you always believed. It rarely has much to do with the guide\u2019s own life.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As the literary critic<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/05/frank-kermode-interview-christopher-tayler\"> Frank Kermode</a> had it, the apocalypse is a fiction, one that lends humanity a \u201csense of an ending\u201d. In his book of that name, Kermode argued that \u201ccrisis is a way of thinking about one\u2019s moment, and not inherent in the moment itself\u201d. Man arrives in the world <em>in media res</em>, and the apocalypse is a \u201ccoherent pattern\u201d he follows to create \u201cconsonance\u201d from the discord inherent in the individual\u2019s relationship to the world. (This is also why, when doomsday preppers get the date of the Rapture wrong, they always claim it was due to an interpretative or mathematical error \u2013 never because the myth is bunk.) We think about the world as a book, in other words, and \u201cone of the great charms of books is that they have to end\u201d, Kermode writes.</p> <p>The role of the critic is important here; he must stand outside the paradigm to \u201cmake sense of the ways in which we try to make sense of our lives\u201d. Near the beginning of his book, O\u2019Connell half-jokingly poses that the apocalyptic fantasies he grew up with in the 1980s were superior to the slow, painful climate collapse facing us today. \u201cNuclear war \u2026 adhered to certain established narrative conventions,\u201d he writes. \u201cYou had near misses, global panics \u2026 You had plot, was what you had: you had drama. And even more crucially, you had characters.\u201d He goes on to suggest that a crucial difference between the cold war and global warming is that in the cold war, most people were \u201cnot among the protagonists and antagonists\u201d, but \u201cbystanders, whose role was limited to cowering in terror\u201d. The trouble with the real apocalypse, he suggests, is that we are all authors of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>O'Connell doesn\u2019t portray himself as a critic, or an author \u2013 he portrays himself as the protagonist of a novel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this is a fiction, too \u2013 one that makes consonant our individual feelings of power and agency within the overwhelming global system of capital in which we are each insignificant. It\u2019s easily translated into the moral of <em>The Lorax</em>, which O\u2019Connell relies on for his hopeful conclusion: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d (Similarly, we would like to think decreasing carbon emissions is as simple as convincing enough people to stop travelling by plane.)</p> <p>It follows, then, that for much of the book, O\u2019Connell doesn\u2019t portray himself as a critic, or an author \u2013 he portrays himself as the protagonist of a novel. He can\u2019t help but frame the story as a reluctant hero\u2019s journey, a mid-life <em>Bildungsroman</em>. He notes that his usage of the word \u201cpilgrimages\u201d to describe his project is \u201cweirdly religious, even self-aggrandising\u201d, but nevertheless feels it\u2019s too apt to abandon. \u201cI was looking for something in these places, for some kind of enlightenment or edification or even solace.\u201d As he peppers the text with explicit literary references, he also finds himself in situations that quietly imitate art: among others, there are parallels to fictions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/03/ben-lerner-1004-novel-books-interview\">Ben Lerner</a> and L\u00e1szl\u00f3<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/may/20/man-booker-international-prize-laszlo-krasznahorkai-who-he-is-and-why-you-should-read-him\"> Krasznahorkai</a>, whom Susan Sontag called the \u201cmaster of the apocalypse\u201d. Signs, symbols, explanations of those signs and symbols, and incredible coincidences abound, so often that I suspected O\u2019Connell must have compressed, massaged, or otherwise altered what actually happened to fit the story he wanted to tell. At first, I wondered if his high-flown language was a wink at the gravity apocalypse inspires in people; as the book went on, I had to admit he was mostly serious.</p> <p>In order to create the illusion of seamlessness between his experiences and his thoughts, he\u2019s constantly \u201crealising\u201d things in scene, or else considering them, remembering them, being struck by them, or having them occur to him, though it seems likely he came up with them when reporting was done and he was toiling at his desk. I\u2019m sceptical they just appeared in his mind while he was zoning out at the Heathrow Yo! Sushi. Perhaps these are intended as little apocalypses, to suggest that serious thinking can lead to a break or rupture in one\u2019s life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25143d18d39085d61f549179bea5910d4cefc1ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25143d18d39085d61f549179bea5910d4cefc1ac/0_0_4531_2720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, at a forum on entrepreneurship and investment in Beijing, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, at a forum on entrepreneurship and investment in Beijing, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VCG/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But most damning is his treatment of other people, which reveals a more significant hypocrisy than claiming to care about the environment while still using an iPhone, the production of which destroys the world. Like his children, his subjects do not ever resemble real people but instead only ever serve some specific, singular purpose in the narrative. Thiel, for example, is \u201ca figure of almost cartoonishly outsized villainy \u2026 a human emblem of the moral vortex at the centre of the market\u201d. Most of the women in the book are the same stock character, a reserved sage nodding at O\u2019Connell\u2019s pointlessly spiralling thoughts as she goes on about her more important concerns: care work, sustaining life, \u201cattention\u201d.</p> <p>He introduces his wife as a woman of \u201cunfathomable resilience and practical wisdom, to whom such fugue states of panic and epochal despair were essentially foreign\u201d; she forbids him from bringing thoughts of <em>peripeteia</em> into the home. On his wilderness retreat, a rugged Australian woman helps him set up his tent and avoids embarrassing him with \u201cempathic skilfulness\u201d by explaining that she used to work at a camping store. (He then explains why this is so empathic and skilful.) Even his prepper friend with the go-bag is a source of quietly eye-opening higher perspective: when he says he\u2019d prefer to die in the apocalypse than to see what happens afterwards, she gently points out that women are \u201calready halfway to a dystopia. If she got raped tomorrow, for instance, she was by no means confident that she would go to the cops about it.\u201d</p> <p>In her 1965 essay \u201cThe Imagination of Disaster\u201d, Sontag wrote that fantasy allows us to cope with life \u201cunder continual threat of two equally fearful, but seemingly opposed, destinies: unremitting banality and inconceivable terror\u201d. When we fail to understand the relationship between fiction and reality, this coping mechanism stops working: all fictions become myths and prophesies. As we tear through history searching for some model to deal with pressing contemporary problems, \u201cprescience\u201d has emerged as the be-all and end-all of artistic accomplishment, inspiring in audiences almost quasi-religious admiration for \u201cvisionary\u201d talents. (Kermode points out that the phrase \u201cbe-all and end-all\u201d reflects a \u201cpregnant conflation of crisis and an end immanent in it\u201d. Shakespeare came up with it, in <em>Macbeth</em>.)</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like Harry Potter, <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em>, <em>The Matrix</em>, and <em>Contagion</em>!\u201d social media users marvel when a news item resembles the plots of those stories. To treat these stories as prophesies is to miss the point of fictions completely. They\u2019re supposed to be like life. By attempting to make the reverse true, to make reality fit into a fiction, O\u2019Connell hasn\u2019t really overcome his apocalyptic imagination. He has just passed it off to someone else.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><em>Notes from an Apocalypse is published by Granta (RRP \u00a314.99).</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020 to correct two instances where the word \u201cprophesy\u201d was used when \u201cprophecy\u201d was meant.</p>",

But Britons guard their privacy jealously, at least outside wartime. It\u2019s surprising, then, how little debate there has been about the electronic surveillance culture this epidemic threatens to bring with it.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about police sending up drones to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/26/police-drone-video-shames-people-using-national-park-during-uk-lockdown-video\">shame</a> Peak District ramblers, or threatening to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52245937\">snoop</a> through supermarket shoppers\u2019 trolleys to check their trips were really necessary, but about what happens after lockdown is over. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/uk-app-to-track-coronavirus-spread-to-be-launched\">confirmed</a> at the weekend that the government is seeking to develop a phone app allowing people to record their own symptoms, and receive alerts if other users they\u2019ve been in contact with have fallen ill. Well, of course he did: this is the man who once invented the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt\">Matt Hancock app</a>, for everyone desperate to keep up with all the Matt Hancock news. But what if this is more about Matt Hancock keeping up with you?</p> <p>Any future tracing app would almost certainly be voluntary in Britain, with strict confidentiality promised to protect users\u2019 privacy. It could be a godsend for people with vulnerable relatives, giving early warning of any brush with the virus that would help them to avoid unwittingly passing it on. True, we\u2019d be meekly handing over intimate details of our movements and social circles to an alliance of government and tech companies, but arguably that\u2019s no more information than we blithely give away by opening Google Maps or Facebook. Like staying home to save lives, getting the app could become seen as the socially responsible thing to do, helping save jobs by allowing a gradual return to normal while lowering the risk of reigniting infection. But, given that this could be a far longer lasting change to everyday life than lockdown, it\u2019s staggering how little we have been prepared for it.</p> <p>In authoritarian states such as Russia or China, the fear is surely that tracking systems could be abused. When Chinese citizens with a green code (for low infection risk) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/growth-in-surveillance-may-be-hard-to-scale-back-after-coronavirus-pandemic-experts-say\">can go out</a>, while a yellow or red code (denoting contact with an infected person, or confirmed infections) means restrictions, how easy would it be to punish political dissidents by tampering with their codes to keep them under effective house arrest?</p> <p>In Britain, the worry is more that everyday life could swiftly become difficult for those unwilling to sign up. Even if it\u2019s strictly voluntary, are we so sure that unscrupulous employers wouldn\u2019t demand applicants install the app as a condition of hiring, that rogue landlords won\u2019t try to discriminate against tenants who can\u2019t show they have it, that insurers won\u2019t seek to restrict health cover accordingly? Could airlines insist you get it before you fly, to protect fellow passengers? The risk is of creating another kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a> for those who resist. And that\u2019s to say nothing of questions about what access the security services might eventually seek to the data, or whether electronic tracking could become a habit that sticks once the epidemic is over. (Maybe road pricing isn\u2019t so dead after all.)</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see why government doesn\u2019t want to have this conversation now, arguing that talk of exit strategies risks distracting from core messages about staying home. Although Dominic Raab is expected to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-lockdown/britain-to-remain-in-lockdown-till-at-least-may-7-the-times-idUSKCN21V257\">announce</a> on Thursday that lockdown won\u2019t be lifted until after 7 May, that\u2019s simply the earliest date for review; there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t drag on longer.</p> <p>Yet the implications of something like this need to be thoroughly explored before we move from blanket lockdown into what could be a more fluid and personalised version, where we might get something like our lives back but have to live with knowing they could be snatched away again. Ironically, it\u2019s probably those libertarians howling loudest for an end to lockdown now who\u2019d naturally hate the idea, while for others it will sound like a price worth paying for escape. Right now, I\u2019d probably download it like a shot. But until some basic questions are answered, we just don\u2019t know what we might be sacrificing for freedom.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>From an outside perspective, South African cinema tends to announce itself through occasional breakout films rather than consistently visible directorial careers. Back in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080801/\">The Gods Must Be Crazy</a> was a global hit that didn\u2019t do much to raise the profile of its director, Jamie Uys. Fourteen years ago, gritty township fable <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468565/\">Tsotsi</a> won the country one of its first Oscars, only to send director Gavin Hood directly into a proficient but culturally anonymous Hollywood career.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3564996/\">Oliver Hermanus</a>, however, the country has produced its most significant auteur in several generations. The 36-year-old Capetonian studied at the London Film School, but returned home for his art. His 2009 graduation film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483507/\">Shirley Adams</a>, a tough-minded mother-son portrait set on the Cape Flats, set the tone for a career marked by global critical acclaim. He stepped up to Cannes with his follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/19/beauty-review\">Beauty</a>, a startling study of a closeted Afrikaner that made it to UK cinemas; his third film, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/venice-film-review-the-endless-river-1201587241/\">The Endless River</a>, did not.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/04/moffie-review-south-africa-soldiers-homophobia-apartheid-oliver-hermanus\">Moffie</a>, Hermanus\u2019s poetic yet visceral fourth feature, feels like the one that will cement him in the contemporary arthouse canon. A war film that returns to the anxious queer terrain of Beauty, it has been collecting awards and plaudits \u2013 including three <a href=\"https://www.bifa.film/film/moffie/\">British Independent Film Award nominations</a> \u2013 since premiering at Venice last autumn. It\u2019s his most pristinely accomplished film yet, though, in its conception at least, not his most personal: it adapts <a href=\"https://www.andrecarlvandermerwe.com/\">Andr\u00e9</a><a href=\"https://www.andrecarlvandermerwe.com/\"> Carl van der Merwe</a>\u2019s semi-autobiographical 2006 novel, based on his experiences as a gay teenage conscript sent to fight in the South African Border War in the early 1980s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a5a49efe54eb1527f1d727549bbf67ad3d40ac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a5a49efe54eb1527f1d727549bbf67ad3d40ac4/0_112_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Oliver Hermanus at the Venice Film Festival, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018South African film still seems to exist very much within racial boundaries\u2019 ... director Oliver Hermanus at the 2019 Venice Film Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A gay director born after the events depicted in the film, Hermanus was intrigued by the possibilities of exploring a regimented realm denied to men of colour in the apartheid era, while finding common ground in his closeted white protagonist\u2019s suffering under a vicious Afrikaner patriarchy. \u201cThe subject matter did bother me at first,\u201d he says from his home outside Cape Town, where he\u2019s self-isolating under coronavirus lockdown. \u201cIt was my mum who actually said to me, \u2018Why make another film about white men in apartheid South Africa?\u2019</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mum said: 'Why make another film about a white man in apartheid South Africa?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut the challenge is to find the centre of it that resonates with you completely. And for me, that became not just about the character\u2019s sexuality, but about the shame factor: the fact that under this regime, boys were sort of shamed into becoming a certain kind of man. Because we keep asking the question, especially in South Africa: where does our toxic masculinity come from? When I looked at it that way, when I sort of saw this as an exploration of our past that informs our present, I was more comfortable with it.\u201d</p> <p>Van der Merwe\u2019s novel had a more defined romantic throughline; though Hermanus\u2019s film outlines an attraction between protagonist Nicholas (Kai Luke Brummer) and a fellow misfit recruit, he deliberately downplayed the love story. \u201cA key rule of mine from the very beginning was that there was going to be no kind of conventional love scene: it wasn\u2019t going to be a relationship drama,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was going to be more about our connection to this problematic era, and the generation of men who lived through that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5fae811811a5ee52fe7e17fd9bcf24989455e5d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fae811811a5ee52fe7e17fd9bcf24989455e5d1/0_33_1620_972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There wasn\u2019t going to be a conventional love scene\u2019 ...

Kai Luke Brummer, left, in Moffie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Rutland Manners/Curzon Artificial Eye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In doing so, Hermanus was prepared to be confrontational \u2013 taking the book\u2019s title, a common Afrikaans anti-gay slur, as his cue on that front. \u201cI know it\u2019s a very triggering film \u2013 it had to be,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an overwhelming range of reactions to the film in South Africa: some from gay men who had been to the army and felt identified and recognised, some from men who don\u2019t necessarily acknowledge the fact that they are still traumatised. One member of the press had a panic attack at a screening. These are common experiences but they haven\u2019t been widely addressed in South African culture.\u201d</p> <p>Though the film is set in the whites-only domain of the army, Hermanus doesn\u2019t skimp on depicting anti-black violence: \u201cIt was a dangerous choice, I know, to have all of the black characters be physical objects, victimised on the sidelines. But that\u2019s how it was: there\u2019s a white gaze there, and we needed to see that.\u201d He cites inspiration from the 2010 Abdellatif Kechiche historical drama <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/black-venus-film-review-30066\">Black Venus</a> \u2013 which depicted the white objectification and abuse of black South African performer Saartjie Baartman, to divisive effect.</p> <p>Hermanus is prepared for pushback on the point of view he\u2019s taken, but doesn\u2019t see South African cinema evolving via kid-glove treatment of its own ugly history. \u201cThe challenge in the South African film landscape right now is that it still seems to exist very much within racial boundaries: white money making nostalgia pieces for white people that are devoid of black people, and then you\u2019ve got black film-makers making romantic comedies and genre films about black lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThe films I make don\u2019t really exist in that market. And then I didn\u2019t want to make a safe film like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/02/mandela-long-walk-freedom-review\">Long Walk to Freedom</a>, where you kind of get everyone\u2019s perspective on everything.</p> <p>\u201cSo I decided we were going to put the world in the headspace of white South Africa in the 80s, to show what that looked like from the inside,\u201d he concludes. Moffie delivers vividly and discomfitingly on that promise: Hermanus continues to make films that feel as bracing and urgent to locals as to international onlookers.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-moffie-film-online\">Moffie is released on 24 April</a> on Curzon Home Cinema.</p></li> </ul>"
