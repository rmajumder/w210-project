Confirmed infections are nearing 3.4 million, with 6,378,239 so dar.</li> <li><strong>Brazil deaths passed 30,000. </strong>A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.</li> <li><strong>Australia\u2019s economy is in recession. </strong>Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has confirmed Australia is now in a recession as the economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic. His confirmation came after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jun/03/coronavirus-australia-latest-updates-unions-employers-industrial-relations-jobs-covid-19-nsw-queensland-victoria-travel-borders-restrictions-live-news?page=with:block-5ed6fdaa8f087122eca54777#block-5ed6fdaa8f087122eca54777\">economy shrank by 0.3% in the March quarter</a>, on the back of the bushfires, drought and coronavirus pandemic. Asked whether the country was now in recession, he said: \u201cWell, the answer to that is \u2018yes\u2019. And that is on the basis of the advice that I have from the Treasury department about where the June quarter is expected to be.\u201d</li> <li><strong>New Zealand saw its 12th consecutive day with no new cases. </strong>New Zealand has reported a 12th straight day of no new cases of Covid-19, as the government considers abandoning as early as next week all remaining restrictions on the country except stringent border controls. Just one person in New Zealand is still recovering from the illness, health officials said on Wednesday. They are not in hospital. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, with 22 deaths.</li> <li><strong>French anti-racism protesters defied a coronavirus gathering ban. </strong>Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of a black man in police custody, galvanised by US demonstrations against racism and deadly police violence. <br></li> <li><strong>China\u2019s service sector is bouncing back. </strong>China\u2019s huge service sector has bounced back to growth for the first time since January in a sign that the world\u2019s second largest economy is recovering strongly from strict coronavirus-induced containment measures. Although employment and overseas demand remains weak in the economy, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, hitting the highest level since late 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. </li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/yemen-faces-macabre-tragedy-as-aid-funding-falls-short-by-1bn\">Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn</a>. </strong>Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen\">a humanitarian fundraising summit</a> raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war.</li> <li><strong>Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine.</strong> A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year.</li> <li><strong>France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days.</strong> It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures.</li> <li><strong>Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period </strong>since its outbreak began, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March.</li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, </strong>its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state.</li> <li><strong> </strong><strong>The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics</strong>. The total differs from the government\u2019s daily counts, which only include deaths in hospitals and care homes where the person had tested positive.</li> <li><strong>The UK statistics watchdog criticised the government\u2019s testing data. </strong>Whitehall\u2019s use of testing data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97#block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\">appears to be aimed more at making it look like a lot is being done</a> than actually painting a clear picture, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock.</li> <li><strong>A Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week</strong>, Chinese state media reported.

According to researchers from Johns Hopkins University, 6,340,811 people are known to have been infected, while 378,359 are known to have died since the outbreak began.<br></li> <li><strong>Brazil deaths pass 30,000. </strong>A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/yemen-faces-macabre-tragedy-as-aid-funding-falls-short-by-1bn\">Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn</a>. </strong>Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen\">a humanitarian fundraising summit</a> raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war. </li> <li><strong>Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine.</strong> A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year.</li> <li><strong>France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days.</strong> It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures.</li> <li><strong>Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period since its outbreak began</strong>, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March.</li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced</strong>. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state.</li> <li><strong>The pandemic is exposing \u201cendemic inequalities\u201d that must be addressed, according to the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet</strong>, who highlighted the protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd and data showing the crisis has had a worse impact on ethnic minority groups.</li> <li><strong>The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics</strong>.

  "<p>If, like me, you are a media consumer of a certain age and have come late to the Canadian crime drama Cardinal (BBC Two), let me save you a few minutes of distraction as the question niggles at the back of your atrophying mind. John Cardinal, Algonquin Bay\u2019s stoic, rugged detective \u2013 currently grieving for his wife, Catherine (murdered last series by a rogue psychologist), and haunted by his inability to avert her death \u2013 is played by Billy Campbell. Yes, the Rocketeer. Yes, we have lived so long.</p> <p>Matched by an equally strong, understated performance from Karine Vanasse as his Quebecois partner Lise Delorme, he is embarking on a fourth series \u2013 adapted from <a href=\"https://www.fantasticfiction.com/b/giles-blunt/john-cardinal/\">the novels by Giles Blunt</a> \u2013 of slow, serious sleuthing against the breathtaking snow-covered backdrop of Northern Ontario.</p> <p>It is generally an unbearable piece of pseudery to say that the location of a programme is another one of its characters (OMG! NYC just WAS the fifth lady in SATC!) but in Cardinal it is very close to the truth. The relentless freezing temperatures constrain people at every turn. Even murderers must plan ahead and bring snowsuits for those they kidnap from their homes if they want them to stay alive long enough to make a ransom video. Everyone must don their parkas or hurry between car and truck lest mother nature, rather than a vengeful killer, get them.</p> <p>It adds a sense of scale and an intensity to the (lean, muted) action that US or UK equivalents have to struggle to achieve. The petty vengeances of man play out against the ultimate, implacable, uncaring foe. The unforgiving cold freezes corpses in painful attitudes, fresh snowfall obscures tracks that might have led somewhere or to someone. A weak spot in the ice and you are done for. Nature does not care.</p> <p>So it is up to Cardinal and Delorme to make meaning and insist that murder matters. This time it is a high-profile lawyer \u2013 crown prosecutor Robert Quillen \u2013 who is abducted from a hotel room where he had just enjoyed an assignation with a woman not his wife. The only possible clue is a single brown feather. His wife, Sheila Gagne (a politician, played by Carmen Moore, who attracts her own fair share of enemies), assures the detectives that they had an open marriage and that she knew about the date, but his lover\u2019s husband did not.</p> <p>When Sheila gets a ransom call from an unidentified man, she pays it without consulting the detective duo, but they track the payment to a man called Wade, who promises he can tell them where Robert is. Cut a deal, he says, and they will find the lawyer before he dies.</p> <p>Alas, Wade is knifed through the brainstem before his knowledge can be disbursed. Robert is found chained to a log, dead from exposure. A second victim follows in the next episode (shown as an opening double bill). With no apparent connection between the dead, the detectives turn to Sheila\u2019s past for clues. Never trust a politician. You probably do not need to be told this.</p> <p>Cardinal provides that rare pleasure: a sense of something being better than it needs to be. It is slow without being frustrating or dull, thoughtful without being ponderous or pretentious. It has a further advantage of basically adhering to a known formula while sitting slightly at odds with it. There is a continual piquing of interest at odd moments. When they draw guns on Wade at his arrest, not knowing if he is armed, it is done calmly, almost regretfully, instead of in a flurry of testosterone and shouted instructions. A search takes place on snowbikes and using infrared drones to cover the vast area. Scandi noir is more obviously foreign, but this is all the more discombobulating for being so nearly everything we expect and yet not quite.</p> <p>Even the unresolved sexual tension between Cardinal and Delorme, which has woven in and out of the preceding series, is a little different. It is a little more grown up, a little sadder, a little more based in yearning than lust. It is also getting a little closer to being resolved. Cardinal agrees to go home with Delorme after a hard, cold day\u2019s murder-tracking and \u2013 well, look, it is all in the glance between them on the doorstep, which I am not going to ruin by rendering into mere words. But then they are called on their phones with news of the case and they step out of the little oasis of warmth momentarily created between them to get back to work. But if a parka or two is not unzipped by the end of the series, I shall be most surprised. Come on, Rocketeer.</p>",

  "<p>This was the phantom announcement of the phantom Cannes. A cancelled Christmas when all we got in our stockings was a list of the presents we\u2019re not getting.</p> <p>After the ending of the festival that never was, this was a ghostly \u2013 and rather fascinating \u2013&nbsp;construction of the event that traditionally happens one month beforehand: the announcement of the official selection. These were the films that would have been at Cannes, and we\u2019ll never know what categories they would have played in, when they were scheduled to play: which would have bagged the first weekend? We\u2019ll never know how each would have gone down for each nailbiting red-carpet gala; we\u2019ll never know how the alchemy of Cannes would have fizzed or not fizzed. Each of these films bears the Cannes brand or kitemark \u2014&nbsp;which is perhaps a good deal for each contender, as it is usually only the final award-winners which end up associated with the festival. This is a bold, even defiant statement of survival from Cannes, a festival which refused to countenance the idea of putting its films online (the concept now being considered by Toronto) or delaying until the autumn, which would have meant the unthinkable diplomatic faux pas of colliding with Venice. Rather than do that, Cannes has decided on staying put on the biggest screen of all: the screen of our wistful imagination.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s trickier to detect trends.&nbsp;Of the 56 films here, 16 are directed by women, two more than in 2019, but not a great advance \u2013&nbsp;not compared to, say, Toronto, which is more strenuously committed to the ideal of gender parity. And it&nbsp;looks very much as if Cannes 2020 would not have been a very Hollywood-y festival, as the studios may well have been chary of committing themselves to a festival that wouldn\u2019t happen. However, Wes Anderson\u2019s The French Dispatch (with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Elisabeth Moss) and was due to play, probably as the opening gala, and Pete Docter\u2019s hugely anticipated Pixar animation Soul, about a jazz musician voiced by Jamie Foxx who has lost his musical passion and is transported out of his body. Viggo Mortensen makes his directorial debut with Falling, the story of a conservative father coming to terms with his gay son\u2019s family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae6c08dcfe4caa27296c4b4a5f0fda7c12f824b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae6c08dcfe4caa27296c4b4a5f0fda7c12f824b3/568_323_5073_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ket Winslet and Saoirse Ronan in Ammonite.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ket Winslet and Saoirse Ronan in Ammonite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It looked like being a big year for the British. Steve McQueen, who achieved his sensational breakthrough at Cannes in 2008 with Hunger, about the IRA hunger strikes, has two items on the Cannes 2020 fantasy-virtual list. Mangrove and Lovers Rock are both feature-length films from Small Axe, a TV anthology about the West Indian community of London in the 70s and 80s; this may have been due to screen as a double-part special, like Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s Too Old To Die Young drama in 2019.</p> <p>Francis Lee, who achieved a tremendous success with God\u2019s Own Country, now tackles comparable LGBT issues with Ammonite, a 19th century period drama with Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan. First-time British feature director Ben Sharrock gets a Cannes 2020 listing for his Limbo, a drama about refugees waiting to be granted asylum on a Scottish island.</p> <p>There is also, incidentally, great British interest in the Studio Ghibli movie which is included: Aya And The Witch, from director Goro Miyazaki, son of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki (who in fact initiated the project). It is based on the novel Earwig and the Witch, by the British author Diana Wynne Jones (who wrote Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, the source for another iconic Ghibli gem). This is another example of how Ghibli is deeply involved in classic English children\u2019s literature.</p> <p>Cannes 2020 is also set to be a very French festival, with many French film-makers pm the list, most prominently the veteran Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, with his Summer of 85, a memory of tense teen years.</p> <p>It\u2019s so sad not to have a proper Cannes this year, and it will take an effort of will to remember for each film that it had the Cannes 2020 stamp when it comes out \u2014&nbsp;and who knows how many of these films will simply disappear into the mists of non-release. It\u2019s difficult to avoid a sense of anticlimax. But we salute the determination, and look ahead to Cannes 2021 with even greater yearning.</p>",

He also implied that scientists are sceptical about the policy generally. Asked if Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, had endorsed this timetable, he said dates and policy were a matter for ministers. He also said quarantine works best when the infection rate is low in the country receiving visitors and high in those countries sending them in. This is not the case with the UK at the moment vis-\u00e0-vis arrivals from most EU countries.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said it would take \u201cquite some time\u201d before the new test and trace system was working at full capacity.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new thing that has been brought in - and it is definitely, as you imply, in the early stages of its development, but it is definitely there, and definitely working, but it will work a lot better over time - is the new element of test and trace ...</p> <p>We are not yet at cruising altitude for this. The number of tests is going to keep on going up and our ability to use the tests we have got is going to carry on going up. This is going to carry on for quite some time before we get to the point where we are all satisfied we have got to the point we need.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson ducked a question about whether Britons would be able to take a foreign holiday this summer.</strong> Asked if it was safe to book one, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not going to give advice on individuals\u2019 travel arrangements, but you know what the Foreign Office guidance is... everybody at the moment should avoid non-essential travel.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed he was a Sinophile.</strong> Asked about Huawei and whether he would now exclude it from the 5G network, he said he wanted solutions that worked for UK security. But he went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to stress one thing. I am a Sinophile. I think China is an incredible country and an extraordinary civilisation.</p> <p>And I deeply disapprove of anti-Chinese xenophobia - attacks on people of Chinese appearance that we have seen in recent months.

Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything much has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a#block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a\">here</a>, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that from Johnson at PMQs later, when he pledged to ensure all test results are turned around with 24 hours by the end of the month (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news?page=with:block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7#block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7\"> 12.19pm </a>\u2013 there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing later) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government.

And it suggests that 21% of people say they are following lockdown rules less strictly than before - with a third of those saying that\u2019s at least partly because of Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>Here is the chart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668/0_0_1868_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling on lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling on lockdown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As <strong>Chris Curtis</strong> explains in <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2020/06/03/one-five-have-started-breaking-lockdown-rules-more\">a commentary for the YouGov website</a>, Cummings\u2019 excursion to Barnard Castle is not the only factor that might explain why people are taking the lockdown rules less seriously. Curtis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those advising the government had always suggested that people would become less observant of the rules as time goes on, which was one of the reasons for delaying lockdown in the first place.</p> <p>We have also seen an increase in the proportion of the public who think the situation is getting better, from 58% to 76% in two weeks, which might also be making some less cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another factor might be ambiguity in the wording. The polling was carried out on Thursday last week and, when people were asked what they had done in the past week, 21% said they had followed the lockdown rules less strictly than previously. When the same question was asked at the end of April, only 5% gave that answer. But by Thursday last week the lockdown rules were less strict than they had been anyway and so some of those 21% may just be people transitioning from obeying the old rules to the new ones.</p> <p>Still, any evidence that people are taking socially distancing less seriously should be worrying. The documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies repeatedly stress that easing the lockdown is only safe if people continue to comply with restrictions like the two-metre rule. For example, this is what\u2019s Sage\u2019s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (SPI-M-O) said in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888759/S0313_SAGE33_Consensus_for_SPI-M_on_transition_strategies.pdf\">a consensus view (pdf)</a> dated 4 May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below 1.

Bad//Dreems recorded their first two records with Mark Opitz, who produced classics by Cold Chisel, INXS and AC/DC, and while his fingerprints seem to mark this new release, the song was in fact put down live in a dive studio in Hackney during a UK tour. Whatever the recording location, there\u2019s no mistaking the sunburnt sound throughout, with sonic nods towards the Scientists, Radio Birdman, the Saints, and other early Australian punk, in both the dishevelled delivery and ragged-yet-tight musicianship.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Check out their third album Doomsday Ballet, released last October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/03/jack-colwell-swandream-review-\">Jack Colwell: Swandream review \u2013 theatrical, raw songs packed with pain and soaring survival</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Sia \u2013 Together</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Motown</p> <p>Sia Furler has spent the past few years lending her quirky speaking voice to animated films such as My Little Pony and Peter Rabbit, which goes some way to explaining her slowed-down music schedule of late. The Adelaide artist hasn\u2019t been otherwise idle: she has simply been shooting her feature directorial debut, Music, which stars Kate Hudson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/sia-ethics-of-fame-and-maddie-ziegler-a-question-i-have-asked-myself-often\">Furler\u2019s proxy Maddie Ziegler</a>, and promises 10 new Sia songs to boot. Together is the first taste of this coming windfall; a bright and inspirational pop tune that speaks of rainbows, angels, and Stevie Wonder in the lyrics, quotes the Lion King for kicks, and finds Sia leading a choir of children, Pied Piper style, through a schoolyard chant of a chorus. The song was co-written by Jack Antonoff, whose recent work with Lana Del Rey, Lorde and Taylor Swift has made him the most sought-after collaborator in pop; it\u2019s no surprise he and Furler have an easy chemistry here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ae49ae9ef768d698f3a06754237e378f502762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ae49ae9ef768d698f3a06754237e378f502762/0_209_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sia Furler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sia Furler and Maddie Ziegler.

This is most successfully realised on the band\u2019s 2011 classic Zonoscope, a psychotropic record with a 60s sound, sharpened with 80s technology, and mastered for an iPod. Whereas Cut Copy\u2019s most popular songs seem to turn on a dime, arrangement-wise, Love Is All We Share laconically lingers for a luxurious six minutes, beds of analogue keys hugging half-asleep vocals imploring us to pay attention to our universal similarities rather than focus on our differences \u2013 a song for the times if ever there was one. Cut Copy have been sitting on this track for a year, but given the current climate, it seems like the breath of air we deserve right now.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Cut Copy\u2019s sixth album will be out sometime in 2020.</p> <h2>Washington \u2013 Dark Parts</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Kylie Minogue, the Cardigans, the Dissociatives</p> <p>With each release, Washington has strayed further into glossy pop territory, discarding her piano-led indie songs for lush production pieces that favour dark synths, frenetic rhythms, and shifting song structures. Dark Parts is a strong statement of intent: a disorienting time signature at odds with dancefloors, computer-warped harmonies that sound like a robotic Tony Robbins, keys that drunkenly wobble and sway. There\u2019s no discerning hook for a while, relying instead on a rhythmic and hypnotic vocal to hammer its way into your skull. Then a rush of 80s synths flutter in, and Washington unleashes an earworm chorus that is up there with her very finest moments. By the beautifully shimmering bridge breakdown you\u2019ll be spellbound, your finger hovering above the \u201crepeat\u201d button, your brain needing to hear more.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out the video for the song, hand-drawn and animated by Megan Washington.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPa8jK39yj0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OPa8jK39yj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Tkay Maidza \u2013 Shook</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Nicki Minaj, Lil Kim, Timbaland</p> <p>Tkay Maidza\u2019s 2016 debut album was one of the best Australian releases of the decade, the perfect calling card for this insanely gifted artist. This slickly produced set was followed by an eight-song EP that upped the hip-hop quotient, and a handful of singles that pushed her further in this direction. Shook is another belting hip-hop track and another assured victory: a minimal beat indebted to Timbaland\u2019s barely-there productions of the turn of the century, with Maidza delivering bars and bars of dexterous, effortless rap. It\u2019s her first single since signing to legendary UK label 4AD, home to Grimes, Pixies and Purity Ring, and acts as an apt introduction to her pure hip-hop skills, if not her excellent singing voice and ear for a hook. The bonkers outro is an incredible left-turn, reminiscent of Kanye West\u2019s bolted-on song endings, and a nice harbinger of further experiments in sound.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out her 2019 singles: Awake and I DC IF U BE DED</p> <h2>Sweet Whirl \u2013 Closing Time</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Carole King, Holly Throsby, Sean Lennon</p> <p>Upon hearing Melbourne songwriter Sweet Whirl aka Esther Edquist\u2019s exquisite debut album, it becomes obvious why her first few recordings came as lo-fi cassettes. This is deeply personal music, perfect when housed in such an intimate artefact as a tape \u2013 designed to be carried in pockets, studied in solitude, worn out through repeated listens, warped by the weather. \u201cI\u2019ve drank too much from the lives of others / Their sorrows have grown stale / Cluttering the table,\u201d she sings of taking on third party pains. It\u2019s a sentiment not often shared in song. Edquis attempts to emotionally distance herself from the song\u2019s subject, despite the very intimacy of the song itself. A stark, plodding keyboard provides the only musical accompaniment \u2013 a ghost chanting softly as Edquist gently explains why she is leaving.</p> <p><strong>For More: </strong>How Much Works is out now.</p> <h2>Ice Cream Hands \u2013 No Weapon but Love</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Crowded House, Teenage Fanclub, Paul Kelly</p> <p>For power pop fans across the world, Ice Cream Hands were a criminally underrated band, deserving of the type of transatlantic success their luckier peers found in inner-Melbourne pubs during the 90s. Thirteen years since what was touted as a comeback record, 2007\u2019s The Good China, Ice Cream Hands return with this sparkling anthem to love and life. And, thankfully, they don\u2019t try to reinvent the Rickenbacker with this tune, instead offering up the type of timeless pop they have always trafficked in: dreamy harmonies pulled from the Beatles playbook, jangling guitars that summon summers past, and a simple message of love which will never slide out of style. To quote their 1999 high point, this sound is sweeter than the radio.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Ice Cream Hands\u2019 sixth album will be out in late 2020.</p> <h2>Pure Milk \u2013 Pressure</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Lucksmiths, Bright Eyes, Darren Hanlon</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a167910f77288d783e922b4bb4bd5a2b1cb83c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a167910f77288d783e922b4bb4bd5a2b1cb83c90/0_270_1080_1350/800.jpg\" alt=\"Australian band Pure Milk\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pure Milk: sadness has never sounded this spritely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a laconic country twang to this tune that is quite at odds to the restless anxiety of the lyrics. Gold Coast five-piece Pure Milk make music indebted to Dylan\u2019s lighter records, to Silver Jews and the Saddle Creek roster, and like the aforementioned music, this song lives or dies on its lyrics. \u201cNo signs of life / Only remnants of living / How did I end up in this place?\u201d sings Lewis Nitschinsk, and things don\u2019t get any brighter as he reels through a laundry list of woes, from days that linger forever, to the ghost of a past lover that haunts him. Words like \u201crestless\u201d, \u201cbored\u201d, \u201cawkward\u201d and \u201canxiety\u201d punctuate the malaise. At one point he lists attributes as if to convince himself of their worth. Sadness has never sounded this spritely.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out their EP Self Improvement and recent single Conversations.</p> <h2>Pearl the Girl \u2013 Long Way Back</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>M83, the Preatures, the Grates</p> <p>This is music to drive down the coast to, windows down, a hurricane whipping your hair into your eyes as the song\u2019s giddy momentum seemingly propels the car. With a relentless rhythm and joyous guitar lines chiming throughout, Long Way Back finds the Sydney songwriter building upon triple j fave Single Use Plastic with another hook-crammed jam that never takes its foot off the pedal. Pearl expertly uses space during the verses to suck the air out of the arrangement, a plodding bass and the slight grit of her vocals marking time, until a rush of stabbing one-note guitar parts, and chunky open chords push the chorus into the stratosphere. This is an exciting rock song.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Pearl the Girl\u2019s new EP is released 16 June. Until then, check out her debut album Just a Phase.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/sydney-opera-houses-livestreamed-concert-series-could-be-a-game-changer-for-local-bands\">Sydney Opera House's livestreamed concert series could be a game-changer for local bands</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Glenn Richards \u2013 Hi Gene!&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>80s Bowie, Talking Heads, Lou Reed</p> <p>As songwriter and singer of Melbourne\u2019s Augie March, Glenn Richards has put six excellent albums out into the world, including the stately Sunset Studies, currently celebrating its 20th anniversary. He even wrote a bonafide hit with 2006\u2019s crashing waltz One Crowded Hour, voted both APRA Song of the Year and No 1 song in triple j\u2019s Hottest 100, so it\u2019s surprising that until now, Richards hadn\u2019t released a solo single. Hi Gene! certainly makes a statement. Those expecting the haunted timbre of Augie March will instead be greeted by high-pitched voices spelling out the song title as if from an evil edition of Sesame Street. \u201cI like my music clean,\u201d he chants as if hypnotised by the march of modernity that has led us to polishing all the edges of our art. \u201cI like my body smooth / I like my genitals shaved\u201d, he adds one verse later, over a repeating music box melody. This is a darkly comedic treatise about the times; well-drawn and ultimately a little mean. It\u2019s also the first gambit of what will hopefully prove to be an odd, challenging solo career.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Glenn Richards will release a solo album this year, and Augie March are in the process of rescheduling their Sunset Studies anniversary tour.</p>",

  "<p>This year, Tiger King, the seven-part docu-series following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/insane-intoxicating-tale-of-big-cats-is-perfect-lockdown-tv-tiger-watch-james-mcavoy-greta-gerwig\">number of eccentric big-cat owners</a>, breeders and conservationists in the US, was named <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/tv/tiger-king-netflix-record-stream-2642603\">Netflix\u2019s most-watched title</a>. So it\u2019s hardly surprising that one of the show\u2019s favourites, John Reinke, the former GW zoo manager known for his straight-talking and his tattooed prosthetic legs, has said he is \u201cirritated\u201d that he hasn\u2019t made a penny from it.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI filmed that thing for five or six years, and didn\u2019t make biscuits out of that,\u201d Reinke said in an interview with <a href=\"https://toofab.com/2020/05/13/john-reinke-no-money-from-tiger-king-or-from-losing-his-legs/\">the pop culture website TooFab</a>. \u201cNetflix made all the money on that.\u201d</p> <p>If Reinke or any of the other cast members had been paid it would undoubtedly have undermined the film-maker\u2019s credibility. That was the problem encountered by the makers of Hulu\u2019s Fyre festival doc, Fyre Fraud, which was initially praised as more trustworthy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/16/fyre-festival-documentaries-hulu-netflix\">than a competing documentary on Netflix</a> (produced by Jerry Media, the firm responsible for advertising the festival). This trust evaporated when it was revealed that the show\u2019s central villain, Billy McFarland, was paid <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fyre-festival-organizer-paid-for-exclusive-hulu-interview-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T#:~:text=Billy%20McFarland%2C%20the%20festival%20organizer,was%20as%20much%20as%20%24250%2C000.\">for his involvement</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tiger King serves as an example of the increasingly blurred lines between documentary, factual entertainment and reality TV, and so lends itself to the ongoing question of why reality TV stars so often go unpaid. Payment by way of exposure has been decried as problematic in every other industry, from journalism to fashion, but reality TV appears to be the one realm where it is considered valid to offer compensation via the tentative promise of C-list celebrity status. It is an increasingly precarious agreement, given that the good old days of selling exclusive, staged images to the tabloids are long gone. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/09/jade-goody-scorned-celebrity-big-brother-britain-class-prejudice\">Jade Goody made good money</a> from slinging her own \u201ccandid\u201d snaps to the press, that hustle doesn\u2019t cut it in the Instagram era, where pictures are simply ripped by papers straight from the feed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The rules vary programme to programme. In many cases, reality stars are not considered employees of their shows\u2019 production companies, so just receive expenses. Those that appear in competition-type series such as Survivor or The Bachelor often receive no form of remuneration at all. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/reality-tv-stars-paid-salary\">contestants auditioning for The Bachelor</a> must sign a contract beforehand stating that \u201cthey will not make claims against the producer for compensation, derived from any allegation of status as an employee\u201d. They must agree to appear as \u201cparticipants\u201d in a contest, as opposed to \u201cperformers\u201d; the former not being recognised legally as a form of employee. This is similar in programmes such as Married at First Sight and <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a31102409/love-is-blind-netflix-weddings/\">Love Is Blind</a>, where the official gain is said not to be monetary, but in finding true love (and, unofficially, a new social media audience).&nbsp;</p> <p>The potential financial gains are huge, but by no means guaranteed. Many contestants quit their jobs to go on The Apprentice or rack up huge bills attempting to get on The Bachelor. It\u2019s a risky strategy with no financial safety net; a regular complaint of contestants who are eventually cast but don\u2019t make the big time is that they struggle to find work afterwards. They are suspended in a strange limbo, with a level of fame that is enough to alienate potential employers but not sufficient to garner a steady income as a celebrity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Much like the influencer culture with which reality TV is so associated, the customs that govern how and whether the stars are paid is vague \u2013 is it about visibility, fame, payment in kind? And it\u2019s undoubtedly a class issue, too. These shows are usually dominated by working-class people who, if they are lucky, go on to become household names. Those who are already well-off are usually better protected. Though it is not confirmed, it is estimated that stars of <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/which-real-housewives-star-gets-paid-the-most-in-the-entire-franchise.html/\">The Real Housewives and Vanderpump Rules</a> franchises earn up to $2.75m (\u00a32.2m) a season. The Kardashians, meanwhile, reportedly make about <a href=\"https://heavy.com/money/2019/08/khloe-kardashian-net-worth-2019/#:~:text=The%20Stars%20of%20KUWTK%20Make%20an%20Estimated%20%24900%2C000%20Per%20Episode&amp;text=The%20family%20reportedly%20publicly%20agreed,family%20is%20making%20%24150%20million.\">$900,000 an episode</a>. Aspiration and elitism are integral to such shows, so even if they don\u2019t come out of it as a fan favourite, they will be fine and are unlikely to be trapped by contracts with as little protection as, say, bachelorettes, the contestants eliminated from The Bachelor.</p> <p>One good run on a show can be life-changing; just look at the various Love Island millionaires or the drag queens on Drag Race that have gone on to build fempires. Social media and celebrity endorsement means the majority of success stories make their money away from the show; at one point, a strip in Brentwood, Essex, was dominated by shops owned by the cast of The Only Way Is Essex. Despite members of the show frequently topping reality-TV rich lists, however, not all the participants get their due. The original Towie cast was allegedly paid a measly <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3425304/towie-cast-salaries-the-only-way-is-essex-paid/\">\u00a350 an episode</a> and, just last year, half the cast boycotted <a href=\"https://employeebenefits.co.uk/towie-boycott-itv-party-pay-dispute/\">ITV\u2019s summer party</a> protesting about their \u00a3100-a-day pay. A number of the cast\u2019s shops, which once attracted their own tourism boom, have now closed.</p> <p>This issue is exacerbated on the show <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a27628849/do-90-day-fiance-couples-get-paid/#:~:text=Do%2090%20Day%20Fianc%C3%A9%20couples,for%20a%2012%2Depisode%20season.\">90 Day Fianc\u00e9</a>, in which US citizens and their foreign fiances are followed for the 90 days their K1 visa allows them to decide whether to get married. The show\u2019s US citizens receive about $1,500 an episode, but since the visa does not give applicants enough time to obtain a work permit, their non-citizen counterparts do not. Given the fact that it is usually the non-American partner\u2019s character arc that garners the views, goes viral and pushes the thrust of the storylines, that doesn\u2019t feel fair. It feels exploitative, especially in a situation where many of them live in fear of deportation. The series isn\u2019t necessarily aired in their home countries, meaning they are unable to capitalise on their newfound, financially lucrative fame in the same way as their US peers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though not a reality-TV show cast member, Reinke\u2019s disappointment at not monetising his appearance on Tiger King is understandable. \u201cI\u2019ve not tried to make money at all through this \u2026 until now,\u201d he said. The ethical issues with paying documentary contributors are certainly valid. But one does wonder, given all that the standout characters on reality TV do to make the shows what they are, how many grand performances they will have to put on before producers make their appearances worth their while.&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/china-accuses-uk-of-gross-interference-over-hong-kong-citizenship-offer\">Boris Johnson\u2019s promise</a> to give millions of Hong Kong citizens a path to UK citizenship is a remarkable offer from a government that has spent four years wrestling with Brexit so as to end the free movement of people from Europe. </p> <p>For one door to be slammed shut only for another to be opened so wide is striking, especially since the policy\u2019s popularity among the Conservative membership or pro-Brexit voters has yet to be tested. Recent polling by the Cabinet Office unearthed widespread ignorance about China.</p> <p>The argument in government circles is that Brexit was never about halting migration, but about sovereignty and the right for the UK to control its own migration policy, including by selecting those with the skills most needed in the UK.</p> <p>It can be argued that the quartet at the top of the Tories are the archetypal beneficiaries of migration. The family of the home secretary, Priti Patel, fled Uganda. The father of the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, came to the UK from Czechoslovakia aged six in 1938, following the Munich agreement, which gave parts of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany. The grandparents of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, arrived in the 60s from east Africa. Even the prime minister, Boris Johnson, a product of Eton and Oxford, has both Turkish and American ancestors. They are not quite citizens of nowhere, the phrase used insultingly by Theresa May, the former prime minister, but all four have backgrounds that make them alive to the benefits of political asylum.</p> <p>There is also a streak of guilt that runs through the Conservative party about its treatment of Hong Kong citizens, and an admission that, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, the great cold warrior, it placed the people of Hong Kong into the hands of the Chinese Communist party in 1994.</p> <p>After the handover, Hong Kong citizens ended up with a jerry-built halfway house. They could hold a British national overseas passport, providing them consular assistance and protection through UK diplomatic posts, but they would not have the automatic right to live or work in the UK. Those born after 1997 would have no rights.</p> <p>In his memoirs, the last governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, wrote: \u201cEven in the 1990s many Conservatives and much of the British media resisted any idea we should be moderately generous in the award of citizenship to some of those who lived in Hong Kong (often serving directly the colonial power) and deserved a guarantee if necessary they could look to Britain for a home after 1997. <em>Civis Romanus </em><em>sum</em> was not to be translated into a modern British obligation. Australia, Canada, both of course Commonwealth countries, were much more generous over the granting of citizenship to Hong Kong residents. They were a lot more maternal than the so-called \u2018mother country\u2019.</p> <p>Thatcher took some political flak at the time. In 1989, Paddy Ashdown, the Mandarin-speaking leader of the newly merged Social and Liberal Democrats, defined his new party in the wake of Tiananmen Square by campaigning for Hong Kong citizens to be given the right of abode. </p> <p>So how has Ashdown\u2019s liberal view become the political consensus? There were, after all, influential migrants at the top of the May and David Cameron governments. Cameron, a Sinophile, confined himself to urging China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on a state visit to the UK in 2015 to allowing Hongkongers to choose their own leader without Beijing\u2019s prior vetting.</p> <p>Cameron had seen what had happened to Angela Merkel when she opened the door to Syrian refugees in 2015, and was not going there with Hong Kong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42908e3bd72685f128da63269d1d0b1fbeb3d5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42908e3bd72685f128da63269d1d0b1fbeb3d5c8/0_91_2984_1790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron and Xi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron drinking with Xi Jinping at a pub near Chequers during the 2015 state visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, individual cabinet members have played their part in the change of mind, but bigger trends forced Johnson into a choice. With protests growing ever more violent in Hong Kong and elections producing pro-democracy legislatures, the possibility that China would wreak revenge and end the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement had to be countenanced. A cross-government contingency planning group was set up in September.</p> <p>The contingency group was formed amid a broader rethink in the Conservative party about China. By last summer an influential group of Tory MPs, including Iain Duncan Smith, Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, came to the conclusion that the rise of China under Xi was a threat to the west and needed to be resisted. Global Britain, a foggy concept for many years, came to be defined as a commitment to openness, democracy and a rules-based order. Hong Kong serendipitously became the rallying point for this foreign policy. China\u2019s handling of coronavirus, and the controversy over Huawei, has further embedded this process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/it-is-much-worse-veterans-of-hong-kongs-2003-protests-fear-new-china-law\">'It is much worse': veterans of Hong Kong's 2003 protests fear new law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK has few levers apart from moral persuasion with which to deter Beijing from pressing ahead with the security laws.

  "<p>Despite its imperial name, caesar salad was created in 1920s Mexico to feed the hordes of thirsty Americans forced across the border by prohibition. Wanting to relieve the pressure on his kitchen, restaurateur <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_Cardini\">Caesar Cardini</a> came up with a recipe simple enough to be prepared by his waiters instead.

Peel and crush the garlic, either using a press or in a mortar, then mix with the oil and leave to mingle, ideally for an hour or so. If you\u2019re keen to eat immediately, you can bypass this stage, but it gives the finished dish a more mellow flavour, so do make time for it, if you can.</p> <h2>2 Prepare the croutons</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40443d34fb7429fa0a94f4d54f65a6a5ab5737b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40443d34fb7429fa0a94f4d54f65a6a5ab5737b6/0_410_6631_5134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chunks of bread on a chopping board\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At least 20 minutes before you want to eat, heat the oven and a large baking sheet to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Cut the bread into rough, crouton-sized cubes (I like to keep mine quite large). You can use just about any bread you want here, but something fairly robust such as a sourdough will give the crunchiest results.</p> <h2>3 Bake the croutons</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13935161defd495c9263a60b40b7b815724b91cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13935161defd495c9263a60b40b7b815724b91cd/0_64_8200_5931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toasted bread pieces for caesar salad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Toss the bread cubes in a little of the oil \u2013 just enough to coat them, rather than soak them completely \u2013 and a pinch of salt (bear in mind that the dressing will be quite salty anyway, thanks to the anchovies), then scatter them over the hot baking sheet, spreading them out well. Bake for about 15 minutes, until golden and crisp.</p> <h2>4 Mash the anchovies</h2> <p>Meanwhile, rinse the anchovy fillets if they\u2019re packed in salt (there\u2019s no need to do this for those in oil), then use a fork to mash them to a smooth paste in the bottom of a large salad bowl; if it\u2019s easier, you can do this in a mortar, but scoop them into the serving bowl before moving on to the next step.</p> <h2>5 Add the egg yolk, garlic oil and lemon</h2> <p>Beat in the egg yolk until well combined, then gradually whisk in the remaining garlic oil until you have a thickish dressing, rather like a thin mayonnaise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f44a08006093e44585dd3036ef967e89715b4f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f44a08006093e44585dd3036ef967e89715b4f1/0_291_8089_5501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dressing for a caesar salad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Finally, whisk in the lemon juice and taste: season with plenty of roughly ground black pepper and a little salt, if necessary.</p> <h2>6 Prepare the lettuce</h2> <p>Split the lettuces into individual leaves, then wash and dry well in clean tea towels \u2013 the dressing will just run off wet leaves, so it\u2019s important not to skip this step. Originally, caesar salad was finger food for drinkers and the leaves were left whole, but if you intend to eat yours with a knife and fork, tear the leaves into rough pieces.</p> <h2>7 Dress the lettuce and add cheese</h2> <p>Add the lettuce to the salad bowl and toss to coat in the dressing (I use my hands, but if you\u2019re vigorous enough, two big spoons or some tongs will also do the job).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc0591dd2dd223e3df8cf77adcb30f63859f0b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc0591dd2dd223e3df8cf77adcb30f63859f0b3f/0_800_10314_6188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The base for a caesar salad before the addition of chicken, fish or eggs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Add the grated cheese and toss again, then scatter over the croutons and serve at once, before the bread has time to go soggy.</p> <h2>8 Bulk up with chicken \u2026</h2> <p>Chargrilled chicken is often added to turn this salad into a more substantial dish. Bash two chicken breasts out until fairly flat, then rub with olive oil and season. Heat a griddle pan or greased frying pan until sizzling hot, then fry the chicken for about four minutes on each side, until cooked through. Slice and add to the salad at the same time as the croutons.</p> <h2>9 \u2026 or fish or eggs</h2> <p>Chargrilled salmon or white fish also works well in a caesar salad, and large prawns are popular in the States, but my favourite topping is warm boiled eggs. Cooked in simmering water for eight minutes and cooled under cold running water, then peeled and quartered, they turn this into a very punchy egg mayonnaise salad.</p>",
  "<p>Four men have won the sprint triple of 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the Olympics and, chances are, you know three of them: Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt. Then there is Bobby Joe Morrow, who died last weekend at the age of 84. When Morrow won all three at the Melbourne Games in 1956 he was, briefly, as famous as any of the others. He was a guest on the Ed Sullivan show, same episode as Marcel Marceau, and Arthur Godfrey and His Friends, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x0EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">he made the cover of Life magazine</a> and was even named by the US Chamber of Commerce as one of nine Great Living Americans, right alongside Cecil B DeMille and Norman Rockwell.</p> <p>Sports Illustrated made him <a href=\"https://vault.si.com/vault/1957/01/07/sportsman-of-1956\" title=\"\">its sportsman of 1956</a>, the same year Floyd Patterson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history and Mickey Mantle won the triple crown for the Yankees. Morrow was 21 years old, tall, handsome, and \u201cthe Beau Ideal of the US Olympic team\u201d. He grew up on a farm in San Benito, way down in south-east Texas, his father was an elder in the Church of Christ, and the family were \u201cprosperous, unostentatious, and deeply religious\u201d. The way they told it, his only vice was ice cream. It made him something \u201ca little larger than a fine sprinter\u201d. He was the \u201csort of American which most of the world has had too little opportunity to know\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/my-favourite-game-britain-upset-usa-gold-tokyo-91\">My favourite game: Britain upset the USA with 4x400m gold at Tokyo '91 | Stuart Goodwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almost 50 years later, Sports Illustrated travelled back to San Benito to profile Morrow again.

Reading all this back now, alongside the few scant paragraphs that have been published in the papers since his death, it feels like Bobby Morrow\u2019s wasn\u2019t a story about the rewards of fame but the costs. But then he would likely scoff at that, just as he seemed to at almost everything else that was written about him.</p> <p>He could always run. In his last year of high school he covered 100 yards in 9.6sec, hand-timed. He was something to see, in those days. \u201cHe was the most beautiful runner anyone ever saw,\u201d said his first wife, Jo Ann Richey. \u201cSo relaxed, so graceful, like when he was chasing rabbits back on the farm.\u201d Morrow\u2019s coach at Abilene Christian University reckoned he \u201ccould run a 220 with a root beer float on his head and never spill a drop\u201d.

In Melbourne he became the first man since Owens to win three gold medals in the sprints, set an Olympic record in the 200m and anchored the 4x100m team to a world record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1996fa0010d6e3d45caaef9aeaa3fff213add1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1996fa0010d6e3d45caaef9aeaa3fff213add1b/22_343_2915_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thane Baker (centre) hands the baton to Bobby Joe Morrow in the first heat of the 4x100 in Melbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thane Baker (centre) hands the baton to Bobby Joe Morrow in the first heat of the 4x100 in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SF/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morrow intended to defend his Olympic titles at Rome in 1960, when he was 25. But he strained a muscle before the trials and, running injured, finished last in his 100m heat. Still, the head coach invited him along to the team\u2019s training camp and told him that if his leg got better they would find a space for him on the relay team. It did, but they didn\u2019t. The day before the team were due to fly to Rome they said they still hadn\u2019t made a decision, and that he should come along to the airport the next morning. When he did, they finally told him he wasn\u2019t going. Richey said the humiliation he felt was a cause of their divorce years later.</p> <p>They had twins, and Morrow, who had quit a bank job so he could train full-time, found he was struggling to support them. He had railed against the Amateur Athletics Union\u2019s strict rules limiting earnings, and the hypocrisy of the men who enforced them, like the International Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage. He saw how the officials \u2013 \u201ca bunch of guys whose job was to hand out soap and towels, because they had to find something for them to do\u201d \u2013 enjoyed first-class flights and accommodation while the athletes were living on $15 per diem. </p> <p>Morrow met the US attorney general Robert Kennedy to petition him about it, and then testified at a senate hearing on the subject. Nothing changed, except that he got even angrier about the way he had been treated.</p> <p>So Morrow started looking for other ways to make money. A conman named Max Nunn roped him into a snake oil business selling a \u201cmineral potion\u201d called Stim-o-Stam. \u201cAll the friends I sold stock to lost their money,\u201d he told William Martin, \u201cpeople that didn\u2019t really have money, that had to go out and borrow it to put it in.\u201d He fell in with the infamous Church of Christ fraudster Billie Sol Estes, too. Then he was caught up in a third scandal when he was recruited by a phoney organisation called the Higher Education Crusade.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, somebody was using my name to do their dirty work,\u201d he told Martin. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any control over it but, of course, my name was connected with the company as representing them. I felt lousy, really. I seemed to be always getting involved with crooks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c422d9339da82c508937834629fcfd4ef2e714d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c422d9339da82c508937834629fcfd4ef2e714d5/37_137_1912_1148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Joe Morrow (left) is handed an Olympic portrait of himself during the 2006 inauguration of the stadium that bears his name in San Benito, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Joe Morrow (left) is handed an Olympic portrait of himself during the 2006 inauguration of the stadium that bears his name in San Benito, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynn Hermosa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So he started to shun publicity, to skip the reunions, and forgo the public appearances. By the time he spoke to Martin, Morrow had remarried, and was living back on his family farm. Still, he said he was sorry he had ever won the medals, that he would have been happier if he\u2019d been \u201cjust another man in the street\u201d. He was inducted into the National Track &amp; Field hall of fame in 1989, and San Benito high school named its football stadium after him in 2006.</p> <p>You like to think that, in the end, he found a measure of happiness in his obscurity \u2013 but perhaps that, too, is just a bit of wishful thinking, another of the stories we tell ourselves about our heroes.</p>",

Renewables marginally edged out coal, while nuclear stood at 8%.</p> <p>\u201cGetting past coal is a big first hurdle but the next round will be the gas industry,\u201d said Wamsted. \u201cThere are emissions from gas plants and they are significant. It\u2019s certainly not over.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In less than three months, the coronavirus has upended America\u2019s public education system.</p> <p>The virus triggered closures of unprecedented scale and forced educators across the country to quickly transition to online teaching, many for the first time in their careers.</p> <p>Roughly 11 weeks since the start of the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-coronavirus-and-school-closures.html\">124,000 US schools</a> remain closed for in-person instruction as they limp toward summer break, affecting almost 51 million students.&nbsp;</p> <p>The coronavirus is quickly becoming the defining moment in education for a generation of schoolchildren and their parents.&nbsp;</p> <p>But what of the teachers? How are they managing this new reality? The Guardian checked in with four California educators \u2026</p> <h2>\u2018It feels like The Twilight Zone\u2019</h2> <p>Just as closures have affected the nature of work, they have changed the complexion of teachers\u2019 home lives.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day looks absolutely wild. I was not prepared to spend 24 hours a day with my children,\u201d said Shelly Steely, who teaches at an <a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/37683383730231/2019#suspension-rate-card\">alternative high school</a> in San Diego geared toward students who are at risk of dropping out. </p> <p>Since the lockdowns started, she has struggled to keep pace.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMy husband is working at a call center, so it\u2019s really tough to have time for all the work plus caring for my own kids, cooking and cleaning and helping them with their homework. And we lost our babysitter because my dad is high-risk and hasn\u2019t been able to do it,\u201d Steely said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf5dc38fa82d31bed8658888036ac43e89f2c96c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf5dc38fa82d31bed8658888036ac43e89f2c96c/0_0_5360_3574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching in saner times.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teaching in saner times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tina Alcatraz Andres, a middle school teacher in<a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/30666700000000/2019\"> Santa Ana Unified</a>, just south of Los Angeles, said she has been working disjointed, 15-hour days as a parent to two children, 14 and 15. Layered upon those stressors, Andres\u2019s father was diagnosed with Covid-19 days after schools closed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have times where all four of us are on Zoom calls,\u201d Andres said of her working husband, also a teacher, and her kids. \u201cAnd sometimes the internet goes down and it\u2019s panic mode.\u201d</p> <p>Andres has also noticed the lockdown has shifted her family and students\u2019 schedules. Everybody seems to be waking up later now.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t really plan anything early in the morning, because kids don\u2019t show up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing most of my grading at night, around 10 o\u2019clock. Sometimes I send a paper back and I\u2019m talking to students after 1am about the work. It\u2019s very weird and adds to the Twilight Zone feeling of this whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>Andres notes one unexpected perk of the new normal, however. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gotten to know some of my students better. Some who have been quiet seem to have come alive.\u201d</p> <h2>Digital disconnect</h2> <p>In the weeks that followed the first school closures, teachers describe frantic scenes of hustling to get laptops and hotspots into students\u2019 hands or cobbling together distance learning plans, often from scratch. Stories of teachers scrambling to connect with awol students abounded.&nbsp;</p> <p>At Los Angeles Unified, the nation\u2019s second-largest school district, roughly <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-los-angeles-schools-15000-high-school-students-absent\">15,000 high school students</a> were absent online and completed no school work in the transition to distance learning.&nbsp;</p> <p>In San Diego, trying to engage students online has been Steely\u2019s biggest stress point.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"724010918e3fccab49f6926333a1dc70bd74d52e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/724010918e3fccab49f6926333a1dc70bd74d52e/0_0_5000_3417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Security guards talk on the campus of the closed McKinley School, part of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) system, in Compton, California, just south of Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Security guards talk on the campus of the closed McKinley school, part of the Los Angeles Unified school district system, in Compton, California, just south of Los Angeles, in late April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI can\u2019t get my kids to connect,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m over here like: \u2018Can someone text me back, please? Anyone? I know you hear me because I see the message on \u2018read\u2019. You have to graduate next month but you have to do some work for me to pass you in good faith.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Her students are dealing with a lot: one has been couch surfing, three have become full-time caregivers because their parents are working. A couple have full-time jobs they are still going to because their work is considered \u201cessential\u201d work.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOne of my students up and left town,\u201d Steely said. \u201cI\u2019ve been altering his assignments so he could do them on his phone. Half my students didn\u2019t have computers. It was a whole ordeal trying to get them the devices and now we\u2019re dealing with bad connections.\u201d</p> <p>Angela Der Ramos, who teaches sixth graders in <a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/27661420000000/2019#mathematics-card\">Salinas</a>, a central-coast city made famous by John Steinbeck, has been working to keep kids tuned in, turning quizzes into games and focusing on reading, percentages and ratios \u2013 lessons that will build skills they will depend on for life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many families speak a language other than English at home, she said, and face some of the \u201chidden challenges\u201d known to teachers: lack of access to the internet, overcrowded housing and concerns over immigration status.</p> <p>\u201cIn one of my student\u2019s families, three children and their mom rent a room inside a house,\u201d said Der Ramos. \u201cWhere is he going to go to log on to a computer?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Of the 27 students in Der Ramos\u2019s class, only about six routinely log in, she said. About 10 other students aren\u2019t regulars, but do some of the work, enough for Der Ramos to say, \u201cOK, good. You\u2019re alive and at least engaging in some way\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd95cbc9f191557d5c07aaad1ea83c9e1debd210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd95cbc9f191557d5c07aaad1ea83c9e1debd210/0_750_2250_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Johnson at his office desk in Manteca, where he\u2019s been taking meals during 12-hour work days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Johnson at his office desk in Manteca, where he has been taking meals during 12-hour work days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Ken Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shift to distance learning affected school districts unevenly. In Menlo Park, an affluent Bay-area community in the heart of Silicon Valley, officials chalk up a relatively smooth transition to the fact that most students in the district had access to devices going into the lockdown \u2013 in addition to teachers who were trained in distance learning techniques.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the same wasn\u2019t true in many rural or disadvantaged areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ken Johnson, a high school government teacher and president of the teachers union in <a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/39685930000000/2019\">Manteca</a>, a Central Valley town an hour east of San Francisco, said he has been working 12-hour days, taking meals at his desk, in part because he and other educators had to create distance learning plans from scratch.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the hardest I\u2019ve ever worked in my life. We\u2019re doing things on the fly. Everyday is different. If the software is glitchy, you have to become Mr Google and figure it out,\u201d Johnson said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Johnson said he has encountered an irony facing a generation of digital natives in his classes.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe funny thing is that kids can spend the entire day on Instagram or TikTok, but when it comes to taking a picture of their work and uploading it \u2026 or even just sending an email, that\u2019s something they apparently don\u2019t know how to do,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s like learning to teach all over again\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Distance learning has upended the entire way educators teach, throwing a wrench into years of professional training and finely tuned lesson plans.&nbsp;Teaching sixth-graders in Salinas, Der Ramos said she had come to rely on students\u2019 body language, the way they roll their eyes or drift off when they are not interested.&nbsp;</p> <p>But online teaching has blunted her ability to read her students \u2013 especially when so many seem to be hesitant to show their face, or the inside of their homes, to the camera. (All teachers interviewed for this story noted the same.)&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cTeachers normally have to play a little psychology with our students \u2013 but this is harder, because we\u2019re not in front of them. When I teach online I\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t call on students to answer,\u201d she said. \u201cIn real life you can sort of stare them down until they respond, but start calling on them online and one by one you\u2019ll see them start to log off, like \u2018byeee\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Teaching math is a particular challenge, teachers say. Teaching math concepts involves looking at students\u2019 work and seeing where they went wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about? Making mistakes is what a lot of teaching is based on. But in this case we don\u2019t have the same opportunity to go through the actual work in the same way,\u201d said Der Ramos.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like having to learn to teach all over again, but underwater. And we don\u2019t have the oxygen to share with the students.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I miss my students\u2019</h2> <p>Teachers say much of their time since lockdown started has been consumed by in-the-moment logistics and planning for the future.&nbsp;But it is also proving to be an emotional time for teachers \u2013 both for their students and their own families.&nbsp;</p> <p>Steely in San Diego, for example, said she has been gobsmacked by the amount of homework given by her twins\u2019 teacher.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMy boys have six hours of homework each day, plus Zoom calls. I\u2019ve seen some complaints about teachers not assigning students enough work. I think those are in bad taste, let\u2019s be real,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among Steely\u2019s biggest concerns for her students is what will happen after summer. School officials in California are looking at dividing the student body in half and staggering school schedules to allow for more space to physically distance. But that creates a major problem for Steely.</p> <p>\u201cAs a family, we were all waiting for our kids to be in school so the money we paid in childcare could finally go to other things. And it\u2019s not just us. A lot of parents rely on public schools for childcare,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ba387ad11c2ec85fa5a0da89f1022197a456575\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ba387ad11c2ec85fa5a0da89f1022197a456575/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelly Steely\u2019s converted-closet office in San Diego.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelly Steely\u2019s converted-closet office in San Diego.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Shelly Steely</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One and a half hours north, in Santa Ana, Andres said she has also been surprised by the timing of some parents\u2019 feedback.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAs we\u2019re nearing the end of the school year I\u2019ve had a flood of parents whose students haven\u2019t been doing anything for the past eight weeks and are suddenly very interested in how their kids are going to get caught up,\u201d Andres said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Johnson in Manteca is coming to terms with the fact he wasn\u2019t able to close out the year with a group of students, many of whom postponed plans to leave for college in order to help their parents pull through the pandemic and its financial toll.</p> <p>\u201cI miss my students. I won\u2019t be able to be at their graduation. I want to be able to see them after their graduation and hear their laughter and stupid jokes. That\u2019s why teachers teach \u2013 we have that rapport with our students where we\u2019re just feeding off of it,\u201d said Johnson.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t been able to see my kids finish growing up. I\u2019ve been doing this 31 years and I still get teared up talking about this.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Still, he has been touched and encouraged by his students\u2019 thoughtful responses to lockdown measures</p> <p>\u201cThey say they\u2019re bored, but they don\u2019t want to go outside because they don\u2019t want to bring the virus home to mom and dad or grandpa,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThese kids, they get it. Even as young as they are, they understand how serious this is and they\u2019re concerned for others. It gives you hope for the future, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

One of the helicopters had Red Cross markings and the show of force is being investigated by the national guard, according to the Washington Post. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T03:30:37.346Z\">at 4.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed703518f08f5e373013753\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:04:20.190Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Thousands of protesters have rallied peacefully outside of the White House</strong> on Tuesday evening, chanting \u201ckeep the peace\u201d as night grew dark. </p> \n  <p>The crowd grew thinner after 8pm, an hour after the capital\u2019s curfew had set in, but several hundred remained outside of the fence. </p> \n  <p>When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u201d George \u201cTJ\u201d Pierce, one of the protesters in the park, told the Associated Press.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9/0_110_3320_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda/0_113_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:32:53.966Z\">at 3.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed6ff4d8f084df971c8ea0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/julianborger\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T01:53:24.973Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Analysis: Trump has normalised mayhem and the US is paying the price</strong></p> \n  <p>The sheer tumult of the Trump era, the unceasing torrent of events that were unthinkable even hours before, has left a nation constantly off balance, unable to find its bearing and grasp how far it has traveled.</p> \n  <p>The developments of the past 24 hours were a reminder of how slippery the downward slope has been. </p> \n  <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/100000-dead-in-the-us\">a hundred thousand Americans are dead from a pandemic</a> after the government\u2019s botched response; there are armoured cars and troops outside Washington metro stations; men in combat gear carrying sniper rifles were seen perched in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/1267815222619799552\">open door of a helicopter</a> flying low over the commercial district.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.

On Kangaroo Island that included providing reverse osmosis machines to create drinking water for livestock and to fly in 65,000 litres of drinking water for humans. </p> \n  <p>Johnson said it was the first time the ADF has been called out to assist with bushfire recovery.

McManus said the principle behind the Better Off Overall Test \u201cis a good one\u201d \u2013 that awards are the minimum conditions and enterprise agreements should therefore improve on that base line.</p> \n  <p>She said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We want to see Australian workers get fair pay rises.

He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at a discrete small number of awards in the industries where there has been the greatest damage wrought by Covid-19 and the necessary health responses. So the point that I make is that the hospitality award is a very complicated award. And when you listen to employers and employees who work in the system, they will note the demarcation between tasks \u2013 the 61 different pay-points and 14 different permutations creates regulatory barriers to the hiring and preservation of employees. So we are looking at ways that you can potentially simplify awards in a very narrow range of what are at the moment very distressed industries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Porter reiterated that Morrison had been clear the ensuring integrity bill will not be put for a vote in the Senate, but still took a swipe at the construction union:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would hope that in a time where Australia is facing the greatest economic challenge outside of a world war that it has ever faced, that people on construction sites who have been behaving in an unlawful way dial it the hell down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:28:33.467Z\">at 8.28am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed747038f084df971c8eb48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:45:53.833Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>AAP has an update on the stock market:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The Australian share market has rallied to its highest level since 6 March, with gains across nearly every sector on a wave of optimism about Australia\u2019s economic prospects.</p> \n   <p>The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed Wednesday close to the highs of the day, up 106.5 points, or 1.83%, at 5,941.6 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 104.8 points, or 1.76%, at 6,064.9.</p> \n   <p>One Australian dollar was buying 69.36 US cents, up from 68.02 US cents at the close of trade on Tuesday.</p> \n   <p>The Aussie reached 69.84 US cents earlier on Wednesday, its highest point since early January. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:29:21.413Z\">at 8.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed73f298f087122eca548b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:14:59.568Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the ABC, Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, is asked by <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> what should happen to the jobseeker payment. </p> \n  <p>It is currently at about $1,100 a fortnight with the coronavirus supplement, but that will be halved from the end of September. </p> \n  <p>He says it shouldn\u2019t \u201csnap back\u201d to the old rate, but declines to give a figure, saying \u201cwe need to be really responsible with the budget.

  "<p>Boris Johnson has opened the path to what he called one of the \u201cbiggest changes\u201d to the British visa system, stating he was ready to offer a right to live and work in the UK to any of the nearly 3 million Hong Kong citizens eligible for a British National Overseas passport.</p> <p>Ministers have been ambivalent since last Thursday on whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">the UK government\u2019s offer of an extendable 12-month visa </a>would be available only to the 350,000 current BNO passport holders in Hong Kong, or would also include the more than 2.5 million eligible to apply for the passport.</p> <p>In the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong\">implied the offer was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong\"> available only to the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong\">narrower group</a>, stressing the government needed to be realistic about what it could offer. However, writing in the Times on Wednesday,, Johnson appeared to make a far wider offer to all those eligible to hold a BNO passport.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s offer would come into play only if China presses ahead with new security laws that strip Hong Kong of its traditional freedoms.</p> <p>Johnson wrote in the Times that if the security laws were pursued, \u201cBritain would have no choice but to uphold our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cToday about 350,000 people hold British Nationals (Overseas) passports and another 2.5 million people would be eligible to apply for them. At present these passports allow for visa free access for up to six months.</p> <p>\u201cIf China imposes its national security law, the British government will change its immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights including the right to work which would place them on the route to citizenship.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThis would amount to one of the biggest changes to our visa system in history. If it proves necessary Britain will take this step and take it willingly.\u201d</p> <p>In the Commons, Raab seemed more circumspect, saying: \u201cWe have said that we will allow the 300,000-plus passport holders, along with their dependants, to come to the UK in the way I described.\u201d</p> <p>It is not known how many of these eligible for a BNO passport would apply, but Raab said in the event of a mass exodus he would hope the burden would be shared internationally.</p> <p>The ambiguity in the UK government position about the precise extent of its offer to Hong Kong citizens, and the pathway to citizenship, may reflect differences within the cabinet.&nbsp;It could also reflect a British desire to leave China guessing about the potential scale of a British-enabled brain drain from Hong Kong, if Beijing seeks to suppress human rights in the territory.</p> <p>Johnson also used his article to make a final appeal to China to reconsider its actions, urging the leaders in Beijing to realise that with power came the need for magnanimity.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cBritain does not seek to prevent China\u2019s rise; on the contrary we will work side by side on all the issues where our interests converge, from trade to climate change. We want a modern and mature relationship, based on mutual respect and recognising China\u2019s place in the world.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it is precisely because we welcome China as a leading member of the world community that we expect it to abide by international agreements.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Lee, a barrister, former legislator and co-drafter of the basic law, said the offers by foreign governments to help people from Hong Kong people were generous, but not enough.</p> <p>\u201cBecause no matter how generous you are in the provision of passports and so on, there are still large numbers of people who are not eligible for one reason or another,\u201d Lee told the Guardian.</p> <p>This included young people who protested over the past year, more than 8,000 of whom were arrested and feared further charges under the national security laws.</p> <p>\u201cSo I want more, and I want the international community to put their heads together and come up with a multinational sustainable solution for Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>He said Beijing had clearly breached its treaty obligations. The then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had made great efforts in 1997 to have the declaration supported by the international community and registered in the United Nations, Lee said, precisely to ensure Hong Kong\u2019s elite residents and businesses did not flee. \u201cWhen I say I want them to do more I mean hold China to the original policy.\u201d </p> <p>Johnson\u2019s article was welcomed as a \u201cremarkable intervention\u201d by Johnny Patterson, director of the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch. He said: \u201cIt is a watershed moment in Sino-British relations.&nbsp;No sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover.</p> <p>\u201cIt reflects two things, first the severity of the situation on the ground, and second the fact that the British government genuinely, and rightly, feel a sense of duty to citizens of Hong Kong and are going to do all they can to stop them becoming the collateral&nbsp;damage of escalating geopolitical tensions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Near the end of <em>The Mystery of Charles Dickens</em>, AN Wilson quotes at length from a letter written by Philip Larkin to his lover Monica Jones. The poet has just reread <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-great-expectations\">Great Expectations</a></em>, and is reflecting on the novelist\u2019s attention-seeking tricks: \u201cSay what you like about Dickens as an entertainer, he cannot be considered a real writer at all; not a real novelist.\u201d It is a version of a complaint that has been made many times about Dickens the mere \u201centertainer\u201d. \u201cHis is the garish, gaslit, melodramatic barn \u2026 where the yokels gape.\u201d Yet, at the end of all his sentences of critical deprecation, Larkin\u2019s final reflex is equally familiar: \u201cHowever, I much enjoyed G.E. &amp; may try another soon.\u201d</p> <p>Those with high literary standards have often enjoyed Dickens against their better judgment. In <em>The Mystery of Charles Dickens</em>, Wilson sides with the gaping yokels. He confesses the he has read Dickens with \u201cobsessive rapture\u201d since his childhood, but had to overcome the presumption, later educated into him, that his writing was insufficiently deep or sophisticated. \u201cThe death of Paul Dombey is so schmaltzy that we simply refuse to be moved, but then, damn it, we read and the tears well down our cheeks.\u201d For Wilson, Dickens is an irresistible performer. One chapter of his book is devoted to \u201cThe Mystery of the Public Readings\u201d, in which Dickens drove himself to near collapse (and made huge amounts of money) by touring America as well as Britain to perform readings from his work. In 1869, he had a stroke on stage in Chester, but still refused to stop the readings, partly because of the money but mostly because he was addicted to the instant responsiveness of his audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3390db17623d4697e735e03c7621fd2bcc4e21fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3390db17623d4697e735e03c7621fd2bcc4e21fb/0_28_1849_2311/800.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Dickens.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He was, after all, a nobody\u2019 \u2026 Charles Dickens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The highlight of his show was Bill Sikes\u2019s murder of Nancy from <em>Oliver Twist</em>, in which, Wilson thinks, the novelist released some demonic aspect of himself \u2013 some yen for sexual violence \u2013 on stage. Murderous villains such as the gleefully sadistic Quilp in <em>The Old Curiosity Shop,</em> or the psychopathic John Jasper in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/jan/06/edwin-drood-dickens-mystery-solved\">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</a>,</em> were projections of his own cruelty. Wilson\u2019s book is, you might say, bio-critical: \u201cDickens\u2019s novels tell the story over and over again of his divided self,\u201d he writes. The secrets of his life lie on the surface of his fiction. The dust jacket proclaims that the book goes \u201cbeyond standard narrative biography\u201d. Which is to say that <em>The Mystery of Charles Dickens</em> does not reveal anything the previous biographers have not told us (indeed, it is conscientiously reliant on a small number of secondary sources). Instead, it shows, by a mixture of rational inference and I-feel-it-in-my-bones intuition, how the most powerful aspects of Dickens\u2019s fiction drew on the most painful and secret aspects of his life.</p> <p>The biggest secret of Dickens\u2019s life, of course, was his clandestine relationship with Ellen (\u201cNelly\u201d) Ternan, the young actor whom he first met when she performed at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester in <em>The Frozen Deep</em>, a play that he had written with his friend Wilkie Collins, and in which he himself was acting. She was 18; he was 45. For the next 13 years, Dickens paid for her to live in a series of discreetly located residences, where he would secretly visit her. The last of these was Windsor Lodge in Peckham, then a pleasant village outside London, with a railway station on the line from Dickens\u2019s Kent home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The 'seizure' that killed Dickens must have been induced by energetic sex, the dying novelist was then driven to his Kent home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Each chapter of Wilson\u2019s book is a different \u201cMystery\u201d, the first being what happened to most of the \u00a322 for which Dickens cashed a cheque on the day before his death. Dickens must have given it to Nelly for housekeeping. Which means that he must have made a quick trip to Peckham and that the \u201cseizure\u201d that killed him must have been induced by some hyper-energetic sex with her. Which means that hasty measures must have been taken to heave the dying novelist into a carriage to be driven back to his Kent home. \u201cExit Nelly, stage left.\u201d (This enjoyable fiction, which has been hazarded by others before Wilson, is partly withdrawn near the end of the book.)</p> <p>Next is \u201cThe Mystery of his Childhood\u201d. Wilson is hardly the first to suggest that Dickens\u2019s fiction was shaped by what he calls \u201cthe grotesquely sad galanty show of his childhood\u201d. He briskly takes us through the story of the penury, the period in the debtors\u2019 prison, the aborted education, the banishment, aged 10, to menial labour in Warren\u2019s Blacking warehouse. There is less stress than usual on the improvidence of Dickens\u2019s father, John Dickens (whose self-relishing orotundity at least inspired the matchless idiolect of Mr Micawber). Instead, Dickens blamed his mother. The ludicrous (Mrs Nickleby) or monstrous (Mrs Clennam) mothers in his novels bear the imprint of \u201cthe deepest needs of mother-hate\u201d. Wilson asserts that \u201chis flawed relationship with his mother is the defining feature, of the man and of his art\u201d. Yet his privations made him a great novelist. The Blacking warehouse \u201csaved Dickens the novelist, just as grammar school and Cambridge would have destroyed him\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We should be grateful Dickens was so screwed up. Great Expectations, Wilson believes, was a masterpiece of self-torment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then there is \u201cThe Mystery of the Cruel Marriage\u201d. Nothing has more tainted Dickens\u2019s reputation than his public repudiation (via an advertisement in the Times) of his wife, Kate, who had borne him 10 children and suffered all his demands for 22 years. Wilson\u2019s house, he tells us, overlooks the back garden of 70 Gloucester Crescent, Camden Town, whence Catherine Dickens was exiled, with the company of only one of her children, Charley, their eldest son. The others were forbidden to see her. We have found out recently that Dickens tried to have her certified insane, so that she would be put in an asylum. Not only did he want to be free to pursue an affair with Nelly Ternan, he wanted somehow to declare that it was all his blameless wife\u2019s fault. He was the wounded party.</p> <p>But all the fury and resentment that he felt towards first his mother, and then his wife, inspired his greatest fiction, Wilson thinks. We should be grateful that he was so screwed up. <em>Great Expectations</em>, he believes, was a masterpiece of self-torment, formed from his own ruthlessness, his hunger for money and status, his family hatreds \u2013 all handed down to the novel\u2019s narrator, Pip. \u201cA helpful course of cognitive therapy, such as our contemporaries would have urged on a middle-aged man who had just visited such absolute mayhem on his wife and children\u201d would have destroyed his creativity. Just as Pip owed his fortune to a violent criminal, Magwitch, its author owed his lucrative brilliance to \u201ca secret, violent criminal\u201d: himself. Or rather, the dark and nasty secret self that he never consciously acknowledged.</p> <p>Wilson concedes all the contradictions and hypocrisies anatomised by John Carey in his brilliant, often openly exasperated study of Dickens, <em>The Violent Effigy</em> \u2013 but forgives him. Dickens had to contend with the \u201cvast, smoky, cruel, boundlessly energetic, steel-hearted nineteenth century\u201d, which made him variously cruel and sentimental. He was, after all, a nobody, who had grown up \u201cwith nuffink\u201d. Alone among all great writers of the 19th century, he had \u201cnot merely looked over into the abyss. He had lived in it.\u201d His lifelong insecurity was another creative asset.</p> <p>If you are a Dickens aficionado, you will think that much of the book\u2019s biographical narrative is well-known material, though here revisited in a sprightly manner. Yet its last, highly personal section suddenly shifts your sense of Wilson\u2019s commitment to his subject. In his final chapter, he remembers first encountering episodes from Dickens at the age of eight or nine at his private school, which was \u201cin effect a concentration camp run by sexual perverts\u201d. The teacher who introduced him to Dickens was himself utterly sinister and Dickensian, the skill with which he impersonated Fagin and Squeers \u201call too convincing\u201d. The shards of Dickens sustained his spirits among the privations and abuse visited on him by the paedophile headmaster and his monstrous wife, uninhibited sadists in Wilson\u2019s vivid, detailed account. After this, nothing would convince him that Dickens should be condescended to as insufficiently \u201crealistic\u201d. And in returning him to the \u201cabject terror and hopelessness\u201d of childhood, but with that strange Dickensian stir of laughter (Fagin and Squeers, those comic turns), the novelist, hypocritical and self-deceiving as he might have been, has done him some matchless kindness.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Mystery of Charles Dickens is published by Atlantic (\u00a317.99).</em></p>",

  "<p>So we have a new dress code: a picnic with an exclusive six-person guest list. Sorry, did I say dress code? I meant new social distancing rules. Anyway, like I said: a picnic \u2013 or a barbecue \u2013 in the park or in the garden, with an exclusive six-person guest list.<br><br>A stroll through my local park confirms that the new behavioural guidelines are being read as a new uniform. Anywhere on a sunny patch of grass, you are guaranteed to be exactly two metres away from a picnic dress. There are puffed sleeves and broderie anglaise. There are ditsy florals and polka dots. There are midi-length gingham dresses in chic monochrome, by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/ganni/smocked-checked-cotton-blend-seersucker-maxi-dress/1227765?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;cm_mmc=Google-ProductSearch-UK--c-_-NAP_EN_UK_PLA-_-NAP%C2%A0-%C2%A0UK%C2%A0-%C2%A0GS%C2%A0-+Designer+-+Class_Clothing%C2%A0-+Type_Dresses%C2%A0-%C2%A0High%C2%A0-%C2%A0CSS--Dresses+-+Maxi_INTL&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwztL2BRATEiwAvnALcoiFQU-QfoqnXyInIuGVKSDh3PzEMjlSF6YR6w0uWbvnflyixSxAYBoCJP8QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Ganni</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"348a7aef6d7c2f3cdde39700ac4883d22cdf0f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/348a7aef6d7c2f3cdde39700ac4883d22cdf0f02/0_0_2100_2940/714.jpg\" alt=\"Summer dress, &amp; Other Stories.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Summer dress, &amp; Other Stories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are green-as-grass colours and puffed cotton sleeves, like this dress from <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/puff-sleeve-dress-p07385106.html?v1=46094399&amp;v2=1445860\">Zara</a>.

The women who spent last winter wearing modishly austere, Little Women-esque prairie-style long-sleeve, high-neck dresses with ankle boots to the office are now to be found in pale florals and ruffle-trimmed picture necklines.</p> <p>The picnic dress is the new tracksuit. If the tracksuit was the uniform of Stay at Home, the picnic dress is Have Fun (but Sensibly, and Outside.) This is what a picnic dress stands for. Polka dots and florals are upbeat, but civilised. Smocking and puffed sleeves are summery without being provocative. Even the many gatherings in my local park, which are picnics in the impromptu sense \u2013 silvery tins of gin and tonic from the Tesco Express over the road, 99 Flakes from the ice-cream van \u2013 feature women adorned with vintage florals and delicately gathered pintucks.<br><br>The psychology of the picnic dress is fascinating. Is it OK to wear celebration frocks in a pandemic? Where does Keep Calm and Carry On end, and Marie Antoinette at the Petit Trianon begin? No one knows the answer to these questions, which is precisely why the picnic dress is emerging as the go-to summer look. The iconography of picnicking, with its teddy bears and wicker baskets, is wholesome fun rather than hedonistic abandon. If we can agree that it is acceptable \u2013 even desirable \u2013 to find joy and love and beauty where we can, in the midst of all this, then the picnic dress channels summery pleasures at an appropriate pitch. Broderie anglaise says, I am here with my friends and family, and not to swap bodily fluids with randoms. Gingham says, I will go home before it gets dark and I start bumping into each people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c89a6b692bcfcfd93bfa0517609d0bd68ee4e2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c89a6b692bcfcfd93bfa0517609d0bd68ee4e2c3/0_0_2048_3072/667.jpg\" alt=\"Floral dress, Zara.com.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Floral dress, Zara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zara</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>And picnic dressing is more practical than it looks, as we head into a time of daycations and staycations. The unseasonable heatwave of the past week has given us an easy ride into a summer in which it seems that what socialising we are able to do will mostly take place outdoors. Al-fresco dressing in the British summer means keeping warm as well as keeping cool, and a picnic aesthetic works in scenarios where your swimwear-and-beach-cover-up holiday wardrobe will not. A good picnic dress knows how to look summery without being skimpy, which is useful on days when it is a bit goosebumpy in the shade. A picnic dress can be fitted around the waist but it will be loose around the thighs, which is important because it means you can sprawl comfortably on a blanket rather than clamp your knees demurely as necessitated by sitting on the floor in a short skirt. Oh, and a picnic dress is always a dress, not a jumpsuit. If your al-fresco socialising is taking place anywhere other than your own garden, this is a time for a dress, not a jumpsuit.<br>And picnic dressing isn\u2019t just about the dress. <a href=\"https://www.loveshackfancy.com/collections/white\">Love Shack Fancy</a>, an American brand with an irresistible Laura-Ashley-goes-to-LA sunny-boho vibe, is the escapist fantasy shopping label of the moment, not just for dresses but for gossamer-fine cardigans \u2013 the Folley, in a wool-mohair blend with vintage style rose buttons, comes in a perfect summer-sky blue. Shoes should be easy to slide off, for picnic blanket etiquette. <a href=\"https://www.dunelondon.com/loupe-smart-slider-sandal-tan-0079504510016511/\">The Loupe sandal by Dune</a> &nbsp;will work as brilliantly on holiday, if you should ever get one, as it does in the park. This strangest of summers calls for uncomplicated clothes. Real life isn\u2019t exactly a picnic right now. But your summer wardrobe can be.<br></p>",

  "<p>In the morning, reassurance, in the evening, another mass killing.&nbsp;</p> <p>When the governor for Sokoto state in north-west Nigeria arrived in Sabon Birni, a district reeling from relentless killings by armed groups, he assured local officials that authorities were in control.
