In the past month, at least two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">pairs</a> of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8201467/Twin-sisters-66-die-coronavirus-four-days-other.html\">twins</a> have died in Britain and two pairs of brothers, all within hours or days of each other. But do the deaths point to genetic factors that make some more likely than others to succumb to the disease?</p> \n  <p>Most scientists believe that genes play a role in how people respond to infections. A person\u2019s genetic makeup may influence the receptors that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells. How resilient the person is to the infection, their general health, and how the immune system reacts will also have some genetic component.</p> \n  <p>A team led by Prof Tim Spector, head of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, has reported that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/study-of-twins-reveals-genetic-effect-on-covid-19-symptoms\">symptoms appear to be 50% genetic</a>. </p> \n  <p>But Spector said more work is needed to understand which genes are involved and what difference they make to the course of the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there are genes linked to the receptors or genes linked to how the infection presents,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese deaths alert people to the fact that this could be genetic, but when people live together they share an environment as well,\u201d Spector said. The upshot is that twins who live together are more likely to have similar lifestyles and behaviours, from diet and exercise habits to how quickly they seek medical care. Twins are not generally less healthy than the wider population. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/genetics-in-focus-after-coronavirus-deaths-of-siblings-and-twins\">Genetics in focus after coronavirus deaths of siblings and twins</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb159848f083e60eea309f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:19:11.765Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The mayor of <strong>The Hague</strong> has issued a statement ordering police to break up a demonstration by around 200 people who had gathered to protest against measures ordered by the government to slow the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. </p> \n  <p>Police said in a statement that they were \u201cdetaining demonstrators that ignore the mayor\u2019s order\u201d. <span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Local press agency ANP said dozens had been detained.</span></p> \n  <p>The Dutch government has banned public gatherings since mid-March, with people required to stand at least 1.5 metres apart in public spaces.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:54:17.226Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb1584b8f083e60eea309f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:17:05.083Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Overcrowded, unhygienic prisons in <strong>Latin America</strong> and the spread of the coronavirus both in regional prisons and in the <strong>US</strong> are a source of \u201cmajor concern\u201d, the UN rights office (OHCHR) has said. </p> \n  <p>In some cases, fear of infection has led to riots, killing dozens of inmates in <strong>Venezuela, Peru and Colombia</strong> in recent weeks. </p> \n  <p>OHCHR called for prompt, independent investigations into these incidents. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn many countries of Latin America, you have really serious overcrowding,\u201d OHCHR spokesman <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Rupert Colville</strong> told a Geneva briefing, referring to the trend as \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chronic problem across the continent and in some cases it can be deadly,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>In some places, overcapacity levels are as high as 500%, a UN official said, adding that new detentions due to violations of Covid-19 measures in places like Peru have exacerbated this.</p> \n  <p>The UN has already voiced concern over hundreds of thousands of people arrested or detained for quarantine violations. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the situation in US jails, he said that thousands of cases of infections in prisons were a \u201cmajor concern\u201d, naming specifically <strong>New York and Chicago</strong>.

The total number of cases stands at 3,582,469. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 251,510.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong economy suffers deepest contraction. </strong>Hong Kong\u2019s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, has recorded its worst decline on record.The region\u2019s GDP shrunk 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Chief executive Carrie Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.</li> \n   <li><strong>Five Eyes network contradicts theory Covid-19 leaked from lab.</strong>There is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/five-eyes-network-contradicts-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-lab\">intelligence sources have told the Guardian</a>, contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof this is how the pandemic began.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>WHO says has no proof from US on \u2018speculative\u2019 Wuhan lab claims. </strong>The World Health Organization said Monday that Washington had provided no evidence to support \u201cspeculative\u201d claims by US president Donald Trump and Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>Fauci says there is no scientific evidence virus came from Chinese laboratory. </strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the foremost US expert on infections diseases and a key member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said in an interview with National Geographic that there is <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/anthony-fauci-no-scientific-evidence-the-coronavirus-was-made-in-a-chinese-lab-cvd/\">no scientific basis</a> for the theory that coronavirus was man-made in a Chinese laboratory, or escaped from a laboratory after being brought in from the wild.</li> \n   <li><strong>Chinese state media on Monday denounced Mike Pompeo as \u201cinsane</strong>\u201d. Pompeo has also joined Trump in attacking the World Health Organization, which said Monday it had no evidence that the virus came out of a laboratory.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was also asked about the lab theory. </strong>Morrison said there had been no change to the Australian position on the theory, which is that no possibilities could be ruled out, but the most likely origin of the virus is a wildlife wet market. He reiterated calls for a \u201ctransparent\u201d review into the outbreak and the World Health Organization\u2019s response to the outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand records no new cases for second day in a row,</strong> as the government considers whether to further relax the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions. Monday was the first time since before New Zealand\u2019s national shutdown began on 25 March that there were no new cases of the virus diagnosed. </li> \n   <li><strong>Australia and New Zealand confirm plans for \u201csafe travel zone\u201d. </strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have officially confirmed plans for a \u201csafe travel zone\u201d between the two countries.

Italy and Spain each said they would provide more than \u20ac100m.</li> \n   <li><strong>Austrian unemployment at all-time high. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%.</li> \n   <li><strong>Carnival to resume cruises in August. </strong>Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry\u2019s possible role in spreading the disease around the globe.</li> \n   <li><strong>Plane carrying aid supplies crashes in Somalia. </strong>The accident, involving an African Express Airways plane<strong>, </strong>killed seven people on board, a security official said.</li> \n   <li><strong>US supreme court</strong><strong> hears arguments by teleconference for first time</strong>.

  "<p>Would Alaska\u2019s Mount Denali \u2013 the highest peak in the US \u2013 be as tall if it was situated on the equator instead? Might the Himalayas be even taller if an ice age took hold? Every mountain range is sculpted by rain and wind, but some mountain belts are also sliced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/glaciers\">glaciers</a>, producing the classic horn-shaped peaks, knife-edge ridges and amphitheatre-like valleys, known as \u201ccirques\u201d.

And because glaciers create such \u201cskinny\u201d mountains, they show that the underlying crust (like icebergs, mountains have extensive crustal roots) does not need to be as thick as it would for a non-glacial peak.</p> <p>Which suggests that all things being equal, Denali wouldn\u2019t be as tall if it had popped up in Mexico instead of Alaska.

They are expected to return to the training pitch on Wednesday, when federal government guidelines will limit contact work and the size of groups to 10. Those measures are in line with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/01/community-sport-resume-australia-coronavirus-restrictions\">Australian Institute of Sport\u2019s phased return to sport at all levels</a>.</p> <p>Once the season does get back underway, teams will play 18 consecutive games in a shortened 20-round season (two rounds had been completed before the suspension). The grand final will be played on 25 October, with State of Origin to be played in the weeks after that, although no concrete date has been set yet.</p> <p>The Warriors were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/warriors-given-green-light-to-enter-australia-and-train-for-nrl-season-starting-on-28-may\">granted a travel exemption</a> to ensure all 16 teams will contest the remainder of the season. The team flew in from New Zealand on Sunday and will be in quarantine for 14 days in Tamworth before moving to the Central Coast, where they hope to play the rest of the season.</p> <p>Details of how the remaining 18 rounds will look have not yet been finalised. A revised broadcast deal with partners Foxtel and Channel Nine has not been reached yet, but details of player payments for the revised competition have been agreed \u2013 an 80% cut for the rest of the season.</p> <h2>Australian rules football</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: end of June</strong></p> <p>Now that travel restrictions have eased, the majority of clubs are beginning to recall players from interstate breaks, although no official restart date has been announced. There is hope that training might resume next week, in accordance with the government\u2019s phased return to sport plan.</p> <p>Details of what shape any resumed season will take have not yet been finalised, but there is increasing optimism it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/04/afl-almost-past-controversial-hub-idea-as-covid-19-cases-decline-says-sport-minister\">will not involve large-scale quarantine hubs</a>. The idea of players leaving their families for a long period \u2013 up to 20 weeks \u2013 was largely ill-received but the sports minister Richard Colback this week said the AFL has \u201calmost moved past that model now\u201d.</p> <p>A more traditional home-and-away fixture is expected to be able to be completed, with the season suspended after just one round was played before the coronavirus outbreak took hold. A resumption date in June for a modified season is hoped for.</p> <h2>Rugby union</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: July</strong></p> <p>Rugby Australia has submitted a return to play document to the federal government, but the code is not expected to resume until July. The document, worked on by RA\u2019s return-to-play committee, includes guidelines and details on biosecurity issues and medical provisions around training.</p> <p>It is unlikely RA will make any return-to-play announcement until next week, with the players expected to have three to four weeks training together before contesting any matches. Super Rugby was suspended in mid-March after seven rounds after Australia and New Zealand introduced isolation policies due to concern over the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Sanzaar has acknowledged any return to play by its teams this year would have a strong domestic focus, given possible travel, border and government restrictions. RA\u2019s preferred format is a domestic round-robin home-and-away tournament including the four Super Rugby teams and possibly Western Force.</p> <p>It is believed they would seek to avoid any hub scenario pending government restrictions and the ability to travel interstate.</p> <h2>Football</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: August</strong></p> <p>A-League clubs are preparing for a competition restart in August with Wellington Phoenix to base themselves in New South Wales for a two-week quarantine period. Football Federation Australia is yet to officially detail the league\u2019s resumption, but clubs are preparing for a July training phase ahead of an August return to games.</p> <p>The league was suspended on 24 March with five rounds, plus finals, remaining. All games are likely to be played in Sydney at venues without spectators. An extra hurdle to potentially overcome lies in which stadiums to use, given the NRL is likely to run concurrently at cross-code venues such as Kogarah and Bankwest Stadium.</p> <h2>Netball</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: unknown</strong></p> <p>The 2020 season was supposed to start the beginning of May and details on what any revised campaign might look like are at this stage sparse. But Super Netball has been working through scenario planning and is \u201copen-minded to possible season models\u201d, according to CEO Chris Symington.</p> <p>The organisation will be in a position to make an announcement by the end of May, while a decision on whether the Quad Series and Constellation Cup can be held as scheduled in September and October \u2013 featuring Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England \u2013 will be made in the coming weeks.</p> <h2>Cricket</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: unknown</strong></p> <p>Any official decisions on how the summer of cricket will look have yet to be made, but all eyes will be on how the coronavirus affects India, who are due in Australia late this year, and in turn any international travel ban that may impact the team\u2019s ability to tour.</p> <p>Depending on how efforts to contain the outbreak go locally, the major domestic competitions, including the Sheffield Shield, Big Bash League and Women\u2019s Big Bash League, may yet begin as scheduled.</p> <p>The men\u2019s national team end their annual leave period on 18 May and while the June tour of Bangladesh has already been cancelled, the ECB is reportedly hopeful of getting Justin Langer\u2019s side to tour England in September. But the safety of players in a nation that has been severely hit by the coronavirus would have to be guaranteed if that were to go ahead.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>With Australian Associated Press</em></p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Tens of thousands of migrants are trapped in dangerous conditions at frontiers, mines, ports and in transit camps across Africa after states shut their borders in an attempt to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Some have been abandoned by smugglers unable to take them further on their journeys to Europe or elsewhere. Others were returning home or moving across the continent in search of work when frontiers were closed in March.</p> \n<p>They include large numbers of Chadian students stranded in Cameroon, about 1,800 Nigerien workers stuck in remote goldmining areas in Burkina Faso, and more than 1,000 migrants from Mali and Senegal trapped in Mauritania.</p> \n<p>In east Africa, about 2,300 migrants are stranded in Djibouti after being abandoned by traffickers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/29/people-traffickers-fire-at-refugees-forcing-them-into-sea-off-yemen-coast\">Most were hoping to cross the Red Sea to Yemen</a> and then reach Saudi Arabia and the Arabian peninsula, mainly in search of work.</p> \n<p>The migrants are among the marginalised communities who are most vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  "<p>To exist at this moment is to navigate (or try to fend off) the flood of grief that threatens to submerge even our rare, buoyant moments. We mourn the death of friends and relatives, the absence of human contact and the everyday pleasures we once took for granted. We can\u2019t stop thinking about the tens of thousands of families facing hunger, bankruptcy and homelessness even as they struggle to endure the loss of someone they dearly loved.</p> <p>What\u2019s striking, if not surprising, is that this deluge of sorrow has run dry at the door to the Oval Office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/donald-trump-america-weimar\">Under Trump, America has gone a bit late Weimar. We know how that ended | Lloyd Green</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One\u2019s heart goes out to the reporters who have sifted through the Donald Trump\u2019s press briefings on the current pandemic \u2013 hour after hour of bombast, self-promotion, vitriol, lies and recklessly unscientific speculation \u2013 for any evidence of sympathy for those who are in pain. It\u2019s hardly a shock to learn that our president\u2019s expressions of care and compassion have occupied a total of less than five minutes, out of all that time.</p> <p>After all, a man who mocked a disabled journalist and boasted about grabbing women wasn\u2019t elected for the depths of his kindness and the purity of his moral conscience. And it seems unrealistically optimistic to have hoped that the extremity of this crisis should have inspired, in our leader, a deep and essential change of heart.</p> <p>Arguably, few politicians seek (and are elected to) office out of an excess of compassion. Even those who respond to catastrophe in more appropriately \u201chuman\u201d ways \u2013 George W Bush mourning the victims of 9/11, Obama tearing up at the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting \u2013 have been parochial in their sympathies; there was little ceremonial grieving for the innocent child-casualties of our bombing and drone strikes in the Middle East.</p> <p>And yet we can\u2019t help thinking how much less worried we would be if a humane, competent, well-informed adult was making the decisions that affect us all. Though we\u2019ve learned that Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned away refugees from Hitler\u2019s Europe, we can still imagine how comforting it was, for those who lived through the Great Depression, hearing his radio speeches: absorbing their message of reassurance and hope, his determination to comprehend and mitigate the sufferings of our nation.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s enraged, self-infatuated maunderings are the opposite of Roosevelt\u2019s calm resolve. Yet ultimately our president\u2019s failure of empathy is less disturbing than the ways in which it appears to resonate with his supporters. He and his allies have framed our response to the crisis in terms of partisan politics, to imply (incorrectly, as the polls suggest) that tough conservatives are eager to get back to work sooner than scaredy-cat, stay-at-home progressives.</p> <p>The flag-waving, gun-toting, defiantly unmasked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">protest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">ers storming the capitol buildings in Michigan</a> and Wisconsin would seem to support that view. This, too, is a situation that could have been defused by a president who projected sympathy, who persuaded his listeners, as Roosevelt did, that the pain of those who have lost jobs and businesses is shared by us all. Instead we see Trump\u2019s efforts to stoke rage and bitterness because he suspects that it might help solidify his base.</p> <p>It may be that the deepening polarization in our country \u2013 the suspicion, grievance and rage that the president is spouting and encouraging \u2013 is less political than spiritual. These divides go deeper than how we vote; they express our core beliefs about our responsibility to those with whom we share this brief span on this damaged planet. As Slate editor Tom Scocca posted on Twitter: \u201cConservatives have by now been conditioned to believe that thinking about other people \u2018s needs or interests in any way is tyranny by definition,\u201d a sentiment echoed by Emily Raboteau in the Huffington Post: \u201cI can\u2019t debate someone into caring about what happens to our fellow human beings.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This idea that empathy and altruism are expressions of weakness and naivety is nothing new; it\u2019s the foundation of novelist Ayn Rand\u2019s Objectivism, and it received a major boost during the Reagan-Bush years, when \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics did little to stem the growing problem of homelessness. But it\u2019s never seemed so virulent as it does today, perhaps because it has never been so openly advocated \u2013 so blatantly demonstrated \u2013 by our president. It\u2019s hard to think of anything more corrupt or corrupting than to boast about one\u2019s success when (as I write this) more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/04/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">60,000 Americans have died of Covid-19</a>. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants.</p> <p>What\u2019s most frightening to me is that the lack of empathy \u2013 the selfishness, the resentment, the hope that others will suffer even more than we are suffering \u2013 is itself a kind of virus: contagious, dangerous, possibly even lethal. I\u2019ve heard people say that the Wisconsin and Michigan protesters \u2013 shouting shoulder to shoulder, refusing to observe the simple rules of social distancing \u2013 won\u2019t learn how profoundly Trump has betrayed them until they themselves contract the virus that they have been encouraged to downplay. I\u2019ve even heard it said how unfair it is that our overweight, out-of-shape politicians \u2013 too vain to wear a mask, flouting scientific advice and the dictates of common sense \u2013 have proved immune to the disease that has felled so many decent, generous people.</p> <p>But such statements echo the absence of compassion that Trump, by tweet and by example, is encouraging us to feel. It\u2019s become another thing to resist.

  "<p>Relaying accurate information, in the normal course of events, is vital. Scrutinising government, in the normal course of events, is also vital. But these are not normal times. And our ability to carry out the functions of a news organisation is reliant on the financial resources that evidence-based reporting requires.</p> <p>However, the Guardian, alongside many businesses, has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Like many other news organisations, we are facing an unprecedented collapse in advertising revenues that further imperil the industry\u2019s sustainability.</p> <p>We rely to an ever-greater extent on our readers both for the moral force to continue doing journalism at a time like this and for the financial strength to facilitate that reporting.</p> <p>And there has never been a greater need for that reporting. At a time when science and reason should be steering public policy, we see conjecture and instinct driving the US\u2019s response. From touting untested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">hydroxychloroquine</a> to suggesting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">ingesting bleach</a>, the White House has ventilated anti-science. Drs Birx and Fauci have been all but silenced. Meanwhile, anti-vaxxers are storming state capitols and infiltrating the lockdown protests.</p> <p>Science is fighting hard to be heard but the drumbeat of economic interests is drowning it out. The Guardian, however, will continue to give science a voice so that the US public can make informed decisions based on data, not dogma. Even as coronavirus cases rise across much of the country, the president has become the cheerleader-in-chief for reopening the states. Logic dictates we do otherwise but logic and reason are in short supply. And these decisions matter. It is critical that news organisations properly invigilate government policy and show how it shapes peoples\u2019 lives \u2013 and their deaths. Without reader support, our ability to do so will be limited.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At a time like this, an independent news organisation that fights for data over dogma, and fact over fake, is essential</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In our coverage to date, we have highlighted how this pandemic is disproportionately impacting people of color \u2013 both their health and economic wellbeing.

  "<p>Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Tuesday 5 May.</p> \n<h2>Economy loses $4bn per week</h2> \n<p>In a speech to the National Press Club, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said that for every week the restrictions around Australia remain in place, Australia\u2019s economic activity reduces by $4bn.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/australian-restaurants-and-cafes-present-plans-to-come-out-of-coronavirus-shutdown\">Australian restaurants and cafes present plans to come out of coronavirus shutdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe must get people back into jobs and back into work. For every extra week the current restrictions remain in place, the Treasury estimates that we will see close to a $4bn reduction in economic activity from a combination of reduced workforce participation, productivity, and consumption.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is equivalent to what around four million Australians on the median wage would earn in a week. History shows that the longer people are unemployed, the harder it is to get a job. In the early 1990s, unemployment increased by 5% over three years, but took seven years to get back to its pre-crisis level.\u201d</p> \n<h2>ABS says one in three accommodation and food jobs gone</h2> \n<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported one in three jobs in accommodation and food industries have evaporated since the coronavirus pandemic started.</p> \n<p>More than one million people have become unemployed since mid-March, meaning Australia\u2019s unemployment rate is now at around 12.5%.</p> \n<h2>A 16th resident at Newmarch dies</h2> \n<p>Anglicare reported that a staff member at Newmarch House, a western Sydney aged care home, who was working in the Covid-19 positive area of the facility, has tested positive for the virus.</p> \n<p>New South Wales reported two other cases of coronavirus at the facility on Tuesday.

Ressler said it meant \u201chopefully they won\u2019t become unwell\u201d.</p> \n<p>Beasley revealed that a person identifying themselves as from home affairs called the NSW port authority\u2019s duty harbour master on 19 March, as did someone from the Australian Border Force.</p> \n<p>The Border Force representative discussed \u201cturning the ship around and sending it back to sea [but] shortly after, the same Australian Border Force officer rang the harbour master and may have said it could proceed\u201d.</p> \n<p>At the Canberra hearing the Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, confirmed an officer had been in touch with the harbour master.</p> \n<p>He said the officer was \u201cbeing helpful\u201d by making some inquiries internally and then sharing the assessment the agency had from NSW Health that it was low risk for the ship to disembark its passengers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell the harbour master what he or she should or shouldn\u2019t do.

  "<p>Twelve years ago, I attended a conference on public health where a leading expert on pandemics introduced his talk by saying: \u201cMy task is to tell you things you don\u2019t want to know, and ask you to spend money you haven\u2019t got on something you don\u2019t think will happen.\u201d He then went on to describe, in considerable detail, a scenario for a global pandemic that was eerily similar to the one we\u2019re currently experiencing.</p> <p>Fast-forward more than a decade, and it seems the UK government was badly prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s not as if we didn\u2019t have prior warning that an event like this was a threat. Though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/government-under-fire-failing-pandemic-recommendations\">Exercise Cygnus</a> of 2016 remains shrouded in mystery, the government\u2019s national risk register of civil emergencies has long put pandemics at the top of the list of risks the UK faces. In the 2017 register, a virus symbol sits in the top right-hand corner of a diagram of likelihood versus consequences. The UK\u2019s strategy for <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\">managing a pandemic</a>, meanwhile, was first published in 2011. But by 2014, government attention had turned away from pandemic preparation and back to counter-terrorism planning. And by 2016, planners in the UK were fully engaged in confronting the supply-chain disaster that would be Brexit, struggling to figure out how, for example, to <a href=\"https://gcrmag.com/profile/view/coffee-after-brexit\">boost the UK\u2019s coffee supply</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/100000-tests-results-coronavirus-self-isolation\">The 100,000 tests plan misses the point. It's how the results are used that matters | Paul Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain is experienced in planning for pandemics \u2013 so where is the emergency management of coronavirus? What we know so far about committees such as the scientific advisory group for emergencies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/google-executive-took-part-in-sage-meeting-coronavirus-tech-firm-confirms\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/google-executive-took-part-in-sage-meeting-coronavirus-tech-firm-confirms\">age</a>) is that they appear to include no independent advisers on emergency planning and management. Expertise in medicine, virology, epidemiology, statistics and global health are all represented. So are behavioural sciences and psychology. Yet there seems to be a prevailing sense that the coronavirus crisis is primarily a medical and epidemiological problem \u2013 and that other aspects are mere fallout.</p> <p>This is not exactly true. Modelling the transmission of the virus, researching a vaccine and procuring antiviral therapies are of course vitally important. But there is more to the coronavirus crisis than flattening its curve. The measures to contain the virus are relatively simple \u2013 physical distancing, testing, tracing and isolation \u2013 but they are laden with consequences, both for society and for individuals. Anticipating these effects and finding ways to mitigate them are the keystone of emergency planning.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis is complicated by the fact we are living in a highly interconnected world, where one event can have a ripple effect across the networks on which we all depend. Halting international travel, for example, has left food producers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/farmers-across-europe-bank-on-improvised-armies-of-pickers-to-save-harvest\">without </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/farmers-across-europe-bank-on-improvised-armies-of-pickers-to-save-harvest\">seasonal migrant</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/farmers-across-europe-bank-on-improvised-armies-of-pickers-to-save-harvest\"> workers</a> to harvest crops. But the arrival of seasonal workers from abroad in the future could lead to a second spike of infections, particularly if they live in close proximity to one another. The issue of a second spike has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/asian-countries-face-possible-second-wave-of-coronavirus-infections\">proved an issue in Singapore</a>, previously lauded for its response to the virus. These are among the types of issues that emergency planners need to consider.</p> <p>Early attempts to deal with the crisis in the UK involved minimising its significance to the public and frantically improvising in a vain attempt to catch up with the spread of the virus. If plans existed, there was an abyss between the decisions mandated by the government and the reality of how they played out on the ground. This underlines the fact that emergency planning must be a live effort. Reality does not stand still \u2013 so neither must the plans for dealing with an emergency. Planners should be able to foresee urgent needs and prioritise them, providing enough personal protective equipment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-care-home-crisis-culpable-neglect\">to the care homes that have become hotspots for the virus</a>, for example, and knowing in advance how to source such equipment in adequate quantities.</p> <p>Numerous academics have presented fairly detailed scenarios for an influenza pandemic since 2008, which covered many of the social, economic and public health consequences that we are now experiencing. But we still don\u2019t have a clear idea about the recovery process, and what actions the government should take to help society and the economy to recover. Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">we can look back to the 1918-1920 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">flu pandemic</a> for an idea of how long this recovery process might take \u2013 and the challenges that this period will present \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to apply this knowledge to the current crisis when so much has changed.</p> <p>Emergency planning isn\u2019t rocket science, but it\u2019s distinctly challenging on many levels, involving intellectual, scientific and practical decisions. Wherever an event can be foreseen, the plans should be based on a range of scenarios. Planning scenarios aren\u2019t predictions of the future but rather systematic explorations of hypothetical situations, answering the question: \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d</p> <p>When disasters strike there should be three elements to the response: plans, procedures and improvisation. We can imagine the planner as an orchestral conductor, directing the members of the orchestra to play their sheet music. It\u2019s the conductor\u2019s job to ensure the musicians play in harmony, and although improvisation can\u2019t be eliminated, it should be reduced to a bare minimum. Emergency planners will be needed to identify and meet the novel challenges that coronavirus presents \u2013 both now and in the future. Never have they been needed more on critical advisory committees.</p> <p>\u2022 David Alexander is professor of risk and disaster reduction at University<br>College London and vice-president of the Institute of Civil Protection and<br>Emergency Management</p>",
  "<p>Four miles east of Paradise, California as the crow flies, fire chief Matt McKenzie awoke in confusion at 5am on Thursday, 8 November 2018. It sounded like rain hitting the metal roof of the fire station, but there was none in the forecast.</p> <p>It took him a moment to realize that it was pine needles being flung by a strange wind \u2013 not the usual intermittent gusts he was accustomed to hearing swoosh down the canyon, but a sustained, jet-engine roar. He got up and went to the station\u2019s small kitchen, where he put the coffee on and started dicing potatoes and onions for his crew\u2019s breakfast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=true&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff9b878fa06fdbec1cf96039acd01b5da77f4a6d7%3Fcrop%3D0_0_434_638&amp;title=Fire%20in%20Paradise%3A%20An%20American%20Tragedy&amp;author=Alastair%20Gee%20and%20Dani%20Anguiano&amp;publisher=WW%20Norton&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffireinparadisebook.com%2F\" data-alt=\"Book\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&is-extract=true&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff9b878fa06fdbec1cf96039acd01b5da77f4a6d7%3Fcrop%3D0_0_434_638&title=Fire%20in%20Paradise%3A%20An%20American%20Tragedy&author=Alastair%20Gee%20and%20Dani%20Anguiano&publisher=WW%20Norton&link=http%3A%2F%2Ffireinparadisebook.com%2F\">Book</a> </figure>  <p>A 20-year veteran of Cal Fire, California\u2019s state firefighting force, McKenzie had never rested easy at Jarbo Gap. Its location alone was enough to quicken the heart. The station was atop a high ridge overlooking the canyon in which a branch of the Feather River flowed southward, at about the point the canyon and the river make an abrupt, 90-degree turn to the east. Winds streaming down the canyon would run straight into this turn and spill out, moaning over the top of the station, especially at night, when canyon winds commonly pick up. Fires in the region often start in this steep and inaccessible declivity, served by a single main road that meanders alongside the water.</p> <p>At 6.15am, the electric company PG&amp;E experienced a power outage on a high-voltage line that traversed the canyon. Only one customer was affected \u2013 a hydroelectric station located in the canyon that was operated by a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area. At about 6.28am, a PG&amp;E supervisor driving through the canyon six miles north of Jarbo Gap saw a fire that he estimated to measure 100 sq ft in a clearing below the transmission line, and radioed a nearby company facility, which conveyed the alert to emergency services.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"153f88e6540a429d419f85684c454fcb3a267f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/153f88e6540a429d419f85684c454fcb3a267f3e/0_159_4857_2914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Power lines in Pulga, California, 8 November 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power lines in Pulga on 8 November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the first warning of what would become the deadliest US wildfire in a century, claiming 85 lives and ravaging an entire town. Sparked in a region desiccated by drought, a few hours north of San Francisco, it would also be a harbinger of how the climate crisis is transforming the natural world.</p> <p>Before long, McKenzie\u2019s phone lit up with a text informing him of an ignition. He opened the back door to the kitchen and the wind ripped it right out of his hands. Although he expected to catch the smell of the fire, all he got was the dry pines. He and five other firefighters headed into the canyon in the dark in two trucks. It was a place McKenzie had known his entire life \u2013 as a kid growing up in the nearby town of Oroville, he would come up here with his dad to hunt, fish, or log a Christmas tree in the high, green solitude. It took them about fifteen minutes to reach the fire, going as fast as they could while keeping the engines on the road and avoiding nosediving into the canyon. As soon as they got there, McKenzie was dismayed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/we-created-the-anthropocene-and-the-anthropocene-is-biting-back\">We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The flames \u2013 sheltered and low to the ground, a dusky orange \u2013 were on the wrong side of the river. McKenzie had been hoping that they would be on the canyon\u2019s east side, where they would be accessible from the two-lane highway he was on. Instead they were west of the river, off a dirt track called Camp Creek Road. It was an impossible location. Camp Creek Road was hewn roughly into the side of the valley and in some places had been washed out by floods. It was so narrow that a fire truck could pull in its wing mirrors and still probably scrape the rock outcroppings. It could take another forty minutes just to carefully creep down to the blaze, and once they reached it there would be nowhere to turn around, meaning the truck would have to reverse out. That would be agonizingly difficult under any circumstances, but especially in the face of flames being wind-whipped toward them.</p> <p>It was a situation in which McKenzie would want to call in aircraft to drop water or retardant, but he knew that wasn\u2019t an option: it was too dark and the wind too savage. \u201cIt was so close to a highway yet so far away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was taunting \u2013 you see it, look at it, and it\u2019s right there, and you can\u2019t do a frigging thing about it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It looked to Matt McKenzie like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Camp Creek Road may have defied fire crews, but it did lend the blaze its incongruously playful name: the Camp fire. Analyzing from the highway, McKenzie thought the wind was behaving unusually. Typically it blows south, toward his station. This time it was blowing west, as if trying to push the fire up the wall of the river valley, in the direction of the small community of Concow and, beyond it, Paradise.<strong> </strong>This was why he had been unable to catch its smell earlier.</p> <p>It looked to him like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at. But there were only a fraction of that number in the county. He radioed the incident command team in Oroville, the county seat, and requested fifteen additional engines and four bulldozers. His hope was that they would catch the fire once it topped the slope it seemed to want to crest.</p> <h2>Escaping with dogs and a cat</h2> <p>The community of Concow centers on Concow Reservoir, which presents as an alpine lagoon fringed with tule reeds and piney mountains. The valley is a dimple in the gnarly uplands that separate Paradise and Jarbo Gap, and despite its relative proximity of only a couple miles to both, the circuitous roads mean that it takes 45 minutes to drive to the former and 25 minutes to the latter. People moved here to work the land and for the sun-speckled, dirt-road lifestyle. In the early 1970s, Concow\u2019s population of loggers, homesteaders, and retirees was supplemented by hippie types looking for a more sustainable kind of existence, inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog, Wendell Berry, and the back to the land movement.</p> <p>A former firefighter who lived in Concow named Scott Carlin had been doing his best to shut his mind off when he overheard a transmission from Jarbo Gap firefighters at the scene of the fire. Severe insomnia meant Carlin could go three or four days without sleeping, and that night, for the first time in years, he was forced to forgo his usual Ambien pill because he had been unable to fill his prescription. He lay oppressively awake on the living-room couch in a house west of the lake as his wife, Renee Carlin, a nurse at both an ER and a jail, and their two sons, Michael and Cody, dozed peacefully.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5171d44ca4694dda849fd368bdb2acaa16248095\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5171d44ca4694dda849fd368bdb2acaa16248095/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Concow reservoir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Concow reservoir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Renee Carlin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carlin kept several of his old helmets on the wall, including the one he\u2019d worn on a callout 20 years before, which almost became his last. He had been searching a burning mobile home for its occupant when a fireball exploded through it; he hit the floor, inches below the boiling maelstrom, and only got out because a colleague was groping for him through the doorway. Now he was a stay-at-home dad taking care of the property and of Cody, a sweet boy who had autism and needed ferrying to special classes and therapists. But it was hard for Carlin to shake the fire bug, which explained the radio scanners tuned to emergency frequencies on a desk just over his shoulder.</p> <p>The message said the fire in Concow could be dangerous, but Carlin was cautious: was it really the case, or was the firefighter just green? When a second transmission confirmed the risk, Carlin roused his wife and sons, and they started throwing belongings in suitcases.<strong> </strong>Outside he tried to clear flammable brush away from the house with his little tractor, but it didn\u2019t have much effect. Another radio message said that a home nearby had caught fire, and Carlin ran five minutes down a dirt footpath through the ponderosas, to the lakeside home of his wife\u2019s parents, to tell them to get out. He jogged back to his own house, and then, for good measure, went back to his in-laws one more time to make sure they had left. Carlin joked that his mother-in-law, a retired teacher, did not operate on any schedule but her own. To his relief, they had gone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a41d6d21ba1305aca4a2a20f28d39a26347841ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a41d6d21ba1305aca4a2a20f28d39a26347841ae/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott and Renee Carlin with their grandson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott and Renee Carlin with their grandson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Renee Carlin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the radio, Carlin heard that the main road out of the valley was blocked. Having planned to escape this way, he was forced to change his course. Immediately he thought of the one place he knew would be free of fire. Carrying their cases \u2013 with their cat in a cage and their two dogs on leashes \u2013 Renee and the kids hurried through the smoky woods, past her parents\u2019 house and toward the lakeshore. Cody had been afraid of dogs since a family pet had jumped on him and knocked him over when he was little. Renee told him he would just have to take one. Michael dashed to see if their aged neighbor, whom they only knew as Bruno, had left, and returned with Bruno\u2019s arm around his shoulder, half carrying, half dragging him down the hill.</p> <p>In no time at all they were engulfed. Flames were licking the edge of the lake, and the family edged out up to their knees in the muddy tule reeds. Bruno\u2019s foot got stuck and he fell on his back. Fragile at the best of times, he seemed to give up. <em>Just go</em>, he told Carlin. <em>Leave me alone</em>. When Carlin went to pull him up, Bruno refused to give him his arm. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that,\u201d Carlin said. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you, I\u2019m not gonna burn, so you\u2019d better get your butt up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff42976ec5aeef89c911c7c6d8e943438ca782aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff42976ec5aeef89c911c7c6d8e943438ca782aa/0_0_5104_3401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames from the Camp fire burn near a home atop a ridge near Big Bend, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flames from the Camp fire burn near a home atop a ridge near Big Bend, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unexpectedly, the reeds began to catch fire, and they had to edge deeper into the lake. Renee and her sons were quickly up to their necks or treading water. Cody had the cat in a cage on his shoulder, and the mewling animal was half-submerged. It was early November in the mountains, and the water was so painfully cold it took Renee\u2019s breath away. She thought her heart might stop. Carlin, still in the reeds with Bruno, couldn\u2019t see her in the smoke.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not leaving you, I\u2019m not gonna burn, so you\u2019d better get your butt up</p> <footer> <cite>Scott Carlin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Swim to the island, he shouted to them. By island he meant a peninsula sticking out from the opposite side, about 350ft away. Cody stayed behind, but she and Michael kicked out in the frigid water, and in the half-light, Renee could see the shore around her wreathed in smoke, and orange flashes of flame. The husky she was holding got loose and swam back to Scott. The border collie, panicking, tried to climb on top of her and threatened to push her under, and she screamed.</p> <p>Yet the wind was so strong that despite propelling themselves in one direction they were pushed in another, down-shore of where they had launched out. It was a lucky mishap \u2013 Michael found two rowboats, each with a paddle inside, tied with a cable to a stump. He tried to wrench the cable apart, but it wouldn\u2019t give, so he smashed the wooden post. Waterlogged and rotten, it splintered. Paddling themselves back to Carlin, they tried to coax Bruno aboard, but he flatly refused to get in. He simply couldn\u2019t do it, he said. So with one hand Michael steadied a boat, and with the other he lifted Bruno onto the craft. Under the weight of four people and the dogs the boats were only two or three inches above the water, and Carlin told them to go without him. He would find them later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1eee84962029128e592fdd9265e7ce116d0d3086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eee84962029128e592fdd9265e7ce116d0d3086/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighters work to contain the Camp fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefighters work to contain the Camp fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dasilva/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They struck out, and this time they did end up on the peninsula. Soaking wet, they were freezing despite the occasional hot gust from across the lake, and they hid behind a rocky outcropping to try to keep out of the wind. Bruno\u2019s ability to make sense of the situation was going, and he seemed not to remember what was happening. Renee\u2019s legs were so cold that she couldn\u2019t walk. Michael went to find help, hollering in case someone could hear him. In the distance there was a response to his cry.</p> <h2>\u2018The fire is now in Paradise\u2019</h2> <p>On lots hidden by screens of trees across the valley, long-timers fired up their tractors or chainsaws and began clearing flammable brush from around their properties, to create a swathe of defensible space. Others jumped into their cars and poured out onto bad roads on which visibility was rapidly diminishing. They witnessed things that defied all logic and experience.</p> <p>Looking across the road to her neighbor\u2019s property, just a few hundred feet away, one woman, a British transplant named Joanna Curtin, saw a bulging whirlwind of flame and smoke that was sucking debris from the ground, setting it alight, and rocketing it into the sky. It was a fire tornado as wide as a pickup truck, and it was moving slowly but inexorably toward her.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounded like a freight train going around. It sounded \u2026 it had this other sound too, more evil,\u201d she said. \u201cOh God, I can\u2019t even imagine what I could describe it as close to,\u201d she added. \u201cThere was nothing earthly about it.\u201d It was spinning and \u201cthrowing big pieces of wood on fire,\u201d three to four feet in length.

  "<p>Leaders in Australia and New Zealand have floated the idea of a trans-Tasman bubble for some weeks now, as cases of coronavirus in both countries continue to drop, nearly in tandem.</p> \n<h2>Why is it being raised now?</h2> \n<p>The arrangement is principally motivated by economic necessity as both countries\u2019 economies tank under tight lockdown restrictions, and recessions loom. Opening the borders would allow significant trade to resume (nearly 19,000 Australian businesses trade with New Zealand), as well as \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 tens of thousands of visitors each way.

With New Zealand potentially moving to level 2 restrictions next week, and the New Zealand ski season opening just a month away, it is not impossible that borders could be open by early winter \u2013 as long as Australia is able to match New Zealand\u2019s progress, which now stands at zero cases nationwide for two days. However, both prime ministers have refused to commit to a timetable, and Scott Morrison has ruled out anything as soon as \u201cnext week\u201d, saying significant domestic travel would need to be under way \u2013 such as between Melbourne to Cairns \u2013 before New Zealand was welcomed into the fold.

Lovers of La Serenissima at its less-touristy will like this story that unfolds in grim February weather, with <em>acqua alta </em>(floods) in the city (as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/13/waves-in-st-marks-square-as-venice-flooded-highest-tide-in-50-years\">happened last autumn</a>).

  "<p>Were his twin 13-year-old daughters not studiously home-schooling themselves, or his twentysomething son not living at home, Vic Reeves might not have noticed the lockdown. Life, he says, has not really changed. Every day, as he always does, he gets up at 6am, has breakfast, then goes into his studio to paint, emerging around 4pm. \u201cWe don\u2019t really go out much,\u201d he says on the phone from his home in a Kent village.</p> <p>He is planning his next painting, a \u201cstill life\u201d featuring a Renault 4, the German electronic band Kraftwerk, a goldfinch and a pineapple. \u201cI love pineapple,\u201d he says in his soothing north-east accent. \u201cYou know, pineapple\u2019s great on ham, and just on its own, and in a drink.\u201d The slightest, perfect pause. \u201cIt\u2019s a very versatile fruit.\u201d </p> <p>I don\u2019t know what to call him. He is famous as Vic Reeves, from his gloriously nonsensical and anarchic comedy shows. His mum calls him Rod (his middle name). In the 80s, he would introduce himself at parties as Jim Bell, one of his many stage characters. His wife, Nancy, and his comedy partner, Bob Mortimer, call him Jim \u2013 his real name is Jim Moir, which is what he wanted to be billed as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2018/mar/06/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month\">The Big Flower Fight</a>, the new reality show he presents. But despite his efforts over the years to escape Reeves, it has not happened. Reeves it is.</p> <p>The Big Flower Fight is Netflix\u2019s answer to the well-worn format of taking a wholesome hobby and making a gruelling competition of it. This is not flower arranging, but giant floral living installations \u2013 in the first episode, the 10 creative couples make giant insects decorated with a whole nursery of plants. There is a lot of chicken wire and moss. The winning team will have a sculpture installed at Kew Gardens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9341a29ee1497d045e3abba14d3af4625a20d956\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9341a29ee1497d045e3abba14d3af4625a20d956/0_0_2800_1982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Reeves with Bob Mortimer in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re the most unargumentative people ever\u2019 ...

He thinks of this as a show about art, rather than gardening. \u201cI love seeing people create,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s watching people who are passionate about making, and there is a lot of drama in there as well. I\u2019m not saying a punch-up, but there were words said.\u201d This is not about making a bunch of delphiniums look nice in a vase. \u201cYou\u2019ve got big metal frames and welding. Then the beauty that comes out at the end of it, it\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s quite brutal at times. Things go wrong. When things collapse, it\u2019s heartbreaking, but great drama.\u201d He laughs, delighted. Did he ever see himself presenting a reality show? \u201cI mean, it\u2019s really easy. If you\u2019re really into it, which I was, then you just get excited about it.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves, 61, seems to be part endearingly grumpy old man and part childish buffoon. He doesn\u2019t have a computer or do email. \u201cA few years ago, I started sending postcards to people, because I thought it was quite a good thing to do. And I got texts back from people, which is awful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d But the other day he was \u201ctrying desperately\u201d to do a handstand (and failing: \u201cI think that\u2019s probably more to do with the immense bulk that I\u2019ve accrued over the years\u201d).</p> <p>Reeves and Mortimer brought their surrealist comedy to TV with Vic Reeves Big Night Out, which started on Channel 4 in 1990. Through a variety show of sketches, songs and general weirdness, it introduced Reeves, \u201cBritain\u2019s top light entertainer\u201d, to the nation, along with Mortimer and their lab-coat-wearing sidekick, Les. They moved to the BBC in 1993 with The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer \u2013 the bigger budget meant less of the shambolic DIY charm, but even more bewildering insights into their imaginations \u2013 and then, in 1995, the spoof panel show Shooting Stars.</p> <p>Their work was unlike anything else (unless you had been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/aug/24/why-vic-reeves-is-the-strangest-most-perfect-presenter-for-bbc4s-dada-season\">dada</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/aug/24/why-vic-reeves-is-the-strangest-most-perfect-presenter-for-bbc4s-dada-season\">ist hanging around the Cabaret Voltaire in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/aug/24/why-vic-reeves-is-the-strangest-most-perfect-presenter-for-bbc4s-dada-season\">1910s Zurich</a>). This was partly because Reeves didn\u2019t watch any of his comic peers: \u201cThat\u2019s what made it unique, because you do it from a totally naive point of view.\u201d He grew up in Darlington, on the outskirts of the town \u2013 his childhood was spent running around the fields and collecting birds\u2019 eggs. His first double act was formed at school with another boy named Rod. \u201cWe created our own comedy. As far as I remember, we made it up. I didn\u2019t really watch TV, so there was no influence. I like attacking subjects without any prior knowledge of anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec0a3298f9e0f11cf15bf0b2079830424e24f984\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec0a3298f9e0f11cf15bf0b2079830424e24f984/0_0_2851_2990/954.jpg\" alt=\"Self Portrait With Bigfoot by Vic Reeves\" width=\"954\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My paintings exist in half-sleep\u2019 ...

Did they never sit around together and watch TV? \u201cSaturday-night entertainment then was as awful as it is now,\u201d he says with a laugh. After school, Reeves started a mechanical engineering apprenticeship at a factory. He wrote in his autobiography (volume one \u2013 he says he keeps meaning to do volume two) that the older men there \u201clooked like they were slipping into a kind of boredom-induced madness\u201d.</p> <p>Reeves left in the 80s, moved to London and started running clubs in pubs and bars: one was a classical music club, \u201cwhich was a terrible failure\u201d; another, in the West End, seemed to consist of celebrities doing egg and spoon races (he remembers Boy George taking part). When a friend asked if he wanted to take over his comedy club, Reeves agreed. Instead of booking the acts, he thought he would perform himself, \u201cto see if I could get away with it\u201d. Does he remember the first show he did? \u201cI had a cardboard box with a picture of Sylvester Stallone taped to the front of it.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt was really like a performance piece.\u201d</p> <p>It was here that the character Vic Reeves emerged. \u201cI think my idea was that I was going to play a sort of northern working men\u2019s club compere, that kind of thing. I thought a good name was Vic Reeves, which was like Vic Feather, the union boss then [he was general secretary of the TUC from 1969 to 1973].\u201d Within weeks, Jools Holland had spotted him and got him on his TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/15/how-we-made-the-tube-80s-tv-pop-show\">The Tube</a>. He moved to a bigger venue \u2013 the Goldsmith\u2019s Tavern in New Cross, south London \u2013 which is where he met Mortimer, then a solicitor, who had come to see the show. \u201cIt was kind of like a free-for-all, so I roped Bob into doing stuff there.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves and Mortimer were part of the comedy explosion in the 90s. \u201cThe phrase was \u2018Comedy is the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019, and we were always on the front cover of the NME,\u201d says Reeves (they were on the cover twice and featured in the magazine regularly). \u201cBecause we referenced modern pop culture, we were the indie kids\u2019 favourite.\u201d They even became pop stars themselves: Reeves\u2019 version of Tommy Roe\u2019s Dizzy, recorded with the Wonder Stuff, got to No 1, while Reeves and Mortimer (and EMF) hit No 3 with a cover of the Monkees\u2019 I\u2019m a Believer. On tour, he says, \u201cyou\u2019d be in a hotel, like in Liverpool, and outside the hotel there\u2019s about 300 kids all shouting and screaming\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c53e06b4e93957ec454a293db13d448edb15816c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c53e06b4e93957ec454a293db13d448edb15816c/0_0_4016_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Reeves as Colin Callin in Coronation Street, opposite Barbara Knox as Rita Tanner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soap star ...

Was there drink? Drugs? \u201cOh yeah. All that,\u201d he says. He would smoke weed, but it was mostly drinking. \u201cLager, that was our main vice. Lager and fags, very working class.\u201d Is it true they took a gun on tour (Mortimer told the comedian Richard Herring this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwyUf0OlBsM\">when he appeared on his podcast</a>)? \u201cYeah, we did. It just had blanks in it, but we used to \u2026\u201d He breaks off in laughter. Whenever they crossed a border (or sometimes a county line), \u201cwe\u2019d fire a pistol off. When we went to Scotland, it got fired off a few times.\u201d Why? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Firing a pistol with blanks in is good fun.\u201d The gun came from a military fair, he thinks.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to get dynamite as well. I don\u2019t know where that came from. I remember we had an office with Jools Holland in Greenwich and we set off a rocket. It flew off, went haywire and went in through Billy Idol\u2019s dad\u2019s bathroom window.\u201d The combination of events is so strange, so Reeves, that I don\u2019t know if he is making it up. But we both laugh.</p> <p>Did their antics \u2013 the drinking, the tomfoolery \u2013 ever get out of hand? \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t got it in me to drink that much,\u201d he says. Reeves and Mortimer went back on tour a couple of years ago and barely drank at all. \u201cIn the 90s, you\u2019d have a drink and then the next day you\u2019d feel awful and then you\u2019d have a drink to make yourself feel better. It was quite depressing, really. You get older and it\u2019s brilliant \u2013 you go: \u2018Let\u2019s go and have a detour to this pork pie shop.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He has watched comedians become superstars and sell out arena tours, but he has not felt envious. \u201cThere are two things about people who do arenas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like the money and they like the adoration. And Bob and I are neither of those people.\u201d They did an arena show in Leeds \u201cand I thought: we\u2019re really not in touch with anyone here\u201d, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f56da685378597dd76487000de353251c84f76cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f56da685378597dd76487000de353251c84f76cf/0_0_4242_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mortimer and Reeves on the revamped Big Night Out, which returned in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Vic and Bob are pretty stupid\u2019 ...

Is that right? \u201cWe both are,\u201d he says. If you went in for pop psychology, you might suggest Reeves \u2013 the brash ringmaster of anarchy \u2013 was a bit of an outlet for its quieter creator, but Reeves disagrees. \u201cVic Reeves is not a character I would like to be like. He started off as a kind of boastful northern club compere and then ended up as a really gormless idiot. Vic and Bob are pretty stupid; Vic is slightly more stupid than Bob.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves\u2019s thigh-rubbing in the direction of female guests on Shooting Stars was always meant to be uncomfortable, but these days it looks unconscionable. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it means. I think it was kind of lasciviously anticipating something.\u201d </p> <p>When he appeared on Celebrity MasterChef in 2017, many people on social media were incredulous that Vic Reeves was not his real name. \u201cSome people do think that that is actually me doing Shooting Stars and Big Night Out and that\u2019s what I\u2019m like,\u201d he says. How much of his personality is in Reeves? \u201cAbsolutely none. He\u2019s the anti of what I am.\u201d</p> <p>His and Mortimer\u2019s double act has survived, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s completely democratic. If one idea is suggested and falls upon silence, it\u2019s brushed to one side without any regrets.\u201d They have never fallen out. \u201cWe\u2019re the most unargumentative people ever.\u201d They are supposed to be making a film together in October, something they wrote about 10 years ago about Michael Jackson\u2019s white glove, \u201cwhich is the holy grail for collectors. It\u2019s like in search of the holy grail, but we know where it is and we have to get it. It\u2019s all about celebrity memorabilia as a religion.\u201d </p> <p>Reeves has taken acting jobs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39998350\">he was in Coronation Street</a>, which he never misses, for a few months \u2013 but he says he never had any ambition to become a solo comic. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ever stand up in front of an audience on my own and talk to them. It would be awful; I couldn\u2019t bear to do it.\u201d His voice rises. \u201cIt looks terrifying. With Bob and me, we just act out little plays.\u201d</p> <p>He still doesn\u2019t follow comedy, nor the politics around it \u2013 such as the idea that there are some things you shouldn\u2019t joke about. \u201cWhen people say you can and can\u2019t say things, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s the authority on it,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re kind, as long as you\u2019re not upsetting anyone. But that\u2019s a natural thing, isn\u2019t it? I would never do anything if I thought it was going to upset anyone.\u201d</p> <p>He wants to get back to his painting. The one with the pineapple came to him when he was in a dream-like state. \u201cI wake up in the morning with a new idea \u2013 that\u2019s how my paintings exist, really, in half-sleep.\u201d It sounds amazing, I say. \u201cIt is!\u201d he replies, sounding delighted.</p> <p><em>The Big Flower Fight will be available on Netflix on 18 May.</em></p>",
