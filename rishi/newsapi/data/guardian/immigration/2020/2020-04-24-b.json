  "<p>Detailed century-old observations of penguin behaviour, including sexual activity so depraved and shocking it was recorded in Greek alphabet code, have been acquired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/natural-history-museum\">Natural History Museum</a>.</p> <p>Curators at the museum announced the purchase of original manuscript notebooks made by the explorer George Murray Levick, part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/jan/17/south-pole-robert-scott-exploration-centenary\">Robert Falcon Scott\u2019s ill-fated Terra Nova expedition to the Antarctic</a> in 1910-13.</p> <p>As well as insights in to the unstoppable sex lives of penguins, they shine light on a remarkable story of survival and endurance with Levick forced to live in a cramped ice cave for seven months after he was unable to re-embark on the Terra Nova in February 1912.</p> <p>Douglas Russell, a senior curator of birds at the Natural History Museum, said the handwritten notes were a unique account of huge historical and zoological research interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cba303db7ed14675c542417a4b6b895b8af5c10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cba303db7ed14675c542417a4b6b895b8af5c10/45_197_2704_1623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Levick\u2019s notebooks, from observations of an Ad\u00e9lie penguin colony, include the birds\u2019 shocking sexual behaviour recorded in code.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Levick\u2019s notebooks, from observations of an Ad\u00e9lie penguin colony, include the birds\u2019 shocking sexual behaviour recorded in code.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NHM London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Together the notes represent the first major observations of an entire breeding season of an Ad\u00e9lie penguin colony.</p> <p>They are an exciting and important acquisition, Russell said. \u201cMaterial such as this is often unavailable to researchers and now, for the first time, modern science has the opportunity to study Levick\u2019s first-hand account and revisit his conclusions.</p> <p>\u201cThe importance of original manuscripts cannot be underestimated as they add crucial contextual and scientific data to our existing collections.\u201d</p> <p>Levick was a young surgeon on Scott\u2019s Terra Nova expedition to the South Pole and was entrusted with documenting the area\u2019s natural history. \u201cHe is a hugely positive soul,\u201d said Russell. \u201cHe is a nice chap.</p> <p>\u201cHe becomes completely obsessed with the Ad\u00e9lie penguin colony. One of the greatest joys in reading the notebooks is that, when the first birds arrive, you can tell the mounting excitement that he has. It is palpable in the pages \u2026 it blows his mind.\u201d</p> <p>Levick was shocked by elements of penguin behaviour, documenting the excesses of young males, or \u201chooligan cocks\u201d, in Greek alphabet code. These include necrophilia, sexual abuse of chicks, non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour.</p> <p>But that\u2019s penguins for you. \u201cThe thing with penguins is that sperm is cheap,\u201d said Russell. \u201cThey have one over-riding aim which is to fertilise and bring on the next generation \u2026 the birds will pretty much have sex with anything.\u201d</p> <p>The notebooks are particularly important because the area Levick was studying, Ridley Beach on Cape Adare, is still home to around 335,000 Ad\u00e9lie penguins, the largest colony in the world. But, <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.172032\">scientists predict, not for much longer</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAs we see rising sea levels, it is highly likely that the entire colony will move. Part of the value here is that this is an account of an area that will one day be lost, it will all be reclaimed by the sea.</p> <p>\u201cAs a scientist, Levick was decades ahead of his time and now, more than 100 years later, his words still have much to tell us,\u201d said Russell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"190ed2590083bf8e2826cd3c7a60ba93dbaebc2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/190ed2590083bf8e2826cd3c7a60ba93dbaebc2c/0_261_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Levick during his stay on Cape Adare, Antarctica, with the Terra Nova expedition from which he later survived being marooned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Levick during his stay on Cape Adare, Antarctica, with the Terra Nova expedition from which he later survived being marooned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antarctic Heritage Trust (nz)/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The survival of the notebooks is all the more remarkable because of what Levick and five others endured after their time on Cape Adare when they were unable, after the death of Scott, to re-embark on the Terra Nova.</p> <p>Effectively marooned, they were forced to make an ice cave where they lived for seven months surviving on blubber and birds they had killed. After living in \u201cutterly horrendous\u201d conditions, Levick then walked 200 miles back to home camp.</p> <p>\u201cHis ability to weather this storm is extraordinary,\u201d said Russell. \u201cI do think there is a massive parallel for us all in that whatever we think of as isolation, we are nowhere near what Levick went through. Maybe it gives us the ability to look at things in context.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement was made to coincide with <a href=\"https://www.asoc.org/advocacy/antarctic-wildlife-conservation/penguins/1189\">world penguin day</a>. The museum plans to make the notebooks physically and digitally available for future research, outreach and education</p> <p>Andrea Hart, head of special collections at the museum, said: \u201cThe Levick notebooks are a vital addition to our existing collection and the scientific observations held in original manuscripts such as these remain as relevant and important today as when they were first created.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re delighted that Levick\u2019s work can now be accessed by academics, researchers and the public, more than a century after his seminal trip to Antarctica.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Gary Lineker is talking to Alphonso Davies on Zoom about the Bayern Munich player\u2019s role as a supporter of the UN Refugee Agency\u2019s Covid-19 response when the youngster\u2019s mobile rings. Davies leans forwards to pick it up and stares at it for a moment before turning it off and apologising. \u201cWas that Robert Lewandowski?\u201d Lineker jokes. Davies grins, explaining it was his German teacher, reminding him of their virtual lesson later in the day.</p> \n<p>Davies is only 19 years old but one of the most exciting prospects in world football. He joined Bayern from Vancouver Whitecaps in January 2019 in a deal worth \u00a39m, a record for an MLS player at the time. The left-back made six substitute appearances in the second half of the 2018-19 season but has exploded into life this campaign.</p> \n<p>In February he mesmerised a world audience as Bayern took Chelsea apart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/25/chelsea-bayern-munich-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\">and won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge</a> in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garylineker/status/1232419942689054722?lang=en\">prompting Lineker to tweet</a>: \u201cAlphonso Davies\u2019 parents fled Liberia in the civil war. He was born in a refugee camp in Ghana and moved to Canada when he was five. Here he is playing beautifully for Bayern at 19. What a wonderful story.\u201d </p> \n<p>Davies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/canadas-alphonso-davies-signs-new-bayern-munich-contract-until-2025\">who extended his </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/canadas-alphonso-davies-signs-new-bayern-munich-contract-until-2025\">contract with Bayern this week</a>, is widely liked for his amiable personality and refusal to take himself too seriously, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@alphonsodavies?lang=en\">his daft TikTok videos</a>. Yet he is dedicated in his support of refugees, working closely with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) as a high-profile supporter. On Saturday, Davies will play three live-streamed matches in a Pro Evolution Soccer tournament against Milan\u2019s on-loan goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, a former refugee himself, to raise funds for UNHCR\u2019s Covid-19 response. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Refugees/status/1253665996650369029\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sports presenter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GaryLineker</a> meets the inspiring <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FCBayern?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FCBayern</a> player <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlphonsoDavies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AlphonsoDavies</a>, who is taking the football world by storm. \u26a1\u26bd <a href=\"https://t.co/r5w8UOULJa\">pic.twitter.com/r5w8UOULJa</a></p>\u2014 UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency (@Refugees) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Refugees/status/1253665996650369029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 24, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Gary Lineker</strong> Alphonso, it\u2019s lovely to sort of meet you, even though it\u2019s in these circumstances. First of all, how are you doing in isolation?</p> \n<p><strong>Alphonso Davies</strong> Yeah, I\u2019m good. The team started training a couple of weeks ago so I\u2019m happy for that. But it\u2019s a tough situation right now, so I guess we just have to play our part and stay inside.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all get back to playing football once again. You have obviously had some hardships in your life, particularly growing up as a refugee. Do you remember your formative years in the Buduburam refugee camp?</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> I can\u2019t really remember too much about those years. I wish I could. I can\u2019t even really remember kicking a football around, although I know I did. It\u2019s not a memory they want to share with their kids too often, but they talked about it a little bit because it\u2019s part of our story.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> Do you ever feel the urge to go back to Ghana or Liberia?</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> I asked my parents about it because we still have family in both countries but the way things are going right now I will have to wait a little bit longer.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> Things have gone amazingly well for you since your family moved to Canada, but it must have been a massive step for them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af09b08ac01a114b6f0b591b9da7337a10f62daa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af09b08ac01a114b6f0b591b9da7337a10f62daa/0_0_2363_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alphonso Davies celebrates scoring for Vancouver Whitecaps against Minnesota United in July 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alphonso Davies celebrates scoring for Vancouver Whitecaps against Minnesota United in July 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Marie Sorvin/USA Today Sports</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Davies </strong>Yeah it was tough, but it was also an amazing feeling \u2013 being able to go to a country and do what you want to do, be who you want to be. I think my family did well. I\u2019m very proud of them.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> And you finally had the chance to go to school, which should be an important part of any child\u2019s life.</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> Exactly. I enjoyed every moment of being at school. Football doesn\u2019t last for ever, so you need an education longer term.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> When did you start to realise that you were quite good at this game?</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> [Laughs] Not until I moved to Vancouver in 2016 and joined the Whitecaps\u2019 academy team. Whenever I watched the first team, I thought: \u201cThis is where I want to be. This is my dream.\u201d I always did my best in training and on the field and now I\u2019m playing for one of the best teams in the world. </p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> You were just 14 when you left home and moved to Vancouver. I heard that your mother was particularly worried that you might go astray and become a bad boy.</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> [Laughs] Yeah, that was her number one worry! She obviously wasn\u2019t there with me and so nobody was telling me what to do. But there\u2019s a policy at the Whitecaps where you have to maintain a grade average to be able to train and play in the academy, and if they see your grades are slipping up, they might even take you out of the academy. They took care of me.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> Who did you support when you were younger?</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> My dad is a Chelsea fan.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> Really? And look at what you just did to Chelsea!</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> Exactly! My dad really liked Didier Drogba and there was always a Chelsea game on when I was growing up. There were so many amazing teams to watch but I didn\u2019t particularly have a team. So it was Chelsea by force.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> You were just 15 when you made your Major League Soccer debut for Whitecaps and, in 2017, after receiving Canadian citizenship, you became the youngest player to appear for the Canadian men\u2019s team. Then, in 2018, when you were 18, you were Canada\u2019s men\u2019s player of the year. You must have been incredibly proud.</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> It makes me feel like all the hard work I\u2019ve been doing over the years is really paying off. The coach saw something in me when I became a citizen of Canada and he took me to the national team camp\u2026 Being men\u2019s player of the year was a shock!</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63f5f724398b4ed7e4ae052c58bfd1cb701cde8a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f5f724398b4ed7e4ae052c58bfd1cb701cde8a/65_523_6125_3675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alphonso Davies posing for a photo with the Bayern Munich officials Oliver Kahn, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Hasan Salihamidzic after signing a new contract this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alphonso Davies (third from left) posing for a photo with the Bayern Munich officials Oliver Kahn, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Hasan Salihamidzic after signing a new contract this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M Donato/FC Bayern via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> And, of course, in January 2019 you moved to Bayern Munich. How did that come about? I think a lot of European clubs, including Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, were looking at you at the time.</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> There were rumours in the air that all these different clubs were looking at me but I didn\u2019t know which specific clubs. No one told me anything. And then I got a message: \u201cBayern Munich want to meet you.\u201d I was like: \u201cOh my god. Really?\u201d It was both exciting and scary. I just had to prove to myself that I could compete at this level.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> What was it like on the first day? Was it intimidating meeting all the superstar Bayern players like Lewandowski and Neuer?</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> Yes! I\u2019d watched these guys on TV since I was a kid and there I was, seeing them in person, training with them and playing with them. I was <em>very</em> intimidated. When Arjen Robben introduced himself to me, I just couldn\u2019t believe it.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> Do you think your previous experiences in life, as a refugee and then moving from Edmonton to Vancouver as a boy, helped ease your move to Germany?</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> I think so. Those moves definitely prepared me for moving overseas. If I hadn\u2019t already made those moves, I\u2019d be very homesick every single day. I am still homesick but I can deal with it.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> We live in such challenging times. You are a supporter of UNHCR. Did you want to give something back perhaps?</p> \n<p><strong>Davies</strong> I want to use my platform to talk about refugees and my personal story to inspire people to reach out and help. It\u2019s so hard for people in refugee camps to do any kind of social distancing. They need clean water, soap to wash their hands and food.</p> \n<p><strong>Lineker</strong> I\u2019ve seen some of your videos on TikTok and you\u2019re quite the personality on there aren\u2019t you? Singing, dancing, all sorts \u2026</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1224606286324563968\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bayern Munich.

Data has to be robust, recording of ethnicity both by country of origin or ethnic group is hugely complex. The death certificate might give country of origin, for example, but this does not tell us anything about cultural background, community and lifestyle, she says.</p> \n  <p>She says it is still \u201cpotentially\u201d an issue as we need clearer data. Public Health England will do a review into this.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s also about increased risks associated with certain ethnic groups, for instance high blood pressure and hypertension is linked to poor outcomes in Covid-19 and is more prevalent in some ethnic groups.</p> \n  <p>The disease is more likely to transmit more in close communities and will have a different impact across different socio-economic statuses. </p> \n  <p>She adds that there is very high representation in the NHS and frontline care services of minority ethnic groups.</p> \n  <p>All these things must be considered, she says.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea319558f08fa2bdcb1af56\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:59:33.140Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

It will end at the end of the year, he adds, to provide certainty to businesses.</p> \n  <p><em>Q. Are you confident that tests will be reliable and what is the failure rate for self-administered tests?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Harries</strong> says tests can fail for several reasons including specificity, storage and sensitivity. This makes it hard to put a number on failure, she says.</p> \n  <p>In piloting the tests, she says, tests have been run in parallel using trained and non-trained persons to trial tests.</p> \n  <p><em>Q. Do you have a message to Donald Trump about the dangers of spreading misinformation?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Harries</strong> says that clearly from a medical, professional perspective, people must use evidence-based and properly trialled treatments.</p> \n  <p>Nobody should be injecting anything, she adds.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea317a78f08e05690dc41eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:52:32.906Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

The chief executive of Heathrow Airport has called on the government for passengers to be screened for Covid-19 as they come into the country, why is this not currently being done?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Shapps</strong> says air travel is \u201cdown massively\u201d and many of those returning have been British nationals. </p> \n  <p>He says the requirements for incoming passengers are to stay in one place and not leave for any reason.</p> \n  <p>He says countries who have taken such measures have not necessarily weathered the pandemic better. </p> \n  <p><strong>Harries</strong> adds that \u201cscreening\u201d can be reassuring and helpful to the public. Early in the pandemic, we quarantined people coming back from high-risk areas, she says. Once the disease is more prevalent, this becomes a less effective mechanism, she adds.</p> \n  <p>Once our rates are very tightly controlled, even then it isn\u2019t so simple, she says, due to variations in reliability in recording temperature and the likelihood in catching somebody during the incubation period. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea3140b8f08e05690dc418a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:35:03.891Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

The seven questions are:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus?</li> \n   <li>Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection?</li> \n   <li>How can it be monitored and enforced?</li> \n   <li>Can it be reversed quickly if it creates unintended consequences?</li> \n   <li>Does it have a positive economic benefit?</li> \n   <li>Does it have a positive impact on people\u2019s wellbeing?</li> \n   <li>Does it have a positive impact on equality?</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Drakeford said that while the unprecedented steps taken to enact the lockdown have helped the NHS and saved many lives, it has come with its own cost to people\u2019s wider health and wellbeing and long-term costs to the economy.

be able to make changes to the restrictions and see a gradual return to something resembling normal life.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Atherton said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>

the lockdown depends on the speed at which the number of new cases of Covid-19 falls and that is as yet \u201cunknown\u201d, the health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> has said.</p> \n  <p>The number of new cases is being tracked through hospital admissions, through a new testing study in the community announced on Wednesday, and data that will be gathered from people coming forward for tests under an expansion of the programme.</p> \n  <p>However, he added that there was no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, and that cases needed to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts could be truly effective.</p> \n  <p>Through a process of mass testing and by isolating infected people and their contacts, ministers hope that future localised outbreaks of coronavirus can be kept under control.</p> \n  <p>Hancock told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now that we\u2019re at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and, if and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will, frankly, determine how long we need to keep the measures on, and that is as yet unknown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down, and the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each individual case that gets a positive test.</p> \n   <p>You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate.</p> \n   <p>The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Physical distancing was driving down the numbers, Hancock said, adding that the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said mass testing, contact tracing and a new contact tracing app were \u201cso crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T11:15:50.120Z\">at 12.15pm BST</time></p>

  "<p>Almost seven weeks after the World Health Organization confirmed the pandemic, Europe remains in <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" title=\"\">the frontline</a> of the battle to contain the Covid-19 virus. Five of the six countries reporting most cases are in Europe. Seven of the 10 countries reporting most deaths are in our continent too. Yet Europe has struggled to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-our-nations-are-self-isolating-too\" title=\"\">common cause</a> against the virus. In particular, it has bickered over how to support the most affected European economies against the consequences of the lockdown. In spite of innumerable acts of cross-border solidarity on the medical front, the rich nations of Europe have proved reluctant backers of the continent\u2019s embattled poorer economies.</p> <p>The good news, relatively speaking, is that this divide has not got worse and may, just possibly, have eased a little. This week, leaders of the 27 EU nations finally signed off on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/clashes-predicted-over-trillion-euro-covid-19-aid-as-eu-meets-online\" title=\"\">\u20ac540bn rescue package</a>. This gives countries such as Italy and Spain, which stand second and third to the United States in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the right to borrow from the eurozone\u2019s bailout mechanism. The problem is that the EU\u2019s southern member states are reluctant to borrow their way out of the problem, in part because they fear that to take on more debt would deepen the inequality between the EU\u2019s south and north.</p> <p>Instead, France and the southern member states want the EU to make financial transfers to its worst-affected members. Some rich states, notably Germany, balk at this. All of them, though, want to avoid a prolongation of the EU\u2019s damaging divisions of March and early April. As a result, the EU27 decided on Thursday that they would <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-back-budget-reboot-for-coronavirus-recovery/\" title=\"\">pass the parcel</a> to Ursula von der Leyen and the European commission, who have been tasked with creating a recovery fund alongside the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget, which is required by the start of 2021.</p> <p>No figures have yet been agreed, but the recovery fund device could prove a smart way of allowing the EU and its richer member states to stand by the poorer ones. In Thursday\u2019s virtual summit, Angela Merkel said that Germany, already the EU budget\u2019s largest net contributor, would make a significantly higher contribution \u201cin the spirit of solidarity\u201d. Ms von der Leyen said afterwards that the EU would be trying to create a funding mechanism that allowed for a balance of grants and loans.</p> <p>This will be anything but easy. Familiar disputes about the size of the EU budget have not disappeared. Indeed, the UK\u2019s departure had made them trickier. Now, in time-honoured fashion, the EU has also kicked the can down the road over the recovery fund. But it cannot do that for long. Ms von der Leyen has only weeks to come up with a package. The package is likely to be enormous. But the economic damage caused by the pandemic means this issue is urgent and could still pose existential questions, as Emmanuel Macron said this week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fa98996-8604-11ea-b872-8db45d5f6714\" title=\"\">for the EU itself</a>.</p> <p>This is a huge moment for the EU. But it has direct implications for Britain too. If the Brexit transition was to be <a href=\"theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/the-guardian-view-on-covid-19-and-brexit-extend-the-transition\" title=\"\">extended into 2021</a>, the UK would have to extend its budget contribution too. It is hard to see the current British government contributing to the EU recovery fund as well. Yet there are no easy choices for any government in the wake of the pandemic shutdown. The EU may be divided over the economic response. But if the choice for Britain lies between cooperation with a divided EU and cooperation with a United States led by a delinquent president who advocates ingesting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-president-advice-bleach\" title=\"\">disinfectant</a>, it would be a no-brainer.</p>",
  "<p>Our lives could all do with a bit of magic in them right now and Justin Quinnell is promising just that: \u201cUsing nothing more than a piece of card,\u201d he says, \u201cpeople can turn their rooms into camera obscuras and create some true lockdown wonder,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Quinnell helps run <a href=\"https://pinholeday.org/\">World Pinhole photography day</a>, which has been going for 20 years and takes place on Sunday 26 April (Quinnell\u2019s birthday). Last year, more than 2,000 people from 57 countries made pinhole images \u2013 usually projecting inverted images of the outside world on to their inside walls \u2013 and uploaded them on to a gallery of pictures taken on that day. I suspect there will be more this time around because, as Quinnell points out, \u201cmore than ever, we need to see our world in a new light\u201d.</p> <p>When I call the Bristolian university lecturer at midday, he\u2019s wearing a face mask and reading Viz while photographing himself in an inverted room projection \u2013 all part of an unusual idea he has for a pinhole photograph. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly stupid,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut although this is such an awful time it\u2019s also a vital opportunity to play and experiment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4e2ed49660c505e1c02ee1867258616e1d547fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4e2ed49660c505e1c02ee1867258616e1d547fc/0_248_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Undeniably a murky, upside-down version of the top of the tree in our back garden.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Undeniably a murky, upside-down version of the top of the tree in our back garden.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Jonze</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quinnell is certainly passionate on his subject. He talks about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/canaletto\">Canaletto</a>, the 18th-century Venetian painter who used the technique to accurately depict his hometown, and explains how experimenting with different pinholes and materials \u2013 thin slits; projecting on to shower curtains \u2013 opens up whole new worlds. \u201cIf you get me going on camera obscuras,\u201d he says, \u201cthe pandemic will be over by the time I\u2019ve finished.\u201d</p> <p>After watching a couple of videos (from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-wKzMHH4A4/\">Quinnell himself</a> and his friend <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/uuulva6\">Di Stoppard in New Zealand</a>), I realise I have already done most of the legwork for this project \u2013 our youngest child is nine months old and his solitary bedroom window has already been blacked out with military precision in the hope he stops waking us at 2am. That\u2019s the main thing you have to do: pick a room with minimal windows \u2013 ideally facing north-ish if you live in the northern hemisphere \u2013 and then seal up all the light that comes in using cardboard, bin bags, T-shirts, black tape, tacks \u2026 whatever you have to hand. Then cut a tiny hole \u2013 about the size of a 5p piece \u2013 in the card covering a window to let a tiny beam of light in. Turn off the room\u2019s lights and - hey presto - an inverted image of the outside world should be projected along the back wall.</p> <p>Using a sharp kitchen knife I sliced a hole in my child\u2019s blackout blind. I then stood on a ladder while holding a duvet draped over the door frame (not how I imagined my journalism career at 40 years of age, admittedly, but these are unusual times) to try to block the light coming through the sides. By this time impatience in both children was creeping in, and I had to assuage my three-year-old daughter and her endless questions (\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cWhy are you on a ladder?\u201d \u201cWhy have you got a knife in Teddy\u2019s bedroom?\u201d) by promising that she would soon witness something both \u201cmagical\u201d and \u201cspooky\u201d. I stretched to turn off the bedroom light with my toe and we stood back to gasp \u2026 at not much. There was no projection. My little boy started crying in the dark. My daughter was bereft. Meh presto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afff7ebc23d9b4fc8c597376ba27b2b6abbff19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afff7ebc23d9b4fc8c597376ba27b2b6abbff19a/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Quinnell\u2019s image of the Clifton suspension bridge, Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to see our world in a new light\u2019 \u2026 Justin Quinnell\u2019s image of the Clifton suspension bridge, Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Quinnell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tried holding up some white card nearer the window and \u2026 well, it wasn\u2019t exactly a super sensory delight. But it was undeniably a murky, upside-down version of the top of the tree in our back garden!</p> <p>\u201cA good start,\u201d said Quinnell politely when I emailed him my efforts. But looking at the <a href=\"https://www.abelardomorell.net/project/camera-obscura/\">work of Abelardo Morell</a> \u2013 the \u201cmaster at this sort of thing\u201d, according to Quinnell \u2013 I realised I had some way to go. Morell has projected vast colourful visions of New York\u2019s Central Park, the London Eye and the Pantheon in Rome into his rooms.</p> <p>Quinnell gave me some tips \u2013 the sunlight was probably too direct and the hole was probably too narrow and too high. Sure enough, when I next attempted my camera obscura, with a lower, larger hole and the sun having risen further, my card lit up with the back garden in full colour \u2013 yellow brick work, green leaves, blue skies and the unmistakable jet black of our satellite dish.

  "<p>Ten European cities have pledged shelter to unaccompanied migrant children living in desperate conditions on Greek island camps or near the Turkish border.</p> <p>Amsterdam, Barcelona and Leipzig are among the cities that have written to European Union leaders, saying they are ready to offer a home to vulnerable children to ease what they call a rapidly worsening humanitarian crisis in Greece.</p> <p>\u201cWe can provide these children with what they now so urgently need: to get out of there, to have a home, to be safe, to have access to medical care and to be looked after by dedicated people,\u201d the letter states.</p> <p>But the cities can only make good on their pledge if national governments agree. Seven of the 10 local government signatories to the letter are in countries that have not volunteered to take in children under a relocation effort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-to-offer-2000-to-migrants-willing-to-go-home-from-greek-islands\">launched by the European commission in March.</a></p> <p>Rutger Groot Wassink, Amsterdam\u2019s deputy mayor for social affairs, said it was disappointing the Dutch government had declined to join the EU relocation scheme. He believes Dutch cities could house 500 children, with \u201c30-35, maybe 40 children\u201d being brought to Amsterdam</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we can send a plane in and pick them up, because you need the permission of the national government. But we feel we are putting pressure on our national government, which has been reluctant to move on this issue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Dutch government \u2013 a four-party liberal-centre-right coalition \u2013 has so far declined to join the EU relocation effort, despite requests by Groot Wassink, who is a member of the Green party.</p> <p>\u201cIt might have something to do with the political situation in the Netherlands, where there is a huge debate on refugees and migrants and the national government doesn\u2019t want to be seen as refugee-friendly. From the perspective of some of the parties they feel that they do enough. They say they are helping Greece and of course there is help for Greece.\u201d</p> <p>If the Dutch government lifted its opposition, Groot Wassink said transfers could happen fairly quickly, despite coronavirus restrictions. \u201cIf there is a will it can be done even pretty soon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ten EU countries \u2013 Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg and Lithuania \u2013 have pledged to take in at least 1,600 lone children from the Greek islands, just under a third of the 5,500 unaccompanied minors estimated to be in Greece.</p> <p>So far, only a small number have been relocated: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/migrant-children-in-greek-island-camps-to-be-relocated-across-eu\">12 to Luxembourg and 47 to Germany</a>.</p> <p>The municipal intervention chimes with comments from the German Social Democrat MEP Brigit Sippel, who said earlier this month that she knew of \u201ccities and German <em>L\u00e4nder</em> who are ready \u2026 tomorrow, to do more\u201d. The MEP said Germany\u2019s federal government was moving too slowly and described the initial transfer of 47 children as \u201cridiculous\u201d.</p> <p>Amsterdam, with Utrecht, organised the initiative through the Eurocities network, which brings together more than 140 of the continent\u2019s largest municipalities, including 20 UK cities. The UK\u2019s home secretary, Priti Patel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/patel-refuses-to-take-children-from-greek-camps-threatened-by-covid-19\">has refused calls</a> to take in lone children from the Greek islands.</p> <p>Groot Wassink said solidarity went beyond the EU\u2019s borders. He said: \u201cYou [the UK] are still part of Europe.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sweden questioned the scientific basis of other EU countries\u2019 strict coronavirus lockdowns as Germany said its number of cases needed to fall from about 2,000 to a few hundred a day before it could ease restrictions further.</p> \n<p>As several European countries continued to cautiously lift lockdowns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/nursery-but-not-as-they-knew-it-norway-adjusts-to-life-after-lockdown\">sending children back to school</a> and reopening some shops and businesses, Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said their original measures looked difficult to justify.</p> \n<p>Sweden has favoured civic responsibility over mandatory rules, closing senior high schools and banning gatherings of more than 50 people, but asking rather than ordering people to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or feeling ill.

  "<p>After a month of gaily swigging wine on a nightly basis on the grounds that there are no school nights right now, I\u2019m getting the impression from friends that they\u2019re beginning to rein back. Not only because it\u2019s bit of a slippery slope \u2013 if one drink, then why not two? \u2013 but it\u2019s not the best start to the following day. Not to mention an extra source of calories on top of all the cake and home-baked bread which we are now enjoying.</p> <p>You could, of course, switch to lower-alcohol wines such as the charmingly elderflowery <strong>King Richard Dry White Wine 2018</strong> (from <a href=\"https://georgehill.co.uk/\">George Hill of Loughborough</a>) I tasted the other day, which is only 10.5%, though I suspect that possibly won\u2019t affect your inclination to finish the bottle (in fact, it might even encourage you to do so). So, nights off are the safest option, but what to drink instead?</p> <p>Since I last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/10/non-alcoholic-drinks-wine-spirits-dry-january-fiona-beckett\">wrote about the subject in January</a>, I\u2019ve still not found an alcohol-free wine I like (the relatively decent Sangre de Toro range in Majestic \u2013 see panel below \u2013 comes closest to it), so it\u2019s all about whatever cocktails you can concoct from what you\u2019ve got available. The most obvious option being a G&amp;T equivalent, assuming you can get the tonic. I tried to make my own from cinchona bark when I was researching my latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-drink-without-drinking-9780857836151.html\">How to Drink without Drinking</a>, but it was pretty disgusting and also now scarce since it was (questionably) <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/no-cinchona-bark-is-not-a-cure-for-coronavirus-134947\">touted as a cure for coronavirus</a>) Where it was once mildly annoying that products such as <a href=\"https://seedlipdrinks.com/uk/\">Seedlip</a> were much the same price as regular gin, it\u2019s now a cause for quiet fury. It\u2019s ironic, is it not, that alcohol-free spirits are so much dearer than wine? Anyway, <a href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/shelf/drinks/no-low-alcohol/no-low-alcohol-spirits/no-low-alcohol-spirits/669942176\">Asda has the cheapest options</a> at the moment.</p> <p>As I write, fruit juices are still widely available, but I find them a bit viscous and syrupy to drink with food, and there\u2019s only so much OJ you can put up with in self-isolation. The answer, I find, is to dilute it with water or, better still, water kefir (plus a few drops of orange flower water, if you have some). Or use juices to make cocktails such as a sea breeze (pink grapefruit juice, cranberry juice and lime) or the summery \u201ccroquet\u201d I invented for the book: 50ml each of a light gin substitute such as Ceder\u2019s (see panel below) and cloudy apple juice and 100ml cucumber tonic water. And lots of ice. Ice makes everything better.</p> <h2>Five drinks to help you survive booze-free nights</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"12-point spacer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2a9ca5c7faa70e2ef60219dd4a788b0a1c7415fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a9ca5c7faa70e2ef60219dd4a788b0a1c7415fc/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sangre de Toro rose\u0301\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Sangre de Toro Ros\u00e9 0% </strong><a href=\"https://www.majestic.co.uk/wines/sangre-de-toro-rose-0-8229\">\u00a34.99 Majestic</a> (orders are being taken and deliveries made through local stores).

The year is 1668: Charles II is on the throne and Richard Cromwell, son of Oliver, is supposedly in exile. However, in the eight years since the Restoration the king\u2019s popularity has begun to wane and, amid growing unease about both his extravagance and the licentiousness of his court, nostalgia for the protectorate is taking hold. Lovett is more irritated than diverted when Richard\u2019s daughter Elizabeth wants to renew their friendship. However, the meeting is far from coincidental, and soon both Lovett and Marwood are drawn into the cut and thrust of political intrigue and find themselves in great danger.

While local men were being slaughtered on battlefields in the north of the country, the women and children left behind to tend the fields shrank in fear as the hills above them reverberated to the sound of hungry lions and tigers.

  "<p>Camden might seem like a strange place for a coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s a small, historic city in central South Carolina \u2013 just over 7,500 people. It\u2019s neither densely packed like New York nor economically decimated like Detroit. One of its main industries is tourism, with people visiting to see Revolutionary War re-enactments and the annual horse race every spring.</p> <p>But on 6 March the first Covid-19 case was confirmed positive \u2013 an elderly woman whose family had visited her after traveling to Europe. Soon after that, Camden had the fastest-growing number of cases, and deaths, in the state. At one point it had the most coronavirus cases per capita in the country.</p> <p>While Camden\u2019s local officials worked relatively quickly to try to contain the virus, experts say it\u2019s not surprising that the city was caught unprepared. The South Carolina government has systematically dismantled public health infrastructure for over a decade \u2013 from reductions to the health budget to diluting a minority health program. The state\u2019s response to the pandemic was one of the slowest in the country.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting dynamic \u2013 it\u2019s state, local and federal,\u201d said state senator Vincent Sheheen, who represents Kershaw county, where Camden is the seat. \u201cI think that\u2019s where the problems come in: who is responsible for what? That has not been well defined, and it wasn\u2019t well defined before the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>This disconnect was clear starting with the first Covid-19 test. When health workers suspected the Camden woman of having the virus, the state refused to process a swab sample, Sheheen said, because she didn\u2019t meet the criteria. It was days after the patient was admitted to Kershaw Health, the county\u2019s only hospital, that the state\u2019s department of health and environmental control (DHEC) agreed.</p> <p>For a few days, as Camden city officials worked to formulate a plan and shut down public events, people still went out to restaurants and events. An Irish Fest, being held that weekend, took place. So did a funeral, which tracing later linked to <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/coronavirus/article242028041.html?fbclid=IwAR2pt9DCcuf-istDtAUsHJuwx9c4dpGV3qhSlxpWewM6-O-lWMAz3x9aApg\">six deaths</a> in the city.</p> <p>\u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d said Nyasha Green, a 30-year-old Camden native who now lives half an hour away from her parents in Columbia. \u201cThey should have quarantined people already.\u201d</p> <p>By the next week, however, the city had shut down public gatherings, and was working to close the area\u2019s many churches. Dozens of businesses closed their doors, and city council members urged people to stay home. By 14 March, Camden shut down schools, and some days later, enforced a 10pm curfew.</p> <p>\u201cWe started taking precautions before the state had a chance to lead,\u201d said Mel Pearson, the city manager. \u201cWe knew this was a risky virus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fad52158360c20efba82f595e2a6d9fd2e07add3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad52158360c20efba82f595e2a6d9fd2e07add3/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty church stands in a rural and economically distressed part of Camden, South Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty church stands in a rural and economically distressed part of Camden, South Carolina. \u2018The standard of living is low.

  "<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to sweep around the world. As more vaccine trials swung into action and the unequal burden of deaths became clear, governments came under fresh fire to rekindle their ailing economies.</p> \n<p><strong>More vaccine trials start as drug hope fades<br></strong>The first shots of an experimental vaccine from Oxford University were administered to volunteers.

As of 21 April, all 10 had published some racial demographic data, but four \u2013 Texas, Florida, New York and Michigan \u2013 had not included a breakdown for Native Americans. A spokesperson for the Texas department of state health services said that Native Americans were categorized as \u201cother\u201d because their case numbers were small compared with other groups.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a small population of people because of genocide.

When the Urban Indian Health Institute did its own research, it found Native women living in cities were 4.5 times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women.</p> <p>Health experts have also warned that local and state health departments that are including Native Americans in their demographic data are still likely to be undercounting Native Covid-19 patients and deaths due to racial misclassification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9d69d511796fe054cb9f549ce1820fa5f015597\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9d69d511796fe054cb9f549ce1820fa5f015597/0_0_2400_1614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Murphy/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to some studies, Native Americans have a 50% chance of being listed as the wrong race on medical records, as well as birth and death certificates. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545338/\">A 2015 study of hospital discharge records in Oregon</a> found that over half of Native patients had been miscategorized on their file, the majority as white.

But IHS cannot track hospitalization or mortality data for most of its patients, because the majority of IHS facilities do not provide intensive care, and so critically ill patients are transferred to non-IHS hospitals.</p> <p>The \u201cIHS may not be notified of deaths\u201d wrote an agency spokesperson. Therefore \u201cto avoid underreporting\u201d, IHS is only publishing testing results, they said.</p> <p>But testing numbers are also incomplete. The IHS includes a network of facilities operated<strong> </strong> by the IHS, tribal health services,<strong> </strong>and urban providers. Only IHS direct service facilities are required to report their data , representing about 17% of the facilities in the system. For all others, data sharing is voluntary. According to an IHS spokesperson, about a third of tribally run and urban facilities have reported their numbers.</p> <p>IHS is also hampered by an electronic record system that was developed in the 1980s. An IHS spokesperson said \u201ca replacement is necessary\u201d but in the meantime, \u201cCovid-19 surveillance data is being collected manually\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHealth disparities are nice words for systematic racism \u2026 it\u2019s the residual effects of the founding of this country,\u201d social demographer Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear (Cheyenne) told the Guardian. </p> <p>But Rodriguez-Lonebear said it was not enough to just include Native Americans in demographic data; the data also needs to include tribal affiliation. For tribal governments, she said, \u201cbeing able to identify who your citizens are in these big data sets is so vital to being able to understand the impact of the virus on your tribe\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike states and counties, tribes cannot rely on healthcare systems to tell them when their citizens are sick or dying and must collect the data themselves. The Guardian asked 15 state and local health departments with high Native populations if they were collecting tribal affiliation.

  "<p>Donald Trump has stunned viewers by suggesting people could receive injections of disinfectant to cure the coronavirus, a notion one medical expert described as \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d.</p> \n<p>At Thursday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, the US president mused on new government research into how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-31/\">Trump said</a>: \u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute! And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds interesting to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Deborah Birx, the taskforce response coordinator, remained silent. But social media erupted in outrage at the president, who has a record of defying science and also floated the idea of treating patients\u2019 bodies with ultraviolet (UV) light.</p> \n<p>Several doctors warned the public against injecting disinfectant or using UV light and a leading household cleaner manufacturer urged users not to inject it into their bodies.</p> \n<p>Reckitt Benckiser, the British-based maker of Dettol and Lysol, said in a <a href=\"https://link.axios.com/click/20120979.111210/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmIuY29tL21lZGlhL25ld3MvMjAyMC9hcHJpbC9pbXByb3Blci11c2Utb2YtZGlzaW5mZWN0YW50cy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NhbSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/58c6e533a79328702e8b4bbfBa870d92f\">statement</a>: \u201cWe must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).\u201d</p> \n<p>Political commentators joined the condemnation. Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former labor secretary, tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s briefings are actively endangering the public\u2019s health. Boycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don\u2019t drink disinfectant.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, added: \u201cIt is incomprehensible to me that a moron like this holds the highest office in the land and that there exist people stupid enough to think this is OK. I can\u2019t believe that in 2020 I have to caution anyone listening to the president that injecting disinfectant could kill you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump was already facing a backlash over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">championing of hydroxychloroquine</a>, an anti-malaria drug, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">therapy for the coronavirus</a>, a quixotic effort amplified by the conservative network Fox News.

We\u2019ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favourable to the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Researchers found that the virus survives best indoors and in dry conditions, and loses potency when temperatures and humidity rise. Bryan said: \u201cThe virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.\u201d</p> \n<p>He showed a slide summarising the results of the experiment that were carried out at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center. He also said tests had been carried out with disinfectants and isopropyl alcohol, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that\u2019s with no manipulation, no rubbing \u2013 just spraying it on and letting it go. You rub it and it goes away even faster. We\u2019re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the Covid-19 virus in saliva.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fcba6d89643c2c0095044f7e6a6ce9a0d975e2af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcba6d89643c2c0095044f7e6a6ce9a0d975e2af/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump prompted awkwardness when he asked if Dr Birx had heard of heat and light in relation to coronavirus. \u2018Not as a treatment,\u2019 she said.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump prompted awkwardness when he asked if Dr Birx had heard of heat and light in relation to coronavirus. \u2018Not as a treatment,\u2019 she said.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump seized on the findings to refer back to a claim he made on 14 February that warm weather might kill the virus, like common flu, noting that he had been criticised by the media. \u201cI think a lot of people are going to go outside, all of a sudden, people that didn\u2019t want to go outside,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>And he asked Bryan an extraordinary question: \u201cSo I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you\u2019re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2013 whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2013 and I think you said that that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you\u2019re going to test that too. It sounds interesting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bryan responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the right folks who could.\u201d</p> \n<p>UV rays are an invisible type of radiation that can penetrate and damage skin cells, and overexposure can cause skin cancer. How much sunlight would be needed to have an effect on the coronavirus is unknown. The virus has caused heavy death tolls in warm-weather areas such as Louisiana and Florida, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/singapore-million-migrant-workers-suffer-as-covid-19-surges-back\">Singapore has seen a recent surge in cases</a>.</p> \n<p>A Washington Post reporter asked if it was dangerous for Trump to make people think they would be safe by going outside in summer heat. The president turned to Bryan and said: \u201cI would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there\u2019s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a cringeworthy moment, he asked Birx if she had ever heard of heat and light in relation to the coronavirus. \u201cNot as a treatment,\u201d she said, explaining that the body responds to the virus with a fever.</p> \n<p>When the Post reporter pressed further, Trump retorted: \u201cI\u2019m the president and you\u2019re fake news \u2026 I\u2019m just here to present talent, I\u2019m here to present ideas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Experts questioned why the homeland security report had been promoted at the briefing. <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ir2110\">Dr Irwin Redlener,</a> the director of the Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told MSNBC: \u201cEverything that this scientist talked about from homeland security was basically incoherent, nonsensical, not really supported by evidence and really quite contrary to a lot of things that we do know about some of the things he was saying.</p> \n<p>\u201cFirst of all, people do get Covid, have been getting Covid in warm climates. Second of all, this issue with UV light is hypothetical, but also UV light can be very harmful and we did not hear anything resembling a balanced discussion of what the evidence is for and against UV light, but it\u2019s certainly not ready for prime time.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe very fact that the president actually asked somebody about what sounded like injecting disinfectants or isopropyl alcohol into the human body was kind of jaw-dropping.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>According to Deirdre Mask, \u201cmost households in the world don\u2019t have street addresses\u201d. That includes many parts of rural America. When Mask took a trip to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-virginia\">West Virginia</a> to find an acquaintance who doesn\u2019t have an address, she got lost: \u201cFor generations, people had navigated West Virginia in creative ways. Directions are delivered in paragraphs.\u201d The lack of an address can be a matter of life and death if you need an ambulance. Some drivers have resorted to asking people to listen out for the siren and to guide them by phone: \u201cGetting hotter? Getting closer?\u201d</p> <p>But giving people a street address is not simple. For a start, many don\u2019t want one. One farmer was outraged that his street was to be named after the banker who refused his grandfather a loan during the Great Depression. Workers setting up signs have been greeted by men with shotguns.</p> <p>Of course, addresses are not just there to help friends find you. They also allow the state to tax its citizens and the police to locate suspects. As Mask\u2019s book shows, the names and numbers of our streets are rooted in an Enlightenment project to control and quantify the state\u2019s subjects.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the US it took eight years for a street to be named after Martin Luther King Jr</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mexico City has at least 500 streets named after Emiliano Zapata, leader of their peasant revolution, and Russia more than 4,000 named after Lenin. In the US it took eight years for a street to be named after Martin Luther King Jr following his death. Mask, an African American lawyer and scholar, also describes the remarkable campaign by residents of Hollywood, Florida, to rename streets in their predominantly black community that were named after confederate generals, as are more than a thousand streets in the south. The new names were Liberty Street, Freedom Street and Hope Street.</p> <p>Mask\u2019s fascinating study is filled with insights into how addresses affect ordinary people around the world. She concludes the future may lie in GPS apps. In the end, despite the political associations and the effect on property values of street names (in Australia unusual names such as Wanke Road can knock 20% off values), Mask likes the controversies: \u201cArguments are what divide communities, but they are also what constitutes them <em>as</em> communities.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Address Book: What Street Addresses Reveal About Identity, Race, Wealth, and Power </em><em>is published by Profile.

  "<p>Sometimes escapist films only need to take the audience a few steps, or city blocks, from reality. Gregory La Cava\u2019s My Man Godfrey, a peerless comedy from Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, is a screwball with a social conscience. This 1936 classic is a glamorous 90 minutes of frivolity that doesn\u2019t so much explore the divided society of the Great Depression, as take the imbalance between the haves and have-nots as the launchpad for a series of grimly bitter jokes. With slammers of punchlines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/20/results-film-guy-pearce-andrew-bujalski\">My streaming gem: why you should watch Results</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the movie\u2019s audacious opening scene, we meet William Powell as Godfrey, \u201cDuke\u201d to his down-at-heel pals. He\u2019s a tramp, apparently, living on a New York City dump under the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. Two cars pull up next to the ash piles, disgorging Cornelia and Irene Bullock, \u201cPark Avenue brats\u201d in evening wear. They\u2019ve come to find a \u201cForgotten Man\u201d, a victim of the Depression, as part of a grotesque scavenger hunt game being played by the wealthy patrons of the glittering (fictional) Waldorf Ritz Hotel. Offered five dollars to be dragged into the foyer as a prize, Godfrey quite understandably pushes the haughty Cornelia into a heap of muck. But his relationship with Irene (Carole Lombard) takes a more interesting turn. Irene wins the scavenger hunt by bringing Godfrey to the hotel, but also gives him a job as the family butler. This being a comedy, romance will ensue. But as it\u2019s a screwball, something nastier will follow.</p> <p>The humour in My Man Godfrey is madcap, but in the best way, and the main source of comedy is the vulgar behaviour of the spoiled, witless Bullock family. Their zigzagging conversations are filled with entertaining gibberish about proteges and pets, until their disregard for the wellbeing of those who work for them becomes as ridiculous as it is mean. Alice Brady is particularly unhinged as the alcohol-addled mother, who sees pixies but not the plain truth. Eugene Pallette has a more flattering role as the exasperated patriarch. While the Bullocks have the most sparkling dialogue, the lower-class characters have the best lines. Told that \u201cprosperity is just around the corner\u201d, one tramp mutters, \u201cI wish I knew which corner\u201d, while Godfrey\u2019s exchanges with the Bullocks\u2019 maid (\u201cMay I be frank\u201d \u2013 \u201cIs that your name?\u201d) are far more to the point that the family\u2019s meaningless noise. The dialogue is mostly the work of director La Cava, who co-wrote the script with Morrie Ryskind from Eric Hatch\u2019s novel 1101 Fifth Avenue, but also liked to improvise on the shoot. Lombard said that anyone who enjoyed the film should \u201ccredit 75% of it to Gregory La Cava, who directed it, wrote all the dialogue, and literally gave birth to it\u201d. Her own on-set ad libs were mostly too blue to make the final cut.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8xoAtKjnqs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O8xoAtKjnqs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a sly film too, that satirises and glamorises in the same breath, where a hotel foyer full of high-society types is compared to a lunatic asylum. It\u2019s likely Lombard never wore a more beautiful gown than the shimmering silver number, complete with cape, that Travis Banton designed for her to wear in this film. That her character wears it to a trash-heap, in search of a human prize \u201cthat nobody wants\u201d, is the essence of the film\u2019s satire. And yet poor Irene is one of the best of a bad bunch: sincere if stupid, kind-hearted if misguided.</p> <p>Lombard remains the queen of the screwball subgenre, and her Irene, who talks, and acts, in an outlandish stream of consciousness, is one of her finest creations. \u201cNutty, slaphappy, goofy\u201d was how her friend Mitchell Leisen summed up Irene, recalling how Lombard strove to make sense of a woman whose words \u201clacked continuity, were unrelated and without thought\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the diverting babble and dramatic poses, her character has a clear path. From the moment she meets Godfrey in the dump, her life of luxury begins to tarnish. As she explains the rules of the scavenger hunt, she seems astonished by the absurd cruelty of the project \u2013 a prank she once took for granted that now seems as strange as wearing a silver evening gown to a Hooverville shanty town. It\u2019s the start of something. Irene and Godfrey have a few layers of pretence to shed before they can be united \u2013 his pretensions are just as calculated as her artful tantrums, although he has nobler intentions.</p> <p>There\u2019s joy to be found in the romance between Godfrey and Irene, though in this comedy of misunderstanding, their affair runs along parallel tracks, seemingly destined never to meet. Powell and Lombard spark beautifully with each other. Well they might: they had previously been married for two years, and remained pals in the three years since their divorce. In fact Powell nominated Lombard for the role \u2013 he knew she was the best fit for the film \u2013 and their divorce had been as amicable as their marriage, which was undone by the 16-year age difference, and then Lombard\u2019s introduction to Clark Gable, who would become the great love of her short life.</p> <p>Hollywood escapism is rarely as simple as it promises to be, and the best Golden Age treasures have more to offer than silk gowns and sharp dialogue. As films tend to, My Man Godfrey offers a neat, gentrified solution to many of America\u2019s prevailing ills, one that may seem increasingly unconvincing as the decades turn by. Films may not be the place to make social policy, but the best of them can make us look at the world in new way, just as Irene does.</p> <ul> <li><p>My Man Godfrey is available on Amazon Prime in the UK and US</p></li> </ul>",

He still hasn\u2019t lost a game in charge of the Socceroos since he came down under, but he\u2019ll taste the sickly sweet bile of defeat in his mouth tonight.</p> <p>The sadness in the voice of Craig Foster after full-time said it all. The emptiness of Johnny Warren\u2019s post-match analysis. It\u2019s inexplicable that this team - having played <em>that </em>match, aren\u2019t going to France to mix it with Rivaldo, Zinedine Zidane etc. They utterly dominated Iran, the Socceroos. It could have been five-nil inside the first ten minutes.

  "<p>Black pools, long trenches and charred earth have become common sights in the fields of north-west Syria, signs of an informal oil economy that has developed during the war.</p> <p>Despite damaging both the environment and health, up to 5,000 backyard oil refineries, crucial to the livelihoods of besieged Syrians, have cropped up in recent years, identified through satellite imagery in <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/24/dying-to-keep-warm-oil-trade-and-makeshift-refining-in-north-west-syria/\">a report</a> by open source investigators Bellingcat.</p> <p>In and around the last remaining rebel-held areas, these refineries have provided fuel to a region where almost half the population has been displaced internally or from elsewhere in Syria. Yet they also bring a range of risks, according to the report\u2019s author Wim Zwijnenburg, a researcher with Dutch peace advocacy group Pax.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a need for oil and you could see on satellite imagery that artisanal refinery was growing but there are also concerns about health because of the dangerous working conditions like barrels that could explode,\u201d said Zwijnenburg. \u201cPeople were exposed to toxic fumes from burning that\u2019s going on, and also a lot of children were involved.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You see issues around respiratory problems, skin diseases and you see long-term concerns about cancer</p> <footer> <cite>Wim Zwijnenburg, Pax</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The clusters of refineries around the region receive oil transported from fields in eastern Syria and process it into fuel used for cooking, heating and transport by using rudimentary set-ups to burn it.</p> <p>The open source material and satellite imagery used by Zwijnenburg shows that many refineries have emerged in fields that were still green until 2016.</p> <p>There had previously been tens of thousands of refineries operating in north-east Syria, closer to the oil fields, before territory was seized from Isis and formal production returned.</p> <p>Locals say the toxic smoke produced by the refineries has caused air pollution, contaminated water supplies and <a href=\"https://www.qasioun-news.com/en/news/show/200286/More_than_explosion_in_oil_refinery_in_Sarmada_Idlib__Video\">caused explosions</a> that have forced a response from the White Helmets, the rescue group that runs operations in anti-government areas.</p> <p>\u201cSome of these locations are operational for a year, so you see issues around respiratory problems, skin diseases and you see long-term concerns about cancer. Burning this fuel day in, day out raises a lot of concerns among locals,\u201d said Zwijnenburg.</p> <p>He said oil waste produced by these operations was increasingly turned into cooking coals, which heightens health risks because it involves scraping the waste from barrels used in the burning process.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very dirty job,\u201d said Syrian activist Wissam Zarqa. \u201c[A worker\u2019s] skin would become darkened all the time, not from lack of cleanness.

My son was very small and he developed breathing problems.\u201d</p> <p>The resident said, however, that the refineries had also become important for Syrians living in rebel-held areas. This was partly because oil, which costs more than $100 (\u00a381) a barrel, has become so expensive, and partly down to refineries becoming a major source of work, both within processing plants and for those who transport oil from the oil fields.</p> <p>Much of the oil is transported by tanker through Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria, activity that has been captured on satellite imagery included in the Bellingcat report.</p> <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has claimed that much of the oil is pumped from fields in Kurdish-held areas and owned by politicians with <a href=\"http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=123563&amp;__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=cba6fa31fa94773678edd822c2231e9c9d765e13-1587554750-0-AdKULJHvYRDWacIb-QPlO8IxyFeUo3MWJy2s2s2vqZymny5BAU_GQC7b9Ewn5pRYOF3N5slwmLQEiKBMLpCZCYeYAUldKJ8Dir2X349GJbWtWraBT1xbXdA3pstBRNeTicisfm2h-A77C9TRaTME1QVVl33wWaK-BRqCNk4Y_7ul7fTWPe1T6DfLiHteIBVhZYdkyDBlgqMPFlTu_b_zUAMhS6buDPUUlyY1xPcD0CA0q_DKaYTBFdxHiD7rrSvcWlJdOldvUCekuqCsrPq3-Ovl6wGOA1qt86pkw660PMQW\">links to President Bashar al-Assad</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/31/planting-hope-the-syrian-refugee-who-developed-virus-resistant-super-seeds\">Planting hope: the Syrian refugee who developed virus-resistant super-seeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A bombing campaign by Assad\u2019s forces and Russia displaced hundreds of thousands in Idlib and intensified food and fuel shortages through the winter, especially as many of the refineries were targeted.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fundamental problem for the residents here, fuel is needed for cars and to fuel the ovens we need to bake bread,\u201d the former resident said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t have a choice, they are forced by this matter,\u201d he added, suggesting that the refineries would not be needed if fuel were provided to them or prices were cheaper.</p> <p>\u201cIf only there was some help to providing an alternative, people would take another route.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2020 to correct the main picture caption, which described the oil refinery at al-Qahtaniyah as being in the north-west of Syria when it is in the north-east.</p>",
  "<p><strong>You began an 81-day confinement on 3 April 2011. What happened that day?<br></strong>That day, I woke up and prepared to go to the airport with my assistant Jennifer, who had begun working with me not long before. This was our first trip together and we were going to go to Taiwan to prepare for an exhibition opening later that autumn. Our flight was to Hong Kong where we would transfer to Taipei. <br> Many things happened in the days before the trip. I had been under surveillance and followed by secret police for years, but the days before the trip involved more frequent visits. There were all kinds of excuses: a fire safety check, residential registrations, many strange reasons that had not been used before. I could sense something was coming, but I could never have imagined what would happen.  They could have come to my home in Beijing to see me and take me away if they had wanted to. They could have come and questioned me at any time, but they never directly confronted me. When we approached the immigration checkpoint that day, I knew something was going to happen. A police officer took my passport and I saw the other police gathered in the hall begin moving toward me. Another police officer came and told me he had something to discuss. I followed him into another room. From there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/03/ai-weiwei-detained-chinese-police\">I was led to a car, a black hood was put over my head</a> and I was driven to an unknown area. That was the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/17/ai-weiwei-protests-1001-chairs\">81 days of solitary confinement</a>.</p> <p><strong>How have you revisited the confinement in your own art?<br></strong>I created a few pieces related to the period of detention. There was <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/ai-weiwei-13-works-to-know\">SACRED</a>, an installation consisting of six iron boxes with scale dioramas depicting my detention conditions. It showed in exact detail how I slept, walked, ate, was interrogated, washed and used the toilet. I also made <a href=\"https://aiweiwei.com/mixed-media/the-divine-comedy/index.html\">The Divine Comedy</a>, a heavy rock album that directly reflected this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01/0_0_4852_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene inside one of six containers that comprise SACRED at the Royal Academy in London in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scene inside one of six containers that comprise SACRED at the Royal Academy in London in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>With this play, your confinement became an artwork \u2013 how does that feel?<br></strong>When I heard of the play, I felt that it was created in the same spirit as my work at that time. I was trying to fight through all possible forms: artworks, online activities, interviews, happenings, photographs, videos. I would use whatever medium I could get. <br> What I have learned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/24/how-xi-jinping-became-networked-authoritarian-thanks-to-little-red-app\">living in this kind of authoritarian society</a> is that the struggle is often very difficult. Most of the time, your voice cannot be heard. There is no platform without censorship and tight police control. And even if you had a voice, very few people would be able to hear it. Those outside of China are too far away and nobody cares what they have to say. Those within China have the attention of a very small audience that shares the same feelings and can follow the argument. The arguments are not necessarily popular ones, either philosophically or aesthetically, and it takes some effort to follow along. <br> So when I heard at the time that a good theatre in London was putting on a play based on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/06/hanging-man-weiwei-martin-review\">book by Barnaby Martin</a>, who is someone I knew to be very alert and attentive to my situation, I was encouraged and felt like it became a part of my activity.</p> <p><strong>How did the confinement change you?<br></strong>This was a very harsh experience and it\u2019s difficult to grasp it, or even deal with it. It\u2019s not a common experience so it\u2019s hard to share with another. There is no existing vocabulary to illustrate a condition that requires a special kind of reality. Once it comes to a point when the authority cannot rationally communicate or have a clear exchange of ideas or when they cannot allow the argument, then the only thing they can do is to make you feel that rationality, moral judgment and the law no longer work. They must prove to you that nothing works except power itself. And that power is identified with incomprehensible treatment, which can be ridiculous and surreal, but you must follow every step and detail to get through it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ad0239ecca9b18f39450d1c79643b62a8f0dbe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ad0239ecca9b18f39450d1c79643b62a8f0dbe1/0_0_4728_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei with David Lee-Jones, Richard Rees and Andrew Leung in #aiww: The Arrest of Ai WeiWei by Howard Brenton at Hampstead theatre in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei with David Lee-Jones, Richard Rees and Andrew Leung in #aiww: The Arrest of Ai WeiWei by Howard Brenton at Hampstead theatre in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The play\u2019s title includes the hashtag #aiww. How did social media change your life?<br></strong>It\u2019s an intelligent title. It\u2019s not social media that changed my entire life. My entire life is social media. Without social media, \u201cAi Weiwei\u201d simply does not exist. I live by social media. In a religious sense, it\u2019s not unlike the biblical reference to \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life\u201d.</p> <p><strong>In the play, the interrogators accuse you of being a fraud and a conman. Did this happen \u2013 and does it reflect any kind of internal criticism you may have about your art and the marketplace?<br></strong>It\u2019s quite strange. The interrogators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/22/ai-weiwei-an-artist-must-be-an-activist\">never believed that what I did could be called art</a>. They could not believe that something I took could be called art, or that something I dropped could be called art, or an action on the internet or pointing my middle finger toward a monument could be called art. They thought I was famous because I was paid by western anti-China forces. I do not blame them. I don\u2019t care whether my work is called art or not. I am an artist because I have no other job; it is not that I like the title very much. It is the only title where you don\u2019t have to do very much and no one will question it because people don\u2019t understand art anyway. I enjoy the liberty of being someone who is doing nothing practical. At the same time, in the west, including the art world, they think my work isn\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d. I guess it is because I am not playing the game in the same way they are playing it, or my voice is different from their way of singing. This part I enjoy even more. If I have to call myself an artist, I would rather be different from the others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655fc0b351856f6cba8abd67c48c79fe7d52059d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655fc0b351856f6cba8abd67c48c79fe7d52059d/0_299_2728_3097/881.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei in the play.\" width=\"881\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei in the play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Your father was imprisoned \u2013 did you find strength through his experience during these 81 days?<br></strong>At the beginning of my detention, I was so proud of myself. I matched my father\u2019s experience from 80 years ago when he was imprisoned by the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) for political subversion. I was told my crime was subversion against the state. <br> Before I was detained, I was jealous of my father for having been imprisoned. Having grown up in this communist society, I was supposed to be a part of the second revolutionary generation. Having learned everything from Chairman Mao\u2019s education, there was no chance for me to be a criminal. That was true until I made arguments about the lawfulness of the existing party. I became the ultimate enemy of the established power, but still without a crime. They don\u2019t have to like me, but I did not think they would put me in jail. Once that was achieved, I kind of felt happy because it gave me an opportunity to argue my reasoning with them face to face.</p> <p>Before the arrest, confrontations were never direct because they did not want to have any argument. First, they don\u2019t think you are entitled to an argument and, second, they are incapable of making an argument. I had tried to initiate the argument for years on the internet. It became my own game. No one was answering me and therefore the argument couldn\u2019t go further. I was fighting against an invisible enemy, which is everywhere but nowhere at the same time. So when it did happen, I thought it was wonderful. We are sitting face to face, two metres across, looking at each other. You ask a question and I answer. I felt some sense of power and usefulness in being confronted directly.</p> <p><strong>What advice do you have for artists who are struggling financially and spiritually at this time of lockdown?<br></strong>Give up art. Do something which can bring home bread and soap. Rob a bank, but do not get caught.</p> <p><strong>There is a lengthy discussion in the play about how best to prepare Beijing noodles. What is your preferred method?<br></strong>You need to watch the noodles cook, not for too long or too short. It is really dependent on what kind of sauce you are cooking with.

  "<p>In Sri Lanka, police have been enforcing tough lockdown measures and a strict curfew since March. The country\u2019s inspector general has instructed police to take action against social media users who criticise the government or spread \u201cmalicious\u201d pandemic information.</p> <p>An exception has been made, however, for the country\u2019s tea pickers.

There are no facilities to wash hands with soap during a shift and masks are not always issued, even though it has been mandatory to wear them in public since early April.</p> <p>Some workers have bought their own masks. Others improvise with handkerchiefs and serviettes. Where companies provide a cloth mask, the cost can be deducted from wages. In the humidity and heat, Red Flag has observed women constantly touching their faces to wipe away sweat. The union is concerned that, without health education, the masks may not be washed daily or used correctly. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18c37583aea74b593d5e26ca72e8a13eed626e8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18c37583aea74b593d5e26ca72e8a13eed626e8b/0_288_4583_2749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soldiers patrol along a street in Colombo during the nationwide lockdown in Sri Lanka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soldiers patrol along a street in Colombo during the nationwide lockdown in Sri Lanka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A pressing concern is living conditions. Accommodation on tea estates generally consists of overcrowded, tin-roofed \u201cline rooms\u201d, usually five consecutive rooms in long rows. Each 30-square-metre room is a household, making social distancing impossible. Toilets are sometimes communal.</p> <p>Because of the curfew, partners and children working and living in urban areas have been returning, so rooms are more overcrowded.

The plantation system, devised by British colonialists in the 1820s, was run with an indentured workforce, uprooted from India\u2019s Tamil Nadu. The population of about 840,000 people only gained Sri Lankan citizenship in 2003.</p> <p>Today, the work remains physically demanding, with poverty and debt bondage weighing heavily on estate communities.

  "<p>Brexit talks on the future relationship between the UK and the EU resumed this week after a six-week interruption caused by coronavirus.</p> <p>Over five days and 40 video sessions, 10 negotiating teams were expected to provide an urgent \u201crefocus\u201d before the 30 June deadline for both sides to formally agree to extend the transition period if the UK asks for one.</p> <p>Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s lead negotiator, will host a press conference at noon on Friday in Brussels to give updates, but his team were told on Monday that Boris Johnson was not budging on the issue of the extensions.</p> <p>Barnier\u2019s opposite number, David Frost, opened the first plenary session by \u201creiterating the government wish not to extend the transition period and that the job could be done by the end of the year\u201d.</p> <p>Some observers said the UK government\u2019s position that an extension is not necessary was astonishing given the depth of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Philip Rycroft, a former chief civil servant at the now defunct Brexit department, <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/civil-service-whitehall-brexit-transition-extension-covid-19-coronavirus\">told Prospect</a> magazine: \u201cIt is simple common sense to ask for an extension of the transition period.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank, believes an extension is inevitable but Johnson has \u201cno incentive\u201d to seek one until June, the deadline for a one-off UK request.</p> <p>\u201cA free-trade agreement could still be agreed but it would be hard to implement. Even if we were coming to the end of this pandemic by then, businesses will be not be prepared,\u201d said Lowe, who described himself as optimistic that a free-trade deal could be done by the end of the year, albeit a poor one.</p> <p>This week\u2019s talks centred solely on the future relationship. A separate strand of work is under way on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement signed off in January.</p> <p>Here is an overview of who is involved in the discussions and what areas are covered.</p> <h2>Joint committee</h2> <p>Featuring Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, a European commission vice-president, the committee met for the first time on 30 March and will make decisions on recommendations made by civil servants who will staff six specialised committees.</p> <p>Those committees cover the Northern Ireland protocol; citizens\u2019 rights; British sovereign army bases in Cyprus, the divorce bill, Gibraltar and \u201cother separation issues\u201d. Who is on the committees, how often they will meet and precisely what they will be exploring has yet to be disclosed.</p> <h2>Northern Ireland checks</h2> <p>The Ireland Northern Ireland specialised committee (INISC) will meet for the first time on 30 April. The Cabinet Office has confirmed that the INISC will be \u201ccomprised of official-level representatives of the EU and the UK\u201d and will \u201cmeet as regularly as required to facilitate engagement between the UK and the EU on protocol implementation\u201d.</p> <p>A working group will also be set up to feed into the committee. TheCabinet Office says it will act \u201cas a forum for the exchange of information and mutual consultation\u201d on implementation. So expect industry bodies and experts to be asked to submit to this group.</p> <p>The remaining specialised committees have not yet been scheduled.</p> <p>Thomas Lieflaender, the deputy head of the European Commission\u2019s Brexit task force, is being tipped to lead the INISC along with a senior figure from the Northern Ireland office, possibly Andrew McCormick, the executive\u2019s director general of international relations.</p> <p>One concern is that civil servants cannot make decisions on politically charged issues such as what checks will be conducted and where.</p> <p> Jess Sargeant, a researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the INISC was likely to make recommendations to the joint committee. One urgent task is to look at what goods will be subject to tariffs when crossing the Irish Sea using data on trade journeys and the goods \u201cat risk\u201d of entering the single market by crossing the border into the Republic of Ireland.</p> <h2>Border inspection posts</h2> <p>The location of border inspection posts for controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea has yet to be decided, unsurprisingly given Johnson has insisted there would be no checks. The EU would prefer posts to be located in places such as the ports of Liverpool and Cairnryan in Scotland.</p> <h2>Fisheries</h2> <p>This is one of the most contentious areas and the EU has said there will be no deal unless agreed in outline by June. The chances of progress in this week\u2019s talks have been hampered by the failure of the UK to issue a legal text giving detail to how it envisages its new status as an independent coastal state to work. The EU issued text for all areas but the UK issued a partial text. \u201cThis means the text the negotiating teams will be discussing is the EU\u2019s text, not the UK\u2019s,\u201d a source said.</p> <h2>Customs</h2> <p>Gove told parliament as recently as February that the UK needed an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/28/extra-50000-border-staff-needed-for-post-brexit-trade-says-gove\">army of 50,000 customs agents</a> to deal with cross-border trade from January 2021. It seem unlikely much progress has been made here.</p> <h2>Immigration</h2> <p>The immigration bill, which would have closed the borders to low-paid unskilled workers from January, has been shelved, the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced this week. Few believe the government can forge ahead with a change of public attitude to foreign low-paid workers in social care, health, retail and agriculture.</p> <h2>Hauliers</h2> <p>The Road Haulage Association has called for the transition period to be extended. It says the industry is on life support.</p> <p>\u201cWe are totally focused on coronavirus and our position is there is a real need for a delay to Brexit talks. Our industry is struggling to survive with more than 70% saying they face going to the wall within 12 weeks,\u201d said Rod McKenzie, head of policy and public affairs.</p> <p>He said a survey of 4,500 hauliers found half of drivers were inactive and 50% of trucks parked up.</p>",

I thought my friends were playing a joke on me \u2026 it was totally out of the blue,\u201d Jenny McGee told TVNZ.</p> <h2>Ecuador case toll much higher than previously published</h2> <p>Ecuador\u2019s health minister has said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-live-news-us-states-start-to-reopen-as-detained-wuhan-journalist-reappears?page=with:block-5ea211ac8f08eb2f433f570c#block-5ea211ac8f08eb2f433f570c\">country\u2019s coronavirus case total is twice as high as previously confirmed</a>, as authorities added 11,000 new infections that resulted from delayed testing.
