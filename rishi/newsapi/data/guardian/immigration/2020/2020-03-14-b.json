  "<p>The train. The pool. The \u201cdreaded tip truck\u201d. Every weekend dozens of kids, puffy faced and flushed, blow out the candles on a novelty birthday cake. Perhaps it\u2019s the same type of cake that, a generation ago, their parents blew on too.</p> <p>This year, the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly\u2019s Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book turns 40. But it took two years of wheedling, back in the late 1970s, to get the book made. Pamela Clark, one of the book\u2019s recipe developers, recalls that \u201cthe bosses, quite frankly, weren\u2019t that keen on the idea \u2026 They didn\u2019t really believe that it would sell its socks off.\u201d</p> <p>They could not have been more wrong. The book has sold more than half a million copies in Australia, and its 106 recipes have been birthday party staples ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fdfddd56029db6663c09a12b400a1abe494bc0be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdfddd56029db6663c09a12b400a1abe494bc0be/47_65_2416_1691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The test kitchen team responsible for the Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The test kitchen team responsible for the Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Australian Women's Weekly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been absolutely staggered,\u201d Clark says of the book\u2019s revered status. \u201cIt\u2019s quite embarrassing. At various gatherings I\u2019ve been to about this book, people arrive with copies under their arms for me to sign.</p> <p>\u201cHalf the pages are stuck together with buttercream and splattered with food colouring. It\u2019s been passed on from their grandmother ... It\u2019s reaching three generations at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>This year, as part of Melbourne Food and Wine festival, the book will be celebrated with an exhibition, Take the Cake.</p> <p>A lot has changed in the decades since the book was first published. Clark now fields calls from parents concerned that the Smarties that stud a 1-shaped cake are probably a choking hazard. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking \u2018I don\u2019t think a one-year-old is eating Smarties\u2019. It was a different world.\u201d</p> <p>Parents are far more cautious about sugar, gluten, additives and food colouring. \u201cI was often seen with green hands or pink hands,\u201d Clark jokes. On the other end of the spectrum, Instagram is flooded with cakes so elaborate, they could be sculptures.</p> <p>\u201cI find it fascinating, because at the high end of cake decorating that\u2019s all over the internet,\u201d says Clark. \u201cThen you get these \u2026 daggy cakes, which they are in this book, and they\u2019re more popular than all of the upmarket ones.\u201d She\u2019s even been sent photographs of a wedding where the bride and groom had a dozen or so cakes from the book in lieu of a traditional wedding cake.</p> <p>\u201cI remember all the meetings that we had struggling to think of things to do in the book,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe sat down and talked a lot. And I said \u2018what about a swimming pool cake\u2019 and they all looked at me like I was some kind of a crazy person.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d33330ec7b734829c388b6169a5d4256a7f8a189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d33330ec7b734829c388b6169a5d4256a7f8a189/0_0_2486_1953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A swimming pool cake from the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly\u2019s Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A swimming pool cake from the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly\u2019s Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Australian Women's Weekly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWater, blue, green, jelly. It seemed quite logical to me \u2026 I said \u2018look, a 20cm round cake is a very popular size cake pan. Everyone\u2019s got one of those tins.\u2019\u201d She convinced the team to let her trial one out in the test kitchen. \u201cThere was nothing fancy about it, it was a prototype.</p> <p>\u201cEllen Sinclair, who was the food editor at the time, said, \u2018let\u2019s shoot it little darling,\u2019 which is what she always said. The poor photographer was dragged in \u2026 we held up a few white boards and he took a happy snap, and that\u2019s the one in the book.\u201d</p> <p>One of the pleasures of cooking from the Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book is how simple, but effective, some of the ideas are.</p> <p>One of Clark\u2019s favourites, a Dolly Varden cake, is studded with pink and white marshmallows and topped with a legless Barbie. It came about because Clark didn\u2019t want \u201canything with fondant and piping and all that stuff\u201d. She thought to herself, \u201c\u2018what can I do that anyone can do\u2019 ...

We abused those chocolate sticks back in those days.\u201d</p> <p>Not all of the cakes are that simple, though. \u201cThere are half a dozen or so cakes in that book where I would advise people to stick the pages together so that the child does not see them, because they\u2019re hard work.\u201d</p> <p>A \u201cfluffy frosting\u201d (Italian meringue) covered castle with four pointed turrets ranks among the most challenging; while the train that sits on the book\u2019s cover can be tough when ambitious parents decide to add extra carriages. But a tip truck with <a href=\"https://goat.com.au/abc/the-author-of-the-womens-weekly-birthday-cake-cookbook-has-only-one-piece-of-advice-for-us-dont-even-bother-with-the-dump-truck/\">lollies spilling out of its back pallet</a> is the hardest ask.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had lots of phone calls about the tip truck and mothers who\u2019ve said \u2018I can\u2019t do it but my husband\u2019s an engineer, and you know what, he\u2019s doing an amazing job on the tip truck.\u2019\u201d She says figuring out how the support structures work is the most complicated part. \u201cWe just used skewers, but I don\u2019t know what an engineer would use.\u201d</p> <p>So, will we ever see another book like it? \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do the novelty cakes in the same way that we did back then,\u201d says Clark. \u201cForty years is a long time! I think there are higher expectations than there were back then.\u201d</p> <p>In the kitchen now, recipe writers and food stylists, even those interested in novelty cakes, don\u2019t \u201cwant their cakes to look daggy. And I got that. You can\u2019t replicate things all the time.

  "<p>When it comes to fighting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/polar-ice-caps-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-1990s\" title=\"\">climate change</a> and its effects, both greens and conservatives pay far too much attention to localism, voluntarism, and corporate responsibility. All are valuable; none are adequate. If, as many environmentalists say, the struggle against global heating requires a sense of wartime emergency, then fighting it while chiefly relying on these assets is as if Britain fought the Second World War relying on the Home Guard.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\" title=\"\">budget</a> contained some useful steps to limit carbon emissions; but they are far too small, and offset by road construction and the failure to lift the freeze on fuel taxes brought in 10 years ago. </p> <p>Climate change, if unchecked, threatens the destruction of Britain; yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/uk-takes-first-small-steps-to-tackle-carbon-from-worst-polluters\" title=\"\">new money</a> allocated to combat it is less than one fifteenth of the annual defence bill and well under half the cost of the two Royal Navy aircraft carriers \u2013 which increasingly seem to have no national strategic purpose.</p> <p>The best way of looking at the idea of state-led national <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">green new deals</a> is to see them as the latest episode in the 200-year-old history of efforts to save capitalism from itself. The difference is that in the past, unrestrained capitalism could only destroy one country\u2019s political and economic order. Today, by continuing to boost carbon emissions, it can destroy the whole of modern civilisation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before 2008, we know it now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout modern history, just as today, there have been capitalists, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, who have called for the reform of capitalism, whether from conscience or fear of revolution, but, in the end, parliaments still had to pass the laws and states had to implement them. If we had left it to capitalism to regulate itself, seven-year-olds would still be working down coal mines \u2013 or, more likely, Britain would have collapsed into communism. Capitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\" title=\"\">crash of 2008</a>, we certainly know it now.</p> <p>Central to the taming of capitalism has always been the creation of welfare states. Enhanced social security and state healthcare as part of any green new deal are essential to the fight to limit carbon emissions for three reasons: to compensate those workers and sections of society that will suffer as a result of the abandonment of fossil fuels; to make the necessary sacrifices politically possible by sharing those sacrifices through progressive taxation; and to build the social and national resilience which we will need if our democratic orders are to survive the shocks of the decades to come \u2013 including the spread of tropical diseases as a result of climate change.</p> <p>This need for social solidarity links the green new deal to the patriotic origins of the welfare state. Both conservatives and socialists have agreed in attributing the welfare state to socialism; conservatives because they have come to dislike it, the left because they want to claim all credit for it.</p> <p>In fact, the origins of the British welfare state lie very largely in the social imperialism movement in the years before 1914. The supporters of this movement were an extraordinarily varied bunch: H G Wells, George Bernard Shaw and Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the left; liberal imperialists such as Winston Churchill and William Beveridge; patriotic writers including Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle; imperial bureaucrats such as Lord Milner and John Buchan; and soldiers including Field Marshal Lord Roberts. Their thinking echoed, in key respects, Bismarck\u2019s social security programme in Germany and the reformist <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/12/06/archives-president-teddy-roosevelts-new-nationalism-speech\" title=\"\">\u201cnew nationalism\u201d </a>of Theodore Roosevelt in the US.</p> <p>As Lord Roberts declared: \u201cTo tens of thousands of Englishmen engaged in daily toil, the call to \u2018sacrifice\u2019 themselves for their country must seem an insult to their reason; for those conditions amid which they work make their lives already an unending sacrifice.\u201d</p> <p>What all these figures had in common was a fear of social disintegration and revolution; a belief (right or wrong) in the British Empire as a force for progress; and a belief that social solidarity, \u201cnational efficiency\u201d, and a degree of national self-sufficiency were essential to survive what they (correctly) saw would be the colossal social, economic and political strains of a new European war.</p> <p>My own thinking about this has also been shaped by my experience of working in Qatar, which has engaged in an intense and successful state-led effort at national self-sufficiency in response to the blockade by Saudi Arabia and other neighbours.</p> <p>The social imperialist tradition flowed into the later development of the welfare state as a result of the Second World War. In the course of these conflicts most of the Labour party became intensely patriotic, while the Conservatives became one-nation Tories, committed to social solidarity and state involvement in the economy.</p> <p>When, in 1960, Bernard Semmel wrote his classic study of social imperialism, Imperialism and Social Reform, he took for granted its victory on both sides of the political spectrum: \u201cToday, the Cobdenites [ie radical free-market liberals] and the international socialists are virtually extinct breeds.\u201d</p> <p>This is the spirit we need to recover in response to the climate emergency and associated menaces. International agreements and protest movements are valuable and necessary but they can\u2019t do anything themselves. Their purpose is to nudge and shame states into taking action. And state governments, in the end, take action on behalf of their national populations. That is their duty, and it is also what those populations expect and vote for.</p> <p>The task then is to mobilise patriotism by convincing national populations that global heating is a threat, not just to humanity and the planet but to the interests and the future survival of their own countries; and that society, as a whole, will pull together, alleviate suffering and make sacrifices as part of a common effort.</p> <p>If we can\u2019t manage this I very much doubt that liberal democracy will survive what is coming at us down the line.</p> <p>\u2022 Anatol Lieven is the author of Climate Change and the Nation State: The Realist Case</p>",

A fun day out at a family member\u2019s home turned terrifying when little Nicholas was pulled from the pool. He\u2019d been underwater for three minutes and it was touch and go.</p> <p>Paul remembers Lisa and him holding on to each other at the hospital for support. Then, when their son was out of intensive care, he watched as Lisa sat up all night watching over their child. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is the woman I\u2019m glad I married because this is such a steady supporting love,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI was very lucky to find someone who just showed so much courage and love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"459a7ed9b0e32e16c4be4b475036e314df515ef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459a7ed9b0e32e16c4be4b475036e314df515ef8/0_42_480_583/412.jpg\" alt=\"Paul &amp; Lisa Thomson in Merry Widow\" width=\"412\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul and Lisa Thomson in costume for a production of Merry Widow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul &amp; Lisa Thomson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sydney couple had been together for almost 20 years when that happened. They met in Brisbane in 1983 when they were in their 20s and contracted to sing in the Queensland Opera.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s first marriage had broken down and he was wary about getting involved with someone new, but when he spotted Lisa, he took that chance. At a Sunday afternoon garden party, they got talking. \u201cI must have talked to [her] for probably an hour, because she was beautiful. She still is beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we just talked \u2013 Lisa is a fantastic listener and I can be a fantastic talker.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, it was an easy match. \u201cThe music was there to bind us because we loved singing in the opera,\u201d says Lisa. They performed together in Fidelio, Cavalleria Rusticana, Pagliacci and The Merry Widow. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an opera company or a theatre company, you just have so much fun. Even rehearsals \u2026 because you really get to know one another.\u201d And while they were in a competitive industry, there was no professional jealousy between them. \u201cWhen you\u2019re singing, you\u2019ve got different voice types anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Lisa. \u201cBut for some of the relationships we knew that started right back there, those marriages haven\u2019t lasted.\u201d</p> <p>For Lisa, there was something else too. He was her first serious boyfriend and she sensed his vulnerability. \u201cHe had a good sense of humour, he didn\u2019t take himself too seriously [but] he needed to be looked after. I think that\u2019s something that I wanted too, I wanted to look after somebody. Reflecting back now, I can really see that in myself.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/01/how-we-stay-together-our-friends-call-us-the-couple-who-forgot-to-break-up\">How we stay together: our friends call us 'the couple who forgot to break up'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the next six months, their relationship developed and they moved in together in Brisbane. Then Paul was offered a scholarship to study opera in London. Both were keen but there was a catch. Paul\u2019s previous relationship with a performer had been torn apart by rivalry. \u201cI said to Lisa, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work again for me personally if you want to go there and study, and we go down the same path. [It] didn\u2019t work for me before.\u2019\u201d And immediately, Lisa said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll stop. You follow your goals, your love.\u2019 That\u2019s why we\u2019re still together because she made this enormous sacrifice.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision for Lisa. As much as she enjoyed music, she wasn\u2019t prepared to sacrifice everything for it, and she was happy to work while Paul studied. \u201cIt was a big adventure to go to London ... I thought, \u2018Oh well, I\u2019m happy to go along for the ride.\u2019 And I was happy to be with someone and look after them.\u201d</p> <p>In London, the couple were young, in love and having a great time, travelling and exploring Europe. But it was lonely at times and money was tight \u2013 even though Lisa was working in all sorts of jobs. \u201cI worked in a newsagent, I ran a carpet cleaning company, I sold Elna presses and sewing machines in John Lewis in Oxford Street.\u201d Being far from home meant they relied on each other for friendship and support and drew them even closer together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0b429e64f25aa2f2058e512b3956c0a65a82f3c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b429e64f25aa2f2058e512b3956c0a65a82f3c5/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Paul &amp; Lisa Thomson on their wedding day in November 1984\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul and Lisa Thomson on their wedding day in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul &amp; Lisa Thomson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They decided to get married. Paul remembers a particular moment in a bookshop. \u201cThere was a book on the history of opera, a very expensive book. And I said, \u2018I wonder should I buy this book when you already have it?\u2019\u201d And she said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to need to buy another one darling\u2019 [and] I felt that she really loved me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lisa felt the same way about him. \u201cI\u2019m interested in lots of different things and [I remember thinking], \u2018I just don\u2019t want to be in a boring relationship.\u2019 I wanted someone who had the same values, had integrity and loyalty, who when they said they were going to do something, they would. And Paul is very, very much like that.\u201d</p> <p>Their November 1984 wedding was a simple affair in a registry office on the corner of their street. Lisa made her own wedding dress on one of those Elna sewing machines. It was a great selling point. \u201c[Customers] would go, \u2018Oh, what are you making?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018My wedding dress.\u2019 So it was a good way to flog the product,\u201d she says with a laugh. </p> <p>After about five years in London, they returned home. \u201cIf we were going to have kids, we always wanted to come back to have them in Australia.\u201d Still they wanted to put down their roots first, so they bought their first home and waited until they both had jobs before Lisa could take maternity leave.</p> <p>Despite their plans, when their two children Phoebe and Nicholas were born, they had to change again. \u201cPaul couldn\u2019t wait to have kids. For him, that was quite a stabilising thing as much as kids drive you crazy but it did mean that Paul ended up sacrificing. [He] was an at-home dad, which enabled me to go back to work and keep supporting the family,\u201d says Lisa. \u201cThat was a bit shattering for Paul because it meant he couldn\u2019t sing and work in the opera companies perhaps as much as he wanted to.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/23/how-we-stay-together-we-debate-absolutely-everything-but-we-fight-fair\">How we stay together: we debate absolutely everything \u2013 but we fight fair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Becoming a stay at home dad and teaching singing part-time wasn\u2019t an easy shift, Paul agrees: \u201cThose seven or eight years, until they were old enough to go to school were very difficult years. I was at home running a small business ... I got more and more work [and] opportunities and I was like the part-time mum at home trying to juggle all those things when Lisa went back to work.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back, they wish they\u2019d taken more time for themselves at the time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anyone who would offer to look after the kids.

You can\u2019t just forge down your own path, my way or the highway. Not for our relationship, it doesn\u2019t work like that for us,\u201d says Lisa.</p> <p>And they\u2019re very affectionate with each other, frequently saying \u2018I love you\u2019. \u201cI come from quite an affectionate family, we\u2019re very touchy,\u201d says Paul \u201cand Lisa doesn\u2019t. But very quickly I realised that she yearned for the same thing \u2026 We show that affection without any problem. We kiss and we hug and we still do it.\u201d</p> <p>The couple are going through another transition now that Lisa has retired. Having her at home all day was an adjustment for Paul. \u201cI had a nice little sort of fiefdom at home here and I wasn\u2019t too sure how it would work out,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cTo Lisa\u2019s credit, she\u2019s formed a whole new lifestyle and routine being at home ...

We enjoy nature, we enjoy the birds, we enjoy being outside.\u201d</p> <p>For Lisa, it means making him a cup of tea each night. \u201cI teach at night, I teach downstairs and I come up [at 8.30],\u201d says Paul. \u201cAnd I look over and Lisa\u2019s waiting for me with a cup of tea and my biscuit is there.\u201d He always tells her how much it means to him. \u201cShe knows that that simple act, that cup of tea, it\u2019s a simple thing but it\u2019s the sign of your love and devotion.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>We want to hear your stories about staying together.

  "<p>For artist and writer Charlotte Amelia Poe, 30, every day feels like a walk across a frozen pond. \u201cIt\u2019s how it\u2019s always been,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to navigate it and stay safe, but you\u2019re aware that at any moment the ice is likely to crack, and at that point you will sink into the water.\u201d</p> <p>The worst of it is that, when she feels that way, she has no idea how she can avoid going under. \u201cYou think you\u2019re doing fine and you\u2019re treading carefully enough not to crack the ice. But suddenly you\u2019ve gone under. You\u2019ve got it completely wrong \u2013 and you\u2019ve no idea why.\u201d</p> <p>Poe is describing how it feels to be autistic. She wants the rest of us to understand, she says, because it really matters, perhaps more than it\u2019s ever mattered (of which more later). Her mission to break open the mystery of how it feels to be autistic has already been impressively successful: last year she won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">Spectrum </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">art </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">prize</a> for her video piece <em>How </em><em>To </em><em>Be Autistic</em> and recently she wrote a book of the same name. Her hope is that, by opening up about her own journey through childhood, school and adolescence, she can change other people\u2019s perceptions and expectations about what autism is like, from the inside.</p> <p>We are talking in the sitting room of the semi-detached house overlooking a Suffolk field that Poe shares with three generations of her family. She has never left home and doesn\u2019t expect to; her nephews and niece are playing outside in the garden, and one day their mother, her sister, will be her carer in the way that her parents are at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scary feeling, that I\u2019ll be inherited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019d be very lonely if I had to live alone. I need people around me. I like noise and I like being surrounded by people I love.\u201d She\u2019s curled up on the sofa as we speak, her legs tucked underneath her, looking fragile and bird-like, but her voice is surprisingly strong, as well as impressively articulate.</p> <p>Poe was just six or seven years old and at primary school when she realised she was different. Astonishingly, it wasn\u2019t until she was 21 that she received a diagnosis of autism. The reason, she says, is simple \u2013 society looks for autism in boys, not girls, and the way it presents means that boys are more likely to be identified with it. \u201cAutistic children are often quiet and obedient when they\u2019re very young \u2013 and if you\u2019re a girl, that\u2019s not unusual. But for a boy it is. If I\u2019d been a boy I\u2019d have been diagnosed years sooner.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People with autism get what others are feeling to a huge degree</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That rankles, because at school she knew autistic boys and they had an easier time of it because they had a label \u2013 \u201cSometimes labels can be really helpful,\u201d she says \u2013 and she describes how she was increasingly seen as awkward by her teachers, some of whom bullied her as much as some of her fellow pupils did.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d been diagnosed sooner,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had the level of trauma I\u2019ve had. It makes me angry that I have to deal with extra baggage that could have been avoided.\u201d</p> <p>It was people\u2019s attitude towards her, rather than the condition itself, that made life so unbearable. \u201cUnderstanding is so important \u2013 that\u2019s what makes a real difference,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need trained people to support us, and there aren\u2019t enough of them \u2013 and although there\u2019s been more awareness of autism in the past few years, it\u2019s not filtered through into proper training. My brother is a doctor and I think he spent one day on it in his entire time at medical school.\u201d</p> <p>There are so many misunderstandings, she says. To take just one, autistic people are <em>not</em> unable to empathise. \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing, but people with autism get what others are feeling to a huge degree. It overwhelms us \u2013 that\u2019s why we often don\u2019t know how to respond, how to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>One focus of her difficulties, for several years, was her teeth. From the time they began to wobble she was unable to brush them. She\u2019s not sure why she found the loss of her milk teeth so disturbing, but she speculates that it may have been because \u201cautistic people are extremely sensitive to sensation, to change, to pain\u201d. The net result: \u201cI went through the entirety of first school and half of middle school with a mouth full of disgusting, stinking plaque.\u201d Although her teeth are fine now, she tries not to show them when she\u2019s talking or smiling.</p> <p>Having terrible teeth was one of the many things that made Poe stick out as different. She also had a tendency to vomit in public when her anxiety became too much to cope with (she ended up carrying a sick bowl around with her wherever she went, just in case). She was a picky eater and was unable to eat even a packed lunch at school \u2013 and she spent more and more time on her own in her bedroom.</p> <p>Academically she did well, although once homework got serious she found it increasingly difficult to tackle (\u201cThat\u2019s called executive dysfunction \u2013 you know you should do something, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to do it\u201d) and that led to her being seen as difficult.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t have the same filter and that makes us powerful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, she started playing up to her profile. \u201cYou think, if I\u2019m going to be seen as this, then it might help to just be it.\u201d But as things would turn out, it was embracing her sense of \u201cotherness\u201d that led to a way forward, and gradually, being \u201cdifferent\u201d became something she celebrated, rather than hid.</p> <p>She turned her attention to something she says is deeply ingrained in the autistic psyche \u2013 fandom. From <em>Harry Potter</em> to <em>Captain America</em>, she became a groupie, attending conventions and dressing up as her favourite characters. It felt like a liberation. \u201cFandom conventions are full of people with autism,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re somewhere we can be unashamedly who we are.\u201d That\u2019s because hyperfixation, she says, is both the best and the worst thing about being autistic. \u201cYou become very fixated on something \u2013 it\u2019s very helpful when you\u2019re working on a project, like writing a book for example, because you can write 20,000 words in a day. But it has very negative connotations for others \u2013 people who are over-enthusiastic about stuff are written off as \u201cautistic\u201d \u2013 and that devalues your opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Today Poe looks as different as she feels. Her arms and legs are covered in tattoos and, on the day I meet her, her hair is dyed blonde with hues of light pink and pale blue. Being autistic still limits her life \u2013 agoraphobia means she only manages to leave the house once or twice a month, and she has to take tranquillisers first \u2013 but stumbling on the existence of the Spectrum art prize for people with autism, and then making the winning video, changed her life.</p> <p>She\u2019d like to become a fiction writer, and is currently working on her first novel \u2013 but she\u2019s also committed to telling it like it is about autism. And that matters because, she says, autistic people, once diagnosed and understood, have great potential \u2013 they\u2019re often very effective individuals who can make a noise and a difference. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same filter as neurotypical people and that can make us powerful and strong,\u201d she says. \u201cLook at the environmental campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>, for example.\u201d</p> <p>And there\u2019s more, she says, because we live in a time when people who are \u201cother\u201d are increasingly dismissed, cut out of the action \u2013 and those with autism, who naturally identify as outsiders, can be effective champions for all outsiders. \u201cWe really get what it means to not fit in. And with the rise of populist politics and an insular society, at a time when the notion of \u2018us versus them\u2019 is increasingly common, people with autism have really important viewpoints and experiences to share.\u201d</p> <p>Her most important point, though, is also her simplest. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like people to take away from my experience, that would help others with autism, it\u2019s this: be kind,\u201d she says. \u201cKindness is underrated. You don\u2019t need to know their story, you just need to think about being friendly and helping, rather than deciding they\u2019re strange or worthless and moving on fast. A little bit of kindness can make the world of a difference to someone who\u2019s struggling.\u201d</p> <p><em>How to be Autistic by Charlotte Amelia Poe </em><em> (Myriad Editions, \u00a38.99) is available for \u00a37.55 from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-be-autistic-9781912408320.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p>",
  "<p>You see the most remarkable skies here \u2013 like a miracle of heaven and earth together,\u201d says artist <a href=\"https://rachaeldickens.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rachael Dickens</a> of the view from her newly built home, between Herne Bay and Reculver on the Kent coast. A keen outdoor swimmer whose work is often inspired by water, Rachael was first drawn to this site by its setting. \u201cI walk on the beach and swim in the sea nearly every day,\u201d she says, \u201cand the vision for the house was very much about being able to see the sea.\u201d The result is an arresting contemporary home whose jet-black weatherboarding and corrugated roof echo the tarred fishermen\u2019s huts and net lofts typically found in nearby Whitstable.</p> <p>Rachael came across the plot by accident during a day trip to Whitstable with her sister in 2014. At the time, she was house-hunting without success in south London, after selling her home in Sydenham with a view to moving closer to <a href=\"https://www.fusion-lifestyle.com/centres/brockwell-lido/\" title=\"\">Brockwell </a><a href=\"https://www.fusion-lifestyle.com/centres/brockwell-lido/\" title=\"\">lido</a>. (Rachael has been cold water swimming since 2006 and helped to reform the lido\u2019s original 1930s swimming club: The Brockwell Icicles.) While walking along the east Kent coastline, looping back from Reculver, the sisters stumbled across a small 1930s bungalow for sale right by the shore, but it was in need of modernisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fde763a4adf1352a84de1908593e32ffbf25162\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fde763a4adf1352a84de1908593e32ffbf25162/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old meets new: the kitchen cupboards from the original bungalow were retained and repainted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old meets new: the kitchen cupboards from the original bungalow were retained and repainted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Hemming/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a nice house, but it had the most fantastic views and quite a big garden, so I knew I could build a studio at the back,\u201d Rachael recalls. \u201cAnd because I had done some building work before, I could imagine how it could be refurbished.\u201d She quickly made an offer and moved in that October.</p> <p>As her original intention had been to remodel the house, Rachael commissioned a local architect, <a href=\"http://parashoot-architects.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Michael Shoobridge</a>, to draw up plans for a fresh internal layout. However, when builders began work in 2015, it became clear that the bungalow\u2019s timber frame was perilously rotten and it would have to be knocked down. \u201cI was a bit terrified \u2013 but excited as well \u2013 when I found out about the demolition,\u201d says Rachael, who has two grown-up children still living in London, and shares her home with a Staffordshire terrier cross named Zoot. \u201cIt did make it a lot more expensive.\u201d A buy-to-let flat she had just purchased in Westgate-on-Sea had to be sold to pay for the project. Meanwhile, Michael Shoobridge revised his plans to create a new timber-framed building, designed around Rachael\u2019s twin passions for the outdoors and art.</p> <p>Having already set up a studio in the garden (built by Homestead Garden Rooms, complete with shower), Rachael made this her home for a year as she project-managed the construction. \u201cMy aunt, uncle and cousin were all architects; my dad built concrete and steel structures as a civil engineer and my grandfather was the son in the building firm Bailey, Dickens &amp; Son, so I have a lineage of ideas about form, structure and materials,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt was fun \u2013 and I had every faith in the builders.\u201d The finished two-bedroom house, built by Chris Dew at <a href=\"https://www.sanris.co.uk/\" title=\"\">San Ris</a>, is ideally suited to her way of life. The ground floor has floor-to-ceiling windows to the front and rear, so that from her garden workspace she can look straight through the house and out to the sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a65ffc488650ad718beeb8338d040fc78679c07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a65ffc488650ad718beeb8338d040fc78679c07/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rooms with a view: the ground floor has floor-to-ceiling windows to the front and rear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rooms with a view: the ground floor has floor-to-ceiling windows to the front and rear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Hemming/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vaulted, open-plan living room and kitchen is painted white and has a pale plywood floor, making the most of the natural light. To keep within budget, the kitchen cupboards from the original bungalow were retained and repainted, then teamed with a reclaimed timber worktop from a school science lab. Rachael\u2019s collections of vintage finds and contemporary art, displayed on midcentury Ladderax and G-Plan units or floating shelves, lend vibrant colour to the decorative scheme. Some of her own paintings appear here, and throughout the house, alongside works by south London artists <a href=\"https://elizabeth-chisholm.business.site/\" title=\"\">Liz Chisholm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.christophernoulton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Christopher Noulton</a>, plus cushions by weaver <a href=\"https://www.margoselby.com/\" title=\"\">Margo Selby</a>, whose studio is in Whitstable. A restored pinball machine, from <a href=\"http://scottsmargate.co.uk/\" title=\"\">RG Scott\u2019s</a> antiques emporium in Margate, adds a jaunty touch.</p> <p>The theme of seaside nostalgia continues into the snug, \u2013 a second sitting room, tucked away on the ground floor \u2013 where kitsch curios, such as antique shell art, nautical embroideries and 1960s ceramics, are displayed against a warm backdrop of unpainted plaster. Rachael\u2019s wit and creativity are further in evidence in the downstairs bathroom, inspired by the house of architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ng-interactive/2020/jan/12/art-into-nature-nature-into-art-cesar-manrique-the-architect-of-lanzarote\" title=\"\">C\u00e9sar Manrique</a> on Lanzarote, which opens out on to the garden. Rachael sourced some potato crates from <a href=\"http://www.quexpark.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Quex Park</a> in Birchington and, in exchange for a donation, broke them up to use as cladding for the bath and WC. \u201cAll that white porcelain is really boring,\u201d she smiles. A lid made from a salvaged door conceals the bath when not in use.</p> <p>The first-floor bedroom gives a sense of being afloat on an ocean liner, with its generous glass-sided balcony, beside which stands a stack of time-worn leather suitcases. From the bed, the marine outlook extends across the front garden, which is filled with hardy, salt-resistant plants, interwoven with items found on the beach, such as a totemic driftwood pillar, which Rachael thinks was once part of Herne Bay pier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bea81e7f0266d943fc97ff78dac805d42df8eb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bea81e7f0266d943fc97ff78dac805d42df8eb2/0_59_5616_3539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I find scraps of cloth on the beach and wonder how far they have travelled\u2019: Rachael Dickens in her studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I find scraps of cloth on the beach and wonder how far they have travelled\u2019: Rachael Dickens in her studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Hemming/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Currently, her artwork is prompted by the surprising things she discovers washed ashore. \u201cI find scraps of cloth, which were obviously once clothing, and it makes me wonder whose clothes they were and how far they have travelled through the tumbling oceans to land on my beach.\u201d These fragments are then incorporated into stitched-cloth pieces, evoking human vulnerability, which have featured in exhibitions across Kent. In addition to a recent series of ceramics exploring the experiences of displaced families, she makes silver boat and bronze anchor pendants in support of Kent Refugee Action Network.</p> <p>Following her move, Rachael quickly became involved in the Whitstable arts scene and opens her doors every autumn for <a href=\"https://ekoh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">East Kent Open Houses</a> to welcome admirers of both her work and unique home. Among her future plans for the property is an extension across the back, to create a third bedroom and yoga studio. A trained yoga teacher in both Sivananda and Kundalini, Rachael spends time in India, continuing her practice.</p> <p>The artist considers her regular sea swims, accompanied by Zoot, also to be a meditation. \u201cMoving here has been the best thing ever,\u201d she confirms. \u201cJust getting out into the open so calms the spirit. Swimming daily is a fantastic ritual.

  "<p>Running through Manhattan from the Battery to the Bronx, Broadway is New York City\u2019s lifeline.

But as I make my way uptown, coronavirus\u2019s impact on small businesses becomes clear.</p> <p>At Thai Street Food, a food truck outside Trinity Church, co-owner Sony Ramirez, 35, from Queens, says business has dropped by 50% because many offices have closed. The truck\u2019s one waiting customer chimes in: \u201cNormally I see a line here. Today I\u2019m the only one.\u201d</p> <p>Ramirez adds: \u201cI\u2019m worried because I have to work.

Sayed Sadat, 52, who works at a bagel and lunch truck, is packing away after a deathly quiet morning. A huge bin of uneaten bagels stands next to the truck.</p> <p>\u201cI came at 4.30am and nobody [came] until 6am. Business is no good. No business at all.\u201d</p> <p>Disaster also looms for the souvenir sellers. On a corner near Fulton Street, where shoals of tourists usually pass on the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, Tiger Diop, wearing a feathered \u201chappy new year\u201d headband, sits, his merchandise unbought.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make a living,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s suffering now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69/0_58_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By city hall, a small group of climate protesters stand with a big \u201cFridays for Future\u201d flag. The street is so quiet that birdsong is audible from the gardens.</p> <p>As I reach the Tribeca neighbourhood, the sun comes out. It seems to bring more pedestrians. But John, 55, a souvenir seller dressed in a white surgical mask and a New York police department cap, says the street is considerably quieter than usual. He has started selling latex gloves and alcohol disinfectant but he says it\u2019s hand sanitizer people want \u2013 a commodity impossible to track down. A nearby convenience store has a sign in the window: \u201cMasks sold here.\u201d</p> <p>In Soho, Steff Bradley, 23, a graphic designer, and student Wilson Chiu, 25, are on their way to the bank. Bradley is wearing a mask. She says she felt short of breath this morning and is so anxious about coronavirus that she \u201chad a panic attack over a runny nose\u201d. As we speak, she reprimands Chiu, who says he is not concerned about the virus, for touching his face.</p> <p>I veer off Broadway for Chinatown, where Kong Wah Bakery\u2019s manager, Sam Chung, says business is down by 50% and staff are working half-days.</p> <p>Near New York University, which recently moved all classes online, I speak to a group of computer science students who agree the area has \u201cdefinitely got a different vibe\u201d.</p> <p>In Washington Square it becomes clear that just about everybody is talking about one thing: coronavirus. Disrupted travel arrangements, whether or not to go to a party, cleaning techniques, how much food they\u2019ve got stocked up.</p> <p>In Union Square, everything seems reassuringly normal \u2013 people are playing chess at tables, there\u2019s music, the farmers\u2019 market is on. But things take an apocalyptic turn when I spot a man in a full respirator mask and eye shield inspecting potatoes at a vegetable stand. The man, who doesn\u2019t want to be named, says he is in his 70s and on medication and fears for his health.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not normal times,\u201d he says, in muffled tones.</p> <p>At Madison Square Park it looks like everybody working from home has taken the opportunity to take their pet to the dog area and enjoy the sun.

It launched a <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/pornhub-bee-movie-aqua-conservation.html\">BeeSexual channel</a> to benefit honeybee conservation efforts; it ran a tree-planting scheme called Pornhub Gives America Wood; it tried to clean up plastic-filled beaches with a campaign called <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/45764/1/pornhub-wants-to-save-the-oceans-with-its-dirtiest-porn-ever-campaign\">Dirtiest Porn Ever</a>.</p> <p>While Pornhub has clearly given a lot of thought to smutty pun-based philanthropy, it doesn\u2019t seem to have put quite as much effort into ensuring its own business practices are ethical. The site is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/worlds-biggest-porn-site-under-fire-over-videos-pornhub\">currently facing serious allegations</a> of profiting from videos of rape and sexual abuse. Almost half a million people have signed <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/shut-down-pornhub-and-hold-its-executives-accountable-for-aiding-trafficking\">an online petition</a>, started by a group called Exodus Cry in the US, demanding that Pornhub be shut down and its executives held accountable for sex trafficking.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a company that is generating millions in advertising and membership revenue and yet they do not have an effective system in place to verify reliably the age or consent of those featured in the pornographic content it hosts,\u201d the Exodus Cry founder said.</p> <p>Pornhub vehemently disagrees. In a recent statement to the Guardian, the company said it \u201chas a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate\u201d.</p> <p>There have been rather a lot of suggestions otherwise. Kate Isaacs, the founder of Not Your Porn campaign, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/pornhub-needs-to-change-or-shut-down\">recently wrote a Guardian op-ed</a> detailing how she\u2019d worked with \u201c50 women who were turned into \u2018porn stars\u2019 without their permission\u201d. Isaacs notes that some of these women were under 18 \u201cwhen videos of them were posted on Pornhub without their consent\u201d. It took Pornhub weeks to get a video of one of Isaacs\u2019 friends removed; \u201cWhen one video had been removed, an identical video with her full name attached would pop back up again.\u201d</p> <p>Pornhub claims that it is simple for victims of non-consensual porn to request that videos be removed from its website; flagged videos are then \u201cfingerprinted\u201d to prevent future uploads. A <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9393zp/how-pornhub-moderation-works-girls-do-porn\">recent investigation by Motherboard</a> (part of Vice), however, found that this system can be easily circumvented. The investigation notes that Pornhub\u2019s current method for removing non-consensual porn \u201cnot only puts the onus of finding and flagging videos almost entirely on potentially-traumatized victims \u2013 those victims can\u2019t even rely on the system to work\u201d.</p> <p>While Pornhub may argue it has a \u201csteadfast commitment\u201d to eradicating non-consensual content, there\u2019s clearly a lot of room for it to do better.

Scudamore has recently written <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/0/dark-side-of-boarding-school/\" title=\"\">a non</a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/0/dark-side-of-boarding-school/\" title=\"\">fiction essay</a> about his own experiences at a prep boarding school \u2013 many of which, such as being sent out into the snow to defecate on his first day, are closely reproduced in the novel.</p> <p>Max Denyer is the first-person protagonist. His father and mother live abroad. He must part from his beloved grandfather and go to the school \u201con the hill\u201d, where he is soon subject to a beating from the headmaster with a \u201cgnarling, wizarding cudgel\u201d. At first Max cries constantly, but is ignored. He makes three main friends \u2013 Simon, Luke and Ish. The teachers include Wagstaff (\u201capoplectic\u201d) and Spinks (\u201cwhacking boys round the head with his metre rules\u201d), but the narrative focuses on \u201cWeapons\u201d Davis and most of all on Crimble, who is the novel\u2019s most unnerving and macabre creation. We return to Max, his friends, their families and Crimble in the decades after they leave the school.</p> <p>As one of Scudamore\u2019s epigrams has it: \u201cEnergy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another.\u201d And the novel is indeed a raw study in effects, after-effects and forever-effects. Max himself is not sexually abused, but many of those around him are. Thus the book comes to be about love and tragedy, about male bonds and gay friendship, as much as it is about cruelty and rage and the stark unavailability of parents to their children.</p> <p><em>English Monsters</em> is also concerned with puncturing what Scudamore refers to in his essay as the \u201centitlement illusion\u201d \u2013 the feeling of superiority that \u201cacts as compensation for the loss of childhood and the inability to empathise\u201d. And it is in this sense that the book generates its wider resonances: because, of course, it is impossible to read these pages and not to think of the present blight of emotionally cauterised boarding-school politicians whose various pathologies, fantasies and defence mechanisms Britain must continue to endure.</p> <p>I have always disliked the phrase \u201ckill your darlings\u201d because it reads to me as a clumsy attack on the poetic spirit, and I am a fan of the kind of ambitious fiction where words are weighed and piloted with precision. Just before Max falls in a frozen pond, for example, Scudamore writes: \u201cThe shimmer you hear in railway lines when a train is coming. That high tremble. Cracking ice has its tone.\u201d Or of the headmaster\u2019s wife: \u201cShe was one of those Englishwomen whose pride is indexed to their acidity.\u201d</p> <p>But, all the same, Scudamore is a victim of his own observational acuity and his darlings are a shade too copious: I would feel myself being asked to concentrate on some nuance of extraneous description when all around me raged the iniquities of the subject matter. I preferred the kinesis of his electric scene-writing \u2013 the adult encounter in a west London flat between Max and Simon; adult Max\u2019s near-unbearable meeting with Crimble at his cottage. Most skilful of all was the dark, artistic achievement of Crimble\u2019s letters to Simon, which reached right into the heart-mind sickness of the monster himself.</p> <p>These are matters of contention and taste, though. The main endeavour of such fiction is to invoke our horror and our understanding; to render the dense and knotted contours of pain and shame and guilt in the hearts of the victims; to summon up the monsters \u2013 and Scudamore manages these tasks with commendable imaginative skill and honesty.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Edward Docx\u2019s Let Go My Hand is published by Picador.

  "<p>Lawyers and campaigners have called for hundreds immigration centres detainees to be released because of fears they will contract coronavirus while locked up.</p> \n<p>The call is outlined in a letter from 10 organisations that advocate for migrants and human rights. It says that \u201cthere is a very real risk of an uncontrolled outbreak of Covid-19 in immigration detention\u201d.</p> \n<p>The letter comes as the BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51879952\">reported</a> that the government was drawing up emergency plans to avoid disruption in England\u2019s prisons. Its advice to prisons says inmates who have had contact with a known coronavirus patient should be isolated in single accommodation. Prison staff will be offered bonuses to cover shortages.</p> \n<p>The BBC says it understands the government\u2019s plans involve communicating regularly with inmates, making sure they can contact their families and providing books and magazines to those in isolation to alleviate boredom. It is unclear whether vulnerable prisoners may be released because of the particular health risks they face if they contract the coronavirus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

  "<p>Back in 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/steven-appleby\" title=\"\">Steven Appleby </a>inadvertently outed himself in a comic strip about a cross-dressing superhero saving fashion victims from pinstripes and overalls. The strip, published in the Guardian, brought \u201cDragman\u201d swooping down to earth in a mauve ballgown and yellow wig. Although Appleby had been out for several years to his close friends and family, he realises now that the new character embodied an urge to go further. \u201cI\u2019d had enough of leading a double life. Cross-dressing in secret once or twice a week felt dishonest and stifling,\u201d recalls the 64-year-old artist. \u201cI\u2019d learned to be comfortable with being a transvestite and now I was desperate to live as one.\u201d</p> <p>Eighteen years later,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\">Dragman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\"> </a>is back as the star of his own book. His adventures take him from the tip of the Shard to a fetish club deep beneath London\u2019s railway arches, on the trail of a serial killer who specialises in murdering transvestites. But before he can solve the crimes he has first to overcome the enmity of a superhero community that is not only transphobic but has banned any rescue that is not strictly covered by insurance. By instinctively saving a young girl as she plummets off a rooftop, Dragman has outlawed himself.</p> <p>Appleby created the book at his studio on a busy south London street, where he opens the door to a colourful gathering. His wife, Nicola Sherring \u2013 to whom he remains married though they separated many years ago \u201cas a biblical couple\u201d \u2013 is sharing a sandwich with Charlie, a scarlet cockatoo, who sits on her shoulder, watched jealously by Una, an accident-prone one-eyed pug (named from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/31/edward-gorey-book-jacket-design-contribution-unique-era-publishing\" title=\"\">Edward Gorey</a>\u2019s <em>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</em> \u2013 \u201cU is for Una who slipped down a drain\u201d). Sherring is responsible for colouring the book while Charlie plays a bit part in it, swooping around a conservatory. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t meant to be in it at all, but Nicola sneaked him in, says Appleby, \u201cso I had to redraw a whole spread.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship between fiction and autobiography is seldom as delicately nuanced as it is in Appleby\u2019s protagonists. Like Dragman\u2019s alter ego August, he discovered his transvestism after trying on a woman\u2019s stocking that he found down the back of a sofa at the age of 19. Like August\u2019s long-suffering wife Mary, Sherring was a carpenter when the couple met. \u201cShe came to make bookshelves for my flat and we just got on so well that I kept finding more jobs for her to do, and then we fell in love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbda27177f71edb4184bafd52651c734e6f248c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbda27177f71edb4184bafd52651c734e6f248c1/817_1075_1168_816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dragman to the rescue \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dragman to the rescue \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mmckay/Steven Appleby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While August keeps his secret locked up in boxes in the attic, Appleby was honest with Sherring from the start \u2013 even though he admits that their marriage involved a certain amount of denial. \u201cI assumed my other issues would fade into the background or even go away, because I certainly hadn\u2019t fallen in love ever before. And so I thought, wow this is amazing, maybe it\u2019s the antidote.\u201d</p> <p>Sherring already had two sons and they had two more together. When their younger boys were nearring the end of primary school, Appleby felt he had to tell them. \u201cI was feeling increasingly itchy about it \u2013 not depressed, but just kind of incomplete,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be a joined-up person and I also didn\u2019t want to have this secret from the family and particularly from my boys.\u201d With a couple of friends, he and Sherring went off to a wig shop. \u201cI wanted something short, so people wouldn\u2019t notice a change, but then I put on this style (he pats his trademark black bob), and all of them said, \u2018that\u2019s the one\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Back home, his sons \u201cdidn\u2019t bat an eyelid. They were probably watching TV or playing computer games.\u201d On a car journey to their Northumberland holiday cottage a while later, a school friend started moaning about how embarrassing her parents were. \u201cI said to them \u2018What must I be like?\u2019 And they replied \u2018Oh no, Dad, you\u2019re not embarrassing at all. You don\u2019t wear lace dresses to school like you do at night.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The cottage, which used to belong to Appleby\u2019s mother, provides a link to his childhood, which was spent in a leaky old vicarage near the Scottish border. He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the oldest of four children. His mother was Canadian and his father worked for his family\u2019s quarrying firm, which was slowly going bust. After a local Church of England primary school, where he won prizes for plasticine modelling, he boarded at a Quaker school from the age of 11. \u201cI loathed it to begin with, but in the end I wouldn\u2019t wish it away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that mixed thing, because I have huge respect for the Quakers and I still have friends from school.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"590cb3fa8387be9571534b4095e6fb07a53bd629\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590cb3fa8387be9571534b4095e6fb07a53bd629/35_26_2154_3009/716.jpg\" alt=\"Appleby was tutored by Quentin Blake: \u2018He taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality\u2019\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appleby was tutored by Quentin Blake: \u2018He taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mmckay/Steven Appleby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He hung out in the art room and got involved in a band, going on to do art and design at Manchester Polytechnic, \u201cmainly because I found art fun, and because my academic subjects weren\u2019t brilliant\u201d. The experience delivered an existential shock. \u201cSuddenly I found lots of people could draw much better than me.\u201d He dropped out for a while to join a band, before returning to do graphic design at Newcastle Polytechnic, followed by illustration at the Royal College of Art, where he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/29/inside-the-magical-world-of-quentin-blake\" title=\"\">tutored by Quentin Blake</a>. \u201cHe taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality. You can draw a car really badly, as long as it has the spirit of a car.\u201d He flips the book open on a sweetly wonky green Mini, in which Dragman tootles around when he is being August.</p> <p>This revelation didn\u2019t entirely cure his sense of inadequacy, and he took a job at a design firm, Assorted iMaGes, founded by a college friend,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2017/oct/20/buzzcocks-orgasm-addict-sleeve-revisted-punk\" title=\"\"> Malcolm Garrett</a>. Together they ran high-profile campaigns for bands such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/12/how-buzzcocks-invented-indie-with-help-from-the-sex-pistols-a-renault-and-the-quo\" title=\"\">Buzzcocks</a> and Duran Duran. \u201cMalcolm would design the album covers and I\u2019d do the other things like playing cards or bubblegum cards. It was fun, but after a few years I got frustrated, because you\u2019re doing it for other people.\u201d</p> <p>One of the first characters he created was Captain Star, an obsolete astronaut stranded on a distant planet with an outsized ego, who was invented for a strip in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/07/farewell-to-nme-rocknroll-riot-that-petered-into-silence\" title=\"\">New Musical Express</a> and went on to become the star of a TV animation series voiced by Richard E Grant and Adrian Edmondson. Commissions from Punch, the Guardian and the Times followed. He collected his work into a series of books that make him appear to be a self-help guru: <em>Normal Sex</em> was followed by <em>Men: The Truth</em> and <em>The Truth About Love</em>. His Loomus cartoons about a small boy and his dysfunctional parents, which ran for 11 years in the Guardian Family section, were published as <em>Steven Appleby\u2019s Guide to Life</em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s all a question of curation, he says. \u201cSo for <em>Normal Sex</em>, I collected everything I\u2019d ever done about sex and divided it into sections.\u201d Published in black and white in 1993, its opening pages are a characteristic mix of awkward truths and absurdist humour: \u201cSome individuals are attracted only to themselves. Other confused people believe they may belong to a hitherto undiscovered sex. Of course creepie-crawlies have sexual worries too. Worms have trouble deciding which end is which \u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Dragman</em> is his first venture into sustained narrative, and it has already been optioned for a live action TV adaptation. In some ways, he says, it\u2019s a strange choice of subject because \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about superheroes at all, but I loved the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/09/batman-box-set-review-60s-cult-classic\" title=\"\">Batman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/09/batman-box-set-review-60s-cult-classic\" title=\"\"> series</a> that I watched in the 1960s and, looking back, I probably wanted to be Catwoman.\u201d He read the Dandy and the Beano alongside his sister\u2019s comics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/aug/21/postgraduate.highereducation\" title=\"\">Bunty</a> and Diana. \u201cI did move on to superhero comics a bit, but not all that much.

I loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/27/philip-k-dick-best-novels-blade-runner-minority-report\" title=\"\">Philip K Dick</a>, particularly, because nothing in his books was ever quite what it appeared to be, and that seemed to be reality to me. Maybe it reflected the secret life that I had.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The relationship between fiction and autobiography is seldom as delicately nuanced as it is in Appleby\u2019s protagonists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which brings us back to the question of gender. Unlike <em>Dragman</em>, Appleby doesn\u2019t have a transvestite alias, though he lives full-time in woman\u2019s clothes. He briefly investigated gender reassignment but decided against it, citing his encounter with \u201cColin the mouse man\u201d \u2013 a pest-controller \u2013 as an example of both the challenges and rewards. \u201cColin arrived at the door and I opened it and said, \u2018Hi. I\u2019m Stephen. I changed my image a few years ago,\u2019 and he laughed, and we had this whole conversation. On his second visit he brought me a couple of leopard print screwdrivers, with little fluffy bits, and said \u2018I was given these for Christmas. I thought you might like them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He now lives partly in his studio and partly back at the family home with Sherring and her partner, a son and his girlfriend, a nephew, and, of course, Charlie and Una. Friendship is important to him, cropping up time and again in his professional life. When he wanted to try out the ideas in <em>Dragman</em>, it was to a member of his old school band that he turned.</p> <p>The book is full of Appleby\u2019s unique brand of punning fun. If it has a message, it\u2019s that it pays to be honest, and capitalism isn\u2019t honest: it steals souls. Its warning is knitted into a plot that is indebted to hard-boiled detective fiction and soap opera, as well as to his own experience of the cross-dressing scene.</p> <p>\u201cI would know people as Deirdre or Susan and have no idea what their male name is, or whether they\u2019re a plumber or a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel so lucky that the world allows me to be myself. \u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dragman</em> is published by Vintage (RRP \u00a318.99).

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn\u2019t even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">failing</a>\u201d testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening.</p> \n<p>Trump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/presentation-us-hospitals-preparing-for-millions-of-hospitalizations-2020-3?international=true&amp;r=US\">running into the millions</a> and only about 45,000 ICU beds <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">available</a> in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-donald-trump-presidency-sick-joke\">The sick joke of Donald Trump's presidency isn't funny any more | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Trump and his allies can no longer lie or deny, we can expect them to move on to the next phase of their crisis management playbook: attacking their enemies. It is already clear that they intend to interpret the virus not primarily as an existential threat to millions of Americans, but as an existential threat to their own political power. With the markets tumbling and Trump\u2019s re-election suddenly in doubt, it is only a matter of time before the right goes on the offensive. When they do, it won\u2019t be the virus in their sights, but the familiar foes: journalists, experts, blue states, immigrants and people of color.</p> \n<p>At this point, the coronavirus pandemic will intersect with Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses in truly frightening ways. With parts of the country experiencing levels of privation and death rarely seen in peacetime, Trump will feel justified in invoking emergency powers. In a declared state of emergency, the president has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/\">extraordinary powers</a>, including the ability to freeze an American\u2019s finances and deprive them of the ability to legally work, to control digital communications, and to deploy the military domestically. Aside from these enumerated items, Trump has repeatedly shown that he anyway believes that there are no legal or constitutional limits on presidential authority.</p> \n<p>Most worrying of all are the implications for immigrant communities and people of color. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he has a racialized view of who is a \u201ctrue\u201d American, from denying Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship to telling congresswomen of color born in the US to \u201cgo back\u201d to where \u201cthey came\u201d from. It would be extraordinary if this doesn\u2019t at the very least color his decisions on where to send federal aid and how to deploy his emergency powers. There is also a disturbing likelihood that Trump will attempt to stoke racism in order to rally his base and present the coronavirus as an alien plot against (white) America.</p> \n<p>Already the right has shown a tendency to lash out at foreigners in its response to the virus, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan\">insisting on labeling it</a> \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d to carrying out border closures while doing little to stop transmission within the United States. In a bizarre statement, Senator Tom Cotton even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hold-accountable-those-who-inflicted-it-on-the-world-tom-cotton-demands-punishment-for-coronavirus-outbreak\">threatened</a> to \u201chold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\u201d. Once the virus is undeniably established in America, it is all too likely that this animus and psychological need for scapegoats will be directed at those the right considers alien interlopers at home. The results \u2013 both from the misuse of state power, and from privately \u2013 inflicted terrorism and violence \u2013 could be profound.</p> \n<p>It is also time to start worrying about the 2020 election. If the economy has crashed, there are countless dead, and Trump is badly trailing in the polls, it is almost inevitable that he will attempt to cast doubt on the wisdom and legitimacy of holding a November election. He would not have to do anything so drastic as to attempt to call off the election \u2013 instead, he could call for his supporters to boycott it, then simply refuse to acknowledge the result. If the Republican party faces an electoral wipeout, its craven behavior over the last few years can give us no confidence that the party would defend the democratic process and eject Trump from the White House.</p> \n<p>In short, nothing in Trump\u2019s record \u2013 or that of his ardent base, whose political support is all he cares about \u2013 can lead us to believe that he will use his power to protect and serve all Americans equally in a time of unprecedented crisis. He might look like a deer in the headlights right now, but soon enough he will snap back to the unreality he lives in and deploy the only political trick he knows: rallying his base, abusing his power, trashing his foes. Many Americans will have to deal with the reality of a president who is not only incompetent to defend them but doesn\u2019t even regard them as legitimate Americans worthy of protection. This epidemiological crisis is also a political one. We should prepare to defend against both.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University</p></li> \n</ul>",

The theme of health covers expected changes, such as the menopause, as well as illness. A story from <em>Grief Works</em> about a family mourning their four-year-old who died in a swimming pool has continued to haunt me. The most heart-wrenching case here is that of Ben, a widowed father of two who has just started to adjust to his bereavement when he receives a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. Samuel has not cherry-picked cases to portray herself as a saviour. Nor does she consider therapy a cure-all: she concedes what Ben needs is not counselling but a turn of luck.</p> <p>In the chapter on identity we encounter a Kurdish refugee, a young man coming out, and KT, a patient who identifies as gender non-binary.

  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a gun going off, and once that\u2019s happened there\u2019s no going back.\u201d This is how Guardian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemerobertson\" title=\"\">Graeme Robertson</a> describes the onset of alopecia. Robertson developed it 17 years ago. He was 23 and covering the Iraq war, during which he witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/23/iraq.unitednations\" title=\"\">the 2003 bombing </a>of the UN building in Baghdad that killed 22 people. \u201cI was having lunch opposite, then there were bodies everywhere,\u201d he recalls. A few days later, \u201cI was in the shower, when I got out, I shaved, and a 50p-size clump came off my beard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8d838ff013f1f9b15770fef6373b7a292a16c5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d838ff013f1f9b15770fef6373b7a292a16c5e/68_0_634_792/400.jpg\" alt=\"Graeme Robertson\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graeme Robertson: \u2018I wanted to help people who were going through it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the start of a dramatic physical transformation. Before his hair loss, Robertson had a thick beard and a body covered in dark hair. It took time for him to accept that he had alopecia. An umbrella term for hair loss or balding, it is commonly caused by an autoimmune condition that attacks the hair follicles (those with it often cite stress as a trigger). In around 20% of cases, there is a family history \u2013 and there is no cure. For Robertson, one of the hardest aspects was the growing disconnect between his appearance and his internal sense of masculinity: \u201cOne girl whom I went out with said it was like kissing a doll, because I\u2019ve not got any stubble. She said, \u2018If I close my eyes, it\u2019s like I\u2019m kissing a girl.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He entered a middle phase, where he had half a moustache, half a head of hair, half a beard, which he got around by shaving daily. However, the psychological impact of losing his eyebrows and eyelashes was significant. \u201cWhen you lose eyelashes and start getting sore eyes, you lose everything. You either have to accept that there\u2019s something different about you, or go the opposite way and drive yourself insane about how you look or feel.\u201d</p> <p>Having come to terms with his hair loss, Robertson has started documenting the experiences of others. \u201cWhen it was happening, I didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to help people who were going through it. It started as a side project then turned into something in-depth, and I saw how many people were struggling.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Poppy Aithwaite</strong><br>18, waitress/barmaid, Teesside</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a3c6ec48ead740a89ae3d749ddb0858a1b700c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a3c6ec48ead740a89ae3d749ddb0858a1b700c2/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poppy Aithwaite for Alopecia UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was eight months old when I developed alopecia and had no hair until I was about three. Then, from the age of three to 13, I had tiny bald patches behind my ears. I used to think it was the worst thing ever. At 13, it all fell out really quickly. I ended up with nothing. I think it was the stress of going to secondary school that triggered it. And being a teenager; your hormones are changing, too.</p> <p>At school I didn\u2019t want to be different, so I tried to hide it. Wearing a wig was horrendous. I was constantly scared: what if someone pulls it? What if someone thinks it\u2019s funny? I\u2019d get comments such as, \u201cShe\u2019s more bald than my dad.\u201d At the time, I couldn\u2019t talk about it. I just sobbed. It got to the point where I wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. I wouldn\u2019t eat, I wouldn\u2019t open my blinds. I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once, the place where I was working was boiling. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I dropped out of school when I was 15. I was a mess and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. My mam\u2019s a hairdresser, so I started working with her, and at first I loved being able to do all these different things with everybody\u2019s hair, but over time it got harder. I switched to working in bars and restaurants instead, and started seeing a reiki healer. It sounds too good to be true, but she got rid of all my pain. Since then my confidence has just grown.</p> <p>One summer, the place where I was working was boiling and rammed. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid. I feel as if I just woke up one day and something had clicked. I\u2019ve heard all the names that anyone\u2019s going to call me by now. If they see me as \u201cthat baldy lass\u201d, so what?</p> <p>Instagram helped, too. There are many different types of hair loss, whether that be patches or total baldness. There\u2019s everything there for people to see. I model for a wig company, and at first I was scared about the pictures being posted. Then I thought, why am I bothered? I want them to see how happy I am. I don\u2019t want to be that depressed person who loses their hair, I want to be that young girl who inspires people to be who they are.</p> <p>Having alopecia and being in relationships has never been a problem. I\u2019m gay and it\u2019s easier being with a girl. Girls are more understanding. I\u2019ve got a drawer full of wigs. One day I\u2019ve got brown hair, the next I\u2019ve got pink. When I first lost my hair, I felt as if my identity had been ripped away. Now I can be who I want to be.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Michael Taylor</strong><br>27, tech worker, Berlin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07d351958d43a4f3b2ad705d5cc62049198ae9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d351958d43a4f3b2ad705d5cc62049198ae9c9/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I used to have a very luscious beard and my alopecia began with a fingerprint-sized hole on my chin. I actually found it endearing. I would walk around work and say: \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d Shortly afterwards, I moved to Berlin for a promotion, and within six months I needed to shave completely. Then I got a patch around the crown of my head. I went to the barber and it was a really uncomfortable experience. He showed me the back of my head in the mirror and there were many patches forming. I realised that this was going to change my life permanently.</p> <p>When I came back to London for my Christmas break, I went to the local barbershop with one of my best friends, and got my head shaved. I remember seeing a mole on the back of my head for the first time, which was interesting. Then I walked out, feeling very cold and a little bit shaken.</p> <p>I think I had a genetic predisposition to alopecia, because there are autoimmune diseases in my family. But I also had a really traumatic year while I was losing my hair. I was adjusting to living in a new country; my long-term relationship fell apart; I lost my dog. Suddenly I was single, without any friends. I was withdrawn for a while. I was mourning, essentially. And then I was dealing with this hair loss.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a while I tried very hard to reverse it naturally. For three months I gave up all of the good stuff in life: cigarettes, alcohol, sugar \u2013 even lots of vegetables that are considered inflammatory. I tried yoga and meditation.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve come out the other side and realised my own peace of mind is more important than sacrificing many things in the hope that I will get some regrowth. I have no way of knowing when or if I will get any, and I am OK with that, at least for now.</p> <p>I had a relatively weak hairline prior to that, so I don\u2019t miss the hair on my head very much. But I miss my beard and my facial hair. I can\u2019t lie about that. When you lose your eyebrows, it tips over into a space where people think that you are sick.</p> <p>But you have to see the funny side. I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps you get through the door. Online dating is a lot more difficult, because it is a purely visual medium. The best chance of meeting somebody is just being out and living life.</p> <p>Paradoxically, I am probably less self-conscious now. I think back to how I was, clinging on to that rubbish hairline. Now, I just find that hilarious. There is something liberating about shedding those concerns about how you look.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Rima Theisen</strong><br>38, flight attendant, Margate</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b2d3a01dd8879a156d562ba94ee95d1c7e2de3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b2d3a01dd8879a156d562ba94ee95d1c7e2de3c/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rima Theisen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My alopecia started six months after I had my second child. I had an itchy patch at the back that I kept scratching. I thought it was normal postpartum hair loss. I was in denial. I kept thinking: it\u2019s fine, it will grow back. Then one morning when I started to brush my hair, it was coming out in clumps. Four weeks later, I thought, sod it, it\u2019s got to come off. So, I shaved it all off and raised more than \u00a32,000 for <a href=\"https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/\" title=\"\">Teenage Cancer Trust</a>.</p> <p>When I found out that it wasn\u2019t going to grow back, it was a blow. Your hair is a part of your personality. I was always known for my really long, dark hair and I used to wear a huge bun at work. When I went back after maternity leave, I hadn\u2019t told anyone and they said: \u201cOh my God, are you OK? Are you ill?\u201d I just didn\u2019t want to wear a wig. I thought I would embrace this and be me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy. You just have to learn to tell yourself that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My hair was my thing \u2013 I never cut it \u2013 so it took me a long time to get used to looking at myself in the mirror. But I kept telling myself it was just a look. Some women choose to shave their heads. Losing my brows and lashes affected me more, because no one would choose to shave off their eyebrows and have no eyelashes. I would take those back in an instant over my head hair.</p> <p>Alopecia is a strange condition that nobody knows much about. It doesn\u2019t cause physical pain and it\u2019s not life-threatening, but people don\u2019t realise the mental impact. One of my biggest fears was that my husband would not find me attractive any more. It must be hard to be with someone who looks completely different from when you met them. He\u2019s been amazing, but when it came to having sex I felt really unattractive. I just didn\u2019t feel very womanly.</p> <p>I still get that sometimes, but I\u2019ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy. You just have to learn to trick your mind, to tell yourself that. I wear bigger earrings to compensate for the lack of hair. And I can still wear my uniform, put my red lipstick on and be \u201cthe different one\u201d at work. People used to say: \u201cOh, Rima with the hair.\u201d Now I\u2019m known for being the only bald female crew member out of 4,000.</p> <p>When you lose your hair, it\u2019s like losing your identity, really, and you have to get to know a whole new self. It does teach you who you are. Alopecia doesn\u2019t define my life, but it has made me realise what is important: my husband, my children, my confidence.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Laura Buckeridge </strong><br>actor,<strong> </strong>London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f603d674aaa6e77d619fb6a7937feb6e78837685\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f603d674aaa6e77d619fb6a7937feb6e78837685/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Buckeridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I started losing my hair during my GCSEs, with a 2p-piece-sized patch on the back of my head. I just remember crying and crying, and then eventually going to the doctor. I was revising and very depressed. I wanted to be an actor, and my dad had said: \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s the nearest thing to prostitution.\u201d We were a very religious family, and I made the connection that, because my hair was falling out, God must be punishing me. My dad had this traditional West Indian mindset that \u201cyour hair is your beauty\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I had children, the wigs came out. I didn\u2019t want to look weird for them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In my teens I always had afros and plaits, so you couldn\u2019t see the alopecia. I shaved my head occasionally, and for my wedding, I was fine in front of hundreds of people in a big white dress, with a bald head and an ornate crown. I asked my husband: \u201cHow was I so strong then?\u201d and he said: \u201cYou just loved being different.\u201d But you can be a confident person and then something happens, and you think, I can\u2019t face it today. In the end, losing my hair took away my career. The whole thing about acting is your image. To walk in the door with nothing\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t do it.</p> <p>When I had children, the wigs came out. I didn\u2019t want to look weird for them. I\u2019d moved into a new area and the last thing I wanted was to stand out. At the playgroups, I was often the only black woman there. My husband is a white, middle-class man who is Oxford-educated, and I didn\u2019t want to have an impact on his career. I was playing the dutiful wife. It feels silly to say that alopecia robs you of your identity, but you just don\u2019t recognise yourself. When I put the wig on, I thought, oh, I remember her.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t tell anyone my hair wasn\u2019t real for years. I was clutching on to my hair on windy days, smiling when people said: \u201cYou\u2019ve changed your hair!\u201d thinking, really? You don\u2019t know? Then I went to see the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\" title=\"\">Black Panther</a>, and there is a lovely scene where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/crush-on-danai-gurira-the-walking-dead\" title=\"\">Danai Gurira</a>\u2019s character takes her wig off and throws it across the room. I just thought: yes! Now I have stopped wearing a wig, because I felt I was living a lie.</p> <p>At first I was terrified, but I love being bald. This summer when I went \u201ctopless\u201d I was able to spend the whole two weeks in the pool. And whenever there is another bald black woman, they tend to come up and we have a lovely chat.</p> <p>You have to be strong, because people stare. You think: why are they staring? Oh yes, I\u2019m black. And bald. I forgot. I do a lot of work in schools and there\u2019s no better education than seeing a black woman who can speak in public, who is bald, and it is normal. I hope that I empower people. I look good without a wig. I\u2019m happy.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Alice Peck </strong><br>29, works for the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award programme, Bristol</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d5608f4622715f7c0ff6698f38327aba1a5f610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d5608f4622715f7c0ff6698f38327aba1a5f610/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Peck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My alopecia started more than three years ago. I was working in a job with some very burned-out co-workers, and I was badly bullied. I was young, idealistic and hopeful about where I wanted my life to go, so I wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of experience. I began to notice little patches, and at the time I thought it was nothing. I thought it was stress-related and that it would go away.</p> <p>In the subsequent two years, those patches became bigger, then I got some regrowth and it fell out again. The uncertainty was difficult. I was very paranoid. I was obsessed with this idea that everyone was staring at me. Every day I\u2019d cover my hair over the bald patches, and pencil in eyebrows.</p> <p>By this time I was working in refugee camps in Larissa in northern Greece, and it was very difficult to acknowledge my own struggle. I was waking up with a pillow full of hair, then doing stressful humanitarian work. There was shame that I was even struggling, then the shame of looking so different, and feeling so weird and alone. I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it because the situations we were facing were so much bigger than mine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate. Trying to 'own' my baldness is the way I cope with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I left Greece after realising that my health was really being affected by the stress. I went back to my parent\u2019s house for the first time in 10 years and lived there. By then, my hair was falling out in clumps and I decided to shave it off. Since doing that, it hasn\u2019t always been easy, but I feel much more in control. I took charge of it rather and being a victim.</p> <p>I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate. Trying to \u201cown\u201d my baldness is the way I cope with it. I wear more makeup now than I did before and I wear more statement earrings. Seeing other women with buzzed heads or who rock their baldness is empowering. I date men and women, and I think with women it\u2019s much more acceptable to look different. With men, there seems to be a more shallow idea of what women should look like, or so I think.</p> <p>I had eating disorders in my 20s, so I\u2019ve never really felt so comfortable in my body. Alopecia has forced me to confront my own image so, in a way, I\u2019m grateful for it. The only hair I didn\u2019t lose was my armpit hair, which is quite funny. Now I\u2019m very proud of it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Elena McGowan</strong><br>52, volunteer and stay-at-home mum, Jersey<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"94353970471671d3ae95792eb2235332b5c29d42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94353970471671d3ae95792eb2235332b5c29d42/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elena McGowan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My hair first fell out when I was 30, and it made me really miserable. I tried a couple of medical routes and quickly realised nothing could be done. I felt awful. I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone about it and nobody saw me without hair, even my husband. I hid it away. I thought I looked like an alien.</p> <p>I had a job in a customer-facing role in a bank, so I had to literally put on my wig and put on a face and be the person that people were expecting to see. The first day I went in with my wig, this guy came in and said: \u201cOh Elena, what have you done to your hair?\u201d I burst into floods of tears, ran to the loo and was there for about half an hour, trying to compose myself. Also, when you\u2019ve got a bit of hair, you don\u2019t have control of where your wig is. I was always worrying about whether it was straight or not. It puts you in a state of heightened anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet didn\u2019t exist when I had it first time, but when I Googled it this time I was amazed.

I couldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror for a long time, because I didn\u2019t recognise myself. Then my hair started to grow back and I was able to ditch the wigs, until about three years ago when it started to thin again. For a couple of weeks I was in utter despair. I thought, I can\u2019t face going through this again: it\u2019s so unfair. Just go away. Leave me alone.</p> <p>By then I was a mum. So I thought, actually, no. Hair is important, but there\u2019s more to life. And I shaved my head.</p> <p>The internet didn\u2019t exist when I had alopecia the first time, but when I Googled it this time I was amazed. There\u2019s so much stuff. I started a support group in Jersey and it\u2019s had an amazingly positive impact on my life. It\u2019s lovely to be able to help people get out of the place of despair where everybody starts, to a place of acceptance and happiness. Now, putting my hair on is the last thing I\u2019ll do before I walk out of the door, and quite often I don\u2019t notice whether I have it on or not. I keep my wig in the kitchen on a champagne bottle. Why not?</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful I\u2019ve got alopecia. Beauty is not all about the outside.

In the 1970s it was two plaits with a centre parting, and my parting started getting wider. I thought it was linked to eczema, so I modified my hairstyle to accommodate it. Then in my 20s, the doctor said: \u201cIt\u2019s alopecia. There\u2019s no cure for it, it\u2019s to do with your immune system.\u201d </p> <p>Losing my husband at a younger age was probably the biggest trigger, but it didn\u2019t affect me until about two years afterwards. At one point my mum and sister were poorly; I was busy looking after them and my hair came back for two years. Then as soon as they got better, it started to fall out again. I was at my baldest in 2017. I couldn\u2019t look in the mirror, because it just wasn\u2019t me. After my eyelashes fell out, my eyes were swollen all the time, and I was getting allergic reactions.

I can\u2019t wait to get it off. Sometimes at work, I have to go to the toilet, take it off, hang it up, calm my head down, then put it all back on. And wigs stop you from doing certain things. It was hard to date. I used to sabotage relationships, purely because I\u2019d be thinking, how the hell do I explain? He\u2019ll go to kiss me and the wig will come off. The first time I was with my current partner and my scarf came off, I couldn\u2019t stop crying because I just didn\u2019t want him to see the real me. I felt embarrassed. I felt ugly. But on the other hand, I wanted somebody to give me a chance to show that this doesn\u2019t define me.</p> <p>I wear my wig because I don\u2019t want people looking at me and making judgments. People see guys with bald heads and think it\u2019s part of the ageing process, or he\u2019s decided to shave his head and, actually, he looks quite sexy. They won\u2019t necessarily see the same in a woman.

Is there anything you need?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Raymond Shek</strong><br>36, business data analyst, Leicester<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e9ebb689963b5e6c14f2667d3fee3e1dd7e2686\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e9ebb689963b5e6c14f2667d3fee3e1dd7e2686/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Shek for Alopecia UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>From the age of 10, I had a small, fist-sized bald patch at the back of my head. I was quite self-conscious about being different, but my school allowed me to wear a baseball cap. I was picked on, but not a lot. I was probably lucky; the friends I had weren\u2019t bullies. They were quite encouraging. I put up with wearing a cap for a few years, but after a while, I just got fed up with it. My friends would say: \u201cOh, you\u2019re not wearing your hat today,\u201d but I didn\u2019t think twice. I was confident in myself, even with a bald patch.</p> <p>When I hit 20, it all fell out within two weeks and stayed the same for eight years. At that age, I thought, what the heck, who cares? I\u2019ll just shave it off. At least then, when I woke up in the morning, I wouldn\u2019t find clumps of hair on my pillow. At first my scalp was quite pale but after a couple of weeks in the sun it evened out, so it just looked normal after that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not having eyelashes, if you walk past a building site, dust gets in your eyes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it does impact your life. Not having eyelashes, if you walk past a building site, dust gets in your eyes. My scalp is quite sensitive and if anything like a woolly hat touches it, it gets really itchy. So it gets cold in winter. I have tried dating apps and had no luck on that. People judge on appearances and it\u2019s not until they meet me that they see that I am quite a lively sort of person.</p> <p>When I meet new people I say: \u201cMy name\u2019s Ray, or you can call me the bald Chinese guy.\u201d I think I am the only bald Chinese guy in Leicester. Rather than having people say that to me, I\u2019m saying it first. I\u2019m quite a relaxed, chilled person, and if you have questions about my baldness, don\u2019t be afraid: ask.</p> <p>People do sometimes. Once, in the supermarket, the security guard asked, \u201cHow do you always get your head so smooth? What do you use?\u201d which was quite funny. Alopecia has saved me money on haircuts, buying razor blades to shave my face, buying loads of shampoo. On that side, I think it is brilliant.</p> <p>People stare at me sometimes, but I don\u2019t judge them for it. I don\u2019t really care what they think. They don\u2019t know the story. If they want to take the mick out of me, then that\u2019s their problem. I feel comfortable with my own identity.</p> <p>Before this project I thought I was quite alone in this. Now I\u2019ve found out that there is a community out there, I\u2019d like to help other people with alopecia. If young kids can see adults with alopecia being secure about themselves, that will help them feel more comfortable with themselves, too.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Laura McDermott and Joanna York.</em></p> <p>\u2022 Alopecia UK, which supports people with hair loss, can be reached at <a href=\"http://alopecia.org.uk\" title=\"Alopecia UK\">alopecia.org.uk</a></p> <p>If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

The finding suggests an infected person may have traveled from Washington to California and had contact with the someone who boarded the ship.</p> <p>What is certain, however, is that the 75-old-year old Placer county man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on 4 March \u2013 the first death in California attributed to the virus.</p> <p>About 60 passengers who traveled with him to Mexico stayed on the ship\u2019s next journey to Hawaii, mixing with other passengers.</p> <p>Passengers had little reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary until the ship slowly started canceling events: first, the shows that drew large crowds, then the smaller events like music or dancing lessons that keep passengers busy at sea.</p> <p>The morning of 4 March, the same day the Placer county man died at a hospital, Grand Princess officials told the 60 passengers who traveled with him they\u2019d need to stay in their rooms until they could be screened for symptoms.</p> <p>Still, most were allowed to carry on, catching sun on the Lido deck and visiting with their shipmates.</p> <p>The elderly Weissbergers were playing cards with friends when news of the potential outbreak reached their daughter and son-in-law back in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cWe called [the Weissbergers] and asked if they were quarantined,\u201d said son-in-law Chalik, an attorney who has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/grand-princess-cruise-coronavirus-lawsuit\">in a lawsuit filed</a> on the couple\u2019s behalf, accusing the Princess Cruises of gross negligence for its \u201clackadaisical\u201d response to the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018No, we\u2019re playing bridge\u2019,\u201d Chalik recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. We asked, \u2018You\u2019re playing bridge with other passengers? And you\u2019re touching the same cards?\u2019 They had no idea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af434c1e1c3b414e838f989b22b3b1d59b7d1865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af434c1e1c3b414e838f989b22b3b1d59b7d1865/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Princess cruise ship carrying passengers who have tested positive for coronavirus in the San Francisco Bay area.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Princess cruise ship carrying passengers who have tested positive for coronavirus in the San Francisco Bay area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Greaves/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Things get worse</h2> <p>Later that day Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, announced <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/\">a state of emergency</a> and, citing those on board who had shown symptoms said the Grand Princess, would head back to California early for testing.</p> <p>The toughest moment for Michelle Heckert, a Bay Area woman traveling with her grandparents, came when she learned all passengers would need to stay in their rooms until further notice.</p> <p>\u201cI called my mom in tears, like \u2018I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t stay in this room the whole time.\u2019 I was just really scared about the uncertainty of it all,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared for myself. I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m young.

In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMUJ4BkiRvw\">dramatic scene</a>, US coast guard helicopters dropped tests onto the Grand Princess. Of the 45 tested,<strong> </strong>19 crew members and 2 passengers<strong> </strong>would test positive for the virus and about 100 passengers showed symptoms.</p> <p>Crew members, many who shared space for accommodations and meals, would deliver meals to rooms individually \u2014 which health experts said was one of the factors why the quarantine of passengers within a cruise ship\u2019s close quarters is ineffective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6886edd5ac377b9b9fd6747b8f560f5719932657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6886edd5ac377b9b9fd6747b8f560f5719932657/0_523_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on board the Grand Princess watch while a US military helicopter delivers coronavirus tests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers on board the Grand Princess watch while a US military helicopter delivers coronavirus tests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Berry/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In reference to the Diamond Princess, where passengers also faced prolonged quarantine, Dr Amesh Adalja, with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-coronavirus-quarantines-have-failed-health-law-ethics-experts-2020-2\">told Business Insider</a> that quarantining passengers on a cruise ship allows \u201cthe virus to literally pick them off one-by-one\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole idea of the cruise ship quarantine was ill-conceived, and the resultant slew of infections it spawned was completely predictable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the Grand Princess idled offshore, Donald Trump publicly expressed reluctance to bring the ship home.</p> <p>\u201cI like the numbers where they are,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/07/i-like-the-numbers-being-where-they-are-trump-video\">Trump said</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were in shock,\u201d Chalik said of the Weissbergers\u2019 reaction to comments from the president.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually like a lot of what Donald Trump has to say, and here he\u2019s talking about them like they\u2019re just numbers.

Four large private passenger buses waited to transport the possibly-infected passengers.</p> <p>Passengers disembarked by order of priority, those with acute medical needs first. Officials said it could take up to three days to unload everybody. But by Friday, five days after the Grand Princess first docked, 14 international passengers still remained on board.

There were no hand-washing stations available in the food areas and the passengers had to serve themselves coffee using their bare hands on the coffee dispenser, she said.</p> <p>On 10 March, the day the Grand Princess first reached Oakland, passengers received an official document under their cabin doors that read: \u201cOnce you arrive at the military installation, you may choose to be tested for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>But Morse said that when she and her husband asked to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday, they were told no tests were available.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not testing us. On the ship they gave us a paper that said we would be tested. When we got here (three days ago), they took our temperatures instead,\u201d Morse said.</p> <p>Heckert, also quarantined at Travis air force base, said on Thursday that her family hadn\u2019t been tested, either.</p> <p>Congressman John Garamendi on Thursday filed a complaint with the federal department of Health and Human Services on Morse\u2019s behalf. It was only then, Morse said, that staff began delivering food to passenger\u2019s rooms instead of having them line up to grab plastic boxes from tall stacks.</p> <p>\u201cWe were better off on the ship,\u201d Morse said, adding that cruise ship staff left food outside their door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c/0_0_3836_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eric Olsen, a spokesman for Rep Garamendi, said the congressman sent pictures of the food distribution problems to HHS, which is running the quarantine.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to health guidelines, you\u2019re supposed to be separating people in their rooms,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIf someone is Covid-19 positive, this (mingling) is going to spread the disease.

Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing.</p> \n  <p>But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6c28268f085e564ad83ece\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T00:44:46.728Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New Zealand cancels Christchurch shootings remembrance service</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a pragmatic decision.

Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers.</p> \n   <p>Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well. But as soon as that advice was clear, I thought it was a gobsmacking lack of judgement for <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> to continue to go to the football, sending a terrible signal and message to the Australian people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Australia\u2019s home affairs minister<strong> Peter Dutton</strong> being tested with coronavirus, Bowen said; \u201cWe wish him the best, this is not a pleasant disease\u201d.

Matches this weekend will continue to take place, but without spectators.</p> \n  <p>This morning at a regular press conference which the head of the Robert Koch Institute, the leading public health and safety body in Germany has been holding for the past two and a half weeks, its director, Lothar Wieler said public health bodies had three aims in their attempts to tackle the virus. </p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>To try to \u2018level off\u2019 the epidemic curve, to ensure the most seriously ill don\u2019t end up having to be hospitalised at the same time.</li> \n   <li>To try to speed up the adaptation of hospitals to cope with an increase in intensive care beds and patients who will need respiratory assistance. He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system.</li> \n   <li>To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels.</p> \n  <p>Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. </p> \n  <p>One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b72be8f088d7575592b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:49:21.690Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports <strong>Rory Carroll</strong> in Dublin.<br></p> \n  <p>An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">announced restrictions on Thursday</a>.

It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. </p> \n  <p>The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East. A German tourist transferred from Luxor to a hospital in the resort town Hurghada died last Sunday from the virus. </p> \n  <p>The outbreak in Mansoura shows that the virus is spreading inside Egypt. \u201cThe 13 new coronavirus cases include six who showed no symptoms and had contracted the virus after coming into contact with people who previously tested positive,\u201d said government-owned outlet Al-Ahram.</p> \n  <p>Egypt\u2019s health ministry continued to update the number of official cases, but has not regularly named the location of infections. The country\u2019s minister for education announced earlier this week that schools were banned from trips in the governorates of Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada due to outbreaks of the virus. </p> \n  <p>The ministry also announced that a school in the central district of Zamalek would close and parents and teachers self-isolate for a fortnight \u201cas a precautionary measure, after a parent of one of the school students was in contact with a foreigner who tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>As the disease shows signs of spreading, some in Cairo attempted to retain a sense of business as usual even as Egypt was battered by a freak storm forcing many to stay indoors.
