  "<p>\u201cWhat did you do in the war, Mr Bukovi?\u201d \u201cI invented the false 9. What did you do?\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t all Marton Bukovi did during the second world war. The Hungarian coach \u2013 quite possibly the greatest tactical mind football has known \u2013 found himself in Zagreb, coaching Gradjanski, when the conflict began. When the Ustashe seized power and began enacting antisemitic legislation, his position became insecure, given he was the son of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. He, in as much as religion bothered him at all, seems to have identified as Christian, and there is a cross on his gravestone in the Rakoskeresztur cemetery in Budapest, but his wife, Aranka Klein, was Jewish and at least one of his sisters was a practising Jew.</p> <p>Bukovi not only kept working but also helped protect the club\u2019s groundsman, a Jewish refugee called Max Reisfeld who had fled Nazi Vienna, taking food and provisions to him and his family as they hid under a stand at the stadium where, for four years, they remained undetected and survived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7a97f9c5cf8f5ea526b4dfd230d4a68dd73f8c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7a97f9c5cf8f5ea526b4dfd230d4a68dd73f8c9/105_68_979_587/500.jpg\" alt=\"Marton Bukovi with some of his MTK players in 1949\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marton Bukovi with some of his MTK players in 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fortepan/Kov\u00e1cs M\u00e1rton Ern\u0151</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bukovi was courageous and a man of firm principle but he was also notoriously difficult. He had his habits and was rarely minded to change them. He loved the cinema and would go every day after training, but he hated being distracted so would turn up at the box office, ask if his wife were there and, if she were, he would go on to a different cinema.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a hard man,\u201d said Marika Lantos, whose husband, Mihaly, later worked as Bukovi\u2019s assistant at Olympiakos. \u201cPrecise, strict and consistent. He demanded order and discipline. It didn\u2019t matter who a player was; he would always tell him what he thought of him. That might be why many didn\u2019t love him. He could be reserved and grumpy but he had a heart of gold. He was like a bad mother-in-law: he commented on everything and always found fault. He meant well, but he couldn\u2019t understand that he needed to make distinctions between people. He just said what he wanted to say.\u201d</p> <p>But then he was a genius, and geniuses perhaps are allowed some leeway with the social graces. When the war in Yugoslavia was over and the Communists were in control, the clubs who had played in the fascist league were disbanded and, in many cases, had their archives destroyed. Gradjanski, eventually, were reborn as Dinamo and Bukovi was persuaded to become manager.</p> <p>The interim had given him time to think. He had already overseen Gradjanski\u2019s transition from a 2-3-5 to the W-M formation but what, he wondered, if you went further? What if you withdrew the centre-forward so deep he was almost a midfielder, gave your inside-forwards licence and pulled one of the wing-halves so deep he was in effect a second central defender, turning the 3-2-2-3 of W-M into something very close to 4-2-4?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bed3b8896383215417a88c394c8ff062aa5c2d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bed3b8896383215417a88c394c8ff062aa5c2d6/0_375_4866_2921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ferenc Puskas scores Hungary\u2019s second goal in their 7-1 win against England in Budapest in 1954\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferenc Puskas (second right) scores Hungary\u2019s second goal in their 7-1 win against England in Budapest in 1954, using tactics Marton Bukovi developed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so, in 1946, in the game against Lokomotiva that would decide the Zagreb championship, Bukovi put his theory into practice.</p> <p>Gradjanski won and Bukovi was vindicated \u2013 not that he was entirely happy. \u201cDragutin Hripko played the role,\u201d he said. \u201cHe played it closer to well than to poorly, but far from ideally. As a footballer he never achieved great quality, but I always spoke about him when asked about a withdrawn striker. He was my lab rat \u2026 I can clearly remember how the Lokomotiva players didn\u2019t know how to handle him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A team is successful playing in a particular way, and so a means must be found to interrupt that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bukovi took the system with him when he returned to Budapest and by 1952 Hungary were using it to win Olympic gold, part of a four-year unbeaten run \u2013 in which they twice hammered a befuddled England \u2013 that ended with defeat by West Germany in the 1954 World Cup final.</p> <p>Managers rarely get time to think. The churn of games, the routine of training, of the day-to-day dealing with players is too much. But now, during a shutdown that will last at least a couple of months, managers do have time. Football is a mature game now: huge developmental steps such as Bukovi\u2019s are unlikely. Everything happens by increments. But what is possible? What might an enlightened manager do having been given this long period without the immediate pressure of games?</p> <p>Elite-level football tends to move forward by solutions. A team is successful playing in a particular way and so a means must be found to interrupt that. The possession-heavy game of Pep Guardiola and his imitators was eventually overcome by the high-energy, highly focused press and transition game of J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 to the extent that Guardiola has begun to change.</p> <p>That makes sense: the way to defeat possession football is to work out a way of disrupting those patterns of passing and regaining the ball better.</p> <p>So what comes next? How do you disrupt a pressing game? One way is simply to pass the ball better, in less predictable patterns. Perhaps if Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona of 2008-11 were still around, still at their peak and still with the dribbling potency of Lionel Messi, that would be possible (it may be that what passed was less their stylistic hegemony than simply the peak of that side). But given it is not, and given the seeming impossibility of that aim, how else could hard-pressing football be circumvented?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An obvious way, which Guardiola briefly took against Klopp\u2019s Borussia Dortmund in a German cup game, is to go over the press. Guardiola used Javi Mart\u00ednez as his target man, but perhaps target men in general are due a comeback. What better way to thwart a well-deployed pressing line than by whacking it long and early at a Niall Quinn or a Joe Jordan or a Nat Lofthouse, particularly if they could be supported by a rapid poacher? How better to unsettle two central defenders picked less for their marking and battling qualities than their positioning and passing than by making them defend against a pair?</p> <p>Or perhaps not. But in this time of enforced inaction, it\u2019s perhaps worth managers asking, what would Marton Bukovi do?</p>",

After receiving the Home Office submissions, Mr Justice Swift made an order on Friday night that a half-day hearing should be held next Wednesday to determine whether or not to grant the emergency measures requested in the legal challenge by the charity <a href=\"https://detentionaction.org.uk/\">Detention Action</a> and a vulnerable detainee who suffers from hypertension, which experts say doubles the risk of death if Covid-19 is contracted.</p> <p>As part of the legal action, the public health expert Prof Richard Coker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has provided an expert report warning that prisons and detention centres provide ideal incubation conditions for the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and that about 60% of those in detention could be rapidly infected if the virus gets into detention centres.</p> <p>Coker\u2019s report was commissioned by Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who have embarked on what is thought to be the first legal action against the government relating to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The UK government issued <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance\">guidance</a> stating that if there was a significant outbreak of Covid-19, \u201ccohorting\u201d should be used to put all those infected together behind locked doors in prisons, detention centres, young offender institutions and secure units.</p> <p>Many of those in detention have arrived from high-risk countries such as Iran, China and Italy. Some are forced to share rooms, and a \u201clock-in\u201d regime prevents many from leaving their cells during the night.</p> <p>Emma Ginn, director of the detention charity Medical Justice, said that those still in detention were scared of contracting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cWe are getting harrowing calls from seriously ill clients describing their fear of the virus spreading in the centres and feeling powerless in response. The distress in their voices is palpable and there is little we can do to console them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said:\u201dOur landmark legal challenge has already forced a response from the home secretary. We are delighted the high court has now ordered a hearing for next week and we\u2019ll be pressing for a robust review of all detentions. In the midst of a global pandemic, administrative detention puts those interned in grave danger. And maintaining detention when the evidence from Prof Coker is that detention centres act as \u2018epidemiological pumps\u2019 puts us all at unnecessary risk.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cImmigration enforcement is responding to the unique circumstances of the coronavirus outbreak and following the latest guidance from Public Health England. This includes providing soap and cleaning materials to all detainees. Decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis and kept under constant review, but our priority is to maintain the lawful detention of the most high-harm individuals, including foreign national offenders\u2019\u2019</p>",

But this one won\u2019t count. Osgood runs the length of the pitch, a straight-line dribble down the middle. Leeds are light at the back, Charlton out of position having been thrown up front. Only Madeley and Hunter are on point. Osgood drifts a little to the left, drawing Madeley and slipping a diagonal pass between the split defenders to Hutchinson, who taps home. But Hutchinson had carelessly drifted offside, way too eager, and the flag correctly pops up, fluttering in the breeze. Hutchinson explodes into a fit of wild rage, and briefly tries to start a barney with Harvey, but really, he\u2019s only cross with himself for going off too early.

Osgood, who had turned and kept on running, ghosts in and flicks a fine diving header past the outrushing Harvey and into the bottom left!

And it\u2019s got nothing whatsoever to do with Bonetti\u2019s injury. Facing his own goal and in his own half down the left, Clarke picks the ball up and turns. He evades three tackles, making it into the Chelsea half and eventually poking the ball forward to Jones just to the left of the centre circle. The striker heads off at high speed, drifts inside past Hollins, and evades the desperate slide tackle of McCreadie as the defender bumbles back from his position on the left. Once Jones reaches the right-hand side of the D, he cocks his leg back and unleashes an unstoppable rising drive into the top left. The keeper had no chance, gammy knee or no! Nor did the five \u2013 <em>five</em> \u2013 Chelsea players eviscerated by a sudden turn of pace from two Leeds men. Jones races off leaping and punching the air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f31c130f23c0bc3694796023ad1485e3af19633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f31c130f23c0bc3694796023ad1485e3af19633/0_0_2450_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Jones opens the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mick Jones opens the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T15:46:54.323Z\">at 3.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e76341c8f08dcc95cc20a9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T15:35:38.635Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>35 min:</strong> The game eventually restarts, Bonetti having washed his face with water and hobbled back to his station.

A fixture pile-up cost them their championship crown, the First Division title gifted to Everton, while Jock Stein\u2019s Celtic bossed them in the semi-finals of the European Cup. Now this is all that\u2019s left. Don Revie\u2019s sensational side couldn\u2019t end up completely empty handed, could they?</p> <p><strong>But never mind the overall context of their Homeric season; Leeds won\u2019t be happy to be contesting this replay on the merits of the first match alone. </strong>They were the better side two weeks ago, on a quagmire of a pitch at Wembley. (The pitch at the home of English football had been churned up days before its showpiece by <em>the Horse of the Year show.)</em> Leeds took the lead twice. On 20 minutes, Jack Charlton flapped his scrapeover at a cross; his header trickled over the goalline, half-turn by half-turn. Eddie McCreadie tried to kick it away, but took a fresh-air swipe and fell on his arse, like a drunk in a Frank Randle film. Peter Houseman equalised just before the break, his speculative long-range shot creeping into the bottom right corner under the body of Gary Sprake (who was sporting the sort of huge blond quiff not seen since ABC Television stopped making Oh Boy). Houseman celebrated by accidentally spitting all over his shirt.</p> <p><strong>Six minutes from time, Leeds looked to have won their first FA Cup, Mick Jones lashing into the bottom-left corner after Allan Clarke had hit the right-hand post with a header.</strong> But only two minutes later, Ian Hutchinson flashed home a near-post header from a left-wing John Hollins cross. Extra time produced no more goals, and with the rutted, muddy pitch now a complete joke, the FA decided to bundle everyone up to Old Trafford for the replay. And so here we are.</p> <p><strong>Can Leeds salvage their season by winning their first FA Cup? </strong>Or can Dave Sexton\u2019s men lift Chelsea\u2019s first FA Cup instead? It\u2019s a summit meeting between two of the best teams in football right now, Revie\u2019s men having finished second in the First Division behind Everton, Chelsea just behind them in third. Ancient history favours Chelsea, who have beaten Leeds on all four previous occasions they\u2019ve met in the cup; this season\u2019s league results point to a Leeds win, their having won 2-0 at Elland Road and 5-2 at Stamford Bridge.

  "<p>On 27 June 2019, the energy and clean growth minister Chris Skidmore signed papers that committed the UK to reduce carbon emissions to effectively <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law\">nothing by 2050</a>. If we are to stand any chance of meeting this target, known as \u201cnet zero\u201d, there is one enormous challenge that we will have to tackle: home heating.</p> <p>Warming our homes is responsible for between a quarter and a third of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s more than 10 times the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> created by the aviation industry. Around 85% of homes now use gas-fired central heating, and a large proportion of gas cooking still takes place. Greening this system is a huge challenge by any measure. But if recent reports are to be believed, there could be a simple and efficient way to do it: change from using natural gas to hydrogen gas.</p> <p>Hydrogen is abundant in the natural world and according to its advocates could power the next generation of gas appliances cleanly and efficiently.</p> <p>\u201cThe attraction of hydrogen is that for a lot of consumers, they wouldn\u2019t notice any difference. Customers would continue to use a boiler to heat their homes in a similar manner to natural gas,\u201d says Robert Sansom of the Institution of Engineering and Technology\u2019s energy policy panel. He is the lead author on a study conducted by the institute called <a href=\"https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/sectors/energy/energy-news/transitioning-to-hydrogen-assessing-the-engineering-risks-and-uncertainties/\">Transitioning to Hydrogen</a>.</p> <p>Together with colleagues, Sansom assessed the engineering risks and uncertainties associated with swapping our gas network to hydrogen. Their conclusion is that there is no reason why repurposing the gas network to hydrogen cannot be achieved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/hydrogen-uk-gas-grid-keele-university\">Zero-carbon hydrogen injected into gas grid for first time in groundbreaking UK trial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say it would be easy, though. Technological and practical hurdles exist because there is no blueprint for such a conversion: there is nowhere in the world that supplies pure hydrogen to homes and businesses. The UK would have to pioneer everything.</p> <p>Interest in hydrogen as a way to heat homes began in 2016 with a report called H21. It was conducted by Northern Gas Networks, the gas distributor for the north of England, and looked at whether it was technically possible and economically viable to convert Leeds to 100% hydrogen instead of natural gas.</p> <p>\u201cThey went into a lot of detail, from the hydrogen production plants right the way down to people\u2019s homes,\u201d says Sansom.</p> <p>The report drew a parallel to the way the gas industry converted from town gas to natural gas in the 1960s and 70s. Town gas was a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. It was mostly produced from the distillation of coal and oil and had been used for the first 150 years of the UK\u2019s gas industry. With the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, which is predominantly methane, the UK undertook a nationwide programme to convert 40m appliances over a decade.</p> <p>Whole streets would be converted at a time. Engineers would inspect the gas appliances, and then convert them. Simultaneously, the town gas was disconnected and the pipelines were purged with an inert gas. Finally, the natural gas was pumped into the system and the engineers would make sure each appliance worked correctly before moving to the next street along.</p> <p>Some manufacturers are now so convinced that a similar thing can happen with hydrogen that they have already begun to develop new household appliances. In February, <a href=\"https://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/img/documents/hydrogen/The_Future_of_Fuel.pdf\">Worcester Bosch</a> unveiled the prototype of its hydrogen-ready boiler. It would run first on natural gas and then, after a servicing visit, hydrogen.</p> <p>Also working in hydrogen\u2019s favour is that for the past 20 years, the gas industry has been systematically replacing the metal pipes in its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/domestic/gasmain.pdf\">iron mains</a>\u201d network with yellow polyethylene ones. Around 90% of the pipes will have been replaced by 2030. This is good news for hydrogen because the gas reacts with the old metal pipes, making them brittle. But the polyethylene is safe.</p> <p>\u201cEffectively we started a programme of hydrogen-proofing our gas network without knowing we were doing it,\u201d says Sansom, who found himself becoming more and more impressed by the concept. \u201cFrom a personal point of view, I was very much on the fence when I kicked off with this work. But I found myself slipping down on the hydrogen side in terms of its viability as a low carbon alternative to natural gas,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83cf920fe00a530005a17cefdc3c86a97ba969b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83cf920fe00a530005a17cefdc3c86a97ba969b8/0_0_6000_3368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Worcester Bosch\u2019s hydrogen-fired boiler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worcester Bosch\u2019s hydrogen-fired boiler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Worcester Bosch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not everyone is convinced by this sudden interest in hydrogen. Richard Lowes of the University of Exeter Energy Policy Group says that until recently the received wisdom had been that heating would have to be electrified in some way to meet our climate-crisis commitments. \u201cThat has basically come out of years and years of technical and economic modelling to look at how you get to fully decarbonised heating in the UK,\u201d says Lowes.</p> <p>Switching heating from gas to electricity would mean relying on heat pumps. These use electricity to extract heat from either the air or the ground. In the case of an air source heat pump, it works like a fridge but instead of sucking heat out of a food compartment, it pulls it out of the air and channels it into the home, where it is used to heat water, which is piped to radiators for central heating, and stored in a tank for hot water.</p> <p>But because this technology works at a lower temperature than existing boilers, it requires many homes to be much better insulated, or to have larger radiators, capable of delivering more heating power. For those who have switched to heat-as-you-go combi boilers, it will necessitate the reinstallation of a hot water tank.</p> <p>It\u2019s extensive work but worth it, according to Lowes, who has removed his own gas boiler and is now using an air source heat pump to heat his home. \u201cIt was a lot of work but my home and heating system are now a lot more efficient. It\u2019s always warm, there\u2019s always hot water and it\u2019s basically the same cost to run as gas,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can\u2019t dig up the roads when they\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Lowes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The third approach is called district heating. It envisages water being heated at a central facility using waste heat from industry or green sources such as solar power. The hot water is then delivered to many homes simultaneously through a network of heavily insulated underground pipes. Both methods can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of home heating but the downside is that they require extensive work to roll them out on a national scale.</p> <p>District heating would require water pipes to be laid under homes, and the widespread use of heat pumps would necessitate the National Grid\u2019s electricity circuits being upgraded. It is this kind of disruption that hydrogen\u2019s advocates say could be avoided because much of the national infrastructure has already been upgraded. That argument cuts no ice with Lowes. \u201cIt seems a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can\u2019t dig up the roads when they\u2019ve been doing it for the past 20 years,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He points out that although the consumer may not experience so much disruption, significant challenges for the gas industry remain. For example, the National Transmission System, which is the network of pipes that supplies gas from the coastal terminals to the gas distribution companies and other major users, is made of metal. This would need to be protected from embrittlement in some way before any switch to hydrogen could take place.</p> <p>\u201cHydrogen is certainly not a silver bullet,\u201d says Lowes. And if we get distracted by it, we could be getting ourselves into more trouble, missing the 2050 energy target altogether.</p> <p>But if there is so much uncertainty with hydrogen, why is the gas industry, which funds many of the studies, pushing it so hard? According to Chris Goodall, energy economist and author of <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50345546-what-we-need-to-do-now\">What We Need to Do Now for a Zero Carbon Future</a></em>, it is a matter of survival.</p> <p>\u201cThey do not wish for their industry to be eaten up by a switch to electricity for heating. So they are moving as fast as they can to persuade us about hydrogen,\u201d he says. And it all comes down to how the gas is produced.</p> <p>Hydrogen is not found on Earth in a pure state. Instead, it has to be extracted from other substances, and the best one to extract it from is methane \u2013 in other words natural gas. Hence, the gas companies could effectively keep their current operations running.</p> <p>But the extra steps involved in extracting the hydrogen would push the price up. Additionally, the extraction creates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so large scale carbon capture technology would need to be developed to prevent it escaping into the atmosphere. Although this is a technology that the UK will have to develop anyway in order to reach net zero by 2050, it will add to the cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94bea20a7ad39a7b8b1e81ae3254694474ab0782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94bea20a7ad39a7b8b1e81ae3254694474ab0782/0_208_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Northern Ireland\u2019s first sustainable hydrogen fuel cell bus, the Wrightbus, unveiled in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Northern Ireland\u2019s first sustainable hydrogen fuel cell bus, the Wrightbus, unveiled in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But natural gas is not the only substance that contains hydrogen. Water does too, and the hydrogen can be freed by a process called electrolysis, which doesn\u2019t create any carbon dioxide. To make it totally green, which is the ultimate hope, electrolysis could be powered by wind farms. At the moment, however, the price of such electricity is expensive, and that would push the price of hydrogen up still further.</p> <p>Goodall hopes that the cost will decrease as technology improves, but warns: \u201cYou can be accused of mindless optimism just by saying this.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s future energy landscape is without doubt a difficult realm to navigate. Perhaps the best route will be revealed by not pitting the various solutions against one another. \u201cAll three have strengths and weaknesses and I expect that there\u2019ll be a major role for each as a replacement for natural gas,\u201d says Sansom. Even hydrogen\u2019s detractors acknowledge this. \u201cAs a niche technology it can have real value,\u201d says Lowes. He goes on to paraphrase the Heineken lager adverts of the 70s and 80s, saying that hydrogen could potentially reach the parts of the country that other energy solutions can\u2019t.</p> <p>Goodall also sees a role for hydrogen to \u201cstore\u201d energy generated from renewable resources such as wind and solar power. The idea is that in windy months, any extra electricity generated from renewables will be used to make hydrogen, which would then be stored. When there is extra demand on the National Grid, or a seasonal drop in the power produced from renewables, the hydrogen can be burned to produce electricity.</p> <p>The truth is that all options for us to decarbonise our heating systems will require significant disruption and cost. And while government continues to deliberate, the clock ticks towards 2050.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need to wait. We can deploy stuff now that works fine,\u201d says Lowes, referring to his own experience of changing his gas boiler for a heat pump. \u201cThe urgency of climate change means there really isn\u2019t any reason to delay.\u201d</p> <p>Others believe that there is a role for hydrogen and think it is worth taking a little more time to consider. But there is one truth that everyone agrees upon. \u201cNone of this is easy. If anyone is saying to you this is easy, they are misleading you,\u201d says Lowes.</p> <h2>Hydrogen-powered cars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f857b4c9eb391db5e6b71d3512f4d2566abf3cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f857b4c9eb391db5e6b71d3512f4d2566abf3cb/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hydrogen filling station in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hydrogen filling station in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hydrogen can also power vehicles, but in a different way than it would heat houses. Instead of being burned, the hydrogen reacts with oxygen inside a device called a fuel cell. Electricity and water are produced. The electricity runs the car, the water drips from the exhaust pipe.<br><br>An attempt to switch to hydrogen vehicles in the 1990s was thwarted byelectric cars, which store their energy in an onboard battery. But a new push for hydrogen vehicles is coming from Asia. China, Japan and South Korea have all set ambitious goals to have millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by 2030.<br><br>Toyota and Hyundai are both offering hydrogen vehicles in the UK, but there are currently less than 20 hydrogen filling stations across the UK, mostly clustered around the M25.<br><br>\u201cIt will be really interesting to see what happens,\u201d says Lowes. But he himself is not convinced: \u201cHydrogen is much more expensive than electricity, and the car is more expensive than the electric vehicle.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Our ability to collect and record information in a digital form has exploded as has our adoption of AI systems, which use data to make decisions. But data isn\u2019t neutral, and sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are showing up in our data products. Catherine D\u2019Ignazio, an assistant professor of urban science and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), argues we need to do better. Along with Lauren Klein, who directs the Digital Humanities Lab at Emory University, she is the co-author of the new book <em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism\">Data Feminism</a></em>, which charts a course for a more equitable data science. D\u2019Ignazio also directs MIT\u2019s new Data and Feminism lab, which seeks to use data and computation to counter oppression<em>.</em></p> <p><strong>What is data feminism and why do we need it?<br></strong>It is data science with an intersectional feminist lens. It takes all inequality into account at every stage of the data processing pipeline, including gender discrimination but also other forms of intersecting discrimination like racism, classism and ableism. And the reason we need it is to stop producing harmful racist and sexist data products.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the sexist results coming out of these algorithms with the flawed data we are feeding in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>When you look at data and AI this way, what kind of problems do you find?<br></strong>We find some people are winning and some people are losing. The benefits and harms are not being equally distributed. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/13/ai-programs-exhibit-racist-and-sexist-biases-research-reveals\">those who are losing</a> are disproportionately women, people of colour, and other marginalised groups. One way they are losing is that data most of us would think is important isn\u2019t being collected. We have detailed datasets on things like the length of guinea pig teeth and items lost on the New York City subway. But, in the US, missing data includes maternal mortality data, which has only started being collected recently, and sexual harassment data. And so much of our health and medical understanding is based on research that has been done exclusively on the male body.</p> <p><strong>How do people with less privilege show up in datasets?<br></strong>We\u2019ve had facial analysis software that is much less accurate for dark-skinned women and algorithms that disadvantage female applicants. We\u2019ve also had child abuse prediction software that over-targets poor families and predictive policing software like PredPol that disproportionately targets neighbourhoods of colour. The former pulls data from state health and welfare services, which poor people are more likely to access, while the latter is based on historical crime data; only US policing practices have always disproportionately surveilled and patrolled neighbourhoods of colour. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the racist and sexist results coming out of these algorithms with the deeply flawed data we are feeding in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/25/healthcare-algorithm-racial-biases-optum\">Healthcare algorithm used across America has dramatic racial biases</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>If our data and algorithms are all so flawed, how do we change things to make them better?<br></strong>First we need to be tuning in to the ways that oppressive forces might be insidiously inserting themselves into the data pipeline. More understanding is particularly needed among the technical folks who are making these systems. It is rarely the case that the discrimination in products is intentional; it\u2019s just that nobody has ever taught them that it is a problem or emphasised that it is important. University data-science courses should include more than just a single ethics class.</p> <p>Then we have to actually use data and computation to challenge inequality. We have to collect counter-data. Take for example the comprehensive dataset on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/mexico-femicide-amlo-protests-strategy\">Mexico\u2019s femicides</a> \u2013 gender-related killings of women and girls \u2013 that has been compiled for the past five years from media reports by <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/how-one-woman-is-mapping-femicides-in-mexico/\">Mar\u00eda Salguero</a>, a citizen activist in that country. She is filling a vacuum because the Mexican government is not collecting the data. Now of course data alone is never enough. But if the data is used in concert with organising, lobbying and building political will, it can be very effective. In the US, we do have organisations working to call out injustice and produce their own counter-data, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/data4blacklives?lang=en\">Data for Black Lives</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ajlunited.org/\">Algorithmic Justice League</a> and <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/\">The Markup</a>. We need to fund more of this kind of work.</p> <p><strong>Is there </strong><strong>such thing as neutral data?<br></strong>There is a naive assumption that if you see numbers in a spreadsheet, they are real somehow. But data is never this raw, truthful input, and it is never neutral. It is information that has been collected in certain ways by certain actors and institutions for certain reasons. For example, there is a comprehensive database at the US federal level of sexual assaults on college campuses \u2013 colleges are required to report it. But whether students come forward to make those reports will depend on whether the college has a climate that will support survivors. Most colleges are not doing enough, and so we have vast underreporting of those crimes. It is not that data is evil or never useful, but the numbers should never be allowed to \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d because they don\u2019t tell the whole story when there are power imbalances in the collection environment.</p> <p><strong>Would data science\u2019s bias problems be solved if there were simply more data scientists, coders and computer programmers who were women or from minority backgrounds?<br></strong>More diversity is an important part of the solution. As a group, data scientists are more likely to be male, white and highly educated. They have never experienced sexism, racism or classism so it is hard for them to see it. We call this \u201cthe privilege hazard\u201d in the book and diversity can mitigate it.</p> <p>But only including more women or people of colour is not going to solve everything. We need to put communities who will be impacted by the information systems into the process of making them. Because inevitably designers and programmers are going to be building systems for life experiences that they haven\u2019t had. If everyone that builds a welfare application needs to have lived on welfare, that would be a high bar. Because I am a woman doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to understand how to build an application for domestic workers. But there are participation strategies from other fields like urban planning and how we incorporate those in data science is an area ripe for exploration.</p> <p><strong>In the book you talk about \u201cBig Dick Data\u201d. What is it and should we just reject it outright?<br></strong>We coined it to denote big data projects that are characterised by masculine fantasies of world domination. Big Dick Data projects fetishise large size and prioritise it, along with speed, over quality, ignore context and inflate their technical capabilities. They also tend to have little consideration for inequalities or inclusion in the process. Mark Zuckerberg aiming to supersede human senses with AI might be considered one such project, along with software company Palantir\u2019s claims about massive-scale datasets. Big Dick Data projects aren\u2019t necessarily wholly invalid, but they suck up resources that could be given smaller, more inclusive projects.</p> <p><strong>What would you most like people to think about or ask themselves when they encounter data or a graph in the media?<br></strong>A good general strategy and feminist practice is to ask what we call \u201cwho\u201d questions. Who made this? Who collected the data? Whose lives are embodied in the data? Who is it serving? Who is harmed potentially? Asking these questions allows us to start to see how privilege is baked in.</p> <p><strong>How is privilege being baked into the coronavirus data we are collecting?<br></strong>The US government\u2019s response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> has been a case of missing data. There has been community spread, but the numbers are completely unreliable because kits are in short supply and people are having a hard time getting tests. And then poor people, which include many from immigrant backgrounds, will be less likely to seek tests because of lack of insurance, lack of ability to afford insurance co-pays and lack of paid sick time if they test positive.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Data Feminism </em>by Catherine D\u2019Ignazio and Lauren F Klein is published by <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism\">MIT</a> (\u00a325)</p>",
  "<p>In many ways, Fennville, Michigan, represents the changing face of rural America.

In the intense and emotional discussion that followed, a picture of a racially divided town emerged. Many view Bolles\u2019s presence as a stain on the Hispanic-majority city of about 1,800 in western Michigan. Many others support him.</p> <p>Fennville\u2019s Hispanic residents account for about 51% of the city\u2019s population, and they are left to figure out how to respond to having a Proud Boy on the governing body. Those who spoke with the Guardian, however, say they are not afraid or angry. They are vigilant and watching, and they are also unsurprised.</p> <p>\u201cRacism is part of America \u2013 it\u2019s just who we are,\u201d said Sergio Reyes, a Fennville resident who moved to the US from Mexico about 40 years ago and describes himself as \u201cAmerican to the bone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good is that we know him, this is all out in the open, and you got people like myself who are willing to speak up on the problem,\u201d Reyes added. \u201cIf he does something racist in the open, now we can deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>Several Hispanic employees of a Fennville business who declined to give their name echoed that sentiment.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s America,\u201d one said. Another added that they were not particularly concerned as long as Bolles (pronounced \u201cbowls\u201d) wasn\u2019t pushing his views on the commission. \u201cWe just have to keep working and making a better life and not let it affect us.\u201d</p> <p>Fennville\u2019s Hispanic population grew in recent decades as migrants arrived for jobs in nearby fields, as well as those at a large facility owned by the food processing giant ConAgra. The strength in numbers is also reassuring, said another Hispanic Fennville resident who declined to give her name.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous group, it\u2019s a racist group, so of course some people are upset.

Fennville\u2019s city commissioner, Jim Hayden, said he \u201cfelt terrible\u201d when he learned of Bolles\u2019s membership . He and other commissioners said they were deceived by Bolles, who didn\u2019t mention the Proud Boys affiliation in interviews or his application.</p> <p>Bolles has previously said he didn\u2019t offer the information because no one asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just childish to say \u2018Nobody asked me\u2019,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cIf you have honor, dignity, respect and care about the job, then you tell the people interviewing you \u2018I\u2019ve got some things to tell you about\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Bolles isn\u2019t alone in his political ambitions on the far right.

Bolles\u2019s appointment is for two years, so it\u2019s likely that he will serve the term and voters can decide his fate in November 2021, Hayden said.</p> <p>It\u2019s also unclear that a recall would be successful. Many citizens on social media and in public meetings expressed a \u201cgive him a chance\u201d attitude. Reyes said that was \u201cproblematic\u201d and questioned if those residents would feel the same if a Latin Kings gang member were appointed to the commission.</p> <p>In the meantime, Bolles is helping make decisions about the minutiae that are part of running a small town. Fennville will soon need to replace its aerator, and it\u2019s considering selling a city-owned building to a medical marijuana company.

While the rest of the world discovers AFL and NRL and gets really into the A-League and W-League, we keep on pretending that things are semi-normal and watch a whole bunch of sport in a whole bunch of empty stadiums. So, let\u2019s go!</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Here\u2019s something unusual about Race Across the World (Sunday, 8pm, BBC Two), a sort of competitive gap year where five pairs compete to cross South America on the tightest budget in the shortest time in an effort to have the most annoying conversations back home with the people they know: I have ended up, against my better judgment, liking the contestants.</p> <p>Something about this feels fundamentally wrong. The TV arc I am used to is meeting various sets of people willing to participate in a reality TV programme, which already marks me against them (Step 1); making impulsive snap judgments based on accents, the way they look, or one slightly annoying thing they said in their intro reel (Step 2); spending more time with them and having my early impulses proved correct and, quite often, magnified (Step 3); then, in the final episode, watching one person win over all others and feeling nothing (Step 4). That is TV as I know it and how I like it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NWQVq9x_AM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7NWQVq9x_AM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So Race Across the World feels wrong. To recap: we are three weeks in, one couple down, nobody has a map or even a cursory grasp of Spanish and, somehow, they have rattled along from Mexico to Colombia without spending much more than a grand. There is Dom and Lizzie, the annoyingly-good-looking-in-that-really-healthy-way siblings who lost touch somewhere between childhood and university, who are bickering their way from boat to bus; Rob and Jen, married 33-year-olds from Reading hoping to overcome recent adversity by refinding themselves and each other; uncle-nephew combo Emon and Jamiul, who are staggeringly inept, and keep missing crucial buses because they are looking the wrong way; and Jo and Sam, my favourites, a 54-year-old and 19-year-old mother-son pair who guide each other tenderly through tantrums, distractions and the fact that he has seemingly never bought a bag of crisps unassisted in his life. I do not want to like a bunch of people sweating into backpacks and having the holiday of a lifetime. But here we are.</p> <p>Race Across the World is an astounding piece of TV because it somehow captures all the vibrant highs and exhausted lows of travel in all of their raw glory: the flooded hotels, the 18-hour coach trips, the moments of giving up, the bafflingly undesirable toilets, communicating in a nonsensical language halfway between English and Spanish; but then also the late-night beers, the dancing with strangers, the helpful locals hand-drawing a map on the back of a notepad, the ecstatic feeling of a comfortable bed.</p> <p>I salute every member of the camera crew. Not only do they have to document the entire round-the-houses trip each duo makes, they actually have to undergo it, too, and do it in a way that makes every missed bus feel like an urgent threat to you, the luxuriant viewer at home. They have also managed to finally take me to Step 5: genuinely caring how this one ends and the impact it will have on the lives of those who lived it. Not sure how I feel about that. Going to chain a few episodes of Ibiza Weekender to get back on a level of literally not caring about the fates of the people I\u2019ve just watched entertain me.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018You mustn\u2019t miss the dock dung,\u201d said our friend Jeremy. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to wait till lunchtime for the avocets,\u201d added his partner Trish.</p> <p>Those words had rung in our ears as we stepped off the Tamar Valley train at Bere Alston station, ready to walk a 6\u00bd-mile route to Bere Ferrers, where we would stop for a picnic outside the <a href=\"http://www.theoldeploughinn.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Olde Plough Inn</a>. We were in the Bere peninsula, a part of south-west Devon that is bypassed by many but which in spring, with flowers in abundance, amazing river views and enticing bird life, is a walker\u2019s paradise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d3ac422bb05acafdeb15c02c34b1e1c8e9a320e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3ac422bb05acafdeb15c02c34b1e1c8e9a320e/1_5_868_595/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tamar valley map\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The last time I had been in these parts was in 2003, when I was making a TV series about the river with Dartmoor photographer Chris Chapman, and he was my companion again today. The sky was clear as we set off from the station, initially heading north-west towards Calstock to join a public footpath through woodland down to the river that forms the border with Cornwall, the Tamar.</p> <p>The morning sun was warm on our backs as we crossed a meadow and a stream then rejoined the woodland. Ramsons, or wild garlic, wood anemone and primrose were in abundance alongside daffodils and violets. The plethora of colour was a clue to the history of these slopes. At one time these now-wooded valleys were carpeted with soft fruits and commercial daffodils, and dotted with orchards. From the mid-19th century, trees had been cleared by enterprising people to make room for market gardens that sent early fruits and flowers to Britain\u2019s towns and cities, an industry for which the peninsula became famous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bb638313d0053466c582c997d75d2894c85a992\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb638313d0053466c582c997d75d2894c85a992/0_0_5200_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Calstock Viaduct.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Calstock Viaduct.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Hill/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two forces had helped them. The steep sides of the Tamar Valley were perfect for growing soft fruit and flowers, and thanks to the tidal nature of the river, the area was almost immune to frosts. River barges brought manure and other detritus from the dockyards of Plymouth and Devonport \u2013 the \u201cdock dung\u201d that Jeremy had mentioned. This, spread on the slopes, proved highly nutritious for the bulbs and fruits, but the public health authorities were not so impressed. By 1920 dock dung had been banned, though as Jeremy said, you can still find all sorts of bits and pieces \u2013 glass, ceramic, shells, even marbles, relics of the dock dung days \u2013 scattered in the ground. As we walked, we picked up a fragment of blue-patterned porcelain and a chunk of old glass.</p> <p>If the valley provided the perfect environment for the market gardens, railways provided the means for the perishable stuff to get to market. In 1890, the London and South Western Railway opened a line from Waterloo to Plymouth that went via Bere Alston. Growers could get their perishable but sought-after products into London overnight and for generations they prospered.</p> <p>Then, on 6 May 1968, another historic railway decision, the wielding of Dr Beeching\u2019s axe, closed the line and pretty much killed the industry (leaving Bere Alston to be served by the Tamar Valley branch line only). Today there are only a handful of growers left. Many of the former gardens have reverted to nature, leaving a huge variety of daffodils to compete with the woodland for spring light. Luckily for us, the blooms succeed rather well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f22e6d6f83aac3f18594b3186aaf304859fcd0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f22e6d6f83aac3f18594b3186aaf304859fcd0e/0_72_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looking towards Kit Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking towards Kit Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Treesme/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We followed the path through the flowers to the river, where we marvelled at the wonderful piece of Edwardian civil engineering that is Calstock viaduct. Built between 1904 and 1907, it rises majestically 37 metres above the Tamar, carrying the railway across the river. The morning sun was perfect; the arches stood out against a brilliant sky above the slate grey of the river, so still it glided past us like silk. Water reeds swayed in the gentle breeze \u2013 a perfect spring morning.</p> <p>A permissive footpath enabled us to stay alongside the river for a mile or so then, as the path climbed across the valley, our view of the river changed. Behind us we looked back to the Cornish side, the Tamar nestled in its steep-sided valley. Kit Hill, with its decorated chimney, stood out on the horizon, a reminder of another industry that once dominated the area \u2013 silver and copper mining. In front of us the river veered south-west and slipped out of sight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f14fd1cbb8892a45c531bee01ec252ce748595f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f14fd1cbb8892a45c531bee01ec252ce748595f/0_127_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dock dung\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dock dung consists of manure and debris from more than a century ago swept up with it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We climbed over a couple of stiles and walked along the edge of a not-so-pretty site. The fields in front of us had the remains of a crop of maize. It\u2019s used as animal feed but makes a mess of the landscape: \u201csubsidised soil destruction\u201d is what the Soil Association calls it. We dropped down into more woodland and crossed another reed-filled stream emptying into the Tamar. Bright, diamond-like flashes of light played on the water as the rays of the sun pierced the leaf cover. Walking in these wet areas was easier than we imagined: there are plenty of boards across the streams so your boots stay dry. Then came the only steep climb on the walk \u2013 a heart-pumping 20 minutes.</p> <p>We crossed a road and a field, over yet another stile and into more woodland. And what a picture it was. There were daffodils everywhere, swaying gently in the breeze. Lit by shafts of sunlight streaming through the trees, they resembled performers on a stage. As we gazed at the scene in this steep woodland valley, we could only admire the ingenuity of the community that once cultivated it. They\u2019d had to design special tools to prepare, sow and harvest flowers on such treacherous slopes. Some had employed dynamite as well as axes and picks to clear the trees. And yet the speed with which nature had recolonised these formerly manicured gardens was perhaps even more impressive.</p> <p>There were once more than 100 daffodil varieties in the Tamar Valley, so it\u2019s worth coming with a <a href=\"http://www.tamarvalley.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Daff-ID-text-with-photos.pdf\" title=\"\">visual guide</a>. The season lasts up to five months, so you could see the impressive yellow trumpet, the emperor, the smaller and softer lent lily (one of Wordsworth\u2019s \u201chost of golden daffodils\u201d), or one of the whites, maybe the ice folly. But the daffodil that made the area famous, the perfectly formed Tamar double white, doesn\u2019t come out until late May. Dispatched to London wrapped in soft, blue tissue-lined boxes, it sealed the reputation of the peninsula as a producer of fine-quality flowers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e2bd2ecca89e4c12cb721848862bf6069698b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e2bd2ecca89e4c12cb721848862bf6069698b5c/88_263_3944_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn over the Tamar at South Hooe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dawn over the Tamar at South Hooe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leaving the wood, we met the road at Weir Quay and were struck by just how dramatically the river had changed from the one we had seen 30 minutes before. It had become a wide, sweeping tidal flow. Grey mudflats stretched out in front of us. Cornwall now seemed an awfully long way away. What had happened here was climate change. The whole area had been transformed thousands of years ago when, at the end of the last ice age, melting ice and rising sea levels had drowned river valleys across south-west England, creating wide, shallow tidal estuaries or rias (coastal inlets) like the Tamar.</p> <p>We walked along the road out of Weir Quay as the tide was going out. Small dinghies, these days used just at weekends, looked desolate, marooned in the mud. The river was quiet but the ruins of a lime kiln and a steam-pumping engine house reminded us how busy it used to be. At one time, myriad sailing barges, designed especially for this river, brought in tons of limestone. It was burned in kilns dotted along the quays to produce lime used to \u201csweeten\u201d the fields and improve crop yields. The same boats took away thousands of tons of locally mined copper and silver ore and loaded at the quays we had passed on the walk. Looking at this stunning but deserted landscape, it was hard to believe that in the 19th century the Tamar had been one of the busiest rivers in the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d34f56658b1f4acb2c25b4cfc95994678dfcba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d34f56658b1f4acb2c25b4cfc95994678dfcba9/0_501_1504_902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daffodils in the Tamar Valley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Today this stretch is a good place to spot wading birds, so we rested a while on a bench, binoculars at the ready. We were not disappointed. We saw a couple of pairs of shelducks and a solitary little egret feeding in the shallows. We heard the distinctive call of the oystercatcher. A cormorant flew upstream while redshanks, with their bright orange legs and bills, busied themselves probing the mud for molluscs and small crustaceans. Then we spotted the black-and-white markings and curled beaks of a small colony of avocets, backlit by the afternoon sun. I now saw what Trish had meant when she said we\u2019d have to wait till lunchtime for the avocets. They feed on the mudflats as the tide empties the river. We\u2019d got there just in time.</p> <p>It was lunchtime for us, too, so we pressed on, following the road as it twisted and turned up the hill past what used to be Clamoak Farm, where the double white was first cultivated in the 1880s by a farmer called Septimus Jackson. (Surely there should be a plaque?) As we dropped into another creek, we followed the watercourse and a dammed pond, pretty much overgrown with alder and willow but with water lilies bursting through. There were more waders as the creek found its way through the reed beds to join the river. We made a sharp turn to the left, walked up the hill, looking back at slow-moving water for one final lingering moment, then through a couple of gates and into Bere Ferrers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66c7e195206a0a7f819398ffc8e7997fbe98d6ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66c7e195206a0a7f819398ffc8e7997fbe98d6ba/0_228_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamar Valley Tamar River\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was hard to believe that in the 19th century the River Tamar had been one of the busiest rivers in the country\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the way to the pub we passed the village hall and on the other side of the road called in on the village hairdresser Margaret Willmott, great-granddaughter of Septimus Jackson, who told us about her family\u2019s involvement in the market gardening. Margaret is a mainstay of the annual March flower show in the village, which celebrates the flower that sealed the reputation of the Bere peninsula. After a walk of four hours we finally arrived outside the Olde Plough Inn.

I feel good about it. That\u2019s all it is, it\u2019s a feeling.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was then Alexander asked for Trump\u2019s message to people who are feeling scared and the president snapped: \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cYou\u2019re doing sensationalism \u2026 That\u2019s really bad reporting.

He merely echoed his boss\u2019s dissatisfaction with the media. He also joined Trump in using the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d.</p> \n<p>Introducing Pompeo, Trump referred to \u201cthe deep state department\u201d, referring to a favourite conspiracy theory which holds that a network of bureaucrats and intelligence officials exists to frustrate the president\u2019s agenda, but which Steve Bannon, who has promoted the theory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/03/trump-steve-bannon-deep-state-conspiracy-theory\">has said is for \u201cnut cases\u201d</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/1241044023445524481\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Note Fauci\u2019s reaction when Trump makes a deep state joke at the podium <a href=\"https://t.co/cbNBxgqhRO\">pic.twitter.com/cbNBxgqhRO</a></p>\u2014 Brandon Wall (@Walldo) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/1241044023445524481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>On the podium, Dr Fauci glanced at the president, smiled ruefully, brushed his brow and rubbed his jaw in thought.</p> \n<p>Adding to the strange atmosphere, Sean Spicer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sean-spicer\">the former White House press secretary</a>, was sitting in the briefing room in a seat normally occupied by the Guardian and asked a couple of questions.

Because the ship had only travelled between Sydney and New Zealand, it was deemed a low risk of people carrying the virus. People were allowed to disembark, but four people from the ship later tested positive for Covid-19, leaving NSW Health scrambling to alert the other 2,700 passengers onboard.<br><br>Sheppeard said the ship did not have Covid-19 testing capacity onboard but did have flu testing.

  "<p>Long before the arrival of Covid-19, the speed and contents of the news had made me feel almost overwhelmed with fear. Faced with a flood of images that includes migrant children in cages, melting glaciers and forest fires, it has felt impossible to process information, let alone assess the best way to react.</p> <p>We\u2019ve entered an era characterised by the twin forces of speed and instability, in which a superabundance of potential threats \u2013 running from Islamic State to nuclear war, the rise of the far right, Brexit, environmental catastrophe and now a global pandemic \u2013 is matched by a dearth of time in which to process them. It\u2019s impossible to keep up, and far too alarming to look away. Thanks to the accelerating effects of social media, it\u2019s begun to seem as if the social landscape is shifting at such a rate that thinking, the act of making sense, is permanently balked. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to distinguish real danger from rumours, speculations, conspiracy theories and deliberate lies, a process the spread of coronavirus around the globe has only intensified. Logging into Twitter or following the rolling news has meant being trapped in a spin-cycle of hypervigilant anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During this febrile period, I\u2019ve found myself longing for a different kind of timeframe, in which it would be possible both to feel and to think, to process the intense impact of the news and perhaps even to imagine other ways of being. The stopped time of a painting, say, or the dilations of the novel, in which it is possible to see patterns and consequences that are otherwise invisible. Art has begun to feel not like a respite or an escape, but a formidable tool for gaining perspective on what are increasingly troubled times.</p> <p>Can art do anything, especially during periods of crisis? In 1967, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/george-steiner-obituary\" title=\"\">George Steiner</a> wrote a famous essay about the deficiencies of art in the wake of the Holocaust. He argued that if a concentration camp commander could read Goethe and Rilke in the evening and still go about their duties at Auschwitz each day, then art had failed in its highest function, which he defined as the ability to humanise. The problem with this argument is that it implies for art to be successful it must act as a magic bullet, effortlessly reorganising moral faculties; in effect obliterating free will.</p> <p>Art can\u2019t forcibly induce a change in behaviour. It\u2019s not a re-education pill. Empathy is not something that happens to us when we read <em>War and Peace</em>. It\u2019s work, for which art can, however, provide us with radiant materials. Art can\u2019t win an election or bring down a president. It can\u2019t stop the climate crisis, cure a virus or raise the dead. What it can do is serve as an antidote to times of chaos. It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think.</p> <p>One of the problems with the internet as a source of information is that there is no end, no definitive conclusion to be reached. You travel link by link, pursuing digressions and counter-claims, interrupted by continuous breaking updates. The novel, by contrast, is a technology of orderly revelation, slowing and speeding time so as to trace connections and consequences down into hours, minutes, seconds, or out into decades, even centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca/0_111_2050_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The TV adaptation of Bleak House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The TV adaptation of<em> </em>Bleak House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Mike Hogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dickens is the master of this, and it strikes me that there can\u2019t be many better figurations for what information-gathering feels like on social media than Krook\u2019s Rag and Bottle shop in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\" title=\"\">Bleak House</a></em>. This \u201cgeneral emporium of much disregarded merchandise\u201d is overflowing with indeterminate objects, among them blacking bottles and pickling bottles, heaps of parchment scrolls, rags and hundreds of rusty keys. Buried somewhere in this maddening chaos is, or might be, a vital document, without which clarity and justice will never be achieved.</p> <p>There\u2019s a plague in <em>Bleak House</em> too, the hyper-contagious smallpox virus, which serves to underscore Dickens\u2019s larger argument about interconnection, his determined attempt to show that social classes are not inviolate or impermeable, and that no group of people, no matter how grand or rich, are truly separate from their neighbours, no matter how poor or abject. The fever doesn\u2019t respect titles or addresses, racing indiscriminately from the London slum of Tom-All-Alone to Bleak House itself. Esther catches it because she insists on helping the abject, homeless orphan Jo, shivering and stumbling from ditch to doorway, always being moved on. Realising she too is sick, she establishes herself in rigorous quarantine, knowing that by locking the door on her dear friend Ada, she is carrying out an act of love. \u201cAs she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace,\u201d she instructs, \u201ccome no nearer than the garden\u201d: the tender message of self-isolators everywhere.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of <em>Bleak House</em> is that it\u2019s a drama about the act of information-gathering itself, slowly and laboriously producing clarity and order out of lies, misinformation and occlusion. Back in the early 1990s, the critic and queer studies pioneer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick wrote an illuminating essay about this vexed and essential process. Sedgwick was once described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson</a> as \u201cfat, freckled, prone to blushing, bedecked in textiles, generous, uncannily sweet, almost sadistically intelligent and, by the time I met her, terminally ill\u201d. She wrote \u201cParanoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You\u201d at the centre of the Aids crisis, at a time when many of her closest friends and colleagues were dying difficult and painful deaths, and she herself was undergoing treatment for the breast cancer that later killed her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading The Road does not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though it was written predominantly for an academic audience, \u201cParanoid Reading\u201d is about something that affects us all, which is how we approach knowledge and uncertainty, as we do constantly in the course of our daily lives, and particularly at times of disaster or rapid political change. Sedgwick begins by describing the paranoid approach, so common and widely practised that we sometimes forget there are alternatives to it.</p> <p>A paranoid reader is concerned with gathering information, tracing links and exposing secrets. They anticipate and are perennially defended against catastrophe and disappointment. They\u2019re always on the lookout for danger, about which they can never, ever know enough. Paranoia can be an appropriate mode in circumstances like those we\u2019re in now, when knowledge is crucial and swift reactions matter. As the poet Anne Boyer observes in a much-shared essay about coronavirus, \u201cfear educates our care for each other \u2013 we fear a sick person might be made sicker, or that a poor person\u2019s life might be made even more miserable, and we do whatever we can to protect them because we fear a version of human life in which everyone lives only for themselves. I am not the least bit afraid of this kind of fear, for fear is a vital and necessary part of love.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulty lies in gauging the level and amount of information it\u2019s useful to acquire. How much does the average citizen need to know about epidemiology or viral loads? Does the accumulated store of possible scenarios help a person to act safely or does it paralyse their capacity to act at all? Furthermore, how much of what is read is true, and how much is being used to convey a more sinister message, like Trump\u2019s constant harping on a \u201cforeign\u201d virus, his deployment of a disease to broadcast propaganda about closed borders? At their worst, Twitter, Facebook and the like can be a factory for manufacturing speculation and mistrust, in which material travels more rapidly the more frightening it is, providing comprehensive evidence for hopelessness and dread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d/0_0_4254_4278/994.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden on the beach in his final years.\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden, see below, on the beach in his final years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Krause, Johansen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sedgwick\u2019s essay arose out of a conversation in the mid-1980s with her friend Cindy Patton, an activist-historian of the Aids epidemic. At the time, there were rumours that Aids might have been deliberately engineered by the US military. Sedgwick was excited to hear what Patton thought and startled by her reply. \u201cSuppose \u2026 that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they aren\u2019t actively hated; that the military deliberately researches ways to kill non-combatants whom it sees as enemies; that people in power look calmly on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes,\u201d she said. \u201cSupposing we were ever so sure of all those things \u2013 what would we know then that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3/0_251_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Bird/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Sedgwick took away from this \u201ccongenial pessimism\u201d, which strikes a definite echo with the present day, is that it isn\u2019t always necessary to track down every piece of information about a crisis in order to respond effectively to it. Patton\u2019s statement made her realise that there are other valid concerns for the artist, the activist, the citizen faced by emergency or disaster. At the very end of her essay, she briefly, tantalisingly floats another possible approach, which is more concerned with creativity and repair than the so-called hermeneutics of suspicion.</p> <p>A useful analogy for what Sedgwick terms the \u201creparative\u201d is to be fundamentally more invested in finding nourishment than identifying poison, a drive she locates in artists as diverse as the realist painter Jack Smith, artist Joseph Cornell, film-maker John Waters and <em>Nightwood</em> author Djuna Barnes. This is not the same thing as being naive or heedless, unaware of crisis or undamaged by oppression. Instead, it\u2019s about being driven to find or invent something new and vital out of inimical environments. \u201cWhat we can best learn from such practices,\u201d Sedgwick explains, \u201care the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture \u2013 even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.\u201d</p> <p>Sedgwick\u2019s faith in art was hard-won, and derived in part from the crucial role it played during the plague years of the Aids crisis. In contrast to the rapid international public health response to coronavirus, the first cases of \u201cgay cancer\u201d in California and New York in 1981 were met with apathy and derision. In 1984, by which time 5,596 deaths had occurred in the US and it was estimated 300,000 people had been exposed to the virus, the Reagan press officer was still responding to questions about the epidemic by joking about the journalist\u2019s possible infection status. Reagan himself didn\u2019t say the word \u201cAids\u201d until 17 September 1985. By the end of that year, 12,529 people had died.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/29/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2020\">Fiction to look out for in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such a situation, visibility mattered. In 1987, a six-person collective of artists in New York created the \u201cSilence = Death\u201d graphic, which became the international logo of Aids activism. This stark phrase was emblazoned in white letters on a black background beneath a pink triangle, taken from the insignia homosexuals were made to wear in concentration camps. It served to brand the call to arms, a crisp refutation of stigmatisation and homophobia.</p> <p>If silence equalled death, then part of the work of resistance was to make the fact of enforced silencing visible, as well as conveying something of the damage it caused. In 1989, the American artist and Act Up activist David Wojnarowicz posed for a famous photograph. He gazes furiously at the camera, his lips sutured with five loose stitches. Three thin trickles of blood run down his chin. In this distressing image, hurt and repair are fused. The needle works through flesh, self-inflicted wounds announcing larger harm.</p> <p>In our own era, the act of lip-sewing has been adopted by refugees. I\u2019ve seen photographs of refugees with stitched lips made on the border between Greece and Macedonia, in an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea, in Athens; all places where borders are closed to certain bodies and free passage is impeded. In these cases, the image possesses an uncanny power. It can travel where the body can\u2019t. It migrates and strays, taking up permanent residence in the mind, revealing what \u2013 who \u2013 has been forcibly excluded from sight.</p> <p>The desire to unveil hidden cruelty is also at work in a series of performances about rape carried out in the early 1970s by the Cuban-American artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/22/ana-mendieta-artist-work-foretold-death\" title=\"\">Ana Mendieta</a>, while she was still a student at the University of Iowa. In 1973, a nursing student was brutally raped and murdered in campus housing. It took months before there was an arrest, and during that frightening period, Mendieta took it upon herself to create work about the attack, conveying her own horror, as well as drawing attention to the invisible epidemic of violence against women. In the first of these performances, she invited her fellow students to her apartment. When they arrived, the door was ajar. Inside, there was lavish evidence that a horrible crime had been committed. Mendieta was tied to the table, half-naked, her underwear around her ankles. Blood dripped on the floor. The students stayed an hour and for the entire time she didn\u2019t move a muscle.</p> <p>Mendieta was working right at the beginning of second-wave feminism, when it was still possible to believe in the power of revelation, the shock tactics of re-enacting violence as a vaccination, a homeopathic cure. But by the 1990s, Sedgwick was already beginning to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t something weirdly naive about placing faith in this kind of unveiling, \u201cas though to make something visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from getting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction\u201d. As if violence is not titillating to certain appetites; as if the expression of pain cannot be consumed with relish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1/0_69_1503_902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Kraychyk/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The faith in inoculation remains, of course. In 2017, the actor Elisabeth Moss announced her irritation with people who refused to watch the ultra-violent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\" title=\"\">Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em>, a dystopic fantasy that felt closer by the day. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.\u201d But in the age of the internet, it\u2019s very hard to think that anyone needs more evidence of violence. We\u2019re already drenched in it, and its capacity to snap us out of numbness is grossly overstated. If anything, it does the opposite, glutting the viewer with despair.</p> <p>The night before Trump\u2019s inauguration, I saw the trans poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/16/eileen-myles-learn-to-write-poems\" title=\"\">Eileen Myles</a> read their own version of a presidential address at the London Review Bookshop. The vision they unfolded was the utopian inverse \u2013 painful! thrilling! \u2013 of what Trump would say the following day. Under Myles, the White House would be a homeless shelter, there\u2019d be 24-hour libraries, free trains, free education, free food, archery for everyone; sure, why not? It felt reparative, listening to that. It felt like my imaginative ability to frame utopias and then to move purposefully towards them might have been restored, at least for a minute.</p> <p>I had the same experience when I first read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/27/ursula-k-le-guins-electronica-album-music-and-poetry-of-the-kesh\" title=\"\">Always Coming Home</a></em>, Ursula Le Guin\u2019s 1985 collection of stories and anthropological fragments about a future civilisation, the Kesh, living in what is now California\u2019s Napa Valley in the wake of an apocalypse that is never quite described. It was a relief to encounter such a formidable thinker using her imaginative energy, her humour and her extensive knowledge to construct a better, fairer, more environmentally sane society \u2013 its architecture, sexual arrangements, metaphors, toys, songs, clothes, medical practices and stories \u2013 rather than simply magnifying all that is worst about our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/17/best-books-new-beginnings-jenny-colgan\">The best books about new beginnings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading <em>The Road</em> or <em>The Death of Grass</em> does not. Le Guin was no less concerned about the oncoming ecological crisis than Cormac McCarthy, but her approach is calmer and more infused with hope. Hope has a bad press in our cynical age, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being disengaged, a Pollyanna blind to the state things are in or uninterested in how they got that way. Hope is the precursor to change. Without it, no better world is possible.</p> <p>The same year that Wojnarowicz was photographed with his needle and thread, the film-maker Derek Jarman began the diary that would become <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\" title=\"\">Modern Nature</a></em>, an account of building his famous garden on the beach in Dungeness, Kent. Jarman was diagnosed HIV-positive in the winter of 1986, years before the invention of combination therapy made long-term survival a probability. In the face of his own oncoming death, he didn\u2019t give way to despair. Instead he elected to spend his time making this stony desert bloom.</p> <p>He planted irises and roses directly into the shingle, encouraging a riot of wallflowers and valerian, \u201call the dark humours blown away by the wind\u201d. This wild, unfenced arcadia sustained him through the political battles of his final years, and has now outlived him by more than quarter of a century. Last time I visited, in December, it was still humming with power.</p> <p>I have the same feeling when I look at photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans or read a novel by Ali Smith. I had it when I went to see my friend Rich\u2019s degree show at Goldsmiths and he\u2019d made dozens of ceramic razor clams and anemones, downed planes and nubbly coral reefs. It\u2019s a feeling of being inducted back into hope, a restoration of faith. It\u2019s easy to give into despair. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s frightening, so much that\u2019s wrong. But if this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat, even when we can\u2019t touch. Art is a place where that can happen, where ideas and people are made welcome.

The independent review was in response to mounting evidence that members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2018/apr/17/who-are-the-windrush-generation-video-explainer\">Windrush generation</a> were losing jobs, homes and access to benefits, as well as being denied NHS treatment, detained, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/10/windrush-people-wrongly-deported-jamaica-criminal-offence\">forcibly deported</a> to countries they left as children.</p> <p>The findings, alongside the testimonies of black British citizens affected by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">environment</a>, are truly anguishing.</p> <p>Wendy Williams, the HM inspector of constabulary<strong> </strong>appointed as the independent reviewer, has examined the key legislative, policy and operational decisions that led to the Windrush injustices, and spoken to those who suffered grave and catastrophic consequences from becoming entangled in the government\u2019s hostile immigration policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-windrush-scandal-a-result-of-a-hostile-environment\">The Guardian view on the Windrush scandal: a result of a hostile environment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Williams\u2019 review <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/18/windrush-inquiry-report-submitted-to-home-secretary\">draws a stark conclusion</a>: the UK\u2019s treatment of the Windrush generation, and approach to immigration more broadly, was caused by institutional failures to understand race and racism. Their failures conform to certain aspects of Lord Macpherson\u2019s definition of institutional racism, enshrined in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">Macpherson report</a> into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, published in 1999.</p> <p>Macpherson defined <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277111/4262.pdf\">institutional racism</a> as: \u201cThe collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.\u201d</p> <p>The Windrush Lessons Learned review pulls no punches in describing the failure of ministers and officials to understand the nature of racism in Britain. It shows how the government\u2019s hostile environment immigration policies had devastating impacts on the lives and families of black citizens within the UK.</p> <p>It is hard to forget the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">Michael Braithwaite</a>, who came from Barbados to the UK as a nine year-old, more than 50 years ago. Thinking that he was British, Braithwaite never applied for a passport \u2013 but in 2017, after the implementation of the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts, he suddenly lost his job as a special needs teaching assistant in a school where he had worked for more than 15 years. Michael had been living in the UK legally his entire life, but he lost his much-loved job and livelihood because he could not prove his citizenship status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17b11fb825dcd5b69651140fe3b2c09535bc1404\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17b11fb825dcd5b69651140fe3b2c09535bc1404/0_177_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest against  immigration policy outside the Home Office in London, April 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The government\u2019s hostile environment immigration policies had devastating impacts on the lives and families of black citizens within the UK.\u2019 <br>Demonstrators protest against immigration policy outside the Home Office in London, April 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that black British people who had spent much of their lives in Britain, working and paying taxes, were accidental victims of the government\u2019s immigration policies, perfectly illustrates how the coalition and Conservative governments not only failed to adhere to existing race relations legislation, but also showed a complete lack of understanding about \u201cindirect discrimination\u201d \u2013 a concept accepted in legislation as far back as the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/74/enacted\">1976 Race Relations Act</a>.</p> <p>Neither that lesson of \u201cunintended discrimination\u201d, nor the definition of \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d from the Macpherson report, seem to have been learned by Britain\u2019s policymakers and politicians. Not only is intent irrelevant for assessing whether policies are racially discriminatory, but race equality laws (including the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/34/contents\">2000 Race Relations Amendment Act</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/public-sector-equality-duty\">public sector equality duty</a>) appear to have made little difference to immigration and citizenship policies affecting people from different ethnic groups.</p> <p>This reveals a shocking lack of understanding of what racism is \u2013 namely that it\u2019s not solely about intent. In April 2018, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/uk-still-uncertain-about-windrush-era-deportations\">dramatic apology</a> by the then prime minister, Theresa May, showed a failure to understand this lesson, when she insisted it wasn\u2019t her government\u2019s <em>intent</em> to disproportionately affect people from the Caribbean in the operation of hostile environment immigration policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-scandal-from-offhand-denial-to-mays-shamefaced-apology\">Windrush scandal: from offhand denial to May's shamefaced apology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For policymakers and politicians to learn the profound lessons of the Windrush review, they must not only \u201cright the wrongs\u201d suffered by the Windrush generation (as well as those from other ethnic minority groups), but they must also understand how and why immigration and citizenship policies, and Home Office culture, have repeatedly discriminated against black and ethnic minority citizens over the decades.</p> <p>The Windrush generation are owed a full apology \u2013 an apology that is based on understanding that their treatment wasn\u2019t an accidental misfortune, but the result of institutional failure to understand the role of race and racism in Britain.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Dr Zubaida Haque is deputy director of the <a href=\"http://www.runnymedetrust.org/\">Runnymede Trust</a>.

  "<p>You can\u2019t work because of illness. Or your wedding has to be cancelled. Or you\u2019ve been made redundant and can\u2019t pay the mortgage. Or your tenant has stopped paying the rent. These and hundreds of other situations are often covered by insurance contracts. But as coronavirus sweeps the world, will the insurers pay out?</p> <p>Until now the focus has been on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-holidays-travel-insurance-gigs-flight-cancelled\">travel insurance</a>, but as the economic impact of the virus is taking hold, other types of insurance come into play.

Given that spring and early summer are the peak season for weddings, there will be a lot of people wanting to claim if they took out a policy. Big providers include John Lewis and Debenhams, and specialist including Emerald Life.</p> <p><em>Will it pay out for coronavirus?</em></p> <p>Couples who wanted to get married are now being tied in knots by the wording in these insurance policies. For example, the John Lewis policy says explicitly it will pay out for cancellation caused by \u201cthe booked venue for the wedding or wedding reception being unable to hold your wedding due to an outbreak of infectious or contagious disease\u201d.</p> <p>A lot of couples will think, great, surely we will get a payout. But it\u2019s not that simple \u2013 and distraught couples are finding their claims are being rejected.</p> <p>Why? Because weddings have not been banned by the government. If the wedding venue itself does not cancel the event the John Lewis policy will not pay out.</p> <p>John Lewis says: \u201cThe current UK government position is that \u2026 weddings are still permitted to take place. So if your wedding venue is still prepared to hold your wedding and you chose to cancel, then this would not be covered.\u201d</p> <p>John Lewis also warns couples against cancelling without minimising losses \u2013 for example, asking suppliers such as venues, cake makers, photographers etc, to give refunds, or to rebook at a later date. \u201cWe may ask you to provide copies of your venue and supplier contracts as well as relevant correspondence with them, and may refuse cover in the event that we consider that you have not adequately minimised your costs.\u201d</p> <p>John Lewis will pay out if a person central to the wedding \u2013 bride, bridegroom, very close family etc \u2013 has contracted coronavirus. But if a key person is self-isolating without an actual diagnosis it won\u2019t pay out.</p> <p>The company has, inevitably, stopped selling wedding insurance, and its treatment of customers during this period will no doubt be noted by other couples arranging their nuptials in future.</p> <p>Emerald Life kept selling wedding insurance until 18 March, although only for weddings taking place in or after October, but it has also now closed its doors. It said: \u201cWhat we are doing is talking through whether customers can rearrange as a practical measure. Most venues and suppliers seem to want to help, and we will then just move their wedding date forward and extend the wedding coverage at no extra charge.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Income protection cover</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2256f29e00c8c9aaa5e72c40c89c94402398c557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2256f29e00c8c9aaa5e72c40c89c94402398c557/0_92_4256_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fridge magnets with mortgage payment reminder note\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will your insurance pay out if you have to stay home with coronavirus, but can\u2019t get a diagnosis?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>What is it?</em></p> <p>The insurers promise that an income protection policy will give you a monthly income if you can\u2019t work because you are ill or injured, and in some cases if you are made unemployed. It pays a proportion of your lost earnings (usually around two-thirds of your former salary), with the payments continuing until you return to paid work or you retire.</p> <p>Policies are sold with \u201cwaiting periods\u201d. The more expensive ones let you claim the moment you can\u2019t work, while the cheaper (and more widely sold) don\u2019t pay out until after a month or so. The typical monthly cost is about \u00a360 to \u00a380.</p> <p><em>Will it pay out for coronavirus?</em></p> <p>When we contacted LV=, one of the UK\u2019s biggest providers, it said it had yet to receive a coronavirus-related claim. But it added that it would stand by the policies and pay claims as they arise.</p> <p>It said: \u201cWhile coronavirus is an unprecedented global pandemic, we recognise that it is already changing lives of everyday individuals and families. Income protection insurance has, and will have, a role to play, offering valuable reassurance and a much-needed financial safety net.\u201d</p> <p>For a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus, LV= said: <strong>\u201c</strong>We\u2019ll assess and pay their claim in the usual way, reflecting their chosen waiting period and the policy terms and conditions.\u201d</p> <p>But what if you have not been given a diagnosis, but have to stop working and self-isolate? If you are self-employed, that means you immediately lose income. Can you claim?</p> <p>LV= said that for its Personal Sick Pay plan holders with a day-zero and week-one waiting period, it would consider claims for medically advised self isolation. It adds: \u201cThese are highly unusual circumstances, so any decision and payment we make for self isolation will be outside of the normal terms and conditions. \u2026 We\u2019ll make decisions immediately and any payments we make for self-isolation (current guidance is for up to 14 days from contact) will be in our member\u2019s bank account within a couple of days.\u201d LV= policies do not include cover for unemployment.</p> <p>It said it is still selling the policies, but that is under constant review.</p> <p>When we put the same questions to Aviva, another major provider of income protection policies, its response was a bit tougher.</p> <p>Aviva confirmed that customers with coronavirus who are unable to work past the waiting period will receive payouts according to the policy terms.</p> <p>But it added that its policies did not cover any other reasons why customers couldn\u2019t carry out their occupation, such as employer or government restrictions around self isolation, though it added it would look at \u201ceach case individually to determine the best outcome for their circumstances\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Rental guarantee insurance</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5fd1b665480435add116cc415587a74cf767b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5fd1b665480435add116cc415587a74cf767b47/0_166_5146_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monopoly Money on Monopoly board\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Landlords are soon going to find out how good their rent guarantee insurance is.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daisy Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>What is it</em></p> <p>Direct Line is a big seller of landlord insurance, and offers an add-on called rent guarantee insurance. As the Direct Line marketing says: \u201cWe\u2019ll provide cover for any unpaid rent if you have to repossess your property. If your tenants can\u2019t pay, we will.\u201d</p> <p>Claims can be made once the rent has been overdue for at least one month, and landlords can claim as much as \u00a3250,000.</p> <p><em>Will it pay out for coronavirus?</em></p> <p>This is going to be a very interesting one. Currently, Direct Line says: \u201cOnce the tenant has not paid rent for 30 days and the relevant section 21 or section 8 notice has been issued, then you can claim.\u201d</p> <p>A section 21 notice is the standard eviction notice used by landlords. But on 18 March the government banned all evictions. So it puts landlords in a catch-22. They have insurance that will pay out if a tenant defaults, but can only claim if they evict the tenant, and that is now banned for the moment.</p> <p>Direct Line said: \u201cThe situation with coronavirus is unprecedented, and the actions of the landlord will vary depending on the circumstances they are faced with and those facing the tenant. Just because a landlord has rent guarantee cover doesn\u2019t mean that they will call upon the policy to make a claim in every circumstance.\u201d</p> <p>It said the landlord might decide to accept a revised payment schedule, and that a tenant who has lost their job might be able to claim universal credit. But it confirmed that the landlord can only make a claim on the rent guarantee if the eviction notice \u201chas been correctly served on the tenant\u201d.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Land of poems and stories: the Cotswolds</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf ever I heard blessing it is there. Where birds in trees that shoals and shadows are.\u201d In April and May the Cotswold landscape still speaks in the soft, calm tones of Laurie Lee. For a first-time visitor it can take a while to tune into the hard, spare, wall-bound fields of the Cotswold plateau. Yet in the valleys and on the scarp edges, there are bluebells and wood anemones, clear spring-fed streams and a soundtrack of willow warblers and blackcaps, fresh back from their winter travels.</p> <p>The deep valleys around Stroud hold hanging woods, filled in April with the scent of wild garlic. At the National Trust-maintained <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/woodchester-park\" title=\"\">Woodchester Park</a>, where the half-completed Victorian manor stands mysterious in the valley bottom, it feels as though the clock has stopped and no one has yet arrived to restart it.</p> <p>Further north, in my home patch, the same timeless feel pervades <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hailes-abbey\" title=\"\">Hailes Abbey</a>, with, above it, a monument marking Thomas Cromwell\u2019s seat, from which it is said he watched the Abbey burn almost 500 years ago. From here you can walk a couple of miles along the Cotswold Way to Winchcombe.</p> <p>Spring is a wonderful time to explore smaller towns and villages, many of which are the subject of poems and stories. For me, each name conjures a memory: a village cricket match in April snow at <a href=\"https://www.cotswolds.info/places/guiting-power.shtml\" title=\"\">Guiting Power</a>; my childhood love of <a href=\"https://www.cotswolds.info/places/bibury.shtml\" title=\"\">Bibury</a>, with its row of ancient cottages, river, watermill and trout farm. The trout leaping for dancing mayflies in the spring.</p> <p>Today, an April treat is a long run or walk to listen to yellowhammers and skylarks along the Cotswolds\u2019 western edge, from Winchcombe to Broadway.

Just getting there is an adventure, as you are sometimes in a race against the incoming tide. For one of the great joys of being on Lindisfarne is that when the three-mile-long causeway closes (for around 10 hours a day) no one can get on or off.</p> <p>Tourists and pilgrims head to the medieval priory ruins or Lindisfarne Castle, but it\u2019s the island\u2019s expansive beauty, tranquillity and coastal walks that draw me here. When the tide starts coming in and the daytrippers scuttle back to the mainland, I stay on and pretend that I\u2019m a local.</p> <p>I first visited five years ago, on a cold winter\u2019s eve, but I resolved to return and have done three times since.</p> <p>In spring (May is best) the island is quieter than in crowded high summer, the wildflowers are beginning to burst into colour \u2013 look out for golden marsh-marigolds, lilac lady\u2019s smock and pale blue forget-me-nots. Seabirds reel about in the sky, and you\u2019ll hear the song of tiny meadow pipits and long-tailed pied wagtails.</p> <p>This is the time when I, too, like to shake off my hibernal self and walk, in glorious solitude, past the harbour and castle, up the east coast path to Emmanuel Head, and then turn west to the wild, windy three-mile strip of sand that is North Shore.</p> <p>If I set out before the causeway opens \u2013 the route via the castle up to the North Shore is along higher ground and not affected by the tides \u2013 I have this perfect walk to myself. Along the way, it\u2019s a joy to meander down into the coves and beaches.</p> <p>Coves Haven beach, which sits just past Sandham Bay, is my favourite place to pause for a sandwich or sip from my flask of tea.</p> <p>At this time of year, I\u2019m buoyed by the air that is less bite and more caress, the sun, surprisingly strong when it\u2019s out, the swaying of the marram grass, the ghostly cry of the seals and the eider ducks \u2013 which sound as though you\u2019ve just told them a filthy joke.</p> <p>Fair weather or not, Lindisfarne is very special, a place I go to dive into peace and listen deeply to nature, alive in the salty, sea air.<br><strong>Jini Reddy, whose new book, <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wanderland-9781472951939/\" title=\"\">Wanderland</a>, is out on 30 April (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99)</strong><br><br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018My whole being relaxes\u2019: Rathlin Island, Co Antrim</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbc2dd7f1df47423cdb3f525b9071e3c9c07da08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc2dd7f1df47423cdb3f525b9071e3c9c07da08/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Church bay, Rathlin Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church Bay, Rathlin Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Ricordi, Italy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My first visit to Rathlin Island was a birthday celebration. I had turned 14, it was early spring, and this wild initiation deeply affected the way I experienced the natural world. Watching the web of life resurge in spring on Rathlin is a rare and unique awakening. Catching the ferry from Ballycastle, you land on an island that is hardly changed by time. Our world is spinning, seemingly uncontrollably, but on arriving somewhere like Rathlin Island, the uncoiling is instant. The reconnection with nature and ourselves, the unburdening, is hard to avoid here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a38062a39c46ee1199d83daa4a33730101f20008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38062a39c46ee1199d83daa4a33730101f20008/1427_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"A fulmar off the cliffs of Rathlin Island.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fulmar off the cliffs of Rathlin Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The island, shaped like a sycamore seed, lies off the north-east coast of Northern Ireland. Its rugged cliffs are home to the largest sea bird colony in the north of the island of Ireland, and of course, this was why I first begged to go. I longed to see the spring abundance, the birds arriving from sea to breed. Thousands of beating wings. Heart-splitting symphonic sound. The <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/rathlin-island/\" title=\"\">West Light Seabird Observatory</a>, managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, is where you go to view the clamouring. Fulmars, guillemots, razorbills and gannets congregate in spring, and in early summer puffins join the colony. The cascading movement of birds and waves draws out all the cumbersome weight of the world.</p> <p>My whole being relaxes on Rathlin. The east of the island smells of salted dry wood, like an old ship hauled up on to horseshoe-shaped Church Bay. The community shop and little museum are crammed with wonderful island remnants. </p> <p>Looking out to sea from Church Bay, you might see the surface perforated by surging seals. From the surrounding meadows and farmland, you might hear the bubbling of lapwings, mewing buzzards, the nightly winnowing of a snipe. In Kebble nature reserve in the west of the island you can, in spring, spot the unusual<a href=\"https://wildflowerfinder.org.uk/Flowers/B/Bugle(Pyramidal)/Bugle(Pyramidal).htm\" title=\"\"> pyramidal bugle</a>, one of the rarest wildflowers in the British Isles. Then, out of the corner of your eye, you may see a sprite of light: a golden, blue-eyed Irish hare, the will-o-the-wisp of the island.

I\u2019m cautious around the beach edges. I\u2019ve seen adders here: spring, when they wake from hibernation, is the best time to see them (but it\u2019s rare so don\u2019t let that put you off). They\u2019re beautiful, and slide through wild crops of edible purslane like liquid silver falling down a plughole.</p> <p>We look for fossils, pick the first shoots of samphire, and take afternoon swims. It\u2019s about warm enough for the hardy from April \u2013 just. Mostly, if we\u2019re feeling lazy, we just sit, drink coffee and watch the Blackwater ebb and flood.</p> <p>Sometimes we walk. The best spring walk is southward, along the seawall to Burnham-on-Crouch. That 14 miles is the loneliest hike in England \u2013 you\u2019re unlikely to see a soul, just nesting terns, flowering white sea kale and mewing buzzards.<br><strong>Stephen Neale, </strong><strong>author of <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-england-coast-path-9781844865802/\" title=\"\">The England Coast Path</a></strong><strong> (Bloomsbury, \u00a318.99)</strong></p> <p><br></p> <h2><strong>Tides and treasure hunts: </strong><strong>Dee estuary, Merseyside</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23cfa6df5cdbea9c6c1362abc681033b0ce7e470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23cfa6df5cdbea9c6c1362abc681033b0ce7e470/0_71_4644_2786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thurstaston beach, with views across the River Dee to North Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thurstaston beach, with views across the River Dee to North Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Four times a year - in spring, summer, autumn and winter - I come with my family for a day of walking the banks of the Dee. Fifteen miles from my home town of Liverpool, the Dee is a river border between Wales and the Wirral peninsula, and the small towns and beaches on its banks give it the feel of a secret island.</p> <p>Spring has a particular magic. We\u2019ll walk along the sandstone prom in the village of Parkgate, buy an ice-cream from Nicholls and eat it on a bench watching the ever-changing estuary. This was once an embarkation point for Ireland but, by the mid-1800s, as the estuary silted up, Parkgate\u2019s maritime days were over. Today it\u2019s the salt marshes that make Parkgate a special place: it\u2019s a breeding ground for skylarks, redshanks and egrets, and a hunting ground for peregrines and marsh harriers. Time it right and you might witness a rare visit from the tide as it swallows up the marsh and overlaps the promenade wall. As the seawater flushes out water voles, shrews and harvest mice, in come the kestrels, merlins and sparrowhawks as marsh reverts to sea.</p> <p>Further along the coast is Thurstaston beach, a haunt of mine since childhood. A site of special scientific interest for its constantly eroding cliffs, Thurstaston is a strange landscape, a churning and collapsing place where my 14-year-old daughter and I hunt for precious stones: quartz and granite treasure glittering in the sunlight, occasionally a fossil, transported here from Scotland and the Lake District by ice-age glaciers. </p> <p>At West Kirby we walk at low tide across the sands to Hilbre Island, an archipelago cut off from the mainland for four hours out of every 12. Check the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast-and-sea/tide-tables/5/461#tide-details\" title=\"\">BBC tide tables</a> before setting out, and keep to the recommended route across the sand. Good boots or wellies are essential.</p> <p>It takes an hour to reach Hilbre via smaller isles Little Eye and Middle Eye \u2013 and it\u2019s vital to start your return three hours before high tide. In April, I have seen sandwich terns, Manx shearwaters and dunlins here. Sometimes there are fulmars and Arctic skuas. The old lifeboat station ruins are a good place<strong> </strong>for watching grey seals.</p> <p>Above all, from anywhere along the Dee, watch and wait for sunset\u2019s spectacular displays of changing light. <br><strong>Jeff Young, whose </strong><strong>latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ghost-town-9781908213785.html\" title=\"\">Ghost Town, A Liverpool Shadowplay</a>, is out now (Little Toller, \u00a316)</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018Spring is not gentle here\u2019: Treshnish Isles, Hebrides</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799e53701e27909125454a2fcb87f390243cb5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799e53701e27909125454a2fcb87f390243cb5e7/0_0_5367_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puffins on Lunga, one of the Treshnish Isles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puffins on Lunga, one of the Treshnish Isles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up in tropical Papua New Guinea, where there were only two seasons: the dry season and the monsoon. When I arrived in Scotland as a teenager I was mesmerised by its four seasons, especially spring, which navigates that precarious space between darkness and light \u2013 a faerie child creeping out from beneath the dark skirts of winter.</p> <p>Spring has drawn me again and again to Lunga, one of the small islands and skerries that make up the Treshnish Isles, west of Mull and part of the Inner Hebrides. A site of special scientific interest, it is home to huge colonies of puffins (best seen from mid-April), razorbills, fulmars and shags, and is an important breeding area for grey seals.</p> <p>Spring is not gentle here; new life is profuse but so is danger. The hares come out boxing, thousands of guillemots cling to sheer rock and cry a deafening \u201carrr, arrr\u201d, and the puffins, which have come in off the Atlantic to lay their eggs in rabbit burrows, welcome humans, whose presence keeps away the skuas and gulls.</p> <p>The weather is mercurial. Even landing is precarious. There is no beach \u2013 the boat sidles up to a profusion of boulders washed smooth by the Atlantic, and you jump across the divide, but the smell of gorse, camomile and salt as you climb the steep path to the plateau clears away the dregs of winter. From here you might spot minke whales, porpoises, basking sharks and sea eagles, and when the boat returns two hours later, it will seem too soon.</p> <p>I base myself on Mull, in Tobermory, with its seafront cottages in spring-like shades of primrose, rose campion and bluebell. From here, boat trips by <a href=\"http://www.staffatours.com/\" title=\"\">Staffa Tours</a> (check if still running: 07831 885985) run to both Lunga and nearby Staffa. On my first visit 15 years ago, a thick veil of mist covered the sea as we headed out towards Lunga, and when it finally lifted we found a great basking shark travelling alongside us.<br><strong>Kirstin Zhang, winner of Stanford\u2019s New Travel Writer of the Year 2020 award</strong></p> <p><br></p> <h2><strong>Strictly for the birds: Avalon Marshes, Somerset</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e018f0413279934c7209f5bec0f85fc5fcd1e2db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e018f0413279934c7209f5bec0f85fc5fcd1e2db/0_275_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reeded pools and lakes at Avalon Marshes, with Glastonbury Tor in distance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reeded pools and lakes at Avalon Marshes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dennis/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a spring weekend seeking out some of Britain\u2019s rarest breeding birds, Somerset\u2019s <a href=\"http://avalonmarshes.org/\" title=\"\">Avalon Marshes</a> are pretty hard to beat. Over the past 30 years, these former peat diggings have been transformed from unsightly holes in the ground into one of Britain\u2019s top birding spots. It\u2019s a linked series of nature reserves, and each has a mixture of open water and reedbeds. They are all crossed by a disused railway line giving easy access to viewpoints and hides. And for a break from the wildlife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/22/glastonbury-town-festival-druids-pagans-travel-holidays\" title=\"\">Glastonbury</a>, Wells, <a href=\"https://www.cheddargorge.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cheddar Gorge</a> and the charming village of <a href=\"http://www.theisleofwedmore.net/visiting-wedmore/\" title=\"\">Wedmore</a> are all within easy reach.</p> <p>When I moved here with my young family just over a decade ago, many of the birds I now see regularly were either absent or very rare. Since then, climate change and habitat creation have allowed several species from continental Europe to colonise these marshes. They include little, great white and now cattle egrets \u2013 the birds we usually only see perched on the backs of big African mammals in wildlife documentaries.</p> <p>Great white egrets \u2013 the tallest member of their family \u2013 are easy to spot at the RSPB\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/ham-wall/?channel=paidsearch&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwu6fzBRC6ARIsAJUwa2StZUhDXFXPUUbKhTLN1OmJUxw2VLWItYwpes9p3-0qSTHHW7bUw0IaAjJzEALw_wcB\" title=\"\"> Ham Wall</a> reserve, in the shadow of Glastonbury Tor, and at the nearby Somerset Wildlife Trust\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.somersetwildlife.org/nature-reserves/catcott-complex\" title=\"\">Catcott Lows</a>, also a regular site for cattle egrets.</p> <p>At this time of year, I always try to get out before breakfast to catch the end of the dawn chorus. This is also the best time to hear one of our most elusive birds, the bittern, whose loud, booming call sounds like someone blowing across the top of a milk bottle. I don\u2019t see bitterns very often, but on fine spring days they sometimes fly up from their reedbed hideaways \u2013 looking, as one young visitor suggested, like a \u201ctoasted heron\u201d.</p> <p>Birds of prey include buzzards, sparrowhawks and marsh harriers, which float low over the reeds, occasionally rising high into the sky to display. From late April, hobbies chase flying insects, while the reedbeds and adjacent vegetation are home to chiffchaffs, blackcaps, whitethroats, and several warbler species.</p> <p>Other migrant visitors such as swallows, sand martins and swifts catch flying insects over the open water, and one of my favourite birds \u2013 the great crested grebe \u2013 performs its famous courtship display, the male and female rising up in the water to wave weed at one another in a bizarre gesture of affection.</p> <p>On sunny spring days, hairy dragonflies and orange-tip butterflies are on the wing, and there is always a slim chance that you might stumble across an otter. And wherever I go, I look out for that unmistakable flash of blue as a kingfisher whizzes by.</p> <p> For me, on a fine spring day there\u2019s simply no better place to be than on the marshes. <br><strong>Stephen Moss, whose latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-accidental-countryside-9781783351640.html\" title=\"\">The Accidental Countryside</a>, is out now (Guardian Faber, \u00a316.99).

And spring is absolutely the best time to go \u2013 be it early in the season, when the verges are sprung with primroses and crocuses, and the cries of new lambs fill the air, or a little later, when the hawthorns turn the hedgerows white and the woods are overflowing with bluebells.</p> <p>My first encounter with this beautiful vale was a stay on a campsite near the quaint village of Maentwrog, as part of a trip to interview land artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/02/david-nash-exhibition-opens-at-national-museum-cardiff\" title=\"\">David Nash</a>, who is based up in Blaenau Ffestiniog \u2013 Mordor to Maentwrog\u2019s Shire.</p> <p>For several mornings, as I walked up to see David in his chapel workshop, the day dawning choral all about me, golden sun made the fresh-sprung grass and bronze-purple stones of the field walls shine. It was here, in 1978, that David set his wonderful work of land art, Wooden Boulder, in motion. </p> <p>The huge rough-hewn sphere of heartwood fell into a stream when he was trying to move it to the chapel and slowly \u2013 buoyed, bounced and buffeted by hectic stream spate and lazy summer drift \u2013 meandered its way to the saltmarsh maze of the Dwyryd\u2019s estuary.</p> <p>Another springtime, drawn by memories of train songs and half-glimpsed smoke, I set off north up the valley, zigzagged my way up steepening slopes in clouds of pollen and heather fug, and emerged on a fir-tree\u2019d ridge.</p> <p>I found a path that led to a small sturdy cottage, in front of which curved a set of narrow-gauge railway tracks. There, I found a tiny platform. A painted sign read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/07/ffestiniog-railway-cottage-snowdonia-wales\" title=\"\">Coed y Bleiddiau</a> (Wood of the Wolves). Hearing a distant huff and chuff, I saw a red locomotive approaching. I held out an arm and was overjoyed to see the train slow. It drew up before me, a steaming crimson and copper wonder.</p> <p>I climbed aboard and the train began to trundle down to Porthmadog \u2013 ghosting above the Dwyryd river through ancient woodland and cuttings spangled with late snowdrops and daffodils. Over stone embankments, viaducts and bridges, past gardens strung with immaculate washing, through level crossings manned by fellows who wave, it slowly descended towards the bright estuary flats, Wooden Boulder and the Irish Sea.

Some days you will be lucky, greeted by bright skies that make it impossible not to run headfirst into the waves. On others, the rain will so blur the landscape that it is hard to hold on to any discrete shape of the coast beneath it. This changeability is a large part of why I love England\u2019s southernmost county at this time of year.</p> <p>Lelant, the village where my mother and grandmother grew up, is on the quiet north coast of West Penwith, the region of Cornwall towards Land\u2019s End. Lelant\u2019s beach, Porthkidney Sands, occupies the same yawning bay as St Ives. Unlike St Ives, though, it has no car parks, cafes, or rows of toilets lined up before the sea like so many nervous swimmers. Instead you are met with an endless empty beach, where sandpipers hop in and out of the foam left by departing waves.</p> <p>Virginia Woolf called it \u201cvast &amp; melancholy\u201d, but since I was a child, it has been on this beach that I have felt most free. We\u2019ll often stride out west along the coastal path from Lelant to Zennor, stopping briefly in St Ives to visit the bronze abstract figures in Barbara Hepworth\u2019s sculpture garden, prettily framed by blossoming trees. Zennor is a village set atop a wild stretch of granite cliffs, which erupts with lavender-coloured spikes of squill and pink tufts of thrift in spring.</p> <p>Zennor\u2019s church, St Senara, is home to the \u201cMermaid Chair\u201d, a 600-year-old pew with a mermaid combing her hair carved into its side.

My own quest to understand why so many of us embark on pilgrimages began here, one April, as I set Sebald\u2019s book down and turned my gaze out to sea.</p> <p>With big skies and salty air, and hedgerows bursting with blossom and birdsong, spring here offers a tonic for mind and body; it feels like you can step out of time into a simpler world. I love to amble along the footpath by the River Blyth \u2013 starting from Walberswick. With marsh harriers circling overhead, waders calling and the song of larks ascending, your heart lifts.</p> <p>In the opposite direction is a circular trail along wooden causeways through marshes where, by May, reed warblers will be busy building nests and cuckoos calling to their mates as they have done since time immemorial. For a fee of \u00a31, the Walberswick ferry, a traditional rowing boat, will take you across the river to Southwold, and back to the 21st century.</p> <p>Another favourite in spring, a little further up the coast, is the walk from Pakefield into Lowestoft, whose promenade and beach offer plenty of space.

  "<p>As the Schengen area closed its external borders last week, in a move designed to replace the closing of member states\u2019 national borders against imported Covid-19 infection, some internal barriers still went up in Europe. The day after the European commission\u2019s announcement, the Greek government introduced a set of measures that would apply to the migrant camps in the Greek islands.</p> \n<p>As of Wednesday, the camps have been locked down from 7pm to 7am. In the daytime, only one person is allowed out per family, and the police control their movements. Some camps, on the islands of Leros and Kos, have been closed entirely.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, visits to the camps\u2019 reception centres have been temporarily suspended, except for those who work there, and arrivals are being subjected to compulsory fever screening. The measures only apply to the camps, not to the resident population of the islands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the five Greek island \u201chotspots\u201d that are sheltering about 42,000 people, one case of Covid-19 has been recorded. The affected person is a resident of the island of Lesbos. There have been no cases in the camps so far.</p> \n<p>In Greece as a whole, 464 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded and six deaths. The government has banned mass gatherings and is urging Greeks to practise social distancing. Thirteen hospitals on the mainland have been turned over to the treatment of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe imposition of this restriction of movement on the people of the camps and not for anyone else on the islands is unacceptable and discriminatory,\u201d said Apostolos Veizis, director of the medical operational support unit for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Greece. \u201cYou are locking children, women and men into severely overcrowded camps where the sanitation and hygiene conditions are horrific.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The largest camp, Moria on Lesbos, is temporary home to about 20,000 people but was built for just over 6,000. In parts of Moria, there is one water tap for 1,300 people, one toilet for 167 people and one shower for 242 people.</p> \n<p>Up to six people may be sleeping in 3 sq metres (32 sq feet), a quarter of the size of an average parking space. \u201cThey do not have enough water or soap to regularly wash their hands and they do not have the luxury of being able to self-isolate,\u201d Veizis said.</p> \n<p>Over a third of the migrants are children, just under a half of whom are unaccompanied. Their principal countries of origin are Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Palestine and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and their average stay in the camp is between five months and a year.</p> \n<p>There are already high levels of health problems among the migrants, due to the unsanitary conditions, and high levels of stress. Veizis calls the situation \u201ca chronic emergency\u201d. \u201cIf we had an outbreak in these camps, it would be disastrous,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Greek National Public Health Organisation, which is responsible for health in the camps, did not respond to requests for comment. However, a European commission spokesperson, Ciara Bottomley, wrote in an email that the commission was funding the deployment of doctors and other medical staff to the hotspots. \u201cThe healthcare response in case of an incident on a hotspot island foresees first treatment at the local island hospital followed by air evacuation to one of the specialised hospitals in the mainland,\u201d she went on.</p> \n<p>Those measures appear to apply to local residents only. Since last July, all arrivals to the camps have been excluded from the Greek healthcare system. Three government-funded doctors are conducting vulnerability screening in Moria, but the only medical care is being provided there by NGOs and voluntary groups.</p> \n<p>Veizis said MSF had been in contact with the government to discuss case management in the camps as part of the government\u2019s evolving Covid-19 strategy, in case of an outbreak there.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, he fears the new regime will add to the migrants\u2019 stress while fanning tensions between them and local residents. Violence directed at NGOs forced some of them to temporarily suspend operations this month.</p> \n<p>The new measures, Veizis says, are just \u201cone more element to pit the people of the islands against the asylum seekers\u201d.</p>",

require senators and their staffers to work through the entire weekend to have the bill ready by Monday.</p> \n  <p>McConnell said the $1 trillion package Senate <strong>Republicans </strong>released yesterday -- which outlines direct payments to American families and $200 billion to airlines and other distressed industries, among other things -- would be the starting point for negotiations.</p> \n  <p>However, Senate <strong>Democrats </strong>have already signaled they want many changes made to the bill, so a lot of negotiating will need to take place between now and Monday to set up a

Many of those restaurant workers are also aspiring actors, but auditions and shoots are off the agenda as the TV and film industry screeched to a stop.</p> <p>One of LA\u2019s most prominent chefs, Nancy Silverton, announced that she was turning one of her restaurants on Melrose Avenue into a relief center for laid-off restaurant workers that would provide 300 high-quality meals every night for the next two weeks, paid for by the whiskey company Maker\u2019s Mark, along with a variety of household essentials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41a792cbf4f910234f892d235e0d6bf8fbcd2e00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a792cbf4f910234f892d235e0d6bf8fbcd2e00/0_50_3325_1995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wearing a mask for protection against the coronavirus, Henry Powell heads to his car after shopping at a Safeway store in Sacramento\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wearing a mask for protection against the coronavirus, Henry Powell heads to his car after shopping at a Safeway store in Sacramento.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up north in Sacramento, the first day of shelter-in-place felt like a weekend-come-early.</p> <p>The clangs of the passing trolleys and beeps of the pedestrian walk signals echoed in the downtown area\u2019s near-empty streets.</p> <p>The typical steady flow of pedestrians had slowed to a trickle, with few still pacing the sidewalks with dogs and grocery bags. Parking, a precious commodity in California, was plentiful, with lines of meters blinking blankly next to swaths of spaces. The Capitol Mall, usually buzzing with activity on a weekday, sat quiet and peaceful under blue skies, few cars and even fewer people passing by the state house.</p> <p>Downtown Sacramento businesses generally heeded the governor\u2019s advisories early on, with bars and brewpubs closing down earlier in the week. On Friday, some restaurants with their chairs stacked on top of their tables were open for take-out and delivery only. Some bars were completely dark, with gates pulled down and shuttered.</p> <p>\u201cDowntown is kind of a ghost town,\u201d said Shane Nicolette, 27, a barista at Temple Coffee Roasters. \u201cOver the last week, it\u2019s been a progression of state workers and people who work downtown, figuring out how they can work from home. Now it\u2019s kind of integrated into everything over here.\u201d</p> <p>On a typical weekday, Nicolette would serve up to 500 people. On Friday, he served 50.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to cut hours back, way back. And when you work for tips, it\u2019s a huge impact going from a line out the door to one person every 10 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Other businesses downtown have already started letting their workers go. The manager on duty at Rodney\u2019s Cigar and Liquor Store, who asked to be identified only as Bob, said he learned right after the governor issued his shelter-in-place order that he lost his other job working as a parking attendant at the downtown Marriott and Hyatt hotels. \u201cIt\u2019s been rough, really rough,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to find some place else, some place unaffected. We\u2019re all looking for some place unaffected.\u201d</p> <p>The lack of business as usual downtown made the presence of Sacramento\u2019s homeless population stand out in sharp contrast. None of the unhoused individuals approached by a reporter said they had heard from the city, county or state about coronavirus, or about washing their hands, nor had they received any hand sanitizer.</p> <p>\u201cI just know what I\u2019ve been hearing from the past week out on the street from other people,\u201d said Thomas Mitchell, 44. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the coronavirus was here until it was already here.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell has already suffered a stroke and a seizure while out on the streets, as well as the stomach flu. He\u2019s not worried about getting coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out here eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve already been sick. So be it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afb8651fa0828c13052eb8b6fd025d8f8e72b29a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afb8651fa0828c13052eb8b6fd025d8f8e72b29a/0_0_4894_2937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Lake in Oakland theater displays a message about Donald Trump and the Coronavirus on their marquee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Lake in Oakland theater displays a message about Donald Trump and the Coronavirus on their marquee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while the rest of the state comes to terms with the new restrictions, life seemed to be slowly taking on a new, if altered, sense of normalcy in the Bay Area, where a shelter-in-place order took effect on Tuesday.</p> <p>Midmorning, two medical students at the University of California San Francisco stationed themselves at a typically busy corner of the city\u2019s Mission District, soliciting N95 masks. They made sure to stand six feet apart, a distance enforced by a tape measurer they\u2019d extended.</p> <p>Behind them, dog-walkers and parents with children enjoying a warm spring morning dotted the usually crowded Dolores park.</p> <p>Even as workers nailed plywood over windows of nearby shops, the video-rental section of Fayes coffee did brisk business.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re telling people if you want to leave your house once this week and rent 15 movies, we\u2019re not going to be charging late fees,\u201d said the store owner Justin Lawrence.</p> <p>Life had re-emerged, too, on the trails and sidewalks lining Oakland\u2019s iconic Lake Merritt.</p> <p>Sidewalks filled only with radio silence on Monday night had been reanimated by Friday morning, as bikers and joggers awkwardly navigated a 10-ft sidewalk while trying to observe social distancing norms.</p> <p>Nearby, Amber Fina, 30, was organizing clothes in the tent where she sleeps. She said she\u2019s lived through similar restrictions amid a hurricane in her native Florida, but the lockdown in Oakland was posing unexpected challenges.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s making it impossible to get money. Not that many people are out, and if they are nobody wants to get close to you to hand you money. I need to eat,\u201d Fina said.</p> <p>Fina held up a bag of purified water and a bottle of sanitizer, which she said two healthcare workers delivered when they came through the encampment this week to take her and her neighbors\u2019 temperature. Police have been kind, she said, coming around to ask if she needed services. They haven\u2019t chased anybody off the encampment, she said, not even when the guys three tents down set a fire near their tent earlier this week.</p> <p>Two construction workers near a playground smoked as they took a break from a project underway. One of the workers, Greg Stevens, said he was happy for the work.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about everyone losing their minds and panic-buying everything,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cDid you see the crowds at gun stores? I\u2019m an avid shooter, but c\u2019mon. To me, that\u2019s the dangerous part. People losing all reason.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2742cd35cef8069d8f96bbc7ad0d0ab8f9a9a44e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2742cd35cef8069d8f96bbc7ad0d0ab8f9a9a44e/0_118_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families arrive at West Oakland middle school to pick up grab and go meals during the Oakland unified school district shutdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families arrive at West Oakland middle school to pick up grab and go meals during the Oakland unified school district shutdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Munsch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kendall Shotwell looked on as her two-year-old son Rider, wearing a hat that said Little Dreamer, ran in circles in a nearby playground and hopped on the scooter he\u2019d commandeered from another child.</p> <p>Shotwell\u2019s husband is also in construction and works as an electrician, but he\u2019s been off work.
