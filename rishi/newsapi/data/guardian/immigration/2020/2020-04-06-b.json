It will decide whether or not we will rise again after Easter,\u201d Kurz said, referring to the resurrection of Jesus, the culmination of the Easter feast, which is widely celebrated in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.</p> \n  <p>From 1 May, all shops, shopping centres and hairdressers will be allowed to open.

They should be used by the whole of the country. Those who don\u2019t have a mobile phone will be required to wear a special key-ring style device, the chancellor said at the weekend.

It is being developed in conjunction with a European app that 130 researchers are developing, and will warn people if they might have had contact with infected persons. Its use is expected to be anonymous and voluntary, although surveys show a large number of Germans are prepared to use it if it leads to a relaxation of lockdown rules. The ultimate aim should be to have a single, Europe-wide tracking app. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIts use should be voluntary, but obviously with the hope that as many people as possible will use it,\u201d Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the German government said this afternoon. \u201cPeople who use it will be doing their significant bit to reduce the spread of the infection and helping measures to fight it.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:52:18.409Z\">at 2.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b1a298f08c35a1d11ad59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:08:27.447Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Eugen Tomac, a Romanian MEP, has tabled a written question in the European parliament asking what measures the European commission intends to take to forestall the spread of Covid-19 among refugees in the Greek islands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>Fears are growing that the conditions in which refugees are living on Europe\u2019s borders are ripe for the spread of pandemic disease.

As the EU\u2019s fight to contain the virus continues, nearly 42 000 asylum seekers are living in squalid conditions in hotspots on the Greek islands. This is likely to lead to an outbreak. Hence, can the Commission answer the following questions:</p> \n   <p>1. How does it intend to ensure the right to health in the refugee camps is respected?</p> \n   <p>2. What measures have been taken to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak within the overcrowded camps?</p> \n   <p>3.

But because they are so sensitive they pick up other sources too, including human activity, so road traffic, people walking past and nearby factories,\u201d said Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS in Edinburgh. \u201cAll these things generate vibrations and those propagate through the Earth.\u201d</p> \n<p>Human-induced vibrations, known in the trade as \u201ccultural noise\u201d, spread through the planet differently to tremors from earthquakes and tend to die away a few miles from their origins. But seismometers placed near urban centres still pick up plenty of noise that makes it harder for scientists to analyse the more valuable seismic data.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s network of sensitive instruments picked up markedly fewer vibrations last week as the coronavirus lockdown took hold, the researchers found. \u201cWe had a look at the data from some of our seismic stations around the UK and we do see an effect,\u201d said Baptie. At some sensors, cultural noise is running at five decibels lower than normal, about a quarter down on usual readings. Similar falls have been spotted by Belgian seismologists based in Brussels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69e1f072-d353-4bcb-a8d6-6cc8e2ebf165\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z8YfSMf7S6s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The BGS operates a national network of about 80 seismometers from Shetland to Jersey that provide a constant ear to the ground. The data are pored over by BGS scientists and fed into a global network that is used to monitor earthquakes anywhere on the planet. In contrast to low-frequency tremors, cultural noise vibrations are high-frequency waves, around one to 100Hz, that tend to travel through the surface layers of the Earth.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world,\u201d said Baptie. If so, it would shed light on the frequency of different magnitude earthquakes and, in the case of more distant tremors, how the seismic waves are affected by the Earth\u2019s structure and the characteristics of the shifting faults that unleash them.</p> \n<p>Researchers at the BGS now hope to check all their seismometers for the fall in human noise with the aim of producing a map that will reveal which areas of Britain have seen the most stark declines in the human hum. The hunt for smaller earthquakes may take longer than the lockdown holds, however. \u201cWe aren\u2019t in a particularly active region,\u201d said Baptie. \u201cSo we may not get anything in the short term.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The confusion that the authorities have spread about social distancing is coming home to roost in the form of \u201cCovidgilantes\u201d, who are now infesting social media sites with their condemnations of those trying to go to work, go shopping or take some exercise.

  "<h2>SEAN\u2019S WORLD</h2> <p>Considering the Fiver\u2019s pre-conceived notion that Sean Dyche would be spending the current lockdown spreadeagled on a chaise longue in his red silk kimono drinking endless martinis while watching reruns of The Sweeney on ITV4, we were pleased to see he\u2019s putting his spare time to more productive use. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/05/city-to-investigate-kyle-walker-over-sex-party-that-broke-quarantine-rules\">Kyle Walker featured</a> in one of the Sunday papers and was forced to issue \u201ca public apology for the choices I made last week\u201d, the Burnley manager was in another making no apologies whatsoever for using his enforced down time to reacquaint himself with his family, free up extra room in his wine cellar by working his way through the contents and perform assorted outdoor chores that seem to involve power-hosing anything in view.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018I\u2019m doing things I don\u2019t get the chance to normally do,\u201d he said. \u201cTidying up the garage, jet washing. Needless to say I\u2019m jet washing just about everything I can find. If it stays somewhere for too long it gets jet washed! There are things I miss of course like having a curry or a pint down at the pub. I\u2019ve done a lot of home cooking. We also go out on our bikes, out for walks as a family, maintaining our fitness and keeping stimulated.\u201d</p> <p>Dyche has also been keeping stimulated by brushing up on his IT skills, having got his son, Max, to teach him how to use Zoom so he can have virtual meetings with his coaching staff in an effort to ensure Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes remain as svelte as possible ahead of ... whatever happens next. \u201cThere are non-stop support lines for players and staff. Dietary advice, psychological support if needed. We\u2019re trying to keep as many bases covered as we can.\u201d</p> <p>This morning, Dyche put down his power hose for long enough to shoot the breeze with Talksport, adding his two cents to the national debate over how much money Premier League players should be paid and how they should spend it. Over the weekend, health secretary Matt Hancock doubled down on his demand that top-flight footballers do more to help those less fortunate but like many others, Dyche suggested the MP should keep his neb out of affairs that are none of his concern.</p> <p>\u201cI can only presume he was immediately ill informed,\u201d said Dyche of the Tory hypocrite. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about other businesses, I can only speak about the football industry because I have been in it all of my life. I have seen footballers do so many good things, so many things financially, so many things with time, care effort and attention. It is such a massive generalisation for Mr Hancock to throw that in. I can only hope he was ill informed and over the weekend a bit of balance has been brought in.\u201d The Fiver would like to commend the Burnley manager\u2019s breezy optimism at this very difficult time.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cThe UAE Football Association has terminated the contract of Ivan Jovanovic and his team of assistants, thanking him for his efforts and wishing him success\u201d \u2013 the UAE FA wave goodbye to their Serbian coach of five months despite an enviable unbeaten record of P0 W0 D0 L0 F0 A0.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f51491774c3868aa62c641aeadb7cae062c47746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f51491774c3868aa62c641aeadb7cae062c47746/0_133_1671_1002/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Ivan Jovanovic: being told to Do One despite playing none\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivan Jovanovic: being told to Do One despite playing none.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakis Savvides/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cMy least favourite game (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters)? Took my then-eight-year-old son down to St Andrew\u2019s, and bought him his first shirt with his name and No 8 proudly on the back (his age and Trevor Francis\u2019 shirt number). The opponents? Bournemouth, who won 8-0. He is scarred for life but still we go\u201d \u2013 Chris Sampson.</p> <p>\u201cImagine the excitement of the new season for Norwich City (and fans) in August 2009, having just dropped down to League One. A relatively new manager in Bryan Gunn, a fantastic new recruit in flamin\u2019 Aussie keeper Michael Theoklitos and a home game against Colchester. Five-nil down at half-time and the end result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/08/norwich-capitulate-to-colchester\">a 7-1 loss</a> led to fan angst and some some quick personnel changes. Keeper on the bench and Gunn replaced by Colchester manager Paul Lambert, who went on to take the Yellows up and up again. Of course Lambert went on to much greater things in a stellar managerial career. What? Oh\u201d \u2013 Terry Banfield.</p> <p>\u201cI travelled to the 2008 Big Cup final as a Chelsea fan. On arrival, my dad, brother and I entered the outdoor fanzone only to realise we hadn\u2019t changed up any roubles but were told if we left we would not be allowed back in. It was 8am. So we went around 18 hours in the rain without shelter, food or water, taking in 120 minutes plus a shootout to reach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/30/manchester-united-chelsea-champions-league-moscow\">the worst outcome possible</a>, via being the width of a post from the best result in our history. We were then locked in a sweltering minibus before encountering a \u2018first come, first served\u2019 policy at the airport and eventually arrived back at Gatwick sometime the next day. The kicker: I was living in Germany at the time and could only get a visa from the club, so my journey read: Berlin-London-Moscow-London-Berlin, for the cost of a cool grand\u201d \u2013 Stuart Robinson.</p> <p>\u201cMy local team is the Colorado Rapids of MLS.

  "<p>The boss of JP Morgan, Wall Street\u2019s biggest bank, has said the world faces a \u201cbad recession\u201d as he took a swipe at America\u2019s lack of preparedness for the pandemic.</p> <p>In his annual address, written a month after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/jp-morgan-chief-jamie-dimon-has-emergency-heart-surgery\">underwent emergency heart surgery</a>, Jamie Dimon said that at the very least a severe downturn was on its way coupled with financial pressures reminiscent of the banking crash more than a decade ago.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what the future will hold \u2013 but at a minimum, we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008.\u201d</p> <p>He said JP Morgan had not asked for any government support and would continue lending money, while offering greater forbearance for customers struggling to repay debts. But he admitted that even Wall Street\u2019s largest bank \u201ccannot be immune\u201d to the economic turmoil and could be forced to suspend the dividend it pays to shareholders.</p> <p>The banker has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/13/trump-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-ceo\">previously clashed with Donald Trump</a> after claiming that he could beat the president in an election. And Dimon appeared to criticise the Trump administration\u2019s lack of readiness for the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThere should have been a pandemic playbook,\u201d said Dimon.</p> <p>But he also pointed to much deeper, structural problems in US society that he said were contributing to the danger presented by coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, America has always had its flaws,\u201d said Dimon. \u201cThe current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country.\u201d</p> <p>Dimon, whose cash-plus-stock pay package was worth $31.5m (\u00a325.6m) last year, highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/26/jamie-dimon-crocodile-tears-inequality\">worsening wealth inequality</a> as one of America\u2019s biggest problems, citing the fact that the share of wages for the bottom 30% of US citizens has been declining.</p> <p>The JP Morgan boss also lamented poor outcomes in education, a costly healthcare system that many people cannot access, the lack of a social safety net and a poor immigration policy.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to acknowledge these problems and the damage they have done if we are ever going to fix them,\u201d said Dimon, who returned to work this year after heart surgery.</p> <p>\u201cAs we have seen in past crises of this magnitude, there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we \u2013 at all levels of society, government, business, healthcare systems, and civic and humanitarian organisations \u2013 could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale.\u201d</p> <p>JP Morgan reported profits of $36.4bn last year and Dimon said the bank could survive and keep lending, even if its most pessimistic scenarios for the effect of the pandemic on the global economy came to pass.</p> <p>But its dividend could be suspended in the \u201cextremely adverse scenario\u201d in which the US economy shrinks by 35% in the second quarter and unemployment hits 14% by the end of the year.</p>",
  "<p>Europe\u2019s governments have begun to look ahead to the post-lockdown phase of their battle against Covid-19 as curves on the continent flatten, while the US braces for \u201cpeak death week\u201d and Japan prepares to declare a state of national emergency.</p> \n<p>Austria on Monday became the first EU country to publicly announce plans to lift its restrictions. \u201cThe aim is that from April 14 ... smaller shops up to 400 square metres, as well as hardware and garden stores, can open again, under strict security conditions,\u201d the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said.</p> \n<p>If the government\u2019s timetable goes to plan, larger shops could reopen on 1 May and hotels, restaurants and other services from mid-May, Kurz said, adding that \u201ceverything will depend\u201d on whether citizens continue to obey draconian distancing rules this week and over the Easter break.</p> \n<p>Denmark also announced plans to start reopening nurseries and primary schools from 15 April if the number of Covid-19 deaths and new cases remain stable.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will probably be a bit like walking the rope. If we stand still along the way we could fall and if we go too fast it can go wrong.

He is one of those rare artists who transcends the art world, having become widely known as one of America\u2019s most famous artists, if not one of America\u2019s most famous Americans. Over time, Warhol became \u2013&nbsp;and still is \u2013 a big brand, which is just how he wanted it.\u201d</p> <p>Their aim with the show was to strip away some of the myths about Warhol\u2019s work. \u201cWhen many think of him, they still turn to pop art and images of soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles, Marilyn\u2019s and Jackie\u2019s. Yet most of these works were produced in the early part of the 1960s at the artist\u2019s first home on Lexington Avenue, not the Silver Factory, as people imagine. The reality being that Warhol\u2019s enduring influence can be found in his long-running investment in experimental film and TV, as well as his ongoing fascination with celebrity, business art, pop music and commercial publications.\u201d</p> <p>Warhol was known for shrouding his real identity behind hype and eccentricity. Muir and Moran used this as an opportunity to examine the person beneath all of that. \u201cWe wanted to look at Warhol for who he was, taking into account his family\u2019s journey to America from eastern Europe, his queer identity, and the way in which his work would ultimately be informed by death and religion,\u201d they say. \u201cWith this in mind, we wanted to look at Warhol afresh.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>House sales in the UK will collapse this year as the coronavirus pandemic puts the property market into deep freeze. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">prices</a> will fall by only 3% and will rebound next year, according to global consultancy Knight Frank.</p> <p>In the first reassessment of the property market by one of the major forecasters, Knight Frank said the number of house sales in the UK would plummet from 1,175,000 last year to just 734,000 this year.</p> <p>Many of the \u201clost\u201d sales will not be carried forward to next year, spelling disaster for estate agents and other firms in the property chain \u2013 from valuers to removals companies \u2013 that rely on transactions for their business.</p> <p>But the consultancy is not predicting a collapse in house prices, which were starting to revive in the early part of 2020 before coronavirus took hold.</p> <p>It forecast that mainstream UK house prices would fall 3% in 2020, but then bounce back by 5% in 2021. Behind the Knight Frank forecasts is an assumption that the British economy will shrink by 4% in 2020 before growing by 4.5% next year as the pandemic recedes.</p> <p>Liam Bailey, the global head of research at Knight Frank, said: \u201cThe housing market was in a strong position in January and February. A sharp uptick in sales and price growth was seen across the UK, with even the prime central London market seeing a reversal of a five-year-long price decline.</p> <p>\u201cWe [now] have to expect weaker economic activity in the first half of 2020, the dislocation in the jobs market and weakened consumer sentiment will impact on prices \u2013 however, the relatively finite timespan of the crisis means declines will be limited.\u201d</p> <p>The agency only forecasts rents for prime central London, and it expected them to be flat in 2020, then rising 3% next year.</p> <p>Nationwide building society issued its monthly house price index at the end of last week, showing a more than \u00a33,000 surge in the average price of a home in Britain in March, the fastest pace for two years. But it stressed the figures did not take into account the lockdown in the market since then, and that \u201chousing market activity is now grinding to a halt\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Estate agents say their businesses have all but collapsed. Lucy Pendleton of agents James Pendleton said: \u201cEven before an outright housing market freeze was declared, we had been forced to furlough more than half of our staff. Last week the number of sales being agreed was down 84.2% annually, exchanges were down 66.6%, the volume of offers had fallen 70% and viewings had ceased altogether.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that commentators talked of Brexit uncertainty putting transactions on ice, but that feels like ancient history now. Covid-19 has brought brutal new meaning to a frozen market.</p> <p>Pendleton is pinning its hopes on a vigorous bounceback next year: \u201cThe housing market will come roaring back to life as soon as the lockdown ends, aided by interest rates that are significantly lower than when it began.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After seven months of waiting, Ahmed* had everything ready for his younger brother. Finally, 18-year-old Wahid was due to arrive from the Greek island of Samos under family reunion laws.</p> <p>But on 19 March, as Covid-19 took hold across Europe, the Greek authorities called to tell him the transfer had been cancelled because of the growing restrictions on flights. Greece had suspended direct flights to the UK but indirect routes are still available.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency told the Guardian that most European countries have suspended transfers. According to charity Safe Passage, Greek authorities have stopped 52 family reunion transfers to the UK alone. The charity say they are concerned that the numbers of cancelled reunions could stretch into the hundreds.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so disappointing,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWe had everything planned, I had rented a room for him here, he was so excited to finally be joining me.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office has said it is the responsibility of the sending country to organise the transfer. In a statement, the Home Office said: \u201cThe Home Office is continuing to process Dublin cases, including children, as far as the current restrictions in place across Europe permit.<strong> </strong>Once accepted, the arrangements to complete a transfer are the responsibility of the sending state. We continue to receive transfers, including of children, into the UK under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dublin-iii-regulation\">Dublin III </a>regulation and remain committed to meeting our obligations.\u201d</p> <p>But lawyers and Safe Passage say the Home Office does have an obligation to help make the transfers happen.</p> <p>Anastasia Solopova, at Wilson Solicitors, is working to help a 15-year-old Kuwaiti boy stranded in Samos despite having permission to join his refugee brother in the UK. \u201cThere are obligations on both the UK and the state in which the child is located to ensure that<em> </em>the transfer takes place as quickly as possible\u201d, she said. \u201cImportantly, the Home Office must have the child\u2019s best interests as a primary consideration in all procedures under the Dublin regulation.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office must act urgently while indirect flights are still available. We have asked the Home Office co-operate with the Greek authorities to transfer my client to the UK. Otherwise my client, an unaccompanied and extremely vulnerable child, may be stranded in the dangerous conditions of the Samos reception identification centre for months on end.\u201d</p> <p>The process of family reunion is a lengthy one, taking up to a year to arrange, while minors waiting for transfer often live in uncertain and difficult conditions.</p> <p>The Guardian also spoke to Ibrahim, originally from Afghanistan, who spent months going through the family reunion process. He is worried his brother won\u2019t be protected from Covid-19 in France, where he has no support.</p> <p>\u201cWe went through a long process to prove he is my brother,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, after 10 months, on 6 March we were told he can come. Now nobody can travel. We lost all our family, our mum, sister, brother and he is just 15. He has no friends or family in France so day by day all I think about is my brother and he worries the same.\u201d</p> <p>Safe Passage director Beth Gardiner-Smith said the Home Office needs to take a proactive role in bringing the young people to be safe with their families.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe all appreciate that the government is under enormous pressure but we are asking for some creative thinking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees\">NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Home Office could include these young people in their plans to use charter flights to rescue British people who are stranded in Europe. In 2015 when the jungle camp in Calais was demolished, the UK government took matters into their own hands. There was a situation where 1,000 children were going to be dispersed and rather than wait for French action they decided to be proactive and bring the children to the UK.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for UNHCR told the Guardian that family reunion transfers should continue. \u201cWhile Dublin transfers are suspended by most if not all EU countries, UNHCR is advocating to maintain transfers for family reunion purposes especially for unaccompanied children in view of their particular vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed said: \u201cI am prepared to pay for Wahid\u2019s flight, but the Greek authorities say I can\u2019t do that. I need the UK Home Office to help me make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>He is terrified that his brother will end up on the streets during a strict lockdown.\u201cI have been paying for a room for him but the landlord says he can only stay in his place until 12 April. Refugees on Samos don\u2019t even have tents, he will have to go and sleep in the wood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how long this lockdown will last and I don\u2019t know if airports will close tomorrow or next week.

  "<p>Amged el-Hawrani thought he just had the flu. He thought maybe he was just a bit run down or hadn\u2019t been sleeping enough. By the time he was admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties and put on a ventilator, it was already too late. Three weeks later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/first-nhs-consultant-dies-from-covid-19\">he died </a>of Covid-19. He was 55 years old.</p> <p>The NHS ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant never knew he had the virus. He was sedated long before the test came back positive, after twice coming back negative. The diagnosis until the final test result was a stubborn bilateral pneumonia. A physician to the end, his last words before being sedated were \u201cwhy are they taking so long, they need to intubate me\u201d.</p> <p>As an ENT surgery consultant he was especially vulnerable to catching Covid-19, and was likely exposed to patients whose complaints were coronavirus-related: loss of taste and smell, breathing issues and persistent coughs. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even aware he needed protective gear,\u201d his brother Amal told me, \u201che was just doing his job.\u201d</p> <p>El-Hawrani was one of six boys whose Sudanese parents settled in the UK in 1975. Their late father, a consultant radiologist, moved to the UK to gain access to the latest equipment and research in his speciality, and passed on his passion for medicine to his eldest sons. \u201cHe had no hobbies, he was always studying, always reading, he loved it,\u201d Amal recalls.</p> <p>The love for the vocation extended outside of the family, as the El-Hawrani home became a hub for other Sudanese doctors in training. Those who needed advice and guidance on their professional journey, or just needed a place to stay as they did so, found refuge in the El-Hawrani home, rent free. The commitment to family and medicine was passed down. \u201cMost of my dad\u2019s time was dedicated towards his family,\u201d said El-Hawrani\u2019s son, Ashraf, \u201cthe rest was dedicated towards his profession.\u201d</p> <p>Today, the close-knit family, and the wider medical community of friends around it, cannot even seek some small comfort in mourning together. Alongside the shock of El-Hawrani\u2019s death now lies the dread of the disease infecting his mother, who is in her late 70s. Her sons have isolated themselves from her and each other, and turned away mourners.</p> <p>El-Hawrani<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/worrying-event-deaths-of-nhs-doctors-from-covid-19-stark-reminder-of-pandemic\"> was the second frontline doctor to die of the virus</a>. The first was also of Sudanese origin; Dr Adil El Tayar, an organ transplant specialist who volunteered in an A&amp;E department in the Midlands to help fight the virus. Two of the four children he left behind are also NHS doctors. </p> <p>Following their deaths, the contributions of El-Hawrani and El Tayar and their families to our healthcare system have been held up as exemplars. Yes, they were gifted and selfless, but they were not exceptions. They were part of a community of NHS doctors all over the UK, who are foreign born, or born to immigrants.</p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s, El-Hawrani and his siblings grew up in a country matter-of-factly hostile to people of colour. His younger brother Amal recalls being told by other children that he couldn\u2019t play with them because he was brown. Thirty years later, the UK is more diverse, but the antipathy towards immigrants has crept upwards, voiced by politicians instead of schoolchildren. The narrative they set for the country in general, and the NHS in particular, is that they are being drained by immigrants who put nothing in and take everything out. This was always a lie, but it has never been a more discreditable one than now.</p> <p>Alongside El-Hawrani and El Tayar in the honour roll now sit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/retired-hospital-medical-director-latest-to-die-from-covid-19-in-uk\">Dr Alfa Saadu</a>, who was also volunteering, this time in Hertfordshire, one of the counties worst hit by the virus; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/uk-doctors-coronavirus-deaths-highlight-crucial-role-bame-medics\">general practitioner Dr Habib Zaidi</a>; and Areema Nasreen, an acute medical unit nurse. The numbers do, and have always told the truth: <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-09-06/9132/\">44% of medical staff are BAME</a>. For nurses and midwives, it is <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/nursingmidwifery/delivering-the-nhs-ltp/cno-black-and-minority-ethnic-bme-leadership/\">one in every five</a>, and in some areas such as London, it is <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/nursingmidwifery/delivering-the-nhs-ltp/cno-black-and-minority-ethnic-bme-leadership/\">four </a><a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/nursingmidwifery/delivering-the-nhs-ltp/cno-black-and-minority-ethnic-bme-leadership/\">in 10</a>.</p> <p>Not that the government has made it easy for non-EU migrant doctors to work in the UK. They have to navigate a complex maze of Home Office requirements to renew expensive work visas which are often tied to jobs which are themselves dependent on budgetary constraints<strong>.</strong> A single fallen domino in this chain ejects a sorely needed doctor from the country.</p> <p>In its newfound affection for the NHS and such doctors, the government has now shown hitherto unattainable bureaucratic agility, and decided that all nurses, doctors, paramedics and healthcare professionals will have their <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">visas automatically renewed</a> for a year free of charge.</p> <p>Many of these migrant doctors will be paying a hefty annual NHS surcharge for the privilege of using an NHS they staff, in addition to paying tax and national insurance contributions. This surcharge is set to rise from <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/immigration-health-surcharge-rising-to-624-in-october-2020/\">\u00a3400 to \u00a3624 a year this October</a>. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who in November declared that the NHS surcharge was going to be extended because \u201cit\u2019s the National Health Service not the International Health Service\u201d, on Thursday saluted those NHS staffers who perished as \u201cpeople who came to this country to make a difference\u201d.</p> <p>These are likely to be temporary face- and life-saving platitudes and measures. When it\u2019s back to business as usual, when the NHS is used as a political pawn, and blame for its underfunding is placed at the feet of migrants, remember Amged El-Hawrani and all the others who fell on its frontline to save lives. Remember their names, their faces, their stories and the families they left behind. And remember that the NHS is not drained by migrants, but sustained by them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist<br></p></li> </ul>",

She lives in Perth and her second child is due June. What was the likelihood, she asked, of Western Australia moving to a hard border before then? Should she ask our mother, who like me lives in Melbourne, to travel there this week, two and a half months early, because at least then, after 14 days of quarantine, she would be allowed in?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-cancelled-my-wedding-and-made-me-sick-what-now\">Coronavirus cancelled my wedding and made me sick.

I am not sure this was the right advice.</p> <p>There are exemptions to domestic border restrictions on compassionate grounds. But compassion is usually reserved for death, not birth.</p> <p>Hospitals and doctor\u2019s clinics have cracked down on visitors, meaning my sister will attend her last few prenatal visits on her own. Partners are still allowed to attend the birth of their children. Under coronavirus, major life events are strictly enumerated. Five people may attend a wedding. Ten a funeral. Two, excluding medical staff and babies, a birth.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a message from another friend. Also pregnant, also needing to overcome the border with WA. She had told her parents not to visit, lest they get stuck here. When would she be able to see them next?</p> <p>Conventional wisdom states that you can never really plan for your pregnancy. But surely, usually, you can plan more than this. In an ordinary time, even if the worst were to happen, you could rely on your support networks to be there. I could rely on being able to be there, to hold my sister if it all went wrong and to hold the new tiny baby and distract my three-year-old nephew with elaborate toy train disasters if all goes well.</p> <p>But now the world is frozen in amber and I\u2019m crashing trains over video chat. My nephew wakes every morning and assures his parents in the serious tone of the very young that they will be able to go outside \u201cwhen it all calms down\u201d. He is parroting one of them, though they can\u2019t remember who.</p> <p>On Thursday our questions were answered: 11.59pm Sunday was when the hard border would take effect. All West Australians who wanted to return were advised to do so before then. Premier Mark McGowan was realising WA\u2019s long-held secessionist dream, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-update-live-news-australia-nsw-victoria-queensland-qld-tas-act-sa-wa-nt-covid19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8586b08f0866297e9f5739#block-5e8586b08f0866297e9f5739\">making the state \u201can island within an island.\u201d</a></p> <p>\u201cIf you are an eastern-stater, and thinking about visiting WA \u2013 forget about it,\u201d McGowan said.</p> <p>This was a hard rule, McGowan said, but it was necessary to protect WA. It was the same line, edited for location, used by the premiers and chief ministers of Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania, all of which have introduced domestic borders of various porosity.</p> <p>We have never lived further from our families. For many non-Indigenous Australians, this is our first experience of having our movement restricted, our access to parts of the country denied. We have always been able to go anywhere we wanted, and often left a mess.</p> <p>Now we are restricted, and for good reason. I don\u2019t dispute the utility of border controls in a pandemic that spreads through the movement of people. These strict rules, combined with mandatory quarantine for overseas travellers and social distancing measures, have seen the daily growth rate of coronavirus cases drop from 25% in the last week of March to 5% in the first week of April.</p> <p>And my family is incredibly lucky.

  "<p>Australia faces a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to help its neighbours in the Pacific and other vulnerable countries to stop the spread of coronavirus, aid groups have declared.</p> <p>But at a time when the need for support at home and abroad has intensified, not-for-profit organisations have raised concerns about <a

Sunday the government bowed to calls for charities to be granted easier access to the new wage subsidies amid fears that many would have missed out because of the way their funding is structured.</p> <p>Care Australia, an international humanitarian aid organisation with 90 staff in Australia and a support network of more than 700 staff across the region, said it had to suspend face-to-face fundraising in March amid tighter social distancing rules.</p> <p>It also expected donations to drop over the coming months because potential contributors were losing their jobs or facing uncertain economic times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

coronavirus \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Its chief executive, Peter Walton, said it would be a tragedy if organisations like his had to consider staff cuts when the need for their work was greater than ever.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to think about how we can do everything we need to [stop the spread of coronavirus] here in Australia,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cBut coronavirus isn\u2019t going to be defeated if we\u2019re not defeating it everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is a moral imperative that if we really want things to return to normal in Australia, we have to think about how we also make it return to normal within our region and more broadly as quickly as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Walton said the pandemic would have health and economic repercussions that would hit some of the world\u2019s poorest much harder, including in war zones, refugee camps and disaster zones.</p> <p>He said while Australia had one doctor to 280 people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/papua-new-guinea-declares-state-of-emergency-after-first-coronavirus-case\">Papua New Guinea</a>\u2019s ratio was more like one to 18,000.</p> <p>Walton noted that a category five cyclone was bearing down on Vanuatu, which is yet to confirm any cases of Covid-19 but has been in a state of emergency for weeks.</p> <p>Not only was it difficult to send in international support, localised responses such as cyclone-safe centralised evacuation centres were not compatible with physical distancing.</p> <p>\u201cSo we really are in uncharted territory and I\u2019m deeply, deeply concerned about the countries in our region,\u201d Walton said.</p> <p>His concerns were backed up by other aid groups.</p> <p>Lyn Morgain, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said she was gravely worried for the millions living in refugee camps across the globe, where self-isolation and social-distancing protocols were \u201ccompletely unrealistic\u201d and any outbreak \u201cwould spread like wildfire\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cJust weeks ago I visited the Rohingya refugee camp at Cox\u2019s Bazar in Bangladesh, which is severely overcrowded with 40,000 people per square kilometre,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian government must contribute its fair share to the UN\u2019s appeal to help poor countries contain and respond to the virus, as well as to respond to the looming economic crisis, which will plunge millions more people into poverty.\u201d</p> <p>The head of Plan International Australia, Susanne Legena, said while positive signs were emerging to suggest Australia was \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of Covid-19 infections, achieving this in developing countries would be \u201cinfinitely more challenging\u201d.</p> <p>Something as simple as accessing soap and water to wash hands was a daily challenge, she said, while physical distancing was difficult in heavily populated areas.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no doubt whatsoever that the Covid-19 crisis is on a path to overwhelm national health systems, badly damage economies and put millions of children at significant risk of harm,\u201d Legena said.</p> <p>\u201cGirls, in particular, face increased threats of sexual violence, discrimination and abuse as they do in any emergency situation.\u201d</p> <p>The chief executive of ChildFund Australia, Margaret Sheehan, said Covid-19 threatened not only the physical health and wellbeing of children and families, but the hard-fought development advances of the past 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a real risk that many communities will back-slide into extreme poverty,\u201d said Sheehan, whose organisation has been assisting the emergency response in PNG.</p> <aside class=\"element

It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</li> \n   <li>Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes. </li> \n   <li>A sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65e88f08c9eaf0daf04c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:13:24.910Z\">12.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US president Donald Trump opened tonight\u2019s White House briefing with well wishes for UK PM Boris Johnson. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend of mine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is going to be fine, he\u2019s a strong man, a strong person.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65658f08c35a1d11a814\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:11:14.340Z\">12.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Johnson\u2019s hospital admission suggests virus may have progressed</h2> \n  <p>Most people recover from Covid-19 within a week and cannot even be certain they had it, as they probably won\u2019t be tested.

Spain has recorded 130,759 confirmed cases, according to the health ministry. </p> \n  <p>The latest data suggests the growth in the number of infections has slowed to around 5% \u2013 the smallest increase seen since officials began tracking the outbreak. The actual number of cases in the country, however, is likely higher after hard-hit regions such as Madrid and Catalonia instructed people with mild symptoms to self-isolate rather than seek testing,</p> \n  <p>While officials urged caution in interpreting the data, they noted the figures hint at a downward trend, with fewer hospitalisations and a drop in patients needing critical care. \u201cThe sense that we\u2019re getting from the regions is that the pressure is easing,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected after three weeks of distancing measures.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hans Kluge of the World Health Organization echoed her cautious tone. \u201cCareful optimism as a result of bold measures, innovative approaches and courageous decisions,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1246732106946023430\">he wrote on Twitter</a> after wrapping up a mission to Spain. </p> \n  <p>He added that he had been deeply impressed by the heroism of the country\u2019s frontline workers and the solidarity among Spain\u2019s residents.</p> \n  <p> The impact of the virus has been widespread across the country, which not a single Spanish region spared. As the number of cases continues its steady climb upwards, a handful of municipalities have cut themselves off from the rest of Spain \u2013 and the world \u2013 in hopes of keeping the virus out.</p> \n  <p>Among the most fervent is the southern Spanish municipality of Zahara de la Sierra. Home to some 1,400 people and perched high on a mountain, local officials have used chains and fences to block off all but one of the five access roads to the white village.</p> \n  <p> Police keep constant watch over the one road that remains open, stopping every vehicle that passes to ensure they have the necessary authorisation to enter the town. </p> \n  <p>Those that are allowed through are sprayed with disinfectant before they can proceed up to the fortress town. \u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have one (coronavirus) case in this municipality, nor anyone in quarantine,\u201d mayor Santiago Galv\u00e1n told Europa Press. </p> \n  <p> Nearby, the village of Setenil de las Bodegas has also sprang into action. Popular with daytrippers who flock to visit its houses built into the rocks that loom over the village, officials have dumped hundreds of kilograms of dirt to block off most roads leading into the municipality.</p> \n  <p> Home to some 2,700 people, the local council <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1243961681346248705\">recently announced plans to disinfect</a> all of the streets of the village on a daily basis while any vehicle that enters must pass under a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1244986737052524545\">custom-built arch</a> that showers them with disinfectant.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T12:20:42.889Z\">at 1.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e89c4398f080bdb9f53482d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T11:45:52.497Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Singapore </strong>has recorded a 60% increase in coronavirus cases in a single day.</p> \n  <p>The county\u2019s health ministry reported 120 new cases of the virus on Sunday, in comparison to 75 on Saturday.
