  "<p>When Loto* saw the police arrive at the rural property in New Zealand where he had been held captive for nearly two years, the man who had imprisoned him there told him to run. Instead, Loto quietly waited to be discovered by police.</p> <p>Loto had spent 17 months being held as a slave on a property in Hastings on New Zealand\u2019s North Island. He was never paid for his work and was subject to cruel beatings from Joseph Auga Matamata, a 65-year-old Samoan chief, or <em>matai</em>.</p> <p>Nine days before police arrived at the property in January 2017, Loto had begged another Samoan he had met working at a plant nursery<strong> </strong>to report him to the police for overstaying his visa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/samoan-chief-found-guilty-of-enslaving-villagers-in-new-zealand-over-25-years\">Samoan chief found guilty of enslaving villagers in New Zealand over 25 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before he was deported, Loto told police his story, triggering one of the largest and most complex immigration investigations ever undertaken by officials in both New Zealand and Samoa. Eventually, officials uncovered a web of offending by Matamata spanning 25 years.</p> <p>On 16 March, more than three years after Loto escaped from Matamata\u2019s control, following a five-week trial, Matamata stood silently in the dock at the high court in Napier as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/samoan-chief-found-guilty-of-enslaving-villagers-in-new-zealand-over-25-years\">he was convicted on 13 counts of dealing in slaves</a> and 10 counts of human trafficking between 1994 and April 2019. It is the first time that anyone has been simultaneously convicted of both charges in New Zealand. His oldest victim was Loto, at 53, his youngest victim was just 12.</p> <h2>Chores, abuse and beatings</h2> <p>Despite their cases spanning decades, the stories the victims told over the five-week trial were similar: they met Matamata in Samoa and he paid for their flights and visas to New Zealand, promising them work or schooling. But upon arrival they found themselves working 14-hour days in the fields as \u201cbags of cash\u201d were handed to Matamata, a horticultural contractor, but never passed on.</p> <p>After working in the fields all day they did chores around his home late into the night and were subjected to brutal beatings if work was not completed to his liking. They were not allowed to leave his property without permission, speak to anyone at work or church, or talk to their families in Samoa.</p> <p>The crown prosecutor Clayton Walker told the jury that all of Matamata\u2019s victims \u201ctrusted him completely\u201d because he was a <em>matai, </em>a Samoan chief.</p> <p>\u201cThat trust was misplaced. He abused his matai position.\u201d</p> <p>Loto, who arrived in New Zealand in winter 2015, says that he was often punished for working too slowly, having to \u201coffer\u201d up his head for Matamata to hit with a piece of wood, a power cord, secateurs or a broom.</p> <p>At the beginning of the trial Matamata often wore an <em>\u2019ulafala</em>, a bright red pandanus key necklace symbolising his chiefly status over his suit and tie. As the weeks wore on it gave way to a black hoodie. He sat quietly, sometimes smiling, often looking bored, as his victims gave evidence against him. None of them returned his gaze.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That trust was misplaced.

Her day started at 4am and often didn\u2019t finish until 11pm.</p> <p>A 15-year-old boy, who was adopted by Matamata and brought to New Zealand when he was 12, described how his adopted father once threw a pair of secateurs at him so hard they lodged in his arm.</p> <p>When Matamata finally took the witness stand he denied everything, saying he never assaulted anyone, his visitors did not have to follow strict rules, and the fence around his property was there to \u201cprotect his family\u201d in a dangerous neighbourhood. He claimed he had brought people to New Zealand for a \u201choliday\u201d, not work, and it was out of his control if they ran away and became overstayers.</p> <p>\u201cI am a <em>matai</em>.

The dominant issue was aged care.

Victoria was slow, but would come in forcefully later. \u201cThere really was no national leadership at that point,\u201d the official says.</p> <p>Morrison and the government would doubtless contest this assessment by pointing to the steady accumulation of action since 20 January.

Live coverage could barely keep pace with events. But inside the cavernous football stadium, the Coag meeting started with the preordained agenda. There were briefings from the Reserve Bank of Australia and from Treasury. Murphy, the chief medical officer, also supplied a detailed briefing. The leaders then broke for a cup of tea.</p> <p>Running parallel with the leaders, health advisers from the states were also conferring by teleconference. Murphy was shuttling between the leaders meeting and the teleconference. Victoria, which had recorded the first case of community transmission that Friday, and Queensland, pushed during the discussion for stronger and more urgent action to force social distancing. People familiar with the dynamic in the meeting of medical officers insist it wasn\u2019t a boil over, but the forward-leaning states insisted more was needed. They sought a consensus to craft new, stronger, recommendations to be put to the leaders.</p> <p>Murphy conveyed that shift to the leaders meeting. That news hit the group like a thunderclap. Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye. Officials were promptly turfed out of the room and the leaders were left in a huddle, in a cavernous, empty football stadium in western Sydney, to determine what to do next.</p> <p>The table had been set for lunch. Lunch didn\u2019t happen. Tumult happened. But within the hour, entirely on the hop, nine political leaders had invented a new governance structure. No papers, no proposals, no guidance from officials. Morrison suggested they manage the crisis by convening regularly as a national cabinet. The proposal materialised in the room. The states agreed and insisted the group just be them, first ministers \u2013 no opposition leaders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government's coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group created an emergency national government of nine. Morrison later bolted in the national cabinet as a subcommittee of the regular cabinet.</p> <p>The leaders then moved to the discussion about imposing new limits on crowds, and how that would be announced to the public. There was a debate about when the proposed restriction should commence. Now, or Monday? Did people need to be given notice given it was now mid-afternoon on a Friday and events were scheduled for the weekend? There was a view some notice was required.</p> <p>Morrison war gamed in the leaders huddle about whether going to the opening game of the NRL season on Saturday night \u2013 something the prime minister had been foregrounding for days \u2013 would be a good or a bad signal. Would people be unsettled if he suddenly wasn\u2019t going? The leaders resolved the position they would telegraph, and emerged, and Morrison announced there would be a ban on non-essential gatherings of 500, effective Monday. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2020/mar/13/scott-morrison-defends-decision-to-attend-rugby-league-game-during-coronavirus-outbreak-video\">said he\u2019d be going to the football on Saturday night</a> because there was no cause for alarm, and \u201cit might be the last game I get to go to for a very long time\u201d.</p> <p>The day wasn\u2019t yet over.

The next one played out over the following weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/australias-coronavirus-toll-covid-19-related-deaths-across-the-country\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus toll: Covid-19 related deaths across the country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Covid-19 is a health crisis that has triggered the most profound economic shock since the global financial crisis. Morrison has told colleagues the impact of this pandemic will be more far-reaching than the Depression. As the world wobbles, Australia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/australian-prime-minister-to-ask-global-leaders-to-fund-urgent-research-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">worried about failed states</a>, and the risk of a global sovereign debt crisis.</p> <p>The national government is responsible for economic wellbeing. This crisis has triggered a legitimate dialogue between the tiers of government about protecting lives and livelihoods; how to craft public health measures that save lives without deepening an economic crisis that would threaten wellbeing in other ways. Morrison wanted to craft measures that would enable Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/overseas-arrivals-to-australia-to-be-quarantined-in-hotels-for-two-weeks-over-coronavirus\">economy to move into a period of hibernation</a>, and he wanted to sequence the inevitable health restrictions to flatten the curve of infections with bursts of significant fiscal firepower.</p> <p>The economic response to this crisis is massive, as it was a decade ago during the global financial crisis. The Morrison government is drawing on the central bank, on the Council of Financial Regulators, on the retail banks, on big corporates, on coordination commissions. Public servants are being redeployed to frontline agencies. Sacked call centre workers are being picked up by Centrelink, and working in contact-tracing call centres in the states. Morrison and Frydenberg are talking regularly to their counterparts overseas.</p> <p>While the economy is largely Canberra\u2019s problem, the states manage health systems, and there was concern in the two most populous states that tough restrictions necessary to stop infections were not moving fast enough. Which brings us to the events of the weekend of 21 and 22 March.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was this weekend where the inevitable tension in the federation between saving jobs and preventing unmanageable numbers of ICU patients reached its peak, and manifested publicly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/as-australia-goes-off-the-coronavirus-cliff-the-question-is-how-hard-will-it-land\">sonic boom Sunday</a>.</p> <p>The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, had endured a terrible few days.

A tipping point had been reached.</p> <p>In Canberra, Morrison was hunkered down with colleagues finalising the government\u2019s second stimulus package. The plan was to unveil the $66bn worth of new measures on Sunday. Journalists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/scott-morrison-to-announce-66bn-stimulus-including-income-support-for-workers\">briefed late on Saturday</a> so stories could appear in the Sunday papers and on the political shows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/03/how-has-the-morrison-government-responded-to-the-coronavirus-crisis-australian-politics-live-podcast\">How has the Morrison government responded to the coronavirus crisis? \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in Sydney and Melbourne, Berejiklian and Andrews were alarmed. They felt public health restrictions needed to be imposed more quickly, because people were ignoring polite entreaties from politicians and chief medical officers. Canberra was not blocking action, but a dialogue about how hard to go with social distancing restrictions that would force businesses to close remained unresolved.</p> <p>Berejiklian and Andrews were in touch throughout Saturday, into Saturday night and then again Sunday morning. Berejiklian told Morrison on Saturday night that NSW and Victoria wanted to implement the first stage of restrictions pronto \u2013 the closure of places like pubs and clubs. She said the two states were prepared to move ahead of other jurisdictions if there wasn\u2019t prompt consensus through the national cabinet.</p> <p>Not all states were persuaded that it was time to force widespread lockdowns, and worried they would be dragged along in the slipstream when there wasn\u2019t a solid evidence base. Politically it would be hard for premiers to explain to their constituents why some states were moving and they were not. One official from another state says: \u201cWe [were] moving ahead of the health advice, and all the political pressure is to go further; to be out in front of this\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the ACT was fully on board with the NSW/Victoria view that stage one lockdowns had to happen, and now. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, noted there could not be one rule for Canberra and another for Queanbeyan. A leaders meeting scheduled originally for Tuesday had been brought forward to Sunday evening.</p> <p>The two premiers were not mucking around. Morrison was in his courtyard in Canberra about two-thirds of the way through unveiling stimulus round two when a reporter from the Nine Network asked the prime minister to comment on a new push by NSW and Victoria \u201cfor a total shutdown on non-essential businesses\u201d. The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet, and the news channels were broadcasting live.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/it-will-change-my-life-entirely-young-people-on-getting-the-550-coronavirus-supplement\">'It will change my life entirely': young people on getting the $550 coronavirus supplement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrison was not pleased by the political firebomb, but he ploughed on. He responded by saying he would be guided by the health advice that was currently being prepared by the chief medical officers. If he had a view, he would be expressing it in the national cabinet, not on the hop to journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s the orderly and calm way to deal with these things, and to make decisions in a responsible manner.\u201d</p> <p>Public statements from the two states followed confirming that was in fact the position: restrictions needed to happen, and they were prepared to go in advance of others. Victoria upped the ante by signalling it would close schools from Tuesday. The national cabinet had been jolted into more urgency on the health side. The view in the states intent on pushing the envelope was this was a necessary jolt, delivered just in the nick of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863/0_0_6720_4480/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that night, after the national cabinet discussion, Morrison fronted the cameras and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/victoria-nsw-lockdowns-scott-morrison-coronavirus-national-cabinet\">confirmed pubs and clubs would close</a>. Restaurants and cafes would be restricted to takeaway only. Schools, confusingly, seemed to be both open and closed.</p> <p>Given the obvious tumult of the day, Morrison also felt compelled to affirm the national cabinet had not splintered. The self-created government of nine had mauled, inelegantly, to a point of consensus. It has weathered its first big test. \u201cAll of its members are very committed to its processes and decisions,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <h2>The new normal</h2> <p>This pandemic is close. It casts a shadow. \u201cWe are all next to it,\u201d Josh Frydenberg tells Guardian Australia while downing a late dinner in his Canberra digs one night this week. As the treasurer was working up the third economic support package in as many weeks \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/from-tight-purse-strings-to-massive-fiscal-firepower-the-coalitions-staggering-transformation\">$130bn for wages subsidies the government unfurled early this week</a> \u2013 his cousin was seriously ill in intensive care in a Melbourne hospital. Frydenberg\u2019s cousin had picked up the virus during a trip to London with his wife, and soon succumbed to a high temperature and breathing difficulties. Fortunately, he is now recovering well.</p> <p>After the watershed weekend in March, the public health restrictions have only gathered pace. Stage one was followed quickly by stages two and three. One of the recent national cabinets decreed that gatherings would go from 10 to two. Some insiders say the health advice going into the meeting was to maintain the restriction at 10, but leaders defaulted to two. Queensland pushed for one of the more recent measures \u2013 quarantining returning travellers in hotels. The state argued that particular measure would have the biggest positive impact on infection rates without inflicting more pain on the general community.</p> <p>Messaging at the beginning was confusing, and at times contradictory. But the public health messaging has become simpler, and more forceful. Stay home, unless there is a very good reason to go out. The commonwealth meanwhile keeps rolling out economic support. Wages subsidies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare</a>, at least for some. Support for tenants and landlords.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e603c8445074b6071f2cfeb60d41166a518a4e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e603c8445074b6071f2cfeb60d41166a518a4e96/0_0_4821_3212/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A closed Bronte beach in Sydney with the words #StayHome written into the sand by local lifeguards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed Bronte beach in Sydney with the words #StayHome written into the sand by local lifeguards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new normal is uncomfortable. It is disconcerting. Gathering places that once teemed with life are empty. States are walled off. The businesses still open wonder when they will have to close their doors. The federal parliament is only sitting in short sessions to pass specific measures. Liberty has been curtailed by emergency powers now in place across all the states and territories, enforced by state police. It is reasonable to wonder how long the public will consent to these arrangements. Australia is a vibrant, noisy, democracy, not a police state.</p> <p>Things feel grim, because they are grim. The suspension of ordinary existence is absolutely necessary in the service of saving lives, but we have entered a new normal that could persist not for six months, which is the timeframe invoked most regularly by political leaders, but for a year. Or two.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Tony Bartone</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The medical profession remains on the fence about whether the governments of Australia are currently getting the balance right. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, tells Guardian Australia that can only be judged with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cThe truth of the matter is governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially,\u201d Bartone says.</p> <p>\u201cWe can raise all number of reasons about why that\u2019s the case including mixed messaging, poor information and communication, and indifference by younger sections of the community who thought it was an old person\u2019s disease and they didn\u2019t have to worry. For all those reasons, governments have had to take the community on a conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Bartone also cautions against some of the optimistic commentary that has emerged over the course of the past week that Australia has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">begun to flatten the curve of new infections</a>. \u201cWe are flattening it but remember that also, we had a big spike in numbers last week and previously because half the Australian population abroad returned home before the lockdowns.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

I sent him a text the other night to say no prime minister in our lifetime has had to face down something as significant as this, and that national cabinet is working extremely well, and this was a fantastic suggestion from him and we are all very grateful to be acting as one government almost, if you like, across the country rather than nine of us doing our own thing.\u201d</p> <p>He says the federation creates a tension reflecting divided responsibilities. \u201cThere is that tension, that\u2019s perfectly healthy and appropriate. It\u2019s a big thing to close businesses and see people stood down. These are massive decisions to make and there is a very big toll that comes with that including anxiety and all sorts of other issues, often tragic issues, like increased family violence rates for instance and all sorts of other mental health considerations. It\u2019s not a bad thing that we are all grappling with that very difficult choice, trying to smash the virus and trying to preserve the economy as much as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Barr says the ad hoc government of nine is learning on its feet. \u201cWe are getting there now but we weren\u2019t quite there initially around fully appreciating how much the health curve would impact on the economic outcome. I think that gap is now being closed.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a few things that in hindsight you would like to have got there a week to 10 days earlier, but we have got there, sometimes just in time. What I would like to see in the next phase of this is we are not playing catch-up so much; that we are shaping the future a bit more rather than reacting to the past.\u201d</p> <p>Barr insists the national cabinet has brought out the best in the federation, and could, in fact, be a segue to a newer, more effective style of politics and governance. \u201cThis mechanism has forced cooperation that we haven\u2019t seen before. The level of information sharing is much improved from the case before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/australia-coronavirus-shutdown-rules-stage-3-not-lockdown-what-is-closed-open-restrictions\">Australia coronavirus shutdown: what is open, closed and banned under the current rules?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you were observing that national cabinet from outside and you knew nothing about Australian politics you wouldn\u2019t know which side of the fence people were on.

<p>These measures are a clear indication of their important status both in times of crisis and beyond and the role they play in ensuring the justice system continues to function effectively.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The justice system is adapting to the crisis by postponing most non-urgent cases and conducting some cases remotely online.

Jamie Potter, Partner at Bindmans, said:<br><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The social distancing measures being put in place by government are clearly important, but they cannot be used to disproportionately interfere in the rights of those with protected characteristics, particularly those with mental illness, autism or similar conditions that necessitate leaving the house more than once per day. </p> \n   <p>Such rights can clearly co-exist with the health measures being put in place and Parliament clearly did not think it necessary to impose the once per day restriction arbitrarily introduced by the government. It is essential the government needs to rethink this restrictive policy and allow appropriate flexibility where it is necessary and justified.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One of the affected families instructing Bindmans said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The government must consider the vital needs of disabled people and their families, many of whom now have considerably reduced support, while managing the coronavirus crisis, including essential social distancing. Without these considerations, the current situation risks becoming unmanageable for them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8755a38f0866297e9f6992\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T15:26:50.790Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38885a67fbb87077071c2448a9722900731196f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38885a67fbb87077071c2448a9722900731196f/0_0_2804_2944/952..jpg\" alt=\"A brightly painted \u2018thank you NHS\u2019 picture in a shop window in Penarth, Wales.\" width=\"952\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A brightly painted \u2018thank you NHS\u2019 picture in a shop window in Penarth, Wales.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8753fd8f08532a0e667886\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T15:21:31.529Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A will company is waiving fees for those working in the NHS after experiencing a 12-fold increase in the number of requests from such workers in March compared to December.<br><br><strong>Farewill</strong> is waiving its \u00a390 fee to make a will, the company\u2019s chief executive, Dan Garrett, said. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve seen demand for our services increase recently and we\u2019ve done everything we can to meet it, taking on around 20 extra staff.

But the assessment will be kept confidential and not shared with individual students.</p> \n  <p>Schools have been asked to submit data to their examination boards from 29 May, and Ofqual said it hopes to announce grades by the time they would normally have been published in mid-August or earlier if possible.</p> \n  <p>While this covers pupils taking A-levels and GCSEs, those taking BTecs or other vocational or technical qualifications will have to wait, as will external or private candidates such as home-schooled pupils.</p> \n  <p>You can read the full story <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">Exam regulator unveils GCSE and A-level plans for coronavirus crisis</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T16:02:02.992Z\">at 5.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e871b1f8f087564da1e5219\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T11:17:55.788Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26ef783be2e41986c427448fc53e6a5942c26831\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26ef783be2e41986c427448fc53e6a5942c26831/0_87_3500_2099/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The plaque unveiled at the NHS Nightingale hospital in London says it was opened by the Prince of Wales on 3 April.

  "<p>Jack Schofield, who has died aged 72 after suffering a heart attack, was one of the outstanding computer journalists of his era, a reputation he established as editor of Computer Guardian from 1985 to 1994, and maintained until the end of his life. He never stopped working, recently filing the latest of his popular Ask Jack columns for the Guardian as well as a regular Just the Basics column for Which? Computing magazine, providing a masterly full guide to the arcane intricacies of file-wrangling.</p> <p>Jack\u2019s lasting legacy is invisible \u2013 improving the computer literacy of thousands of readers over decades through his painstaking advice and his inability to refuse help to anyone who sought his guidance.</p> <p>He started writing for the Guardian in October 1983. For the previous 18 months there had been a lively debate within the paper about the viability of a computer section. When finally approved, Tim Radford and I were launch editors for Futures Micro Guardian, as it was called. As publication date neared we realised that we needed a columnist. At the time, I used to read Practical Computing, so I rang its editor and asked if he would like to write the first column. When he said yes, I added that maybe he had better write the following two while he was at it. Jack kept writing for the Guardian from then on. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/16/how-buy-computer-1983-archive\" title=\"\">first column</a>, with a cartoon by Larry, was a guide for first-time buyers of computers, and after considering all the runners, including the BBC \u201cB\u201d, he thought the best value machine was the Sinclair Spectrum, costing between \u00a3100 and \u00a3130.</p> <p>Two years later he joined the staff of the paper to edit the section rebranded as Computer Guardian to embrace wider commercial realities as well as personal computing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/16/guardian-technology-section\" title=\"\">In an article about the history of the organisation\u2019s computer coverage, Jack wrote</a>: \u201cThe paper\u2019s commercial strategy was to try to dominate the graduate recruitment market, and in the 1980s, IT was a growing business with plenty of job ads to chase.\u201d</p> <p>Jack carried with him an unrivalled wealth of knowledge about the history and technicalities of the computing industry. \u201cComputer Guardian covered everything from talking teddy bears to supercomputers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe covered microcomputers from Acorn, Amstrad, Atari, Commodore and Sinclair. These were extremely popular at the time, mainly for playing games, so I added a column of games reviews.\u201d</p> <p>His backlog of knowledge was so extensive that hardly any innovations came up that he could not trace the roots of. Few things were really new in Jack\u2019s encyclopaedic mind. He was writing about the currently fashionable <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot\" title=\"\">Internet of Things</a> well over 20 years ago and had been writing about Google for just as long. </p> <p>Bill Thompson, a former head of the Guardian\u2019s New Media Lab, remembered him as one of the most supportive editors he ever had, who gave him his first break in the national press. He recalled one occasion when a source told him that Acorn \u2013 manufacturers of the BBC microcomputer \u2013 was about to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/mar/08/onlinesupplement5\" title=\"\"> spin its subsidiary ARM (Advanced RISC Machine, originally Acorn RISC Machine) off into a separate company</a>. Jack called their press office, which denied it completely. A few weeks later it happened, and from then on Jack referred to Acorn as \u201cItalian-owned Acorn Computers\u201d.</p> <p>At a press conference in 1999, Intel spent 40 minutes explaining how it was going to bake serial numbers into its Pentium III chips (which would have meant that every computer user could be identified). Jack and another journalist, Guy Kewney, left the spokesman speechless with some pertinent questions. The policy was dropped in the next version.</p> <p>One of the few areas Jack was slow to move into was mobile phones. He persevered with his trusty Nokia for a surprisingly long time. Perhaps it went with the pipe he loved to smoke. Iain Thomson, US news editor of the Register, recalled how Jack\u2019s use of his beloved pipe was legendary. \u201cIf Jack was cleaning it in a presentation he was either bored or irritated. If he put his pipe into his pocket and drew a deep breath it was the equivalent of a Western gunslinger draining his whisky and unclipping the strap on his holster.\u201d</p> <p>Another seeming anomaly, known among his peers as \u201cthe Schofield enigma\u201d, was Jack\u2019s hostility to Apple and its products. He rarely mentioned them in his writings and hardly used the work Mac computer that was issued to him. It was partly because he was wedded to his deep knowledge of Microsoft and its ecosystem and partly because he thought Apple was too controlling.</p> <p>Charles Arthur, a fellow Guardian computer editor, said: \u201cJack had a utilitarian view of IT, perhaps because he\u2019d seen it from the wires-and-transistors era; he didn\u2019t understand why people would pay extra for something that he didn\u2019t perceive as having value, ie, the user experience.\u201d</p> <p>However, Jack was always ready to help anyone who had a problem with their computer, a practice that became institutionalised with the Ask Jack column from 2000. The last two questions he answered were: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-at-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating\" title=\"\">\u201cWhat do I need to work from home due to coronavirus?\u201d</a> and, last week, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best tablet for video-calling grandma?\u201d</p> <p>Born in Barnsley, West Yorkshire, Jack was the son of Joseph and Cynthia Schofield. He was educated at Belle Vue boys grammar school in Bradford. While in later life Jack was inescapably associated with computers, he was actually an English scholar, gaining a BA at Birmingham University in English literature in 1969 before doing a master\u2019s in English at the University of British Columbia, Canada.</p> <p>His first passion was photography, and on return to the UK he moved to London, editing various photography magazines including Zoom and Photo Technique, and writing books such as The Darkroom Book (1981), and Photographing People (1982).</p> <p>In 1985 The Guardian Guide to Microcomputing, a selection of his columns, rewritten and revised, was published, and in 1996 he co-authored, with Wendy Grossman and David Goul, The Hutchinson Dictionary of Computing, Multimedia and the Internet. He also wrote for numerous websites including ZDNet and Reuters as well as being a frequent broadcaster with the BBC.

Because of our reduced circumstances, it has become something to anticipate on about the same level as that half-pint of Carlsberg that John Mills sinks at the end of Ice Cold In Alex, but it cannot hope to be as satisfying, for all that an immense amount of work has clearly gone in to making it look convincing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/cheltenham-faces-criticism-after-racegoers-suffer-covid-19-symptoms\">Cheltenham faces criticism after racegoers suffer Covid-19 symptoms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first odd thing is the runners list. In a normal year, the virtual race would be based around the entries made on the Monday before the National. But the race was abandoned weeks ago and the most recent entry stage that actually happened was at the end of February. So the producers have evidently decided to take the top 40 horses left in at that stage and accept them as the runners.</p> <p>In reality, a lot of the top 40 would have dropped out by this stage. Joe Farrell, who got a run in last year\u2019s National, was 71st on the list at the end of February. It would have taken some nerve to go through the list, ejecting horses that might not have turned up at Aintree, and you always risk offending someone, but it would have been worth doing.</p> <p>Someone has worked very hard on the jockey bookings but I raise an eyebrow at the appearance of Rachael Blackmore on Burrows Saint. She won a hurdles race on him at New Year when Paul Townend was on a more fancied runner from the Willie Mullins yard but Townend would still have had first choice and he surely would not have rejected last year\u2019s Irish National winner in favour of Total Recall, whose odds are three times bigger.

They might be right, too, because the three virtual Nationals so far have all fallen to fancied horses at 14-1 or shorter.</p> <p>Would Lisa O\u2019Neill be on Shattered Love if Jamie Codd had no ride in the race? I doubt it. David Maxwell probably would have insisted on riding his Saint Xavier, but there\u2019s no way he\u2019d have made the weight of 10st 4lb. When he had to do 10st 7lb last season, he <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-turf-22-november-2018\">threatened to eat the horse in question</a> afterwards. I\u2019m afraid we have to put him down for 3lb overweight, or he\u2019d be so light-headed that he might not make it across the first Melling Road.</p> <p>The virtual going description is reportedly \u2018good\u2019, which is slightly surprising, given that the policy at Aintree seems to be to ensure good to soft or softer. The new clerk at Aintree, Sulekha Varma, tells me it would probably have been good to soft this week, though some watering might have been necessary.</p> <p>With all that in mind, I\u2019m going to have a crack at working out what would have happened in this year\u2019s Grand National, had it taken place this weekend.</p> <h2>3pm UPDATE</h2> <p>I wouldn\u2019t say this is a tip for the Virtual National, because who knows what kind of outcome a computer is going to spit out, but I\u2019ll claim the win if it comes up with the same answer as me \u2026</p> <p>1st <strong>Any Second Now</strong> 10-1<br>2nd <strong>Burrows Saint</strong> 12-1<br>3rd <strong>Jett </strong>50-1<br>4th <strong>Kildisart </strong>50-1</p> <p>The 2020 Grand National was chiefly memorable for the chance taken by Tiger Roll at The Chair, which drew gasps from the crowd and may, on reflection, have ended his chance of a third consecutive victory. The little horse has been a bit low at a handful of these fences in the past couple of years and got away with it but this mistake cost him momentum and rocked Davy Russell onto his neck briefly. He seemed to make a good recovery and travelled well on the run to Becher\u2019s but found the leaders getting away from him after that.</p> <p>By then, it was clear that Any Second Now had plenty left in the tank as the Kim Muir Chase winner at last year\u2019s Cheltenham Festival cruised along behind Bristol De Mai, who ran so gallantly in the lead for such a long way under his big weight. Nigel Twiston-Davies\u2019s popular grey was left behind by a small group of mostly Irish-trained horses from the home turn.</p> <p>Briefly it looked as though Burrows Saint could follow up his Irish National win of last year and become the first seven-year-old to land the Aintree spectacular since 1940. But when Mark Walsh let out an inch of rein on the approach to the final fence, Any Second Now quickened clear. He is a second winner of the race for his trainer, Ted Walsh.</p> <p>Jett stayed on dourly to be another placed runner for Jessie Harrington, who had the runner-up last year with her first National runner, Magic Of Light. Having been sold just a fortnight ago, Jett was ridden by the amateur Sam Waley-Cohen, who has such a fine record when riding over these fences.</p> <p>Kildisart did best of the Brits, staying on well in a never-dangerous fourth, with Tiger Roll cheered for shouldering top weight into fifth place. Bristol De Mai faded after putting so much into the first half of the race but completed the course, and similarly game efforts were made by OK Corral, Acapella Bourgeois, Walk In The Mill and Sub Lieutenant.</p> <p>But the ground was just not soft enough for some of the fancied horses, like Kimberlite Candy and Potters Corner, who struggled to get involved. Total Recall came here off the back of a Thyestes success but ran no race, just as was the case when he started favourite two years ago. It is hard to escape the conclusion that he just doesn\u2019t care for the place.</p> <p>So Irish runners have mopped up the first three places for the third year in a row and the colours of JP McManus have been successful for just the second time in the National, following Don\u2019t Push It a decade ago. Is that how you saw it panning out?</p>",
  "<p>I became obsessed with the 1984 film The NeverEnding Story through the power of scrapbooking. Despite missing this meta-textual fairytale when it was released, someone in my family home had clipped out the black-and-white production stills presumably intended to jazz up the entertainment listings of our local paper. I then Pritt Sticked these contextless images into my jumbo movie scrapbook, which ended up being a NeverEnding Story fanzine because I never added anything else to it.</p> <p>I revered that tatty book. As the 1980s crawled onward in the sedate and rather culturally remote Scottish Borders where I grew up, I would periodically pore over these snapshots from an unknown fantasy world. They depicted a rock monster with a jutting Desperate Dan chin, a dapper adventurer in a top hat petting a giant snail and a wizened man with elven ears. This was the height of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/13/no-more-nerds-how-dungeons-dragons-became-cool-stranger-things-game-of-thrones\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> mania, so it seemed reasonable to assume that this mismatched band would embark on a quest to retrieve the magical cauldron or whatever.</p> <p>Does this not ring any bells? Perhaps the overworked journalist who assembled those listings back in the day hadn\u2019t seen The NeverEnding Story, either. Certainly none of the images featured Bastian or Atreyo, the boyish heroes of the piece, nor Falkor, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdLc9Fz4dI\">the giant dog-faced draught</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdLc9Fz4dI\"> excluder</a> who swoops in to save them at vital moments. When I finally saw the film a few years later, it was a discombobulating experience. The plot, where the modern-day Bastian discovers his destiny is entwined with the fantasy book he is reading, was far removed from the story I had imagined.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeFni9dOv7c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UeFni9dOv7c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The NeverEnding Story has remained a personally memorable outlier in a crammed 1980s fantasy film canon that includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/how-labyrinth-led-me-to-david-bowie\">Labyrinth</a>, Willow and the heroically naff Krull. Viewed from 2020, that magnificent cluster looks like the last starburst of pre-CGI practical magic, where allegorical realms were ingeniously magicked up from matte paintings, physical puppetry and the judicious deployment of dry ice. The NeverEnding Story even boasted a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2WN0T-Ee3q4\">title track synth-pop banger co-written by </a><a href=\"https://youtu.be/2WN0T-Ee3q4\">Giorgio Moroder</a>, a tinkly but potent earworm with a M\u00f6bius strip chorus that still feels as if it could loop back on itself for ever.</p> <p>So it felt a little weird to cue up the film on Netflix and revisit this dusty wing of my mind palace, albeit with a deeper appreciation of Moroder and armed with the knowledge that director Wolfgang Petersen was coming to this family-friendly project fresh off Das Boot. Turns out, The NeverEnding Story is still a florid but uneven quest, dense with lore about the world of Fantasia harvested from the source material \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/apr/01/review-neverending-story-michael-ende\">a bestselling children\u2019s book</a> by the German author Michael Ende \u2013 but confusingly framed by modern-day scenes of the bullied Bastian, who spends most of the time hiding out in his school\u2019s dusty attic hunched over his precious book.</p> <p>Now, as then, I wish I had that actual tome: it looks like the sort of fantasy doorstop that would have a detailed map of the lands of Fantasia in its endpapers, so it would be easier to figure out how the royal Ivory Tower geographically relates to the Desert of Shattered Hopes and the Swamps of Sadness. The fantastical characters I had fixated on all those years ago are still merely bit players: emissaries from the various compass points of Fantasia, comparable to the motley background patrons of the Mos Eisley cantina in Star Wars. (Although this time round it clicked that the dapper dude dressed like Willy Wonka is played by Deep Roy, who would go on to appear as multiple munchkins in Tim Burton films.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1c00f38c20838705be2f4884aa1f2733d41322e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c00f38c20838705be2f4884aa1f2733d41322e/0_93_1692_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barret Oliver in The NeverEnding Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barret Oliver as Bastian in The NeverEnding Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Constantin FILM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The intervening years have not been kind to The NeverEnding Story. It feels like a grab-bag of well-worn ideas and obstacles as Atreyo tackles a fantasy-trope assault course in search of the higher learning that will defeat amorphous baddie the Nothing, a broiling black cloud apparently fuelled by apathy in the real world. Spoiler: in the end, Atreyo needs the fourth-wall-breaking help of Bastian himself.</p> <p>If it catches you in the right frame of mind, it might resonate as a metaphor about the hallowed power of stories. Watch it in snark mode and it feels like an overstretched Crystal Maze episode. Yet for all the dubbed dialogue, variable acting and wonky effects, it still contains one genuinely shattering sequence. The plucky warrior-teen Atreyo is leading his magnificent white stallion Artax through the Swamps of Sadness in search of an oracle. Under Fantasia\u2019s fairytale rules, this fetid slurry can claim any traveller who surrenders to its miasma of depression.</p> <p>For whatever reason, Artax gives up and begins to slowly sink into the peaty murk while an increasingly frantic Atreyo looks on. In an otherwise goofy fable, it is an emotionally scourging scene that seems to take forever. The previously dauntless Atreyo is inconsolable; his huddled reader-companion Bastian is in bits. And if the viewer isn\u2019t a little teary too, then the Nothing has already won. You may as well watch Krull instead.</p>",

That\u2019s why we need to rebuild our society post-Covid-19 not with another decade of austerity, but with a decade-long programme of intensive investment in our social and physical infrastructure to end our dependency on fossil fuels once and for all, and construct a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">green economy</a>, sharing the wealth and quality of life that it engenders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/un-secretary-general-coronavirus-crisis-world-pandemic-response\">UN secretary general: recovery from the coronavirus crisis must lead to a better world | Ant\u00f3nio Guterres</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We pay for it by introducing an immediate windfall tax on the banks and finance sector that we bailed out when they brought about the crisis more than a decade ago.

  "<p>My kitchen has never been busier. I\u2019m cooking for five, as well as testing recipes for my next few columns, making bread and whipping up the occasional cake to keep spirits high. Cooking has been something to focus on, something I can do to help keep my mind quiet; its results keep us well and cheer us through these wild times.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been sitting together as a family for three meals a day, which is two more than usual. And it\u2019s happening all over the country: we are going to come out of this better cooks.

We waste less, think more, and value food in a completely different way, for the precious life-giving stuff it is.</p> <p>Here are the recipes I\u2019ve been making for my family these past weeks. They are simple things that use the lottery of produce that arrives in our veg box, also what\u2019s in my spice rack, dry store and freezer.

  "<p>Covid-19 has been living in my apartment for the past 15 days. It falls asleep inches from my head and wakes up beside me. I breathe its breath. I\u2019ve always been reluctant to call my apartment \u201chome\u201d here in Catania. Over the past 10 years I\u2019ve traversed the Middle East, photographing cities, their inhabitants and the conflicts that have ravaged that area of the world for decades. The streets of Baghdad, Mosul, Kabul, Amman, Khartoum and Tehran have been my home. I\u2019d always considered those 50 sq metres in Catania as a pied-\u00e0-terre, a place to keep my clothes and my photo archive. I never could have imagined that after documenting the desperation of refugee camps in Iraq or mass graves in Sinjar, or aboard an ambulance collecting the dead among the Kurdish resistance in northern Syria, that I\u2019d have to confront the world\u2019s biggest story in my own small apartment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"013358068349116724bfd14532b75aa4a9b5e107\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/013358068349116724bfd14532b75aa4a9b5e107/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographing the empty streets from the window.

My mother, my partner, the war reporter Marta Bellingreri, and other people close to me have been infected, but somehow I have been spared. I interpreted this peculiar twist as if Covid-19 had chosen me to photograph it from a different perspective. And I met the challenge, also because the reasons that brought the virus into my apartment are also extraordinarily tied to my career as a photographer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"92d0d8a6a9b6e50c372f87b5c7938da6faa71d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92d0d8a6a9b6e50c372f87b5c7938da6faa71d6e/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The street where Alessio and Marta live at sunset with very few people walking due to the government measures to respond to the pandemic emergency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The street where Alessio and Marta live, at sunset with very few people walking due to the government measures to respond to the pandemic emergency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The street where Alessio and Marta live, pictured at sunset.</p></li> </ul> <p>Last 25 February I hosted some friends and family members for a celebratory dinner. <a href=\"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/\">World Press Photo</a> had just announced the 2020 winners, and, for the second time, I was selected, for my photograph of <a href=\"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39627/1/Alessio-Mamo\">an I</a><a href=\"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39627/1/Alessio-Mamo\">sis bride embracing her child in the prison camp of Al-Hol</a>, north-east Syria.

No one could have imagined that Sicily\u2019s patient zero was at that dinner table, a friend who had returned from Germany. He had no idea he was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. I left the day after for Khartoum with Marta to photograph a country in the throes of revolution for over a year.</p> <p>The call that changed that trip and the following weeks came six days later, in early March, as Italy and the world were changing for the worse. My friend who had been in Germany had tested positive for Covid-19. The alarm was sounded: phone calls to notify those who may have been infected and tests for the older adults who were at the dinner. Some of my family members tested positive, and my mother was taken immediately to an hospital. She\u2019s 69 and has suffered from respiratory illness in the past. Her life was at risk and my world caved in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e121b766782d68f424c44e7ea5553b63024c58a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e121b766782d68f424c44e7ea5553b63024c58a3/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marta at the window while drinking a herbal tea.

In order to receive it, services will be prohibited from charging families a fee \u2013 including an out-of-pocket or gap fee \u2013 and must stay open unless forced to shut on public health advice.</p> <p>Centres have been told to prioritise care to essential workers, vulnerable and disadvantaged children and previously enrolled children. Parents who maintain enrolments but choose to keep their children home for the duration of the pandemic will not have to pay fees and will still have a place afterwards, the government says.</p> <p>The education department <a href=\"https://www.dese.gov.au/covid-19/childcare/childcare-faq\">has clarified that</a> the new weekly payments to services will be about 50% of their recent fee revenue or 50% of the existing hourly childcare subsidy rate cap, \u201cwhichever is lower\u201d.</p> <p>The owner of a long day care centre in NSW \u2013 who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue for educators and parents \u2013 said this meant that their revenue would drop by nearly two-thirds overnight.</p> <p>\u201cI can sustain some losses for a short period of time ... but for how long? It was all taken away overnight,\u201d the owner told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>One issue is uncertainty over the eligibility of workers for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">the jobkeeper wage subsidy</a> of $1,500 per person per fortnight, which the government has promoted as a way to supplement the other childcare funding.</p> <p>Some educators are on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/left-with-nothing-australias-migrant-workforce-face-destitution-without-coronavirus-safety-net\">temporary work visas</a> which means they cannot access the wages subsidy.

There were a lot of tears. It was very emotional. There were a lot of scared people.\u201d</p> <p>Hewitson said she had explained the service\u2019s financial challenges to its families, some of whom had offered to keep making payments. However, under the government\u2019s conditions for the new funding, services are prohibited from charging any fees.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I would really like to happen from here is for the services to be able to apply for the jobkeeper payment on behalf of any educators and for every educator to be eligible to get it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I would like the families, if they were to volunteer to make payments, as so many have offered, even begged me, that we would be allowed to accept them to supplement the educators\u2019 income.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Paterson, the chief executive officer of Family Day Care Australia, a peak body, said he was hopeful that the vast majority of family day care educators would be eligible for the jobkeeper payment.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some specific nuances around the issue of ABNs but we\u2019ve asked the department to work with us in finding a solution to that problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Goodstart Early Learning, the nation\u2019s largest childcare provider with 665 centres, remained in talks with the government about its eligibility for the jobkeeper scheme, which sets a higher bar for big organisations.</p> <p>A spokesperson said Goodstart was yet to receive confirmation \u201cbut thank the minister and the treasurer for working with us to help find a solution\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government's coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labor\u2019s early childhood education spokesperson, Amanda Rishworth, said the government \u201cmust provide some clarity and ensure the new system does not threaten the viability of centres and potentially force them to shut their doors\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian Tax Office commissioner will be allowed to exercise discretion in dealing with \u201cunique cases\u201d under the jobkeeper scheme, the government says.</p> <p>Childcare services may also be able to access payments of greater than the new 50% rate in exceptional circumstances \u201csuch as where greater funding is required due to an increase in enrolments to meet demand to address the needs of essential workers or vulnerable children\u201d.</p> <p>The education minister, Dan Tehan, told the ABC the government was \u201cdoing everything we can to put in place new arrangements which mean that as many centres can stay open as they possibly can, and as many workers will keep their jobs\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>It was around 1 a.m. on Thursday when officer Jason Brown from the Albuquerque police department responded to a single gunshot on 3rd St and Central Avenue. The officer arrived to find Jon Jones seated in a black Jeep with the engine running, a near-empty bottle of mezcal on the floor behind the passenger\u2019s seat and a handgun under the driver\u2019s seat.</p> <p>According to Brown\u2019s <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jon-jones-arrest-statement-2020.pdf\">report</a>, Jones had a \u201cgreen leafy substance on his shirt and pants, consistent with marijuana\u201d and a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol coming from his facial area\u201d. He performed poorly on three field sobriety tests and his breathalyzer tests showed him \u201cat or above twice the legal limit.\u201d He was searched and <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jon-jones-arrest-statement-2020.pdf\">arrested on four different counts</a>, including aggravated DWI, negligent use of a firearm, possession of open container, and no proof of insurance in vehicle.</p> <p>This is far from the first time that the Jones has been in trouble with the law. The UFC champion was charged with a DWI in 2012 after smashing his Bentley into a utility pole in New York. Then, in April 2015, Jones was involved in a felony hit-and-run where he fled the scene after hitting a pregnant woman\u2019s car. The woman had sustained injuries from the accident, but, according to witnesses, Jones fled the scene after shoving cash in his pockets. Despite facing 18 months in jail for the felony, Jones avoided jail time and instead received 18 months of supervised probation.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Jones, his problems did not end there. While on probation for his felony charge in 2016, Jones was stopped in Albuquerque and given five tickets, including one for drag racing. The well-documented incident was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6yFu5ZD32c\">captured on body cam footage</a>.</p> <p>Then, in October 2019, Jones took a <a href=\"https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/10/ufc-jon-jones-plea-deal-in-strip-club-case-new-mexico\">plea deal</a> after pleading no contest to disorderly conduct in an incident with a cocktail waitress at a strip club. He had originally pleaded not guilty to a charge of battery after <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ufc-jon-jones-police-report-strip-club-incident-redacted.jpg\">being accused</a> of kissing and choking the waitress before slapping her in the genital region.</p> <p>Beyond his string of arrests and concerning legal incidents, Jones has also failed two separate drug tests administered by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which facilitates testing for the UFC. He was suspended on both occasions.</p> <p>However, Jones\u2019s latest incident raises some concerning alarms regarding the UFC champion\u2019s mental health. In the body cam footage distributed by the Bernalillo County district attorney, Jones appeared to be distraught and revealed that he was \u201cscared for his family\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have anxiety. I have anxiety,\u201d Jones repeated while the officer appeared to cuff him. \u201cWould you guys just allow me to take off my hoodie? Please?\u2026Please, please, because my anxiety gets so bad\u2026\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aIZXI5vfsM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6aIZXI5vfsM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The candid footage allows viewers a peak behind the curtain at Jones distressed state, his apparent intoxication, and some of the underlying familial and mental health issues that may be plaguing him. It is also the latest example of Jones\u2019s downward trajectory \u2013 a spiral that encapsulates every aspect of his life outside of the UFC octagon, where he remains champion.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Jones pleaded guilty to a DWI and will avoid jail time as long as he follows the terms of a plea agreement. According to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/28978665/jon-jones-agrees-plea-deal-dwi-charge-new-mexico\">agreement</a>, Jones will serve 96 consecutive hours in a county Community Custody Program, complete 48 hours of community service, pay a $500 fine, and will remain on supervised probation for a year. He will also wear an ankle bracelet that will track his movements. All the other charges against him, including negligent use of a firearm and possession of an open container of alcohol, were dropped.</p> <p>Afterwards, Jones released a public<a href=\"https://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/1245122692560420869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https://www.sportbible.com/ufc/mma-news-jon-jones-makes-emotional-first-statement-following-last-weeks-arrest-20200401\"> statement</a>, where he admitted to an \u201cunhealthy relationship with alcohol\u201d:</p> <p>\u201cWhile we all work to understand and cope with stress and uncertainties surrounding the current state of our world, I want to express how truly disappointed I am that I have become the source of a negative headline again, especially during these trying times,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI am disappointed for letting down the people I care about the most - my family, friends and my fans. This morning I entered into a plea deal with the Albuquerque DA\u2019s office. I accept full responsibility for my actions, and I know that I have some personal work to do to which involves the unhealthy relationship I have with alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Jones\u2019s admission and the concerning footage, it remains unclear whether Jones will receive the help he needs from either the legal system or the organization that employs him. While <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/26/21195774/most-stupid-athlete-ever-fighters-react-to-jon-jones-dwi-and-negligent-use-of-firearm-charges\">several fighters have openly criticized and mocked Jones</a> following his latest run-in with the law, the champion\u2019s bitter rival, Daniel Cormier, did not see this as a cause for celebration, instead imploring the UFC to get involved to help Jones.</p> <p>\u201cI think the UFC needs to save him,\u201d Cormier told <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28972781/daniel-cormier-ufc-needs-take-measures-help-jon-jones\">ESPN</a>. \u201cKeep him, but then really try to help him try to get better.\u201d</p> <p>While the UFC has stripped Jones of his light heavyweight title in the past, it was not always due to his legal troubles. Jones was first stripped of the title in 2015 following the felony hit-and-run charge. Then, in 2016, Jones was stripped of the interim title after failing a pre-fight drug test in connection with his title unification bout scheduled for UFC 200. In September 2017, Jones was stripped for a third time after he tested positive for the banned steroid turinabol.</p> <p>When Jones was stripped of the interim title in 2016, UFC president Dana White revealed that he would \u201cnever take the risk of headlining a show with Jon Jones again\u201d. Since then, Jones has headlined five separate events, including as recently as UFC 247 in February 2020. Given how quickly White reconsidered his ruling on Jones, and the UFC limited action with regards to Jones\u2019s legal trouble, it is unlikely that the promotion will take any action against the UFC champion for his latest infraction.</p> <p>It is evidently clear that the 32-year-old fighter is in need of help for his potential mental health issues and substance abuse. And while the NHL has a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarBombBoom13/status/1051910130898329601?s=20\">player assistance program</a> and the NFL has an <a href=\"https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/PDFs/Agents/2016SOAPolicy_v2.pdf\">intervention program</a>, the UFC does not appear to have such a program in place. Yet given that the greatest fighter in a generation is in dire need of some serious help, it might be time for the UFC to implement such a program.</p>",
  "<p>David Farrier\u2019s idea in this book is to try and imagine our present moment of climate and ecological crisis from a far-distant future. What fossil traces will post-industrial human civilisation leave behind for the future to find? Roads and vast cities, long abandoned and forgotten, will show up as layers in the geological strata; our buried radioactive waste will still be deadly; our throwaway plastic will persist until eventually \u201cover the coming millennia, hydrocarbons leach from the fossil plastic, accumulating in small deposits and setting in motion a slow chemical return\u201d to its origins as oil. Future archaeologists may comment on the dreary sameness of our collective biomass: almost all of it <em>Homo sapiens</em>, along with the few species we like to eat. Which future archaeologists would those be, by the way? Sometimes Farrier is addressing human generations to come; at other times he\u2019s thinking on timescales longer than any species is likely to last, let alone ours with its over-sophistication and bad habits. One microbiologist fantasises that some day a \u201ccommune of evolved bees\u201d will encourage bee-scientists to study the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\" title=\"\">Anthropocene</a> as \u201ca warning for all hive-kind\u201d.</p> <p>The transience of what appears indestructible has been a rich theme in poetry and story. The mists shift on a bleak hillside in Kurosawa\u2019s <em>Throne of Blood</em>, where bloody Cobweb Castle is visible, now vanished and forgotten; Saxons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/03/poster-poems-ruins\" title=\"\">write poems</a> about stumbling on the ruins of Roman Aquae Sulis; Batman chases villains round the fallen grandeur of Gotham City. Farrier\u2019s argument is nuanced slightly differently, channelling our contemporary angst. It\u2019s not only that our way of life is transient. Our heedless interventions in the life of the planet \u2013 herding, ploughing, planting, building, mining, smelting, processing, communicating \u2013 have degraded its complexity and beauty in ways that will long outlast us, leaving their ineradicable taint. \u201cWe live in the shadow of an eclipse that will endure perhaps as many as ten million years before sound, shape and colour return in full to the land and the oceans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An uninitiated eye can only glide over Farrier\u2019s summaries, adding them on to the mounting heap of glum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The climate and ecological crisis hurts us: and not only materially, physically. It hurts in the imagination, in the stories we tell. An idea of nature\u2019s boundlessness, the recurring seasons, the ocean\u2019s endless renewal \u2013 vaster than we are and cruelly, consolingly indifferent to us \u2013 has salved our private and public despairs, perhaps often almost unconsciously, through plagues and floods and wars, tragic ending after tragic ending. I remember the happiness I felt when we were shown black and white slides, in school, of the equatorial forest \u2013 much too long ago for any warning that it was threatened. My happiness didn\u2019t make me want to go there; I just needed it to be there. Nature holds together our sense of being, organically, at the root; and it\u2019s therefore in the roots of our language. We didn\u2019t know how fundamental our trust was in \u201cthe treasure of nature\u2019s germens\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s Macbeth invoking chaos \u2013 until news came that the treasure after all couldn\u2019t be counted on.</p> <p>And therefore the language and style in which we address the crisis are all-important. Obviously there\u2019s a first responsibility for the words to produce effects: an urgent need to change minds, change governance, change practices. And then alongside that there\u2019s the other responsibility that words have: to put up their supple resistance to stupidity and ugliness and evil, so that our consciousness of what\u2019s at hand has form, and we can bear it. There\u2019s a fascinating chapter in Farrier\u2019s book on two contrasting approaches to burying nuclear waste. How can we warn the far future not to dig where we\u2019ve put it, when we know that the future won\u2019t understand our language?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b019deec76055d2abb759e68a2555c1dd123f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b019deec76055d2abb759e68a2555c1dd123f6/0_276_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olkiluoto nuclear power plant \u2026 the world\u2019s first underground repository for highly radioactive nuclear waste, on the island of Eurajoki, western Finland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olkiluoto nuclear power plant \u2026 the world\u2019s first underground repository for highly radioactive nuclear waste, on the island of Eurajoki, western Finland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Kingsley/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Near Carlsbad, New Mexico, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant has devised a scheme that sounds like a computer game: \u201cFive levels of warning messages, rising in complexity, and a mix of monoliths, buried clues and archives \u2026 accompanied by faces of disgust and repulsion, modelled on Edvard Munch\u2019s <em>The Scream</em> \u2026 A thirty foot earthen berm, studded with magnets and radar reflectors to signal an anomaly, will enclose the inner ring of granite markers.\u201d In Finland meanwhile, they\u2019ve decided that \u201cgiven the long lifespan\u201d of their nuclear waste repository on Olkiluoto island \u2013 it will probably be buried at some point under another ice age \u2013 \u201cit would be foolish to try to mark it\u201d. They will \u201cbury the waste in specially designed copper canisters; backfill the hole; and retreat, without leaving a single trace aboveground\u201d; it\u2019s meant to be forgotten. This difference, too, feels like a choice about language; it\u2019s aesthetic as well as practical. Only one of those options is in good taste.</p> <p>Farrier\u2019s book is full of fascinating things, yet doesn\u2019t in its totality work for me. Its central conceit, to begin with \u2013 that idea of viewing, in some unimaginably distant future, the fossils left behind by our Anthropocene \u2013 feels strained because such a future is indeed impossible to imagine. The very terms of our love for our planet will no doubt turn out in deep time to be so much stardust \u2013 or carbon, or whatever; we can\u2019t begin to know in what ways our depredations might matter, on the timescale proposed here. No doubt Farrier wants the future-fossil idea to work as a rhetorical device, reminding us of the sheer size of our disaster now; but the harder he works to conjure the geological scale of the problem, the more tempting it is for his language to become vatic and sententious. \u201cFragments of artificial glass will be glazed with cataracts, like glaucomatous eyes staring blindly into the dark.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/30/best-science-nature-and-ideas-books-of-2019\">Best science, nature and ideas books of 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farrier\u2019s a literary critic and not a scientist, and the book is intended for a lay readership; but there just isn\u2019t room here to begin to lay out the complexities of these diverse scientific disciplines. A reader might finish his chapter on jellyfish convinced that they\u2019re taking over the sea (\u201cthe ocean\u2019s one lonely god will be frilled and eyeless, drifting placidly and implacably through its vast, empty dominion\u201d), but ocean scientist Juli Berwald, in her book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/jellyfish-personal-empowerment-and-saving-the-planet\" title=\"\">Spineless</a></em>, resists any certainty even as to whether jellyfish numbers are on the rise. Each \u201cecosystem in the ocean\u201d, she writes, \u201chas its own unique characteristics, with distinctive vulnerabilities, threats, and resiliences\u201d. A reader can\u2019t conceivably do justice to the chunks of science in <em>Footprints</em>: the account of lateral gene-swap transfer, for instance, or palaeoclimatologists\u2019 varying theses of the rhythms of ice ages. An uninitiated eye can only glide over Farrier\u2019s summaries, taking what\u2019s there on trust and adding it on to the mounting heap of glum. \u201cThe shadows are racing onwards \u2026 life is collapsing into darkness and silence.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t plenty to be glum about: glum, anxious, desperate even. We have to hope to turn this stinking, filthy tanker of our civilisation around: do something globally, for the first time ever, for our collective good. Not easy. And things won\u2019t ever all be all right again anyway, or all pristine, even at the best \u2013 they never were. Nature itself isn\u2019t pristine, that\u2019s a fallacy that belongs with the dream of original sin.

  "<p>We are in the third week of school closures and general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/manhattan-streets-empty-as-new-york-city-goes-into-coronavirus-lockdown-video\">lock</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/manhattan-streets-empty-as-new-york-city-goes-into-coronavirus-lockdown-video\">down in New York</a> and I keep thinking of the movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/30/home-alone-review-yuletide-rerelease\">Home Alone</a>. Famously in that film, Kevin went wild for his first few days off the grid, eating ice-cream for dinner and jumping on the furniture. After that, he tidied up and discovered that order and structure are the only way to live. When his mum came home at the end of the movie, he had reached a state of wisdom.</p> <p>The trajectory from school\u2019s out abandonment to set routine held true for the first two weeks at home. Now we\u2019re in a new phase \u2013 one not covered by the three-act structure. If this pandemic has exposed anything, it\u2019s how arbitrary many of the things we take for granted really are, including the way we organise our time. We dossed about, we knuckled down, and then this week we hit a wall. \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d said my kids when I set up the equipment for home-school lessons. I had no real desire to make them. We are unravelling and resetting, again.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just school. For those lucky enough to be healthy and have jobs, the mood veers wildly between anxiety and optimism. Several female friends report unwanted erotic dreams about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/new-york-coronavirus-cuomo-us-new-normal\">Andrew Cuomo</a>, the governor of New York and very much man of the hour. (It begs an unthinkable analogy with Rudi Giuliani after 9/11.) We are all working on our time management skills, while realising that the only really valuable time management tool is a wife to watch the kids.</p> <p>Outside the house, meanwhile, things get stranger. So far, neighbourliness still reigns; within our own networks, there\u2019s a sense of solidarity. But there is an increasingly odd dynamic in public. In the supermarket, we glare at each other for passing too close. Hostility lurks near the surface. In the laundry room, someone stands three inches from me while loading the drier above mine. \u201cHey,\u201d I snap. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says. It\u2019s all very awkward.</p> <p>During the middle of the week, news reports say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is about to recommend everyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/apr/01/us-coronavirus-news-donald-trump-white-house-live-latest?page=with:block-5e84ab158f087564da1e3d94\">wear a mask</a> outside the house. It\u2019s impossible to get one on Amazon and so we walk to a weird toy store in my neighbourhood, still open via a loophole that classifies sellers of \u201coffice supplies\u201d as essential businesses, that is rumoured to have masks. The entrance is shuttered, but like something from a bad dystopian movie, after we\u2019ve milled about on the sidewalk for a minute, someone sees us and opens the grille half way. We duck in. It\u2019s a maximum of six masks per person, for $60 \u2013 10 times what it should cost \u2013 and I\u2019m only too happy to pay.</p> <p>At 7pm that night, we go out on our terrace and clap for the hospital workers. People bang pots and pans. There is universal cheering. I had wondered if the novelty of this would wear off, too, diminishing through gratitude fatigue. But it hasn\u2019t. The cheering, perhaps the real barometer of the city\u2019s mood, is different from one day to the next. It keeps getting louder.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>When the overcrowded, long-distance bus from Johannesburg arrived at the Malawian border post of Mwanza last week, one passenger was dead. Fearing he had picked up Covid-19 in South Africa and infected all his fellow travellers, the guards sent everyone to a hastily built quarantine centre for 14 days.</p> <p>The man had died of other causes but Malawi, which is well used to devastating diseases like HIV and Aids, cholera and malaria, is taking no chances. Along with S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Comoros, South Sudan and Burundi in Africa, it is one of the last <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200329-sitrep-69-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=8d6620fa_4\">countries in the world</a> not to have confirmed a single Covid-19 case yet.</p> <p>In Malawi only 20 people a day can be tested for the virus, and there are just 25 intensive care unit beds and seven ventilators in the country of more than 18 million people. Since February, however, the government has been racing to curb Covid\u2019s arrival.</p> <p>It has wheeled out a \u00a324m preparedness plan, suspended international flights, banned weddings and gatherings of more than 100 people, closed schools and universities, and is making anyone arriving from Europe, China, or the US self-isolate. According to the ministry of health, 4,603 people who have entered the country in the past few weeks are \u201cunder surveillance\u201d.</p> <p>As an extra precaution, Malawi\u2019s president, Peter Mutharika, has reduced the number of people he meets to 10-20 a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have been told to regularly wash hands using soap or alcohol sanitiser. But because there have been no confirmed cases, people are not yet too frightened. Business is going on as usual, people are still making huge gatherings at some places like markets,\u201d says Blantyre accountant James Gomani.</p> <p>While warnings about Covid-19 are widely heard in jingles and public health announcements in cities like Blantyre and Lilongwe, they have barely reached the remote rural areas where nearly 90% of Malawi\u2019s population live and farm, and few people have access to TV, radio or electricity, says Patrick Kamzitu, a heath worker in Nambuma.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Covid-19 gets in, it will spread rapidly across the country and many people will die.

If it does, it will overwhelm us, and be worse than cholera, which we had badly in 2013, and hunger in 2002. People will die in large numbers,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Kamzitu cycles from village to village warning of what may come and telling people to take precautions, but rural health centres have few drugs. Many people don\u2019t even have soap or running water and are already weakened with malaria, HIV or tuberculosis.</p> <p>Malawi has plenty of experience of handling contagious diseases but is barely prepared for a disease that can spread so fast, says Oxfam\u2019s international head of inequality policy, Max Lawson, a former resident of Malawi who is now based in Nairobi.</p> <p>\u201cIf Covid-19 gets in, it will spread rapidly across the country and many people will die. The health system is very weak and poorly resourced. The population is young, which may be in Malawi\u2019s favour with a disease like Covid-19, but there is a lot of untested TB and HIV in the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK government and other donors have not been supporting Malawi like they used to. They should immediately suspend the country\u2019s debt payments. It would cost very little and help a lot. As it is, Malawi will be hit very badly economically by Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>Health professionals fear it is only a matter of time before the pandemic reaches Malawi. \u201cIt has only been in the past few weeks that it has been spreading across Africa. So most people feel it will get here at some point. We may not be 100% ready but government is gearing up,\u201d says Dr Bridget Malewezi of the Society of Medical Doctors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/28/malawi-legalises-cannabis-amid-hopes-of-fresh-economic-growth\">Malawi legalises cannabis amid hopes of fresh economic growth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Africa has <a href=\"https://africanarguments.org/2020/03/31/coronavirus-in-africa-tracker-how-many-cases-and-where-latest/\">confirmed only </a><a href=\"https://africanarguments.org/2020/03/31/coronavirus-in-africa-tracker-how-many-cases-and-where-latest/\">6,473 cases</a>, many of which were brought into the continent by people working in China or Italy.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Friday 3 April.</p> <h2>Single-digit growth rate continues</h2> <p>The rate of the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus has continued to slow in single digits, passing over 5,300 confirmed cases in Australia on Friday.</p> <p>Two more deaths were recorded in Victoria and New South Wales.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, said he was \u201cquietly pleased\u201d with the numbers slowing, but community transmissions had been growing. There are now 300 community transmission cases in Sydney, 60 in Melbourne and 30 in Brisbane.</p> <h2>National cabinet moves to \u2018suppression\u2019 phase</h2> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the national cabinet is moving from a phase of reacting to slow the spread of the virus to reviewing the measures put in place around restrictions and support. Morrison said if the rate had continued as it was a few weeks ago there would now be 10,000 cases, almost twice the current number.</p> <p>Morrison said after this phase, the national cabinet would move into a recovery phase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Commercial tenancy agreement delayed</h2> <p>The national cabinet has yet to agree to an industry code of practice between businesses and their landlords. The mandatory code would potentially require landlords whose tenants have a turnover of less than $50m and are participating in the jobkeeper program to waive rent in proportion to the loss of turnover for that business.</p> <p>Morrison said how that works will be negotiated between the tenant and the landlord.</p> <p>For residential tenancies, Morrison said there was a moratorium (which some have argued is not legally enforceable) on evictions, but he said that didn\u2019t mean there was a moratorium on rent. He said state and territory treasurers were still working on policies on residential rents.</p> <h2>Modelling to be released</h2> <p>Morrison announced modelling for how many cases and deaths Australia is expected to see from coronavirus will be released by the government next week after more work, and review by the national cabinet.</p> <p>There will also be a national dashboard of coronavirus data pooled from all the states and territories updated every afternoon. It is expected it will be available in the next few days.</p> <h2>Regional workers</h2> <p>Anyone on a working visa wishing to go work in a regional area where there is work will need to register with the government as self-isolating, and remain in isolation for 14 days before they\u2019re allowed to travel to regional areas.</p> <p>Local government workers are also not eligible for the jobkeeper program, as they are the responsibility of the states and territories.</p> <h2>NSW cruise ship stand-off ends</h2> <p>The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, announced that two Carnival ships that had been off the coast of the state had departed overnight, and another five Royal Caribbean ships would be leaving for their port of origin after refuelling and restocking on the weekend.</p> <p>A man was removed from the now-infamous Ruby Princess overnight for medical treatment. There are still six cruise ships off the coast of NSW, and 19 across Australia.</p> <h2>Asic warns real estate agents over super advice</h2> <p>The financial regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australian-real-estate-agents-face-fines-and-jail-if-tenants-told-to-use-super-to-pay-rent\">has told real estate agent institutes</a> in a letter to advise agents not to suggest renters in financial hardship use the up to $20,000 people can access from superannuation in order to pay their rent. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has warned such advice would be in breach of the Corporations Act, and those in violation of the law could face fines of up to $1.6m for companies, or five years jail for individuals.</p> <h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/01/when-is-it-legal-to-leave-your-home\">Full Story podcast: when is it legal to leave your home?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dua-lipa\">Dua Lipa</a> knew two things before starting the follow-up to her massive self-titled 2017 debut: she would call it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review\">Future Nostalgia</a>, and it would be \u201can album that was really fun and made me wanna dance and removed the outside world\u201d, she says. Few albums have fulfilled their intended purpose faster. Future Nostalgia was meant to arrive today, until an online leak brought it forward to the first Friday of Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Lipa wasn\u2019t sure it felt right to release it during the pandemic, but accurately concluded that her brilliant disco-wreathed anthems-in-waiting \u2013 the kind that transform kitchen tiles into a makeshift Studio 54 \u2013 might distract fans from the news.</p> <p>At the very least, a day of radio interviews and unceasing congrats stopped the 24-year-old from stressing about when to take her government-sanctioned daily walk. We FaceTime in the early evening of Future Nostalgia\u2019s premature birthday, Lipa at ease in a Christopher Kane \u201cTechno Sexual\u201d jumper, modish straw-on-tarmac hair tied up, saucer eyes unadorned. Like everyone, she has been self-isolating, eating chips and watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/a-zoologists-view-of-tiger-king-a-crass-expose-that-could-do-some-good\">Tiger King</a>. Unlike everyone, she is doing it in a plush Airbnb (her London flat flooded) with her model boyfriend <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fashion/article/dua-lipa-anwar-hadid-couple-dressing\">Anwar Hadid</a> (brother of models Gigi and Bella). Later, she will be conference-calling friends and family to \u201cdrink and dance through the phone\u201d.</p> <p>Although Lipa says today has felt like Christmas, it is still an anticlimactic arrival for an album that the British music industry has been banking on. Hers is the rare homegrown success not belonging to anyone named Sheeran or Adele, born from no-nonsense mega-pop in the vein of Britney and her idol Pink. In 2017, Lipa was the most-streamed female musician in the world. A year later, she became the first female solo artist to get five Brits nominations (she won two), and the youngest woman to break 1bn YouTube views with her video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU\">New Rules</a>, the single that transformed her from pop journeywoman to superstar. This January, it hit 2bn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj2U6rhnucI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nj2U6rhnucI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Success creates freedom and pressure, says Lipa. At 11 tracks, the focused Future Nostalgia bucks pop\u2019s trend for bloated, spread-betting albums that try to please all-comers. But her initial intention for the record \u2013 to have fun and ignore the world \u2013 came after online criticism threatened to dent her self-worth. \u201cPeople almost made me feel bad about my achievements, or didn\u2019t allow me to feel proud of the things that I\u2019ve done because they made me feel like I was almost unworthy of them,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I know I\u2019ve worked really hard and I did so much of the work, the performances and behind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>There are two key words here, the first being \u201calmost\u201d: Lipa is indomitable, not given to vulnerability, or at least not to showing it. The second is \u201cwork\u201d: Lipa\u2019s parents are Kosovar-Albanian Muslim immigrants who fled war-torn Kosovo for the UK in 1992. She was born in 1995, and lived in London until the family returned to Pristina when she was 10. At 15, she came back to pursue pop stardom, persuading her parents she would have a better chance of getting into a British university if she finished school here. Where most kids would go wild, Lipa grafted, pestered people with her demos and became an assiduous networker (the Instagram page for Girls Collective, a DIY talent agency she started with five friends, is still live). One connection led to another and she signed first with Lana Del Rey\u2019s management team, then to Warner Music.</p> <p>It took two years from releasing her debut single, New Love \u2013 showing off her trademark bungee-jump vocals and ex-vanquishing MO \u2013 to her first album. The latter was repeatedly delayed, Lipa a prime study of how pop careers build slowly and evolve publicly in the streaming era \u2013 and living proof of the \u201cadaptability\u201d she admired in her parents. \u201cWith every song, the momentum was building, but only tiny little bits,\u201d she says. \u201cI was doing new things, I was learning what was expected of me, how to be in front of a camera, how to better the last performance.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review\">Dua Lipa: Future Nostalgia review \u2013 a true pop visionary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her singles were not charting well. By the time she released two successive collaborations \u2013 modern pop\u2019s stabilisers \u2013 fans worried she was destined for pop\u2019s dumper. Then she unleashed the video to New Rules, \u201cand it was like rocket fuel\u201d, she says, a feminist sleepover fever dream and instant classic. It takes place in a luxury Miami Beach hotel, which she approached to fund the video, not because her label had shut its wallet, but in a savvy cash grab that let her \u201cpush it to another level\u201d. She never doubted her career prospects. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was gonna happen like this.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting pop\u2019s long game, Lipa won the Grammy for best new artist in 2019. The backlash took flight. \u201cPeople being like: \u2018She\u2019s been fucking best new artist for so long and she doesn\u2019t deserve that, blah blah blah,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThere were times that I felt people were being so mean that when someone recognised me and said: \u2018I really like your music,\u2019 I\u2019d be like: \u2018Oh my God, not everyone hates me!\u2019\u201d She says this with self-aware melodrama, though it echoes recent sentiments from Billie Eilish and Britney Spears: how dismal it must feel to see your hard work burned up by hatred.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d0e7cf38ffff942decc68efd955e0a8e1b728ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d0e7cf38ffff942decc68efd955e0a8e1b728ce/0_0_6439_8049/800..jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lipa hopes the #BeKind movement sparked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/04/caroline-flack-authorities-to-review-pursuit-of-assault-case\">Caroline Flack</a>\u2019s death might improve online discourse. \u201cThe scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind and really trying to get a rise out of people,\u201d she says. \u201cThe tabloids know very well what they\u2019re doing, and it really affects everyone. You have to be made out of steel to not let words get to you. It\u2019s so sad that we have to learn lessons from somebody\u2019s death.\u201d</p> <p>But then, maybe we are a long way off when, as Lipa says, \u201ccertain leaders are inciting racism and almost making it acceptable for people to be racist and treating people in very vile and disgusting ways\u201d. British political parties are \u201cabsolutely\u201d sowing such division, she says. \u201cYou have people like Nigel Farage, who is very openly racist and that is just shocking, and there are people who beat around the bush. They\u2019re racist but \u2013 it\u2019s such a mindfuck \u2013 they have a lot of people fooled.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lipa is unusually specific about politics for a pop star of her stature. It\u2019s not just \u201cvote\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cvote Labour\u201d, or \u201cvote Bernie\u201d, or \u201cFUCK THE PATRIARCHY I AM DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT HANDMAIDS TALE SHIT WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK\u201d after Alabama banned abortion. She credits her parents for her voice, saying she was raised \u201creally liberal\u201d. She is most concerned about UK immigration policy post-Brexit. Had it existed in the 90s, she thinks it would have stopped the Lipas fleeing Kosovo (where her mum was a lawyer, her dad a dentist-in-training) for the UK, where they worked as waiters and studied for new careers.</p> <p>\u201cIt upsets me that probably some of the younger generations of refugees don\u2019t really have the same opportunities that I was given because of the fortunate \u2013 or unfortunate \u2013 fact that my parents moved to London and I was born here and able to live my dream and do something on a global scale,\u201d she says. Whether post-Brexit Britain still offers those opportunities, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna have to see how everything works out\u201d, she says cautiously. Brexit has been upsetting: \u201cBeing from Kosovo, I know what it would mean for them to be a part of the EU and be accepted.\u201d</p> <p>It is an obvious thing to say about someone who frequently entertains packed arenas, but Lipa evidently wants to be heard. Although she occasionally jumps into the conversational deep end but grips the safety rail (a devout Labour supporter, she indicates that she is no Corbyn fan, but won\u2019t say so outright), she sticks to her chosen guns. She kept Future Nostalgia relatively short to hold listeners\u2019 attention spans. \u201cI really wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t any tracks you could skip,\u201d she grins.</p> <p>Pop\u2019s detractors like to point out that it is an industry where artists conform to conventions. In the immortal words of Eilish: <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\">duh</a></em>. Lipa is a canny operator who understood that she had to play a certain game to reach the point where she could be herself. (Her ambition/achievement conversion rate is a big part of her aspirational appeal.) Lipa was surprised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/11/this-years-male-dominated-brit-awards-have-an-issue-with-women\">the under-recognition of female talent at this year\u2019s Brits</a> \u2013 evidence, critics said, of the British industry\u2019s inability to develop female talent \u2013 but she is pragmatic about what might seem like a conservative feeder system where new acts spew out singles and accept every possible collaboration. \u201cArtists that are already well known get the upper hand, so you do have to get on those playlists as much as possible to be heard,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f4fcf6c7ae0625d5aa89284c1f50d5df8bf3cda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f4fcf6c7ae0625d5aa89284c1f50d5df8bf3cda/0_0_4904_3247/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa at this year\u2019s Grammy awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa at this year\u2019s Grammy awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Polk/Rolling Stone/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following Lipa\u2019s success, one such feeder system seemed to be getting young female acts to make their version of New Rules: Mabel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQKyDD9Yig\">Don\u2019t Call Me Up</a>, Ella Eyre\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDvD7Ko3IM\">New Me</a> and Anne-Marie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzD_yyEcp0M\">Friends</a> to name just three. (Incidentally, New Rules is the only one of Lipa\u2019s songs that she hasn\u2019t had a hand in writing.) She must have noticed. \u201cEr, have I noticed \u2026? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve noticed \u2026\u201d she says, her game face dropping to reveal that she has absolutely noticed. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK, though!\u201d she says when called on it. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different ways to say the same thing, make it honest and unique to you.\u201d She resists the idea that anyone is being told to recreate someone else\u2019s success. \u201cArtists do have a lot of control.\u201d</p> <p>Had Lipa tried to recreate New Rules for album two, \u201cI\u2019d just be in a vicious cycle\u201d, she says. She says she struggled to find her \u201clyrical language\u201d on her debut, feeling more at ease writing sad songs. \u201cI learned that I could write happy songs that are still really authentic and have the possibility of being cool and not seen as bubblegum.\u201d Most striking is how she sings about sex: mutually pleasurable, orgasmic transcendence mirrored in dazzling disco reveries. On Good in Bed, she nonchalantly celebrates \u201call that good pipe in the moonlight\u201d from a toxic ex-with-benefits. \u201cEverybody thinks that as a woman, you have to be so <em>careful</em> about how you portray yourself or how you talk about sex, and everything has to be really <em>sweet</em>,\u201d she says mockingly. \u201cIt\u2019s just very colloquial and how I chat with my mates.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t like to apologise if I don\u2019t believe I should be apologising for something</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Future Nostalgia ends with its lone ballad, the weighty Boys Will Be Boys, where a children\u2019s choir backs Lipa singing about how girls grow up faster in a world of male violence. She wanted to make something that felt like the moment the lights go on at the end of a party, \u201cso it would almost end a bit abruptly and maybe make you feel uncomfortable\u201d. She has grown less accommodating, a dynamic she dealt with in real life in January, when she attended Lizzo\u2019s Grammys afterparty at an LA strip club. After they were filmed throwing money at dancers with Rosal\u00eda, Lipa was accused of exploiting women, sparking the hashtag #dualipaisoverparty where users revelled in her \u201ccancellation\u201d.</p> <p>Lipa \u2013 who no longer goes on Twitter \u2013 did not respond. \u201cI don\u2019t like to apologise if I don\u2019t believe I should be apologising for something,\u201d she says now. \u201cI believe in supporting women in all fields of work. Nothing at that party was derogatory; everyone was just dancing and having fun.\u201d In our supposedly enlightened culture about sex work, she was surprised by the prudish response. \u201cThat\u2019s something we all have to work on,\u201d she says. \u201cNot every sex worker is being forced to do something they don\u2019t wanna do. I think a lot of the women found it really empowering and really like to dance.\u201d</p> <p>Women\u2019s work is always undermined, says Lipa. \u201cWe all have to work a little bit harder to be taken seriously, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re not used to doing,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes and grinning. She has pointedly described Future Nostalgia as \u201cfun\u201d even though she knows that is exactly the stick critics use to beat it with; that women in pop are only judged as \u201cauthentic\u201d when they are weeping by the piano. \u201cTime always tells,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cAnd in the meantime, I\u2019ll just work for people to take me seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 and 7 April 2020.

None of them are on site at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>His pickers remain in Slovakia, immobilised by a continent-wide lockdown. It is a similar story for hundreds of thousands of other seasonal agricultural workers who cannot travel just at a time when Europe needs them for harvests.</p> <p>Fruit and vegetable crops in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the UK and other countries risk rotting in the fields \u2013 putrefying testaments to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be pretty,\u201d said Eamonn Kehoe, a soft fruit specialist with Ireland\u2019s agri-food agency, Teagasc. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the staff it won\u2019t be picked.

We need people to be working in the fields, while also taking all the necessary health precautions. If we don\u2019t have anyone in the countryside to harvest the products, they\u2019re just going to stay there and there could be shortages.\u201d</p> <p>In the Andaluc\u00edan province of Huelva, for instance, only 7,000 of the 19,000 Moroccan workers who normally come had arrived before Morocco closed its border to passenger traffic.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> the need is even greater. Some 90% of its agricultural workers are seasonal, the majority from Romania.</p> <p>Massimiliano Giansanti, the president of Confagricoltura, the Italian agriculture association, said the sector needed 250,000 people to reap spring and summer harvests and to maintain vineyards.</p> <p>\u201cCoronavirus and blocks on transport mean that people who usually come from afar can\u2019t come, and those who come from within Europe need to do 14 days of quarantine upon arriving, and the same when they return home, so for this reason many prefer not to come.\u201d</p> <p>In Germany, which relies on about 300,000 seasonal workers each year, there is mounting concern that white asparagus \u2013 so beloved it is nicknamed \u201cwhite gold\u201d \u2013 and other vegetables will languish in fields.</p> <p>The German government has launched a website called <a href=\"https://www.daslandhilft.de/\">The Land Helps</a> to link farmers with volunteers willing to help out with bringing in everything from hops to potatoes. The appeal has been made in particular to millions of people whose workplaces have closed and students whose exams have been cancelled.</p> <p>France has lost many of its usual workers from Spain and Poland, as well as French workers who are at home sick or caring for children, causing a shortage estimated at 200,000 people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/a-beautiful-thing-the-african-migrants-getting-healthy-food-to-italians\">\u2018A beautiful thing\u2019: the African migrants getting healthy food to Italians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>African producers face their own crises. Pandemic-related restrictions have crippled Kenya\u2019s exports of green beans and peas to Europe, prompting producers to send half their workers home on mandatory leave. South Africa, another important exporter, is enduring one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns.</p> <p>If some harvests wither meals may look a bit less colourful for a while, but Europe is not going to go hungry. Food supply chains remain robust and supermarkets are keeping shelves stocked.</p> <p>And there is still hope that the continent\u2019s fruit and veg will end up on dinner plates. Governments are trying to create \u201cgreen lanes\u201d to allow fresh produce to circumvent restrictions on travel and commerce. The European commission has guidelines to try to extend that flexibility to seasonal agriculture workers.</p> <p>Many farmers are buying time by delaying harvests. Strawberry producers, for instance, are ventilating tunnels and removing their fleeces to lower temperatures and slow ripening. For John Greene this will push back his harvest from early May to early June \u2013 enough time perhaps for the Slovakians to make it to Wexford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ccb843ee391c54a031b95cb2133417944c015de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ccb843ee391c54a031b95cb2133417944c015de/0_138_4288_2573/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Strawberries at Greens Berry farm in Wexford, Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strawberries at Greens Berry farm in Wexford, Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Greene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The great hope is that across Europe students, refugees, the newly unemployed and others - what France\u2019s agriculture minister, Didier Guillaume, calls a \u201cshadow army\u201d of workers - will flock from cities to save harvests.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Country Land and Business Association has channelled the UK\u2019s second world war blitz spirit by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/20/farmers-call-for-land-army-to-sustain-uk-food-production-during-coronavirus-crisis\">calling for a \u201cland army\u201d</a> of new farm workers in England and Wales.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s agriculture minister, Teresa Bellanova, wants unemployed people to help farmers and work permits to be issued for asylum seekers and migrants. \u201cFor those who do not have legal documents, but who have perhaps worked in the fields, they should become legalised,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Many are sceptical city dwellers will respond: agricultural work can be tough, and another deterrent is fear of infection. But some people are already helping.</p> <p>In the Seine-et-Marne department east of Paris around 70 people from five migrant and asylum seeker shelters responded to the prefecture\u2019s call to harvest berries and asparagus. They will receive contracts and at least the minimum wage. However, some refugee advocates worried about \u201cmodern slavery\u201d while rightwing activists complained about their presence in France.</p> <p>Hundreds of people have volunteered to help bring in the asparagus harvest in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin.</p> <p>The crisis may have a silver lining. Consumers, perhaps to boost immune systems, have become healthier eaters, said Janusz Wojciechowski, the European commissioner for agriculture and rural development. \u201cConsumption of fresh fruit and vegetables in the EU has been booming in recent weeks.\u201d</p>",
